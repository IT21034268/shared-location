2,not what I expected,"I bought this game on suggestion from an email prompt for my kids and it's not at all like a video game. My family found it very repetative and slow. I also had trouble getting out of it when we finally figured out how to make the character move and realized it didn't get much more exciting than it was just sitting there.It was not at all what I thought it would be, although the characters were funny and very colorful."
3,I feel like I am back in the late 1980's!!,"I can't believe the format of this game. Unless you have a joy stick, it is very difficult to play. I thought using the key board to move a character went out with the the King's Quest games (even as old as they are, they are easier to play than this one). Even my 13 year old granddaughter found it difficult to move the characters. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have any trouble installing it. I also think the graphics are pretty good. All in all, I was really disappointed!!P.S. If anyone found a way to use a mouse on this game, please let me know."
3,"Excelent Graphics, Killer Jokes, But .............?????","Being a monkey island fan from the start, when i play any part of MI, i dont want to see Lawyers,Australian Landowner, Hostile takeover... etc. jokes in a pirate game. i think this part lost the carabian soul of the legendary Monkey Island,and one thing Guybrush is really annoying in this part, he is like a 8 years old kid,always wayning,"
4,Eveywhere You Go,Everywhere she goes people already know Rhiannon Taylor. The star from A Wing and a Prayer. Who wouldn't she's everywhere you go? Now she's been fired. This book is serious and funny at the same time. It shows how people really are. But I was expecting more pages.
3,Wayyy old...,"Ok well i got this game when the movie came out back in the mid 90's. I wouldnt dare play it anymore, but for someone with VERY novice gaming skills, its not a bad little strategy of a game. Its very easy to move bridges around, and the casualties and some strategy are suprisingly realistic for a game this old. Still, if you want great strategy go for TalonSoft's Battlground series games. If you want more action get Sid Meiers Gettysburg or Antietam"
5,A Wealth of Practical Information,"Alzheimer Solutions, a Personal Guide for Caregivers by Tim Knittweis & Judy Harch speaks simply and directly about the issues Alzheimer caregivers face. It addresses the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of the person with Alzheimer's as well as the problems created by the stress of coping with the disease on caregivers. The book is organized in a question and answer format which makes it easy to pinpoint the specific information that is needed as the disease progresses. It also includes references that caregivers can turn to for support. I wish I had this resource when my sister and I were caring for my mother."
1,Not much value,Work out was a repeat of what came with gym. Thought it would be a better video than what came with gym.
4,Hip music from a Louisiana legend,"""Dealin' With the Feelin'"" is the first nationally available CD from Lil' Alfred since his days with Cookie and the Cupcakes, and it's long overdue. From the opening trumpet blasts of the title tune, the CD perks and hops. Alfred's soulfull crooning of songs like ""She's Looking Good"" covers Wilson Pickett well, but it's the newer tunes like the title cut and the exceptionally grooving ""I've Got the Wrong Somebody"" that really make the album shine. Highly recommended for r&b fans who are looking for the real thing."
5,Excellent Cream!!!,"Love , love this product. Makes your skin so smooth, absorbes quickly and non greasy. Highly recommend."
5,Great little book!,"Da Boyz first outting, as Mr. Jones was doing covers for Knightfall, etc., and in between Red Rain and its sequel. Beatty adds dimension to Jones' pencils, much like Bob Layton did with MD Bright, Bob Wiacek did with Kev Hopgood and Terry Austin with John Byrne.It was a little tough to believe the Dark Joker didn't try opening the cask with the methods he uses AFTER the 20 years past when he first got it, but it's a minor beef.And the writing...Doug Moench was and is one of the greatest writers out there, very imaginative and just...great. I can't think of any other adjectives!Pick it up!"
1,"Doesn't Get Hot, quickly or otherwise","The package states that this iron heats up in less than a minute. I waited over 5 minutes, then ten and it did not heat up to a hot temperature at all. I thought maybe it had a ""shut-off"" sensor that shuts the iron off when not in use, so I used it after ten minutes of waiting. It still did not get even very warm. I could hold the metal rods IN MY HAND and they weren't hot enough for me to remove my hand. Maybe I have a defective curling iron or maybe it's junk.As to the question if the triple barrels give a good wave, I have no idea since the rods never did heat up enough to put a curl to my hair."
3,Beware!!!!,This reader requires a free ISA slot in your computer.99% of the computers in use no longer have ISA Slots but have the more modern 32-bit PCI Slots.
3,Not sure if installed correctly.,"I removed the cheap plastic bridge pins that came with my somewhat decent guitar, and replaced them with these. I did not notice a change in tone/sound quality, then again my ears are not much to brag about. They're holding the strings in, although it took some effort. I'm considering filing down part of them to make them fit onto the bridge completely. Not bad, not great."
5,Fossil watch for birthday present,Fossil Men's Gunmetal Dial WatchThe watch was delivered in good time and my son was really pleased with it - it is very classy. It is a great gift at a very good price as I got a sale price and the dollar/pound exchange because I live in the UK.
1,2 bads don't make a good,"The specs look great, and the features it has work great. Sound quality is amazing. But many parts of the device are cheaply made, such as the main navigaion/controll device, and the headphone jack, both things needed for operation of the player. Also if you're buying this for OGG or FLAC playback be warned it doesn't play many of these properly. Within two weeks the screen broke, I tried to get it repaired with Cowon but they where of no help, so I returned it to Amazon."
2,Buyer Beware,"I wanted to like this product.I really wanted to like this product.But I am severely disappointed.When I purchased the iAudio this past summer, I quickly learned that my unit had problems. When I moved an mp3 file onto the player, about 85% of the time there would be these weird skips and electronic noise associated with it. Sometimes deleting and reinstalling the file helped. Often it didn't.So I contacted their customer service, and updated the firmware as instructed. The problem was still there. So I returned it to Cowon, and they insisted that the player was fine.I sincerely doubt that random electronic noise is a feature, but once they say that there isn't a problem I don't know what else to do. So they sent it back to me. I've tried it out again, and the problems remain.On a lark tonight, I looked them up on the Better Business Bureau website. Their rating is an F. Go figure.I would not recommend this product."
1,Customer Centres are no good,It was a nice little thing for a couple of months. Then one of the days it stopped working.. Apparently that happens often with COWAN (where's the pride?). Since then it was repaired but it took some time...Since then it works ok.
5,X5L - The BEST out of the BEST still 2009,"There is still no comparison to X5L when it comes to sound quality! This is a very old player, but there is no new player, not even S9 can knock this one off. Certainly the best sound quality player in the world. Audiophier grade portable player!"
3,Where is the CD?,"I received this set with the book and recorder, but no CD as advertised! I was surprised, since Amazon is usually trustworthy about sending you things as advertised. The book is fun, and I'm finding it easy to learn to read and play notes on my recorder. But I'm surprisingly disappointed to not have the CD. Fooey!"
4,Vintage Dutch Swing College!,"I would like to buy it, but I have some of it already, but, I would certainly recommend it to those who love hot Jazz! One copy only! Go for it!"
5,Romp around Europe with 2 talented sons and their dad.,"Ignoring the typo's and the reminders of dad's knee replacements, this is a fun way to explore some of Europe and learn about WWII from an aging veteran as he passes his legacy on to his talented, albeit delightfully juvenile, sons. One can relate to many of the author's memories of his youthful pranks and escapades, appreciate the beautiful sketches and oil paintings included by his famous brother, Thomas Kinkade, and appreciate and admire his father's service to his country. The misadventures of these 3 on their trek through Europe had me laughing out loud while also encouraging me to ""go off the beaten path"" that tourists normally take, appreciate the stories of the locals, and experience what's down the alley and over the wall."
2,OUCH!,These are perfect for anyone on sodium free or a low sodium diet. Quality with a rare attribute. They still taste good! The down side is and has nothing to do with the product is they are approximately $22.00 higher here then other websites selling them on the net. Google and see for yourself. To add insult to injury the Vendor is going to make you wait for a three four day processing before they ship them to you. DUH! I have Amazon Prime and love it and buy most items here but this is one I took a pass on as the seller is selling at an awful hefty price in comparison to other vendors. I found them elsewhere for $27.00 a case! Shame on you Liquid Nation you will never get any of my business. I RATED THIS PRODUCT A TWO STAR ONLY BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE VALUE AND DISGUSTINGLY OBSCENE COST! As far as the product itself goes it's a five star.
3,pretty good show,"But the main reason to see this band with an orchestra is Conquistador. Brooker still sings well enough, but instead of the perfect solo played by Dave Ball in the original live recording we get a guy who does a little tapping and calls it a solo. Other than that major failing, we do get choral and orchestral arrangements which often add some nice new touches to familiar old songs."
3,Annoying video,"An interesting collection of mostly the same songs, many played quite differently with a full orchestra and choir. The sound, while good, does not have the richness and deep bass (especially in DTS) of ""Live at the Union Chapel"". But it is the video that is almost unwatchable. Instead of concentrating on the Procols, the video keeps cutting every second and a half to a different aspect of the orchestra, to Gary, to the orchestra, to the choir, to the conductor, to Gary, to everyone except Matt Pegg. Speaking of Pegg, where's his bass? I can't hear it. If there is only one DVD to buy, please get the Union Chapel."
5,legendary,dope!!! political and gangsta with dark beats that were way before dark beats were en vogue. classic lp and i need it on cd
5,very rare music recording,The Italian string Orchestra with the help of high quality musician Mario Brunello: in a very good live recording
2,Cycle World is NOT the best,"Magazine does not have enough road tests. Some months, there are no road tests, which is the main reason I subscribe to the magazine. There are way too many advertisements too. Motorcycle Consumer News has Cycle World beat hands down as it has no advertisements and cares less about what people, or manufactures think--they just report the truth!"
5,Street Bikes,"What can i say street bikes kick ass, although there are better magazines like sport rider but this one is still good especially for the price i got it for with 1 yr subscription."
1,magazine,Got my TWO issues today- don't appreciate getting the current one and last months' at the same time.It's like getting 11 issues for the price of 12.
5,Balanced Bike Mag,Great mag for everyone except Harley zombies. This and The Horse are my favorite reads.
3,Price,"This magazine was advertised on Amazon.com in an e-mail to me for a price of $2.97, how come I paid double that ??"
2,Boring magazine,"I love motorcycles and motorcycle magazines. However, I feel that Cycle World is probably the worst motorcycle magazine I've ever subscribed to. It's articles are redundant and poorly written. I am a sports bike fan, but this magazine is not for me. If you're into sports bikes, I recommend Sport Rider magazine. If you're not into sports bikes, I very much doubt you'll like this magazine. I will certainly not be renewing my subscription when it expires."
3,"Vintage British sci-fi/horror, good fun","Die-hard fans of vintage British science-fiction and horror will enjoy this low-budget yarn. There's a great cast including Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing (not seen enough, though) and Patrick Allen, the king of voiceovers who sadly died recently. It's all pretty silly, but entertaining. The director is the great Terence Fisher."
4,NICE and JAZZY,A friend of mine sent me this CD and I couldn't stop playing it. It was refreshing and relaxing. I couldn't believe that I had never heard of them. I have since spread the word about their music and purchased several copies of the CD to send to other friends. I only rated them with 4 stars becuase I wished there were more songs.
3,You have to drill 4 holes,"Description claims no drilling, not true. It seems ok as far as quality. I have no experience with other brands of Jeep side step bars."
4,Explorer Hut Review,We are very satisfied with this product. We have just begun to use it with the autistic children that we serve so I can't really say more yet.
1,not so good,"poor cooling fan, can not totally cool my laptop...product rcvd with broken ac adapter supply.replacement rcvd but still with chipped/damaged on the body. body is made of cheap kind of plastic."
4,good whether it's plugged in or not,"It's nice that it has external power, though it still isn't perfect for high-drain USB powered peripherals. It protects my lap and provides good ventilation for a hot notebook back with or without the fan running."
3,Eforcity Notebook Cooling Fan with Card Reader + USB Hub,"I love the fact that it is a hub and that it is a cooling table for my lap top but my computer has fell off of it several times, it needs something to make it not so slick so it will hold the computer with out slipping."
1,Bad Product,"The product is so bad, for the price you can buy something better. Defective usb and card reader, very small size, little scratches.I don't recommended it at all."
3,No for MacBook,This add-on has several problems:1. Too small a foot print for the MacBook Pro (ok for MacBook)2. USB hub seems doesn't work that well (multiple devices conflict)3. Power switch and connectors are on the side (front would be nicer)
3,"Does the job, but...............................","The chill pad works well at cooling my laptop. The double fan takes the heat away as advertised. The plastic construction seems a bit cheap and cannot sustain heavy impacts. WORKS, BUT REQUIRES CARE."
3,"OK pad, weak cooler","While I like the extra ports on the device (USB and card readers), the fans on y unit blow toward the laptop and do little to draw away the heat of my macBook pro (it kicks off a lot of heat in the back left corner near the power supply versus the middle where this cools). It being plastic, there is no radiant benefit and it seems a bit flimsy. For the money, not bad, just probably better with laptops that get hot in the center."
2,Uhm,"No me sirvio el hub usb 2.0, unicamente sirve como ventilador, si vemos la comparacion entre precio y lo adquirido, creo que es un buen balance, hubiera sido extra si el hub hubiere funcionado, sin embargo cumple unicamente la funcion de enfriar mi portatil."
1,It is just cooler.,It has many function. So I bought this one.but it doesn't work.It is just cooler.
1,Eforcity bombs,"The Eforcity came from China with no instructions, no cable, and no paperwork of any kind. Not Good! Since it was a third party gift, I couldn't ask the recipient to send it back to China."
2,OK but not as advertised,"The device seems to work just fine but it is not quite as advertised.The Eforcity Notebook Cooling Fan with Card Reader + USB Hub does NOT contain a card reader.It does, however, have a power input for the USB hub but no power adapter for it and no instructions on what power supply would be required if you wanted to use it.The fans seem to work OK and that's what I really bought it for. My computer does stay on it if the two little rubberized nubs at the back are flipped up.It's smaller than I expected, but that may be my fault. It does say ""notebook"" and I am using it on a MacBook Pro.If it hadn't said ""with Card Reader"" I would very probably have purchased a different product so I feel pretty gypped by the lack even if not so badly that I want return it."
1,terrible product,"Amazon order processing was great. HOWEVER, I recommend AGAINST this device for multiple reasons:- The device did not come with the required power adapter- This probably explains why the fans did not work at all- Very cheap construction- Poor grip design, even a small laptop slides around- The advertising on the box is contradictory. In one place it says 3 fans; in another, it says 2 fans."
3,"Decent, but no card reader.","I purchase this unit because it has 4 usb port which I was looking for, more usb ports, but I was very disapointed because there is NO CARD REARDER as advertise it has. It does a good job as a cooler,but I wanted more."
1,USB doesn't work on mac,"Looks like it's gonna long 2 or 3 weeks tops... and USB doesn't work on macI think that with this price its expectable, but looks much better on the picture, also It doesn't ave two cables as in the picture, just one"
5,One Satisfied Customer,"I am using the premier Alienware laptop for heavy gaming and it constantly overheats on me. Searching Amazon for a cooling fan I discovered this little beauty. Not only is it sturdy enough to hold the laptop, but the fans are almost noiseless. You only hear the soft whirring of fan blades as your laptop cools. An extra that I really enjoyed for this product was the USB hub. This allowed me extra USB ports for my accessories. THese USB ports take power directly from the A/C adapter, allowing my laptop to be free of the power draining USB devices that are usually attached to it. I reccommend this device to anyone with a laptop. For just $20 you get a device that will prevent any overheating or possible damage to your $$$ laptop."
2,Does Not Cool,"My old chill pad was getting old and not working properly, so I was in the market for a new one and came across this product. The reviews all seemed to indicate that it would be a good buy. I purchased the product and once it came I realized that it did not meet my expectations.The fans were very loud and after a few hours, my laptop was extremely hot. This item does not effectively cool my laptop. I ended up going back to my old one and I will now return this product. I will be looking for a new chill pad that works better than this."
5,Eforcity is a great seller,Eforcity has taken customer service to the highest level. The first cooling fan I purchased had a faulty AC power cord. Eforcity sent another entire cooling fan with a new power cord. The laptop cooling fan is very efficient and quiet. I love this product and seller.
2,Doesn't Cool Enough,"I own a Dell Inspiron 1501 and I have had problems with my computer turning off automatically due to heat. This product only extends the period of time that I can use my laptop, but my laptop will still turn off. This product's fans are not strong enough to cool my computer when I do my heavy duty projects. I don't recommend it. If it were just a fan, I would rate it a 1 star, but since it also contains extra USB hubs, I rated it 2 stars. Get a different fan."
2,Mediocre Product Poor Customer Service,"Despite the somewhat positive reviews of this product, my version started making noises 60 days after I purchased the product. I contacted the seller who gave me a cryptic, hard to understand message informing me they had a 30 day return policy. I expected the the seller to replace the unit since it failed shortly after purchase. Based on Eforcity's lack of response, this seller is not interested in replacing defective items.Avoid both this product and seller."
5,A Funky treat for anyone!,"I just got this album a couple of weeks ago and the first time I put it on, I was floored by the funky rhythms that fill this disc. Accompanied superbly by Charlie Hunter on the 8-string guitar and Skerrit on sax, Stanton Moore has definitely crafted one of the sickest albums around. In particular, track #3, Green Chimneys by Monk is a personal favorite on this album."
4,Great first record,"Stanton Moore pulled together regular pals Charlie Hunter and Skerik for most of the songs on All Kooked Out. Some songs have additional horn players, and two have neither Charlie Hunter nor Skerik. This is a fairly consistantly funky jaunt through the Stanton Moore/Skerik/Robert Walter/Charlie Hunter style. ""Green Chimneys"" is a slight disappointment, and the last three songs seem stuck on the end. Highlights includes the opener, ""Kooks on Parade"", ""Blues For Ben"" (with mile-wide swinging horns), ""Nalgas"" (which is one way of saying rear end in Spanish), and ""Stanton Hits The Bottle"" (silly but fun). If you like anything in the funk/jazzy/jam band minigenre, you'll like this CD."
1,No Credibility,Liz Trotta is not a person I would trust to give an unpartizan account of any sort of journalism. As a commentator for Fox News she regularly spouts simple minded talking points from whatever politically convenient campaign is nearby at the moment.There are plenty of books out there that examine the media in a much more enlightening and open light. Skip this one.
1,Who is this frau?,"Gee, I think Ms. Trotta would like to be given credit for the assassination of an American senator, eh? She would have felt right at home in Nazi Germany, where calling for the death of a political opponent was completely acceptable.Why are we stuck with these monsters? How can we get them to climb back under their rocks???"
4,These are great for preschoolers,"My son is having to re-learn his alphabet and get familiar with letters. We haven't used them in the sandbox yet, but he lines them up on the floor and picks out certain letters. They are colorful and a decent size."
3,Shower bag thoughts,So the one thing I didnt see when I placed my order for this shower bag was the length of the shower hose. It is way to short. I will be adding on a new hose as the one that comes with the bag is about 8 inches long. Everything else about the bag is pretty good. I like the pockets to hold soap and the mirror is a nice touch. The handle is well made and the over all quality is good. If they just gave you a longer hose it would be excellent.
4,"Handy, to keep the dogs Kool",This i used this camp shower in a alligator infested waters to wet my dog. It wasn't safe to go in at that time. It holds water well and the spout is O.K. and easy to handle.Lorrie
5,I love this shower,"We went to Mexico on a camping trip, and bought a cheap $10 solar shower for my dad, and this one for us three girls. This shower was amazing. I love how it tells you how hot it gets. The first two sunny days, it was 116 degrees. My mom said it was TOO hot for her. Haha. Then next day was a little overcast, and it was 104 degrees. Still was an awesome shower. The last day was cloudy but the water STILL reached 92 degrees. Nothing broke, I like the cap (it doesn't leak like the Coleman one), and it's very sturdy to hold 5 gallons of water."
5,Outstanding product!,"For some reason my review (along with 30 + others) don't show up on this page. So I thought I would post the link to the other reviews (http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Elements-Gallon-Summer-Shower/product-reviews/B000J2Q0T4/ref=cm_cr_pr_btm_link_next_3?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&pageNumber;=3) along with my original review.Utilized this shower for 4+ months shared between 5-6 men. It is small enough that it dosen't present any sort of physical challenge when carrying it around, the nozzle sprays in a decent pattern and it is durable (survived temperatures in excess of 100 degrees on a daily basis, thrown around etc..). After 4+ months of constant use it was turned over in a serviceable condition to the next group who took our place. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple, compact field shower."
4,Plenty of Warm Water!,This shower was great for camping! We set it out in the sun during the day. In the evening there was plenty of warm water for four of us to take turns getting clean.
3,Could be better,"We are using ""solar shower"" as an outdoor sink and shower. The tube came kinked and always wants to fall into that position which stops the flow. The nozzle leaks unless we get it above the highest point of the water. It does warm up in a day of full sun but generally these two issues make it far from a high quality product. My concern is that it will not take long for the kinks to become cracks especially with this thing in full sun."
3,Advanced Elements 5 Gallon Summer Shower / Solar Shower,The construction and overall usability of this item is great but getting and keeping the water hot/warm was the problem as once the water is warm it doesn't stay that way for very long. For something in this price range I was expecting a little more.
5,warm water,the nicest sun shower we have experienced...nothing like a warm shower after being in the woods all day....or out hunting in the winter
5,Awesome,Awesome product...I plan on getting another! I am a prepper and I plan on staying clean. This product is perfect for maintaining good hygiene!
4,Great,I haven't used it yet. It will be convenient for the summer camping. I read the reviews on here and thought I would give it a try
4,Liked it,"Fits the phone well. Detach mechanism for the phone seems secure, but is workable with one hand. Belt clip is very secure.Two minor complaints in order of annoyance:1) the outward-facing part of the clip that holds the phone in place is somewhat sharp, and I frequently catch an arm or a sleeve on it. Would be nice if it was more rounded.2) the case is then enough to flex, and with a little pressure it easily flexes, buttons get pressed, and the phone beeps. Not the end of the world by any means, but slightly annoying.Overall, I'd recommend it."
5,Excellent Product!,"Product was as describe, lasted quite a good while even thought the phone has outlived the clip, I still have the phone but the clip got broken, cannot really complain about it and cannot expect it to last forever right."
1,Drivel,This book is so bad that it's sort of funny. The author must have had the thesaurus at his side while writing--there are more colorful unnecessary adjectives in this book than anything. It's reminiscent of stories one would write in junior high. Awful.
3,"Regrettably, this one falls short","The idea of this book is good: include a variety of voices in a methodical coverage of basic photography topics and techniques. The result did not live up to the expectation, however. While the list of topics was good, the treatment was often shallow. (The ""tips"" and sidebars were distracting and seldom helpful.) Worse, several of the photographs were not well executed, in my view! Overall, I did not feel that my technique was improved having read this book.Having said that, I did like the idea of including advice from a variety of practitioners. Aaland (and others) also provided sketches of their setups, which I found interesting.My advice: wait for the second edition when hopefully a good idea will be improved. Meanwhile, wanna buy mine?"
5,Great for the intermediate digital photographer,"This book is clearly not pointed at true beginners (and says as much). It fills a huge gap in the existing material, a book for the intermediate shooter. I teach a digital photography class at the local community college, and the author addresses most (if not all) of the questions that the more experienced students ask. My students are not professionals, many are beginners, and I recommend this book to any students that might want to continue their studies. The book is also not for the advanced photographer, is a great middle step for those that find ""beginner"" books to basic, and feel they don't quite understand some topics in ""advanced"" books."
2,not very useful,"I'm not sure what this book is supposed to accomplish. It doesn't teach fundamentals of photography -- it assumes you already know a lot; it uses some technical terminology that is never explained. But it also doesn't teach specific techniques (for the most part). It's just a bunch of vague recommendations, and it feels like the author just had to fill a number of pages with words to fulfill the terms of his contract so he could get paid."
5,shooting digital,"practical information for the digital camera enthusiast who is also in search of fundamental photographic priciples and techniques for shooting portraiture, still life, landscapes, etc."
1,"""Stupid is as stupid does"", Forest Gump","I have only read the the first 25 pages of this highly anticipated read and so far the author has amazed me with such invaluable tidbits of knowledge as:Make sure the lense cap is offMake sure the camera batteries are chargedMake sure the attached supporting equipment is properly connected.EtcEtcI hope the rest of the book has something,anything, useful to say to help get me out of this purgatory.I will dutifully follow up with another critique if this book begins to show value."
3,"OK, but wish there were better examples","I enjoyed the book.I felt like I learned things about taking digital photos from this book, but I was left wanting more side by side examples. It seemed like the author utilized photos from other people that he liked, instead of taking a more deliberate approach, such as discussing a technique, then showing you two pictures, one taken using auto settings and one using the technique. (That way you could have a concrete example of the difference the technique made). He does this occasionaly, but it would've been nice if he had done it with each technique.I also felt like I was over bombarded with RAW format propaganda and advertisements for his books on Photoshop Elements and Photoshop.I wish he would've discussed how the use of filters has been affected by the switch from film to digital photography."
1,Bad Imitation,"This is a bad imitation of a 70's collection. This CD or CD's are a ""farce!!!"" I want my money back. After listening to one or two selections, it was clear they lied about this being the original artists!!! BE HONEST!!! There is no reason to fabricate music! When people want to hear original recordings, and they pay for it, then that's what you send them!!!"
1,AWEFUL - Should have said Re-recordings of the original songs,"I now know to read the real small print here at Amazon.com - it does say new recordings with original artist. However, it does not mention that the recordings are possibly decades later. So it is really not the best of the 70's, more like the 2000s version of the 70's classic. I downloaded it for my IPOD. Imagine my disgust when I finally was able to hear the recordings and thought Amazon should have better described the item. Next step is deleting them from my IPOD library. Re-recordings, Re-productions, or Re-done should have been on the item cover. However, I should have read the other reviews before I bought it. I now have to treat Amazon like eBay - buyer be very aware of the product descriptions. Even Mattel described their Barbie ""reproductions"" not a new production of the original dolls."
5,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!,"This is an amazing cd. It will evoke so many different emotions. If you're as big a fan of Sade as I am, then you'll really enjoy this cd, as it shares similar elements as Sade's music. And like Sade's music, Fertile Ground's music is also classic!"
3,Not bad but not great - not really what I was expecting,"I guess I breezed over the part where the songs on this album were remade and thought this was an actual ""greatest hits"" cd when I picked it up. There are a few songs where the energy is great, Code Blue for instance, but really, it just all isn't there. If you can find this one used it is worth picking up for sure, but if you're looking for the original classics pass and find the originals, this one just isn't the same. The album isn't bad, but it just misses on so many levels that it isn't great either."
5,live to ride,"cool documentary about club life...I'm a lone wolf, but would have loved to be apart of a brotherhood like that.great inside to the lifestyle."
1,choppertown-sinners,"it would be nice to give a review,if i ever get it!! you took my money pretty quick, but no product!! its been since 7/16/12;a month. its just a dvd--how hard could that be? richard king"
1,Buyer Beware,"Looks to me that what these people sell is the download version of SuSE, and not the retail package version. The retail version includes additional commercial versions of, for example, OCR software, and more .. I think using the retail package graphics is at least misleading if not unethical !L.T."
3,I'm a little disappointed,"I'm a longtime SuSE user. I've been using SuSE since version 5.x. The only reason I bought 8.2 pro was for the directory encryption, which according to the SuSE.com website is new for version 8.2. I couldn't find the documentation for it, so I posted a message to the support mailing list, and got not one single response. I eventually figured it out myself. It appears that this is nothing more than loopback encryption (which has been around since version 7.3) which if my assessement is correct, makes me wonder what else is renamed and not necessarily ""new""."
4,Delivered as advertised,The book was in good condition and helpful to me in my research. It is about a transcontinental road trip that eventually led to the federal highway system.
1,pumpkin carvers,very dissapoointed the blades that came with the package broke the minute i tried to start carving our pumpkin. I never got to use the product at all.
1,Absolutely Worthless,"Everything was going fine until it came time to actually use the stencil.After cleaning out the pumpkin, I used alcohol to clean the outside of the pumpkin so that the stickers would hold better; what a waste of time that was. The stickers kept coming loose and the stencil wasn't held tightly against the pumpkin, but that was hardly the main problem! As soon as I started to cut through the pumpkin, the juice, created from carving, quickly saturated the ""non water proof"" stencils and they just shredded to the point that you couldn't tell where the lines were anymore.I gave up after the first stencil and just threw the rest of them out. Thank God I only wasted a few bucks, and maybe that's what this company's intent was anyway."
2,clumpy,"This was one of the worst mascaras I have tried. From the first use, it was clumpy, and it just got worse with each use. Besides the clumps, it made my eyelashes heavy and caused them to hang annoyingly in front of my eyes! Not cute."
1,Labelled incorrectly,I bought the medium ball for my height. It does say 65 cm. I've measured this ball too and it is not the 22inches in height that your supposed to have for my height. This makes the ball useless for my exercises it doesn't even measure 20 inches for the small ball. Mine measures 17 inches height. Someone isn't checking the quality control of this product there should not be this much difference. They've got the colors right for the height but that's all.
5,Not just for yoga!,"This makes a great tool for labor and delivery too! It was a life saver when I was in labor with my son. And it's fun now that he's older too, he loves to play with it and we bounce together on it (better than walking another five miles to calm hiim when I'm already too tired to stand)."
3,Good introduction,"I wanted to find out more about balance balls in general, and I have enjoyed this kit. The balance ball is just right for me size-wise. It's a medium, which is suppose to be too big for me because I'm only 5'2""; but it's just right. Taller people should select the larger ball.The ball itself is sturdy and made from good material although I'm sensitive to smells and the plastic/rubber smell at first was too much. The smell does dissipate once the ball is in the air. There was also a cheap blow up mechanism for the ball, but we managed to get the ball inflated after a few struggles.There's an introductory DVD that I've played a few times, and it has helped me to learn the basics and actually get some exercise.I would recommend this kit to someone who is interested in adding the balance ball to their exercise regime."
3,A great way to exercise,"The video that comes with it is a bit dull and slightly repetitive, probbaly to get you to buy the other videotapes that go along with it. The ball is a real pain to blow up. Once it is blown up its a great way to exercise."
2,"ball good, pump is junk","The ball seems fine, but the pump broke the second day I used it.Now it looks like I will have to pay another $20 or so to get another (? better) pump shipped, and have not been able to really use my underinflated ball. It was a bad choice"
2,Better Off Buying JUST The Ball!,"Yes, the fitness ball is an absolutely wonderful idea. But I must say- don't waste your time with the video. The lower body workout was a joke- it felt more like just a series of stretches. The ab workout was better- I at least felt a little burn. The upper body workout does work out the back, though. Please keep in mind this video is more of a promotional montage of their other workout videos and is primarily designed to give you a sample preview so that you will buy the other videos. It is not a suitable substitute for even a beginner's workout. My recommendation would be to buy the ball and the body-part specific videos separately and don't waste your money on this so-called ""kit."""
5,The oerfect travel mug,I purchased this product in order to easily travel with my homemade smoothies. I love the handle and the sturdy top. I have mixed my smoothies in the mug and then froze them until the next day. It is a fantastic product. I will be ordering more of them.
2,Tool for arabic propaganda and imperialism!,"To read a more authentic account read Karen Armstrong's book ""Muhammad"", and better still "" Why I am not a muslim"" by Ibn Warraq."
5,Quality Item At A Resonable Price,This Was A Great Item Item For A Gift. It Was Shipped Quickly And It Was Described Just The Way I Got it. The Quality Was Great Toon
2,A diappointing read,"I found this text to be a disappointment. Some mateial seemed contradictory--- borderline inaccurate. Upon completion of the text, it raised more unanswered questions rather than thoroughly answering them."
3,Heat and wiggle,"I like the ease of assembly. Unfortunately the wing-nut and bolt provided do not prevent a little wiggle where the legs attach to the exerciser. Also, after about five minutes of use the pedal assembly squeaks and heats up. Furthermore, the foot straps do not fit over my shoes easily. All that being said, it does provide me the exercise I want."
2,"depressing, dark, devoid of hope","This book made me want to weep. A study in the downward spiral that we all ride only to find ourselves at the end of the rope, the chair kicked out from under our legs."
3,side two,"dear Mr. Belew,you are a fine guitarist, full of creativity and talent. your Side One and Side Two albums (or should i say ep's) are both full of lively playing and overall, retain your generally high standards of song writing. i appreciate your balance of pop, progressive rock stylings, and a drive for the experimental.but please please please... find a suitable graphic artist to design your album covers. do not subject your fans to your own lifeless, dull, and excrutiatingly awful paintings ever again. you put the ""pain"" in paintings. remember Adrian, guitar, yes...canvas, no! no! no!"
5,adrian belew side two,"part two of the genius trillogy by adrian belew, ""side two"", does not dissapoint.it starts out with ""dead dog on asphalt"". funny story for me, adrian's daughter sent me a message on myspace, and told me adrian ran over a dog in his truck, coming home one night. he was so depressed, that he wrote this song about it!all songs on this album were done with the looper, an apple computer and software instruments, as well as guitar and adrian's unmistakable vocals.""asleep"", which was originally a download only track, was inspired by the tragic world trade center bombings, 9/11/01. this version, however is longer, and a different mix than the other, so you are in for a treat!""sex nerve"" sort of builds on a track from the king crimson e.p., ""happy with what you have to be happy with"" called ""she shudders"".""sunlight"" has a sort of 70s europop feel to it.i feel this release is the strongest of the trillogy, though none of them dissapoint!"
3,smoother electronica sounds,"The disc is a smoother listen than ""side one"". In addition to what the previous reviewers noted, a few of the songs had hints of Thomas Dolby and the 80's new wave. Good, but overall not as strong as side one (accounting for the differing styles). The haiku's are emotive, strong and succinct. Much of the instrumentation is compelling, but some just feels incomplete.The best: Face to Face, Sex NerveThe really good: Dead Dog, AsleepI found Happiness and Sunlight to be rather slight, and the rest somewhere in between. Worth getting, but not essential."
2,Where is the cinnamon flavor?,This tea was shipped quickly and well packed but really lacked flavor. Not a hint on cinnamon and only a mild flavor of basic tea. I even steeped it for several minutes starting with boiling water.
5,ON THE ROCKS ROCKS & PROUD WORDS SING,"URIAH HEEP'S SINGER DAVID BYRON AND KEYBOARD/GUITARAND SONGWRITER KEN HENSLEY RELEASED THESE TWO SOLOEFFORTS AND AS A HEEP FAN I WAS QUITE SUPRISEDBY JUST HOW GOOD THEY ARE. BYRON'S BAND HAS THATBRITISH STONES/FACES FEEL. SONGS LIKE REBECCA,LITTLE BY LITTLE AND START BELIEVING ALL COULD'VEBEEN RADIO HITS. TOO BAD. KEN HENSLEY HAS A SLOWERFEEL LIKE HE DID WITH HEEP. THE ORIGINAL VERSION OFRAIN THAT WAS ON MAGICIAN'S BIRTHDAY IS HERE AND HESOUNDS LIKE BYRON SINGING IT. BUT OTHER SONGS LIKEFROM TIME TO TIME, KING WITHOUT A THRONE AND THECOUNTY SOUNDING LAST TIME MAKE IT WORTH A LISTENOF ANY FAN. I'VE HAVEN'T TAKEN IT OUT OF MY PLAYERSINCE I GOT IT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANY HEEP FAN."
4,AF does not operate on D3000/5000 per description.,"This lens is a great Manual lens for Nikon D3000/5000 cameras. Unlike other manual lenses, the camera recognizes it and asks that it be on F22 when you power on. The clarity and sharpness is great, even on 300mm."
1,Do not purchase! Broke first time used! Manufacturer won't replace parts.,"The first time I used this a slight breeze came up, it tipped over slowly, and three joints snapped in half. They are cheap plastic. I emailed the manufacturer and they wanted me to spend another $20 plus shipping for the cheap plastic joints. Unbelievable.Don't waste your money. I now have to buy another unit. VERY disappointed with the unit and the LACK of customer service."
1,Cheaply made,"The top connector snapped the first time it was used. The zipper on the bag broke, and while installation was easy, when disassembling, one of the chained leg connectors broke.This is being returned, and I wouldn't recommend it anyone."
1,Fragile pole connectors break at the first gust of wind,"I purchased this tent last summer. The very first time a gust of wind tipped it over (which was during assembly!), several of the plastic pole connectors snapped into pieces. The company was good enough to send more, which I appreciated, but these, too, were fragile. The same thing happened, but this time after I had the whole thing assembled and staked down. A gust of wind came along, the structure tipped over, and three of the connectors shattered. Perhaps if the stakes that come with the product were longer (they're only 5 inches or so) they would stand up to a little wind better. Bottom line for me is I will never again buy such a product unless it has metal connectors."
1,A Product Well Worth Returning. I did.,"The product I received was different from the picture on Amazon and from the picture on the product storage bag. The sides stopped 4"" above the ground and the floor was unattached to the rest of the shower/shelter combo. The manufacturer's warrantee covers only the shower/shelter, not the poles. One 2-part pole finally fitted together, but a second pole was damaged (the part inside the pole holding the folding pieces together) and would become unusable and unwarranteed with subsequent use. The assembly instructions refer to parts not included. A step is left out saying to put the 'ceiling' assembly on top of the lower retangular assembly before assembling the vertical poles. The product documentation says the shower/shelter combo is intended to collapse in high winds to cause the least damage. Yet I was unable to use stakes on the four vertical polls, since the polls were 4"" longer than the ring to be staked in the ground."
3,"Works well, needs some improvements","I think the shower worked pretty well. The water definitely heats up in when you place the bag in the sun. The frame is easy to put up and take down, and goes back in the bag too which is rare.Here's the down sides: The frame is a bit flimsy when you hang a full 5 gallon bag from the top. The frame tweaked to one side and had a hard time standing up because of the weight. Once the bag drained some, it was better. We had it set up on slightly uneven ground so this may not be a problem if you can find level ground to put it up on.Also, the hose has a habit of coming off of the bag. A simple hose clamp or tie wrap would fix this, but even better is to find a better piece of hose (the supplied hose kinks easily stopping all water flow). Get a real hose and a clamp, and no more problems.Overall I think its worth the money, but just needs a couple of small improvements."
1,Complete and total piece of garbage,"This thing is a piece of trash. The poles are supposed to fit together, they don't. The assembly instructions consist of one page with some steps with no pictures. The instructions do not make sense at all. The skin of the item is okay, but the frame (poles, joints, etc) are garbage. Also, don't attempt to hang a full shower bucket or the whole thing will collapse. The only good thing about this product is that it is very spacious."
5,Awesome,"I am really thrilled with my Deluxe Camp Shower-shelter combo,have put it up and it is better much better than the first picture. The colour is perfect and with the other items how could you go wrong. My family are right into camping so this is going to be a big hit for all. The directions are easy to follow and the pieces came together hey even my three year old grand-daughter helped.I do like the towel holders with in reach and the holders for toiletry's you can't get anything like this in New Zealand.I recommend to anyone especially (wahine) women who need these facilities I love it to bits thank you Amazon and Texsport the creatorsMatipo"
2,disappointed poor attacement,"I bought this shower in Feb anticipating a trip in Sept. Putting it together, the silver clips did NOT slide into the holes to make is stable. I little wind storm tipped it and it came apart where it was not solidly clipped causing it to twist, breaking 2 of the corner plastic connectors. We used duct tape to hold those corners together to finish out the week. The showers were great. The zipper came apart the first time I used it but the door still covered enough that I was comfortable showering in the great outdoors"
2,too bad it broke,"this worked great for about an hour, then the plastic brackets broke and rendered the shelter useless. the shower bag also leaked. this was a big disappointment."
5,Great!,We use this for a privacy area in the campground for my grandmother to use with a port a potty. Works great
3,Just a tall tent.,"Nothing too special, just a tall tent. The solar shower bag that comes with it is totally junk though. I bought a small propane water heater and pump and it worked great!"
3,Do you really need it?,"We purchased the shower/shelter combo for out porta potty and for showering. It works for both. On the plus side the zipper works well, there is plenty of headroom, two towel racks, a floor cover and it comes with a place to put your toiletries. It was fairly easy to assemble but when we were disassembling it for the second time the top plastic bracket broke. It did not take much stress for it to snap. We still will be able to use it but it is disappointing that the plastic is not sturdier. The metal sections are okay but the connectors are fairly useless. Overall it works as a basic shelter but long term use may destroy it."
5,TexSport Camping Shower Shelter,"After trying a couple of other brand/models it is a real pleasure to use the TexSport. Goes up easily & is very sturdy when pegged down correctly. Well designed & the 'extras' such as poly floor, towel bars, shower caddy, etc., are great. I like this unit best of all similar items available."
1,Not worth the money,"We purchased this camp shower based on the reviews we read on this website. Unfortunately this product is not worth the effort of pressing a few buttons to order it. The problem was the poles. They are very flimsy and bend very easily. Of course that is the only part not under warranty. I will return the product, however, the company does not offer refunds, only replacement of faulty parts except the poles. I could be out the money. Very frustrating."
2,"This is not what I recieved, but what I ordered","I received a hanging shower not the one I ordered, it would be nice to receive what I ordered..so I feel you should make the company make things right.."
4,Nice shower enclosure with a few liabilities,"Took my wife and me about 15 minutes to set this up. Overall construction and quality was fine. Instructions were clear and concise.Pros:--Good quality--nice size--zippers work well and are durable--Includes a nice little soap holder thingyCons:--Having the top entirely enclosed traps all the little critters you don't want to shower with. Mosquitoes are especially bad. We ended up cutting out two of the top mesh panels to allow easy egress for the bugs.--The included shower, IMHO, is useless.--You need your own stakes and rope to really make this stable in any type of windy environment.--Soap holder thingy has a bottom pocket that traps all the water--Soap gets mushy really fast if left in the holderWe used this all summer and intend to continue to use it next year."
2,Polea are weak,As soon as you hang the bag up the poles feel like they are going to brake.Its a good toilet house.
1,not what i ordered,"i ordered the deluxe camp shower from fogdog, they sent me the regular camp shower. i was very upset and disappointed with my experience with this company."
1,couldn't stop laughing,"Completely ridiculous, if you find using a man wielding a box cutter scary watch this film. The acting sucks to the point of no return. I couldn't feel anything but contempt at the bogus claim that this movie is remotely frightening. Nice catchy title for a useless crappy film is all I can say."
2,This album is a re-recording of Chubby's hits.,"If you're a true-blue fan of Chubby Checker, as I am, this will only mildly interest you. The musical arrangements are loose (the producer should be horse-whipped!). Chubby's fan club president just informed me that he has heard from the owner of Chubby's former record company, Cameo-Parkway Records (that would be the infamous Allen B. Klein of ABKCO Records, NYC) who has been swearing that he is preparing a huge compilation of ""Greatest Hits"" packages of all the original Cameo-Parkway hits, including Chubby's original hits. So far, nothing has been forthcoming for the two years since he made that comment!"
2,Not The Real Stuff,"If you're looking for the original PARKWAY recordings, this is not it. These are re-makes of Chubby's hits recorded in the last few years by the original twister. They don't sound like the original's (at all). Wait till CAMEO PARKWAY releases them. Maybe soon!"
2,"Can't you,please?",Certainly a bad re-recording.At Europe there are bootleg-cd's with the original hits of most of the Cameo-Parkway artists.But it will be necessary that Abkco publishes them mastered from the original tapes.Can't you please?
3,Chubby for Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!!,"I'm still a fan of Chubby Checker. Although this is a re-recording of his hits it gives evidence of his amazing vocal talent. Too bad that the production wasn't up to the challenge. Thanks for mentioning that ABKCO Records might release material from the original vaults of Cameo-Parkway Records (Chubby Checker, Tymes, Dovells, Orlons, Dee Dee Sharp, Bobby Rydell, ? and the Mysterians). Now my interest is piqued."
3,Chubby is a Good Vocalist Hit&Miss Material,Chubby Checker is a Good Vocalist but this Material doesn't fully capture his Ability.He was more than the Twist.
2,Worth the money.,"PS2 is much smaller, slimmer and lighter and does not take upmuch space. For children PS2 can provide as much enjoyment as thehigher priced PS3."
3,So far so good,"If you don't purshase the memory 8 MB, the second controller and any game, you don't gonna enjoy this product. I recomended that this product will sale with this other product, I meant, ready to play."
5,PS2 is Excellence,Playstation 2 has kept the fun level up & the stress level down. It is good stuff.
5,"Slim, streamline, and stylish","A great buy for anyone looking to purchase a Playstation 2. The size has been reduced by more than half, and it's about half as heavy (about the size and weight of a book). There have been rumors of a overheating issue, but mine hasn't gotten as warm as the old PS2 because I keep it on a cookie cooling rack. It didn't even get warm after 8 straight hours of playing Kingdom Hearts. The top-loading drive is more convenient than the tray drive, however the first time I put a CD in, it came up with a disc read error. It turns out that I hadn't pushed the CD in until it snapped into place, and I haven't gotten an error since then. I have had no issues with my unit, and would recommend it to anyone out there who has been considering this model. Sony outdid themselves on this one. Great product!"
5,AWESOME!!!!,I GOTTHIS ITEM 5 DAYS EARLIER THEN PROMISED. THIS WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. I HAVE NEVER PURCHASED AN ELECTRONIC ITEM ONLINE. AND NOW BECAUSE OF THIS COMPANY I WILL SHOP FOR ELECTRONICS ONLINE AGAIN ND PROBABLY FIRST. THANK YOU
2,Not that good,I recieved this thinking it would be really good an was told it was but it is not that good there is some weird white marks on the top that won't come off and there is a lot of scratches on some parts of the console and when playing the console like every half hour it would freeze and sometimes the game will pop back on but others it compleaty froze I know it is not the disks because there scratchless. I was also promised a controller but it didn't work only some buttons do and if I shook it I could hear some rattling inside so I unscrewed the controller and some of the prong things holding the top buttons work broke off. I'm not to happy.
4,PS2 Console,"This was actually a replacement console for one that was broken by accident. My son plays his PS2 games all the time and just loves it! I like this particular console, because it is slim and can easilly fit on his cluttered dresser (lol)! I recommend this console for those who can't afford the newer PS3 model (I sure CAN'T!!)and who want a space-saving product for their kids' (or spouses)!"
2,it was the older model. not a slim,"i received the product quickly and in decent condition. i do not however appreciate the deceiving title of 'slim console"". it was not a slim console, but the older, bulky model."
5,great service,My son ordered this product because his old system was broken and could not be repaired. He received the new system in perfect condition and was surprised at such fast delivery. I recommend Amazon.com and the seller for any future purchases.
1,Pathetic quality of the Sony PS2 77001,"I purchased this unit in January 2007 for use by my Grandson. Since this purchase my Grandson has been able to play this unit perhaps 4 times. I just received my 3rd replacement from Sony and it failed to work right out of the box. The units have not been mistreated, dropped or otherwise abused. I am disgusted with the pitiful quality of Sony's products. The first 2 units were returned for the ""does not read disk"" error. This last one, fresh from Laredo TX, simply grinds the laser into the center column. I would strongly advise anyone to avoid this system like the plague."
1,Best console ever for its generation,Si todavia no tienes un PS2 esta es tu oportunidad de conseguirlo. La version SLIM es la mejor xq' no solo es mas compacta sino de la ultima referencia capaz de pilotar todos los ultimos juegos nuevos ke en la version FAT ni sikiera arrancaban.
4,ps2 console,"My children love the ps2, I have to limit their time on it or they would play it all day."
3,just note,"The only differneces between the new slim and the old playstation 2 is a cooling issue. But, you have to leave the slim on for hours to overheat. Also, the slim's CD reader holds the disc which allows easier CD read."
5,Worth it,"Great system, works really well. I haven't been around a PS2 for quite some time and decided I wanted to catch up on all the great games you can find for this system. Two recommendations, first if you have an HDTV, buy a component cable (red, white, read, blue, green wire) for PS2. They can be found for a really great price, just look around. Without the component cable, using the wires that came with the PS2 it wouldn't show in color on my HDTV. Secondly, you might want to contact the seller and make sure any accessories that come with the system work. My controller has a minor defect but it's no big issue as the seller had no problem replacing it. I found it to be a worthwhile purchase."
3,All there but no memory card,"I didn't realize the memory card is a requirement for PS2. I wish it were suggested I purchase one, by someone."
3,"eh, Coldplay-lite","This band is just ok. I enjoy The Man Who, but all other albums I've purchased have just been so-so, this one included."
2,12 Memories you'll want to forget,"Simply awful... no stand out tracks whatsoever, the ones that do stand out only do so because they are not as bad as the rest. I would say if you liked the Travis stuff of old you should check out a band called Lowgold, get 'Just Backward of Square' and they also have a new one out which i'm awaiting delivery on. Go to the UK site to check out the reviews."
3,Simply not that good,Mediocre. Many songs are overcomplicated and not catchy enough. others stay past their welcome. Re-offender is the big sell on this album. Buy it used.
1,"12 Memories, quickly forgotten!","This is the worst album by a band full of potential, yet unable to crack out of their shell! No way, is this better than their last album (which wasn't very good either). The only 2 good albums released by this band was their very first one ""Good Feeling"" and ""The Man Who,"" both are absolutely must hears. Especially the latter, for that is without a doubt one of the greatest British pop/alternative albums ever composed by any band! It was considered by many critics as the British album of the year, and the band gained some recognition. However, their failure to take their following album to greater heights killed their potential. But Fran is a great lyricist and the band still has some hope of breaking out. They just need to keep their heads up and go back to their original style, of their 2 first albums, and add another ingredient which was missing. One which will propel them to prominence--one in which is up to the band to discover."
3,Travis continues their way,"I wan't aware of this album coming out. I thought that they would take a break after recording The Invisible Band, after everything that happened. Being a fan of The Man Who and The Invisible Band, I had to check this out.The album starts with the light ""Quicksand"", a good opener. After seeing the live performance of ""Beautiful Occupation"" on the MTV Europe Music Awards in their hometown of Edinburgh, I fell in love with this song, followed by the absolute best track ""Re-Offender"". ""Somewhere Else"", ""Love Will Come Through"", ""Happy To Hang Around"" and the ender ""Walking Down The Hill/Some Sad Song"" make this album complete and worth while.It's not as good as The Invisible Band though, but a good Travis album which is easy to listen."
3,Average,"Sure this disc is deeper lyrically speaking..other than that it leaves little to the memory. After countless listens my 12 memories recall nothing that suggests a step in the direction of thier previous works or greatness. I hear people saying they are ""evolving""? Evolving into what? A forgettable sound.Sorry...Travis is awesome and perhaps LIVE can add some memories to this venture."
3,Actually about 1 or 2 memories,"2 1/2Nowhere near as memorable or effective as some of there better stuff, this mostly mechanical effort offers half baked pop concoctions, mostly of the annoying, catchy, pseudo-eclectic variety, as if any subtlety whatsoever has been lost on the band in favor of a straight and narrow, approach. While the band was never shy of talent for catchy songs, most of these 12 memories fade rather quick from underdevelopment. Thankfully we are seldom reminded of a more relaxed, assured band, a far cry from the tacky, lazy upbeat majority of this disc."
2,Couldn't make it three in a row :o(,"After 2 classics: ""The Man Who"" & ""The Invisible Band"", Travis have hit a creative snag on this one.. Only two songs stand out for me: ""Mid-life Krysis"" and ""Re-Offender"". The rest isn't horrible, it's just so-so.. Let's us hope the next one will be better."
3,Give it a few listens first....,"Is this album disappointing - of course. Why? Because everyone, myself included, expected this to be ""The Man Who"" part deux or ""Invisible Band"" II. Still it's not bad, it's definitely not great though.Upon second listen, it sounded much better than the initial ""Hmmm I don't know about this"" first time through.It does come off as preachy at times. It'll go from a political song then jump back to a love song - not consistent.There are some good songs and at times it sounds like the ""old"" Travis that lots of people love.It's definitely only for those existing Travis fans, as I don't think this album will really draw any new fans in - it will only exclude some of its existing fans.So overall it's middle of the road. Hopefully they'll bounce back on the next one because at times, on this disc, you can still here the wonderful potential of this band."
3,"They Can Cheer, They Can Mystify, They Cannot ROCK","""12 Memories"" is mediocre by comparison the their stellar 2 last albums ""The Invisible Band"" and ""The Man Who?"" While the others eminated spirit and passion for the music, this one sounds like uninspired Beatles B-sides. The lyrics are especially dark on this one, but the music just doesn't seem to add to the mood of what is being said. On ""Peace the **** Out"", they attempt a harder rock-and-roll sound which doesn't work at all for this band. Their talents are better suited for cheerful pop tunes and highly mental mood music like found on ""The Man Who."" I saw them in concert this week at the 9:30 Club in Washington DC. The reaction of the audience to tracks from the new album was stale. If they are wise, the will move back away from the path taken on this album."
3,Not great but not horrid.,"I don't know where my mind was when this CD was released so I was thrilled when I happened upon Travis' latest offering. After the first hearing, I wasn't highly impressed. I had hoped for more but I also realized that the album's tone was different and it seemed that the band was definitely trying to branch out.Overall, I enjoy the CD but much of it dissolves into background noise for me -- not enough of the tracks stick out as yet. I appreciate Travis' effort but I can't help but feel that this album needed more fine tuning before release.To put it plainly, it's good for relaxing while reading a book or working but don't expect any standout tracks that compare to ""Sing"" or ""Why Does It Always Rain on Me."""
2,Not that good.,"Travis's first album ""the man who"" had some creative, catchy songs and some of this was carried over to the next album ""invisible band"" (even though I thought it wasn't as good).However, I think this album is a big disappointment. The songs sound weak and uninspired. There are only a couple of ok songs worth listening too. After a few listens, I found myself skipping through most of it."
1,I agree with it is utter musical tripe,I think they lost their record contract after this or the next one but this def contributed. Please do not listen to the sycophants. Travis should have stayed out of politics during such a sensitive time for America and whether they want to admit it or not that this junk they called songs was the downfall of Travis.
3,Nicely Done,"After the first few listens, I have to admit that I was disappointed with ""12 Memories"". After ""The Man Who"" and ""Invisible Band"", I just felt that Travis could do so much better. They endured quite a setback with almost losing their drummer, and it just seemed like they were out to write a dejected ""Why does this always happen to me?"" record. Then it started to grow on me more upon repeated listens. My favorite tracks include ""How Many Hearts"", ""Happy to Hang Around"", and ""Walking Down the Hill"". Fran's voice is still quite enchanting, the band still has some clever songwriting left, and I am looking forward to their next release. ""12 Memories"" is a solid album, it's not their best, but for $...it's definitely a safe bet."
4,Tasty Tracks,"The new album by Travis, 12 Memories, is actually pretty good. It's miles better than the last album, The Man Who. Its got the spunk of their lesser-known first release, Good Feeling, with the melodic beauty of their biggest hit, The Invisible Band. I've only listened through it twice now, but I can tell it will remain in heavy rotation during my drive time."
5,STOP the WAR!!!,"Aunque son apoliticos se dejan escuchar, tocan temas mas sociales sin embargo no caen en la apologia. Un excelente album para el regreso de TRAVIS luego del accidente de Neil. Son ellos de nuevo, mas maduros, pero ellos!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed. I gave it several listens but it failed to impress. Not a single song that lives up to the Travis's name. I reallylike Travis, but this was a let down"
4,Melancholy but Nice,"I was surprised. Nice, thoughtful songs, I really enjoyed this album. If it were not for One Tree Hill, I never would have been exposed to this band. Now I want to find out more. Re-offender is my favorite.....then maybe Some Sad Song....A-"
4,Quite good,"This is the first Travis album i've bought, and i think it's pretty good. Good tracks, especially Beautiful Occupation, Love Will Come Through, Re-offender, Quicksand, Somewhere else, and overall its a album with substance.However, some songs, like paperclips, are like Coldplay's easy to please, which wear you down. Being a fan of both bands, i can tell Travis is borrowing some of Coldplay's beats and riffs, and also adding in some metal-esque choruses, which run very smoothly. However, it would be better if they were more original.Generally, its a good album worth buying. Enjoy!"
3,Slight Disappointment,"At first listen I was slightly disappointed with the new album. I have been looking forward to its release for a long time. I am a huge Travis fan but this album simply doesn't provoke the same inspiration and emotion that ""The Man Who"" and the genious ""Invisable Band"" do. It is good to hear Travis experimenting, but that is what we have Radiohead for."
2,SHUT THE F*** OUT,average really..their worst up till now... nothing compared to the man whobetter luck next time lads...but i doubt there ll be a next time..you re better off calling it a day and going solo...fran at least...(lol i m mean)
2,Snooooooooooooore,"Okay, so I like Travis. In the past, they've produced some beautiful Brit pop, laden with monstrous hooks, reaching their peak with the previous ""The Invisible Band."" ""12 Memories,"" however, lacks any stand-out tracks, and is so slow, sad, and hookless, that it's practically comatose. Every now and again, a snippet of a song, an intro, a chorus, or a bridge, may differentiate itself from the self-consciously morose mess, may even prove to be quite beautiful, but never does the rest of the song warrant a repeat. This makes for a very frustrating listen and an unfortunate record. If often joke with friends that I like boring music, but ""12 Memories"" may prove me wrong. Wake up, Travis."
3,Not Quite The Man Who,"I never thought I'd say this, but the latest from Travis is too British. Nevertheless, you've got to give Fran Healy credit for trying. His lyrics here are all over the map--literally. Some of the album is about love, some is about politics, and Healy wedges in both references to the United Nations and a crowd of soccer hooligans chanting ""Peace the f*** out."" There's nothing wrong with that, and there's nothing particularly wrong with this mostly charming little album, either. But it doesn't soar, and that means it suffers in comparison to The Man Who. Every time it approaches the cusp of brilliance, it backs away, right where Man Who would have taken flight. Still, this is an enjoyable record. It just doesn't grab and hold you the way we know Travis can."
3,definitely fills a void,"Its a crime that Deutekom made so few recordings. There are no dramatic coloraturas today that come anywhere near her talent level. Carreras in his prime was wonderful. Aside from the fact that my copy of this cd skips in several places, the sound is not that good. Its a live mono recording and it sounds like it was recorded from a broadcast. Surprisingly theres only one duet included."
5,Outstanding integrative work,"I am a physician by training and an emotional-social intelligence instructor to groups. This book is outstanding in integrating research insights from the diverse disciplines of psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and sociology. It highlights our increasing recognition of how the brain integrates our species for survival. I found myself inspired by the writing as well as the information. A great book with no ""fluffiness"" - this is for scientists and those wanting to be informed about how neuroscience is the underpinning of much of the human experience."
4,A new paradigm for relationships,"Louis Cozolino's work is a masterful blending of brain functioning and human relationships. His insights provide a new understanding of human relationships and how they are shaped through brain functioning. The new understanding has led to a reworking of what we assumed we knew about the brain and its functioning. Louis himself has commented that he is learning how much of what he had earlier been taught about the brain was wrong. His work makes the topic very understandable and entertaining. I was fascinated with his insights concerning human relationship that are emerging from the studies done on the brain. As a marriage and family therapist, I found the work well worth the read.Jeffrey Murrah ([...])"
4,Hollywood glamor at its best!,"If you're a ""Joan Crawford"" fan, then this is one movie,where she was at her best. She has great bone structure and looks fantastic at any angle in this film. The plot is dated and tame, but Joan and Clark are beautiful to look at."
4,Fine intro to a difficult subject,"Heidegger was an obfuscator of the first order. Still, he had much to say as well as much influence on academia today. He is therefore worth getting to know. Rather then wade through several hundred pages of the deliberately (imo) opaque text in Being and Time, as I mistakenly did, this would be a nice start.Truth is, Heidegger's ideas are not all that complex, it is his language that gives the appearence of difficult thought. Inwood clarifies but succeeds in avoiding over simplification. Still, I believe someone could do an even better job of presenting Heidegger's thought to the average reader.Definitely recommended over any of those cartoon books on Heidegger which are not only too simple, but extremely dishonest and innacurate."
4,Tai chi Principles,"If you are new to tai chi and you are looking for a general book on it, then it is the best buy you can do. It is short, simple, it explains the principles of the art and how to practice it. It does't describe any particular form. Very good quality."
1,Not what the editorial review says at all!!,"When you read the editorial review it says its for infants etc., but there is not one baby in this video! I think somebody made a mistake...so I am very disapointed even the customer review is talking about babies. So I hope you fix this error before some other mommy buys this and thinks she's getting a massage viedeo for her baby..."
2,Disappointing,"I just received this in the mail today and was pretty disappointed with it. The changing pad is VERY thin, too thin to use with an infant, in my opinion, and the pad itself is fairly small. On the other hand, the pouch bigger than I expected, which means that it would take up a fair amount of space in your diaper bag. I bought it for under $9, which means that it's not worth the money to ship it back, but I wish that I hadn't even spent that $9 on it. There are better products out there for this purpose. Buy the First Years Deluxe Fold & Go, which is the same price right now and has a better pad. Or, if you can afford it, buy the Skip Hop Pronto. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,perfect for quick trips,"I keep this little diaper bag in my car. Now that my son is almost 2 it's really all I need for day to day. No need to lug around the big, bulky diaper bag unless we're going on an overnight trip. I get lots of compliments and ""where did you get that"" from other moms."
1,Laughable ineptitude from a journalist and lawyer regarding the NRA's power,"Besides all the incorrect and alarmist-type rhetoric these two people spout out, it's just ""Business As Usual"" from the anti-gun lobby. Their arguments or [facts] are absolutely misinformed. Whenever you get a pair of incompetents trying to explain a subject or subjects they know very little of; you get a comic book style dissertation that only confirms to Americans that most journalists are liberal nuts, with no common sense."
1,Seriously?,I think I'll hold pencil manufacturers responsible for any bad grades I received in high school. Does anyone actually take these premises seriously?
1,A joke don't waste your money,This book is truly one of the worst I've read. Completely full of mis=leading half truths and out right lies. Take a past and save your money
5,High contrast,"I bought these tickets after attending several Toastmasters speech contests. I noticed that some of the raffle tickets had very busy patterns and low contrast printing (black letters on a brown background, puhlease). But these tickets are high-contrast and easy to read. Just the ticket when you want to keep your event running on time."
1,But he takes their money,"Mr. Regan criticizes his University employer for conducting experiments on animals, but continues under this employment andenjoys the economic gains afforded the University by thisexperimentation."
1,Terrible Picture,"I agree with a couple other reviews that this movie is not worth buying on Bluray. The movie itself was very interesting, but it is definitely not in High Definition. The company that put this out (I believe Warner Brothers) should be ashamed of themselves. I was watching on a 50"" plasma that every other bluray I have has looked unbelievable on, but not this one. Would not recommend buying this, unless buying regular version. I wish I new how to get my money back on it."
5,Fantastic!,"I have lost weight, im feeling more active, I take this in addition to my prescribed medication and its been fantastic! I would recommend this to anyone who has hypothyroidism! I only take it once a day, At the beginning I took it in the morning but I realized it caused issues with my prescription, so now i take it at night! I LOVE IT!"
1,Save your money,"This DVD is twenty minutes long but can be summed up in three words, cry it out. That is basically the method that this video ""teaches"" parents for getting their babies to sleep. Frankly I don't see why anyone needs to pay $30 and spend 20 minutes learning how to do that. Since I'm not keen on letting my little guy cry it out I was looking for something a little more progressive. The No Cry Sleep Solution is a great book, but since my husband isn't a reader and I want us to be on the same page I was hoping this DVD might be helpful. I was wrong, it wasn't. It was a waste of money. If you are looking for ideas other than cry it out, read The No Cry Sleep Solution."
5,Sensational but easy,"Linda McGehee is the queen of structured bags. Her instructions are well written and her patterns are easy and fun, while still making elegant bags. It's all about the fabric, and Linda's samples are gorgeous. They go from fun with frogs and embrodery to elegant and dressy. You can find inspiration in this book."
1,not good if you're used to practicing yoga,"i have been doing yoga for years and years and the one thing that has always been consistent, no matter where i went, was that you hold the poses for several breaths. in this video, i felt like the second i was in the pose, it was time to move on to the next one. you really need the time to breathe into a pose which shiva does not give you. plus, her pronounciation of exhale is totally annoying. i just got rocki's prenatal yoga and i love it. i alternate it with my fit mama dvd for varied benefits."
5,I had a wonderful birth!,"I used this DVD throughout all of my pregnancy and it was wonderful. It reall taught me to relax and breath. It also helped me stretch my body in ways that were healthy for me and my baby. I had a wonderful birth, naturally and without pain. I feel this DVD was responsible for much of my peaceful birthing experience."
1,Bust,I didn't like this DVD at all. I found it to be very boring and not calming or relaxing at all. It was very disappointing.
4,Great for exercise and very relaxing,This workout keeps me really relaxed and stretched out. My back has hurt the last few weeks and this video really helps!
3,"Pretty good, but slow","This video was recommended to me by a friend because it targets appropriate yoga practice in all three trimesters of pregnancy. I do like how the video smoothly shows you modified poses for various stages of pregnancy. Overall though, I think the workout is a bit too simple. Most poses are not repeated more than one time, so I don't feel the benefit that I normally do from a regular yoga class. I may start watching it with the remote close by so that I can pause and do each pose a couple extra times!"
4,Great DVD,"I love this DVD, it has yoga for all stages of pregnancy and isn't too painful. Definitely recommend it!"
4,very good,i love this prenatal yoga. i do shiva rea and anna getty's yoga alternate days. very refreshing!!!
2,Not a fan....,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. Not only is it not challenging at all, but I found Shiva to be annoying. (perhaps it's just the hormoes, lol) The way she pronounces the word ""exhale as ""ex-ale"" with no ""h"" drove me crazy and distracted me!I did the whole DVD and didn't feel like I worked out at all. If your in decent shape already, I'd skip this one unless you just want to stretch or breathe."
2,Not Worth It!,"I am in my first pregnancy and practiced some yoga prior to this. I was looking for a good DVD for stretching,relaxation,and strength. There were few good points about this program. The best one was each trimester is represented with modified poses. That was about it. The program did nothing that I was looking for and I will be looking for a new DVD."
1,Pre Natal Yoga,"I bought this yoga tape and followed it to the letter and followed its instruction to the letter, first off I'm not new to yoga and have been doing it on and off for years. however after doing the modified prose at 3 months I miscarried my child a 3 days later. I remember going back and listening to Shiva Rea in her interview and saying yoga is safe during pregnancy, I could not help but feel she was lying through her teeth she did not seem convinced of the argument she put forth. I'm a mother of 4 and had never exercised in any of my pregnancy and really should not have even bothered with this tape. I would caution pregnant women that their is a real danger with yoga during pregnancy and I'm also a former nurse so health for me was an important part of my pregnancy. I just feel this tape is not safe for everyone and certainly not while pregnant."
4,Good Video,"I really enjoyed this workout. It's quite a bit easier than going to the yoga studio, so it was perfect on those days when I felt worn down from work and being pregnant."
4,Great stretching routine,"I love this video...I used it with my first pregnancy and now with my 2nd as well. If you are used to working out it's not a tough workout by any means, but the stretches hit all the places you want them to stretch. It is relaxing and at the same time you could be a little sore the next day...you feel good afterwards."
4,Great option for those new to Yoga,"I had never done Yoga before using this tape 10 weeks into my second pregnancy. I had researched the benefits of pre-natal yoga and was hoping that this tape would provide a good start. I was not disappointed. I found the tape easy to understand and enjoyable through each trimester. As a woman who grew up working out through group sports, I was hesitant to try something ""new agey"" like Yoga. This tape was very down-to-earth and I plan on doing it throughout successive pregnancies. I have been void of back pain and had a smooth pregnancy with a good level of energy. I attribute this, in part, to Shiva Rea's video."
3,Not great but not terrible for the more experienced.,"I bought this VHS when I was 3 months pregnant along with 2 other prenatal aerobic VHS. I have not had alot of exposure to Yoga but wanted to give this one a go. And I must say, it is quite difficult if you've never done yoga before or if you don't quite have the strength and stamina. I have worked out occasionally so I am not new to doing routines but I found this one quite strenuous and difficult for beginners, not to mention beginners who were pregnant. For me, I just preferred the aerobics as it's livelier and similar to dancing but at a slower pace. However, if you've done yoga before this may be no trouble for you."
5,I feel SOOOOO much better!,"Oh wow I feel great after doing this video. I am out of shape, six months pregnant and was starting to feel extreme back pain. I never work out... After doing this workout, my backpain has substantially decreased. I can even feel the baby kick more.. I really think the baby loves the work out too!I had to work up to doing the full video as I am out of shape, but even 20 minutes of it made me feel wonderful! I would definitely recomend!"
5,great dvd for pregnancy,"I got this dvd in my third trimester, after reading reviews on amazon and other websiteand I am glad i bought itI started with doing yoga as per Shiva Rea's easy to follow instructions first thrice a weekthen once a week in my last trimesterwalking 15 minutes a day (except last trimester due to cold weather)were the only physical form of exercise i didThroughout my pregnancy I felt active, energetic and healthyand I had a wonderful normal delivery, the baby is healthy and so am I.I would recommend this to all pregnant women out there.god luck with your pregnancy and god bless you."
2,Just okay,"It's perfectly fine and safe to use during pregnancy. I'm a person who exercised 3-4 times a week prior to getting pregnant however and it was far too easy for an intermediate exercise enthusiast. I by no means am a ""power"" exerciser, but this seemed to not push me even in the slightest bit - maybe that's its intent - I was wishing for a little more."
2,Mind-numbing,"I love Shiva Rea, but this DVD is mind-numbingly slow. I practice yoga about once a week and have had the good fortune of feeling good through my pregnancy. Now at 39 weeks, I still find the DVD too slow and mellow to keep me interested. For anyone experiencing alot of discomfort in their pregnancy, this might be nice to stretch and relax, but anyone looking for a slight physical challenge will be disappointed."
3,A Bit Clumsy,"doing any type of yoga is a plus during pregnancy and i have always been a fan of shiva rea, but this tape disappointed me. in shiva's other tapes (audio and video) there is movement and flow.my problem with the tape is that props are overused, making creating a flow with the session virtually impossible. pulling up chairs, putting them back, etc., it's too much of a distraction."
4,great for relaxation,"I bought this when I was 5 months pregnant, and now I am 8 months. The setting and the music are wonderfully relaxing. It is easy to adjust your level of exercise as well, as each trimester is represented by a different woman - the 3rd trimester focusing more on chair work rather than standing (let's face it, some days you need to sit on a chair more than others anyway!)They use official yoga props but I use a roll of paper towels instead of the block, and stockings instead of the strap. I confess I haven't actually completed the last segment with the guided relaxation. It is a long tape and I find myself running out of time. Since tomorrow is my last day of work I will start to do the whole tape til the baby is born!I did find that some of the poses don't match the voiceover exactly, and they breath really slow and I find myself inhaling when they are exhaling sometimes.All in all worth the purchase!"
2,Very basic - for beginners only,"While the pace of the dvd was very relaxing and non-invasive, I found the moves to be superficial and basic at best. Having the third trimester mommy on a chair for the majority of the workout was kind of ridiculous in my opinion. There is no reason she could not have done those moves and it should have been offered as an extreme modification for those experiencing any difficulty in their pregnancy rather than 'this is what you should do in your 3rd trimester'. Just because you have a big belly, it does not instantly preclude you from being able to execute many yoga poses.I was much more impressed with the Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa - faster paced, much more challenging and you really felt like you got a significant workout/stretch!"
4,Great Yoga Video,"Being in a position in which I had to change my exisiting workout regime for the safety of my pregnancy, I skeptically took to heart the recommendations by friends and family to try prenatal yoga.Prenatal Yoga-Shiva Rea, was the choice for my first venture into yoga and I was surprisingly pleased with the way my body felt after the workout. The video offers one workout, but has three women in first, second and third trimester completing the exercises. This allows the viewer to make the necessary accomodations based on where they are in pregnancy.I wasn't interested in a video that focused on the spiritual essence of yoga. I was pleased in that regard as well. There is a meditative period at the end of the video, but it serves as the cool down and is important to complete to feel refreshed.All and all, I am pleased with my choice."
5,Great program,"I wanted a prenatal yoga program that was centering, relaxing and would help me feel good in my 2nd and 3rd tri. I have been practicing yoga for a few years and I didn't want a DVD that was too instructional but I wanted explinations on how to position my pregnant body differently. This DVD has just enough of explinations not but so much that after you have watched it a few times it get annoying. I have another penatal yoga DVD that I can't stand to watch because there is too much instruction over and over again. This DVD is great for beginners or the more experienced person. It gives you 3 options for modifications based on your belly and experience or flexibility."
4,Great video,"I didn't do much yoga before being pregnant to compare, but I am pleased with this video. It is a bit repetitive at times, but it helps me relax and I sleep much better after using the video."
4,Good mellow prenatal video,"This was just what I was looking for - a prenatal specific workout that I have been able to use throughout pregnancy no matter how I am feeling. I am at 39 weeks and am still using it and plan to use it as an aid during early labor. I feel relaxed, well stretched and less achy when I am done. I like that there are several modifications demonstrated. I much prefer this over Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms, which I also purchased, and Tantric Yoga for Blissful Pregnancy, which I rented from Netflix. When I want a more rigorous workout I apply modifications learned in this and other places to my Rodney Yee Power Yoga series (which I love). I feel I will continue to use this workout after pregnancy as well."
2,Wait til you 3rd Trimester!,So I am at the beginning of my 2nd trimester and love Shiva Rea but I was so board by this DVD. This would be good for someone very new to yoga or much further along in their pregnancy.
3,Beware: NO MASSAGE!!!,"This is a decent, gentle workout. It is not the most exciting, but is do-able, and does relax you. I had a VERY rough first trimester, and went from being active (1-2 hour workouts 4-5 times a week) to lying in bed moaning for a couple of months. I too found the extensive use of props a bit annoying (who in the world has a freakin' yoga blanket? & if you do, you are NOT going to dig this workout, as you are truly an aficionado. I used some old pillows instead). I find it best to do this at night, since it is sooo slow-paced it kinda puts me to sleep, as oppose to energizing me.This is a great way to gently stretch out tight muscles after a period of inactivity, but if you're looking for a workout, this is not it.I'm very disappointed that there was no massage section, as that was the feature that ultimately swayed me into buying this DVD! I kinda feel like I got bamboozled!! :-(Good luck to all of my fellow expectant mommies! I hope this helps..."
3,its ok,the dvd was reasonably priced (did not buy from amazon) and the yoga was fine if you can get past the instructor and music. very new agey. just not my personal style. others probably love it.
4,Good for mom and baby,"I am an exercise physiologist, and I find this video to be very good for both mom and baby. It is great when combined with other pregnancy exercises."
4,better than most prenatal DVDs,"I agree with an earlier reviewer who was annoyed at her pronounciation of exhale (""eggsale""), but other than that I rank this far higher than Zen Mama (ug!) or even the seemingly beloved FitMama's yoga portion. This is much more like real yoga classes I've taken, and I think that you DO hold the poses enough to get a workout, for sure. I'm in my 8th month and this is the video I reach for when my back or ribs are sore. I always feel better afterward, and usually sleep better too."
4,Started after 10 weeks of bedrest,"I was very happy when my doctor gave me the go ahead at 34 weeks to try this video. After being on bedrest for 10 weeks I was a little nervous. As a kinesiologist and former elite athlete, I was extremely satisfied with the 3rd trimester modifications. It has allowed me to ease back into exercising. I feel more confident that I will be able to withstand the strain of labour. The only downfall is sometimes I find they do not explain what muscles to contract (example the Kegel segment). I think it is because they might take it for granted that all women know how to do them."
4,Very Relaxing,"I wouldn't really consider this exercising, but it is very relaxing and offers a great stretch to stiff muscles. I love how the poses are broken into the three trimesters! It's also great that you don't have to do all the sessions at once - you can just hit ""next"" to do a few if you're short on time. Afterwards, I always feel really refreshed! I would definitely recommend it as an accompaniment to walking or another form of (pregnancy-approved) cardio, but on its own you won't get much aerobic benefit."
2,Lame,"I find this yoga routine slow, dull and unchallenging - and I am not in the greatest shape! The use of props is unnecessary and tedious; the music is lousy; and it just about felt like a waste of time to me. Yoga Mama - while also under-challenging - is much better, and includes some great poses."
2,YAWN. Slow moving and easy.,"I like yoga as a way to stretch and feel invigorated. I don't like yoga that's sappy (""imagine your baby is enjoying this practice as much as you are"") or too slow. I really didn't like this dvd.It's just... easy. I'm sure this is fine for ladies coming to yoga for their first time, but as someone who's pretty active, this practice just didn't challenge me at all. I also found the inward-looking sappy new age stuff got old fast. The one strong point, though, was that it does demonstrate three separate ways to do the poses, so less flexible people could look at the 3rd trimester version for help. But I'm in my 3rd tri and had no trouble doing almost all of it with the 1st trimester version. It's just that easy.A great alternative that I later purchased and LOVE is theComplete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD Set. It's the exact opposite- fast moving, keeps your attention."
2,no thanks,i did not like this dvd. it moved far too quickly through the posses for me to get anything out of them and required too much work for the modified posses. i was having to constantly move the chair. i also didnt know when purchasing the dvd that i needed props for it. i do not recommend this product.
2,"Slow, easy ""workout""",They really have geared this video toward those in the third trimester. It is not challenging at all for women in earlier stages of pregnancy. If you are looking for a workout this is not the video for you.
2,Perhaps ok if you've never done yoga,"This DVD seems to be designed for those new to yoga. If you are experienced with yoga and/or are looking for any sort of a workout, I'd find something else."
1,One star is too high of a rating for this junk!,"I am puzzled by all the good reviews on this DVD; I would have given it zero stars if the option was available. It was really slow and boring, basically a very gentle stretching routine. I did not like the instructor either. She is just very bland, lacks personality and OMG the voice - I guess she was going for the calm and soothing tone, but to me it sounded just fake and borderline creepy. I highly recommend Cathy Louise Broda's Pregnancy Yoga: A Practice for Each Trimester instead."
2,Buy ZenMama instead,"I really disliked this video and it was a waste of my money. I tried it a few times but it did not flow well and often times felt uncomfortable. I am a regular exerciser, so it's not that I am out of shape, it is the poses and they routine. I also did not enjoy Shiva Rhea. She was pretty bland. On the other hand, I bought ZenMama and use it all the time. I would buy that instead."
1,GAIAM DVD'S LACK LUSTER FOR MOMMIES,"These Gaiam DVD are all the same: boring and uninspiring. Try the Crunch Mama which has better content and pacing. I'm 21 weeks and bought all the Pre-natal tapes and DVDs I could find including Gurmuhks, Kathy Smith's and Gaiams. By far Crunch is the best produced and straight forward."
5,Great for pregnancy aches and pains - also easy labor,"In my first pregnancy I was afflicted by hyperemesis (severe nausea and vomiting)throughout the entire pregnancy and so my normal higher intensity workout routine was out of the question. I started this video around 17 weeks and it really helped my aches and pains.I was in labor for only a few hours and the labor and delivery nurse commented that I seemed to be having a pretty easy time with the labor and what had I been doing? I said this yoga video (plus swimming). Hard to say if that is what made the labor relatively easy but I am now in my second pregnancy, same sickness, and just started the video at 17 weeks. It made a lot of difference to me but my goals are not to prevent weight gain with this video."
2,"Very Mother Earth, movements are too fast","My husband got me this DVD for Christmas t and I tried it for the first time the other day at 17.5 weeks. Firstly, the woman is highly annoying. The first part is some hippie, pregnancy is wonderful and magical and blah blah blah. So I just fast forwarded through that part. After getting into it a bit, all the moves are okay but she goes through them like she's trying to get it done with so she can go off to the rest of her evening. This video should easily be 2 hours long, but it feels soooooo rushed. And lastly she for some reason says ""exale"" instead of ""exhale"" which gets fairly distracting.I may use this after 36 weeks but I can't see using it again before then. I'll be looking for a new yoga DVD for the time being."
4,Nice workout,"This is a great video for a very light workout. It is a lot of streching and relaxation for mother and baby. I believe it will help prepare for birth; if you are looking for a low key exercise, this is it!"
5,Love this DVD,"I feel amazing after doing these stretchesI am now 6 months along and every time i have any back pain i just do the video (or only some of the poses) and i instantly feel better. Its a life saver. They modify the poses to suit any trimester too, which is really nice. I would recommend this to any expecting mother especially if you experience back pain/discomfort. I didnt find it too hard either and she always makes sure to tell you to take it easy and only stretch until it doesnt feel good any more...not the case in a regular yoga class!"
5,"Helpful poses, good flow to routine","I have been using this video since the beginning of my pregnancy and I am now almost 6 months along. I find that I appreciate it more as time goes on, because many of the poses help alleviate lower back pain I have from the changes in my body, and I can tell I feel stronger as my body keeps getting bigger. The background music is nice, the instructor's tone is pleasant, and the routine as a whole has a nice flow to it."
3,Not for beginers!,"If you have never done yoga before try something else. I had never done yoga before and thought this would be a good place to start. I started a few weeks before I actually was pregnant and I could barely get through the first half. I had no idea yoga was so hard. By the third-trimester though I was really into it. It helped so much for my lower back pain. I've had lower back pain for a few years, then was in an accident in 2006, then another one when I was about 8 weeks pregnant. I really feel like this saved me during my pregnancy once I got the hang of it. My son is now 2months old and I still do this from time to time when I want something more relaxing than my cardio and weights."
3,Not very challenging,"I got this DVD for x-mas when I was 10 weeks pregnant. I'm now at 34 weeks and I've done it a couple different times during my pregnancy, but its just not that challenging. I never break a sweat or get my heart rate up. It does help to stretch out sore muscles, but if you expect an actual workout like traditional yoga, this is not the right DVD. I gave up on it and have been going to a pre-natal yoga center nearby that has been much more beneficial."
4,Nice at home yoga...,"I live in an area without at lot of prenatal yoga classes and wanted something I could do at home. I would recommend this gentle yoga for any pregnant woman who needs that extra stretch (isn't that all of us??) and those who are having back pain during pregnancy.The only reason that I didn't rate it a five is that it's a little slow for those of us who already know the basic yoga postures. I'm no yogi, but I've been doing yoga on and off for years and although it wasn't strength workout, it was a nice mellow practice."
3,Good exercises for pregnancy,"Good exercises with 3 different sessions. But I don't feel relaxed enough at the end and there is one exercise that I didn't understand (the ""4 stages building"")..."
1,"unnerving setting, not relaxing at all","i thought this might be a good relaxation type workout as advertised, but the instructor was so unnerving to me that i could not settle down and get into it....the whole experience was bad for me, as i tried to do this tape 4 times, and each time i felt like i was lost, the moves were like those in my yoga classes, but the teacher bugged me and i felt stressed watching her do stuff without seeing her mouth moved, i can't stand this video"
1,Did not like it,Did not like the piece I could see of this video. It did not include the massage section that was mentioned. & the video came scratched
1,Not really for beginners...,"Someone loaned this dvd to me about half way through my first pregnancy and the first time I tried it, I injured myself. I thought I was being careful and modifying things when I needed to, but alas. I had bursitis in my hip for about the next 6-8 weeks and was in a lot of pain and saw a chiropractor weekly. It finally went away, but this really turned me off to prenatal yoga. I'm about 5 weeks into my second pregnancy and am in a little better shape this time around. Going to try out the 10 Minute Solution Prenatal Pilates... we'll see how it goes."
3,good as i expected...,"this vhs tape is as good as i expected. It works, and it is what it was advertised to be! i love this yoga video."
2,Too Hard and Annoying,"I've been doing Yoga and Pilates for years (well before I was pregnant) but I found this workout kept changing from sitting to standing to laying to using a chair and that wore me out before the workout really got going. I've used other work outs where you spend time on the floor doing the appropiate exercises, then a chair or blocks, then standing, etc. But not consently switching back and forth. I also have a Pilates video by someone else and it is much more taylored to pregnant woman. I thought that this one expected too much and easily wore me out. I thought the way the instructor talked was very annoying. It did not make me relax but irratated me."
1,"terrible audio, instructor is HORRIBLE","this is a terrible prenatal video, period. i cannot stand the voice of the instructor, she sounded sooo fake. and the audio, why did she have to do a voice over, it made moves feel uncomfortable and out of sync. i thought this would be better, considering some of the good reviews, but i thought it was horrible."
2,disappointed,"im currently 24 wks pregnant w/ my 3rd child & i was so excited when i ordered this DVD that i even payed for 2 day shipping. when i got the DVD i did my 1st workout that night. and while im sure that the workout would greatly benefit me if i kept up w/ it, i just cant bring myself to. Shiva Rea's voice bothers me to no end. she is obviously very well informed, practiced, & knowledgable in yoga, but she just sounds so flakey and spacey. i cant get past it. and the the time spent devoted to kegal exercises is a bit excessive, how many women could possibly need that much help in doing kegals?? the organization on the DVD is great and the massage section is awesome and very cool, but that voice and tone has got to go. the background music is very ""new age"" also, while some people might like that i certainly am not 1 of them."
1,"FitMama is so much better for you, overall this is not good","I would highly suggest you try Leisa Hart's FITMAMA video, it is so much better than this, you would be much better off working out with a certified fitness expert like Leisa who knows how to train people before, during and after pregnancy."
1,"terrible production, bad voiceover, not for new yoggies","this could be the most overrated video I have ever tried. THe instructor attempts to give a voice over to her routine(WHY? could she not talk and do the workout at the same time? that is such BAD!). The music and the voiceover was pathetic! THe only way anyone could enjoythis is if they have a supreme knowledge of yoga, and that still would not be enough. I thought this was the most overrated, most pathetic video for prenatal women. It was not effective for me, and the other 6 women I work out with. They all hated it as well...don't bother with this, try something more mainstream, your new baby will appreciate it!"
2,annoying,"typical southern california yoga space lady teaching this video, i would rather she talk to camera instead of doing a weird voice over; anyone in the tv/production knows that this is done only by unconfident tv pitchpersons, and shiva is a bit strange. I didn't enjoy this video enough to give if three stars, two is being nice."
3,No massage section,I rented this DVD on netflix prior to buying it. I was looking forward to the massage section which was present on the netflix version I rented. This version DOES NOT HAVE the partner massage section.
4,"Nice, relaxing stretching",A friend of mine loaned me this video and I just tried it out. I'm 13 weeks along so was able to do the first/second trimester poses. It's really a nice video. Shiva Rea's voice is soothing and relaxing. The video is calm and the movements flow into one another. All you need is a chair (any chair will do) to support you and you're on your way to making your body a better place for your baby and for its birth.
2,not good for this pregnant woman,"I did yoga during my last pregnancy, it really helped with stretching and ""making room"" for the baby so that I had a fantastic pregnancy and birth. This DVD makes me dizzy, cramped and bored. It definitely does not allow for stretching properly. No muscle building, or anything. Breathing was okay, and so was relaxation at the end."
3,Prenatal Yoga DVD,"This DVD would be good for beginners. If you've practiced yoga for a while you may want to look into another DVD. I found it rather strange that she uses a chair and didn't use a yoga mat. When comparing the workout to the one I receive at a yoga studio, it was good, but it probably didn't be modified as much as it was for the 2nd and 3rd trimester."
5,"Finally, a Decent Prenatal Yoga DVD","This is the 4th prenatal yoga I have purchased. I have not been very happy with the first 3 and I am glad to have landed on this one. I used to do intermediate yoga before becoming pregnant and I am used to a more challenging workout. This DVD met my needs. Of course, the intensity is not as high as it used to be but compared to the other 3 DVDs I bought, this is the best one. And the cheapest one too!"
3,Too Slow and Too Gentle -- But Good for First Time Yogis,"If you have regularly exercised and are at least proficient at beginning level yoga, this is not the DVD for you. The practice is painfully slow paced and watered down. A chair is heavily relied on as a prop in this DVD but unnecessary if you have any sense of balance or are not heavily pregnant.If you aren't new to stretching or to yoga, you may want to tryPrenatal Vinyasa Yoga ~ Jennifer WolfeorPrenatal Vinyasa Yoga ~ Short Forms with Jennifer Wolfe.If you are a total beginner wanting to start practicing yoga during pregnancy, then you should enjoy this DVD. Shiva Rea does have a wonderfully soothing voice. She represents the first trimester during the yoga practice. She is accompanied a woman in her second trimester and a woman in her third trimester who show the modifications.The yoga practice is broken up onto several segment that can be done together or separately. There is the beginning warm-up, standing postures, and seated postures."
2,Not very good,"If you have taken yoga in the past, or have a decent level of fitness, this dvd is pretty basic. I am only in the second trimester ans ended up doing the regular poses from my classes (regular practice) so I could actually feel like I was working a bit. Pretty disappointed as this item was highly recommended."
4,Great for loosening tight muscles,"Warning: this is not a workout. Do not expect to ""stay in shape"" using Prenatal Yoga.However, I would still recommend this DVD for mommies to be. At month 6, I find my shoulders are often tight and I have pains in my lower back. The poses in this DVD are great for stretching tight muscles and loosening achy joints - like knees and hips. Another plus is that the instructor provides three different levels of difficulty, so that you can maintain your practice throughout your entire pregnancy.Overall a safe and enjoyable tension release."
3,Good purchase at the right price,The DVD was shorter than I thought it would be but it is a good basic yoga workout :) The pace was a little fast for me. Just make sure you have all your materials ready when you start.
2,love shiva hate this dvd,Love her other videos but this was lame and only 15 minutes long. Meant to return it and have it in an box in my car. Waste of money.
4,"Great DVD, exercises a bit easy","I wanted to take pre-natal yoga classes, but those were too expensive, so I end up buying this DVD. I think of it more as a good relaxation/stretching dvd than exercise one. May be I will enjoy it more at later stage of the pregnancy, but for now it is not challenging at all."
2,Would not recommend - very disappointed,"I have been doing yoga for years and I was excited about trying this DVD to do yoga at home before I went back to the studio where I regularly practice yoga (and to supplement my practice). I was very disappointed, however. 2 main reasons: 1) Not enough time is spent/focused on breathing (one of the main tenets of yoga); I definitely thought she moved through the poses too fast and 2) In a related vein, the DVD was narrated in ""voice-over"" format so the instructions were not coordinated well with the poses. If you engage in other types of more intensive physical activity and want a less intense ""workout"" during pregnancy, this DVD may be for you. If you are someone who regularly (and mostly) practices yoga as your main form of physical activity, however, you may be disappointed."
3,Gentle stretches but not a rigorous yoga experience,"I have another Shiva Rea DVD which I use fairly frequently so after I got pregnant I thought I would purchase this in hopes it would include some modifications that I needed to be aware of without sacrificing the intensity.But honestly, I find the whole DVD a little silly. First of all, she sounds stoned in the intro section (which gives my husband a good laugh, as well as the extended (no pun intended) kegel strengthening section). The other yogis are dressed in brightly colored unitards and I keep getting distracted by how much Poppy (third trimester) resembles Winnie-the-Pooh. (And whose idea was it to put a second trimester woman in a grape colored body suit?)There's just not enough here to keep anyone other than a very beginner interested or inspired. However it feels safe and fairly relaxing so it might be something you use as a back up (or to keep those uterine walls strong strong strong)!"
3,Ok yoga workout. Good for beginners and those in third trimester,"I worked out on a very regular basis before becoming pregnant. Yoga was one of my favorite workouts. As I got further along in my pregnancy I began searching for prenatal workout videos. After reading reviews on Amazon I purchased this DVD. I found it to be almost too easy in my first and second trimesters. Now that I am in my third trimester and my belly is larger I am enjoying the pace of the video more. It is very slow. Even though I am in my third trimester I still follow the second trimester adaptions. The third trimester adaptions seem too easy. I also wish the video was a tad bit shorter. It is almost an hour long and I perfer 30minute workouts. Since it is broken up in different sections you can do just certain parts of the workout. Easy workout that I think will be great for beginners or those who want a slow paced yoga workout, not for those who want a challenging workout video that will make you sweat."
3,Almost Too Gentle,"I purchased 2 prenatal yoga DVD's this one andComplete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD Set. Here is my comparison:Shiva Rae Prenatal Yoga: I like that it has 3 women, one for each trimester but I honestly can't imagine ever needing to modify as much as the third trimester woman does (she uses a chair in some cases) I use this DVD on days when I want a VERY gentle practice which is not that often.Complete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga by Jennifer Wolfe: I have found that I use this DVD almost every day since it also has 3 models, one for each trimester and it has 15, 30, 45 and 75 minute routines plus labor poses and a partner section (which my partner actually does with me!). I love this DVD. The best part is that Jennifer is a doula and childbirth professional so I feel really safe while maintaining my strength and flexibility. This is like a regular vinyasa class, just modified for pregnancy."
2,not as good as expected,"This DVD disappointed me for several reasons. I am an experienced yogini in good shape and a big fan of Shiva's Yoga Sanctuary CD. She is a great teacher in many ways. However, these poses were too easy, focused on gentle stretching, not heart rate raising at all. Without heart rate raising, it's hard to warm up. The stretches moved too quickly from one to the next, so just when I get into the stretch, it moves on. Also, I find in my third trimester, I still do the adaptations for 1st or 2nd trimester because I am not new to yoga, am open, and strong. Basically, this DVD brings peace to the mind, a little stretching, no exercise, good chest/side opening, and a feeling that after it's done I need to go back and stretch my hips and legs more deeply. I wish there were more prenatal yoga classes and videos geared toward people who already have established yoga practices, rather than beginners, which is what this video seems to be."
4,Relaxing Yoga for Pregnancy,"I ordered this DVD along with another prenatal yoga video (Jennifer Wolfe), and find that this one is less challenging as a workout than the other. It is very well done, though. She is a very thorough instructor, and definately is well focused and educated on the needs of pregnant students. While this may not be the equivalent of a yoga fitness class, I feel that it is excellent for relaxing stretching and muscle toning throughout pregnancy. I would probably recommend it more to those in their late 2nd and 3rd trimesters, or those that have never done yoga before."
4,Good stretching and flexible options for all nine months,"I have used other Shiva Rea CDs, so I expected this to be more challenging than it actually is. However, it does offer good stretching that feels good and complements my other excercise. I like the option of doing the full 50 minutes or choosing shorter pieces of that, and the demonstrations of the three women that represent each trimester make it very easy to follow appropriate modifications. I'm just entering my third trimester, and I think I will find it particularly valuable in my last few months."
3,ok. It depends...,"The usefulness of this tape depends on what you're looking for. If you haven't been exercising a lot before pregnancy, this is likely suitable. You'll certainly get a good amount of toning and relaxing-stretching that will make you feel pretty good.Unlike some reviewers,I didn't mind the fact that the tape uses voice-over, but i found the instructor to be a little too ""relaxed"" for my taste --that is, she doesn't convey enough energy to get me going. I was a regular exerciser before I got pregnant (pilates and running) and so, I found this tape to not really be enough. If you have time to exercise 2 hours a day, you might combine it with a brisk walk or light run to get a more satisfying workout. But, if you're like me, an hour max is all you can spare. Actually, I haven't touched this tape since getting Leisa Hart's ""FitMama"". The latter includes yoga along with some fun salsa-dance aerobics, as well as kegels and stretching--it just feels like a more complete, efficient workout."
1,For the yoga expert who happens to be pregnant,"I picked up this DVD for my partner who is carrying our child. She had not done yoga before, and told me she really couldn't follow it. I (who have done some yoga, not an expert by any means) couldn't follow it either. The poses are just called out by name, which was useless to my partner. The constant voice over, made breathing correctly with the postures very difficult, and the voice over doesn't match up with the action.On a trivial note, we kept just cracking up. The 3 women's have odd names, and the voice over is like a mock yoga instructors voice (""You are getting very sleepy"")."
3,makes me dizzy,"I started using this dvd in my first trimester, and at that point, I enjoyed it. It wasn't really a workout, but was nice for stretching and waking up in the morning. Now I'm in my second trimester, getting a belly, and I'm already having trouble doing the routine. Even with the modified poses! Anything that invovles bending over makes me dizzy and faint. I don't think I'll be able to continue it into my third trimester."
4,Great during pregnancy!,"I used this dvd during my first pregnancy and am using it again now for my second pregnancy! I highly recommend it. The moves really helped ease my back and shoulder pain. I always feel very relaxed after doing yoga. The positions are clearly explained throughout the dvd. It's nice that they have a person in each trimester that you can follow as you do the moves. The only complaint I have is that it's a little long. I wish they had a shorter 20-30 minute ""extra"" session that I could do on nights when I don't have a whole hour to commit to exercise."
3,"Average, at best","This video is not for the woman who has never done yoga before. It jumps from one thing to the next so quickly, I had to watch the tape about five times and memorize the routine so that I was not left behind.Once I hit my third trimester. The routine did nothing for me. I'm not sure if I recommend this video or not."
2,Prenatal Yoga,Boring! I'm pregnant...not ninety! I found this dvd to be slow and unmotivating. I never even finished watching it.
2,Poory organized and way too easy!,"I haven't been doing yoga for years. But I am in pretty good shape. This video is neither challenging (strength) nor satisfying (stretch). In fact, it's a bit boring. It's also poorly organized with no ""flow"" between movements. If you want a prenatal yoga video that is actually challenging but still completely safe, try Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga with Jennifer Wolfe. She offers three workouts, 15, 30 and 45 minutes long. All workouts are modified for the three trimesters. It's an enjoyable workout as apposed to this video which is complete drudgery..."
3,An OK workout,"It's overall a nice video, but not much of a workout. There are some relaxing stretches and a decent combination of exercises. The yoga level is quite basic. I don't get a full stretch out of it, and certainly don't break a sweat. It does get a bit slow and boring and I often want to do the full yoga position instead of their modified version."
5,Great video,I love this video. I do it almost daily throughout my entire pregnancy. I was able to adapt to the modifications as needed as my pregnancy progressed. Its easy to follow and I feel great and relaxed afterwards.
3,"great for stretching, fails as a workout, too much talking","This is a great DVD to help with flexibility. However, it is NOT a good workout. This will not help stop excess weight gain. In addition, I find it annoying that she talks through the entire routine. I have another yoga DVD also put out by Gaiam, and they speak very little. I was hoping this one would be similar. It is especially annoying when she is not even talking about the specifics of the poses, but rambling about connecting to your unborn baby, etc."
4,Not too new-agey,"I am 8 weeks pregnant and bought this yesterday. I haven't actually done it yet, but I watched it to find out what kind of props I would need for it because I've never done yoga before. It doesn't seem too new-agey. There doesn't seem to be a lot of filler talk, which I really like. She does say, ""Pretend your baby is enjoying this yoga session as well,"" but it's something you can just ignore. I like how it clearly shows the modifications for each trimester and the directions are very clear. Like I said, I've never done yoga before and this looks like it's simple enough for me to do. For those who say that it doesn't flow very well together, I think they're crazy. All of the poses seem to flow well to me. I'm looking forward to doing this throughout my pregnancy."
2,Boring,It is nice that they have women in 3 different stages of pregnancy showing modifications for the poses BUT... It is so incredibly BORING. I couldn't wait for it to be over.
3,"Good stretch, not a workout","I found this DVD to provide a good stretch. It was slow and boring, though, and not at all a workout. I couldn't even do the whole thing without a break, because I was too bored. I found Shiva Rea's omission of the ""h"" in exhale annoying, as someone else here mentioned. The 3 different options for modifications was helpful, though for several of the poses, the woman in her 3rd trimester didn't seem to be doing much at all, it was so modified. I'm in my 3rd trimester, but followed the woman in her 2nd with no problems. If you want something really mellow to stretch and relax, this is a good choice. If you really want to exercise and maintain muscle tone during your pregnancy, look elsewhere."
3,Have to watch it with the sound off.,"Con: Shiva Rea's voice grates on me. It's so annoying that I follow the video with the sound off, listening to music instead. Learn how to say ""exhale,"" Shiva. The 148th time she said EX-SALE, I just about lost it. Also, there's an ""L"" in ""clockwise.""Pro: I like the 3 options to follow depending on which trimester you're in."
5,Loved It!,This product was perfect for me in my pregnancy. I included Yoga as part of my regular workout before pregnancy and this helped me continue. The instructions are clear and I loved having a guide for each trimester. It helps with form and to make sure you are not pushing yourself too far. I would suggest this as a great gift for any expectant mother.
2,A lot of s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g,"I'll keep this review simple since there are already so many reviews for this DVD: 1) Most poses consist of a lot of stretching, which were not satisfying. 2) The entire dvd is very long, almost an hour. After following this video once, I never want to do it again."
2,Great for insomnia,"I know yoga is supposed to be a relaxing exercise, but this just put me straight to sleep. I'm 5 1/2 months pregnant and Ive managed to get through the video twice, both times waking up 15 minutes or so after finishing the video. Also the narrator says ""Exale"" (instead of pronouncing the whole word ""EXHALE"". Didn't think it would be a big deal as other reviews mentioned this, but it is quite distracting. I would not recommend this video."
3,deceptive marketing,This product was marketed to be translated in Spanish but the language option was not in reality available on the DVD.
4,Excellent prenatal workout,"This is a great video - each of the three women in the video show the modification of the pose appropriate for each trimester. The workout is invigorating, but not strenuous. Also, while this is modified for pregnancy, it's still ""true yoga"", rather than a lot of the ""yogalates or yogaeorobics"" blends on the market. Another excellent Gaiam product."
5,A complete workout for strengthening your body,"One of the excellent yoga video I have come across!! It's a complete body workout in combination with any cardio exercise during pregnancy. The best part is -- like every exercise, one needs motivation to continue, this one surely gives lot motivation. You can immediately feel how good your body feels after each session."
3,So-So Yoga,I liked that the poses could be easily followed as each trimester had a color coded leotard to follow... other than that I wasn't impressed. I thought that the poses were definately useful but the instructor goes much to fast to really get benefit from the movements. Her constant talking also made it difficult to concentrate on my breathing. Overall I thought the instructor was annoying and the workout was ok.
5,Excellent!,I am 7 months pregnant and I really enjoy the relaxing yoga and a chance to strengthen and stretch my muscles and prepare for the labor and delivery of my child. I would recommend this DVD to anyone!
2,um..,"My wife watched this once- and hasn't put it into the DVD player again.I'm not sure why, but she'll do yoga every other night, and stretch the others- but wasn't very impressed with this DVD.Possibly because she already had been doing yoga for a while, and was comfortable doing it on her own without the walkthrough- so this may be a nice DVD for beginners.I personally thought it was very neat how they showed three different examples of how to do the moves, each for a different stage of pregnancy-"
5,Wonderful pre-natal DVD,"I was already a fan of Shiva Rea when I got pregnant and bought this video. I can see how some people might think her manner of speaking sounds ""fake"" but I can assure you, that is pretty much the way she is and it is genuine.Despite being a regular yoga practioner, I was surprised how quickly my body went from being OK with my regular (fairly vigorous) yoga practice to needing a more gentle one. I liked that it wasn't too long (50 minutes) and appreciated the modifications for different stages of pregancy."
2,Ok yoga DVD,"I practiced yoga before becoming pregnant, and was hoping to continue my yoga practice, getting the benefits of relaxation and strengthening. This DVD does provide both relaxation and strengthening. However, I found it to be best for beginners. The instructor moves very slowly which can be frustrating at times. The DVD is also very long, so those of you who are still working may find it difficult to squeeze this workout in. It is possible to stop at any point, but then it feels like you are missing something from your workout. This DVD is helpful with relaxation, but I have not felt the benefits of gaining strength and toning as I have in some other DVD's (which is also an important part of having a healthy and easy pregnancy!). I would recommend this video for a beginner who has lots of time on their hands!"
3,Title menu needs to be sectioned out,"Great instructor and good yoga video except the part that it doesn't have a sectioned out TITLE MENU!Every time I want to watch the later portion of video, I have to forward it to get there.If the DVD sectioned out in different chapter, it would be a nicer and easier Yoga DVD to use on daily base."
4,Good DVD for relaxing stretches,"Like that there are models to follow for each trimester. Directions are easy to follow and well-paced. Since I'd been taking yoga classes for more than several years, I think I would have wanted something more rigorous and energetic in my 1st and 2nd trimesters, but the relaxing and gentle pace is nice for the 3rd trimester - I'd say this DVD is more about stretching poses vs. flow sequences."
2,too easy,"This workout dvd would be good for your last month of pregnancy, but is too easy for trimesters one and two. I am now back online ordering a different, more challenging dvd. I wanted to feel like I got a bit of a workout, but this dvd focuses more on postiioning and breathing."
3,"Nice for stretching, not really a good yoga workout",I have enjoyed yoga for years and took a prenatal class with my first child. This video is far too easy for anyone comfortable with yoga poses. It is relaxing and easy for beginners and can provide nice stretches for those who don't exercise much or are just getting started in a routine.
3,"This is a video, not a DVD...","What I mean is, all they did was take the videotape and record it onto a DVD. There's no DVD menu or chapter selections, so you have to sit there and fast forward through the introduction or to get to whichever part of the exercise routine you want to do. I suppose this isn't a humungous deal, but if I had a choice between this DVD and one that DID have menu and chapter selections, I'd opt for the latter.As for the CONTENT of the DVD, I guess it's okay. I've done the routine twice and am already a bit bored with it, and I find the narrator's voice telling me to ""imagine your baby is enjoying the rocking motion,"" etc. a little annoying. I also agree with what another reviewer said: the modifications for third trimester are way too easy. I'm at 29 weeks and I did the first trimester exercises right off the bat."
2,Too easy,"I have gone to yoga classes off and on for the past few years and have always enjoyed it and considered it a good work out as well. Now that I am pregnant (15 weeks) I was excited to try the prenatal yoga. I was very disappointed when I tried this video. The instruction is slow and very easy. I also found the props required cumbersome and unnecessary. I will try it again when I get further along and see if it is more beneficial as one reviewer suggested. I would not recommend this video to anyone who is early in pregnancy, familiar with yoga and looking for a good workout."
2,Not my cup of tea.,I generally don't enjoy yoga but bought some dvd's for pregancy so I could retain my flexibility and build my stamina.I didn't make it all the way thru this yoga video. This dvd was just too boring for me to continue but I can't pinpoint what exactly about it I didn't like about it. One good thing is that the one workout does cover each trimester of pregnancy. There are modified yoga poses for the second and third trimester which is nice.
3,prenatal yoga,It was nice to do yoga at home during my prgenancy and the videos covers recommendatiosn for various times in the pregnancy
1,find another video,"this video lacks many things-consistency, meditation, and comfort. the poses are not held for a long enough period of time-unless you breathe at half the pace of most people. the final relaxation consists mostly of the music with the credits-nothing guided about that! shiva rea is so impersonal it is hard to believe she is a mother herself."
1,why does this instructor not talk to camera,"the audio on this video drives me crazy, i tried this video three times and have now donated it to my library. I would recommend Leisa Hart's FitMama video, it's not Yoga, but it's so much better for you than this womans weird video."
1,voiceover of instructors voice is so ANNOYING,"I find this video to be totally ANNOYING...how can an instroctor do a video and not be able to talk to camera? That is so unprofessional, it makes an otherwise ok or decent workout deemed TERRIBLE by me...i traded this video away ASAP and bet many others will to. This is not a good prenatal video."
5,excellent yoga dvd,"I bought this DVD while I was pregnant with my first child. I occassionally have lower back problems and this DVD was fantastic. It has modifications for each trimester and I'm so glad I bought it. I was so happy with it I decided to buy Shiva Rea's post natal yoga as well. Also, it's not just great for pregnant women...when my back bothers me now, this is still my favorite yoga DVD to work out all the kinks."
4,Good DVD for Mamas to Be!!!,"This DVD is good for all stages of pregnancy. Its easy to follow, very helpful & inexpensive. Good Buy!!!!"
2,"Good for stretching, not to get a workout.","I've been to yoga classes where you get more of a workout than this one. This is more like a stretching exercise. My complaint is a lot of the stretches seemed to repeat many times. The equipment required for use to follow the exercise like the block, straps are kinda specialised items you'd have to buy. I tried to substitue with items I can find at home like a step stool, and rope.For a real workout, I prefer the Perfect Pregnancy workout dvd with Karyne Steben."
4,So relaxing!!,This video will make you feel so good. The exercises looks like nothing at first but the way you feel after is amazing. In my first trimester I was very low energy and doing that video woke my all body up.
5,Very flexible for any trimester,"I bought this video as part of a shower present for a good friend, early in her 2nd trimester. Now, she is well into her third and still using the video regularly. She told me that she is really pleased with the program, because it demonstrates every position with a woman from each trimester - modifying the exercises appropriately to accomodate a growing baby belly. It has helped relieve some of my friend's back aches and body tension as well as providing her with the opportunity to ""do something"" (her words). However, my friend did say that it took her a couple of sessions before she could do the whole video, but believes that was natural due to the increased tiredness that comes from being pregnant."
2,Terrible for Third Trimester,"Although this DVD contains modifications of the poses for each trimester, the modification for the third trimester basically involved sitting in a chair. I found many of the poses did not feel appropriate for a prenatal program, and did not feel any benefit from the program. I think that the program would be too easy in your first and second trimesters in addition to being almost useless in the third. It's also inconvenient to have to have a chair available for the program. The guided meditation at the end is too short. I strongly recommend the Divine Mother prenatal DVD instead of this one."
5,Very Helpful,"In my first pregnancy I used this yoga DVD and it helped me tremendously. I felt great for my entire pregnancy, the breathing helped me in labor and I had a quick recovery.During my second pregnancy I was doing Hatha yoga on a regular basis, during my first and second trimester this wasn't enough of a workout for me. Now that I am cumbersome and am getting ready for labor this DVD is exactly what my body needs.The meditations are not to far out there and the moves are easy to follow and feel great. If you are considering yoga during your pregnancy this DVD is the perfect one for everybody."
4,Yoga bores me...,"Pre-pregnancy I tried several yoga classes and found that yoga bores me. Now that I'm pregnant, I thought it would be good for me to try it again, because I hear such positive things in general, like how it makes labor easier, etc... This DVD is great because it gives examples for each trimester as to how to modify certain poses/stretches. And if you are into yoga and pregnant, this DVD is a must have. But, pregnant or not, yoga still bores me. I still try to do the DVD at least once a week though. One of many sacrifices I expect I'll make for this baby!"
4,Focus and flexability,"I have enjoyed this video so far and found that it is a good demonstration of all 3 trimesters, as it shows modifications for each pose involved by pregnant women. The only thing I personally dislike is that it is a little heavy on ""triangle"" pose, which is supposed to releave tension in the shoulders, but sometimes it feels like it adds to it. I am interested in getting more videos for variety, and look forward to experiencing more prenatal yoga."
5,Relaxing and peaceful,"I don't do yoga. I actually don't exercise much. But I bought this DVD anyway since I was curious. I find it relaxing to watch and try to do the moves but feel big and pregnant. But I still enjoy having it on because it's calm and soothing. My only caveat is that my husband pointed out that Shiva Rea pronounces ""exhale"" without the ""h"" and after a while I guess that sort of bugs me. Not that diction is a reason to buy a yoga DVD. I bought another prenatal workout video but much prefer this one because of the soothing nature."
1,"poor production, annoying instruction","i have used many fitness tapes throughout my three pregnancies and this one ranks as one of the worst...t though the living arts films were ok in the past, but this is dreadful...the instructor doesn't talk, she does a voiceover, the moves are designed for advanced yoggies, not someone with mild knowledge of the trait...i highly suggest something else other than this to help stretch and tone during pregnancy"
2,Didn't really care for this,"I didn't care for this tape at all. The host wasn't very good and I didn't care for all of the ""new age"" stuff that was part of the tape. It didn't really keep my interest at all. I bought the Yoga Mama tape and I liked it a lot more."
3,"Nice, but not as much of a workout as I was looking for","I think this is probably a great video if you are looking for some nice and relaxing stretching. However, it moved too slowly for me to feel like I was maximizing my time. It is a long video, but could have been condensed to have more punch per minute. Had that been the case, I think I would have really enjoyed it.I really like having the model for each trimester.It's a nice item to have in the mix when you have time and want something to mix up your routine or for relaxing."
2,Don't like this workout,I have bought and enjoyed several yoga dvds in the past. When I got pregnant I wanted to buy a good prenatal yoga dvd. I've been pretty disappointed in the workout that this dvd provides. Mostly I don't like anything relating to the chair workouts (which there are many). Also there is no way to directly jump right into the workout when you start playing the dvd (lack of menu options). I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this dvd. I would not recommend this to anyone.
3,Not challenging,"This video was a disappointment. I purchased based on the reviews, and am sad to say that this is hardly a worthwhile workout. If you are in the 1st or 2nd trimester, chances are, you are able to move around and work out, but this video does not help. If you're looking for a video that will help you stay active and in shape during your pregnancy, this is not for you."
3,A little too much OM,"While I like Yoga and the benefits it gives both during pregnancy and after, this video was incredibly slow. Shiva Rea's voice was so monotoned, I found myself looking up at the tv trying to figure out what she was talking about. While some of the positions were nice and I felt like I was stretching, I was too busy being annoyed by all the spiritual aspects of the narration. If you like that sort of thing, you'll probably like this video. BUT, if you are like me and like yoga for the stretching and work out and NOT the spirituality...save your money!"
2,So SLOOOOOWWWWWW,"I have a sporadic yoga practice, having held a very strong practice within the past few years, but falling in and out of it depending on the studio's schedule and price changes. I'm not able to spend $15 per class on my studio's classes, and thought the reviews for this were pretty good.In general the DVD is extremely slow moving. It's hard for me to even emphasize HOW SLOW this practice moves. It's broken up into three parts, which makes maintaining a flow very difficult. She explains every single move in detail, and speaks faster than she actually does the moves, so you're left WAITING for her to finish. Overall, I was not satisfied. It was nice to see the adjustments for those in each trimester, but she moves so slowly, that I don't even think it's necessary. For reference, I'm 4 months pregnant and started the dvd in my second trimester."
1,wanted to fall asleep,"This was by far the most boring yoga workout I've ever done. On top of that you have to skip over to much to get to the actual workout. I prefer the pop in and go, not pop in and skip over the ads and talking"
4,Great for beginners!,"I've always wanted to try yoga and finally got around to it @ 25 weeks into my first pregnancy. I found the flow of the DVD and poses easy to follow without having any prior experience with yoga. If you're new to yoga, you will probably have to look at the TV and pause and rewind a few times to make sure you're doing the poses correctly, but I got the hang of it quickly.Up until now, I have been an avid jogger and cardio exerciser, so I wasn't sold on the benefits of yoga until a week into this DVD. While I don't break into a sweat doing this, I can already feel a difference in my body. I can't quite put my finger on it - whether I feel stronger, more centered, more relaxed - but my body already craves yoga like I used to crave jogging if I hadn't been out in a few days. I think this has helped with the mild lower back pain I was starting to feel as well.Highly recommend this DVD!"

4,For the wait - It's worth it,"""Live at Rockpalast"" was beyond my expectations in performance and sound. I'm not implying the sound couldn't be better. The sound hitting my ear drums was beyond any reservations I made before opening the box. This DVD is almost better then sex. Not really, but it makes the point. Look - I have been a PIL fan since I was a lad listening to Dr. Demento and heard ""FFF"" from Album on his program. Hearing that made me realize I had to earn more money cutting grass so I could by more of PIL's catalog. Now, being a fan of metal/punk/alternative/whatever growing up in south Fla was not easy. People looked at me like I was possessed. In the end, it's all worth it..."
2,self-fulfilled prophesy,"If you watch the Tom Snyder interview with John and Keith, John keeps saying it's a company, not a rock and roll band 'doo-dah'. And several years later, as this video proves, it's become just a business. I am a big fan, and i can't believe (Lydon even says he's bored, halfway through) how dull this is. I wish there were some live Husker Du 'concert' footage from this era."
4,Great read....will thoroughly wierd you out!!!,"I happened upon this book at a yard sale, and took it home to read--it had to be over 20 years ago. I have NEVER forgotten this book---it is so shocking, and so twisted-you have to read it to believe it-even by todays standards. I do not know whatever happened to Craig Jones, or to that book, but I will tell you this-I have never read anything that impacted me in quite the same way. I have to agree with the reviewer who titled his/her review holy ****, because that just about explains it all!"
3,auriculotherapy manual,"Pleased with the book, but not spiral bound like advertised. the spiral binding makes it so you can leave it open to a page while giving a treatment, as a reference. Sense I need the book now for school, I had no time to return it."
3,Auriculotherapy,More of a book for a student studying Acupressure rather than just the general inquiry
5,A helpful and user-friendly auriculotherapy guide,"This is a well organized and beautifully presented introduction to auriculotherapy. Helpful features for the practitioner include a lay-flat spiral binding (perfect for the classroom/workshop setting, where one can refer to the book while examining a real person's ear), a colorful pull-out chart (with points clearly labeled and easy to read), and points from both the Chinese and French systems. There's a useful introductory section on the history and theory of ear acupuncture. The points are grouped in multiple ways, so one can easily find points via anatomical location on the ear, functional grouping (body systems and special points), and therapeutic use (particular disorders or conditions). Interesting additional material includes a discussion of electrotherapy and ear acupuncture and suggestions for diagnosis."
3,Somewhat confusing,"This book is adequate. But, being a TCM acupuncture student, I wanted a book strictly on Chinese Ear Acupuncture. Keep in mind that this book is not it. It has Chinese acupuncture points, but they are combined in the same diagrams as the European version of acupuncture. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm looking at the Nogier version of acupuncture treatment or the Chinese version. For me, it's better to separate the two systems, even if some of the points are jointly agreed upon and set as international standards."
4,LOTS of information,"More informative than I expected. Very important book for serious auricular practice. This book had some printing issues, so I returned it with the Amazon policy and had a replacement the next day (GREAT service)."
4,Good Cream,I have used other more expensive brands and I have to say this cream is just as effective. The other kinds have a funny smell and this one doesn't stink nearly as bad. I like that!This cream was recommended to me to help me get pregnant and also to stay pregnant! I am currently 13 weeks along! I can't say if it was ONLY the cream because I was also doing other fertility treatments at the same time as well!If you suffer from infertility and have had a miscarriage I would highly recommend talking to your doctor about using progesterone cream. My doctor has me using the cream a little differently than most people use it. She decided on the dose based on my symptoms and health history. Talk to your doctor first!If progesterone cream is right for you I recommend this brand!
3,AutoCAD LT 2007 the necessary upgrade,There are definitely some improvements over my previous version 2004 but are they worth it? I don't think so. This company has such a lock on the industry and if you work with other design professionals you have to keep current with AutoCAD which is the only reason I bought it.
3,"Useful, but not necessary.","""Spark Notes Oedipus Trilogy"" - I only used these ""Spark Notes"" for the play ""Oedipus Rex"" (or ""Oedipus The King""). They were helpful in distinguishing the climax and bits of dialogue, but it's nothing spectacular. I ""sorta"" recommend."
3,nice looking watch,"Movado Midsize Sport Edition SE Watch #0605078I love it .It's elegant but I can't tell time exactly. However, I am disappointed, because the watch is not accurate for a Movado name. I am not sure yet whether the battery needs to be changed or not. But it is not accurate."
5,Awesome casual sophistication,"I am not a collector, however, This is my 4th Movado and 3rd from Amazon and for the price I would have been crazy not to buy it. It is great."
1,stuck at the station,I cant get into this game. I think it is missing an understandable tutorial. I hate reading directions to games- so therefore I dont play it.
2,Big disappointment,"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. This game had so much potential. The puzzles are fun and there is a pretty good variety of Lionel trains to choose from. Even the music is surprisingly well done. However, it's all wasted because the graphics are so poor and the detail non-existent when it counts. One camera angle only and most of the game is in 2-D, especially when the trains are running. After you make your choice of trains to run, the detail degrades so badly you realize it never mattered which train you chose anyway. Everything looks about the same and very unrealistic at that. Don't be fooled by the Lionel name. This game is a dud..."
4,fun for train lovers,We bought this for our 10 yr old daughter and she really enjoys it. At first she was frustrated trying to lay the track but we quickly realized the icon was there to do it and she off and running....fun way for any train lovers to build a system.
2,Not what I expected...,"I bought Lionel Trains: On Track for my son. I played it for ten minutes and knew he wouldn't care for it. The graphics of the trains weren't great, and game play was slow. Hard to understand the graphic icons and just... You get the picture I am sure if they had more detail on the game play I would have never bought this game."
4,Not for young Children,"I bought this for my 6 year-old son because he's a HUGE Thomas/Lionel fan. He loves to play in the ""sandbox mode"" because nothing costs. I'm not sure that he knows exactly what he's doing, but he loves it. This game isn't very easy to play, but my son absolutely loves it."
4,Better than expected!,"My 8 year old son got this for Christmas and can't put it down. Mostly, he just like to put it in sandbox mode and build elaborate tracks with lots of different trains. True, the graphics could be better, IMHO, but I haven't heard any complaints from him. If you have a child that likes to build things and likes trains, I'd recommend this. It's a thinking game, though, and not really for the ""shoot-em-up"" or racing crowd."
3,Was expecting better.,"Sandbox mode is the only mode worth playing, other than that, it's just kinda boring after you get all the routes and track built. The trains look very nice, and very detailed, but it really loses a lot after about 20 min. Rent this game before buying."
3,Game On track,I bought this for my grandson that is 6 yrs. This is not a game for a child. there needs to be more explanation when buying.
3,Works but awkward to clean,Works but awkward to clean and seems to wear out faster than I had expected. Netting is delicate inside and is anything but lifetime - maybe 2 yrs at most if lucky.
1,cracked,this thing was crached when i received and the black carbon was messed up. I really had a concern how did they ship it?
1,NOT AS GOOD AS THE REGULAR ONE,THIS DOES NOT PICK UP NO WHERE NEAR WHAT THE REGULAR ONE DOES. I MEAN THE 4 CARBON FILTERS AND 1 HAPA FILTER
2,not at his best!,"I have long been a Tex Ritter fan and have loved his music. But from this anthology and the other Bear Family anthologies I have learned that Tex recorded a lot of songs, country songs, that he would have been better advised to stay away from. Much in this collection are, frankly, not very good. What I've come to realize is that Capitol Records, for whom he recorded so much, were very careful in selecting what to release to the record-buying public from Tex. And here Capitol Records served him very well. A lot of record companies are not that careful.I am generally happy to have any Tex Ritter recordings but a great many of these were simply not worthy of him."
2,Not compatible with Nokia 3200 phone,"This seems like a nice product. However, as of March 26, 2004, even though this product claims to work with the Nokia 3200, it is actually NOT compatible with that cell phone. It does not fit into the bottom of the phone.After calling Jabra technical support (1-800-EAR-2230), they said that I have to buy ""the basic model"" and they said that model needs an adapter to work with the Nokia 3200. You have to call Jabra to get the adapter. They are mailing me one for free, but it's obviously a hassle. And to be honest, I haven't figured out which ""basic model"" I need to get to use with the adapter."
5,Perfectly Pleased....Again,"The novel came within the two weeks, though very near the end, of the waiting period and was in perfect condition. I have nothing bad to say about my experience."
2,"Buy it if you need it for a class. Otherwise, avoid.","This book is boring. It's pretty hard to get through. I bought it because I needed it for a class. When the class was over, I was glad to sell it. This is not a fun or exciting book.The binding, etc, is good. I mean, the book quality is good. But the content therein is lacking."
3,great but still missing,"this is a great second volume , larger than the first . as of the last review circles is on the first best of , solar fire is not, missing on this one also , as well as runner a #22 hit in the usa . oh well cant have it all. buy it , manfred is all good....later"
3,Merchants of death exposed in somewhat tedious detail,"Philip Hilts has an ax to grind and he does so with determination. However, the writing tends to be repitious, pedantic and just plaing boring. There are some lively parts, particularly the testimony he includes from Jeffrey Wigand, which the movie ""The Insider"" was based on. The skillful deceit of the tobacco companies is also fully exposed and some parts are fascinating. If only he wouldn't keep making the same points over and over. Basically, if anyone if doing a paper on smoking as an addiction this book would be a good reference."
2,Disappointingly small,This piece is very small and the spiral to hang the towel on looks cheezy. Very flimsy when compared to other towel holders I have seen and used. My advice is to look for a better one that will fit in with the other Italian Chef decor available.
1,Not worth paying for,"Maybe this item should have come with instructions. Seems like it would be easy, just wrap your towel end around the center coil and it SHOULD hold right. Not. My regular dish towels kept falling out of the coil. I tried my bathroom handtowel in it because its thicker and it stayed just fine. Being as I have yet to find any dishtowels with my chef theme that are as thick as my bath handtowel I have to give this item only 1 star."
5,A beautiful book to treasure!,"Combine Bruce Coville, master of myth and fantasy, exquisite art, eleven magnificent stories, and a glorious poem, and what do you get? --An exceptional book, a treasure for those who love unicorns and fantasy. These unicorns are not the goody-goody, pink-bowed unicorns of some publications. These unicorns show depth of spirit, some are ugly, some fiery, some brave and gutsy. One of my favorites is the story by Kathryn Lay. This unicorn brings healing to a girl in a wheelchair, but not in the way you'd expect. I won't give away the ending. You'll have to the read the story for yourself. I highly recommend this amazing, wonderful book to all. You'll be uplifted and inspired."
5,A delightful read,"I'm sure this book is meant for young readers but I am not young (in years), and I enjoyed it. The short stories are varied and will appeal to anyone who is fascinated by unicorns and has a good imagination. I especially liked the illustrations by Alix Berenzy which accompany each story. Thanks to Bruce Colville for this delightful complilation as well as his interesting introduction."
4,Image is not the same as shirt,I just received the shirt and I love it. But the shirt has a chest pocket which I did not want. The image does not show this.
2,outdated,phone apps work better and have more range. A bit too tedious to get out and write when you're on edge anyway trying to figure out breastfeeding as it is.
3,Finally received my order,"I finally received what I had ordered, the Dean Markley SR2000 bass strings. They arrived a few weeks after they were ordered. However, I was charged for them immediately and the charge date that appeared on my credit card was the day after I placed the order, no matter that the item was backordered and they had access and use of my money weeks before I received the item.I have used these particular strings for years and will continue to use them. But, I don't know if I can again order them and wait while I am being charged for them."
2,Presidential Libraries,"This book is not bad, but have to wonder why there are so many gaps in every section. Looks like big blocks of nothing. Was there supposed to be a picture? Or did the author just leave big gaps to separate info and to make book bigger. That was the only disappointing part of the book. Am wishing I'd purchased another book instead."
3,needed netting,"I was going out of the country and needed some mosquito netting locally I couldn't find any so I ordered from Amazonit came it was OK but not very durable,but it worked probably wont be able to use again though"
3,"Looks like good quality, but bulky","I just received two mosquito nets and they look like they're very good quality, but they are bulky. Don't recommend them for backpacking..."
4,Bought two and both worked as advertised...,Got these for my boys for camp and they both worked fine and came back in good shape. We didn't use the included strings and hooks but rather pvc pipe stands topped with tennis balls to support these. They hold up pretty well-I stil have one from 4 years ago in good shape.
4,Kasparov is still Champ!,"I'm on page 175 and I've caught only 2 mistakes in analysis, using a fritz engine. This is amazingly good for such a large book, I love Kasparov's insights and interpretations. If you play chess, you must own this book, no exceptions."
2,"Good contents, but beware cheap binding of the later printings","I have the other 4 volumes in the series, which are all very nicely bound in fine red linen cloth. I ordered this volume from an Amazon seller, expecting to receive a cloth-bound book. It seems I received a later printing, which is technically a hard bound copy, but which is actually a trade paperback with its paper covers pasted onto stiff boards wrapped in cheap red paper, textured to resemble red cloth. Furthermore, the pages are affixed with a very stiff glue, and the first few pages are already coming loose, after opening it just a few times. The paper is also lower grade, with higher pulp content--certain to curl in high humidity.I'm quite exercised that this volume's binding and paper do not match the quality of the rest of my set. The cloth bound edition might still be available out there somewhere, if you hurry. But it might be prudent to specify the real cloth covered edition if that's what you're looking for."
2,"Kind of okay, sort of.",This book was not what I thought it would be. Gary Kasparov just talks about different chess players and their noteworthy games. Nothing one can't look up on the internet cheaper and faster.
4,Cat adores this bed!,"I bought the bed for my new puppy, but the moment I put it down the cat ran into it and wouldn't come out. He absolutely loves it and spends every day in it. I come home and see his wide eyes peeking out from under the hood.Yes when he lies way in the back it tips backward which might be a problem for some dogs, but the fluffiness can be flattened by hand to help this to not happen. The cat seems to enjoy it when it tips!So the cat has taken it over and now I'll have to find something else for the dog :)"
2,"Comfy for the dog, but not easy to burrow","This bed doesn't really do what it looks like it should- my little dog can burrow into ANYTHING, and she was never really able to get under the ""covers"" of this bed the way she wanted to! It was still really soft and looked comfy for her to lay on top of, but was the ""burrow"" functional...not so much. Other pet beds out there that probably make more sense."
5,My mini pins favorite thing,First let me say I have tried lots of beds for my dog and she hasnt been jazzed by any of them but this one was a hit out of the ball park!I have this on my bed for her to sleep in it.....That she can cuddle under the top is heaven to a dog who prior to this would try and crawl up my pajamas everynight. I guess that makes it heaven to me too :)Its nice and soft and cuddly - lots of cushioning.... Its probably the thing I bought for my little Ginger that she actually likes more than I do!
5,17 inch model good for small cats,"My Burmese kitten loves her little black Petmate Burrow Bed - it's relatively ""flat"" and hooded, so she can stretch out of the opening, or curl up against the hooded area as she pleases. At first I was a little concerned about the construction of the bed, because when she would cuddle into a corner of the bed, the bed would ""tilt"" and leave her in a bizarre angle (as the mattress area is fluffy and round)! But the more she sleeps on it, the more the padding compresses down, and now this is no longer a problem. Furthermore - the entire lining (hood and cushion cover) is removable and washable. Very nicely constructed, and highly recommended."
4,Pet Bed w/cover,"The cover doesn't really keep my Italian Greyhound warm because it doesn't cover him completely. He's happier with a small blanket thrown over his old bed that he can burrow under or ""paw at"" and arrange to his satisfcation. Also, the bed has a fleece lining that leaves ""fuzzzies"" all over the room. I think the bed is better for a very tiny pet."
4,PetMate Burrow Bed,"I have 3 small dogs, sized 12-20 lbs. They had taken over the couch. So I decided to purchase 3 of these beds and added a small dog heater to each one. The first bed came, and before the heater was added, 2 dogs were sleeping in it together, one inside and the small one on top. The other two beds soon arrived along, with heaters and all 3 are sleeping happily in them. They lay in them in the day and the couch is now free for the rest of the family. No more ugly, smelly dog blankets on the furniture and 3 toasty little bed bugs happy in their new digs."
2,Do I have mutant dogs?,"So many have given the Pet Burrow raves reviews that I violated my own policy of never buying anything on the web for the Lords of All Dogdom wthout first seeing it. That will teach me...Sparky, our Japanese Chin, who is very cat like in many other ways, could not figure out how to burrow in his burrow. Ollie, the Shih Tzu, would not even step into the burrow.When I tried to help them, they jumped out as quickly as they could. I gave it another try, and when the flap fell over I moved the two burrows down to my basement office.Perhaps I have mutant dogs, but the only use I can envision for these is as ""regifted"" items for my friends who have cats."
1,Nice until you wash it and then the zipper breaks,This is a cheaply made little bed. The fur is synthetic and after 1 wash the zipper was done. Which led to my pup ripping apart the padding. Now I've got the cover with a broken zipper and no padding.
2,Now I know why are grandparents went wrong...,"I was looking forward to some traditional parenting advice but was dismayed to find the book really lacking. I only read the second half of the book but the gist of the parenting advice was ""trust the experts."""
1,Stinky + sticky. Will look for another brand/formulation.,"Leaves my skin super sticky and dirty feeling (1 pump rubbed over EVERY area they suggest rather than just one). It also smells like half-rancid sunflower seeds. If this scent is ok with you, by all means buy it!"
5,OFFICAL WHITEHOUSE PHOTOS,INTERESTING BOOK WITH GREAT PHOTOS OF HOW THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES ENTERTAINED- REFLECTING SOMETHING ABOUT THEM IN THE CHOICE OF THE PATTERS FOR THEIR CHINA.
4,Jay-Z was on a role..,"Jay-Z is a rap icon and consistency has been his middle name. most soundtracks are weak but this is a pretty good effort. Tracks like ""In My Lifetime"", ""Only A Customer"", and ""Murdergram"" all hit hard. What about the MOP Track...crazy..keep doing your thing ..young Hova.."
2,"A couple hits, rest some fluff for his friends to showcase","Jay Z is the real entertainer as we know...he is on the cover and is the promoter here. He shines when he is on the mic, but the others do get showcased being connected with him."
1,Let your kids be the judge...,I was disappointed when I saw how it had nothing to do with the lovable Original classic. I thought maybe its my maturity setting in - but my 3 and 2 year old basically gave this a bad review - they walked off after a few minutes into the story - too uninterested. I think the target audience is wrong in this one. The makers are trying way too hard to incorporate political issues at a time when all kids just want to see kid stuff!
1,Bad,I wish I had never seen this. I didn't realize it wasn't a follow up to the original Frosty. It's a shame it was done by the same person who gave us the charming Peanuts classics.
1,Sorry to have to say that I was disappointed!,"Frosty the Snowman was awesome but Frosty Returns is a shameful mess! All the characters are bratty, sarcastic and disrespectful, the children, Frosty but especially the adults, What kind of message does that give to children? That it's ok to be bratty and disrespectful?"
1,Dreadful,"I hated this special. Frosty is completely sarcastic and obnoxious, nothing like the friendly folksy Frosty we all grew to love. Even sadder is that CBS keeps airing this back-to-back with the original Frosty. There are so many other great Christmas specials which aren't aired on the major networks (Little Drummer Boy, George C. Scott's A Christmas Carol) because of cable and VCRs. So it's all the more sad that this one receives yearly attention by a major network. Couldn't they at least air the true sequel - Frosty's Winter Wonderland? ABC used to run that one, so I don't know who owns the rights nowadays. But either way, that would make much sense for a second half hour of Frosty rather than this dreadful piece of unwatchable junk."
2,"Frosty goes PC, with poor results","""Frosty Returns"" is the epitome of why classics from the 60s and 70s need not be remade. Although Jonathan Winters does a respectable job as narrator, the story suffers from ""politically correct"" environmentalism and de-Christianization of Christmas. None of it was necessary and detracts the story.Furthermore, there is no artistic continuity with the original ""Frosty"". None of the characters are depicted in their original form and the computer-aided animation doesn't really add anything, either.I was disappointed that this episode was included with the Frosty DVD. The true and worthy sequel to the original Frosty is ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"". Watch that instead as it is MUCH better than this one."
1,Worst Christmas special ever!,This is so lame! The songs are terrible! The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show. But the biggest lowpoint is the Politically Correct ranting! Too bad CBS insists on running this back-to-back with the 1969 classic.
1,Floppy,"This waste of time was shown on network immidiately following the original. Bad music, dated cheesy dialogue, and nothing to do with the original story."
1,Woo-hoo to Frosty--- Barf to Frosty Returns!,"I have always loved watching Frosty the Snowman ever since I was a little kid, and I found out that Frosty had a sequel and I couldn't wait to check it out on TV.That dumb movie was a big fat flop! The adults in the movie are arguing idiots and it makes the children seem smarter. (just like every nickelodeon cartoon now...) They don't even say the word ""Christmas"" once. I think the movie where Frosty marries his ""snow-wife,"" Crystal makes a better sequel than this lame crud!"
1,not to bad.,"i must say, though it didnt have the same joy as the first it was good. i thought mr twitchell was a funny name.i do say though, the ""summer wheeze"" trucks look appsilutley RIDICULOUSE!i loved the part when the bad guys fell into the pond. and this film came out the day before i was born. i liked it to a certain extent, but i could have been better. i noteced that when i recorded it and played it in slow motion, the animation showed things fade and have ghost pics of one thing. but all in all, i rcomend it."
4,They really do fly!,"We liked this book because the instructions were clear and easy to follow. Most of the planes are basic with a few unique ones thrown in. The book has more than 50 stickers to decorate the planes with. No fancy paper required. Most can be put together in 5 minutes or less. Our personal favorite? The ""Classroom Cruiser."""
5,Great live Aida,"I didn't realise that Gwyneth Jones can be so effective in an Italian role! Her portrayal of Aida is exceedingly fine with some great (and steady) singing. Domingo's Radames is, of course, a known quality and he is in good and youthful voice here. The supporting cast is very fine. Don't miss this precious release."
1,Clueless,I don't know whether it's the writer or this reader who's clueless. But this book left me completely cold. The physics experiment at the heart of the plot is so laughably non-scientific that it threw the whole thing off for me.
1,Reach Richard Powers instead,"If you want smart writing about scientists, read Richard Powers's 'The Gold Bug Variations'. If you want to read someone who is a wizard with words, read David Wallace. But don't read this one. It's a real dog."
1,Is there anything between the covers of this book,It is utterly incomprehensible how this book became published.It is simply an armature of arbitrary infantile charicatures -the main narrator is a dreadfully needy and smug male weight which calls up no relatable personification it simply exudes a constant obnoxiousness as a series of written phrases belieing the authors lack of talent and colossal laziness which as I said really makes me wonder what sort of publishing scam this is.Astoundingly dreadful as are many productions of the generation of the maximized self-esteem.
2,Doesn't stack up,"Two of Lethem's prior works, ""Gun with Occasional Music"" and ""Amnesia Moon"", offer so much more to the reader than ""As She Climbed Across the Table"". The earlier novels had characters that were likable or despicable--at least they were interesting. The worlds of those other books were the product of an active imagination.""As She Climbed Across the Table"" manages to annoy where his earlier works captivated. The characters aren't interesting or likable and the setting is a modern-day American University. There's nothing to grab the user and make them love anything about the book.Lethem throws in some random science talk in the last chapter to allow the book to be called science fiction. Otherwise, it's a soap opera--and a boring one at that."
1,Half-baked,"This is the scatterbrained novel of a man in love with words, but not with ideas. The science is punk, the plot incoherent, and one doesn't give a hoot for the characters."
3,Almost 'pataphysique,"It wasn't awful; it had it's good points: some striking metaphors, a couple of really fresh and interesting characters. But overall, it was shallow and full of holes.The ""physics"" were mythical to say the least -- but not whimsical enough to be jarryesque. The semiotics were downright dumb. The psychology was glib. And the characters were mostly flat and as dull as a good deal of the prose.Oh well. There were the two blind co-dependants who captured the heart and the imagination and who would have made a good book in themselves. And, like I said, Lethem does show off a talent for metaphor.But that's the trouble with so much contemporary fiction: the authors show very specialized talent and no respect for their own higher sensibilities."
4,A Welcome Addition,"I had no idea what to expect with this album, but was pleasantly surprised by the song selections and how well they were done. While far from perfect (Diane butchers the lyrics to 'Hyperdrive' & 'Eskimo Blue Day' and the voices sound a bit strained here and there), the feeling was still there in most of the songs. In fact, while different people play in the band and this is recorded in a time far different from the '60's and '70's, the connection is apparent. While we've all (hopefully) moved on with our lives, Starship hasn't lost touch with their foundation. I could do without hearing the sprinkling of profanities, as they were a kick to use when I was 17 but now they just sound juvenile. If you're a fan of live music over studio tracks as I am, you'll like this album a lot. If not, you'll still have a substantial appreciation for all this CD represents."
4,The beginnings of Starship the Next Generation,"The Airplane came apart around 1972. This is a live album, recorded with the equipment of it's time. It's flawed, but it reminds me of a lot of live recordings of the Airplane: blowing a note, the monitors being too loud et al. This band does not sound like the Airplane, because it's not. Nor is it the commercial favorite crap of the ""Other Jefferson Starship"". It's raw, and doesn't work all the time. Try listening to the more recent recordings from the Starship. Then look at this as just the beginnings of another part of the band. As to Paul, and his accountant ""Wanting this to sell"", is there something evil in making a living?"
5,Fantastic music!! How can anyone not enjoy this group?!,"Found The Old World on MP3.com and after listening to a couple songs, just had to get their CDs. Haven't gotten their first one yet, but have this one and it is SUBERB. They have a sound similar to Jethro Tull but better. Great music and lyrics."
3,Interesting perspective on Wall Street,"Compelling read revolving around Wall Street research, a part of the industry that hasn't been seen as ""sexy"" before. I like how Sernovitz portrayed all the inner conflicts in Chris, the main character, as this is often prevalent with research people who have to publish their opinions widely and have their clients make big $ decisions accordingly. A little Jay McInerney in showing what is arguably the seemy side as through the expose. I would have ranked it higher, but some of the mind games and related prose were over the top."
2,Really outdated!,"This book is somewhat helpful but hopelessly outdated. Ukraine is changing rapidly and this book just is not of much use at all! See if you can buy it used, but don't waste your money on a new copy."
3,Foundation information about Ukraine,"Well written, concise look at many aspects of Ukraine. I will know better after I have visited myself."
3,Same music as other discs,"This is another compilation disc - the original albums were ""Rising of the Moon"" and ""Come Fill Your Glass With Us"". You can buy the originals in digitally remastered form if you're an audio stickler, or in a compilation that seems to be identical to this one, called28 Irish Pub Songs. I don't have both compilations to compare. Neither claims to be digitally remastered. At present, anyway, this MP3 set costs more than that MP3 set, so I got the other set."
5,Good read,"Great read, I enjoyed this Erich Fromm book. This isn't school and I don't feel like I need to right a summary."
1,Boring...,"This is the most boring piece of audio I have ever listened to, and I like Erich Fromm and the psychologists and philosophers from his era. Fromm's truly great books at ""The Art of Loving"" and ""Escape From Freedom"". In both, Fromm discusses man's drive for unity with one another..Dave"
5,Love this ballet music,"I love the wonderful pieces in this album. Mostly familiar classical music, which is exactly what I wanted. Some of the pieces are short, but you can make them repeat."
3,so great when it worked....,"My cats loved this when it worked!They played with it for a month and then when it came time to change the batteries, the laser stopped spinning around... I could not fix it because I could not open it up to see what was wrong.I feel like things today are so disposable and it really bothers me that nothing is made to last... and this was kind of expensive at Petco so I am frustrated that it is broken and I threw the box away after 3 weeks of great fun...So, this was great when it worked, but I am so frustrated that it broke. It was such a hit though that I will most likely by another...."
3,"""And Your Name Is Jonah""","This Title should make DVD with CC or Subtitle! cuz they're cool part of sign Language by Deaf boy and The Parent look for to learn sign Language to make son happy can talk with parent! this Title great as we collected many movies "" Johnny Belinda"",""Heart is an Longly Hunter"",""Man has a thousand faces"",""Love is an silent"" as more deaf movies! Please touch with company to make Title "" And Your Name Is Jonah"" subtitle or CC! Please open voting! as Is help you yes or no? Thank!!!!!! Chester"
2,"Excellent project, but book is a disaster","All the contributors, projects and initiatives mentioned in the book are indeed worthy of applause.However, the book is simply a hodgepodge of references, difficult to read, and flows poorly.Finally, Amory Lovins is NOT the author! He contributes a brilliant forward to the publication, but is not the author.Basically, you're best served buying the books by Lovins and McDonough, then following progress on the topics they discuss via RMI website and the site mentioned by this book's authors."
3,Interesting and Imaginative Story,"This movie is a family film with no objectionable scenes. The story has a ""Twilgiht Zone"" flavor. In fact, there was a ""Twilight Zone"" episode, which was much better about a smiliar subject. The simple premise shows creativity and is different than a standard film. Probably with a higher budget, better special effects could have been used. When the main characters talk into the camera, a viewer is distracted from the absorbing premise. Model train enthusists should enjoy this film, as well as children. The moral of the film is good for discussion with your family."
2,Not large enough for n800,"There is a good 1/8 inch gap on all sides. 2 stars because what it does cover, it covers well."
5,For those who don't know,"Rhythm Signal sound like King Crimson, Pink Floyd, and Fantomas smashed together. The music goes from one extreme to the next: spacey and trance-like then crazy with odd time changes. The music is mostly improvised.This cd is an Ep with only a brief glimpse at what Rhythm Signal offers but it is well worth it."
5,Good tool for the price...,"I'm very happy with the quality of this tool, especially at the low price I paid for it. It's solid and does what it was designed to do."
2,"Great idea, but doesn't work for us","We have a medium sized black lab (60 lbs) and this collar doesn't work in a practical way for us. I'm only 5'5"" tall, so that isn't the issue. It will be worse for anyone taller. I bet it would work for a taller dog, though. The ""leash"" only extends a couple inches, so I really have to bend over in order to ""walk"" my dog with it. It also really pulls on my dog's neck so she does that coughing/choking thing. I tried making it looser to give me another inch, but then it just slips off her neck."
2,Built in leash was a joke,"I bought this collar so that I could let my dog walk off leash, but I would have the ability to grab him and control if we came upon a distraction. Well it works as a collar but forget the leash part. It pulls out of the collar about 2 or three inches, and is incredibly hard to get it out at all. You have to pull so hard on the leash part I think his eyes were crossing when I tried it. I would pass on this one..."
2,Bamboo collar handle snaps,"I was very disappointed in this product. It was great for about three weeks and then the silver bones popped off. The next day, the handle snapped off one side. I have tried to reach the company that makes this product but they have never gotten back to me"
1,frays like crazy,"I like the idea of the collar and the ""handle"" works well however the collar frays so much in a short period of time. I also have the leash but have had no problem with it."
2,Great Idea but...,"This collar is a great concept. Unfortunately the materials are lacking. We love the control without a leash, very handy at the Vet or taking the dog for a shampoo, anything. We have a German Shepherd and this keeps her very much under control without getting tangled in a leash. The problem is that after a few months the collar starts to fray and once it starts it gets bad quickly. The first time this happened we had boarded our dog and figured it was due to other dogs nipping at the collar. We replaced it with the same collar that we loved so much only to have it fray again. Due to a need for another collar cheap and fast we actually bought a third and yes, that one soon frayed as well. ( no other dogs involved ) Like I said great idea but it needs to be made with more durable materials or just better constructed."
3,Yet another mind - bender in the year of the title,"Yes this is actually World War 3 '95, but WCW didn't release the tape until early '96 and stupidly titled the release ""World War 3 '96. Go figure! This can't help anyone potentially interested in buying old wrestling videos who hasn't already seen them as it is very confusing to those not in the know. This was the first of these events and,if memory serves features one of Sabu's few WCW matches."
4,Nice Headphones,"Bought it refurbished, but am yet to regret it. The sound quality is very good. My only complaint is that I cannot use this for extended durations, my ears hurt due to the fit perhaps and the non-absorbent nature of the ear pads! Maybe I have big ears and perspire too much ;-)Bottom line - A good buy indeed."
1,""" What ever happened to telling the truth?""","This book is supposed to be Non-Fiction. Well, as the daughter of one of the men who was murdered in this book I can tell you the ""truth"", and this ""Tough Guy"" is a liar. He has had someone write a book that makes him look like some kind of poor soul that the world had taken advantage of. Well he's alive because he was a two-faced liar. He used everyone he came in contact with and ended up getting other people killed because of his stupidity. It's bad enough to read about my fathers murder, but to read the inacuracy of how he said my father died made me sick to my stomach. He had no right to use peoples names in his book that can not defend themselves, but I guess we shouldn't expect anything decent from this inacurate, pathological liar. The only reason that I gave this book 1 star is because it wouldn't let me put in 0."
5,No sympathy for the devil....,"The story of Eddie Maloney's life is an interesting tale of poor choices and poorer ones. I have no sympathy for the things that happened to him, either in jail or on the streets or bars. He is the truest meaning of lowlife there is. Besides, does the publishing company really think that people are stupid enough to believe that this guy really wrote the book. This book should be labeled ""as told to"". The words and phrases are way too educated and intelligent to have been part of Eddie's natural vocabulary, but the book is a good one anyway. It keeps your attention and you want to find out what happens to him next (not that anyone could possibly sympathize with him in any way). It goes into great detail about all the prisons in this country that he was in and proves that our justice system is really a sham."
4,The Jewish Book of Why & The Second Jewish Book of Why (2 volumes in... Alfred J. Kolatch,I purchased this 2-volume set to be able to answer some of the questions I had regarding the Jewish faith. Interesting.
4,Baffled,"There is need for additional information about this recording. The previous reviews suggest this is both a live and 1959 recording, however a close look at the CD cover (lower right) indicates that this is a 1975 recording. The notes on back say that only the 3rd Act is from 1959. Please note in fairness that rating the CD is a requirement of posting comments here; I haven't actually heard the recording."
4,my review,"I think this book is a great idea, especially since its for charity.. I was really happy that my story is in it as well. lol. Anyway... the other ppls in this book are talented writers.. check it out, its aweseom"
1,DANGEROUS BOOK,"After 18 months over dating , I thought I would give this book to my boyfriend in hopes he could come to a decision about marriage or the possibility in the following year.Before this everything was fine!After I put this PRESSURE on him to think about what he wants, etc. He BOLTED and cheated on me- something that is not even natural for him out of total fear!I think the realtionship is over for good now because I could not wait until HE WAS READY to do this on his own- Don't make the same mistakes I did- throw out ""the Rules"" and these other manipulative this that tell you how to make a man marry you and give ultimatums. Any time you use these tactics you are taking a risk they will backfire on you. I would do anything to take back what I did, but it is to late (probably) and I will have to learn from my mistakes."
2,This book is a pep talk,"I bought this book to try to get over a paralyzing fear that I felt about a big commitment step that I was sure, in the long term, I wanted to take. I was hoping it would provide me some insight into why I was afraid, and how to get over it. It did provide some small comfort that other men seem to have gone through the same stuff, but on the downside, the whole thing reads like a Cosmo article. It is punctuated with silly lists of things to always do or never do (which is great, because all relationships are the same, right?), it actually advises you to keep certain things secret from your potential life mate (wtf?), and if I could boil it down to one sentence, I'd say this book essentially says, ""Don't worry, don't worry, it's going to be fine."" Well that may be true. But I was hoping for something to help me feel better in the long term, not to give me upbeat liquid courage to accidentally make the right decision."
3,Q and Vash pay a fun filled little visit to Deep Space Nine,"Q shows up at Deep Space Nine with Vash; apparently the two have had a falling out since Q promised to show Vash the universe (Star Trek: The Next Generation Episode 94, ""Qpid""). Strange power fluctuations begin to affect the space station, but Q insists he has nothing to do with it. Yes, only seven episodes into the series and already John de Lancie shows up as Q. Of course Q cannot possibly have as much fun with Sisko as he does with Jean-Luc Picard, and while de Lancie's performance is wonderful, this episode is a trifle. Sisko and his merry crew are a step behind virtually the entire episode and why Q would ever be obsessed with Vash is light years beyond me."
2,Q-less? Plot-less more like it!,"In a desperate attempt to draw audiences similar to that of The Next Generation Q was drafted into this poor episode that does nothing for the series, or the ratings. The intelligent, witty and irritating Q of Next Gen fame is no where to be seen, instead we have a guy who can appear and re-appear at will each time giving some clues to help the failing plot move along. Terrible. A wonderful scene takes place with Sisko and Q boxing, but is it worth the 43 minutes of rubbish? Q works in the Next Gen and Voyager, but not on DS9."
1,Q IS BACK!!! IN ALL HIS OMNIPOTENCY,"If you follow trek then you already know the cleverness of the Q,now get ready as Q takes on a new crew at deep space nine.Definetly one of the best shows for the first season!"
1,quick control collar with built in leash,"Not at all what I was expecting. Not an extendable leash what so ever, more like what would be needed for close handling for an unruly hard to handle dog. I expected a short retractable leash for a dog who doesn't need one, just something to appease the town sheriff while on walks that is easy to grab on to with out having to clip something on all of the time. Besides that it is a Great color, and I do like the D ring set up but as far as a leash, it is not."
3,NOT for small dogs,"I recently purchased the Quick Control Collar, Medium for our rat terrier/fiest mix. He is 15 pounds of solid muscle and isn't very friendly with others. I thought this would be a great tool to help control him. While the quality appears to be VERY GOOD, the collar itself is HUGE. The buckle alone is over 2 inches long and well over an inch wide. Between the buckle and the extra material for the leash, the collar is very heavy and unwieldy. I was hoping for a good solid collar and that's what I got but it's way too much for any dog smaller than 30 pounds."
3,"Good Product, If You Want To Strangle Your Dog","I got this thinking I could take my dog out to go potty without having to worry about leashing her. The problem is the built in ""control"" isn't long/elastic enough for me to grab standing upright without my dog hanging and choking from the collar. The only way this collar works with the ""control"" is: 1) if you have a very tall dog (i.e. Marmaduke) 2) if you are shorter than 4' tall. Otherwise when you use the built in ""control"" you will end up lifting your dog up and choking her."
2,not as good as it looks,I bought this collar to hold onto my dog when people came to the door.The handle works quite well but the overall feel of the collar is bulky. It has a very large buckle and the handle makes it very thick. It may look better on a large dog but it was too much for my medium dog. My other complaint was that the colored edging began to fray within the week and then unravelled. I had to return it and I am disappointed as it looked like a good idea.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COLLAR,Our nine month old golden retriever died last night because she was wrestling with her brother. His jaw got tangled in the elastic strap and it strangled her. So upsetting.
2,"Disappointing, not at all erotic","It looks so pretty and contains so little of worth. A couple of dull pieces by the editor, some unintelligible ones by others, and a few bright lights by the likes of Amy Bloom and Jane Hirshfeld. Not worth the read."
1,NO...AND I WOULD RATHER NOT...,"This is a so not funny bumper sticker that makes light of violence, drive by shootings, and needless road rage. It may even attract the bearer of this sticker unwanted attention of the wrong sort. The implications of this bumper sticker are anathema to anyone who is against violence in any sort of form. Avoid slapping this one on your bumper, unless you are a total meathead."
5,Alexandra,This stuff smells really good! An instant turn on! Order process was smooth and delivery was quick.
1,Terrible,"I purchased this printer less than six months ago, and since then have gotten on a first-name basis with Compaq tech support. The printer is very easy to install, but configuration must be done beyond that, and only tech support can walk you through it. This printer may work fine on other versions of Windows, but I do not recommend it for XP. As for printing, the quality is good, if you up the resolution. The resolution must be bumped up even for B&W docs. The printer is terribly slow. I have already bought a new printer to replace this one, and will be choking on my losses (I think I paid [money] back in January), and selling it to the high bidder on [site]."
1,"This is not the band called Gravel from Anacortes,Washington State","This is not the band called Gravel from Anacortes,Washington State,who did two albums for Estrus Records.This is just a band with the same name from Delaware,and the music is really horrible."
1,There are better textbooks,"I have found several inconsistences in this textbook. In most chapters the model is not introduced until ""after"" the first problem is worked through, not ensuring that there is any understanding of the model. I've noticed a lack of strict adherence to the model, and because of that there are few reinforcements of a students basic understanding. There are assumptions that the student is not at all confused or weak on any of the basics, and that leads to further confusion. Although the textbook is supposed to be setting a foundation for continued math learning, it does more to confuse the student than enlighten. For the money spent, new or used, this textbook is far from being a useful tool."
5,his phone is awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i go this phone from an arcade game for 50 cents!!! and it actully works really well. the camera is good and its really load when it comes to ringtones. verizon is a smart company because it doesnot let u use your voice records as ringtones, if that was the case u could get free music ringtones. i cant say anything about the web because i have not been on it yet.uhhh.... thats about it i recomend this phone aolt"
2,Don't waste your money...,"I have been with Verizon Wireless since they started, and I have never had a phone last me the 2 years...this one is no different. I honestly think it is a scam. I think they intentionally make cheap and defective phones because they know you will renew your contract if you need a new phone (especially if it is free), so the ""New In Two"" was quite a clever marketing scam. This phone drops 1 of every 3 calls, and it will get really staticy ever time I use it...I can hear somewhat, but the person I am talking to can't hear a thing. The only good thing that I can say is that physically, it is a very well made phone. I am very hard on my phones and the hinge on the flip part usually breaks, but this one held up great. Techinally, it is just not a good phone, and even Verizon has admitted that there have been lots of problems with it."
1,Do NOT get this phone!,I upgraded to this phone after two years and it's been awful. I've gone through three of them. The first V276 they gave me lasted a month and then i couldn't hear people when they talked. So they replaced it. The next one they gave me had a problem shutting off when you closed the phone which caused the battery to die in a couple of hours. So they replaced it. The third one had a problem with the battery connection and stopped working all together and oops... now my warranty is over so no replacement. Some of my friends have the same phone and they all hate it. Save yourself the headache. Don't buy this phone just because it's cheap. However if you do be sure to purchase the extended warranty or you'll be sorry.
3,not bad but battery is horrible,"The phone overall is OK. Good reception, small, easy to use. Problems:1. The battery is TERRIBLE. If left uncharged overnight, it'll drop from 6 bars to 2, just sitting there. It barely lasts a day and a half of low usage.2. The phone book sucks. Although you can add more than 1 entry per person, the entries are not aggregated when displayed. So, if you have home/cell/work numbers assigned to a contact, ALL 3 will be displayed no matter what. That makes scrolling difficult.3. The phone construction is flimsy. The battery door is the cheapest junk plastic. It creaks when you press on it lightly."
1,Worst Phone Ever!!,"This is the worst mobile phone I have ever owned and I include my first phone in this statement. The phone doesn't hold a charge, drops calls for no reason, won't charge when plugged in, the list goes on. Everyone I know who has ever had this phone disliked it. Don't buy this phone, you'll regret it."
5,YOU GUYS DONT KNOW A TRUE MASTERPIECE WHEN YOU SEE ONE.,"I have no regrets about buying the Motorola V276. It's like a little piece of heaven for me. This phone plays real music tones and polyphonic tones. The battery sucks. The phone has a loud ring, great camera, and many other great features. Might not be great for an older person, but it the idea phone for someone in their teens. AWESOME!"
5,Great Phone!!!,"This is a great phone. I chose this phone over the RAZR because of all the rumors going around about the battery melting the phone. Plus this phone is way cheaper and worth it. There's text messaging, Get It Now, and mobile web. Get It Now has the best ringtones, besides V-Cast. I got Fresh Azimiz by Bow Wow, Gimmie That by Chris Brown, and Check On It by Beyonce. Each ringtone only cost $2.99. It's a great phone, the ringtones are bumping. I highly request you to choose this over the RAZR."
2,Don't even dream of getting that (...),"I bought the phone Aug of 2005. (...)The phone is OK, works alright, battery life is a little short, verizon has decent service except that they don't give you local number by defaut, imaging someone would get a phone that everybody in town would have to call long distance to reach you? That's what they believe.followup: (...)= rebate, they deleted it in my review..."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,So i bought this phone after having an LG for 2 yrs I decided it was time for a change definitely the BIGGEST MISTAKE of my life.. the first problem i had was I couldnt hear anything out of it! so I had to try it in for a new 2nd time I had to bring it because it wouldnt charger 3rd time which is right now --- long behold i still cant charge my phone.. first thing tomorrow Im headed to a verizon store to buy a new phone most likely an LG might as well stick with whats good! if you like problems this is the phone for you but i highly doubt you would want this cuz its been a yr.. and this phone is horrible
2,Not Worth It,"While this phone looks nice, and has a lot of features there are problems with the phone.I notice the ringer is not as loud as my Samsung was, and the screen is harder to read than on other phones.My latest problem is the AC charger doesn't seem to make firm connection with the contacts, and my phone died yesterday during a business call. It seems you have to wiggle the plug just right to get a connection. Going to see if Verizon will exchange it for a Samsung or comparable phone.I have only had this phone for less than two months."
1,What a piece of CRAP,"I agree!! This phone is a WASTE! I don't use it during the day because I'm at work, and when I go to make a phone call...I HAVE NO BATTERY!!! Can someone expalin this to me?? I mean seriously...the static is unbearable, and I have to hold the phone in a certain position to hear out of it even though the earpiece volume is set on the max. I also quite frequently pick up other peoples conversations on my phone..in the middle of my own conversation!!! I get signal like...NOWHERE with this piece of crap. TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE AGGRAVATION!!"
3,Closest model Motorola V265 has second highest SAR level,"As per CNET (http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6602_7-5020357-1.html?tag=lnav), model V265 has second highest SAR rating in US. I believe this V276 is very close to V265. I am not sure if I will go for this model..."
5,Surprisingly Great,"I heard this on the radio, and I could not figure out who it was. I was so impressed that I sat in the car and waited to find out. Johnny Cash uses the lyrics perfectly to fit his own style. It's amazing."
4,One Of the Few bands that could have made a difference.,"One Of the Few bands that could have made a difference.At the time I first heard this album I was Reviewing Music and Bands for Local Magazines in New York City, I felt then as I do now this was a band that had real Promise, out of the thousands and thousands of Cd's I owned and gave away Mary My Hope-Museum is still in My collection Although it's in the Form of a tape, that will change today because I finally found the CD here at Amazon. I was Hoping that they where the new rock for the 90's but then The grunge crap took the sheep by the balls and that was the end of music for the 90's finally after all that time rock is alive again."
4,Great Basic Ballet Class,"This is a great album of familiar tunes to dance to. I like introducing my students to classical ballet music during our classes, so this is a good album for that."
1,Please do not waste your money on this,"Linksys used to have a good name, but this product is a ripoff. The only way to get it to work with XP or Vista (maybe other operating systems, too) is to call Linksys tech service and agree to pay $32.50 for the updated software and other information available ONLY through this extra fee. I verified this with the tech rep, who gave me a hard sell trying to get me to pay the extra money. If they can't sell you a product that works out of the box, or at least works if you can download and install new firmware for free, basically all they're doing is baiting you to buy ... and buy again."
3,For school only...,"The only reason I got this book is because I am a student in ASL. If you do not have a teacher to explain things to you, or you already know ASL Grammar, this book is confusing! I do not recommend it. It is written in the 1980's and most of the signs in the book are outdated, and racist. You NEED a teacher to show you the right signs, explain what our doing, and make sure you dont use the racist signs.The pictures are hard to understand.In order to learn ASL well you need to take classes, because there is more to it then just memorizing signs: the grammar, the culture, the community, and so much more."
1,Never Again,I bought this product for my dad in South Africa. Nusrat was one of his favourite artists. Lo and behold when we got there the cd would not play in my dads car (which has a bmw top of the range system in it) but played in all other cars we tried it in (with cheap of market systems in them)I was highly upset because when my dad was so excited when he unwrapped it but now its just to lie in his cupboard because he cant play it.
4,UTFO keep up the great music making,"The last studio album of theirs I believe, but they still have the heat. This is what true rap should sound like!"
5,Texas John,"Mr. Worrall is, in my mind, equal to Patrick O'Brian and even Julian Stockwin. It is refreshing to read about the good old US of A for a change."
3,Less in common with O'Brien than Forrester,"Read this because someone somewhere suggested he was a peer to O'Brien. Unlike O'Brien, he makes the main character sort of a modern sensitive guy in historical drag, as Hornblower is -- squeamish about the same facts of life that the average NPR listener would be if transported back in time. O'Brien provides a luxurious abundance of narrative -- this book is not comparable. There's no shame in falling short of such an achievement, BTW, but prospective readers deserve to know. O'Brien fans might check out Dorothy Dunnet's Lymond series in lieu of this one -- 250 years earlier and not about sailing except incidentally, but as readable as O'Brien and more rewarding from a ""literary"" angle."
3,Disappointing,"I found this sequel to be quite disappointing. In fact it turned Charles Edgemont into a henpecked husband who allowed his wife to become ""The Captain."" I have nothing against strong women, but one who travels such a great distance in time of war just so she can conceive is ludicrous. I read these type of stories for the action at sea and this book let me down.Also I found the introduction of Aubrey and Hornblower (plus his own family name) to be disingenous. And why not Richard Bolitho while he was at it? Maybe he's being saved for another sequel. Stick to the war, Mr. Worrall, and let Penny be strong at home where she can do some good, including the mill and her other improvements. It seemed to me that for an avowed Quaker, she certainly seemed to demonstrate a great deal of pride."
3,2nd stroller,"Got this stroller mostly for inside (mall) use. Love the weight, the easy open and close, the extended visor/cover, and the look of it. Sometimes it won't turn properly, though; and there is really not much use for the basket underneath. When baby was small, head rest was awesome!"
4,Great Stroller!,"The Combi City Savvy All Weather is a great stroller for walks around the neighborhood or a quick trip to the mall. It's light weight and compact. The only problem I have is it can be a little hard to fold up at times. Other then that, it was a great buy and I highly recommend it to anyone!"
5,Combi City Savvy Pink Stroller,"This stroller is very light weight, easy to assemble and adorable. My daughter loves the cup holder, and I like the pockets at the top. It also fold up relatively small, so it's easy to fit in the trunk or back of the SUV. My only complaints are that it is tricky to collapse, and the bottom basket could be a bit larger."
5,A Tribute to the Women Who Have Gone Before,"Merging modern and 19th Century styles, Ms. Huang reminds us our roots lie with those who have gone before and sacrificed to make us who we are. Her work is a tribute to the many women who have gone before, unrecognized for their struggles. It offers peace in a time that threatens our very being. It is time to enjoy the pleasures of good music. As Joachim Berendt said in the title of his book: ""Nada Brahma: The World is Sound"" this, and more can be said of Ms. Huang's work. ""A Woman's Journey"" is sound and its vibration is changing the world in ways of peace and love."
5,Everyone in our family love Yiling's music!,"Everyone in our family love Yiling's music. I listen to this CD in my car, on the way to work, on going home. The soothing music make the worse traffic seem tolerable.Our son Andrew listens to her music going to sleep every night. He said it makes him have good dreams.Thanks for making such beautiful music for all of us.Mike, Maria and Andrew"
2,Disappointing,"This soundtrack was `heart-brokenly' disappointing to me mainly because it lacks a few songs that were in the film. I bought this soundtrack for one specific song (and it would've been worth every penny if only it was included): the song near the end when Alexander marches through the desert to return home to Babylon after his recovery. Such a disappointment that wasn't included.In the other hand, I'm satisfied with some of the tracks that were included. I particularly liked ""Roxane's Veil"" even though I don't recall hearing it in the film."
2,The score is as bad as the movie,"This score, with its relentless choral doublings and lack of any counterpoint whatsoever, is added to mismatched spoken accents to make this one of the absolute worst films of all time.The music is uninspired, insipid, amateurish and deserving of its fate...to be heard very little in the future.Best avoided."
2,Nothing Compared to Troy,"Teyo is SO much better as a soundtrack because...They have fighting (no way!!!) that lasts as long as the songs, it isnt two minutes of fighting(cool!!!)and then he looks at his boy friend for ten minutes(cool???) while music plays making it even wierder since man love is wrong and evil. Plus Troy is a better MOVIE, the best movie of all time in my opinion."
1,Vangelis,"My god, this soundtrack sucks. Big time. I constantly thoughd Gerard Depardieu would pop up from behind the Phalanx. This score is no-more of a remix of 1492: Conquest of Paradise. As a special feature on the game Alexander you get a very disapointing interview with Vangelis. The bottomline is: ""i did the previous movies well, so people will like watever crap I trow at them too"".As a Alexander fan, I am ashamed. Unless you want a nicelooking frisbee, dont buy this. There are better scores."
3,"""1492 Conquest of Paradise"", Blows this Soundtrack AWAY My Friends !!!!","I TOTALLY AGREE W/ THE OTHER REVIEWER ON HERE THAT 1492 IS THE PINNACLE OF VANGELIS BEST MOVIE SOUNDTRACK WORK !!! I HAVE A LOT OF VANGELIS CD'S AND 1492 AN THEMES ALWAYS INSPIRE LIKE NO OTHER SYNTH COMPOSER OUT THERE, SORRY JEAN MICHELE JARRE YOUR CLOSE BUT NO DICE MY FRENCH FRIEND !!! TIMEPIECES BY VANGELIS IS A GOOD STARTING POINT TOO, FOR NEWBIES TO THIS GENIUSE'S WORKS...AU REVOIR"
4,Never judge a soundtrack by its movie,"One of the few noteworthy things about the movie ALEXANDER was its soundtrack. Unfortunately, the movie itself was a flop. It was overdone and the pacing of it was awful. But, fittingly, the soundtrack was written by a Greek - Vangelis. As he usually does with soundtracks, he did a terrific job.There are some very fine moments in this soundtrack. In the phrases I can feel the passions & ambitions of young Alexander. I would like to think it encapsulates the very best moments of the movie. As someone who has studied the life of Alexander in-depth, I would like to think that the Macedonian himself would have approved of this soundtrack, if not the film!"
1,Waste of money!,"This soundtrack is terrible, and I have loved most of Vangelis work for more than twenty years. The only good cut is ""Titans"" dont waste time on the rest."
1,Why Vangelis...?,"Typical Vangelis. Incessant, unfortunately. I disagree with reviewer G.M.Stathis who said, ""...no one has any accurate idea of what music in Alexander's tent may have sounded like..."" Alex Kharlamov, the creator of the music album ""Alexander the Great: Posa Somata, Posa Pneumata"" seemed to have a very good idea, or educated speculation that is shown very well on his album (highly recommended, by the way, as a non-commercial alternative to Vangelis' CD)."
4,Probably one of the best scores from Vangelis,"Althought this is probably not the best film score composed by Vangelis, there's no doubt that it's one of the best, mixing moments of relaxation with other emphatic ones. Even if we haven't seen the film, we'll be able to imagine many moments in the Alexander's odissey just closing our eyes and leaving our mind being driven by Vangelis. Only a Greek could have written a music for the most famous Greek of all times :) Obviously, depending on your own expectations about the music for a film like this, you may like or dislike this soundtrack, but I think it clearly makes a not so good film more enjoyable, and contributes to create the epic and intimate atmosphere that Oliver Stone's film has tried (with different results) to transmit to spectators."
5,A fine filmscore,"A new Vangelis album is always something to be savoured, and a new filmscore especially so, as it is something of a rarity these days. Fortunately, Vangelis does not disappoint, and he has created a wonderful collection of tracks to accompany the film of the same name. The music is in a variety of styles, from quiet, thoughtful pieces to very multi-ethnic tracks, to the most amazing drums of ""The Drums of Gaugamela."" My favourite track, however, is the main theme, ""Titans"" which is Vangelis at his very best: a highly memorable, melodic piece which cannot help but bring the film to life. Vangelis fans are unlikely to be disappointed, and this soundtrack is surely a contender for Best Film Score in the next Oscars.A highly enjoyable CD, and one that I take great pleasure in highly recommending."
4,Alexander review,If you want to chill out and relax this CD can make you relax as it takes you back in time to 2400 B.C. when Alexander the Great lived. Very atmostpheric.
3,An Uneven Effort,"Many of these tracks are quite good and beautiful to listen to, esp. the aforementioned Drums of Gaugamela, which I quite enjoyed. However, much of the score lacks depth. The worst track, and frankly, the one track that ruined the score for me, is Eternal Alexander. It would have been better titled ""Alexander Graduates from High School."" I fully expect everyone in the movie to be wearing mortarboards when I get the DVD.I don't think this score can hold a candle to Vangelis's Chariots of Fire and Bladerunner soundtracks. He ought to listen to those a little more before his next attempt."
2,Vangelis is loosing his touch,"Vangelis has returned to writing soundtracks, but gone are the days of Chariots of Fire, Bladerunner, 1492,and even Antarctica and some other documentaries soundtracks.I haven't seen the movie, the music doesn't stand alone.I founs some years ago, a disk called ""Alexandros"" by another Greek composer called Stamatis Spanoudakis, which is much more inspiring and beautiful.In the last years, Vangelis has lost his magic-starting with the bombastic and boring Mythodea, and now Alexander.It's a pity, let's hope we will see a comeback of one of the masters of electronic music."
5,Simply Amazing Music!,"This album is simply the best sound track! The music is splendid, rich, and deeply touching. I love both the movie and the music; every time I listen to the music, it brings the images of the epic battles and journey of Alexander immediately back to my mind and as if they are happending in front of my eyes."
3,Teen Horror,"Being the new kid in a boarding school and knowing no one can be scary enough without adding in mysterious disappearances and suicide. Unfortunately, Brittany Corin is faced with both. Her close mouthed stance regarding her past began as a way of shielding herself and her troubled past from scrutiny, but rumors are even worse than the truth, and then people begin disappearing, and being Miss Enigma makes Brittany a suspect in the mystery. She is even more so when her name is cited as the culprit in a suicide note. Forced from her solitude to clear herself of the accusations, Brittany must save herself and her classmates from a devilish nightmare that can use her own darkness against her as its chief weapon.*** Subtle horror and Dante inspired images interweave with the ordinary to crescendo in a psychological nightmare that has a message for those who have ears to hear. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
5,Superchick~Karaoke Superstars,I loved this cd the first time I heard it and still do.They have original and punk up-beat sound.Also check out Hero(red pill mix)From last one picked.This is the best song they have.
4,You don't have to be Christian to enjoy this album!,"I heard the song ""One Girl Revolution"" in a movie and immediately got this album, not knowing that Superchic[k] was a Christian band. All of the songs were so upbeat and great to sing along to that I couldn't take it out of my stereo. Aside from the obvious ""Help Me Out God"" and ""Barlow Sisters"", most of the songs just are catchy tunes about being positive and leading a moral life. I love this cd and I am not religious at all. Every song makes me want to sing out loud and dance around the room!"
5,Thumbs Up from Al Menconi Ministries,"This band is self described as ""Just your average girl-fronted, pop-punk, hip-hop, disco-funk, garage band, with something to say and pyro to prove it."" While that may be a little hard to swallow, this group is definitely catchy and their mission is to be a positive influence and role model for teen girls. In a world that is saturated by sultry, too-young-to-be-sexy, girl role models, Superchick is a welcome relief. Fans of most popular rock music will dance to this one."
4,Fun for Old Folks Too,"Though the disk has an obvious youth appeal, it's simply a fun collection of tunes. ""Get up"" is a motivational tune to keep going despite failures--useful for anyone dealing with old demons or new endeavors. ""Let it be"" is perhaps the most unusual cut, relying less on gimmicks and more on vocals than the other songs.There's some wit here that could be used more often. A song on the the fantasy nature of television--TV Land--suggests that ""sometimes you have to choose between real and plastic surgery."""
4,Not only for the relgious,"Well I had been hearing the song ""One Girl Revelution"" a lot so I decidedd to check out the cd. Well I go in to the store look around and can't find. So I ask someone. They tell me it is the christian chilrdren section. I am like umm ok thanks. I go and get the cd but I am thinking: WHAT????? So I get the cd and it turns out to be really good. I don't like Help Me out God but all the others are great. Even though I can't relate to all the lyrics some of them like Big Star Machine and Karaoke Superstars are awesome. This CD is worth the money even if you aren't Christian or relgious at all."
5,Never listened to the c.d. but...,"never listened to this cd before, but i DID see them in concert and i must say that they ROCKED in concert. i also had the privelige of talking to one of the bandmembers and he was very nice. i also plan on getting the cd very soon."
3,Bellini & Sutherland,What you can hear (and it's not too well) is Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne singing up a storm. It's too bad that the quality of the reproduction is relatively poor. You can hear the audience applause quite well! But I would assume that this whole opera would sound better on earphones without distracting noises. But for about $12 bucks it was worth it.
2,Very poor quality recording,The quality of this recording is just terrible. Muffled sound as if singing is done in a room next door. Nothing makes up for this shortcoming. Live performances do not need to sound this way at all. Just sloppy technique.
3,All Music Guide,"Scott Gordon and his friends do a credible job of presentingthe material within a jazz framework.The playing gets engaging and, once in a while, eye opening.Gordon has a way of shifting his style, sometimes during the same song.""Fly Me to the Moon"" has Eddie Duchin segueing to Erroll Garner and back again.A couple of the tracks are significantly enhanced by the appearance of special guests. River Tobias' harmonica adds just the right doleful touch to ""Stardust,"" and Tony La Vorgna's alto sax makes ""Misty"" a premier track.Gordon's appealing laid-back, sensitive piano technique which makes such tunes as ""These Foolish Things"" and ""More Than You Know"" eminently listenable."
3,OK,"I was inspired to buy this book after hearing Jim Clayton speak at a conference to Mobile Home Investors. I was encouraged by his talk of integrity in the workplace with employees and customers. However, in the book I was saddened by the fact that he was divorced TWICE because of both his wives being neglected. He explained in the book that if a Clayton Home customer had a problem they would do whatever it takes to make them a happy customer. I guess that does not apply to his personal life. I realize that he could have omitted the divorce details from his book and to his credit he did not say anything negative about his ex-wives except that the divorces were expensive.I give this book 3 stars because I believe a business owner could learn alot from Jim Clayton but we all need to make sure our wives and children are held in higher esteem than our careers."
2,a disappointed kansan,"I've just read Janice Graham's ""Sarah's Window,"" which I find to be a disappointing portrait of the Flint Hills, where I happen to live. I'm familiar with many of the places mentioned in the book -- I've visited the house where Susan and John supposedly live and I've eaten at the Cassoday Cafe. Graham is inconsistent in her depiction of the people of the Flint Hills. When we first meet Billy, for example, he speaks like a cowpoke; within two pages, his vocabulary has shifted to that of an intellectual. You'll find both types in the Flint Hills, but you likely won't find such drastic shifts in the same person. I know a university professor who's an expert on Flint Hills cowboy folklore, but his vocabulary and demeanor are consistent, unless he's in character to tell a story. For those of us who know the places -- and some of the people -- Graham is presenting, I think she's done a disservice to her readers who think she has captured this unique part of the world."
2,The Bridges of Chase County,"Other reviewers mentioned the intriguing cover. Yes, it is (both versions I've seen), which proves the adage you can't judge a book by its cover. This novel started with a promise but soon grew stale, soap opera, unlikeable characters, a throw-away child, and by midway through, simply boring. The author used a distracting and annoying mixed point-of-view, even within the same paragraph, and a poor use of dialogue structure. Characters smiled, grinned, laughed their lines. One can't smile, grin, laugh a sentence.Disappointing."
3,so close............,"I found this book in a small bookstore and it captured my attention immediatly. The cover art coupled with the outline of the story sounded perfect. I will say that through most of the book, I was captured. I loved the characters, the story line and it was well written. It was one of those books that I would grab every spare second I could find to just stay with this story.Unfortunatly, I was very disappointed in the ending.Afetr developing characters and a storyline that was plausable, the ending went offto, what I feel, a very unbelievable ending. I hate to say that but I feel that I must. I will be looking forward to the next story by Ms. Graham as I saw so much potential in this book. I am glad that I read the story but have a secret wish, that ten years from now the story might end in a more believable way. Sorry"
2,A good story,"Althought I preferred her first book Firestarter, this is a good book, with a good story."
1,Defective Design,"This item, produced and marketed exclusively for the iAudio X5, is entirely useless. The carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself. The ONLY way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors. Even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iAudio into the tiny case, the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger. I returned mine immediately. If you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed, ill-fitting, unacceptable piece of worthless junk."
5,What a treasured gift!,My daughter received this book from my parents on the day she was born. This book offers a wonderful message. We all should have received such a book when we were children. I will be reading this to my daughter often in the years ahead to remind her of the message it sends. I will also be giving this book as a gift to all of my friends with children!
5,Beautiful Thoughts Beautiful Gift,"I stumbled across The Twelve Gifts of Birth when researching ideas for decorating our playroom. Someone had actually used a passage from this book on the wall of a child's room. When I looked for the book online and found out more about it, I ordered it immediately. The book is beautifully illustrated. I will probably give it as a baby gift from now on. The book focuses on all of the positive traits that every child is born with and inspires your heart to look for and appreciate those traits in all children - not just your own."
5,What a beautiful book!,"I bought this book when I was pregnant with my twin daughters. It is a gift from me to them (when they get older I will share it with/give it to them). It holds a very powerful meaning for me. I read the book through tons of tears and when finished, wrote a message from my heart on the inside cover to my unborn girls. Now that they are here (8 months old) I want them to be all this book mentions and more.The author says it all so beautifully and this is just such a wonderful book...a must have for any parent who wants the world for his/her children!"
3,Beautiful book teaching dignity & self-worth of each child.,Beautiful prose and art work make this book a special one for all children. This is a great book to teach children of all ages their own dignity and self-worth. It will touch your soul with it's sincerity and simplicity.
5,The Twelve Gifts of Birth,"Charlene Costanzo is AMAZING for putting what every mother feels, into words. Thank you for writing such an incredibly smart, well-written book... ....and now find myself ordering 13 copies for our niece, nephews, Godchildren, AND our other two children....I want each of our three children to have his/her own copy. What simple lessons we can learn from this and what life-long lessons for our children to know....you are a wise woman....I'm thrilled to find your treasure....thank you so much. -Donna Campbell"
5,Great message for all ages,This is a great book for everybody! It really gets to the heart of what is important in life and in a child. I received it as a gift and now I give it as a gift whenever I get the chance. It is perfect for the child in all of us.
5,The gift book that keeps on giving!,"The Twelve Gifts of Birth is one of those books that I keep referring to over and over again. Not only for myself but as a gift book for friends and clients. Charlene Costanzo has a magical and simple way of reminding us of our inherint gifts of strength, beauty, courage, compassion, hope, joy, talent, imagination, reverence, wisdom, love and faith. Within just a few moments of connecting with this sweet and inspiring tale, people (of all ages) will instantly connect or reconnect with how amazing they truly are!"
2,Doesn't come close to OOTP,"Well, I wonder why people put Baseball Mogul in the same league as Out of the Park Baseball or Season Ticket Baseball. OOTP is so far superior that it's almost frightening. Baseball Mogul is a nice little game, but it lacks key features, for example the ability to actually manage games and there is no online league support. Also, the point system instead of $$ gets boring fast. OOTP 4 will be released March 1st at ..., and it will blow Baseball Mogul out of the water. No competition. None at all. OOTP 3 was already better (by far)."
3,Concept is fascinating; scholarship needs work,"In reading just the first chapter of the book online, I was intriqued by the scope of the book because my family, like the Oates, came to Alabama in the early 1800s. However, as a fifth-generation Alabamian, I was dismayed at the oversights in geography and history. Perry refers to the ""Louisana-Florida line"" and New Orleans being the first city in the South. It's one thing to interpret the events of history or to have opinions on history, but the facts of history should not be changed. Maybe he just needed a better editor."
2,for those more advanced look elsewhere,"This book would be good for those who are just starting to learn about their knees. Basic exercises that are best for a fairly severe knee injury. Examples of stretches and a plan + other background info you can read in any review. Not enough for me. Proprioception = standing on one leg eyes open or closed.Quadriceps = isometric lifing of the leg in a laying down position. And suggestions for slowly building up endurance again through walking, biking etc.For someone already active looking to recover from a slight injury that has not totally debilitated you, hire a personal trainer to work with you in training all your muscles back to good form while using proper positioning to reduce further injury. Would not buy again."
5,Good advice,"My wife just had a hip replacement. Due to her arthritic knees, recovery was difficult (21 steps to get up to our condo). Strong knees make for a speedier recovery. If you take nothing else from this book, the exercises to strenghten quadraceps are invaluable. Strong quads are essential to taking some of the pressure off of arthritic knees."
3,More about if you have problems than preventitive,I was looking for something to help me have stronger knees when I play tennis. This book is more about repairing damage than doing preventive work to increase your strength and ward off injury. I guess its not a bad book but wasn't applicable to my needs.
4,Treat Your Own Knees,"I haven't started doing any exercises but I can tell they will work based on past experience. My orthopedist told me to stop doing knee curls and gave me a couple of exercises to do, those are in here plus more, plan on sharing with my sister."
5,Treat Your Own Knees,This is a great place to start if you have knee injury or wish to improve strength and flexibility. It is short enough to not get you bogged down in jargon and to get through quickly (enabling you to put the routine and advice into action) yet has enough information and advice to improve most problems you are likely to experience with your knees. Well worth a read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
4,Good but,Great info but the text is just too small. Would have also liked more photos or diagrams. Good book overall.
5,Great book,I have read many things about knee treatment having suffered from arthritis now for a few years. This is a straight forward book with great and easy to do exercises. I cannot wait to get started. Seeing my doctor next week and plan on sharing it with him.
5,Help heal yourself.,"I have had 16 years of knee pain originally brought on from a heavy knock to the knee and then exasperated by basketball and a lack of knowledge of how to solve the problem. This book helped almost immediately, with excellent detail and practical activities to treat the various aspects of knee health. I have had some great physiotherapists but even the best of them couldn't explain the detail in easy to understand terms like this book did. Furthermore, the practical activities can be implemented quickly into your daily routine. It may be the best ten dollars you ever spend if you have knee pain, just because it should limit your the time you spend waiting in a physiotherapists office."
3,98 pages too many yet left me wanting more,"After reading the reviews and suffering from knee pain, I decided to buy this book. My expectations were pretty high since all of the reviews were glowing. Perhaps that's where I went wrong.I was expecting a series of ailments and exercises to help alleviate them. Instead you get one strengthening exercise, a few stretches, one prioperception exercise and a recommendation for some endurance exercise. All of this could have fit onto a single sheet of paper.Sure the discussion of the studies is interesting but it really doesn't help me treat my knees. By taking the step of buying the book, I already had commited to wanting better knees and the author didn't need to convince me to do exercises or stretch.All in all, it was a quick read and at ~$10, was less than most people pay for a co-pay. I'd recommend it if you want some general information about knee health and studies but not if you are looking for rehab exercises to get better knees."
4,Simply great,"For all who want to be up-to-date in relation to cardiovascular disease and the mechanisms underlying, this can be a reference manual."
1,Poor workmanship,"The set looks and feels cheap. The metal part that is sandwiched between two plastic covers protrudes out, so the handle is not smooth and you can feel the metal part when you are holding a utensil. I returned this set."
2,Poor quality,"Given the price, I expected something better. The construction is poor: the plastic handles do not align with the metal part, some off by 1mm. The handle also looks cheaply made. Another thing, the so called ""White"" color should be really ""Gray"" which looks awful."
5,Class Flatware,"I've owned this stainless steel flatware for nearly ten years in several different colors. It looks today as new as the day I bought it. It washes beautifully, with a nice shine, and is practically indestructible. I bought the red to have a nice splash of holiday color against the white tablecloth. The white is especially elegant. This type of flatware is reminiscent of what we had when I was a kid. Actually, the knives are about perfect to me. The stainless steel is hard, so I've never had a problem cutting through anything. Very retro and practical.... love it."
5,Great product,Looking for replacement flatware and this really fills the bill. I had lost silverware and I was looking for pieces to go with it. This was the product I was looking for.
5,Good product!,"Very pleased with this set replacing our worn-out/faded one. Weight and quality is good, and so is color. I'd recommend it."
1,Poorly made Flatware,"I received the twenty piece Le Prix flatware set today and I was greatly disappointed. Right out of the packaging a few of the grips were scratched and the finish on the handles look like they were put together in a rush. One of the spoons rivets and the little metal pieces(they were supposed to hold together)actually fell apart as soon as I took it out of the plastic. I will return these immediately and look else where for my flat wear.Ginkgo Le Prix Black 20-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 4"
5,Classic & solid quality,"Clean, classic, beautiful, and strong. I'm really pleased with this set and I'm sure it's going to last for years."
3,It's good but I expected more from DMX,"I'm the type who listens to rappers that actually say something. Of course X's album was John Blaze when I first heard it. But after a while, I was searching for the message. DAMIEN, HOW'S IT GOIN' DOWN, and THE CONVO are some good tracks. I think his beats coulda been betta, and he coulda rhymed more about something, anything for the remaing 12 songs-as he did in the 3 songs stated. And for those who think he trynna be like PAC, get real!! Nobody can fill that man's shoes, and all these rappers know that. Phuck what ya heard, BIGGIE wasn't even coming close to PAC."
5,WHERE MY DOGS AT CAUSE I GOTTA TELL THEM TO BUY THIS !!!,"YO DMX IS THE BEST RAPPER SINCE BIGGIE!HE GOT THE LYRICS AND THE BODY!!!!! SO IF YOUR READING DMX YOR HOT ,THE BOMB,AND HOT WITH A BODY TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU DMX!!!!!!!!!!"
4,DMX is the Bomb!,DMX is the man and I am definitely happy with my purchased. His flows and music make him a complete artist. Their hasn't been an artist with this much feeling since Tupac. It's the Ruff Ryders' Anthem Baby!
5,DMX ROCKZ DA HOUSE!!!!!,"DMX is quite possibly one of the key playaz on the Rap scene at this point in time, therefore I believe: HE BE ROCKIN THIS JOINT! OH BABY HE IZ OFF THE HOOK!"
5,HIP HOP in full effect,DMX COMES OFF WITH A ROUGHNESS AND STYYLE THAT JUST STARTS ME TO GET HYPED NOT IN A NEGATIVE WAY IM 32 AND IT MAKES ME WANT TO GET AT YA DAWG
4,Most authentic rapper to hit the scene since Rakim,This guy is the real deal. This review was submitted prior to the actual album release but you can rest assured that the album comes correct! DMX expresses the angst and rage that much of black america feels be we middle class or street.On all of his collaborations that raw energy of his is captivating. And you will believe what he's telling you. So many rappers today sound so ingenuine.Rap has been corrupted by corporations and acceptance by the mainstream. It's a real pleasure to hear something so raw. I just hope somebody's listening.
3,Classic DMX,"This is and will always be a classic DMX joint. Love it. Get it and you will too. Another great artist, albeit a bit vulgar at times. Sick beats and rythm."
5,DMX is one of a kind,"I really enjoy DMX, his style is awesome and unique. I do not mind the graphical lyrics on the other hand my son loves DMX and he is only ten years old. I am glad to see that they have the edited version for sale so all ages can enjoy his music. Thank You for thinking of our children. Rosa Milbourne"
5,Great book,I bought this book for my two-year old because he became fascinated by dinosaurs. He absolutely loves this book. It captivated him right from the start. The story rhymes well and the pictures are eye catching.
5,Very Cute Book!,"This may sound funny from a nine year old, but I do have this book! My favorite dino in it was the Velociraptors and the Iguanodons. Cute story for young dino fans!"
3,"Fun, But Could Be More Adjustable","I received this as a present, and was quite thrilled. It is a quirky and fun ring, however I have small fingers (Size 5-6) and when I tried to adjust the ring by squeezing it to fit, it felt like the ring was going to snap. I recommend this ring, but feel that it is better suited for Size 7 and larger, hence the lower rating."
2,What???,Could not follow through with any kind of plot. Could not watch more then half way as to boring of a story.
5,Fun!,"The wheel was a lot of fun! I use it with Destruction Derby 64, and Beetle Racing. It works great. The only problem with it was the ""Built in Force Pak"", it stunk, you could hardly feel it. It's definately worth the money though."
1,Disappointed,I ordered this product to use with Mario Kart and was very disappointed. The delay between turning the steering wheel and the on screen reaction was so slow that it was useless. I would not recommend the product for use with this game.
4,Great material but the sizing may be off?,"This shirt is very cute. It's a super stretchy material which is good. I ordered a Medium, and it seems a bit small to be a medium. It's very stretchy though, so i doubt there will be a problem! It's adorable and I love it."
3,POIROT. MOVIE COLLECTION,I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER. I LOVE POIROT BUT EACH TIME WE ARE CONNED BY ACORN MEDIA.I LAST ORDERED NO 3 MOVIE COLLECTION ONLY TO FIND THE 3 DVDS ARE REPEATS OF OTHER SERIES JUST NEW PRESENTATION. SURELY AMAZON HAVE ENOUGTH CLOUT TO STOP THIS. PLEASE INSIST THE TITLES AS IN PREVIOUS SERIES ARE INDICATED ON THE FRONT COVER OR INDICATED IN YOUR ADVERT. THIS HAPPENS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. ITS NOT FAIR TO YOUR CUSTOMERS YOU WONT LOSE OUT AS WE WILL STILL BY ALTERNATUIVE DVDS I DONT WANT TO PURCHASE THE REMAINING ONES OF THE SERIES AS I KNOW THEY WILL BE REPEATS. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS FRAUD. MIDSOMER MURDERS IS ANOTHER CASE I HAVE 80 EPISODES PURCHASED FROM YOU AT LEAST 20 ARE REPEATS IN DIFFERENT PRESENTATION COVER.
2,Poirot Set two,Very disappointed because there were not capations! series two. I am very hard of hearing. I assumed when I bought it that it would have the captions
2,"Avoid Unless You Are A ""Smooth Jazz"" Fan","I like Federici's work with other bands and was expecting something with more bite than this. I suppose that it is fine for what it is, but it is pretty light stuff. I know that some people really like this kind of mood music (after all, Kenny G. seems to sell a lot of CDs) but it is too much like elevator music to appeal to me. It is all background music, mostly mid-tempo tunes with no edges. A one time listen for me."
1,this is absolutely awful,"This album is so bad. I think it might be one of the worst things I've ever listened to. Don't listen to this, ever! Stay away."
5,Manna Pro Moultrie Deer Corn Supplement,"I don't really love this product but the deer,squirrels and birds do. I got it because the deer started eating the bird seed at my feeder and while they still come to the feeder, just when I forgot to put the corn out for them."
1,"Product corrupts drives, tech support has very long wait","I bought this product, and it corrupted the first drive within 48 hours. While waiting for a drive replacement, the second drive was corrupted, and all the data was lost. Buffalo Technical Support line waiting time was always in the 45-60 min range. Replacement was sent to me (but returning the old unit is at my cost). New drive also has a disk error within less than 48 hours from arrival. Do yourself a favor, and look elsewhere!"
2,Crashed on me,"Never thought it would crash in 15 days of running. Lost 2 days worth of business data. Customer support was great. Had it been Dell, I would have been **** out fo luck. Buffalo support stuff stayed with me over 1.5 hrs to walk me through the whole nightmare. If you consider this product, please, back up everything, and upgrade the firmware ASAP. Now 4 months later, running perfectly, with the new firmware. By the way, do not use the default RAID configuration, change it to RAID 1."
5,Another fine rameau outing for Mcgegan,"This is another in a series of Rameau opera and ballet recordings Nicolas McGegan with the Philharmonia Barqoue orchestra. They all are played with verve, attention to detail and flawless execution. Plus, (and this is a little less tangible, I admit) they are imbued with a certain joie de vivre and sense of humour that seems to belie the image of the dour authentic instrument groups that take themselves a wee bit too seriously."
1,terrible,"This book is terrible. It shows karate techniques for most of the book,and the rest is about samauri sword fighting and a large section on the so- called ""ninja death touch"". For real ninja I reccomend Stephen Hayes' 5 book series starting with ""The Spirit of the Shadow Warrior""."
1,Masanari needs to read his history books,"Masanari needs to read his history books before he lectures on what the origins of a whole society of people is. The book was well writen. Thats the only good I can say about it. Of ninjutsu there is no sign but the word. Taijutsu is a way of moving the body in a natural way. Ashida/Hunter (same person) Holds a karate stance and flexes his fingers. If you trained that way, you'd have arthritus within the week.No, ninjutsu is not only taijutsu. It encompasses many things. among them, Ninpo, Mikkiyo, as well as servival techniques. Ninjutsu is a way of life, but it is not include Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Dim Mak, etc.. Ninjutsu is an Art, not a combination of arts. You cannot have an art who's birth came before the invention of its components!Masanari read a book written by some one who is not trying to make money off of you. Visit the Japanes Ninja History Musems.They're Awsome"
4,"Good reference, but only need to read the first few chapters","The author does a good job of establishing a framework for thinking about pricing in the first chapter of the book, then expands on that framework over the first few chapters. Like most business books, however, the deeper into the book you get the less valuable it becomes. Definitely worth buying, but you'll get 90% of the value from the first few chapters"
3,A little bit overpriced,"I was really curious about this book, but it did seem to be expensive. However, I decided to buy it and here are some thoughts:You may find some different points of view whether you should use: a low cost strategy or differentiation. This part was interesting.As you continue reading the book, information becomes a little more hard to understand. This may not be a good option for students of first year of university. If you have a degree in Economics or Business then you should be able to follow the author.There are parts that are not really practical. Information also becomes redundant. Sometimes I felt that the author had one good idea that could have been explained in 100 pages, but he forced it to 350+ pages.I haven't been able to finish reading the whole book as it became boring. As I said previously there is too much repetition.I would have given this book 5 stars if the content was precise and ""priced"" at a better price (maybe $25 USD)."
1,Very hard to read - boring and not very concise,Very hard to read - boring and not very concise. I had to purchase this for my class. Would not recommend this to anyone
3,Incorrect Product Description - Not 18/10 Sterling,"I just received my flatware set, and was very disappointed to find that clearly written on the packaging it states ""surgical stainless steel"". This is most definitely NOT 18/10 stainless, as advertised (and confirmed by the magnet test). I wrote to the supplier and asked them to amend their online description, but as yet, it's still being advertised as 18/10.Altho not 18/10, I will be keeping the set, as I need silverware and had limited time to find something, and the price was right for a 12-serving set. It did arrive quickly, and was packaged very well (each piece individually wrapped and in dividers within a 'briefcase'). The weight of the cutlery is nice, and the pieces feel good in the hand.It is attractive, but how it holds up to use and dishwasher wear is yet to be seen."
1,Don't be fooled!,"Don't be fooled by the pictures or the product description. This flatware set is NOT ""heavy gauge"" and is far from ""high quality"". Not only does it take weeks to arrive the briefcase the flatware comes in looks nothing like the picture. When I opened the shipping box and slid it out of the plastic I was alarmed with how much dust covered the product! My palms and finger tips were black after handling it. If that experience wasn't bad enough once I opened the briefcase (which was broken and missing parts that were not in the shipping box so I assume it sent that way) I could have cried(this item was a Christmas present for my mother-in-law and the last on my list to wrap and ship off)the large spoons were the size of a serving spoon! The ""gold trim"" is not noticeable and the flatware is just that, flat, cheap, and flimsy! I would not spend $25 at a flea market for this product! The seller has no respect for it's customers and the product is not worth the time, money and aggravation!"
1,Crappy Flatware,"The ad said this is 18/10 flatware. It feels decent but is by no means heavy or sturdy.The gold color is coming off and staining the flatware.It arrived in a VERY moldy smelling case. (Smells so bad I threw it away!!)It would be fine it the ""gold"" wasn't ""melting"" off. If it was just a chrome finish, it would be a decent value. I really doubt the 18/10 claim!!!!What did I expect for $79??"
4,like it enough,"Kind of glad for the stainless steel, can wash in machine. Love the soup spoon size as most tablespoons are so small now, these were perfect and reminded me of the ones I grew up with."
5,Teenage Wasteland,"""The Every Boy"" recalls the trials and tribulations of a boy's adolescence, the ups and downs of relationships with family and friends, and a battle for attention. I was slowly sucked into a world just like my own, where everything isn't always perfect. Anger, sadness, and complete happiness are emotions felt as Henry Every's experiences remind us that we are not alone. Through past and present, I saw the mistakes that the characters made and the way they go about trying to fix them. Overall the book was amazing, humorous, and has a plot that will keep your eyes glued to the pages."
5,"Better than ""Salingeresque""","I hope I won't be accused of heresy if I say that Henry Every is more intriquing and more insightful than Holden Caulfield. Having enjoyed Henry so much, I wish he were alive for a sequel. Since that is not the case, perhaps the author will treat his readers to a next book featuring the inimitable Jorden. She is a standout among a cast of well drawn and fascinating characters."
2,"Good start, but went nowhere",1/2 way through reading this book I wondered if the book was going anywhere and what was the point.
2,Chiller + Koozie = Success!,"While the CoolIT Beverage Chiller isn't powerful enough to even keep a drink cool, I found a way to keep my drink cold until I finish it. Get a koozie (foam can holder), cut out the bottom, put it around a soda can and stick the can on the CoolIT chiller. Granted, most of the job is done by the koozie, but near the end of the can, it does make a difference."
1,Eh... waste of money,"The CoolIT USB Beverage Chiller is a great idea with not-so-great execution. It only keeps the bottom part of the beverage cold, and not so much that you would notice a difference. The fan is loud. All-in-all an unimpressive product. I'm sending mine back."
1,Disappointing,"This product doesn't cool enough. It doesn't really keep a beverage cold, let alone cool a warm one. Nice idea, but pass on this one."
1,don't buy this!!!,"This thing is a cool idea but it simply DOES NOT WORK!! I bought this as a christmas present for a friend and I was mortified that it didn't work!! After the holidays, I checked amazon and I saw that there were new reviews (there were none at the time I bought the item) from people that experienced the same thing!Whatever you do, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS."
4,Very cool geek gift,"What to get for the geek who has everything! My husband uses it on his laptop, and every time he does, it makes him giggle :)"
2,Chill It - Luke warm at best,"Great idea that doesn't live up to it's hype. Two issues, it steals the USB ports completely and often causes problems with one's computer. More importantly, it doesn't cool down drinks, or even maintain them. They usually warm up to room temperature within an hour, whether on the coolIT or not. Disappointing performance."
4,"Gimmicky, but works as advertised","Many people complain that this device doesn't take a pot of boiling water and freeze it on your desk. That isn't what it is for. I like drinking cold water at my desk at work, sometimes I have the water there for a while. I figured it would be a fun thing to try. It works, keep my water cold, most definitely colder than leaving it on my desk. My only real complaint is the noise level. It is quiet, but it is designed to be sitting on a desk right next to you so the noise is more noticeable. Personally, I like the gimmicky aspect of this cooler than the actual function. It is a nice conversation piece."
3,Works as advertised but not as well as expected,This product is really neat but only gets down to 45 degrees with optimum conditions (More moisture in the air the better). It will not cool a can of soda or a glass of water very much but will keep a drink cooler longer than sitting on your desk. I tried to cool a glass of water from room temp and after 4+ hours it really didn't seem to make much of a difference. The Glass had good surface contact and temps were measured by a laser point temperature reader. A neat buy for the tech geek but thats about it.
1,doesn't work very well,"I had high hopes for this, but it doesn't work very well. I actually read a product description that claimed it could cool a room temperature drink. HAH! It doesn't even keep cold drinks cool. Plus it gives off a lot of heat from the backside, it might actually make your drink get warm faster, and since it's usb you have to have it fairly near your computer to plug it in, and the computer is giving off mega-heat, so your drink doesn't have a chance."
2,Barely effective.,"At best, this will briefly extend how long a beverage in a can remains cool. It's one of those things you'd probably never buy for yourself, but may be cooler (ha ha) than other gifts you might give someone that they'll never use. Definitely better than a sweater. Also, louder than a sweater, as the fan puts out a decent hum."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I was excited about this product and couldn't wait to get it. Got one on Christmas and well...hmmm. after trying it out a couple days I'm pretty dissapointed. I use it in a USB 2.0 and while the plate is pretty cold, the beverage is not. I tried it in a glass, then in a can thinking the aluminum would conduct the cold better. The difference is almost negligible. It barely keeps an already cold beverage cool...and certainly doesn't cool a room temperature beverage even after sitting on the unit for an hour. It will be somewhat cool if the volume of liquid is very low(an inch or less) A rather neat idea that just didn't totally come to fruition. You're better off just using a beverage cozy."
2,Faulty fan,"These micro fans seem to have problems. I had to replace it already and I have had the same problems in other devices.Otherwise, the device is as advertised."
2,It's Ok,I purchased this as a gift for my dad & it worked alright. The drink really has to be chilled before you use this as it will simply help maintain a cooler temperature for a longer period of time.
4,My father LOVED it!,"I gave this item as a Christmas gift to my techy Dad, and he completely adores it. It does just what it says it will do, safely and efficiently. The only drawback I suppose is that the item drains a lot of power from your comp, so you can't really use it for long periods of time on a laptop not connected to an outlet.I do recommend this item...but possibly also recommend buying a backup battery if you plan to use it away from a plug in power source."
4,Very good beat,The title song of 2 Times has a great beat and anyone who listens seems to sing along. It's one of those songs that you can't wait until you hear it agai.
5,This book took my breath away!,"I loved this book more than any other Historical fiction novel that I've ever read! It is the story of a young black girl who is kidnapped from her home in Africa, and taken on a slave ship to Boston Mass.{They give you a detailed account of how she was caught and her journey} Soon after, she is taken in by the Wheatley family, and treated as a daughter, not a slave. Nathanial, John Wheately's son, teaches her to read and write. The Wheately's soon realize, that she has a great talent for writing poetry! So, they take her to England to have it published.{because she is black and a woman, they won't publish her work in America}. Once in England, Benjamin Franklin tells her that now that she is in England, she is free! So, the question is, will she betray the family that has treated her so well? Or will she take her long wanted freedom?"
5,History made interesting!,"As an 8th grade US History teacher, I find this book a great way to teach about both an individual (Phillis Wheatley) and a specific time period. This biography is well-researched and makes learning about slavery and the revolutionary war a great addition to the history textbook. Phillis Wheatley endures great pain in her young life first being sold as a slave and then spending most of her life proving herself - simply because she is black. At first her goal is to please Nathanial Wheatley whom she adores, but later she comes to terms with learning about herself and where she fits in a world where being black affords very few opportunities. Along with a book of Phillis Wheatley's poems, this is a wonderful book to use in a US History classroom from a variety of perspectives - the slavery issue, African American history, and women's studies."
4,I Loved this book!,"I thought this book was good, but slow. It was rather educational, but in a good way. It would have made a good book to read to learn a little more about the life of african americans in the late 1700's. I thought this book was entertaining and think that many other kids my age would enjoy reading it."
4,Good historical fiction book for middle school students,"As an assignment for an 8th grade English class, this book was both fun and informational..Although I would not read something like this in my spare time, if ya like historical fiction, go for it."
4,Good historical fiction.,It is not that I did not like it but that I could imagine being a woman during the Revolution War peorid.
3,"A fair book, but NOT Ann Rinaldi's best","I've only read four of Rinaldi's many books, yet I can clearly see that this will probably always be among my least favorites.Perhaps it was the harshly realistic fact that Phillis Wheatley was a slave, and thought of by Nathaniel Wheatley and his family as just that, but it could also be that it seems unrealistic for a young slave to love a man (a white man; the son of her master) who always considered her property to be treated as property.Also, it seems out of character for her, a headstrong young woman, to SETTLE for the man she eventually did marry. She seemed to be a somewhat better judge of character than to wed someone of his personality.I wouldn't recommend this work over her others, such as A Break With Charity, The Blue Door, etc."
5,FABULOUS BOOK!!!,"This book is called ""Hang a Thousand Trees with Ribbons"" and is written by the author, Ann Rinaldi.This describes the life of Phillis Wheatley before she becomes a famous poet. Nathaniel, the son of the Wheatley family teaches Phillis how to speak English and how to read.This is ironic, because the daughter Mary, does not know how to read or write. Some of the other slaves are kind to Phillis such as Aunt Cumsee and Prince and others are not so kind such as Sulie. Both Mary and Sulie, in Phillis' opinion are very evil and cruel.When Phillis starts to write poetry she knows that the Wheatley family, besides Mary, supports her and believes that she can do anything, espicially Nathaniel.This book just proves that you can do anything if you put your mind to it."
2,Not enough true facts for me,"I thought the book was very well written, but many facts were not true I found out after doing some reasearch. After I finished reading the book, I had to do a book report while trying to find Pictures of Phillis I ran over other interesting facts such as mary and mrs. wheatley taught her not nathanial. That is why i give it two stars. Not enough true facts for me."
2,Not so good,"I'm a fan of Rinaldi's books, but I was disappointed in this one. Some may like it, but I didn't. The story doesn't GO anywhere...in the beginning she falls in love with her master's son, but marries someone else. It just didn't really ""catch my eye"""
3,Hang a Thousand Trees with Ribbons,"I found this book very interesting. I liked the way that Rinaldi gave us a real taste of Phillis Wheatley. I often feel like you are never able to understand much about historic figures except for the boring facts. Rinaldi does an amazing job of weaving together a story that is fun and amazingly close to reality. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was the fact that the story seemed very long at times. Almost as if Rinaldi was just trying to make the story as long as possible. With that exception, I would happily recommend this book to adults and children."
2,Just as bad...,"Just more of the same on this book. It is just a continuation of his first book, and I found it to be a bit boring. Not recommended by me."
3,Worth reading for insight into the life and thought of Rand.,"Not entirely enthralling; but just the section of letters to and from Frank Lloyd Wright is worth it. Rand wrote to Wright during the writing of and after the completion of The Fountainhead. His initial reaction was curt, bordering on rude. His abrupt turn around after reading the book, though, was fascinating. She developed a brief friendly relationship with him, visiting him at his personal estate, and he even designed a house for her and her husband, which, sadly, was never built. Other selections in this book are valuable for their clarification of her ideas and further elucidations of her novels given in response to inquiring fan letters"
2,Maybe worthwhile for Rand scholars....,"Perhaps I was just coming down off of an Ayn Rand high when I read this, but whatever the case, this collection of correspondance just doesn't deserve a place beside Rand's self-published work, which is in sufficient abundance to make a collection like this unwarranted.If you are thoroughly absorbed into Rand's Cult of Personality (amazingly effective even after her death), then you will probably enjoy this work. There was certainly a time where I would have devoured every letter. If, on the other hand, you have been impressed and affected by The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged, We The Living, or Anthem, I would strongly suggest working through Rand's nonfiction before diving into this book."
4,"Great Book, Great Seller","This product was exactly as seller described. The shipping was also prompt. All-in-all, I would definitely to business again. Thanks!"
1,Doesn't work very well,This latern does not give off sufficient light. I am returning it and purchasing another energizer led that throws off a lot more light!
3,Good for emergency lighting,"After the last Irene and Sandy storm, I bought this as a gift for a friend. It is small, not too heavy but it was not as bright as others Rayovac lantern that I own. Better to pay more for the brighter one."
5,great for light anytime,"This is a light weight handy lantern. we use it to light up our garden at night, or if the power goes out. So handy and easy to use."
3,Lantern,"We had a smaller Rayovac lantern that threw a lot of light for its size. We thought we were ordering the same one. As it turned out, this one is larger, holds the same amount of batteries, and throws less light. It serves our needs though."
4,Not enough light,"I have occasional black outs and wanted a light that could let me do chores. However this lantern gives as much light as a 40 watt bulb. I was hoping it would give me the light that my 60 to 75 watt lamp gives off but it doesn't'Well made strong and trustworthy, It is very durable for the price. I just wish they explained how much light it would give off.I really wanted a lantern that would allow me to read when I lost power and if I am close enough it might allow me to do that.Again very well made, but doesn't give off enough illumination but next time I will buy a latern that gives off at least enough light to read comfortably.A good buy but not enough illumination.RBI geuss the 55 lumens is not all that much.i wonder how many lumens is a 75 watt bulb."
5,Love it!,Wish I'd had this during Hurricane Sandy. It does give off alot of light and is very handy. Easy battery installation. Now I am ready for the next hurricane (oh no).
4,On/Off Switch cheap and unreliable,"Is a good sized lamp and is bright enough to light up a room enough to get around. It won't scare off Shelob, but gets it done. I paid $13 for the lantern, so I had medium expectations given the other solid reviews. My main gripe is that the on off switch sometimes turns the lamp on/off, sometimes it just turns it from off to off. So, some kind of contact problem....but i eventually got the thing working consistently enough. Do not use this as your only lantern. This is a good choice in a portfolio of lanterns for power outages. I would buy it again if I knew what I was getting, but I would not pay $20 or more for it."
2,Not that bright,"Firstly, the lantern arrived broken, with the glass/plastic shattered. Whether or not that effected the brightness, I can't really say. I have other Rayovac products that are great, but not this one."
1,norjon,"I suppose this product will do if you have nothing else, but I think they do not taste very good. Also, they contain sodium caseinate, which I did not know and was trying to avoid. Not suitable for my purposes. I dumped mine in the trash."
4,good,was very good and they did a very good job with getting it to my house i might even buy it again some day to try with my coffee again.
5,Offering Proverbs-based guidelines,"Street-Smart Ethics: Succeeding In Business Without Selling Your Soul is a meaningful guide written by psychologist and corporate consultant Clinton W. McLemore especially for those Christians seeking to prosper in the business world, but not at the expense and pain of others. Offering Proverbs-based guidelines to stay on an honorable path, true-false self-test questions, ethical brainteasers, a solid primer of professional principles for dealing well and fairly with others, Street-Smart Ethics is a practical, balanced, useful, Christian-based ethics instructional guide for doing business in the world."
4,sturdy,"better made than others I've used. I bought this along with some Sparco wall files and the Sparco all showed up broken. This one was thicker plastic, less brittle, and better packaged. It's more expensive than the Sparcos, but now I see why."
3,Good movie,"The movie stars Master Bhagwan, Brahm Bhardwaj, Som Dutt, Rakhee Gulzar, Rajendra Kumar and Pran. Movie starts with a region where a powerful man named Raja Bahadur (Pran) rules over there. He lives a wealthy lifestyle alongwith his brother named Suraj (Rajendra Kumar) who lives abroad due to his studies. He is not a good man as he is alcoholic, womaniser and is also used to live a high profile lifestyle. One thing he knows very well that his days as king are numbered as he is running out of his money. Also he has borrowed money and the creditors are threatening to take him to court. Over all of these things, he also had an affair with a prostitute named Dulari (Kumkum) whome he refused to marry. He had sent her brother named Kundan (Anwar Hussain) to jail.And thus the story goes making it more deep. Overall, Aan Baan is a family drama, which was appreciated by audience and was above average at Box Office."
4,By Far the Most Complete Book on the Subject,"This book explores how lactose can upset the digestive tract and identifies which dairy products that are ""safe"" to eat. The author identifies brand names of lactose reduced milks and who can drink them, warns of lactose containing non-dairy foods and prescription drugs to avoid, provides suggestions for substitute foods and lactase pills, reviews lactose intolerance in infants and children, and explores how lactose intolerance is diagnosed and how to avoid triggering a reaction. By far, the most complete books available on the subject."
3,Half a Loaf Is Better Than None,"More Talkin' Bahamian is a humorous, but information packed dictionary of local vernacular vocabulary of the Bahamas. It is interesting and useful if you hear Bahamian slang and want to know what it means. The definitions are arranged as in a lexicon with some special sections on rules for talking like a Bahamian and Bahamian proverbs and sayings.I think the book would be much more helpful if there were a section to look up words in standard English to see the Bahamian equivalent that the non-Bahamian could be use as he/she spoke."
2,not worth the money,"This cabinet looks really nice on the picture. However, the actual product has a really low quality. There are a lot of defects in the paint (discoloration, etc). The cabinet arrived damaged in several places. The mounting is easy, but not optimal. One can see the mounting elements on the back easily from the side of the cabinet due to the fact that the cabinet does not mount flush to the wall."
2,"Kept it, but wouldn't buy it again.","I found the picture light to be of poor quality, or maybe I just got a bad one. It works and installs easily but all of the joints were loose causing the light to tilt to one side once it was installed. These joints were impossible to tighten so I had to use a tube of glue to keep it straight."
2,Ultra Lighting Cordless Picture Light,"Product is well made, and aesthetically pleasing, but a major draw back is that the level of illumination is insufficient. Having to load up 8 type C alkaline batteries is a also a drag and adds considerable weight to the unit. For a $50 dollar unit one would expect a more thoughtful product that pumps out adequate illumination."
2,Too heavy,"After loading the batteries it was too heavy to mount on the wall, plus the cost to power was just too high. I prefer the one I have that is powered by AAA batteries (not C size). Sent it back."
2,Poor quality pump head construction,"I bought a Sistema Consumer Electric Pressure Washer two years ago. I used it twice and it sat in my garage for two years. When I tried to use it again today, the trigger mechanism no longer works. I then found out from Sistema support that this is caused by internal corrosion of the aluminum pump ahead.This is not a unique problem with Sistema washers. I also observed the same thing on other brand of washers. All these consumer electric pressure washer uses very cheap material for the pump head. If the unit is not to be used for any period time, you should fill the pump chamber with 50/50 antifreeze for aluminum engine. The user manual should have informed the users to do so to prevent corrosion inside the aluminum pump head."
3,Works Well But Suffered a Malfunction,"The pressure washer arrived with some slight shipping damage - hooks for use in coiling up the electrical cord were broken. I thought I could get by without them and didn't want to have to ship the unit back. The second time I used the unit, a switch apparently failed. The pump is supposed to turn on only when the ""trigger"" is pulled, but the pump on my unit ran continously. Now I will have to send it back in. Too bad, because otherwise I really like the pressure washer. It uses very little water and is easy to tote around the house and yard."
4,GOOD LITTLE PRESSURE WASHER,i recieved this pressure washer as a fathers day gift and must say its money well spent.i have used it on my white aluminum deck around my pool to remove built up dirt and must say it did a great job...white deck looks like new. a couple weeks later i used the sistema to remove built up dirt and grime on my aluminum siding..and once again it did a great job. great tool at a great price.
1,Damaged,"Received the unit with two hose holders broken off and another unidentified part broken off as well. The case was cracked. The item had no packing, just everything jammed in a box. The shipping container looked good. This company doesn't seem to care enough about it's product to at least try to pack it properly. Don't have a clue if it works good or not.Amazon as always, did the right thing and allowed me to return the product without a hassle. I give them six stars"
3,This is the best racing game i've ever played!!!!,"This game is DA BOMB! with over 166 cars that i've found I don't understand why Prima is the only company that has made a strategy guide for it. There are more than 166 cars and they are bad! I would like to see all the cars and capabilities of each of them in a well laid out stategy guide before the second one comes out, which is going to be great I know!!"
2,question,"I would gladly pay money or trade my memory card with someone or pay for it , but I badly need a memory card with the A and Intern. A licence daata on it . I had enough trying for it , so please help me out !"
3,learn how to drive,"gt is a simulator not a game. if you know how to drive a car, you shouldnt need a strategy guide. heres a good strategy for you all, drive fast and win the race."
5,savage sets us strait,"michael savage is clearly the most independant talk radio host, as well as author out there. he is the most clear and consise speaker and offers up insightful thinking in times of mass confusion. savage lights the way for the independant and ethical americans we are. congrats to you, savage."
1,The Savage Weiner,"This book proves that any fool can write a book, no matter how hateful or deranged they might be. All they need is a willing publisher. Or enough money to pull it off without one.The fact that slime like Weiner haven't had massive strokesconfining them to sit silently in wheelchairs while their Jamaican nurse watches Wheel of Fortune and ignores them is solid proof of the non-existence of any kind of God.Of course, should such a thing happen to them, it will be proof that there is a God."
1,Counter productive in the 21st century,"I would have given this book no stars, but sadly '0' isn't one of the options.Savage is an attention-getter and shameless self-promoter. Anyone who reads this book with their critical-thinking skills intact, will see what nonsense this is, regardless of political beliefs. He's got his facts wrong in a lot of cases, and doesn't offer workable solutions to his various rants.Ironically, he reminds me of one major thing wrong with America--the rise of the 'pundit class.' All these people who just rant and rave with likeminded people on their shows and on the phones patting each other on the back. The righteous indignation on both sides of the politic fence is [poor].These people should get off their butts and work in their communities to make change instead of talking about what's wrong with the 'other' side's policies."
1,Pretty sad...,"We've heard this kind of reactionary ax grinding before. In this case, it's designed to make the author money by appealing to those who are easily influenced by little more than divisive rhetoric. Save your money for something worthwhile."
1,Savage is a moron,"Give me a break!! He tries to say the media is Liberal, but what do you call Fox News?? He tries to say Liberals are assaulting border control, but Conservatives have done nothing better. This guy is a joke, just like Bill O'Lielly."
1,Are the rumors true?,"There is a rumor going around in some circles that most of the positive review of this book have been posted by Savage himself. A ... self-promoter, Savage pumps his ego into the microphone, stinking up cars and homes across the nation with the nonsense that liberals are taking over this country. Savage plays into the culture of fear like magician Ricky Jay plays poker, straight faced and with a couple of aces up his sleeve. His rants and tirades in the book are to be taken with a grain of salt. Savage seems to be the latest in the ""flavor of the week"" radio hosts, in syndication. Yet he lacks depth and his views are not well defended, except for his ""I'm smarter than you"" attitude. Savage, you can't fool all of the people with your act."
1,Savage and the GOP for Dummies...,"1. It's absolutely essential that... on Nov. 2, we make the right choice, because if we make the wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again and we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States.- Dick Cheney2 Savage's purpose for writing the book is to save a ""homosexualized, feminized America"" from a liberal assault that is ""unraveling the very fabric of this great nation.""- editorial review, Savage Nation3. THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF- Frankin D RooseveltAny questions?"
1,can we say IGNORANT?,"I haven't read this book. I have read the book summary, so you don't have to listen to me.But the summary alone enraged me. Its interesting how a country with a glorious policy of freedom would accept such a book. This author appears to be a prejudice bigot, using his freedom of speech to denounce various minorities. It disgusts me how people like him still exist. I feel sorry for him and the people who follow him. Of course, censorship is wrong, therefore this book should, lawfully, be available to the public. Hopefully we can use books like this, and men like him, to be made an example of how no matter how much we advance and grow and improve, there will always be some people who are blind, ignorant, and sad."
1,Probably the worst book ever written,"Some one has written in a review that Savage (real name Michael Wiener)himself is writing most of the positive reviews here. I couldn't agree more. If you go through the names, you'll see 3 or 4 names appearing over and over again.Besides being a nitwit and an ego-maniac, Savage is also a dishonest self-promoter. What else can one expect from a snake oil salesman who's written a flurry of quack ""herbal science"" books a decade ago?Every page drips with venomous hatred and rudeness and stinks with ego.He's a shame to every group he associates himself with...including humans."
5,Get a copy for you and one for a friend!,"This book should definitely hit home to any clear thinking American. Michael Savage simplifies the major problems facing our country today focussing on the need to save our borders, language, and culture. The book reads very quick and leaves you wanting to hear more (every evening on his fastest growing radio show)."
5,Excellent!,Very good reading on how our nation is falling into the jaws of liberalism. Savage is a excellent new voice in those who want to restore our nation back to one of morals.
4,political awareness,"if for nothing else, this book brings about a mass of questions concerning our government and the politicians in this country. liberals are pigeon holed, but the author offers some back up to the claims. if you were never into politics or really only registered to a political party mainly due to family tradition, this book will make you want to educate yourself more in the constitution and in the science of politics, and awaken the true patriot in all of us by reminding us of the efforts our founding fathers trully intended for this great country."
5,The Savage Court,"Dr. Savage's education and life experience are plainly evident as he lays out a compelling case against the dangers of rampant, monopolous liberalism. Blow off the people who condemn The Savage Nation and decide for yourself, liberal or conservative alike, if Savage is right."
1,Awful - truly awful book,"This guy is an intellectual car-accident. You can't help look at him, but after you've seen the guts and brain matter splattered all over the highway, you realize how sad and depressing it really is. After reading about three chapters, I became so depressed thinking how so many American's really believe this nonsense. How this type of person feeds on ignorance, fear, anger, and hatred like maggots feeding on a corpse. Its hard not to look at a car accident. The desire to see the unspeakable is powerful. But eventually, intelligent people realize why these things remain unspoken - they are wrong. Fundamentally wrong."
1,Why bother?,"I've listened to his show, outrageous, disjointed and vicious, and his book is only more of the same. Somehow, it is even less excusable when you see it in print. His diatribes against women, minorities, homeless, liberals, gays, etc. are nothing new: these are the standard victims of talk radio. But Savage takes his bitterness and hate to new levels, apparantly to elevate himself above the standard right-wing AM fare. The book is not funny, as his radio show unintentionally sometimes is, and it could have been written by anyone with a mean streak and a passing familiarity with his radio show. If you think Savage is a political and cultural genius, this book is for you. But do the rest of us a favor and get a vascectomy first."
3,"Okay, but not great","Savage is funny for about 50 pages and then it got old. He needs some new material. Still, if he's new to you this isn't a bad place to start."
1,Garbage,"It staggers the imagination that someone with so little talent and such great vituperation would gain a forum in the first place. Then again, as we view the intentions of those who own the media in which these views are voiced, it becomes more clear. In some ways I appreciate Savage, he is an embarrassment of riches in presenting the face of present day neo-conservatism. My schadenfreude is great with the evidence of his recent descent into oblivion. It may now be said of Savage...""and when he falls, he falls like Lucifer, never to hope again.""The book is garbage, but then, so is its author...bye bye Mike."
1,To paraphrase our president...,"Michael Savage will follow the steps of Coulter, Limbaugh and Hannity, and he will follow that trail all the way to where it ends: in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies.The modern rabid conservative movement seems to be losing steam as people wake up to the reality that liberals really don't hate America, that our melting-pot nation could never have existed without open minds and that hatred, bigotry and xenophobia are not really ""family values."" Savage Nation already feels like a throwback, and that gulf between Savage and the real world is only going to grow wider with time.Savage is cut from the same cloth as Coulter, he's just less interesting and probably not as bright."
1,worthless,"As a frequent conservative voter, male , married and even volunteered for the service, I thought I would find something of interest in this book. I didn't, nothing but hate and garbage. I tossed it after 45 pages."
1,"Savage is great on the radio, but he can't write","I love listening to Mike on the radio, but I have to tell you, he can't write. You are better off just tuning into to his show. He's funny on the air, but on paper it doesn't really work."
1,Pure Propaganda from a Sad Human,"Michael Savage is what is wrong with right wing radio today, he is and ""entertainer"" not a ""news and information source"". He claims that liberals hate the church, Isreales, freedom etc... And yet he shuts down and hangs up on anyone that disagrees with his hateful views. He is trying to present himself as the American ideal...where is the democracy in trying to shun other views. He is a psycho.... If you listen to him as a source of reason you are what's wrong with America today. Be objective don't let the right wing dirtbags change your views...they are persuasive ""entertainers"". I respect all views, but these are coming from an evil troll that crawls out of bed angry because momy didn't love him. His radio show is funny though...if you want to hear a psycho rave from the safety of your radio check it out."
1,"In a league of his own, Thank God","I consider myself a conservative. I voted for Reagan, Bush, Dole and Bush. I've read and enjoyed books by Ann Coulter, David Limbaugh, Rush Limbaugh, Harry Stein and others. I assumed I would also enjoy Mike SavageQuite frankly, I was shocked by what I read. I've never seen so much name-calling and hatred in a book by a so-called conservative. Mike Savage gives conservatives an underserved bad name. Please don't judge the rest of us by this buffoon."
2,"I'm conservative, too, but.....","Lots of rambling, but I could never figure out what his point was. Mostly everything he wrote is true, but in spite of his pointing out the acts and results of those acts committed by liberals, he never offers alternatives or solutions. All I got out of this narrative was that he is using his pen as a method of venting his frustrations. The title mentions saving America, but he never says how it can be done."
1,The kid who needs to be the center of attention,"Okay, I don't mind people who think differently than me, which is why I read this. But name-calling and temper tantrums are not my idea of a thoughtful presentation of ideas. This guy either is using white rednecks to line his pockets or he's the most terrified man I have ever encountered in print: scared of queers, scared of immigrants, scared of women. . .and he hates them all. A sad book."
4,Hard Hitting,"I wish that I couldn't believe what Mr. Savage has to say, but I do. He is well educated, no nonsense and to the point. He does not ""beat around the bush"". I like that! I highly recommend his book."
2,IT SOUNDS GOOD BUT NOOOOOOOOOO FACTS at all.,Educated people deserved educated FACTS.I whish he could prove and show who was the terroristthat pour poison on a girls food. (chapter on Immigration) and more...I believe Mr.Savage has an opinion a very strong opinion buthe was not able to show the facts and could not back them up either.I do not completly dismiss what he says (10%) but that does not make the book a good book.IT makes it a bellow average book.Probably Lazy-Uneducated-People with a Fast-Food-Mentalitywill believe what he says with out questioning the facts.Not me.
1,"As a Conservative, I feel sorry for Mr. Savage","I found several of the ideas in the book to be intruiging. However, it was next to impossible to unearth these nuggets from the heaping debris of rhetoric.I had a hard time believing that his book, filled with name-calling and childish rants, was written by someone with multiple advanced degrees. Perhaps if I listened to his radio show I would know who ""Rat Boy"" or ""Larry Seltzer"" were off the bat, but it took me a while to figure it out. Rather than letting his facts speak for themselves, he chooses to call people childish names. Rather than saying ""Johnnie Walker Lindh is a traitor,"" he basically says ""Rat Boy smells like poop."" Its sad.While he claims to be discussing ""facts,"" the book is devoid of any referencing or foot/endnotes. Which is a shame because some of his ""stories,"" if true, would be worth reading additional information on. Unfortunately, I have to, as Mr. Savage suggests, take his word for it."
1,Stunning.,"Can someone save this country from this ""book""? Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but wow- I'm impressed that someone so uninformed gets paid to ramble on about things he evidently knows nothing about."
1,Feel sorry for this tormented soul,"I am neither a democrat nor a republican because I believe when it comes to voting, I would look at the issues at hand and vote for the best candidates, not for a party. I am conservative on some issues, and liberal on others. However, I had the mosfortune of listening to him on a local FM talk radio. I feel sorry for this guy. He seems to be very upset with everything. He is always very hateful, very vengeful and bellicose - specially toward liberals. The way he mocks and attacks Muslims remind me of the conditions of Jews in Nazi Germany. I hope he does not represent true conservatives."
1,the new grand wizard of the klan and he's jewish too!,"repeat after me you right -wing idiots there is no liberal media, ann coulter has the brain of a peanut and start thinking for yourselves . now go watch fox news and fry the remaining lack of brain power hearing limbaugh."
2,"Review the book, not the man","Why can't readers comment on the content of a book and not the writer's ideology when it comes to conservative nonfictions such as this one? I don't like this book any more than I like the writer -- it's just the latest poorly written, poorly edited version of Angry White Man radio spinning off into publishing, which means it was outdated the day it appeared in stores. But it could just as easily be a book-length liberal rant as conservative -- ultimately, it's the book, people, the book that counts. And this book is bad. (Two stars because at the very least, it's not boring. As one other reviewer wrote, you turn the pages with the same motivation that causes you to slow down as you drive past a car wreck.)"
5,Awesome Book!!,We are still in the process of reading it but just the first few pages makes it a great read. We are Savage Nation fans!
3,Is This For Real or Just a Ploy?,I can't figure out if this is a ploy by Mr. Savage to gain sales with some of the out-there opinions he expresses in this book or if he actually is for real here. He sounds like the character Ollie Weeks in the 87th Precinct series by Ed McBain - he believes in equal opportunity prejudice.
1,most stuped book,he is making america as a hell for peace loving people.he just love war war and war because he is here in usa in a safe cage he dont have any mercy for the young soldiers who r risking their life for the sake of these type of fanatics .
1,Really Zero Stars,"More crying from yet another spoiled conservative brat who has it too damn good (see: Sean Hannity).""Mein Kampf"" was more subjective."
4,Suprisingly Rational Work,I've rarely heard Michael's radio show and when I have I've found him to be too angry. I was suprised that his book was NOT an endless attack on the left. I learned a lot about the author and have new respect for Michael Savage.
2,He needs to stick to radio,If you've never heard any Savage and you don't get him locally then this will do. If you've heard him on the radio a few times then this is nothing to write home about. He doesn't translate into the written word well. It makes him look kind of weird. It's much better to hear than to read.
5,everyone should read this book,"This book is excellently written and describes in depth the problems that we now face in America, especially in our political and government milieu.I loved the book. It is a tiny bit out of date, as many changes have occurred since it was written, but it is still what should be required reading for all who are interested in the ""real news.""As usual, Michael Savage is right on target. I appreciated the elusions to his background and his growing up time in the Bronx. He is a very bright man who is able to cut through the minusia[sic] of our everyday world and present options.I found the book thrilling, and I read it in only a few sittings, having difficulty putting it down. I think you would enjoy it also.If you enjoy listening to Dr. Savage on the radio, you will love to have this book to keep in your permanent library."
3,Hmmm...,"Interesting moments, especially since he's new to me. (Never heard the radio show.) But at times, I wasn't sure if I was laughing AT him or WITH him. He sure likes to point a finger of blame, and I can't say he's always wrong. For better and funnier social commentary, though, try ""No One's Even Bleeding"" or ""Delano""."
1,"The ""Andrew Dice Clay"" of political thought","This pains me to say this but... this is not a very good book. The major problem with Savage's arguments are that they're based on adrenaline and angst instead of facts that work. When he does make points that are true and accurate, they are usually so over-the-top and bombastic that it makes him seem uncredible. Not everyone that is conservative is this macho and what his book does is make the conservative movement look more angry than it actually is.If you are into books from talkshow hosts, get Hannity, get Limbaugh, get Marvin, skip Savage. He is the ""Andrew Dice Clay"" of political thought."
3,Good but its a bit extreme,"Michael Savage has done well, but he's a bit unrealistic as with some conservatives. The liberals are not only reason why our culture is in the bad shape its in. Ultimately is is a theological problem. Our country was founded on biblical framework (note: not a christian nation) and on the heels of a revival of Calvinism (through the ministry of George Whitefield and others). Over the following decades our nation became more secularized through the influence of the transendentalists and darwinists. When a nation becomes religously corrupt, then it becomes socially and politically. That being said, Michael Savage does well but doesn't go to root of the problem, the religious apostasy of this nation."
2,babbling man full of contradictions,"The guy is an immigrant son, yet he is against immigration.The guy is against liberals, yet he attended the most liberal school in the nation (Berkeley).The guy brags about his education and uses that to legitimize his views on politics, yet his degrees are all medical related.The guy has not complimented one immigrant or colored person in the book, and has defended white people when they do something wrong.Michael Savage: America will never be what it was like in the '50s. You cannot stay the same in a changing world."
1,This is not a book,There are no bibliography to back up his quotes and stats. Didnt this guy learn anything in his college class...cite your sources. It's just a bunch of rants bounded in a book.
1,A Great Book for Racists and Fascists,"Take every myth and [tradition] you've ever heard about different ethnic groups and immigrants to the USA. Then, blame every problem facing the nation on those people and use the [traditions] to make illogical connections. That's what you get in this hate-filled book. Save your money!"
1,egomaniac!,"Savage is one of the worst hosts in radio history. He thinks he is always right, thereby closing his mind to new ideas. His book reads like a sleeping pill, ideas flow like a log jam in a river. Savage is not a great thinker, he is not a great communicater, and his views on his fellow human beings is less than respectable. Savage lacks the wit of Moore, the insight of Limbaugh, and the humanity of a toad in the swamp. Avoid this book, it will only make you regret you are of the same species as the author."
1,Fools on the Right to match the Fools on the Left,"What America needs right now is intelligent, non-partisan, engaged discussion of the challenges and options it faces. Unfortunately this book (and others like it, by authors on both the right and left) just crank up the volume of the yelling match. That's not a surprise: talk radio isn't a source most people look to for reasoned discourse. But folks like Savage, who earn their living by provocation, should really think a little harder about what they're doing.If you hate immigrants, gays, liberals, smart women, foreigners, or people who disagree with you, you'll probably like this book. Otherwise...spare yourself and your blood pressure."
1,"""Dr"" Savage is ignorant and illogical.","The three times I've heard ""Dr"" Savage gloat about his PhD, he mentioned three different fields. On his radio show, he once said PhD in ""Herbal Medicene"" and ""Herbal Science"". On MSNBC on Jan 10th, he said it was ""Medical Science"". Pray tell us, ""Dr"" Savage, which one is it?Even if he does have a legitimate PhD in any one of the above three frields, how does that make him an authority on Politics?No it does not and it shows profusely in this long, incoherrent rant. Too bad I could not give him 0 stars."
5,The Bible is Written to Men,"Lady did you make that baby-How did you put the head on straightwhy didn't you give it hands of eight-It is divined to keep its date-God made woman to procreateNot to compete with her mateMary nurtured it while it grewYou error if you choose to exchewGod built it, and He didn't use glueHe made it, it's not part of youHe used the vessel He designed for it too."
1,Attn conservatives : please stop whining,"Is this guy's 15 minutes up yet? Just read the book and I have come to the conclsuion that the talk radio conservatives have become the nation's biggest whiners. Thier mantra: blame the media, blame the gov't, blame the education system - basically blame everyone but themselves when things don't go just thier way.Guess what? The act is tired and has worn really , really thin. Thankfully- as evidenced by books like this -the idea of the talk radio flavor of the month whiner has offically worn out its welcome on the rest of us. You remember us; we're the real americans everywhere that are too busy working to call some silly talk show and stroke the egos of guys like this. My review is not a blanket slam on conservatives - there are plenty of good writers out there of every political bent- sadly, this book is not by one of them."
1,"Oh boy, more propaganda!","Fascism (n.) - a system of government characterized by rigid one-party dictatorship, forcible suppression of the opposition, belligerent nationalism and racism, and glorification of war."
1,disgusting,"then you people wonder why you get planes flown into your buildingsyou are the most ignorant, arrogant, racist people on earth"
5,The Truth Exposed,"Having been raised is a socialist country and having been fed liberal lies similar to the ones fed to America, I was first shocked, but then later absolutely delighted to find Michael Savage and his book. If you truly have an open mind and are not too far gone to be rescued, the Savage Nation will open your eyes and make you want to shout out loud : Yes !! Finally someone who is not afraid to tell the truth."
1,Just another pig-headed Conservative,"Even the title makes me sick. This is slander -- thats it. If you want propaganda, then read this. If you're conservative, read away."
5,A book for the compassionate conservative..,"Just finished reading the copy I received for christmas and I enjoyed it immensely. It's raw, humorous, and oh so true. If you enjoy Michael's show, it's a must have. Michael brings to the table something much of the media has been unable to do, and that is provide the truth about our nation and the world around us. To the guy above, I'd suggest listening to the show instead of thumbing through channels."
5,"Life isn&#65533;t about feelings, its about reactionary truth","Only a communist\socialist would rate this book 1 or 2 stars. If you have any interest in what the leftist bastards have to say about this beloveds county of ours, you have to read Mike latest explosion of words. I recommend this book to every Red Blooded American and with respect to the left or other, give it a read. You may finally feel something that could change your life forever. Life isn't about feelings, its about reactionary truth.Keep it up MikeScott Schaaf"
5,Honest and convincing,"I disagree with Mr. Savage that top universities only breed ultra liberals who are destroying our culture and families. Although I am a graduate of one of the institutions Mr. Savage criticizes, I agree with Mr. Savage's thoughts in most respects. I think his analysis is excellent and conclusions correct and very honest. I believe that most of us are getting sick and tired of the brainwashing and coercion by the ultra liberal media, but too many of us are afraid to admit it. I do think that Mr. Savage is too harsh with respect to hard working immigrants. These people often have better values (including family values) and more common sense than many of the ""politically correct"" Americans."
3,I Agree..I'm Just Bored,"Loved everything Mr. Savage said, but I found it a boring read. He is better listened to, rather than read..."
1,'Wiener' Nation - That's his real last name,"This book is for fools who are easily swayed by incendiary remarks and arguments. The popularity of this man is truly frightening. His rhetoric is absurdly entertaining. Yet, it is scary that many Americans truly believe 'the true & free of spin' political commentary, from a vitamin salesman [Wiener]and two college dropouts [Limbaugh and Hannity]. Fascism reigns in the Weiner Nation."
5,The truth hurts.,"I understand why people are upset with this book. It's hard to realize that things that you thought or believed your whole life are actually crazy and completely messed up. It's upsetting, but it's okay. Welcome to the truth!This book is excellent. I like the way that Mr. Savage writes at a level that everyone can understand. He is a very smart man and knows how to put together intelligent thoughts. Yes, maybe he is a little angry in the book, but he has to be agressive so that he can cut through the thick lies of the liberals!Give the book a chance, even if you are a hardcore tree-hugging, hollywood loving, feminist liberal. Read it. Try it. Please. For the sake of our nation's future!"
1,This book was awful!,"This book was really hard to get through. I kept thinking it would get better, but it never did. While I may agree with a few of his ideas, most of them are frightening. What if everyone thought like this? It was difficult to actually get angry reading it because most of it was just nonsense.Save your money on this one. There are so many good books to read. This one is a waste of time."
5,The Truth Always Comes Out,"Dr. Savages book ""The Savage Nation"" tells it like it is and doesn't pull any punches. As a young American who cares about his country and will do anything to preserve our borders, language and culture, I salute Michael Savage for telling it like it is.Semper Fidelis"
1,Hate book of the Century,"This book is a perfect example of how cold-hearted and crass the conservatives can be. Just reading the first ten pages of Mr. Savage exhibiting absurdities about how disturb the liberals or anyone who's not a 100% hard core conservative is just plain comical and not to mention insanity. Worst of all, just reading between the lines of this hate-filled book seems to advocate animosity and aggressiveness toward anyone whos is none-white or is intelligent enough to refute his garbage. Any normal rational being would use this book for toilet paper. Anyone who has a affilation with the klan or some hate group would cherish this book."
3,"I love Michael, but this book isn't his best stuff","If you love ""The O'Reilly Factor"" program but were a bit disappointed in O'Reilly's books, you'd feel the same way about Savage's work.The Savage Nation radio program is sheer genius, and the book is basically Michael's takes on many significant issues. I dont know why, but it just doesn't read as well as it plays on the air. His name calling of Hillary (""Pillory"") Clinton and others seems clever on the air, but in print it looks rather childish... sometimes even idiotic.Bottom line, it's a good book if you agree with Savage and want to hear him on some issues that he doesn't normally talk about on air. I also have no problem supporting him financially when threats of boycotts are coming at him from all sides. He's a good man, a dying breed, and he should have spent an extra year polishing this book up some, because he is better than this."
1,Dregs and Vestiges,"Speaking as a political, moral and social conservative, I must say that this book is a major disappointment and proves that someone with a little ""celebrity"" can get something published.I agree with some (not all) of his opinions. However, the problem is the arguments he makes in expressing his opinion. Aside from being superficial, poorly written and unduly confrontational, this book is a classic. A classic of what....who knows. Mr. Savage, a miserable human being who feels compelled to make a complete fool of himself, is worth neither the time nor the effort.......unless one is a liberal and wants a good laugh. Mr. Savage singlehandedly demolishes a piece of civilization every day....he must be so proud. The old phrase - garbage in, garbage out - clearly applies here.Give me William F. Buckley any day. The frightening thing is, there are a lot of people out there who think this guy is brilliant."
1,A BUNCH OF MESS,"MICHAEL SAVAGE IS A JOKE.. HIS BOOK IS AT MERE BEST A ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE LISTNERS AND READERS BY PLAYING TO PREJUDICES OF AMERICA. FOR THIS MAN TO CALL HIMSELF A TRUE AMERCIAN, YET REFUSES TO ACCEPT ANYONE WHO DOES NOT AGREE WITH HIS CONCEPT OF LIFE. MOST FRIGHTENING IS THAT HIS VIEWS ARE DIVISIVE AT BEST AND CREATE FEAR AND HATRED AMONG AMERICANS. IN POST 911 WE NEED MORE UNITY AND LESS FRICTION AS CAUSED BY THIS BOOK AND HIS SHOW. IT IS A SAD DAY IN AMERICA WHEN THE VIEWS OF A SHOCK JOCK ARE EMBRACED BY MIDSTEAM AMERICA."
1,Makes Limbaugh seem reasonable.....,"This guy is completely out of control and should be fitted for a strait jacket immediately. If you are an unstable right wing whacko looking to have your views validated before heading out to a Klan meeting, buy this book. Otherwise, stay away."
1,The man is full of hate.,The book is horrible. It's classic factless hatred. If you want the truth and entertainment read Geneva Nights.
1,Unconvincing and poorly researched,"Savage's book is a poorly-written and ill-researched rant constructed to appeal tothe uneducated, disenfranchised, wife-beating lowest-common denominator.I had hoped to gain insight about contemporary Americanconservatism, but this book did not deliver. Ultimately, reading this book wasn't at all worthwhile.If you are compelled to read it, try to find a copy at the library...I really wishI had passed on this book and bought a steak dinner instead."
1,The Sears Catalog of Political Books,"... This isn't really a work of literature; it's a diatribe of narrow-minded hatred ... There is nothing presented in this book that you can't learn by listening to a mere five minutes of Savage's syndicated radio talk show. Savage's ""work"" covers typical right-wing fodder such as immigration, foreign policy, the ACLU, and liberals of all shapes and sizes. ... .Just how does Savage recommend we protect America's ""borders, language and culture""? Well, how about launching nuclear strikes against Afghanistan and Iraq, locking all ""liberals"" up in mental institutions and jailing all ACLU lawyers. ...As a piece of literature, this book has no value whatsoever. But if you do purchase it, ..., enjoy it, page-by-page, in the same manner that your grandparents enjoyed the Sears catalog - ...P>So as a thought-provoking work of literature I give it Two-Thumbs-Down. But as a companion piece for your beloved copy of Mein Kampf I give a Two-Thumbs-Up."
2,YAWN YAWN YAWN,WHEN ARE TALK SHOW HOST GOING TO LEARN THAT WE THE PUBLIC HAVE BRAINS OF OUR OWN AND THAT THEY DO NO SPEAK FOR US...MICHAEL SAVAGE IS A COMIC.. HE HAS LEARNED THE TRADE TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH ON HIS TALK SHOW BUT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE A BOOK....OK M. SAVAGE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR 15 MINS OF FAME BUT PLESE STICK TO YOUR RADIO SHOW AND LEAVE THE WRITING TO INTELLEGENT PEOPLE...
1,A waste of time,"As a former scientist, Mr. Savage should know better than to espouse false dichotomies, make glaring accusations without even a cursory mention of facts or statistics, and stereotype by name calling. I realize that, like M. Moore, a lot of what he writes and says could pass for humor, and perhaps on this level, the book is worth one star. However, as a book that informs, Michael Savage comes across as just another blowhard."
1,Ridiculous Rants from a Psueto Intellectual Hate Monger,"After hearing Savage on the radio, I was not surprized by the nonsense contained in this, his latest epistle. Savage is basically a psueto-intellectual, self-promoting hate monger who brings nothing but vitriol and disinformation to the table. His accusations and theories are so preposterous as to be beneath comment. Savage is a non-player and this book is about as credible as the latest ravings of the UFO abduction crowd. It may have been good for a laugh if not for the fact that a sizable portion of people mistake this drek for cogent thought. The fact that this creatin has garnered a national audience is disturbing and speaks to the readiness on the part of various media outlets to chase ratings without regard to any professional ethic."
1,Unrelenting diatribe,"Much like Michael Weiner Savage's 'The Savage Nation' - both the book and the radio show - 'The Enemy Within' is another seemingly neverending, paranoid rant about why liberals are ruining the United States of America. Much of what is contained within the book's 272 pages would be redundant to anyone that listens to Savage's three hour radio show on any given day. More often than not, Savage talks a lot while saying very little.Overall, the book is poorly written, and many of the points Savage tries to convey to his audience are ruined by his alarmingly vitriolic, bigoted, biased viewpoints.This is just another worthless opinion from a ""red-diaper doper-baby."""
2,Not the normal reasoned republican book.,"Savage is insulting. I am Cuban American, a yellowdog Republican, and yet he still gets under my skin. His books are filled with nativeist, authoritarian, and conspiratorial sentiments. In one chapter he advocates the clubbing of suspects by law enforcement! This is what I expect in Castro's Cuba, not in my parents adopted homeland.If you are looking for an amusing book for a lazy afternoon buy it, but this definitely shouldn't be considered by anyone who takes politics or current events seriously. His writing is wholly dependent on provoking paranoia to such a degree that his fear mongering can be compared to Marxist and NeoLiberal diatribes."
4,Savage Rules,"Great book slamming the illiberal left wing propaganda machine. Exposes the hypocracy and illuminates the modus operandi of the Democrats, ACLU and other radical left-wing front groups. Trashes the ""Republicrats"" and ""Democans"" for failing to secure our borders resulting in a flood of undocumented aliens, some who want to kill us, and others who just want free education, welfare, food stamps, SSI and medicare. Very easy reading book with interesting stories and antidotes. Hard book to put down. That other negative review is completely wrong!"
2,SICK MAN JUST WANT TO MAKE MONEY AND FAME ....THATS ALL,he is just a new juggler first who have checked the narrow thinking of left wing and now he is playing with them and making money and fame .he is a bad and coward dectator who just want to talk talk and talk who dont want to listen any body's views if somebody is aggreing with him he can talk with him more then one minit in his show but is somebody is disagree with him then he will abuse him and dont let him talk more then 20 sec because he is too affraid of truithYou can listen his show and can realise very easily that he is dictator and dont want to listen the views of his apponents.how can somebody justify his views with listining his apponents.think about it.
3,Word swap,"If you leave the text of this book 'as-is' and change out the following words, you get an interesting commentary on the American political landscape.OUT/INDemocrat for AmericanLiberal for ChristianFeminist for ImperialistHomosexual for InfidelGOP for The ChurchRepublican for The FaithfulWow. Sounds like somthing that Osama would say. Savage uses the same words, the same ideas and the same inflammatory language that fundamentalist conservatives use ALL OVER THE WORLD.Perhaps it is time that we look at ourselves as individuals and make a judgment rather than pointing at others and screaming. At this point in American society, the guy with the loudest mouth wins. Perhaps we should talk to the quiet guys and see what they have to say."
1,Shawn Carkonen jealous bias liberal,"The problem with book reviewers like this Shawn Carkonen(biased) is exactly what Michael Savage is talking about in this book. He is Jealous of Michael Success with the Common American people. Savage is angry, but compasionate and should be. He speaks the truth about what is actually happening to our country's ""borders language and culture"" due to the ""bleeding Heart"" liberals. There is plenty of useful information in this book. The man is popular because he dares to say what the liberals are trying to hide> ""Truth"" about whats destroying our country due strictly to the Liberals effort to gain political advantage. This book is well worth every hard earned cent!"
1,Save yourself. Don't try to read this book,"This man self described as a ""truth-in mouth"" syndrome victim must be a victim of the ""never-used brain"" syndrome.Be aware, this is a very contagious disease. You can get infected through the radio !"
1,Q: Who is Michael Savage?,"A: The love child of Pat Buchanan and Anne Coulter. Readers who enjoyed this book also enjoyed Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and The Misunderstood Genius of Bull Connor. Highly recommended for conservatives not too busy cutting those little eye-holes out of their sheets."
1,Worth a 5 minute read.,"It's thin, with few pages, therefore easy for most of his ""Savage Nation"" to read I suppose. I was hoping for a real book here as most ultra right wigers I hear rant have been clamoring for months about this book. I guess ol Mike has been pushing this hard, along with News Max and other corporate media types.It's pretty much the same garbage he spews on the air. Pure entertainment and he doesn't back up a single ""fact"". Buy it used, cheap."
1,"Don't Read the Book, Listen to Savage Read it to You.","Don't waste your money buying this book. Just listen to his show and he reads it every night. I believe he reads it over and over, cover to cover.The book is about hate and his personal promotion."
1,Waste of time,"I didn't like this book. I couldn't tell when he was kidding and when he was serious. I'm sure the part about Blacks paying reparations to Jews was a joke, but it wasn't a very funny one.Saying that Liberals are more dangerous than Al Qaeda was serious, I believe. So was the part about Liberals being mentally ill. Who could possibly believe this stuff?This book was a complete waste of time. I didn't spend any money on it, thank goodness, just read it in the bookstore.I like the reviews of the book which claim that just because this guy has a Ph.D. in something, he must know what he's talking about. Please, give me a break."
1,The Savage EGO,"Gosh, it must be hard for MIKEY to be humble.. he is always right (at least that is what he seems to claim on a regular basis).I do not think there are any listeners to his radio show that like hearing his voice more than Savage himself.It is too bad that he has already turned into just another money seeking radio shock jock. He can`t even keep track of the points he tries to make anymore. Babble, babble.. babble.Mikey - don`t you realize the simple truth? YOU have become just like everyone else you claim to despise! Of course, with the money you now are making.. I am sure you do not care!"
5,Savage says what needs to be heard,"Savage's writing is a little scattered like his radio show, but has alot to say. Do not let the comical and outrageous style of Michael Savage decieve you. He points out problems with illegal immigration and other issues. Although this book is slanted to the right, it is a must read regardless of your political point of view. You might change your thinking on some issues.Enjoy!!!"
3,Some truth and crutch.,Savage speaks to subjects like immigration that are considered taboo by the PC Left. Unfortunately he uses homopobia as a crutch for many of his arguments and so his credibility is eroded. That's too bad.
1,Savage nation indeed,Conservatives don't even PRETEND to be compassionate.What you have here is Micahel Savage pandering to the lowest common denominator. Pandering to a group of people who think they own this country. A group of people who are completely oblivious to facts and revel in their utter and complete ignorance. Good thing i didnt purchase this sorry excuse for a book. It makes a great coaster.
4,WIENER NATION?,"Michael savage might have been a wiener at one time, but he's changed his name, because a wiener nation ........ well savage just sounds better. Regarless of your opinion, read his book. liberals will be forced to re-evaluate their thinking. conservatives will be forced to re-evaluate their thinking...let's all just try to think.........."
4,The truth is hard to take....,"While some may have issues with Michael's style he does a great job of shining the light on the socialists in our country. One must understand that Michael views himself as an entertainer and social commentator. While he presents his views like a comedian from the Bronx he's got the experience and background to back up his views and has a well defined sense of right and wrong.While Michael's style sometimes makes me whince, I share his views and his concern for the direction our country is headed."
3,He's not afraid to speak his mind,"This book is generally an entertaining, quick read. Savage is an emotional, passionate person. His style is blustery, cutting, humorous and to the point. If you have ever heard his radio show, the book reads the way he talks. For many, ""The Savage Nation"" will be a wake-up call about how liberal, non-traditonal values are undermining the strength of this country. To liberals, he will sound like an hysterical right winger, trapped in the fifties, railing against social evolution and progress. But I think he presents his case rather well and I'm with him. Go Savage Go!"
5,Breath of fresh political incorrectness,"A book that reads well and speaks truth. If you're tired of your rights being suppressed by the likes of the ACLU and other radical liberals, you will enjoy reading this book. Michael Savage is someone who is not afraid to use his First Amendment Rights, definitely telling it like it is."
2,"Savage, unamerican","The book highlights the hypocrisy of today's right wing talk show host: the author romanticizes war without having fought, pushes tax cuts that assist no one but himself and his elite friends, advocates cuts in education knowing his family will never need public education and launches unamerican personal attacks on political opponents in the name of ""patriotism.""He attacks immigration into the United States, the very thing that made our country great. In the 1700's, our English ancestors immigrated here to avoid the very same persucution that Savage advocates on todays immigrants. In the 1800's Irish and Italian immigrants helped create the modern economic powerhouse."
5,Savage has hit it on the mark,As a conservative from the San Francisco Bay Area I have known the oppression that Liberalism brings. Liberals don't want you to say what you think. They want you to think what they say. Savage has it absolutely right.
1,On Sanity,"Whatever one may think of Michael Savage, through his fans, as we find them herein, we see evidence of the relationship between evaluating and sanity."
1,Another incoherent tirade,"As a liberal, I like to read what the other side thinks about issues of the day. In this incoherent tirade, Savage writes purely for the benefit of those who will blindly nod their heads at the evils of liberals, commies, and especially... the Clintons. It's truly amazing the venom that conservatives still hold for the man. This book is no different from any other Hannity or Colter conservative tirade, in that it provides no proof for any of its various rants and exists solely to make the author money because he knows that ditto heads who need to feed and justify their hatred will lap it up. Conservatism is a legitimate political viewpoint, that I don't happen to agree with, but understand its legitimacy. Why though do conservatives have a need to ""prove"" how horrible all liberals are? We aren't. We just disagree with you."
3,Michael Wiener?,"Is that his real name? I don't blame him for changing it. ""the wiener nation"" just doesn't have a good ring to it. ha ha...pretty good book though."
1,Too far to the right!,"Michael Savage is so far to the right he make Hitler look like a liberal. In my opinion Mr. Savage is a left wing plant, and his role is to make conservatives look like nutballs!If you do read ""The Savage Nation"", take it with the proverbial grain of salt."
1,ugg,"Leave aside the inanity. Leave aside the knee-jerk, run with the herd conservatism. Leave aside that this author is clearly just another neandrathal yearning for the days when there were no problems in the world (i.e. in the world where straight, white, middle and upper-class men ruled and agilely repressed anyone and everyone else. It's kind of like wishing you were the Pharoah, or fought in the Crusades. It can be a fun fantasy, but y'know, we all have to live in the century we were born to.)All of that left aside, the book is just a rant and a waste of money. Nothing you couldn't get for free on a radio program. While I usually disagree with the conclusions drawn by political conservatives, I respect the fact that their arguements can, in many cases, be cogent and fact-based. If you really want to read conservative dogma, there are a host of better writers. Don't throw away your time and money on this one."
1,Junk Philosophy and Paranoia,"I read parts of it at Powell's. It's the usual rhetoric that's on the show, plus some added/extended verbiage. Worthless, nothing new, and most of all: boring. Heard it all on the radio show. At least he doesn't go into his digestive and gastronomic complaint ramblings like on the radio. Worthless at any price..."
1,"Snake Oil, Monkey Hips & Rice","Savage is one angry dude. He has turned this anger into one long tirade against everything he disagrees with in this country. A nation under Savage would be a nation divided, perhaps, separtate but equal.For all his supposed education, Savage cannot back up his claims with facts, nor can he defend a point too long without decending into the muck and mire of name calling. This book is perhaps a good coffee table book, or at least a coaster, but go elsewhere if you are looking for ideas."
1,utter hypocrisy,"Were the Weiners (Dr Savage's family) not immigrants? Did they not contribute to their adopted country? Are there not multiple visions of America? At a time when America is the preeminent power of the world, unequaled in the history of the world, do not alarms of American decline ring hollow? When the Republican party controls the presidency, the supreme court and the congress, can liberals be reasonably viewed as dominating political life?Dr Savage's intemperate screed falls on the sword of reality, time and time again. Constructive debate about the republic's future must stand on a more solid foundation. Preaching to the converted is no more useful, or counterproductive, to the right than to the left."
1,"Lies, lies and inaccuracies... Avoid this like the plague!","Regarding Savage's inaccuracies, his book actually has a chapter entitled, ""If the NAACP Had Existed During World War II."" The NAACP was founded in 1909!!Hate acts like blinders for some people. It makes it easier to close the mind. His is full of hate and his mind is slammed shut and welded tight! Narcissism comes close to a diagnosis... Throw in a healthy dose of megalomania and you come even closer still. Why, I ask, are people trying to take apart America with such glee and abandon?This seamless hatred is hatred of all that made America great. Believe a liar at your own peril."
1,Another book on how minorities are destroying america,"A professed homophone, Savage's book is little more than the dribble he spouts on his AM talk show. Except that he doesn't even provide the humor and entertainment of a Limbaugh. Just a rant about how immigrants (especially nonwhite imigrants) are a threat to America blah blah blah. I guess there are nativists in every generation, but Savage (real name Michael Weiner)takes it to a sad new extreme."
1,First Star General,This book is one of the the best books ever period after the Bible. Mr Savage is very very smart. He proves how gays and foreigners and liberal media are bad. I really feel that Mr. Savage should be made our First Star General of our great military. He could find and kill many of the terrorists and snipers plus Osama and Iraq and Saddam.
1,Something I never thought of....,There's really no need to align yourself with a set of morals or ideals. It's much easier to simply hate everyone.
1,At Least Archie Bunker had a Heart!,"I purchased this book from Half Priced Books and all I have to say is Thank God! I didn't pay full price. This is the lowest of the lowest common denominator, this is precisely why our nation is in a downward spiral and it has nothing to do with Liberalism, it has everything to with the right to freedom of speech that these acid tongued right wing pundits exploit for financial gain. Mr. Weiner(real name, how appropriate) is an obnoxious fame hungry, heartless, shallow, angry inflamed sphincter who has nothing intellectually stimulating and or beneficial to contribute to the mental health and stability of this country, don't be fooled these people are the real traitors. What I find especially disturbing is people out there actually think this bile belching Quack speaks the Gospel. This book is for the new conservatives who have to remind themselves that they are mental Pygmies. People of a higher intellect are forwarned either read it for a laugh or steer clear."
1,This guy has issues,"Being that this guy likes to ridicule in the most immature manner that I haven't seen in most children, I'd say much of the the basis of this book is probably something on the order of this guy had a very liberal girlfriend who dumped him and he still can't get over it.There are things Savage says that I agree with that no one else has the courage to say. However given the immature rhetoric and childish finger pointing, if you're conservative, you ought to be ashame there's other conservatives like this guy.His real name is Micheal Wiener. Now wouldn't that be a better name? The ""Weiner Nation""."
1,I would give it no stars,"This book is worthless if you are a conservative and especially worthless if you were looking for worthy opponent. I am a conservative, but even I was outraged with author's ideas. This is poorly written, hateful, and confrontational book, that has no factual data, no scientific analysis, no proves, and no common sense. Michael Savage is racist, religious fanatic, demagogue, and self-assured jerk."
2,"Yeah, this is really just ranting...","This isn't serious political analysis, it's just ranting, name-calling drivel. It's sort of entertaining, and I agree with him on maybe thirty to forty percent of the issues, but he's not a scholarly figure or even clever. As I saw on an anti-Savage website once: ""Calling the New York Times the Old York Times? LOL."" Alright...I've read this book a few times, they're mostly just columns he wrote for World Net Daily. He'll never convince you to join his side.His book summed up for you:1) Gay people suck2) Al Gore is a Communist3) Family values as he defines them and Fundamentalist Christianity are goodTo quote Savage in his book, ""That's it. It's over. You're done.""Typical stuff. For good analysis, read Ann Coulter, Phyllis Schlafly, Thomas Sowell, and Michelle Malkin. I agree with about half of what most of them say, but they're impassioned and reasonable."
3,Interesting read,"One must give credit to Michael Savage for highlighting the excesses of liberal politics, particularly in red California.This book is interesting, but like Michael Savage's mind, it can be a little extreme or confusing. Savage has done a lot for the conservative movement, and is at his best behind a microphone."
3,Close but no cigar!,"As a member of the Savage Nation in the San Francisco Bay Area, I was a might disappointed that Michael did not cover much NEW ground here. If you listen to the radio program, forget the book...been there, done that. If you do not get the radio program, buy the book. Pure Savage!"
1,An embarrassment to the human race,"If you have listened to his radio show (even briefly), you know what you are in for. After all, this book is by a person who asserts that women should not be permitted to vote- they're ""too emotional"". This screed is simply more hate, more bias, and more bigotry from the same folks who bring us Liddy, Hannity, O'Reilly, Coulter, Rushbo, Fox ""news"", and the rest of the right wing raving crowd. Sadly, they cannot help but try to out do each other. Apparently there are enough loonies like the fans who write 5 star reviews for this garbage to make publishing these poor excuses for books profitable. It makes one worry about our future as a nation."
1,Another manifesto,"Savage is the latest opportunist to turn the right wing mantra into money for himself: by writing a book that says every problem in America is the fault of liberals, foreigners, women, intellectuals, homosexuals, poor people, and people of color. Savage (how ironic--a name that suits the person perfectly) tells us that hate is indeed a family value, while appealing to the most base (and baseless) fears of conservatives. He gives simple answers to difficult questions, ala Rush, Ann Coulter, and Sean Hannity. So, if you're looking for someone to blame because your life isn't what you want it to be, this would be a good book with which to start your collection. It'll give you so many different people to hate you won't know where to begin. Happy reading!"
1,Its obvious. . . .,"that most of the reviewers that have given this book 5 stars haven't even read this book. I am not a democrat or republican, but I know stupidity when I see it. This guy is the ""Howard Stern"" of political talk radio. The only reason he gets 1 star is because I can't give him zero. In addition, he is mildly funny if you realize that most of his rambling is truly there to get people angry and nothing more. His ideas are so poorly backed by the lack of facts or figures that I'm sure he makes half of this stuff up just to get a rise out of liberals."
1,Ignorant emotional rants,A most boring intellectually challenged read. Full of nonsense and foolish nazi reasoning.
5,EXPOSES THE LEFT AND THEIR INTENTIONS.,"You will see many other reviewers calling him an Nazi and a Jew which exposes the virulent hatred and racism of the ""compassionate liberal"" mind. Only the truth exposes such hatred. This book exposes the tactics of such hate groups such as the ACLU and the Democratic Party and their belief that Osama bin Laden is more preferable than President Bush. Michael Savage has a unique talent for bringing to light the true intentions of the do gooders on the left such as their belief that animals have more value than children. Michael does this in an entertaining style. Some on the left just have misguided intentions and others like Hitlery Clinton and Barbara ""The Baby Butcher"" Boxer actully know the damage they are causing to this country and do it anyway. This book shows you how they are doing it."
1,Easily the Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"I wanted to see what the hype was about, so I took the book out of the library and read it. God help us that some people read this book and believe this moron."
4,The liberals attack on Amazon.com reviews!,"It's intersting to see that most of the reviews listed here are by admitted liberals attacking this book. I don't see the conservatives attacking Stupid White Man Michael Moore.If you are a conservative and feel things have gotten out of hand here with frivolous lawsuits, sloppy immigration laws and other outrageousness, then this book is for you. If not, then sleep away and just keep reading the New York Times.This is a good read with provocative ideas that can be finished in a day or two."
4,Inspirational,I think that John V. Hardin is a blessed and gifted man of God. I also think that the entire CD is uplifting and God was with John as he was singing and making this CD. I pray that he will continue to do Gods Will and that God will continue to bless him.
3,Not bad for the money,For the money it is not bad but many competitors offer HDTV which this isn't but the picture is good. I was disappointed when hooking it to my laptop. I got these flashing lines and changing settings and resolution didn't help. When I played a movie from a DIVX file on my laptop it disappeared and look pretty darn good.
2,Absolutely Great !!!,"I was extremely pleased with the speedy delivery, which was less than a week !!! The new flat panel LCD tv has a great picture and is a real pleasure to watch. I would definitely purchase more products from Tiger Direct as I enjoy their discounted prices and efficient service. Thank You !!!"
2,Very Poor technical Support,"My Tv started to have sound problems and I sent off an email to Olevia. No response. Then tried calling support - had to leave a message.Days later after no response I called and transferred to sales - helpful guy and wanted all the details but again he could not help and would have tech support call me back - NO LUCK with call back3 weeks go by and now I am getting rather ticked at the no response. So rewrote email again - no response.Called tech support and left my number - no response.Again called sales and got another person.Got a live body - Yaaahoo! - could not help but forwarded me to customer service (to give me the service at home number). Customer service could not help and said Tech support were the ones to talk to. After an hour plus on hold I get to talk to a tech. 1/2 hour later he came to the conclusion that I needed service.The support issue is really bad. My recomendation is call them yourself before you buy the TV.Oh, and Good Luck!!!!"
4,Excellent LCD TV,"I have owned this TV for about 6 months. Excellent dorm room TV.PRO: very good quality picture & viewing angle, many inputs, good sound quality, price is better than big name 15"" LCD TVs.CON: cheap remote, not HDTV ready"
2,Kind of old,"the movie story, picture even the audio are kind of old.for collectors it is kind if nice to copmlete all deniros movies by having this movie"
2,"Pretty, but not expected","A good modern coctail-lounge-style rendition of music associated with the Civil War. Unfortunately, I was expecting music contemporary to the period."
5,Untouchable by Sarah Champion,"A disturbingly realistic view of our future world, two hundred years from now, but refreshingly different from the norm of sci-fi novels penned by predominately male authors. Sarah Champion has injected a kickass girl image into her highly descriptive first novel. It's great edge-of-seat reading and the sequel is eagerly awaited."
4,This is a perfect deck for guidance and self realization,These cards can be used like the tarot and can be used in meditation. These cards are designed to help you get in touch with your higher self and other higher beings.
1,You cannot buy this album cheap enough to bother with it,"This is easily the worst recording I have ever attempted to listen to. The performers are fine. The orchestra is only passible. The technical recording itself is atrocious! The microphones must have been placed over the front rows of the audience who were asthmatic or recovering from bronchitis. If you dare to listen to this wreck of a recording you will hear more hacking, coughing, nose blowing and sneezing than you should have heard in your life time. On top of that, the first rows must have been peopled by those who are enchanted by their own voices. I couldn't believe that an audience could be so crude.DO NOT waste your money on this recording. It is so bad I haven't been able to tolerate it long enough to put the second disc in the player--even though I'm a huge Sutherland fan. If I ever thoroughly hate somebody, I'll give them this recording for a gift."
1,Shouldn't even be on the market,"First of all, this product is dark brown and there was no way I would brush with a dark brownish red powder. When I ordered it, I thought the brand name was ""Red"", not the supposed color. Secondly, every word on the container was in a foreign language that I could not read. Thirdly, it was ordered from India. If I had known that, I never would have ordered it. Amazon should tell people when a foreign product is being ordered. I threw it out. Be prepared, this is not what one expects in a tooth powder. I googled all the ingredients (foreign language) and every English translation was an herb, spice or plant. However, even though it supposedly had all natural products, I just could not brush my white teeth with this brown stuff. A total waste of money and I threw it in the garbage. Couldn't think of a good use for it unfortunately."
5,Awesome DVD,"I highly recommend this DVD for beginners. I've tried a variety of other approaches, including lessons and Youtube, to learning different dances and highly recommend this. Video is easy to follow. Good production quality. And makes it fun to learn. Am ordering a bunch of additional DVDs on Swing and other dances.Shawn and his wife do a great job with clear instruction. They show 1 step and 3 step options to make it easy for you to dance to any pace. This is way cheaper than lessons. It is also great documentation - if you are like me and may need a quick refresher down the road."
4,"Good looking, writes smooth, but needs improvement","I like this pen. It is elegant and a pleasure to write with. However, it leaks like crazy, even with the most gentle of jerks or shakes. You have to be careful with this thing. Otherwise a very good pen."
4,Cross Century II black fountain pen,The black shell & cap is a solid construction but the plastic part encasing the fountain tip is not as good.
3,not totally satisfactory,"I brought this as a gift to a senior friend. Cross is the brand that I have been looking for. However, I was kind of dissappointed when receiving it. It does not look a an high-end pen. Should I have more time, I would buy a different gift.I have no real experience using this pen."
5,Cross Century II Fountain Pen Review,"I purchased this pen for a good friend's birthday. He is a collector of various Fountain Pens. When I asked him to rate this particular pen, he said, ""I love the pen"". It writes beautifully, it don't stall and It's easy to load. My friend has a ""Lamy Studio"" pen that he favorably compared the Cross Century II pen. He said, ""I can think of nothing negative about this Cross pen, it's great!"" He rated it a 5 star! This of course made me happy because I wanted something special for his birthday and I took a chance on this particular pen. It was a bulls eye!Thank you,J.Smith"
2,OK Pen--Unless You've Been Spoiled,"I wound up returning the pen because, frankly, it did not perform up to my standards. Specifically, the ink flow was not absolutely consistent, writing with the cap on made it feel top-heavy in my hand, and the nib let through more ink than I like. I know I am picky in my writing instruments; I'll probably pony up for a Mont Blanc to replace the one I had for years."
2,Doesn't Write Very Well!,"This is a very handsome pen, which is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one. It skips constantly, providing continuous aggravation to its user. I have a fountain pen for which I paid one third of this price and it writes much better. So disappointed!"
5,Fabulous fountain pen,"I am a fountain pen lover, and this one is absolutely one of the best fountain pens I have every tried. It is very suitable for daily writing.Meanwhile, the seller Artie is very nice person. He is very patient and warm heart, I couldn't get my package on time without his help~ he is very good at doing this.Fantastic product and service! I do recommend this!"
3,Good for moderate priced fountain pen,"This pen writes well for a moderate priced pen. The pen is stylish compared to other brands at this price point. The gold plated accents dress up the pen compared to pens with steel nibs and clips. The Cross cap style, which offsets the clip well below the top of the cap, ""protrudes"" above a shirt pocket more than I prefer. Also, the pen does not have the comfortable ""heft"" or ""balance"" in my hand that I appreciate on more expensive pens. But overall, for a low cost fountain pen for daily use, the pen is good. If you lose or damage this pen through daily wear and tear, you will not lose lots of $$$"
3,Banana blow-up,"It appears that the banana is large, however it is ALOT smaller than I thought it would be. Nice product, but very small."
2,It works,"I bought this for work so I can control the music from across the gym. The remote sometimes works. For example, I have to push the remote 5 or six times before it responds. I tried changing the battery but still gives me grief."
1,Dosen't Work!,I purchased the Scosche ipod Nano RF Remote three months ago and it only worked once. I replaced the battery and it still didn't work. I emailed the company for help and never heard back. The product stinks!
1,Do not buy this book,"I have read some of this person's writing before but I don't remember it being one continuous rant against everything. This is one continuous diatribe against all things British, but American too. One wonders how he can stand to be in either country, and perhaps he shouldn't be. I had to stop after 75 pages. Perhaps that isn't giving it a fair chance but then be honest, how much can one person take? His name dropping, reference heavy, off the cuff, in your face sentences show he has read or been exposed to something. However he sure doesn't want that to happen to anyone else. Buy this book if you want, but you can sure have mine."
1,A literary Tim Allen,"I like travel books. But my traveling companion for 300 or so pages needs to be likeable, or at least insightful. Queenan is neither. He relishes being a jerk, which is fine, if at least he was funny. Unfortunately, he has the leaden sense of humor of a talk show monologue or Home Improvement episode. I see he's written a number of other books. Perhaps they're better. This one is just...tired."
1,"Awful, awful book","Is there anything Joe Queenan actually likes other than the sound of his own voice. He states his negative opinion of everything British as if it is fact. His attempts at humor fall flat and he just comes across as a self indulgent whiner who finds fault with everything.At one point he states that people who visit birthplaces of famous people such as Shakespeare are basically morons yet in a previous chapter, he himself spent a day with a cabdriver visiting Ringo Starr's aunt's house, John Lennons birthplace etc all the while listening to the cabdriver regale him with stories of how he grew up with the Beatles. All of these stories turned out to be untrue. Who's the moron now?The early Bill Bryson books are a much better read. My only consolation is that it only cost $2.98 on the bargain table. About $2.97 too much!"
4,"funnier, better written, and less mean than Bryson","Maybe Queenan is no less mean to the Brits than Bryson, but when Bryson gets cranky for the sake of humor in ""Notes from a Small Island,"" it's just not that funny. I couldn't even finish his book while on a trip to England last year. On this year's trip, I brought along ""Queenan Country"" and loved it. I was a big fan of ""Red Lobster, Blue Lagoon, and White Trash,"" and while some of the Amazon reviews for this one had me on my guard, my worries were unfounded. Queenan's knowledge of history, eye for detail, and of course caustic sense of humor make this a great read."
2,A bit dull,"Unlike most of the reviews I've read of this author and book (except the two here), I did not find much humor in this book and I didn't catch myself laughing out loud once.Queenan does a good job covering a lot of what makes the UK great: general British history, culture and tourist attractions. However, this book reads more like a dry tour guide than a humorously endearing account of all quirks British, which is what I was hoping for and expecting after reading reviews.I've given up after about 100 pages because I'm not interested in Queenan's bland retelling of his trip to the home of the Beatle's or his snide, unoriginal comments about Fergie, Madonna and other famous (infamous) British inhabitants."
1,The Agony and the Arrogance,"What could have been a satirical homage to the Mother Country is actually a tiresome, self-indulgent rant. The author's endless historical diatribes are judgmental and tasteless. His attempts at humor are consistently wide of the mark. Any entertainment value this book might have salvaged is completely overshadowed by the arrogant tone of the writing."
4,Why oh Why!?,"I love Poirot, and especially David Suchet's portrayal....BUT....Why oh Why can't Acorn provide closed captioning on their movies? I realize that the general public would never think of this option, but there are many of us that are hearing impaired and would also love to be able to enjoy many of the wonderful movies that are out there..Most other companies offer subtitles. Please Acorn, if you ever read these reviews, think about adding closed captioning for the quiet minority. I thank you for listening."
1,Come in sucker,"Perfect as David Suchet is, one only needs one copy of any Poirot movie. Buying these DVDs is like making a mystery purchase. Until Amazon is prepared to protect customers by ensuring that the titles of the movies on each DVD are listed, so that you know what you are purchasing, my strong advice is don't buy. Or try Amazon UK for more honest advertising."
5,Action with thought,"I liked all three films but I loved Dumb Witness. It had humor, murder and intelligence. I don't think any actor would play Hercule as well as David Suchet. He is an all around actor, I saw him in Executive Decision amd what a different character, a terronist of the vilest sort."
1,no sub titles,Acorn really missed the boat! These great feature long movies do not have sub-titles. There are over a million hearing impared people in the USA! What is wrong with this picture!!!! PLEASE re-release all the Poirot Movies with sub-titles!!!!!!!
3,not as good,I liked ballet shoes so since this was the sequil I wanted to read it and was disapointed. It's not as funny and there's not as many crazy adventures as the first. It also has lots of flaws that the first didn't have. But read the third shoe book called dancing shoes way better than even the first one!
2,Make Your Own Miniature Rooms,"This book is fine for reading about the rooms. But, I had hoped for more patterns to copy. There's more descriptions about the time periods themselves. I find it hard to copy a description alone. But if this suits your style, go for it."
3,political compromise receives a predictable poke,"I loved Paradise Postponed. Even the name Leslie Titmuss makes me smile. Leslie reappears here, but the attention focuses on a wimpy candidate whom it's hard to root for. All seemed a bit tired, even the humor."
3,Club Groove Deluxe Gift Set,"This toy is very fun because you can transform the bus into many things. Also it is fun to mix and match the clothes for the dolls. Some of the bad things are the parts are small and easily lost. Also the clothes can break easily. It is not educational, but fun."
5,Wonderful,The Waterford balloon glasses arrived in tact. The lismore collection is elegant and good for daily use. No reason to have unless you are going to use them.
2,"""Affair of the Necklace""- Close, but no cigar","For those of you who were left breathless by the opening credits, due to the unbelieveably powerful music, this album is not for you. Fifteen dollars and fifty some-odd minutes of my life were wasted waiting for that fantastic piece of music that never made an appearance on this otherwise tasteful, though uninspiring, album. That superb masterpiece you are looking for can be found on Jonathan Elias' CD ""The Prayer Cycle"". Again, I must remind the reader that ""The Affair of the Necklace"" soundtrack was no slouch of a hack-work; there were a great deal of pleasant and meditative niceities on it. But my reason for buying it was missing."
3,Great Deal,"I like the way it works. My only criticism is that the bottons on the remote are a bit hard to press. Otherwise, it performs exactly as advertised. Nice looking, plugs are clearly labelled. I would definitely buy it again, unless I could find a similar product, at a similar price, with a more responsive/better remote control."
3,NOT an optical-analog converter!,"I bought this thinking I could take the digital optical output from my LCD-TV, run it through the switch and have an RCA analog output to plug into my sound system. IT DOESN'T DO THIS. It only switches analog inputs to an analog output, and digital optical inputs to a digital optical output. Maybe I was naive to think otherwise, but a strict reading of the product description definitely implies that it is a converter. I'm returning this glorified A-B switch today."
4,Excellent optical audio switch,Excellent optical audio switch... with limited optical inputs on my receiver this is a great way to switch inputs without leaving the couch --- Dan
4,Cannot be replaced under warranty - not in production,"Was just what I needed. Works as advertised. The title has the con. When I tried to register, I could not find the item in the dropdown. That is because it is no longer produced. I was told that if my unit failed, it would be replaced with a switch in production."
4,Suprised at how well this works for the price,This thing is very good for the money. I use it in a professional environment and it works well manually. Remote doesn't work at all but in my application that is no big deal.
2,It works.....but,"I purchased the Digital Audio/Video A/V Source Selector Switch to switch between several digital fiber optical (Toslink) inputs and a Music Hall DAC 2.5 digital analog converter, connected to a Vincent integrated amplifier. The inputs to the switch are from my Apple TV (music) and a Pioneer plasma TV (video sound). Unfortunately, when connected through the switch, both sources produce static. It is either a problem with poor grounding or poor shielding. When I connect either input directly to the digital analog converter the sound is perfectly clean. Furthermore, the remote control for the switch doesn't work. I live and work in the state of Sao Paulo Brazil so I will not take the device back to the US to return...... I will put it storage and probably end up throwing it out when I move!!"
4,works well,"Overall the unit works well. It arrived with a stuck button, the result of a dislodged spring. Once I fixed the spring the unit worked excellent. I only use it as a Toslink audio switch. Note that the battery for the remote died rather quickly."
5,Nyrius SW200 S-Video & Optical Switcher Digital Audio Video Selector Switch with Remote,"This product did exactly what it was supposed to do. It takes up to three Optical inputs and switches between them either manually or by means of a remote control device to provide a resulting optical output. If you have a audio receiver that doesn't have enough optical input ports to handle all of your devices (cable box, DVDR, BluRay DVD, etc.), this is the perfect solution. Your devices plug into the Switcher, and the Switcher plugs into your receiver. The unit is compact and attractive.Reviewed by Michael."
4,Good value for the money,"I purchased this because I don't have enough digital inputs on my cheap Insignia receiver. This switch is a good value for the money and works well. I have never used the remote that came with the unit since there is a code to add this to my Logitech Universal Remote. I wish there were more information regarding what the range of sound this unit can process is but there are no real tech specs in the manual. To test it I played my loudest blu-ray (the UK import of Susperia) through the switcher and with the sound going directly into my receiver. I did notice a difference in the sound. The soundtrack was fuller and had more presence when the sound went directly into the receiver. However, the difference was not significant enough to be a problem for me. Still, someone who has a higher end sound system might want to consider purchasing a more expensive switcher than this. For my set-up this works fine and the sound is good.Joe"
1,OUR Racism?,"Ok, I bought this book even after reading a review that complained about just more ""white guilt"". Well it was true, the couple of chapters I managed to get through were sadly reminiscent of the 70s where if you were white you were supposed to admit that you were a racist. And I understand all that BUT, I've been around for well over half a century and I'm pretty sure I've come to grips with my ""Racism"", not that I can't always improve.HAVING SAID THAT... I passed the book on to a collogue with whom I am working and she rather liked the book -- Especially the questionnaire sections. Although some of the questions are trite, she thinks we can use it to stimulate some conversation. So, we'll see."
1,Sick and tired of white guilt,"I came to America from a country that was so violent it made the worst black ghetto look like a national park. My family was abused, tormented and casted aside like street trash.Now I come to America and I hear voices crying out against racism. I'm inclined to agree, as I've experienced racism. However, the American definition is different. It basically means ""Whitey is evil. He holds everyone down. Everyone else is ok, but white people are bad""Nice to see that the people who march against racism are able to acknowledge all forms of racism. Oh wait...they don't."
2,Weak,Old film and dosent look like IMAX hardly at all. Sound were cool though.Rent It but not really worth the time.Peace
1,Que dire???,"Premier livre que je lis de cet auteur pourtant si chaudement recommandée!!! Incapable de le terminer, c'est peu dire...A éviter...Il s'y passe tout simplement rien. Faudra tre très convaincant pour me faire lire un autre livre de S. Laurens."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,I honestly came to amazon.com to warn everyone not to read this book there is absolutely no point. Nothing exciting happens - NOTHING! The author must have had her mind on something besides her writing.
1,Horrible,This book was boring and aggravating. I didn't even like the leading man and I HATED how the woman was written. I actually threw the book across the room in disgust. Definitely don't buy this one.
2,not her best work,"i returned this book the day i got it. i'm glad i got my money back. atleast borrow THIS book from a library, because you know that you can return it, without wasting your money. the best part of the book was the ending, with the roses. that was about it."
5,"A tender, emotional story with likeable characters","This is the kind of story which originally inspired me to buy Stephanie Laurens, but I'm not surprised by some of the other reviews ... because they sound as disappointed as I'd sound if I reviewed Laurens' more recent books. Vive la difference!I got so disappointed by cardboard characters and thin to nonexistent plots as an excuse for 300+ pages of erotica in her recent stuff that I quit buying her books about a year and a half ago ...But THIS one, a Regency rather than an historical, is a treasure, one that reminds me of Mary Balogh and Mary Jo Putney's early books, which I also keep and re-read often."
2,Very Disappointing,"Although, I love the author Stephanie Laurens this has to be one of the most boring books she has ever written. Stephanie Laurens is a great author but the problem is that she is too repetitious with her novels. She uses the same plot over and over again: the heroine is reluctant to marry the man she loves because she does not want to lose her independence! She used this plot in the Bar Cynsters and even that theme got tired! I seriously recommend that you not buy this book because you will be disappointed! I was."
4,I thought it was good,"I really liked this book, although I would have liked to have read an epilogue. I'm not sure the relation to the Cynster's as they were not mentioned in this book at all.This book is definitely not like the more steamier ones we're used to reading from Ms. Laurens, she left that to your imagination and for that it was refreshing as I tend to get numb to the creative ways that an author describes the act of love-making. One tends to read that a lot."
2,I found it disappointing,"I'm pregnant with my second and was looking forward to lots of practical advice about preparing my toddler, myself, and my husband for the new arrival. I found the section on when and how to tell the first child about the new baby was totally inadequate. It doesn't address different ages at all - yet there must be a difference in when and how you present the information to an 18 month old, a three year old, or a four year old. The book was packed with anxiety-provoking scenarios of resentful and frustrated children and parents, unhelpful observations (some parents do this random thing, some parents do that random thing), and ridiculously obvious advice (have two children to lug around? Consider a double stroller - wow, I wouldn't have thought of that on my own!). I found it to be a waste of time. I'm reading Siblings without Rivalry, now. It's much more focused and useful."
2,Do not purchase this book!,"One can only hope the children of this author do not pick up and read this book any time soon. They will be so disheartened to hear how unhappy their mother was with having a second child. I read Ms. Weiss' book with the continued hope of hearing the positive side of having more than one child. Apparently in her eyes, there isn't one.There is a lot of practical and positive advice out there. Not to say this journey in parenthood is easy, but it is definitely not as joyless as the author would have you think"
2,Mothers Pregnant with their second Child...Don't Read this Book!!!,"This book was extremely disappointing. I am pregnant with my second child and I purchased this book looking for a way to introduce our second child into my first childs life, and into our new family. I found this book caused me more anxiety than answered my questions. I dont feel that this is an accurate view of how life with a second child would be. I do not recommend this book and agree with several of the other reviews, this book is very gloomy at a time when you should be looking forward to the growth of your family."
1,I wish I had not started it...,"I have read the first 3 chapters (110 pages) of this book - and am going to pack it away in the back of my closet. I am pregnant with my second, and was hoping for advice on how/when to introduce the idea to my daughter...practical advice for moving her out of the crib and into a new room...etc. I cannot speak for the whole book, but the first three chapters pretty much consist of stories of how you are ruining your first-born's life by having another. It was not practical, not enjoyable to read, and has only made me more anxious than I need to be."
3,Good read.....,"The author is a very good writer. She wrtites about emeging consumer trends. Although I am not sure how radical the ideas are and not sure it will change my life. Davis contends that Americans' desires have shifted in recent years, from the physical to the metaphysical. One other book I like that relate these ideas to what brand does is 60-Minute Brand Strategist by Idris Mootee. It covers quite of those metaphysical stuff."
1,Beware is right,"I wish I had read his review (and the first review) before I bought one. This is the PERFECT machine - except for that lousy hard drive. Made that click every time it accessed the disk. Drove me crazy. The system lasted only 15 minutes before I took it back. Checked the demo in a retail store and it did it too. If you care about noise at all, stay AWAY from this computer. Broke my heart to return it. Can't find a thing with similar specs. If only Compaq would put 16MB of video ram into their 1720 instead of 8MB, that would do it. Or if Toshiba put a Intel-M instead of a regular Intel into the 5005. Oh, well. Guess I'll wait for the next wave of laptops..."
4,Good Leary; Verrrry gooooooddddddd,Hi; welcome to all Wilson; Icke; Mckenna and Leary fans.This book has been the first book that i have read of Tiothy Leary. I am impressed by his humor; wit and most of all the way he can see past the system that has been given to us.I will have to look further into the phenonemon of timothy leary; like wilson and look at some more of his books.
2,Numbingly Stupid,"Having read this one book of Leary's, I'm not sure if the title of this review refers to the book or the reader :) Some of the history of the 1960s drug culture contained in this book was interesting. However, the interesting historical tidbits occur randomly with little clear context or relationship to the rest of the book. In fact, this volume reads not like a book but rather like so many unrelated paragraphs. Most paragraphs make some degree of sense by themselves but there is little if any connection from one paragraph to another. The book is a context-free mish-mash of history, scientific classifications of experience and art, rants against modern society, scholarly analysis of the history of science and philosophy, and personal resentments.Perhaps I haven't re-imprinted my brain sufficiently, or perhaps I've not re-imprinted it closely enough to Leary's own re-imprinting, or perhaps I'm just dumb. Either way, I didn't get much out of this book."
3,Not read yet,Ihave not read this book. I've just heard of it because of Leary's connections with mystic stuff. If you've read it I'd be glad to hear from you.
3,middle of the road,"I have not had the reception problems that others have had. And I do find the time set up annoyingly long. And I have been able to carry my phone outside and got perfect reception, which has been extremely helpful on more than one occasion. BUT... the rechargeable battery drains VERY quickly, and you have about 10-15 seconds warning (beeps) before you get disconnected -- not at all good. The primary reason I bought this one instead of a panasonic as I have before was it's shape. My cat liked to walk on the panasonic (all the ones on sale where I was shopping were basically flat) and I got tired of my messages starting at 3am; I have to admit the triangular shape is very succesful in discouraging late night walks by adventurous felines."
2,Reception stinks --very disappointed,"Don't let the looks fool you. Yes, it's a little cutie, but it's all on the surface. My 5 year old 900mhz phone has better clarity and reception.I exchanged it because the reception was so bad. Snap-Crackle-Pop!Also had an echo problem along with the snapping, crackling, and popping. I would not recommend this phone."
2,Not a very good phone,"The battery life seemed to be pretty good. You could hear it ring pretty clearly. The answering machine speaker is not very clear. When using the handset we would always hear a clicking noise. When we would call people they say they hear an echo. We are going to buy a new phone and you can be asured it will NOT be a GE phone,"
1,Ready to toss mine,"We bought this phone about a year ago. I didn't want to buy it them but the wife really liked this one over the others that we were looking at. From day one it has been a disappointment. The moajority of the time when I try tu use the phone, it will not complete the call, and lately it has gotten worse. From 10 ft. away even though you can hear the beep of each button being pressed, the base doesn't seem to recognize all of the beeps. Multiple dialings of the same phone number finally results in a successful connection.It is cheap (price as well as quality)It does feel comfortable in the handGood for target practiceVery aggravating to deal withCallerID doesn't always workProblems arise within the first month of useOverall I would not purchase this phone again even for someone I didn't like. My recommendation is to skip this phone and pay a little more and get a better one or if you want a really good phone, purchase one of the Panasonic 2.4GHz portables, you will be very pleased."
3,Not Bad,"The reception is somewhat good, however, being stationed overseas, I make somewhat long telephone calls back to the states and the charge never seems to last. Also, before the phone dies, it only gives about what seems to be a one minute notice before conking out."
1,Why have caller ID When you can hardly see it!,"I bought this phone because of the caller ID on the handset. You cannot adjust the contrast, and there is no ID on the base. I can hardly see the number on the screen. The reception is also terrible. I constantly have to ask people to repeat themselves. No adjustment on ringer,but on and off. You get what you pay for. Buy a panasonic."
2,too much hiss,"I should have read these reviews more carefully before obtaining this product. For a cordless phone, I expect that the sound quality will be poorer than a corded phone, but not this bad. The hiss and static comes from out of no where and changing the channels does nothing to stop it. I'd rather go back to my corded phone.There is also no volume adjustment on the ringer. It's either on or off."
2,Short Range - Bad Reception,I agree with other reviews... this phone has week reception... you have to pump-up the volume to hear people on the phone. You sometimes have to run to the base station because the signal sounds like it is going to drop-out. Look at some other phone. The programming of names and numbers is a complete nightmare.
2,this WAS a great phone,"I've had this phone for a little over a year. When I first got it I thought it was the best phone on the planet: cool looking, good sound, 2.4gig (analog or not). One day, all of a sudden, it just started spontaneously hanging up on people I was talking to. It hasn't stopped hanging up on people ever since. I am now totally ""afraid"" to use the thing because I never know who it's going to hang up on next."
1,Don't buy this phone,"Very disappointed with this phone. Phone does not hold its charge, sometimes will not pick up at all. When the phone does work the reception is poor!"
2,Poor Performer,This was a great phone. It started malfunctioning 9 months after buying it. Thumbs down.
2,"Features a plenty, including plenty of static","Bought the non Caller ID version of this phone as a replacement for my older GE cordless phone a couple of days ago. Needed the mute and headset capability during business calls. Although I found the digital answering machine to be quite good, allowing you to manage messages with ease, the STATIC was so prevalent that talking for any longer then a minute or two is unbearable. Even switching channels does nothing to improve the static. Disappointing as I wanted to like this GE phone. Will be returning it today."
1,Don't Buy this phone is HORRIBLE,"The worst Phone ever! Static, unable to clearly hear or talk. works when it feels like it.. answering machine is annoying and works when it wants too... looking for that reciept.. i'll pay the $ for a panasonic.. again.. you get what you pay for..."
1,I would return it if weren't too late!,The sound volume decreased with time and after about a month it is so low that the phone is unuseable.
2,You get what you pay for,It takes forever to charge and is difficult to charge since it has to be positioned just right or it wont connect with charger
1,say that again,"I bought this phone as a backup to my 900mhz Panasonic and it is terrible. I find myself constantly asking people to speak up because I can't hear them behind the static. My own voice comes through too loud, and makes for a frustrating experience. My older cordless works much better under the same circumstances. I'll be selling mine online, and I'll start looking for a replacement immediatly."
1,Horrible Phone,"This was another GE mess up, horrible static, you cant leave the base without fuzz or whistling. I hated it, not a good choice!"
4,Quite Good,"I'll make it short. The Destiney's Child is a great band, but this CD single is just plain. The Bee Gees written Emotion is sang by them, but these mixes made it sound a little bit strange."
1,Not Good enough for Queen,"My road bike (about $2k) was locked in a cage in a luxury apartment complex on the East River. Clearly the thieves knew what they were doing because they got into the locked cage without breaking the doors. Whatever they used cut through my cable like butter. I'm not knocking Brinks AND I'm not saying it may be one of the best bike locks on the market BUT DO NOT believe that this cable cannot be cut in a matter of seconds with the right tools.Of course if you have used this cable and still have your bike, then it hasn't failed you yet..."
1,Fit note is incorrect,"Amazon says that these valve stem seals will fit on a 1993 Dodge Stealth ES DOHC. Note: This does NOT fit a DOHC engine. I took my car to the dealer to have them install these vavle stem seals but they were not able to because these only fit the SOHC model. Do not get this product if you are looking to replace your valve stem seals on your DOHC Stealth/3000GT. I understand that this product sells in sets of 12 and not 24 which should have been a tip off to me but usually for DOHCs you buy per head so it was not unusual. The Engine model listed on Amazon to fit this product is ""3.0L V6 Gas DOHC Distributorless Naturally Aspirated SFI Electronic FI MFI""; note the DOHC piece which is what I relied on.This is not the only time Amazon.com has been wrong with what fits my Dodge Stealth. I had a similar issue with the thermostat. I will find it difficult to purchase auto parts from Amazon going forward."
5,A Splendid Norma!,"I sought out this recording particularly for Elinor Ross - one of many great sopranos neglected by the commercial recording studios. I'm very glad I found it for this, in my opinion, is one of the best recordings of Norma. Ross has the right emotional temperment for Norma and her singing remains quite beautiful and well paced throughout the entire opera. The coloratura is handled quite well and the ""Casta Diva"" is superb. Fiorenza Cossotto is in excellent form and her voice blends well with that of Ross - their duet ""Mira, o Norma"" is a highlight of the recording. The live recording is clear, forward and full. I would highly recommend this recording."
5,Brava,"Dame Joan Sutherland is the Queen of opera, and she is at her best here. I love this CD. Buy it, you will not be disappointed. BRAVA! She has the most incredible high notes I've ever heard!"
2,Just Good,"Bellini - I Puritani / SutherlandGood, but can't hold a candle to the Phila performance with Gedda, Diaz etc. simply because EVERY singer that nite was ""GLORIOUS"" Was released on SRO and hopefully they will do so again. Was there that nite and will NEVER forget it."
5,I Am Sam Score,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
5,John Powell,"Another great & moving score from Powell. This is not large and bombastic score as Shrek or Evolution, but still so fresh an beatufull. Especially cello parts. This album is a proof, that John Powell is a fantastic composer.He can do action score as well as comedy or drama."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"After seeing the wonderful movie, ""I AM SAM"" and tremendously enjoying what I thought would be the sound track, I ordered the CD right away - it is NOT what I expected. I thought I'd be hearing all those great Beatles songs as they were sung on the movie - not a one! I am bummed!"
2,Weird movie...,"Well I didn't like this movie. Although it was very interesting to see how people used to live at that time, the plot itself didn't do it for me... I didn't get it, it was just too weird for me and didn't make much sense.Concerning the quality of the DVD (picture / sound) it is quite bad on a new flat screen... greyish picture tones, a little blurry and weak sound. Looks like a copy of an older VHS tape despite the ""remastered"" statement. No subtitles either."
1,The only good thing was the MST 3K episode that followed.,"The only good thing about this movie was the MST 3K episode that followed. The ""professional"" dancing was a joke, the plot was pointless, and the song that plays in the background of nearly every scene will be stuck in your head for weeks."
1,TWENTY THREE BUCKS!?!?!,"Twenty three bucks for the non-MST3K version? You've got to be kidding me. This should be in the dollar bin with Bela Legosi's Devil Bat. Multiple editing botches, drunken father abuse, old guys dealing in drugs, awful dancing choreography, a protagonist named Critter, and you expect someone to shell out twenty-three bucks to see it? Forget that. I paid ten bucks for the non-MST3K version of Werewolf and that was a horrible decision on my part.Girl in Gold Boots is a worthless movie, but it shines as an MST3K episode. That's the only way this piece of refuse can ever be worth twenty-three bucks. Get the MST3K version. You won't regret it."
1,IDEOTIC MOVIE!!!!!1,"THIS MOVIE TOTALLY SUCKS!!!!I JUST GOT THE EPISODE ON MST3K THIS PAST WEEK,EVEN THEY COULD NOT MAKE FUNNY JOKES OUT OF IT.ALL I CAN SAY IS o/THIS MOVIE SUCKS,IT REALLY REALLY SUCKS,MOVIE SUCKKKKKKKKSSSSS/O"
1,it sucks!!!!,"ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS,IT SUUUCCKKKS! I JUST GOT ONE OF THE MST3K EPISODES ON THIS FLICK AND EVEN THEY WERE RUNNING DRY OF JOKES,NEVER,EVER EVER EVER,NEVER GET THIS MOVIE A WAST OF MONEY!!!"
4,"Lyric, inventive, witty",I thoroughly enjoyed several of the stories in the book. Chenoweth is a wonderfully witty writer.
5,"tight prose, controlled emotion, an impressive debut","Like John Cheever, Chenoweth's stories take aim at family life, leaving comet tails of insight and humor along their path to the target. Bullseye. Dead center."
3,Should have got a bigger harddrive...,"I ran out of harddrive just after loading the needed software and after a few heavy duty photoshoots. I cranked up the RAM and use External Harddrives to get a movie done, but tied me down to a desk. (defeats purpose of ""laptop"")By the way, my battery swelled to 2"" thick and literally rocked my laptop! Just before exploding, they switched it out. Then the powercord caught on fire! Hmmm...I had to go through applecare for that and they eventually believed me that I didnt do it from negligence and replaced that.Now, in just a few months my battery is once again faulty and wont hold a charge. As soon as I unplug it, the computer shuts down with no saving then has to reboot from start.Rosetta not kicking in either and the Mac techs at the local shop don't know how to turn it on...oh boy! I stick to ALL mac products since to load windows will leave me no space to have FUN!Good thing I have applecare....right? THE GOOD THING: I saved $600 off retail here at Amazon! :)"
2,"Low quality, rushed production","We've gone through two of these, and both have had significant problems. In addition to the oft-cited heat issues, the machines occasionally hang. Often, they don't come out of sleep properly, requiring a hard reset.It's pretty clear at this point that Apple really rushed these initial Intel-based laptops to get them on the market. It's probaly best to wait until the next generation ones come out either later this year or early next. For one, the next gen models will use the Core 2 processors, which are phenomenal and will reduce power consumption while giving an almost 100% boost to speed. Second, more applications will have been ported to the Intel architecture by then.Unless you absolutely have to have an intel Mac now, I'd recommend waiting for the second generation laptops."
3,Beware the Glitch in WORD,"Though fast, this computer keyboard does NOT function on the control/Home or control/End. As someone who works in long documents, this is incredibly frustrating. When I called Mac for assistance they said it was a Microsoft problem. After hours with Microsoft, it proves to be a keyboard (ie. MAC) problem - when i attached a separate keyboard the keys did the proper function. Mac simply advised that i use the Scroll to get to the beginning/end of documents. On a forty, or fifty page piece, this is not useful."
1,"Totally defective, poor design","My father and I each bought one of these computers, to make a long story short, my fathers has been serviced 3 times, and mine once, they both overheat, randomly shut down in the middle of use, the CD drives both malfunctioned and had to be replaced. The list goes on, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!"
1,Problem from day 1,I was so excited when My new computer came via UPS that day ordered from Amazon.com My favorite place to shop :) After unpacking and inspecting the computer I realized the cd/dvd players drivers were not installed. After 3 calls to Toshiba totaling about 4 hours of time I was told I would have to pack it up and ship it to them to fix or pay 350 dollars for an on-site warranty soooooo I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon and ordered a Hewlett Packard instead through Amazon. A lot of people have problems with the fans in these also its a pretty pretty computer too bad its has so many bugs operationally.
2,Warning - the screen will fry your eyeballs!,"The screen on this machine will blind you! The whiteness is way too bright and dazzles your eyes, even if you turn the brightness down (all this does is make all the other colors dark, the white still dazzles!) This happens even if you hook up an external monitor.Wonderful machine with amazing specs., but un-useable because of the too-bright screen. Also, no way to access the BIOS."
5,"Vocalist for ""Never Stop Loving You""","I just wanted to say thank you for purchasing the CD and giving your honest opinion. I strive hard to ensure that you are getting good quality music for a quality rate. Email me to hear about other projects completed and in the works. I have another CD on Amazon titled IMPACT. Check it out and feel free to purchase/review. Myself, TKA and other groups are available for bookings. Please email for info. {{Shadow}} P.S. Lemme know if you hear it on your local radio station."
4,"Freestyle fanatic from South San Francisco, CA.","This is a great CD. The beats will keep your subs pounding (hopefully without blowing them) and the mixes are very well done. Willie Valentin is great. I recommend this CD to all freestyle fans. The Spanish songs bothered me a little bit because the beats are so nice and they're not in our language ! But that's ok, still a great CD."
3,its alright,its good for the price but my first one blew out after just 18 months. but for the price its pretty decent
2,1500 3D marks 03....weak,"athlonxp 3200+ 400FSB, 512mb dual channel, nForce2 Ultra. I assumed that the 5500 256MB was a higher level card, but it's just a tiny step above a 5200. Radeon 9550 and 9600 (non pros) beat this card with only 128mb. I only paid $53 for it, but for $100 you can get a 9800 Pro and it will pull 5700 on 3D marks 03."
4,Good Card,This is a good card I purchased it as an upgrade and it installed fine but I needed to download a new driver from the manufacturer's site to get the pixel shader to work for the lego star wars game. Other than that it has been fine.
5,now I can see,We got the card so the boys can play the games that they got for their b-days. I was surprised at how much clearer everthing was.
4,Great value,This Video card is a great value if you a older computer... I play madden 2008 with no problem.
4,Nice Agp card much more worth than the money u pay for it!,"Guys i took this graphic card in march 2006. And 2 b fair its kindda amazing card for so little bucks.i got this graphic card as i didnt have an PCI-E slot on my motherboard.I hve an intel 845 GV chipset so the best card that i could put would be the FX 5 series.To be honest i could have put FX 5900 but then i had realised that it gave same perfomance as the FX 550 did.so i went for the FX 5500 256 Mb card.and guys dont underestimate this card cause its 256 MB and gives amazing graphics.but i woulsnt reccommend this card for hardcore gamers as u would have to play with lower settings.but most of the new games work amazing with this little card out there!Nd there are no hang ups or system crashes.plus the video clarity and the colours are azmzing ,i got this fora bout 25$ in a sale.iAnd i am pleased to say that i am really satisfied with itSo guys go fot this card if u have a low budget and stil need amazing perfomance."
2,No good with newer LCD Monitors,"Have a Dell Dimension 4550 - with an old (circa 2003 video card) that needed replacing. Purchased this card due to low cost. Easy to install - no extra power cable needed - feeds off the AGP slot. However, this card is NOT powerful enough to run today's bigger LCD monitors. I purchased a 24 inch Dell LCD Monitor and my graphics with this card are fair. I have now purchased a 6800 GS to replace this one. I have seen friends using the 6800 on their older machines and the images are worth the extra U$150 dollars - especially if you are gaming with COD2 or UT2004. The other players continually whack you with this card because you can't respond as quickly as they can. Bottom-line - this card is adequate for a CRT monitor (I tested it on my 19inch and it looked great), but can't push enough pixels to satisfy a bigger LCD Monitor. Spend the extra money and jump to a 6800 GS if you plan on going LCD."
2,Not working on my PC,"This product is not listed with microsoft as compatible with Windows XP. Meaning that if it will not work, they will not help.And it wont work for long on my desktop. Strange, because I have the PCI version on another PC running XP Pro, and its perfect.Guess its just my luck..."
4,"HUGE Bang for the buck, IF YOU CAN INSTALL IT","I was so mad at first because I could not install this card. Things had to be rearranged like the motherboard, etc. My buddy is a computer genius and it even confused him, only for a minute though. After putting the clues together he figured it out and MAN am I surprised. THE GRAPHICS ARE GORGEOUS. Did not expect this. It really brings out the color in FULL DETAIL in the games. BATTLEFIELD 2 was real dull looking before I had this card installed. Also there is barely any lag in the games. It is very SMOOTH.(CUT OF A COUPLE OF TIMES THOUGH) MAN WHAT A DIFFERENCE. For 55 dollars this IS A FLAT OUT ROBBERY, but certain people will have problems installing this, GUARANTEED."
5,Great Video Card,The NVIDIA e-Force vidio card is great. My Grandson is now able to do video gaming across the web to his best friends house. Dueling video games. He is very happy with the purchase and that makes me happy.
4,Good gamecard for a decent price,"This was a very reasonable buy, I bought the card solely to play the game Lord of the Rings the Battle for Middle Earth II. It can play the game on my computer on Medium Definition settings without any drag, though if it is set on high or ultra-high it begins to drag quite a bit. But it's a large game and for a cheaper gamecard performs very well. I would highly recommend this to people who are casual gamers like I am."
1,Annoyed,"While doing some research before i bought this, I read that it was compatible with AGP and PCI slots. When it came today I triedt oput it in one of the three PCI slots on my computer and it won't fit. So now I have a useless $75 video card."
4,Definite Improvement,"I purchased this item to improve the graphical preformance of my relatively old Dell Dimension computer. In World of Warcraft and Civilization IV there was a marked graphical improvement, and the pixel blurring that had been bothering me was eliminated. Unfortunately the computer has begin to fail, not surprising due to it's age, and so it looks like this card will be finding a new home soon.A very solid purchase, though I imagine it will be pretty out of date within a year or two."
4,Decent card for older computers,"I bought this card so I could upgrade an old computer (Dell 2400 w/ a P4 @ 2.6 w/ 2G RAM) to be able to play some online games (Guild Wars). I also had to upgrade the power supply, so that's the only negative, but in the end it was a worthy investment. For under $70 (both card and PS) I was able to update my computer enough to handle most modern games. Runs smooth, no problems with the interface - I'm satisfied with using the VGA output to my 42"" LCD TV. Yeah, it isn't as ""crisp"" as an HD image, but it's still hella better than an old-style monitor (CRT).Not the least bit unhappy with this.I'm running the PCI version of this card."
4,great card,"We got this card for our new HP, because there were certain games I wanted to play like HL2, and Doom3. The preformance upgrade was like night and day over my MX400. It isn't top of the line, but running Doom 3 on 1024*768, 8x AA, and high video settings, I was able to score 23 fps on the time demo. When I overclocked this card to 320/450 opposed to hte standard 270/400, I saw on average, a 5-10 fps jump in all my games. After that, the only time HL2 lagged was when I was near water, and even then I could still score 25fps. Doom 3 shot up from 23fps to 28, which makes a large difference in gameplay smoothness. Overall, not the best card if your going to be gaming a lot, unless you plan to overclock. But still can handle todays generation of games very nicely, with room to spare. All together, 8 out of 10 stars.My other specs-AMD ATHLON 64 3300+ running at 2.4GHz512MB COrsair PC3200Maxtor 160GB 7200rpm hd1024*768 16 inch LCD"
3,Gray lines is a joke,"Please don't listen to the guy complaining obout gray lines on his nVidia video card. The card he was using was a RIVA TNT card that came out in 1998. Get a life.I have owned nVidia products for years with no problem. I have a PNY geforce2-ti-4200 now and have had no problems whatsoever period.The problem is most likely a cheap manufacturer, since nVidia licenses its tech to 3rd parties for production. Buy the card from a reputable manufacturer like eVGA, ASUS, LeadTek, Chaintech, or MSI.By the way, if you're looking for the best framerate, look elswhere, the 5200-5600 series were meant for a value market, not top-end gaming framerate. If you want to play Doom-3, and Halflife-2 best info I have is to buy at least a fx5900 ultra 256mb."
4,If you have ever visited any of the Metroparks in Cleveland!,"My husband's grandfather gave him a subscripition to the Emerald Necklace newsletter when he was a young boy. I bought this book for his dad because he is a Cleveland history buff. When Jim saw it, he mentioned how the Emerald necklace would always remind him of his grandfather who used to take him to the various parks around their neighborhood. If you live in Cleveland, you must have this book. It depicts all of the parks in seasonal splendor and even if you haven't visited them all, you will appreciate what a ""gem"" we have here in Cleveland in the Emerald Necklace. Thanks to Gary for bringing back fond childhood memories for my husband and the family and creating a keepsake for generations to come!"
3,Not as bad as most books in this series.,"Just a little obscure...but this book in the series was actually readable! Still pretty incoherent, but i think thats mainly due to the setting."
4,good quality,I am overall happy with these. They may have to stretch out depending on your foot so there may be a break in period. One thing I noticed is that they smelled funny when I got them so I washed them first to get rid of it.
4,Tabi socks,"I've ordered these tabi socks a number of times and been satisfied each time. Make sure you carefully follow the instructions for picking the right size. It's not your shoe size.I use them for aikido which I practice three or four hours a week. They fit great and have the right level of friction with the mat. The only problem I have is that they only last six months. And by that time, they're full of holes. Maybe that's to be expected. Socks probably wouldn't last that long. It just seems like I ought to be able to get more than a hundred hours of use out of them. I haven't found anything better, though."
2,Tabi or not Tabi,"Tabi are excellent Japanese quality construction & materials. The length was spot-on following the ordering directions. The product failure is that the width of the Tabi is narrow. I wear ""D"" width shoes which I assumed are the most common/normal width in the USA. Narrow width may be remedied by continued wear to stretch the Tabi. However, the big toes are too uncomfortably tight! I don't think that there is any hope of getting the toes to stretch. People with Narrow feet and thin toes may find this product to their liking."
1,Amazon non-responsive to lost subscription,Discover claims they didn't receive my add-on subscription and I can't find a way to get Amazon (who got the money) to do anything to fix the problem. I have had two other subscriptions go ok but not this one. If you click on the problem link it just sends an email to the publisher no way it seems to get a Amazon person involved.
4,Quick delivery,The only thing I do not completely comfortable is too much commercial.Issues are good. :}
2,8th grader quality? or 6th grader,"I used to enjoyed Discover, but the past several months of their radicals changes, got me to think a real dumbing down.Once in awhile, they would put together a good article - but not constantly.How can we enlighten ourselves and improve our intelligence on science etc in the world stage.There are still many of us that do not want to be glued to the computer for science as we would for the tv.Discover's editorial staff ought to get their magazine back on track or the circulation and subscriber base is going to go down the tube. Thank goodness Scientific American, Astronomy, Sky and Telescope, Science News havent fallen down.I am not renewing my subscription unless Discover 'rediscovers' itself.How dumb Americans are!?"
2,Disappointing,"Edit:I encourage people to give this magazine a second chance, four years later. I haven't checked up on it in that time, but some indicate that the quality has gone up significantly since Discover embarked on its new look. -- 06/28/10"
3,Good,"This is a fun magazine. The material presented is interesting (depending on one's taste), clear, and varied. It is the science magazine I started reading as an elementary school student many years ago after being attracted by pretty pictures of dinosaurs. I recommend this magazine for people who are not professional scientists but are interested in either learning or being exposed to science-related information. This magazine is good, but not fantastic. Maybe I am hard to please."
2,Not nearly as reliable as Scientific American,"I'm retired, and refuse to give up Scientific American, which I've taken--more or less without interruption--since age 19. DISCOVER is enjoyably written but just look at all the apologies for errors in the next issue! The difference is that about 85% of SciAm's articles are by real scientists & technologists reporting on their work. In Discover, almost none are written by scientists, but by science or tech writers, whose knowledge is often superficial.It's OK for the less science-educated public--but I worked in technology most of my career, caught too many obvious errors, and won't take it again.At least the magazine isn't affiliated with that boneheaded ""Discovery"" channel on cable! The magazine used to have an occasional little icon in the back pages telling people that they were not."
1,Used to be great. Now it's just hearsay pop science crap.,"It's just disappointing where this magazine has gone. Last month, I had the ""pleasure"" of reading a bombastic self-description of how a surgeon saved a patient's airway from his anesthesiologist. The article was so narcissistic and the story was so improbable for anybody who works in an operating room, that I'm 100% sure it was never fact-checked, not to speak about running it by an independent expert.Since then, I don't trust what I read there, and the magazine is too glossy for toilet paper, so I'll just cancel the subscription."
4,Love to read it from cover to cover,I really enjoy this magazine. It is easy reading and lets me keep a pulse on the world of science. For anyone who loves the world of science and technology.
2,I was disappointed,"I expected it to be better. I subscribed last year, looking for a good magazine for the family, and decided on Discover. There is the occasional interesting tidbit, but the issues are generally pretty lean, have few photographs, and are for the most part, boring.The latest issue with the bald, fat, naked man was just about the last straw for me and Discover magazine. I definitely will not be re-subscribing."
2,Discover,"The web site confused me and the subscription, meant for our son, indicated that it would be sent to me. I then called Discover magazine to change the address. I could only speak my concern to a computer, but the magazine is now sent to my address."
4,Discovery Magazine,It was amazing how fast we received our first issue. Since then we have received two more.
1,Beware! Never shows up,"Don't order magazines from Amazon! I don't know if this is a publisher issue or what but I ordered June 4, 2008, still no magazine by Sep 30, 2008. Amazon (after multi holds etc.) tells me that I am on my own with the publisher. Will reverse charges. Poor service!!!"
5,Exploring New Things,"This was a gift to my son-in-law, so I'm not completely familiar with the magazine. It looks to be a good source for up-to-date scientific information. It appears to present technical information in an easy to read format, and seems to contain nice illustrations to support the information presented."
3,Isnt a Nature magazine but is good,"if you are a normal person than like to ready but isnt a deep fan of science this magazine is for you, very simple reading, inside you will have all the headlines and trend news of the moment. the negative side is to much merchandizing and advertisement , the news a very short with an over all feeling. Positive sides: price very accessible and on top of the biggest new in science out there."
1,Discover Old Hat,"I have subscribed to Discover magazine for years but have recently cancelled my subscription. The magazine, which once served up well written news of present and future science has become a hack rag. From juvenile sexual humor and associated photos couched under the guise of science to supposed factual articles that seem ripped from my local papers Op-Ed page, the whole magazine has degraded into a worthless pile of trash."
1,On the brink of ceasing publication?,"I've witnessed many of my favorite magazines cease publication over the years, so based on those experiences, it looks like Discover will go kaput sometime in the next 1 to 3 years. It's unfortunate, but right now this publication's continued existence is solely based on inertia.Discover used to be somewhere between Omni and Scientific American, but recently they've been adding an odd mixture of content that you would normally find in Popular Science, Wired, and Time magazine - all in a flimsy 80 pages. It has turned into a brochure with 2-page ads disguised as articles for computer equipment (external hard drives). See pages 26-27 of the February 2009 issue.I'll stick around until the end, but for those just subscribing I would recommend doing so in 1-year increments."
1,Recently very bad,"I had a subscription to this magazine for almost 10 years, and I always read every article with interest. In the past 6 months, nearly every article has been a disappointment, either filled with fluffy, quasi-science or written by an author with an obvious bias. The latest issue came with a promotional CD from an oil company, and had an article about how fossil fuel emissions were not responsible for global warming. If that isn't a sign of what's gone wrong with Discover, I don't know what is.If there is a dramatic improvement in the next few months, I might consider resubscribing, but likely not."
5,Discover magazine rocks!,"I love Discover magazine. It tells you all the latest science news slightly ""dumbed down"" a bit so that the average person can understand."
2,Not What I Remember,"I remember reading Discover as a teen. So, last year when my daughter did a magazine fund raiser through school, I signed up for a year. After my first issue, I know I will not be signing up for another year.This ""new"" Discover reads like a tree-huggers guide to science. It has so many environmental/global warming stories that I cannot take it as an unbiased scientific magazine.You have been warned. Non-hippies need not apply."
1,"Old news, Bad customer service","I purchased a gift subscription to Discover in October 2009, indicating that it was a Christmas gift. They didn't send a gift notification card, and didn't bother sending the magazine until the March 2010 issue. When I contacted them about it, they didn't even apologize.As for the magazine itself, my gift recipient was appalled by the ad-to-content ratio, and found that most of the articles were old news that he'd already read about online by the time the magazine arrived."
3,Good magazine but poor service,"I subscribed this magazine as a gift to my kids. They liked it a lot. I renewed it after one year. According to the instructions, they will adjust the subscription renewal so that we will not receive duplicates. However, when I checked, the kids did receive duplicate issues. I think the service needs to be improved."
4,discover overall,"I like the content, but the format (flow) is not smooth. Examples would be sky and telescope and astronomy. Sorry, they just catch the eye."
5,Stands the test of Time,"I'm a single guy, a civil engineer and a Discovery Channel fan. I have started and let many different subscriptions expire including Golf Digest, Maxim, Blender, FHM, Mens Health and others... Discover is the ONLY one I continue to renew over and over for the past 5 years running.... my friends that come over, single or not, end up reading through Discover more than any other. Its for that nerd in each one of us that needs something more than shallow articles about relationships and ""who did what"" in Hollywood gossip. Excellent read for anyone with 30% or more of a brain."
3,Science for the layman,Excellent magazine to update oneself on current scientific developments. Weird collection of ads though for a science oriented journal!
3,Good for Overview,"I'm a business and computer guy but I enjoy staying educated and so I tried Discover, Popular Science, and Scientific America. Frankly, Discover doesn't educate much. The articles are shallow and don't provide me with much more than I get from other sources that I already read. However, it does cover a wide variety of topics, warranting a subscription. Of the three mentioned, Discover is the easiest to read."
2,Yawn.....glad it's free after rebate,Poker game was only game I played. Says the players were interactive. How? All they did was fidget. I play the real game w/ friends and lose money. Play PC game if you don't like to lose real money.
2,pedestrian,"At the risk of encountering serious bodily harm, the very young Thesiger manages to overcome many hardships and much opposition on his trek through the deserts of southern Abyssinia, but you have to read between the lines to get many thrills."
5,This is my favorite of all of Ray Bradbury's works.,"Except for ""The Halloween Tree"", Quicker Than the Eye"" is my all time favorite of Ray Bradbury's works! Every story is full of wonderful descriptive language and stimulating plots. This is the first anthology I have read in which I loved every story!"
3,Not the complete version.,"This book is missing a whole chapter from the original edition. There is a paperback in print which has everything. A great book, but better when you can read the whole thing!!"
3,Charming,This caused me to step into mid 1800's. Rebecca Reuter Springer's near death experience was related in the vivid language of her day. I enjoyed going on this journey with her and found the ending to be realistic.
5,Must read for anyone how has lost a loved one,The glimpse of heaven this shares is very comforting to any of us who have lost a loved one. It gave me great comfort after the loss of my husband. It paints a beautiful picture of heaven.
3,Let down,All the feedback on this book was great but I found it to be slow and just a made up story. I have read many books on death and this one just didnt do it for me. My mom is terminally ill so any hope from books has helped me. This seemed to be a made up fairy tale book to me. For others they may find it inspiring. I guess Im looking for more facts.
3,Pages unevenly cut,"This was a gift for someone and, although the book's cover was in ideal condition,the inside looked like a child had hand cut the pages. they were all uneven. I guess that's why price was what it was. It would have been nice to be prewarned about the appearance of the pages."
2,My Dream of Heaven book,"In some places this book, My Dream of Heaven was good. But it is full of fallacy that animals are in heaven. If you read a bible you will find out that animals do not go to heaven, only humans who have accepted Jesus Christ as Saviour go to heaven. ALso young children who have reached accountabilty in their lives also do not go to heaven. This is when children know right from wrong and choose to do the wrong, then they are accountable for their souls. Overall, I was disappointed in the book due to the things that are not true in the book, The bible says that when an animals life is over, it is over but for humans this is not the case. If you would like a fictional account of heaven, I guess you would like this book but I needed something more and that is why I was disappointed."
1,YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!,"This must be a joke -- This book is nothing but imagination at best or pure spiritism and necromancy at worst. The Bible forbids this activity. It does not matter who endorsed it it violates all kinds of Scriptures. In the Old Testment a medium like Rebecca Springer would have brought the death penalty on herself. People want more than the Bible and go off into fantasy and imagination hoping to communicate with the dead. It is much safer to stay with the living biblical text. Why seek dreams, vision and the dead when you have the clear light of God's word. All I need to know about heaven is there -- I just need to get to know it. Neglect of Scripture leads one to this very dark pursuit."
5,A Wonderful vision!!,"This is the most glorious book. You can tell Oh No (an appropriate name) has never read this book, as all she had to say was to complain about Christians. What a shame she has such a closed mind. One cannot help but be uplifted to think of the wonderful place we will all go to someday at least those that believe and confess Jesus Christ as their savior. It is a vision of what happens when we get to heaven. It will comfort anyone who has had a loved one die, or for us who have wondered what heaven will be like. Glorious! Glorious!"
5,not this book,"The description and table of contents is NOT for this book, but for some writing text. I'd like to see a blurb about THIS book here."
3,Not horrible,"My boyfriend and I are trying to learn Gaelic together, so we picked up this course. The coursebook is constructed badly. There is no index or way to find anything without flipping thru the pages. The audio material isn't bad, but there are no pauses, which means that you are constantly hitting the pause button in order to practice your pronunciation...not a great idea if you are driving. All in all, not bad, but but hard to use unless you sit in front of your audio device with one finger on the pause button and are prepared to rewind/pause/read/flip back to pronunciation guide and buy a Gaidhlig/English dictionary somwhere else."
5,Dedication will pay off,"While the older version by Roderick MacKinnon may be better for all the fine points of grammar, this is the version you want for learning conversational Gaelic. The lessons build upon each other gradually, so you'll want to master each one before preceding. With dedication, you'll do just fine."
4,Nice book... but a bit of confusion..,"I bought the book a while ago from my University's bookstore thinking it would be a book to learn more about Irish Gaelic...boy was I wrong.This book teaches the SCOTTISH version of Gaelic, NOT the Irish version. It says it nowhere in the description. It's a very nice book despite it not being the language I wanted.I'd suggest you not buy this book though. There's a version out with tapes."
4,Gaelic Learning,"I have strong Irish decent from my mother's side of the family and we are going to visit(one of these years)Ireland and Scotland. So, I decided to learn how to speak Gaelic. I know two languages in addition to my native one, and this book is a big help. The language is so interesting. I can't wait to use it in it's native land! Great book."
1,Not for beginners!,"This book is definitely not for beginners. There's little in the way of explaining pronunciation, or anything else for that matter. I'd return it if I could. Better look elsewhere."
3,"good, but not enough","This set is a great introduction to Scots Gaelic, but the book really needs an English-Gaelic dictionary and phrase list to make it more useful for English speakers. The Gaelic Vocabulay at the end is good if one wishes to look up a Gaelic word to find its English meaning, but if one wants to quickly reference an English phrase with the Gaelic version, say, how to say ""Good Morning"" one cannot. (It's ""Madainn Math"", by the way) Because of this, I would recommend buying a separate English-Gaelic dictionary as an additional resource."
5,Poirot: The movie Collection-Set 4,I have a collection of Poitot movies and have always enjoyed them. I have just received set number6 and am looking forward to watching it very soon.
1,Mighty Jokes from little Acorn Grow,A travesty. Two movies for the here-to-fore price of 4. Can you spell RIP-OFF!
2,Disappointing,"I have every Suchet-Poirot and every Hickson-Marple. These, taken together, may be the best television mysteries ever made, but this most recent and (probably) final bit is way, way below the par of the series. Here's why:- Screenplay far below the standards. Just not a lot to it. The writer clearly thought that mysteries without any mystery was fun.- Settings and scenery and photography below the standards. Prior entries always provided a lot of beauty and atmosphere in the settings, which recreated the 1930-1950 era. These two fall flat.- Even David Suchet seems a bit wornout by doing the same old stuff in the same old way.- $35 bucks for just TWO movies? Who are you kidding? We English mystery fans are CHEAPOS! We want GREAT mysteries by the GROSS and we don't want to pay this much for them, even though we are likely to watch them over and over."
4,Suchet great;photography unappealing,"I agree-the price is way too high.Suchet is great,butthe photography is unappealing on older equipment.Fuzzy,[like the lens was dusty/foggy] and dark.I'm surprisedmore reviewers haven't mentioned this. I do miss Ms.Lemon,Inspector Japp (it's misleading to have them mentionedin the ""headlines""). I appreciate having the subtitles."
2,Overpriced though entertaining,Would you pay $20 to see a Poirot movie at the cinema? No. So $40 for only 2 movies is over-expensive.
3,Paradox Outpatient,"Paradox Outpatient was a breath of fresh air from my diet of 'mystery & suspense' novels. This story allowed me to sit in on the world of therapy sessions, of which I know little. It provided good insight on both sides of the equation. I also enjoyed Micheal's side trips into the street-level bar band scene. However I felt his extra-marital relation and subsequent outcome were predictable.I look forward to reading Mr. Schallehn's next effort."
3,Historical errors as early as page 3,"When an author doesn't bother to check easy facts I lose interest very quickly in their revisionist history. For example, beginning on page 3, ""that a jewish COTTON MILL manager was ACCUSED of murder and lynched"" is erroneous. History shows that in fact Leo Frank was the manager of his uncle's PENCIL FACTORY, not cotton mill, in Atlanta and was CONVICTED in the rape and murder of one of his factory workers, 13-year-old Mary Phagan. If both author and editor fail to do their fact-checking and their oversight results in early errors, why bother reading the rest of it. Next book, please!"
5,a great surprise,"I didnt think i would want to read an entire book about an incident that happened in atlanta years ago and was not even one of the great watershed moments of the civil rights era. but this work goes to show that even a so-called little story in the hands of a skiled writer can become a large story about america and how we live. It is a cliche found in too many reviews, but in this case it is true: Greene tells a story with the skills of a great novelist and without realizing it we are being told an awful lot of very important history and information here. This books says so much about america and particularly the relationship betweens blacks and jews that it is a truly remarkable and valuable piece of work. its the kind of book you wish you could write and would recommend to friends of all persuasions"
4,Looking Back At Atlanta,"I moved to Atlanta in 1988 and had little knowledge of ATalanta, other than traffic. This book gave me insight to a part of Atlanta I did not know. It also help to understand how Atlanta was formed in the early years and the prejudices that existed. The book was very well written and a joy to read. I would recommend this book to anyonme who wants to know the other side of Atlanta."
2,Painful to watch,"This film is cringeworthy for anyone who's been on the receiving end of a bully. Despite how very elementary those buttons are, this film succeeds in pushing them through Charlie's primary and secondary education, into young adulthood. The storyline leans toward redemption at times, though never really spills into it. In that light the pace flags a bit and feels like pertinent bits of the story have been left out. The acting was well done, it just felt like the story itself couldn't decide where it was going. By the time it meandered to the end I found I didn't really care how things turned out. Its messages on bullying, self-esteem and karma are clear, it just doesn't do a very good job of showing them."
3,"The truth is the Best policy, and the best teacher is Honesty","This is another good christian based movie about the truth. It might not have that air to it as drugs, alcohol and sex & violence are present throughout but learning what is right and wrong is what this movie is all about, thank Charlie I learned from you!"
2,Can't stand the Mick character.,"I started watching this movie with friends, but we never finished as I found the tension from the Mick character disturbing and decided to watch something else on this evening.Mick is a slimy bad school kid that reappears in Charlie's life years later in college. He is portrayed as a charmer with the girls, which I found insulting. I did however find the acting very good and I did like the Charlie character and will keep the movie around to perhaps watch on another day."
3,A movie in which nothing happends....,"This is a movie in which nothing of importance happends. It doesn't really have a real start and an a real end. It is boring and a bit weird.I guess the movie is about being a teenager and making life altering choices but it does not relay too well the gravity of such choices. Besides, the acting leaves a lot to be desired.Definetely a rental not a buy."
3,Is this really about Banks?,"I saw this movie pretty much because of ""The Social Network"". I thought it would be interesting to see Eisenberg in a pre-Social Network college film. I watched the audio commentary of Social Network and Fincher said he had seen Charlie Banks prior to making Social Network.I don't know much about Durst but found it funny that he was the director of this. He definitely has ambition and you can tell he put a lot of work into this. The acting is pretty good. I was happy to see John Ritter's son turning in good work. The movie starts out about Charlie but becomes more about the Ritter character. Kind of uneven, and there's not enough story. What's there is fine, but it just seems undeveloped, kind of like its young characters.So it's an affectionate thumbs down. With a better script, Durst might really surprise us one day.P.S. (spoiler) There is the threat of violence in a scene that made me cringe. It was really well done. Scorsese would nod his head in approval.2 out of 4"
3,"Simply put - ""nothing Special""","I received this DVD through Amazon's Vine program and have had it for a while before watching it. I'm not sure why I chose it but I do like - and review - ""independent"" cinema..Well, I set aside time to watch it and really didn't grab my attention. It's another ""coming of age"" film and I thought the direction was sloppy and acting just ""okay"". There are lots of other reviews of the film here so I won't waste your time with a long review. It was a long movie and just didn't stand out in any way.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
5,awesome movie!!!,this movie is amazing!!! the director did a great job!!! the story is one i think a lot of people can relate to and the actors did a great job of telling the story!!
2,"the characteristics of this movie - both good and bad are tough to discern, but one knows they are plentiful","It's unclear what this movie lacks, but one has a constant feeling that there is something missing. The storyline of a boy growing up and getting over his fear of the local bully seems almost too elaborate for this film. The actors are decent (Jason Ritter and Jesse Eisenberg) to mediocre (the female leads - Eva Amurri and Gloria Votsis), with no standout performances.It's impossible to say how much Fred Durst (yes, the lead singer of Limp Bizkit) is at fault for the final execution of the film and how much is the screenwriter's fault. Generally, it seems that the storyline, while being cohesive, manges to feel disjointed and some items alluded to throughout the movie wind up not being crucial at its end (perhaps that's the editor's mistake, less than the director's)."
3,"Good acting, good characters, but missing something...","I was impressed by the performances of the core cast, especially Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Ritter, but the dialogue/storyline, while interesting, could've been better. I think the writer was trying be a little too subtle exploring the issues of class, appearance, honor and redemption/forgiveness.While he's no Hitchcock, Fred Durst did a decent job as a first time director.I'd recommend this one as a rental, but not one to purchase for repeat viewings."
3,"I'm not a Fred Durst fan, but his directorial debut isn't too bad","There is not that much going on in The Education of Charlie Banks. The plot is lacking and I found myself looking for the point in it all, but the acting was pretty good and I wasn't bored to death. I didn't even know Fred Durst of the once popular band Limp Bizkit had gotten into the movie business. I don't know how much impact he had on this film, but it's not the complete pile of poo I expected from the guy who sang ""Nookie"" back when I was in high school."
3,Not bad not great,For first time director Durst I will say it's an impressive feat to be able to direct a movie and have it come across as professional. Durst for sure has a talent in this area and I will be curious to see future work. Not a fan of the band however.Story wise this is a pretty meat and potatoes coming of age flick. I'd say if you have a chance to netflix it go for it but not really worth a purchase.
4,"The ""Bully"" Pulpit","It wouldn't be fair to say this film was under-rated, since the reviews were, almost to a person, quite respectable. Yet, I doubt that this, for want of a better categorization, ""coming of age"" film by Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, was a major financial hit. Too bad, too. It features fine performances by a pretty interesting cast, including Jesse Eisenberg & Jason Ritter, and a really solid script by Peter Elkoff, that takes the cliches we have come to expect and, if it doesn't exactly turn them on their head, does something even better. It treats the potentially cliche characters as if they were actual HUMAN BEINGS, and when was the last time you saw a movie do that in this day and age. Look, if your idea of a meaningful movie involves talking cars from outer space, you're NOT going to like this. But if you are one of those (sadly, rapidly lessenig)people who think a movie with real people, giving real performances, in a real story, just MAY be worthwhile, I urge you to try this one."
2,I Tryed To Like It But Something Is Missing,"Who says girls can't be into metal, i have seen several of Byzantines shows and listen to metal everyday of my life. Also i really love bands like Arch Enemy, In Flames and Lamb Of God. I liked Byzantine's first album a lot better also, i can agree with the other reviewer, its missing all the technical tings that it use to have. Now they have taken more of a Death Metal route which i'm not really into. There are some really good guitar solo's but other than that its annoying screams al the way through. Being a girl i still love my metal and i tryed to like this but like i said some of it is to cloney and repeats itself a lot. I'll still go to there shows and support them though, they are really nice guys."
5,kick ass album,"The sophmore album kicks ass. It's hard and straight to the point. Byzantine kicks ass and they put on one of the best shows around. See them live if at all possible. O.J., Tony, Wolfe, and Skip will amaze you with stage presence and hard ass metal."
5,A must have Disc.,"If you don't own this, you are missing out. This band is a cross between Dream Theatre, Prong, Meshuggah and S.O.D. Hey..............Is that legal? Identity crisis and all, you must check this band out. Byzantine are catchy, tight, quick, and have tons of talent."
1,Intersting but there is a lot more to the story,"I strongly suggest that you read the book ""A Dark Place in the Jungle"" to get the result of Linda Spalding's research into the practices of Birute and the OFI. There are no clear black and white boundaries between right and wrong, only various shades of grey."
5,Reflections of Eden,"If you are inspired by dedicated peoplewith vision and or conservation this is a must read. Professor Galdikas is an amazing woman and is part of the Leakey sisterhood ie Fossey, Goodall and Galdikas, who have made life time studies of apes."
5,Dicken village scrooge collection,Really unique set and well painted. 3D inner scene is awesome. Looks great at Christmas time and have received many compliments.
4,Arrived broken,"Unfortunately I like the piece, but it arrived with the bottom broken. Returning it was painless, but with it had not been broken."
3,Beautiful but light bulb didn't work,"This was a beautiful product but unfortunately when it got to me, the little light bulb didn't work and as I have ordered the product from the States, I cannot get a replacement bulb here in Australia. This occured despite using a step down transformer to convert the voltage. Bit disappointed but it IS still a lovely thing."
2,not satisfied,opened the packaging and plugged in the heater. smell was aweful that came out of the heater.makes odd noise too when its on. i dont recommend this item.
2,Not as good as pictured,"it's not even a quality - which is good for the Halloween product, it's how it fits and looks. I would have returned it, but it was not allowed."
5,Deep but Clear,"I'm finding this to be very clear but not on a simple level. Subject matter is repeated from various angles so as to gradually build up more and more comprehensive logic and visualization of the theories and concepts. Author clarifies the differences between chaos and complexity, and shows how complexity exists in the physical and the social realms. I'm reading this book in conjunction with others, namely The Quantum Brain, by Jeffrey Santinover, and Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe, by Leon M. Lederman and Christopher T. Hill, and these books support and overlap each other."
1,Wince,"I originally picked up this book because I am interested in Complexity. It isn't about complexity, in spite of its title -- it's an instance of 'Critical Theory.' I'm not a big fan of ""Critical Theory,"" and this book won't make me one (it this is good critical theory, I'll have none of it, thanks).The discussion of ""Catastrophes,"" ""Chaos,"" and ""Complexity"" in the introduction was enough to make me wince: I don't know much about any of them, but enough to know that Taylor has it wrong -- or, if not wrong, is at least naive and superficial, so superficial that Taylor seems to know only that Complexity is 'hot,' and has piled some gibberish around it."
4,Another strong entry in the Dog Lovers' series.,"I truly am enjoying Susan Conant and her characters. Of course, Rowdy and Kimi steal the show each time, but I like Holly Winter too. This book focuses on the sport of Dog Conformation. Holly is at a National Convention for her breed - the Alaskan Malamute, so we don't see any other breed of dog in this book, but while she and her cousin Leah are there there is murder being done. Ms. Conant makes sure that her readers see how competitive and how political dog fanciers are, and we see Holly trying to use her not inconsiderable knowledge about dogs and dog training to help her nail down a killer. This is an excellent series, but for dog lovers, it is especially wonderful."
5,Murder + Malamutes + Mystery = Stud Rites,Nikki and Rowdy two playful malamutes are entered into a National Specialty Show. Holly Winter tries to figure out the murders and keep to the malamutes. This is a breath taking book!
4,An intriguing combination of dog breeding and murde,Stud RitesAuthor: Susan ConantPublisher: DoubledayCopyright 1996
2,Common knowledge ideas,"This is a good topic that I aroused my interest. However, the book doesn't follow through. Perhaps the topic is too broad to be covered well, but most of the ideas in this book are so obvious or out of reach, that I didn't find much use in it. For example, Caroselli suggests that you 'coin a memorable phrase.' Well if I could do that, I would be writing jingles for an ad agency. Other ideas like 'get a part time job', 'present a proposal to your boss' and 'develop your personal power' don't offer any insight, don't provide nuggets of opportunity. They just take up a few pages."
5,Great Resource,A terrific collection of practical ideas and valuable tips for advancing your career in today's competitive job market.
4,Focused View,"What I found useful was the focus which examined three fundamental reasons which motivate self-promotion - a bigger paycheck, greater prestige, and more power. The author provides clear insight and suggests practical ways to go beyond the job in order to achieve these three."
2,Obvious solutions with little insight,"Overall, this is a nice book and a good topic. However, this book focuses on topics and ideas so obvious, I found myself muttering things like ""No kidding"" as I read it. Topics like 'Coin a memorable phrase' or 'Seize the day' or 'Develop your persuasion power' aren't new and don't uncover any new territory. If you can get this in used condition it might be worth the cost. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."
4,Made me miss him all over again!,"This is a very honest, real-life appraisal of a man dearly loved by the people that knew him best. It does not just concentrate on Woody, the coach, it also shows you his concern for his players, Ohio State and the state of Ohio."
4,Good product,"I use this pen mostly in a professional capacity (writing clinical notes, signing documents, etc). My penmanship has always been best with a fountain pen. The Cross Century II has the weight to slide right into the perfect writing position in my hand but is not so heavy that my hand tires. Its sleek design makes it fit nicely into the pen pocket of my lab coat. The royal blue color is awesome! The only drawback for me personally is that the medium nib on my pen is narrower than that of other medium-nibbed pens I own, and it doesn't glide as smoothly as some of my other (larger) medium-nipped pens. Overall a good product and highly recommended.Cross Century II Royal Blue w/ stainless steel nib Medium Point Fountain Pen - 419-24MS"
3,Cross Fountain pen,"The Cross fountain pen is a nice pen nicely finished and stylish. The only thing about it is the small ink refills that it takes and the short amount of time that you can write with it before it runs out of ink. I like it, but I don't like the small amount of ink they give you for the refills. So if you are buying the pen to write in a journal, or diary etc. you might want to think about buying a fountain pen that actually holds enough ink to do the job. My next purchase would be a Parker fountain pen, they are nice and stylish, and have longer refill cartridges which holds more ink."
3,Good enough,"As a pen fountain collector, never have being a Cross fan. This pen is good enough but rough as all Cross fountain pen. The color is nice."
3,Elegant but misleading,"It is elegant & well balanced nice writing instrument. But I expected a real fountain pen not a one with refill. Bit disappointed, must buy the converter from local agent."
3,Songs of the Wild West,"This book is a great book for the whole family to enjoy singingwestern songs together, or individually. It has the music and lyricsso that you can play and sing! We love to sit at the piano and sing these great westerns. Some of our favorites were Blood on The Saddle, The Strawberry Roan, Down in the Valley, Sweet Betsy From Pike, and many other great songs!"
5,Insights into the life of Hoffer,"I first read The True Believer over a year ago. No other book has made more of an impression on me. The insights into human nature it contains never cease to amaze me. I refer to it often and I never fail to be amazed at how current events prove Hoffers assertion correct over and over.I was rather surprised when I read this autobiography of hoffer. I was surprised at how small the book was and slightly surprised at how little he discussed writing The True Believer. The book describes Hoffers life as a transient and the many characters he met and worked with during this time. There are enough entertaining stories in the book to keep any reader engaged, even if youve never read any of Hoffers books.Reading the book really gives you an idea of just how intelligent Hoffer was. Hoffer was knowledgable on a wide range of subjects, from Chemistry and Philosphy to advanced Mathmatics and all sorts of sciences."
4,Mom's present,"My mother liked it a lot. The only criticism she had is that for such a small bottle, she thought it would be more highly concentrated. It takes more than she thought to make her bath the way she likes it."
1,Sucked,The I ordered the gloves a size bigger than what I normally wear and they still didn't fit quite right. The placement of the hard knuckles was also way off. It was awkward and uncomfortable. They sit maybe half and inch ahead of my knuckles. I regret buying these gloves.
1,Shipping and handling ridiculous,After spending way too much on shipping the company waited an entire week before even sending this item off. With the number of comparable products out there I would just skip buying anything from this company.
1,"As much as Hatch hits it out of the ballpark, on this one they missed completely","I have a good selection of Hatch gloves and they are usually amazing. Unfortunately, they missed the mark on these. I am a Large size in every other Hatch glove but this one feels like I would have to order a XXL! I also find the palm padding quite overkill. I shoot high powered firearms, and the palm felt really strange to grab the grip. Now, it may have been also because they were too small for me, but I was unimpressed. I would normally return them for a bigger size, but as I work with a large number of people, I have decided to give them to someone who they fit better than me. The stitching does leave some to be desired but it does have some of the best gripping surfaces of any other glove I have ever tried. Don't give up on Safariland's Hatch series! They usually make great stuff! This just doesn't happen to be one."
2,instance of you get what you pay for,"Which in the case of these gloves is not a whole lot . Stitching is rough shod and glue is actually visible at some points. The grip material on the palm , pad of your hand and trigger/middle fingers is probably the only upside. The sizing is way off as mentioned in another review and the palm pad is a piece of cheap foam rubber sewn under the grip material that is well served by getting cut out ."
2,Not good,"I'm a clean XL in most gloves, and these are very badly put together, and fit my hand really weird. The stitching is sloppy and causes the glove to sit on the hand in a very weird way, making the glove FAR too tight in most areas. Also, the knuckle guard is warped slightly concave, and stitched on too tight, so the entire middle of the hand is jammed into the knuckle plate, as opposed to sitting under it while the hand is resting. Bending the fingers is very difficult and can't be maintained for long.Not a functional glove for anything."
1,Truly the Worst Gloves I Have Purchased,"I picked these gloves up as 3 season motorcycle gloves. I ordered the XL as that is the size I wear in every other set of gloves. They arrived and they didn't fit. I could squeeze my hand into the gloves but could not close my hand. So, I ordered a set of the XXL...the good news is I can now close my hand, the bad news is when I close my hand it pinches my pinky hard enough to hurt. I wore the gloves while practicing Kali to try to stretch them out and get them comfortable...nothing.Maybe it's just me but I highly recommend trying these gloves on before purchasing them and if you do order them purchase a size larger than you normally wear."
3,A rewarding listen...,"Soul Embraced sound invigorated on this release. They plow thru their above-average death metal/power metal material, driven by great drum work and tight arrangments. The emphasis on melody is a nice change from the typical atonal sludge of so many bands. Vocals are very hard-core in style. Good stuff by these members of Living Sacrifice. Worth checking out."
5,GUITAR SOLO!,"How can this be over-rated?!?!?! This CD has some of the best guitar solo's Rocky Gray ever put out! On track number 4(I forget the name cuz i don't have the CD with me) has the best guitar solo on the cd! The vocals are very unique and I was not expecting them to be the way they are. The vocals are mostly high and breathy, but change to a lower growl often(like on The Scorn OF Deaths Kiss). So just because it is unique does NOT mean it is a bad CD. it may take some getting used to, but give it a chance and i am sure it will grow on you!"
2,OH soo much more potential,"This cd is overrated! Im sorry but i think that it is. I love heavy music,but i was totally expecting better especially with the guitar and drummer from LIVING SACRIFICE! Granted the cd has a few songs like number 4,9, and 11 but over all i think thats it. The vocals are decent. They did mix the cd rather well though."
4,DARK MAN IS AN ADDICTIVE RAP DEMON!!,"DMX has an excellent voice and rap style, but he should add more people onto his album. He should also lighten up on the lyrics, stop rapping about killing and the devil so much. Anyway, I love GET AT ME DOG, X is COMING, RUFF RYDERS, DAMIEN, FOR MY DOGS, and Nig.. DONE START'N SOMETHING. His songs really depict street life THROUGH HIS EYES. Only one or two songs are questionable. Great teaming up with Bad Boy's Lox and MASE. Ruff Ryders! Buy this, all you rap fans!!!!!! I can't wait to get the second one."
1,THIS S*** IS WACK,"PEOPLE DON'T GET ME WRONG I THINK DMX IS ONE OF THE TOP DOGS OUT THERE BUT THE ALBUM SOUNDS LIKE SOME 1989 S***, FOR ALL THE FANS THAT DON'T AGREE WITH ME THATS ALL GOOD BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO ""CRIME STORY"" HE SUMS UP HIS ALBUM WHEN HE SAYS,... ""WHAT A WASTE OF POTENTICAL"" INDEED IT WAS ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE THE NEXT ONE CAN BE BETTER"
1,Punk,"This album is weak, I wouldn't peep it unless your into some serious wack rhymes and beats... Call me a hater if you want but thats how I feel. Does got 2 good cuts on it though..."
1,Not very good.,"I do not like this album, though DMX does have some charisma. But let's face it: he has no flow. Never has, and probably never will. Plus on that one song ""West Coast"", which is unreleased, he disses 2Pac after his death. That's just plain cowardly. 2Pac was one of the greatest rappers of all-time, DMX is no 2Pac. ""How's It Going Down"" is the only good song. ""Get At Me Dog"" is also decent but not great. Plus he disses 2Pac on that song too. What a punk, that's why I give DMX one star. And I don't like ""Damien"" at all, don't get what you others seem to like so much about it."
5,DMX IS OFF THE HOOK!!!,"This is his phatest album out of the 2 so far.It's got me memorizin the songs.I've only had the cd for 3 weeks.I'ts got tight bass,and phat lyrics.I'd give it 10 stars if could,but i'll give it 5.Keep it real D.Peace out."
3,I wasn't feelin this album,"DMX is definately my favorite artist on the East Coast. He could have done a better job on his first album. I thought he didn't show his full potential. After hearing the Intro and the Ruff Ryders Anthem I thought the whole album was going to be tight, but he just has too many mediocre songs and poor production. And I end up skipping a lot of songs to get to that good song like Damien or Stop Being Greedy. The reason I didn't get his second album was because I heard it wasn't good as his first and I'm not going to buy anything worse than this."
5,i think dmx is the man his the best by far,dmx is the best thang since fried chicken the man got it going on im in the military and i think dmx has help me threw bosnia and kuwait he kept it real with the streets and thats what im talking about big ups to the brother doing his thang
5,DMX IS THE BOMB,"THERE ARENT TO MANY WORDS TO DESCRIBE DMX. HE IS SO BRILLENT AND HIS MUSIC IS GREAT. I LIKE HIS STYLE OF RAP BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF DIFFERENT.WHILE EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO COPY EVERYBODY ELSES MUSIC DMX HIT DOWN WITH HIS OWN THUG APPROACH. HE GIVES NOTICE TO GOD WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE HE IS NOT ASHAMED TO BREAK IT DOWN AND STOP THE MUSIC AND PRAY, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HARD CORE RAPPERS DONT DO. I LOVE DMX."
1,IT'S DARK AND DMX IS WACK,"The people who are giving this album props are: 1. Not listening to the songs; 2. Stupider than DMX. The beats are terrible and the lyrics are nothing more than screaming and barking, they make no kind of sense. He got one star because zero stars isn't available."
2,THIS ALBUM IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE!!,"Much like his Money, Cash Hoes partner, Jay-Z, DMX is asubstanceless pop-rapper who survives on the fact that he is a Tupacclone. Once his angry black man novelty wears off, people will see that his music is quaint dribble at best. Like one of my good friends said, he is a decent rapper who just doesn't rap about anything worthwhile. I am sure that he has more on his mind than being angry and killing people.DMX's career will be buried along the rest of dominant rappers' of the late 90's in the end. He is surviving on the present hardcore wave that fuels the adreline of young white kids, but little else. My brother wants this album, but I love him too much for him to think that DMX is an artist worth remembering. His hip-hop sensitivity is already warped by Jay-Z and Redman, I don't want to escalate the damage."
1,don't waste ya $,"some of the beats was o k , but his lyrics are pretty sad. and to make matters worse he has mase and the lox on the c d some of the most commercial mc's you can get."
1,"I just love Dmx and his album ""Its dark and hell is hot""",i love his songs. I am difinetly going to Hard Knock life Tour. Almost everyday i lsten to his album on some time internet or on my stereo.
5,DMX ur my dogg for life,"Aiight,this is the stuff that rap-lovers are looking for.I got this CD cuz i heard DMX on the LOX song ""Money,Power,and Respect"" and since then,he's been tha best rapper out there.YONKERS 4-LIFE Get at me Dogg!!!!!!!!!"
4,DMX is Hot,Man When I first heard samples from this Album I knew this was gangsta. DMX has had a great career. The Best Song Has to be Niggaz done Started somethin I think Mase's Flow is Hot. Make another album please DMX
4,GREAT,This album hit the mark of DMX... But its not good as flesh of my flesh i dont know its my opinion though. over all awesome cd. the last track is just to nice
4,great,"I got this while back ,sometime last year.I got the great depression too,but its easy to compare.This will probably be stated as his best lp out of the 5 including grand champ.Its very dark dmx style,but since this x has changed.The best songs are the ruff ryders anthem,i can feel it,get at me dog,let me fly.U gotta get this one out of all the x albums."
5,"Judge not, unless you've been judged first!","This will forever be the studded crown in the midst of all the Dark Man's achievements. By far the most complete and hard hitting release of his today. Flesh of my flesh... was a truly well done LP. But if you were there for this one you know this is where rap is at. 'Look thru my eyes' and 'Let me fly' Dark Man, forever"
5,INCREDIBLE CD!!,"I bought this cd about three days ago, wondering what it was going to be like. I listened to the first two songs and I was blown away. They were incredible, with Ruff Ryder's Anthem being one of my favorite songs of all time. The cd pretty much continues the same way for the rest of the album. Banger after Banger after Banger after Banger. Every song is incredible. I love all of them. GREAT ALBUM! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! BUY IT!"
5,really tight album,"This is a really good debut by x but I still perfer flesh of my flesh.The ruff ryders anthem has a really catchy beat and is one of the best on the album.I think that damien is the best, the beat is superb and the lyrics are very well worked, stop being greedy has a really catchy beat to, let me fly and look thru my eyes are both hot to and ate is such a track.get this album and flesh of my flesh"
2,alright album,"DMX's album is very overrated and is boring after about 2 weeks. I suggest you pick up anything by 2Pac (Greatest Hits, Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me are 1000000 x better than DMX).....I'm not saying it's an awful CD--- it's just not that good."
5,DMX got skills!,"This CD is TIGHT!! If you like hip hop, this is the album for you. Each song has its own catchy beat/ lyrics, and you won't stop listening to it for a VERY long time (I've had it for about 2 years, and I still hear it almost every day). A must have."
5,DMX this cd kicks @$$,"I love this cd. If u cant handel it dont listen to it. Honestly, i cant stop listening to it. The lyrics are phat, even though some are scary they are great. I love the phat beats that u catch yourself bouncin' to. DMX u have much respect and much love from me."
2,I am bored......,"ILL beats. DECENT rhymes. DMX doesn't really have much to say. how many times can a person say where my dogs at?IN all this album is ILL if you like partying, but it showed not a bit of insight.For those of you who like to listen to versitile rap, DMX is NOT your man. ON this album he talks about the same thing every other rapper does, weed, sex, killing(of course he has a couple of tracks where he tries to come off like a decent man).BEWARE! When you first hear the album you will be enticed by the ILL beats-this is what happened to me. I copped the album from a friend, took it home, played it and then realized that the brother had no REAL lyrical skills-it was strickly beats. I give DMX props in that area because without the beats, he's pretty much outdone by REAL rhymers such as CANIBUS, RAKIM, NAS, etc.peacemic-12"
5,The CD is slammin',"I got the CD today and I haven't stopped listening to it. I dont even buy CD's. But after hearing ""GET AT ME DOG,"" ""STOP BEING GREEDY,"" and ""RUFF RYDER'S ANTHEM,"" I had to get his album. He's the best and ""if you don't know by now then you slipping."" He got his own unique style. All the songs on the album is phat. All hot enough to become singles. Trust me, the CD is slammin. Beats, lyrics, and everything else. You don't even have to know the lyrics, because the beat alone will have you so hyped, you'll forget about lyrics. Three record stores I went to, it was sold out. It took me forever to get this. Now I aint letting it out of my sight. Dark Man aint rappin' about brand name clothes, rolex, and all that mess like all them other rappers. He's just straight lettin you know what street n?**$% feel, cuz ya n?**$% want the real. Keep it up DMX, I LOVE YOU, that's my men and them."
3,It's Aight,"This album is o. k. it ain't all that. D.M.X. does have a grrr-eat new style and the beats are hypnotic but his lyrics are very lackluster. If he wants to live up to the ""The Second Coming Of Tupac"" label that everyone is tagging him with, he's going to have to work on his lyricism. But on a lighter note he is a good new talent that's bringing real rap back."
4,Hell is Hot and So is DMX,"DMX attacks the mic like the savage pit bull that he is. His brutal flow more than compensates for the sometimes weak or inappropriate beats. The wicked lyrics combine with head bobbin beats to create a CD that is not only a true hard core rap listening experience, but a neo psychedelic brain attack. This disc is hot, but the DarkMan is hotter."
4,Awesome,"This is the best album that DMX has done. Sad, that it is his first album, but it is definitley a classic one. From the intro to Niggaz Done Started Something, X will keep your ears at attention and hungry for more. He almost forces you to put it on repeat. ""Ruff Ryders Anthem"" - Need I say more. Don't lie, when this came out you couldn't help but sing everytime you heard or somebody rap it in class or at work. Though the chorus is addicting, don't overlook the context of the song, let alone the ablum. ""Get at Me Dog"" is the track letting everyone know he is not to be messed with. He even goes back to diss K-Solo (who he battled while locked up). The album itself is a story. Like a day in the life of DMX. At sunrise it's the anthem to get em hyped up, and at night he prays before bed....but Niggaz Done Started Something."

2,I don't get it,"Someone said he was like 2PAC, ummmmm no. I see very little creativity or lyrical talent to DMX. Somewhat catchy beats and a neat voice. Give me Outkast, Public Enemy, Black Star, or GZA/Genius over this any day!"
1,"Dmx, LiL zane, Nelly, MasterP, ARE GARBAGE!","Hi since this is a review for a dmx alblum, i'd prefer stick to the subject and let you know that DMX is garbage, dosent make any sense, cannot flow, isent original, tries to copy the great 2pac, and is very repititious.. Buy this alblum if you dont know real rap music such as 2pac, Common, mos def, De La, etc.Note: this review was written in simple fashion to help the reading impared ;)"
1,DMX IS CRUEL TO ANIMALS,Don't give your hard earned cash to this creep. DMX has been busted twice for animal cruelty. He's a weazel.
1,The poor man is suffering.,He's oppressed! Our president oppresses him. So oppressed he abuses defenseless animals.If you must listen download for free. Don't make this guy an even richer role model.
5,DMX is the Best,"As you know him as DMX or Dark Man X,he is one of the greatest there is but he is doing great and anyone who doesn't like him keep it to yourself,cause when the dogs of the leach he is going to bite.I really love his music and is a huge fanso at least he keeps it real.(I love you DMX)One Love Boomer."
3,He's good,"I think dat he's good but he referes to voilence way too much, it's unnecessary. I like the music, though. I am going to get this CD"
4,DMX is definetly hot.,DMX is definetly hot. He is the best new rapper out there. If you are any kind of a rap fan you have to get this CD.
5,wow,"Back in '98 when I listened to mostly house and dance music, I heard about this new rapper called DMX. I bought his album and to this day I am still astonished on how amazing his first album was. I still have it in my car's cd player and I listen to it everytime i drive to school or work. It's dark and hell is hot is the reason I like rap music. His other albums were solid too but not nearly as good. Listen to his second verse on ""X is coming"" and his verse on ""Niggaz done started something"" YO's finest."
5,X is King,X takes it to the streets like no other rapper in this album. I would have to say this is my favorite rap album.
5,DMX's best album,"Hey All! This is by far DMX's best album. It has everything you can ask for when it comes to rap. He's humble and gritty, and everything in between which makes this a classic album. If you don't like this album you don't like rap (period). You like what white people have taken, and that's nasty rappers who can't rap, rhyme, or even talk. If you want to listen to some quality music pick up a copy. You won't regret it!"
5,DMX is the hottest rapper right now & his CD is a must have!,DMX is the hottest rapper out right now and his CD is a must have. DMX laced every track and it doesn't stop bumpin. His skills are surprising and definitely deserve respect. DMX is tha $hit!!
