5,The best opera recording of all time,"After years of listening to operas sung by the legends of opera, I have concluded that this Don Giovanni is the finest opera recording of a towering masterpiece ever made. The superstar Sutherland is mesmerizing in tonal beauty, her voice is just too gorgeous to believe. And what technique! The rest of the cast almost matches her unreachable status. And if you know Sutherland's voice, you'll know that if a singer is talented enough to match her vocally, he or she must be fantastic. This is desert island material, definitely."
5,fabulous,"When I heard the angelic voice of Sutherland singing Donna Anna in my music 111 class, I was hooked. I've never heard a more beautiful voice in my life. Move over, Bartoli.Then I notice all the other singers here are all great. Though not in the caliber of Dame Joan. But then, of course, Sutherland's voice is divine. She is the queen.Her perfect singing here as Donna Anna is enough to buy this cd. May I also suggest her ""Daughter of the Regiment""."
5,"Like Solti's ""Ring,"" this is the ""Don G."" to beat","A superb recording of Mozart's great ""Don Giovanni"" which shows no signs of aging. First-class through and through."
5,Great for toddlers!,My 14-month-old loves this book. It's easy to hold and loaded with great photos. I think reading these books to her has helped her learn many new words in the past two months. Wonderful!
5,the stewards bible!!!!!,"when to argue, what to say, what laws to use and how to use them!this book will make you into a super steward!!! The managementwill not try any of their shinanigans after you use this book!!One steward of understanding can cause a hundred management ofstrength to tremble!!!! This book will give you that understanding!!!remember SOLIDARITY FOREVER!!!!!!!"
5,"If you are a Union Steward, you must read this book.","All Union Stewards and Union Members should read this book. It explains your legal rights in the workplace in a very simple manner. If you are an active Union Leader, you will read this book over and over again. When I was a new Steward I was fortunate enough to come across a copy of this book. After reading it I was very pleased, whereas the boss was not pleased at all. I have won many grievances due to the knowledge this book has given me. This book is a must read for the Union Steward."
5,One of My Favorite All Time Albums,"I loved this album when EMI pressed it on 33 1/3 RPM vinyl and I also love the CD. Musically and sonically it is superb. Robert Fine, a superior recording engineer, was Scharzkopf's husband, much to Callas' chagrin. I must have played these pieces many thousands of times and I still love them, especially when sung by Scharzkopf."
4,Wonderful book,"This is a wonderful book, but I'm a little wary of giving it too good a review. The projects all look great, but I found a mistake in the first project that I tried. If you work the Turkoman rug exactly as the chart, it will not turn out the same as the picture. The border, in fact, will not even be symmetrical (as the picture is). As an experienced crafter, I picked up on this and was able to correct it, but I was disappointed to find the error in the first place. I look forward to trying other projects and hope they are error-free."
4,Lovely Book,"The book is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS and actually makes a wonderful coffee table book. The patterns are fairly straightforward and useful. My only critique is that, for crafters, the organization is confusing. It's not easy to connect the pictures to the patterns - I find that I have to go through the index. The effect, however, is that the book is even more gorgeous."
3,nice barrette,"This is a beautiful, well crafted barrette. I bought it because I needed a barrette that could hold a very large amount of hair for a particular bun my daughter needed to do for ballet. She had too much hair for the barrrette and it could not do what we needed. It would be good for other uses."
5,Audio version (unabridged) is a 5-star production,"My favorite genre is erotic romance, so I hesitated to buy this audio book. And Sarah Mayberry was a complete unknown for me.I really loved this story and this new author. It was full of witty dialog; it was sweet, funny, sexy, heart-wrenching, and a great story. The narrator, Elizabeth Livingston, was the best female reader I've listened to in a very long time. I'll be buying many more of the Blaze stories written by Mayberry."
2,Decent enough... but SPOILERS,"Does just about every romance have to judge the heroine on whether or not she wants kids? Really? Can we have a book in which the heroine doesn't want children and not have it be some sort of MORAL test or a crippling fear. (""Poor girl, she doesn't know what she wants. We must show her what a True Woman is - a mother!"")How about a heroine who knows what she wants and other characters who don't PRESSURE her into something else?"
1,"Almost 100 Years Old, and Uses the JEPD Theory","Although it is free, this book is not be worth your time to download and read it -- especially if you are interested in reading authors who take a conservative view of the Scriptures.In this book, John Edgar McFadyen subscribes to the JEPD Theory, and is quite comfortable explaining away the traditional authorship of most Old Testament books. He wrote from a perspective that was limited to the lens of ""modern science"" at that time (early 1900's). I feel this book has historic value -- to show what people were thinking a hundred years ago about the Bible. But this book has no particular value today for people who want to understand the message of the Old Testament.This is not the place for me to argue for a conservative approach to the Old Testament, but it is just a word for those who are not familiar with the author of this (Free!) book. Personally, I won't keep it in my Kindle library."
3,Interesting,A little bit disappointed in it Found it very hard to to concentrate on A simple version would be better
1,Not what I was looking for,"I didn't care too much for this book because it is written from the view of literature, and I was looking for books with the actual study of scripture as truth."
1,Steel Review,This is the film that killed the comic book movie. Shaq's acting is wooden at best. The dialogue is soo bad it makes the dialogue from DIC's Battletoads pliot sound good. The story arc is luke-warm and has many mindless filler. Infact it takes 37 minutes or more to get to see Shaq wear the Steel suit. The villians are morons. The action is basic. The ONLY cool factor of this is the laser-shooting wheelchair but it fails to help the film in the long run. I give this film a 1 out of 10.
4,Entertaining movie!,Movie was entertaining. Was funny to see Shaq in the role! Not oscar material but entertaining. I would recommend it if you're bored.
5,Super Scoop,Was Glad That This Item Ended Up On DVD. Wish more Super Hero VHS Movies End Up On DVD. Wish Wonder Woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) Would Go To DVD.
5,NOt to be Forgotten,"There are exzcellent Star Trek titles and some perhaps less so, and this is among the best. Forstchen brings the excitement he generates in his Lost Regiment series to Start Trek with a vengeance. Highly readable and well written."
1,Read the Lost Regiment instead of this,"I think I want my money back. The only reason I bought this book was because it was written by Forstchen, whose Lost Regiment books are superb. However, like ALL the Star Trek books I have read, it was a great disappointment. And I am a Star Trek fan, having seen every episode of the original series several times.The only thing that I can think of that would explain this piece of tripe put out by a great writer of military SciFi is that he needed the money. Otherwise, the writing, character development, and everything else is hack writing at its worst (or best, its competently done genre fiction, just not worth buying brand new--look for it in a used-bookstore or your local library).If you want to read a really good story by the same author, look for any of his Lost Regiment series."
3,"Not His Finest, But Still A Good Read","This book is very Dostoyevsky in some ways, yet is still a departure from his usual fare. It is properly dark and depressing in keeping with his usual style. It is a personel account of his time in a horrific Russian prison. He builds his characters well and evokes feelings in the reader, but this book will never stand up to his immortal Crime and Punishment."
3,A House of Stories,"When initially investigating 'The House of the Dead'...I was interested to see what Dostoyevsky would do for a treatment of prison life in Russia at his time.While the stories he reveals are interesting, I found a lack of a real 'storyline thread' to call this a novel, and saw it more as a collection of 'short stories'....The day to day interactions of the prisoners, as well as the separation of what can be defined as 'noble' men and 'blue collar' men and how they segregate into cliques is interesting, but still not as good a read as other of his works.An easy foray into Dostoyevsky, this still is not a good example of his writing and storytelling skills."
3,"A good, but flawed work.","I've read all of Dostoyevsky's books, and I like six of his works better than this one. That isn't to say that this is a bad work, it simply shows how talented of a writer he is.This book is a semi-autobiographical piece about the time Dostoyevesky spent in a Siberian prison. Here he relates to the dehumanizing, deadening effects of the modern prison system and invokes his philosophies of better ways of treating and rehabilitating prisoners. He sketches detailed characters, and builds largely on the dichotomy between the ""common crook"" and the ""gentleman lawbreaker,"" the latter which is represented by him, and also the minority in the prison.All in all, quite a good piece."
3,Good book,"Book with examples step-by-step of applications created in FLEX 1.0. It for installation configurations and other Flex's basic subjects. It is a book for intermediary and advanced users.To seize well the book is necessary knowledge deepened of ActionScript. A good references is the book Object-Oriented Programming with ActionScript 2.0.In spite of being version 2 of Flex liberate it continues to be a good references, but you will have to know exactly what changed of the version 1 to 2."
4,"Fun, campy and worth reading","I normally shy away from movie novelizations, because they seem to lack the depth of books that precede the movies they spawn. I bought this for my classroom library, thinking that it might lure some reluctant young readers, but I found myself really enjoying it. The author has a great sense of campy humor, isn't afraid to deviate from an exact replication of the movie's plot and I thought the ending was better than the one in the movie. It was a fun read."
3,Very good,I thought this book was very good. I actually liked it more than the movie. The only thing was that this book's dialog and stuff was often very different from the movie. Overall I really liked the book though.
4,Sometimes cult heroes take time to mature.,"The recent discovery of Buffy the vampire slayer on television has led me to pursure the character to greater depths. The search has produced a wonderful result.Written in 1992, after the movie, the author hasgiven the reader a delightful read and a character of charming presence. Heroes and heroines are hard to come by and one which can be identified with is truly a find. As a librarian, I can safely say that the original book is a must readfor any young reader (or fan) who might have missed it the first time around.After reading Buffy the vampire slayer I felt as long as Buffy, the Shadow, and Robin survive --evil shall not prevail."
3,Elfish Echo - Strong Medicine,"Even though Elfish Echo's STRONG MEDICINE has they rhythmic trappings of drum'n'bass, its abstract flavor gives it more of an edge, like the melodic stabs of ""Amy & Jordan"" or the Tim Hecker-esque guitar refraction of ""Friendly Robbery."" But you can also hear little bits of cheekiness too, like the lounge intro that kicks off ""Bitten,"" before it dives into jazzed-up chaos. There's still plenty of roughness, as on the clattering drums of ""I/O,"" the deepness of ""Molybdän,"" or the galloping bass (and then jazzy piano chords) of ""Slick,"" but there's also plenty of mellowness too: the spacious ""Windkanal,"" the sparseness that permeates of ""Strictly Insular."" ""Murasaki"" follows that emptiness with some lighter breaks that slowly fill in sonically. ""Yumi's Theme"" loses the drum'n'bass altogether for some space jazz, and ""Tsuge"" closes the album with the rhythms, but once again abstract. Forward thinking beats here."
1,"Callas, why are you ruining Bellini?","Bellini is beautiful. Why are you ruining his bel canto beauty by shouting and screaming and ignoring the lovely lines and coloratura.This is supposed to be your best role? I'll rather listen to Ethel Merman. Norma is bel canto, not belt canto."
2,"Forget Callas, go for the deutekom/troyanos","This is good, but not great. The deutekom/troyanos is the best there is."
2,you all are missing the point,"This Norma is not as good as the Caballe/Vickers, Sutherland/Horne, and Deutekom/Troyanos, and even the Sutherland/Caballe one.Simply, Callas does not have the voice to sing Norma, Period!This is all hype. None of you ever heard Callas live. These recordings are made to make her sound as good as possible. I've heard her and she is extremely inconsistant. In one Lucia, she cracked on three high notes.What we have here are a few samples in which Callas got lucky and sang relatively decent performance. While in life, she is good about once in ten, at least.But her stage presence, and the lack of super talents in her period made her memory great.She is ordinary stuff. And that is the truth.Try giving some of today's artists like Renee Fleming, a voice recorded to sound as she really sounds on stage. Not fabricated to cover Callas's hugh scratchy sound and pitched high notes."
4,Cats love it,"The cats love to play with this frog, as long as they are not overexposed to it. I try to give them limited/supervised play time with catnip toys because I don't want them developing a tolerance to them, but sometimes I forget. And when I pick this forgotten frog up off the floor, it is completely sodden with cat saliva. Gross, I know, but it is a sure sign that the cats are enjoying it immensely. It also makes a pleasant crinkling sound when the cats are chomping on it. As far as catnip toys go, they preferDr. Noys Cat Squirrel, but this frog is a good backup."
3,Faucet Buttons,They are I guess Okay. Wouldn't work on my Faucet Not big enough Buttons. Would've worked If they were big enough though.
5,"Fits well, low cost, fast delivery.","My 2003 Chrysler van had a broken mirror on the driver side. The dealer price for the mirror was out of the question. I found this mirror and ordered it. It arrived a day earlier than the tracking. It matched my broken mirror exactly. It came with 2 double stick pads to adhere it to the mirror glass or housing. I added 4 dabs of 100% silicone to the mirror also, along with a small bead along the top of the mirror (to preven water from damaging pads in coming years). I then wiped the excess silicone from the top of the mirror to seal any gaps. Fast delivery, good fit to old mirror, easy mounting = well worth the low cost. My wife almost got into an accident due to the fracture line in the old mirror, so I need to replace it ASAP. This proved to be a low cost easy fix."
3,Sideview Mirror,"This product was a convenient, easy-to-install, inexpensive option to replace the sideview mirror on a Chrysler town & country. It does not have the heated feature. Delivery was fast."
1,An improbable and boring tale of man rape.,"I hated this book. I don't consider it a yaoi title, it's more like a suspense thriller that just happens to have a few pages of man rape thrown in. It's about a psychopath wrestler who molests a younger wrestler. It's boring, makes you uneasy and the twist at the end is just plain stupid. The characters are really 2 dimensional and you are never able to sympathise with the hero. The rape/sex scenes don't last more than a page and everything is covered up. Don't waste your money on this awful book, go buy ""Brother"" by Yuzuha Ougi instead."
3,I should have researched this a little more before buying,"As the owner of a newly adopted shelter dog, I love the idea of the 'Talk to Me' treat ball. I guess I should have done a little more reading up on it before buying, though. You are supposed to be able to record a personalized message to your dog, however, my attempt to record failed and I'm guessing it's because the battery is bad. I would replace the battery, but I haven't been able to remove the compartment that holds the recorder or battery again. It's probably for the best, anyway, as I read on the package that it's not recommended for dogs over 30 pounds. I can see why...my 95 pound dog tried to play with it and smacked it hard against the wall. With his strength and size, that hard, heavy plastic ball could be dangerous to anyone around."
1,talk to me treat ball,Total junk!!! Recorder didnt work from the start. Lucky it held the treat. Not even worth returning. Went in the garbage after it came out of package. Don't waste your money on this one!!
3,Didn't keep it,"I ordered this bracelet because in the picture it looked mostly purple. Well, the stones definitely had a purple AND green hue to them. I do not wear green or particularly like that color, so I sent the bracelet back. This doesn't mean that there was anything wrong with the bracelet, just a matter of personal preference. The stones were a pretty decent size and the bracelet looked OK."
3,Passport to purity book,This book is all the information from the passport to purity program. Nice to have if you want to review part or all of the program without going throught the CDs again.
1,Touch it loose it.,Do not waist your money even if it is $1.00.It shreds or breaks befor you start working with it!
5,The definitive recording of Boheme,"Without question, the definitive recording of La Boheme. Jussi Bjorling and Victoria de los Angeles are at the height of their powers. The rest of the cast is amazing as well. ""Digital-only"" bigots may object to a mild hiss - after all, the recording was done in 1956... but real opera lovers should not miss out."
5,A must,"This is a fantastic recording, headed by the most consistent and beautiful-sounding casts on record. None of them has been surpassed for pure beauty of tone. Only Callas matches de los Angeles in her involvement and poignancy. Bjorling is, as always, fantastic. Beecham's conducting is superb as well. The only drawback is the sound quality. It is the worst recording job I think I have heard from this period from a major label. It sounds more like 1946 than 1956, but this should still not stop opera fans from purchasing this definitive recording."
5,There was a stereo version of this recording,"All the glowing reviews of this performance are well deserved. I just want to add that Angel-Seraphim released a genuine stereo version of this performance a few years ago on LP. It seems that they didn't intend to make a stereo version, but recorded the orchestra with one microphone and the singers with another. Years later it was discovered that an acceptable stereo release could be made. The orchestra wasn't heard in anything like a real stereo presence but the singers gained tremendously. The record companies are too purist now to release this on CD but it was good to have on LP. I hope they reconsider."
1,Mike McGhee Fools Another,McGhee is a well-known fascist self-promoter.His academic friends are suspect because they are former students unaware of his fascist ideals.
1,Obsolete test preparation,"I recently took the test that this book was meant to prepare someone for, and apparently this book was made for the older test that is not used anymore. This was a complete waste of money. Don't buy unless you collect test preparation booklets."
4,A sweet short story,"Easy to become personally involved with the gardener from the story. I felt like I was listening to old family stories as I read this piece. I enjoyed it, I imagine you might, as well."
1,"""New Age"" Soap Opera","How anyone can believe that there is a power to help people live a long lifegoes beyond my comprehension. This is what Estes claims in this book. What about those who live short lives?The whole book is geared at American middle-class readers who in general, even thoughthey have college-education, are very naive. The language is that of the fairy-tale, or close to it,which suits a tv-fed and tv-indoctrinated people. Estes says that pain will clarify everything.I pained myself through her book and nothing was clarified."
4,Humble Pie,"Good , but not essential...remaster is perfect though..can not wait for remaster of ""Rock On"" please hurry up...thank you agin.."
5,humble pie,great album had it on vinyl years ago happy to replace it on cd worth a listen he bluesy humble pie
4,Cesar's best yet!!,I loved this album so much when it first came out. It needs to be re-released as not enough people know about it. The pop songs are beautiful and the guest vocalist Cesar has on the album is amazing. Some unknown singer named Mario Vasquez. I am sure it won't be the last we hear from that young star. Cesar Maroll has a knack for unleashing little gems out into the World. This one doesn't disappoint!H.
3,Cesar,"I bought Cesar: Worlds of Change for my dad, a long time SANTANA fanatic. I've been listening to Santana since I was born, 1971 and have grown quite fond of his music as well. I think that Santana's and Cesar share the same obstacles, thier choice in singers. Cesar is Santana light if anything, not as edgy, think more acoustic or melodic. I will not deny that he is quite skilled as a player, just that his choice in singers is questionable. If you like American Idol styled, bland, technical, plastic, safe, sterile singing, then you may like this CD. If you want some anema, then look into Santana's earlier stuff with Rollie. It's funny that Cesar is no spring chicken? From the write ups you would think he is a teenager and that this CD is his first effort? If you want background music this CD may be O.K. but it is not Santana and it is not great."
5,One of my all-time faves,"I was a bit hesitant to buy this when it came out in 1990. I liked what I had heard on the radio & MTV, but I still wasn't sure. I listened to a friend's copy, however, and it blew me away. I bought my own copy in 1992, and now in 2006, this is still one of my most-played CDs. All ten songs are great - to me, there is no filler. The overall musicianship is excellent - these guys rock harder than you would expect. Overall, this is a very positive & upbeat CD. I would bet that those who like the hits from this CD will enjoy the whole CD. The non-radio songs are generally a little bit harder than the radio hits, but not much. If you're looking for positive & upbeat hard rock - ""happy music"" - I definitely recommend this CD."
3,so this is nelson,"the nelson twins score 2 really well written songs on this cd that make it the reason to have it. cant live without your love was & still is one of those times less love songs that expess is straight from the heart. i find myself singing it every time i play it. after the rain another well written song was the 2nd of the 2 best songs on this cd. the other songs just sounded flat & not as catchy as the first two hits. their father, ricky nelson would be proud of their achivement."
3,Good for old memories and old girlfriends,"I remember in 7th grade that this was the hottest cd in my school. As a young bass player at the time, I wanted to have a rock style that was just as flowing, and to have a beautiful girlfriend, because that is what came to these guys. Now I look back and it was all a dream. I am still a musician, but more complexity has entered my life. Simpleness and cliche-ness are good, but more is needed. More issues, besides feeling bad need to be adressed by these two,also more complexity of the riffs."
5,EXCELLENT DEBUT,ALl I can say is I love this Cd!! I miss this kind of music these days when everything is teenage boy/girl groups. I have seen this band way back in 1991 when House of Lords opened. Another great band. I love the harmonies and keyboards. And the good ol' fashioned rock guitar. Not to mention the amazing playing of Bobby Rock on drums. Buy this Cd it is great. Oh and by the way. It is GUNNAR not Gunner. A fan from PA
5,C'est magnifique!,"Looking through other reviews of this recording, you may read that this is too dated a recording, or of the inferiority of the Karajan interpretation. Therein lies the crux of my review...this is an older recording; though remastered, it does not sound entirely modern...nor, perhaps, should it. Karajan's interpretation of the ""Rosenkavalier"" certainly differs from Solti's. Karajan's sense of style again pervades here; if you dislike the imprint that Karajan, like all great conductors, leaves upon the work that he conducts, skip this. If, on the other hand, you are both a lover of Strauss operas, and an admirer of Karajan's work, this is an unbeatable recording, showcasing beautiful performances. Highly recommended."
4,"Quality recording, but abridged","There can be no denying the performance quality of the conductor, symphony, and singers. Karajan was able to attain the emotional and comical heights of Strauss' great opera. There are a few omissions, however, which is unfortunate. For those unfamiliar with the opera, it will be unnoticed, but this recording should be considered more for enjoyment or the study of the performance but not as a tool to study the opera itself."
3,A Disappointment Overall,"Being avid fans of the Lord of the Rings, my kids and I looked forward to this game, only to become disappointed. It is set up to be attached with other additional games, which we couldn't track down. The instructions lack in clarity and the game set up is cumbersome."
1,The worst game I've played....EVER!,"This game takes over an hour to set up and even longer to try to make sense of the cryptic directions on game-play. While I am not a huge LOTR fan, I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother who loves everything about the series.I guess the only fun in this game is how you decide to play, because the game-play directions leave you questioning which way is the correct way. After playing once and realizing we did it wrong, we tried again in a different way. After failing again, we gave up and packed it back into the box as best we could. I hope it can be returned, and if not, I'll be pawning this off on someone else (not that I want anyone else to suffer, but I don't want to have wasted my money entirely).Pass on this game completely!. If you want a LOTR-themed game, try the Trivial Pursuit or other LOTR-themed games. Anything has to be better than this!"
1,Horrible,"This is the worst game I've ever played. There is NO strategy involved whatsoever. It's like a Lord of the Rings version of shoots and latters. Even the most hard core Lord of the Rings fan could never enjoy this game. Plus, this is only 1/3rd of the game. You have to buy two more boxes to complete the game. Children wont enjoy it because its superficially complex. Adults will not enjoy it because the complexity is pointless. Its pretty picutres do not make it less tedious and boring. Do not waste your money."
2,Needs some changes.,"This game was a blast when I played it at a party two years ago, but even then I saw the flaws. This game is extremely predictable and is very lacking in stratagy. When I joined that game awile back I saw, however, that there was potential, especially in the excellent board itself. Being the hard-core gamer that I am, I bought the game with the intent of altering the rules and even expanding the game to a degree. I intend to re-write the ring cards and add some features that I have learned from my RPG experience.That said the average gamer who picks up this game will be dissapointed if he never had the intentions I did. However, even if a person were to only swap out a few of the ring cards with some of his own creation every now and than, the replayability of this game would soar. I would recommend this game to any LOTR fan who wants a great party/family game and is willing to get a little creative."
3,Attention pls.,"For Al Barney, despite he is a taleteller and lay-about, but its no surprise when a necklace as beautiful as the Esmaldi with millions of sparkling diamonds to beautify it. It raises everyone's urge and taste for it. Everyone begins to raise eyebrows at the next person considering the esmaldi necklace's cost. They could do anything to get it even if murder is the only way out. Though Al Barney knows the story of the old Esmaldi Diamond Necklace, with passion, zeal, hatred and jealousy, its still not enough to own the esmaldi. As the story unfolds, it becomes clearer and distinct that it will require more than violent to get the million sparkling necklace. But ironically, the story started and it never ends even when none is to inherit the esmaldi necklace. Once again, chase showcases the Jewel-snatch gang stuff as set in Miami but this time, with an extraordinary amount of potential that will reveal a genius talent in creative art."
2,"Informative, but not very cohesive","Unlike his friend and co-worker, Joseph Tkach (Jr), Mike Feazell provides a relatively in-depth examination of WCG doctrinal changes during the early 1990s. The book seems poorly organized and rather disjointed, even contradictory at times - Feazell jumps from topic to topic with little of a detectable outline (perhaps he produced a majority of the book by combining previous articles he had written), and often adopts an irritatingly defensive tone, but it does provide ample ""food for thought"" on many points, as opposed to Tkach's rather glossy, plastic narrative. There's less here for an outside observer, though; the book seems to be more directed at current and former WCG members."
1,u poor dopey clowns,"What a load of codswallop this all is.... The books bad enough, the reviews are even worse (most of them).... The church was ruined, thousands hurt, and nothing worthwhile achieved, and they have fourth rate nobodies bungling whatz left....Oh well, the falling away was prophesised, we'll see shortly who was right and who was wrong.... You might have to come up with some better material than this to justify your actions Mr Feazell....Cheerio... :o)"
1,Destruction of a Church,"The Worldwide Church of God was not liberated; it was destroyed by a group of power-hungry individuals who didn't, and never did like rules. I was a member of that church for ten years, and finally left when the changing trends and attitudes got to me. I couldn't deal with it any more! The changes were taking place in the late '70s, and you just never knew sometimes which way things were going to go. They'd say or do something, then, boom,all of a sudden it would change again back to what it had been or similar. I left with no hard feelings, no wish to cause problems, and an assurance that if I wanted to come back I would receive help and counselling, but a couple of years later I was told of attacks against me, and I had actually been kicked out, according to the source. I felt I could no longer trust anyone there and ended association with all former friends. That hurt!!"
1,Read raising the ruins for a more accurate version of what happened!!,"This book is an interesting read on a mans opinion. Much of what is said is misguided. He should rename the book ""How to steal a church and tell others what is right and wrong"". I am glad I didn't buy the book new so he didn't benefit from the sale. If you are going to waste your money on this book buy it used then resell it. Better yet read raising the ruins.Raising the Ruins: The Fight to Revive the Legacy of Herbert W. Armstrong"
1,The blind can not see even at high noon,"Can the blind teach or write about the truth.No they stumble and fall.Someday God will open All eyes,and you will say to yourself,those strange people that seemed happy all the time and always got dressed up on Saturday to go to services were right.Not by our own greatness but by Gods mercy and love.Calling a very few now to teach you all,in the world tomorrow.Take care everybody and I will see most of you on the other side."
2,Blades had nicks,Two of the knives in the set had nicks in them. I returned the set to Amazon. The return process was easy to use.
4,Good,"No on/off switch and one speed, but it really does a good job. I mounted it in the back of van and wired it into the rear-door light switch -- very convenient."
1,RoadPro RP-1137,Unfortunately the one I got was defective. Very noisy and you couldn't adjust the speed. I wish Amazone would check it out before sending it.
2,Disappointed and determined!,"Although the clip has a strong and sturdy grip, the fan itself did next to nothing to bring any cooling comfort into the vehicle. It was VERY disappointing and made me even more determined to finally throw down the money to fix the broken A/C in my car."
1,won't fan my fire,"This was a very poor choice in a car fan for me. It only has one speed that really doesn't blow very hard and finding a place to clip it is very difficult. It has a very strong clamp and it will leave terrible indentations if you don't do something like place a towel between the surface and the clamp.After about 6 weeks it quit working. The wires in the plug had disconnected. Looked like they were never very well connected in the first place. Rather than return it after 6 weeks of occasional use,I just decided that this was a learning experience and I will never purchase from this manufacturer again."
1,Cheap both price and results,I thought this fan was great for about 30 seconds. This fan is so floppy and cheap and it can barely ocelate on its own. The cord is sooooooo thin and within 2 days the cord became unattached from the outlet connection so now it is just junk. Spend a little more to actually enjoy some air flow!
4,Riches,Great series...Was pleased to find it on Amazon. Thanks for the amazing price and quick service! I hope to get the second season on here soon!
4,Life is river kid!,"After watching this series you may find yourself comically questioning the authenticity of the professionals in your life. Pop it in, put on the popcorn and enjoy."
5,Best Vehicle for Minnie Driver Ever,"I loved this show, and I was really sorry to see it cancelled. Minnie Driver has never been better; her character is complex and charming and Minnie plays it to perfection. Eddie Izzard is also brilliant as the con-man father of the family. I liked that the story covered Travelers in the U.S. That is a subculture that many of us know nothing about."
3,Leaves you hungry,"Not really a comedy, sometimes stressful, sometimes insightful. Ends with a question mark, probably due to the writers' strike."
1,blech,"This show is nonsense. The people being conned are too stupid to be believed and the main characters aren't much better - really, it's almost painful to watch. The show gives no credit to its audience. I only made it through the first long long episode. Insipid best describes."
1,Disappointing - and I'm a fan,"I love Minnie Driver and Eddie Izzard, but I was disappointed with this series. Wooden. Awkward. Un-funny. Uncomfortable. A disappointment."
5,The richness of The Riches,"I had only seen the first episode when I pre-ordered this and I am so glad I didn't let the rather somber tone prevent me from discovering the delight this series is. Eddie Izzard, sans drag :-( & Minnie Driver both lovingly portray their multi-dimensional characters with such care that their portrayals are more than mere stereotypes. This family could never be easily pidgeoned holed as Trailer Trash given their obvious devotion to one another. The supporting actors portraying the children give no less than inspired performances. I really appreciate the nuances that are found in the fully fleshed out characters. Despite the storyline, these characters are more human than human and their family relationships and resulting dynamics make for a real treat. I still can't believe this show was ever made..."
4,dangerous neighbour,"I will not advice this recording to those who have very good reasons to not appreciate Callas' style of singing. Few, but there are some, I think. Very few if you turn to the quality of their reasons. That style you may love it, and you can certainly discuss it. Especially in Bellini's gilded domain. The biggest, self-speaking flaw of this recording is somewhere else. Opera is not necessarily a role-case for premium singers like Callas, is theather too. It has counterparts. Giuseppe Di Stefano's Arturo is simply beyond description: outrageous, no style, no idea of what Bellini's music means. He has probably never seen any Giovanni Bellini. Fifth star would shade at the rising of that of Dame Sutherland and Mr Pavarotti."
1,"Great actress, no voice","How anyone can listen to Bel Canto sung by a singer with a hollow voice I'll never understand. Bel canto is Italian for beautiful singing! Callas was the greatest Tosca of our time, but Puritani requires the greatest technique and lot's of high notes, an area that Callas lacks. For a recording that shows the true art of bel canto, look to the 1960 recording of Puritani with Joan Sutherland. Recorded in her prime, Sutherland's performance is nothing short of phenomenal"
2,My heart says Sutherland!,"Get Sills' or Sutherland's recordings of this opera. Callas is awful. She simplifies the coloratura. Her voice is just not pretty, even though this was recorded in her prime. Sills sang coloratura better than Callas and was just as expressive. Her trill is much better than Callas', whose trill is a carefully controlled wobble. Sutherland has a far more beautiful voice than Callas. The sound of this recording is mono, not very good mono at that. The score is cut to shreds.Callas is overrated. Giussepe di Stefano is awful in Arturo's music. He can't reach the top notes without strain. His excessive emoting is more appropriate for verismo than for bel canto.Both Sills' studio recording and Sutherland's two studio recordings are better buys. Sills' recording and Sutherland's second studio recording are both complete and have excellent sound."
4,For Callas and DiStefano fans,This is a beautiful CD. It is unmistakably Callas and there is a breathtaking aria by DiStefano. The sound quality is not great (but not poor). A pleasure for Callas fans!
5,A Very Big Help,"This book is such a great help and really fills a void. I was dx'd as being in premature menopause just two months ago, and wasn't able to find much information at all; only books that briefly mentioned it in passing. So I was so thrilled to learn about this book. The information on the emotional side of things, in particular, has been a great help to me. I highly recommend this book if you are going through menopause at an early age."
5,I am so excited about your book,"I was in shock last night upon seeing your book written up in Newsday. I have looked at dozens of books on menopause/perimenopause and have only seen 1 page at maximum on this subject. I was just dignosed with early menopause at 42. My husband and I were trying to conceive with our first child. This dignosis was heartbreaking, overwhelming, etc.. I have seen related web sites but nothing specifically on early menopause which I have heard is different than premature ovarian failure. I will try to get the book today. Kathryn I applaud you for offering a book on this subject which needs so much attention. I will visit your web site and would love to get involved with any future support group. Sandy"
5,Extremely helpful,"This book was a godsend to me. I can't tell you how much help it was, in terms of explaining very clearly what medicines and natural stuff was available and most of all letting me know that I am not alone. I cannot say enough how happy I am to have found this book and I think it is such a help to anyone who is going through this like I am."
5,Finally!!!!,I was diagnosed with premature menopause (POF) and couldn't find any information...until this book. I read it cover to cover immediately. This is such a great source of information and comfort. It's about time!
5,Very Informative and Easy to read!,Anyone who has received this diagnosis knows you go through an extreme swing of emotions. I didn't know where to turn and I'm glad I found this book. It is written by a woman who was diagnosed and going through POF and includes lots of stories/quotes from women who are also experiencing it. I found it to be very helpful and felt less alone. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is going through this. I am also recommending that my MD get this book to give to women that they give this diagnosis to as they were not equipped to explain to me what this book did simply.
1,info from where?,"Concern re info - see ""Making Sense of Menopause"" (Cone pg 43, '93) ""Progesterone makes the lining of the uterus more receptive to the egg; prepares the body for pregnancy by increasing your appetite, metabolic rate, and fluid retention; ....... and prevents the pituitary gland from releasing FSH and LH, thus halting the growth of more follicles."" See ""The Premature Menopause Book"" pg 18 -... ""it is responsible for making your uterine lining more receptive to an egg and making your body in general better prepared for pregnancy by increasing your appetite, your fluid retention, and metabolic rate. It also signals the pituitary glandto stop releasing more FSH and LH, and so prevents more follicles from growing."" - no reference, no citation, no mention in selected bibliography. What's the story?"
3,Best of,"This is a nice cd, not too overrated. It seems as though it is the new trend to bring out greatest hits cds: britney, robbie, eminem, mandy etc"
4,What a help!,"I bought this book based on the reviews on Amazon. Boy, has it helped! It is clear and not full of medical jargon that is hard to understand. I like the fact that this was written by a woman who went through the process and a fertility doctor. It seemed to be the perfect blend. A must read for anyone going through this!"
2,"Interesting, but...","This book was good, but not what I expected based on all the reviews I read on Amazon about it. I was expecting GREAT, not simply good. No big slam, just not worth the hype. Not much different, really, than what is already out there on the bookshelves... which is OK, but I was hoping for something more earth-shattering --not just another doctor's perspective and all the same medical techniques described, blah, blah, blah.Truth is, I should have checked this book out first at the bookstore to see if it was right for me. It wasn't a total waste of money, but didn't really address what I was looking for. I will pass it along to a friend who is getting ready to IVF...Bottom line -- I guess you shouldn't buy a book just based on reviews. Do some investigation first."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I was surprised that I did not like this book as much as other reviewers. On the plus side, it does cover a lot of information. However, sometimes the information was summarized to such an extent that it was inaccurate. As an example, when describing how to use OPK's, the authors say that if you have irregular cycles, you should use an OPK every few days. However, as OPK packages tell you and other books say, you need to do it EVERY DAY or else you could miss the one day of the surge. There are other places where statistics are summarized to the extent that they are not accurate. Finally, there are typos and spelling errors through the book. This type of lack of care makes me concerned about what other types of errors might be in the book."
2,I've read better,"I have been struggling with infertility for years. I finally decided to buy a new batch of infertility books. This journey is dark and this book made it even darker. It confused me and I didn't quite understand a great deal of it. I prefer friendlier reads that are more accessable like the new book I just bought"" A FEW GOOD EGGS ( TWO CHICKS DISH ON OVERCOMING THE INSANITY OF INFERTILITY)."" Now those women spoke my language. This book didn't."
2,One of the worst books I've read,"I found the tone of this book extremely condescending and alarmist, particularly in relation to IVF.The basics were fine, but I could get that from any other fertility book.I am pretty offended that it included info on ""designer babies."" Maybe this is a book for those who really are not confronted with infertility and have all the money in the world and are able to choose their baby's sex and bioengineer a kid, but I certainly am not one of them."
2,Reads them all,"After reading all these reviews, I bought the book thinking I was buying THE infertility book must-have. It's OK. Not great, not bad, but not what the hype here led me to believe. I'll keep it in the library, but I'll be more careful about buying based on reviews here."
1,Bad Bad Book,All I can say is please don't buy this book. It was harmful and confusing to both me and my husband. I am so sorry I bought it. Shame on you Daniel Potter for taking making this whole process more difficult then it should have been.
5,Gave Us a Reason to be Hopeful,"I just remarried and my husband and I desperately want a child. When his golf buddy told him about this book he told me about it with such enthusiasm that I purchased it for him.He had warned me two years ago that he wasn't sure he could have kids. After his family physician diagnosed him with cancer as a child he just wasn't sure. But after reading this book he felt more certain it was a possibility than ever before.After staying up all night reading it myself I have to agree with him. The authors wrote an informative and inspirational book that has truly changed our outlook on having a family.If you're having a hard time getting pregnant, this is one book you'll want to add to your reading list. We've even shown it to friends who have been through infertility treatment and all wish they knew back then what we know now."
3,Handy if you are new to infertility,"I got this book to get more information on what happens to treat prolonged fertility. Unfortunately I'd already learned most of the information contained in this book doing research on the topic on the net. It is handy if you don't want to do a search and has significant detail. Perfect book for someone who is just starting the infertility journey. If you've been on the trip for a while like I have, it's only handy as a reminder reference."
3,There's no new hope in this book,It has a reasonably good and well-written summary of the usual information about the subject. Nothing really new.
1,Focus on depression not mania,"I was very disappointed in this book. A great deal of the information is focused on depression of which there is plenty of information out there. I saw no new information in this book and not too much on mania. There are only two alternative treatments listed and one of them is contraindicated for bipolars because antidepressants of any type can trigger mania. The book does mention this, but my point is there is not any new information in it and it seems suited to depression more than bipolar."
2,Not among the best on the subject,"I've read about ten books on the subject, this was cursory in some important areas and didn't have the latest information on the newer medications."
2,New Hope - Or - Old Hat?,"New Hope for People With Bipolar Disorder may be an exceptional foundation for newly diagnosed individuals, but the book really has nothing new to offer. I found that the material in the book was poorly presented and interlaced with verbiage. Despite the title, no new hope is presented for readers. The overall rating of this book is ""one HUGE disappointment"" in a binding."
2,No new Info.,"Nothing new here and almost nothing about mania, hypomania and its various forms. Heavy focus on depression which is generally well understood. I felt nothing for the woman who supposedly has bipolar and cowrote the book--could not identify one bit. Nothing about the newer drugs which have been recommended to me and which led me to buy the book since it was about ""new hope"". Bunch of psychodrivel about taking charge of your life which might as well have been written by Tony Robbins. I don't want some motivational book. I was loooking for a more serious discussion.Save your money."
1,Hopeless,"Unless you are a layperson and very new to bipolar disorder, this book is just a regurgitation of very old techniques. What's more, the regurgitation is often wrong. Anyone who has dealt with this illness for more than a year will know more than this book can teach them.I would recommend almost any book over this one. Dr. Fieve's book Moodswing is particularly good, as is anything by Kay Jamison.If all you want is a feel-good, fast read, not particularly enlightening book, this might be for you. Otherwise, keep looking. Anyone you know with bipolar, or you, if you are afflicted, will be thankful for it."
1,Never buy from Horizon Fitness!,"I bought a Horizon CST3.5 Treadmill in 2006. Now it's broken. Horizon Fitness contracted his customer support to another company. That company charged me $99 upfront just for someone coming to my house to look at it. Then the guy who should come gave such hard time to make an appointment. He almost want to come to my house next year. I spent more than half hour for just set up an appointment with him. My money is already gone. Otherwise, I would rather to buy a new one instead of suffering from this guy. Don't ever buy from this company again. Next could be you!"
3,"OK for the money, but not ideal for heavy use.","We've had this treadmill for exactly 1 year and it gets regular use. It had been fine up to this point, but we had to have the belt and frame replaced last week - thank goodness for the warranty. The technician that repaired it said that this model has a very weak frame and cracks are common. Ours had cracked all the way from end to end! I suspect that part of the problem is my husband's heavy running because I had never had any problems with it and I normally just walk or jog lightly. The belt also slips and rubs the sides sometimes. It's a decent value for the money and great for walking or light jogging, but if you intend to use it for heavy running, invest in the more sturdy gym-quality ones."
1,Warranty is useless! Horrible customer service,"The motor went out after 6 years. My model was actually the cst 3 club series model, but since you only get infinate hold when you call in it doesn't really matter what model it is... I have tried 3 times, each ended when I hung up after waiting on hold for over 45 minutes EACH times. I did love the treadmill.. But will NOT buy this brand again. Check into the issue before purchasing..."
2,Fantasy nudes.,"If your looking for ideas, fine. But, one can search the web or look through magazines or go to the library to get your creative juices flowing. Save your money and start thinking for yourself!"
4,"Nice for beginners or if you want a ""short"" workout!","I am an advanced exerciser, so with that said, this was a little ""low energy"" for me - BUT - I was looking for something to supplement my morning workout, that I could do in the evening, that would not require a lot of time. This is it! It is challenging enough for an evening workout to keep my metabolism revved up for night time fat burning. So I am pleased with the purchase/DVD. If you are an intermediate to advanced exerciser, this might be too easy for a main workout. I am using this with Jillian Michael's more advanced exercises that I do in the morning. I love the Firm videos though - :)"
4,Fast 20 minute workouts,"This video is great if you only have a short amount of time to workout. Each of the two workouts on the DVD is only 20 minutes long. The 8 second minibursts keep the workout challenging. The steps on the cardio segment were a little complicated, but I learned them after 4 workouts. I do find that I have to stretch a little more on my own after the workout. But I do feel great after the video and the time goes by very fast, before you know it, the video is over."
5,Fabulous,"I just finished this book, and rated it 10/10. I can't really describe it well, it works on so many different levels, and what it is ostensibly about is not what it is really about, mostly.....but luckily, other people have managed to give you a clue in their reviews. It does start out a little slow, but then it gains steam until it is a freight train that will knock you dead. If you are a grown-up that likes fantasy, then I most strongly recommend this book. :)"
4,Good Feel Movie,Cute movie makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside with a twist at the end of the movie. A good movie when on a date.
3,Life is like Gambling.,"This movie I sort of didn't connect to much with based on the usual interest I have on movies,Although I can say it was an interesting plot-line where one can interpret that life doesn't always go as planned and it did have lots of funny moments and I was continually following along & the plot line didn't stray from the original goal.But truely, every one should see this at least once, it is funny,and it does show you how things can be connected in the end.Deborah Elliott"
2,"More of a dull luster (oxymoron, yes)","I'm a big fan of Jamie Kennedy and I've been waiting for three years for this movie to come out. I think if he weren't in it, this movie would have gotten one star instead of two. His was the only likeable character. All the others had either no effect on me or annoyed me to the point of disbelief. It just didn't feel like it fit very well together, and I couldn't wait for it to end. Kennedy's sweet, realistic performance was the only redeeming quality."
4,Benjamin Franklin Home Vodio,"This move was educational but nowhere as good as John Adams, would I recommend buying this item, yes."
4,Richard Easton steals the show,"I fell on this by accident, and loved it. I was in a real history mode about 2 years ago, and grabbed this. I really can't remember why, but I have to admit out of all the documentaries from the channels that sell life insurance this is my favorite.Its informative, accurate, and if watched on your laptop/desktop - you may want to investigate the background materials online that are discussed (or acted).The acting is good. Richard Easton is a true professional, and the rest of cast does an above average job as well - for a documentary. The commentary from experts is equally as pleasing, and quite balanced. It stays on point and leads from beginning to end like a good book.Well worth a buy for the facts, acting, and return value. I give this 4 stars as it is not anamorphic, but letterboxed widescreen (not enhanced for 16x9 TV's)."
5,Excellent,Beautifully written book made difficult by the complexity of the man and still an enjoyable read.
5,great documentary,one of the best documentaries of franklin...shows the dual nature of the genius and the man.
4,Ben Franklin Documentary,"Loved this documentary. Went between historians talking to actors playing the role. If you want to learn about Ben Franklin, this is a great way to do it."
4,Book was just as expected,"Book was well taken care of, and had good quality, it looked like new, except for the giant USED sticker on the side which kind of ruins the cuteness of childrens books. The pages werent torn or dirty, and the price was reasonable."
4,Fatting,"Being In the hellish situation I Am In I can Not get It together to buy fresh Fruits and Vegetables so I buy this, I was drinking Ensure but Its even more fatting and Ensure has bacteria In It that makes Me smell like a Chicken house or a sewer plant. There Is Nature's Way Alive but It only came In Vanilla which I did Not like the taste of and one can I did Not even open for 2 years or so and like the Apple Cinnamon even less, Nature's Way Alive now comes In Chocolate I have Not tried It yet plus It cost like $10.00 less than Natures Plus. I like all the flavors of Nature's Plus except Chocolate this has more of a Banana taste than Strawberry I like It."
4,War of the Monsters,I ordered this game for my kids who had played it at a friends house. We could not find it in the stores. They really enjoy playing this game and introducing it to other friends as well.
5,The best game out for PS2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"War of the Monsters is a game for all ages(not too young, anyway the game puts you in as one of ten different monsters. Its fighting system and controls make it easy for anyone to pick up!!!! To top it off, you won't be able to put the game down for hours. It'll be a favorite for years to come. I hope they make a sequel!"
5,Godzilla meets Rampage!,"We've only been able to experiment with the demo, but so far it's a terrific game! You can choose from all kinds of different monsters -- from a King Kong-like monster to electric energy monsters. As you battle your opponent, your monster can pick up cars, pieces of buildings, etc. and throw them at each other. The 3-D environment is captivating. You won't be able to put it down!"
4,Unique Little Fighting Game! Just Too Bloody Short!,"This game took me by surprise as being one of those quirky games that sparks your interest immediately as being different, not quite a Rampage or King of Monsters or a wrestling game though it certainly has the feel of a combination of different games. Anyway it's quite fun, even better with a buddy playing along. The action kicks pretty intense and you have two additional monsters you can unlock with a point system and use as well. My only gripe with War of the Monsters is that the one player story game is too short. Otherwise this game is a fine addition to your PS2 library."
4,One of the Best PS2 games yet1,"This is one of the best games ive played for PS2. It's fun to try to beat your freinds or the CPUmonsters with every monsters. Even though theres only 8, and 2 unlockable ones, it's still really fun.My Best Monsters:1. Raptros (unlockable )He Looks Like a dragon, Breathes fire, flies etc.2. TogeraLooks like a Godzilla lizard thing. Breathes green acid/fire, jumps really far3. KineticlopsLooks like a cyclops made out of electricity. He's kinda slow, but his projectiles can lock on a move diffeerent directions4. Zorgulon (unlockable)5. Robo-476. Congar7. Preyator.8. Magmo9. Ultra V10. Agamovery very fun game."
4,CoOl!,"This is a really cool game, i borrowed it from a friend and played it for 2 hours with him! it IS SO FUN! in 2 player mode anyways. In the single player mode is WAY TO DIFFICULT, i tohught i could handle the medium mode, but it killed me within 2 minutes, so i tried easy, i killed him, once! If you have any body to play with, or having a party, i would reccomend the eytoy, and this game, for the best game party EVER! SO FUN!"
2,Boring and Dull. Weekend Rental at Best.,"Incog was in production of this game, and true, this game does have some good graphics. True, the game includes several different monsters with different abilities. However, many faults lie in this game. The single-player is dull and tedious, where the computer AI is cheap and very cheap. True, this cheapness may work in Twisted Metal: Black in single-player, but then again, you have shields that surround the car as you escape whereas in this you don't. You can get stabbed in the back quite frequently with an antenna. In terms of multiplayer, it's okay, but then again, Twisted Metal: Black is far better. Overall, this game is a weekend rental at best. Incog, please stick with Twisted Metal for the sake of your fans!"
4,"Cute, fair replay value.","My boy and I have lots of fun with this game. You can unlock a fair amount of characters and costumes, but overall the replay value is pretty limited.A very sweet game though. I love these little monsters. Not awfully creative, but fun nonetheless.(Smashing buildings is especially fun)."
4,A must buy for this price!!!,"There is a ton of stuff you can do in this game! Pick up objects and throw them at your enemy and you can even pick up an I-beam and hit objects back that are thrown at you or catch objects thrown at you.(It does take some timing though)Great game play, easy controls,(Easy enough for my daughter to play with me which is great!) and easy concepts on what is going on. Lots of extras like skins,places to fight, and characters.As far as the one player adventure mode it does take some time to getting use to fighting two monsters at one time because they are relentless.The downfalls are no 4-player mode or online experience, the camera views are tricky at times, lock-ons should be on the monster closer to you, and no two player cooperitive.It makes up for what it does'nt have very easily. The best part is my 4 year old daughter still has'nt beaten me!:)"
4,Very good,When I recieved the game it was in mint condition and even had the manual and poster. The disk was almost flawless and I am not disappointed at all. The game itself is very fun and I used to play it all the time and I'm happy I can finally be reunited with it.
4,it's fun,"great multiplayer action, the controls take a little getting used to (I recommend switching to a different preset than the default, I think it's the second one that's good, I can't remember) but it's a good brawling game. Play it with your step-dad and bond. He wants you to like him!"
3,Fun to play through the first time.,[...]This game is really fun to play through the first time but gets really old really fast. My 5 year old can play it and he's pretty good. He'd play this game all day long if I let him but for a gamer that has been at it for a while this game will only be fun for a week... MAX!
4,fun but it gets old after a while,"the game is alot of fun 2 player but after about an hour it starts to get old but it is worth. so you should buy it,"
4,Panasonic BL-Pa100A,"It works perfectly, with no detectable speed loss. I am entirely satisfied. I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because the instructions weren't entirely correct. They stated to only plug into a wall outlet, not a power strip, I got it working using either. The other items plugged into the same outlet/power strip are what can cause the 2 adapters not to sync."
5,It works!!!,"I was very skeptical that this would work, but it works great. You need at least two, One's the master the other you hook to the computer that you want to set up to the internet. I bought two, now I have Five."
5,Panasonic Ethernet Adaptor,"Ordered and Ethernet Adaptor. Received my order in less than a week. Simple hook up of units (2 required). Worked as advertised. This is my third order from Amazon, and I have been very pleased with the service. I will be purchasing more items from Amazon."
5,"Great product, great price!!!","I had previously purchased a starter pack from Office Depot for about $150. After installing them, I really liked how the product performed and was looking to get additional adapters for other network ready equipment that I have at home that is not located close enough to my wireless router to give reliable performance. I initially thought this would be an expensive project but at $25 a piece it was well worth the investment. My only regret is that I did not use Amazon when I purchased the starter set. Now I have a complete home network with no limitations of distance and without wires running all over the house.Panasonic BL-PA100A HD-PLC Ethernet Adaptor"
1,Didn't work at all,"I bought these for a friend who asked me to investigate. I thought if they worked - I would keep them. I purchased a 'pair' and an additional remote unit for my personal environment.I could NOT make them work unless both parts were powered through the same electrical outlet. I sent them all back and took a hit on return shipping plus a restock charge on the 'single' unit I bought. I ended up buying something else that worked like a dream for my friend and he still has them. For me... I'm still suffering with a bad wireless signal.I should point out that I have an electrical engineering background, and worked with power-line carriers 30 years ago in one of my first jobs. So - for these things to 'stump' me... they had to be pretty bad."
1,Be careful when you buy the additional adaptor for you existing network,"I bought a starter pack of two. They are working alright. Then I bought the 3rd one thinking it should be connecting as easy. But I was wrong. The 3rd unit I bought from Factorydepot simply does not work. No matter what I tried, it can not recognize the existing network. So be careful!"
3,Not a good setup,I purchased this item without realizing the server/client aspect of the product. As I see no reason for this limitation I returned the items and purchased a Netgear solution instead - client to client - which is exactly what I wanted in the first place.
3,Good recording...but,get the earlier account by Nigel instead. It had more warmth and soul than this one. He really misses it in the finale. This work should leave you weeping.
3,In defence of the art of opera...,"It is so sad to read reviews like the ones this Theo person writes. It's perfectly all right to love a certain artist but to bash all others who've performed the same repertoire is unacceptable. Why don't you stick with Maria Callas, which to you is the only soprano for the entire Italian opera repertoire and stop throwing mud to other legendary names.You claim to know so much about music...I'm sure you think you know more about music, voices and opera than Toscannini, De Sabata, Serafin, Boehm, Mitropoulos. After all, these legends were ALL DEAF and couldn't hear what a bad and cold singer Renata Tebaldi was. Callas groupies (this is to differentiate you from the true Callas fans who respect her art in general) have always behaved this way; You're a disgrace to Callas' vision and art.This is by the way a nice recording of Forza. The cast is a bit uneven but Serafin and Callas are wonderful. By no means a definite recording but certainly an interesting one."
3,Callas is okay- Price the ONLY VERDI SOPRANO????,"Callas, not my favorite, could sing Verdi well so could Leontyne Price. Any statements suggesting that these were the only Verdi sopranos - Opera Lover's refusal to acknowledge anyone but Price suggests either very limited listening experience- what about Ponselle, or Milanov or poor hearing.In this role Tebaldi is as good as I ever heard although she did not sing as much Verdi as the above mentioned divas. CAVEAT!!!! Unfortunately, I did not hear Ponselle either live or in the whole opera or all bets might be off with Tebaldi. Ponselle was a unique vocal and dramatic presence."
1,Dramatic Verdi Not for Callas,Callas should have known that just because she could act the part doesn't mean she could sing it...I will say--if you want to hear verdi at the hands of a great soprano---LIsten to Leontyne Price--she is the ONE and ONLY Verdi Soprano--Callas was not cut out to hang with her in this rep--stick to Bel canto callas
1,I ordered this because I want the drivers side Mirror,"I am not sure what I will get when it arrives, Drivers side?, Passengers side?, Folding or not?I want the drivers side mirror, but the product description says this is the passenger side.Also it says this IS a folding mirror, but the product description says this mirror does not fold.I guess I will find out what I ordered when I finally get it???I give this negative 4 stars because of the contradicting poorly written product description.Maybe I am weird or something, but when I shop for parts for my cars I like to know that I am ordering the correct part.P.S. the price is good so 1 star for that :)"
2,"overall, nice","the knife is great, but unless you have chicken legs, the sheath will be too small. i'm not a big girl, tall, but not big. and the straps for the sheath are way too small for my legs. you'll need to buy a new sheath if you want to wear it regularly."
5,SHARP!!!!!!,Tis is a really good and reliable knife got to me really quick and the only thing is that the hande and a little scruffs on it but no big deal it dosent matte it is gunna be inure hand the whole time ure usingit and it can be strapped to ure leg also gobe witha tough cloth sheath and not a plastic one but still i would recemend to anyone ... and it is one of the sharpest knives i have ever owned.
1,BEWARE! This is an Asian Group! It is NOT JUDE from AMERICA!,"This CD is all in another language. It is not JUDE as we know him. It is JUDE, and asian rock group! I bought one and regretted it."
3,Very informative but choppy,"As far as the history of the freemasons it's pretty informative, I just wished it was a little more to the point at times. It strays alot into general history which sometimes seems relevant to how it relates to freemasons and sometimes doesn't. I found myself skipping over alot of random history about different kings to get back to the parts about the masons. He also jumps around alot through history and there are several things that are hard to connect to each other when they are so out of chronilogical order."
2,"Maybe so, maybe not","I purchased this book for its catchy title, ""a history of the secret society"". Instead of a history of the secret society, I got a history of the American Revolutuion, the French Revolution, and several other revolutionary movements worldwide. Being told that some revolutionaries, politicans, artists, and intellectuals were Freemasons and that some were not, just as some were corrupt and some were not, gave me no insight into the organization itself. I felt as though the author was playing a game of ""maybe so, maybe not...guess if you can"". What little information I derived from this book was contradictary, such as the requirements of 'believing in one God' and 'not discussing politics', yet athiests were admitted and both right-wing and left-wing groups with strong political views controlled the lodges. I would recommend reading a book that discusses the society itself more so than one that discusses the people involved, or in this case-- 'not involved'."
3,"Decent, not that objective","I wouldn't say this book is objective as I find a slight pro-mason attitude on it.The reason I say this is because the author quickly dismisses any possible fact that apparently is not properly documented that would present the freemasons as wrongdoers, calling the ideas ridiculous, while in other instances he takes a simple popular song as a historical proof because it serves him."
1,What a disappointment,"I found this book to be quite disappointing. It appears to be a lot of stories about the masons and various members strung together in a rather disjointed fashion with no real attempt at insight or analysis. I also found a number of the author's ""facts"" to be either incorrect or misleading which makes me suspect the accuracy of the book as a whole."
3,Stay Focused,"After reading this book it is very apparent that Mr. Ridley is a very gifted researcher and historian. He has trouble, however, staying on topic in this book.I purchased this book because I was curious about the Freemasons. Its the first and only book I've read on the subject and my expectations were high. I was somewhat dissappointed, however, when Mr. Ridley got off topic for pages and pages. It seemed, at times, that I would never learn anything new about the Masons. There is good information in the book, its just very, very hard to find it.Ridley may be better off sticking to broader topics where his digressions will be more appreciated."
4,A Very Interesting Read,"I recently read this book and found it extremely interesting. It provides a look at the history of Freemasonry around the world. It is well written and doesn't get so in depth that it's hard to understand, as some histories of Freemasonry are prone to do.My only complaint with the book is that, at times, it was hard to decide if Ridley was referring to ""Operative"" or ""Speculative"" Masonry. Still though, recommended reading."
5,The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society,This book was purchased for my Partner for a Christmas present and he is Enjoying it very much
1,The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society,"The book open my eyes more about this great organzation, that i glad to be a part of"
4,"At last, a good introduction to freemasonry","I have been searching for an introduction to freemasonry for some time. Unfortunately, most of the literature I found was written by enthusiasts - how wonderful freemasonry is, how important its accomplishements, etc. A few other authors wanted to show how dangerous it is.This author provides a many sided picture of a complex group or process that has evolved over centuries. I agree with the blurb from The Economist, shown on the cover of this book: "" a meticulous, sane, and lucid book.""As a general reader I rate this book four stars for the valuable service it provides, and for its readibility. Were I to step into my academic/intellectual shoes, it would be three stars, for its fast-paced gallop over so much time and so many places, dealt with somewhat superficially.In sum, the book gave me exactly what I wanted, an interesting introduction to the history and belief system of this movement."
2,Whoa! Author is mixing apples with oranges,"It is strange for this book to compare the career of Jeb Stuart, Lee's chief-of-cavalry until 1864, with George Custer. Phil Sheridan was Grant's cavalry chief and Custer's commander. Therefore, comparing Stuart to Sheridan is more correct. It then follows that, although Sheridan did favor Custer among his lieutenants, it is monstrously wrong to state 1 man (Custer), and not his commander (Sheridan), drove the Confederates out of the Shenandoah Valley and stopped Lee at Appommatox. (In fact, it is almost legend how Sheridan, by personally leading a counter-charge at the last Valley battle at Cedar Creek, was himself most responsible for ending the Valley campaign.) It is incredible that the book reviews above repeat such inaccuracies. There are much better books of both generals."
3,Worth The Effort,"While there are better books detailing the records of both Custer and Stuart, none makes the comparisons that this book does. In isolation, each man appears to be head and shoulders above their piers, but comparing both in the same book, gives one a true comparison of their accomplishments and failures.

3,NOT ENOUGH PLEASURE FROM THE BUDDAH GROUP,"Yes !! A box set from the Buddah Group. Oh Boy !!This 3 CD set could have fit on 2 CD's and saved some plastic. As it stands, there is no reason for this to be in a box. It is void of a lot of Buddah / Kama Sutra (and their subsidiaries) product and as another reviewer pointed out, Disc 3 has some real crap on it.Anyway, I'm glad they put it out but it is a poor showing of what should have been an ambitious product this time around.This set is missing ""Scorpio"" by Dennis Coffey, ""I'm Not My Brother's Keeper"" by The Flaming Ember as well as ""5,10 15 20"" by the Presidents."
3,It was the 60's man,"""The Buddah Box"" is a three disk, 45 song compilation of the songs of Buddah Records. Perfect, it's not, interesting for sure.It's a little bit of bubblegum, a little soul, some rock and roll, and some just plain weird stuff.

1,great when it works,"I used Pagis Pro 3 (part of PP Millenium)for several months. It was very slow and crashed from time to time. I did like it's features, though. I was able to customize scans and got good copies. Textbridge worked OK with b & w typed material but made lots of errors with color magazine articles and took ages to correct.Since upgrading to IE5.5 I haven't gotten Pagis to work. Scansoft's patch and technical support haven't solved the problem either.Overall, a good program (when it works), but buggy."
2,"Software great, BUT WYSIWYG","Don't expect much from scansoft in either updates or customer concern. I would've paid for a new XP compatible upgrade. However Scansoft showed me no concern or regard for us ... who bought the original pagis and then the upgrade. I will do without an ""easy"" document handling solution before I will deal again with Scansoft Inc."
5,Too amazed to say a word!,"What a great program!! I read the reviews of some other customers and did not want to buy the software. I got it at a special price, however, and decided to go for it. I was holding my breath - expecting the worst. But what a joy!! From the moment ""go"" everything just worked perfectly. The installation was a easy as 1-2-3. I did not have to configure my scanner or change any settings. I opened the program the first time and scanned a document from a magazine. Then I sent the document through the OCR to Word 2000, with great results.Make sure your computer and scanner are ""up-to-date"" and I am sure there will be no problems. If you don't have the sofware yet, rush to the shop before they sell it all. Feel free to e-mail me for more information: labmau@intnet.mu"
4,Timi does it better,"I bought this cd after hearing ""Did I Ever Love You"" duet with Willie Nelson. After listening to the entire cd, ""Will You Remember Mine"" is my favorite because of the emotion Timi brings into it--better than ""Hurt"" and ""I Apologize"" from her early years and better than Willie's own rendition. Timi Yuro is one of the best singers I've ever heard and I agree with so many others that she deserved more recognition and fame than she achieved."
5,Gone but never forgotten,"The last album from the greatest white soul singer who ever lived . Timi never recieved the recognition she deserved, and this is a lasting treasure.She always worked well with Willie Nelson, being great friends and having known each other for many years.Her wonderful voice suited gospel, soul, blues and country, and I have never heard such emotion from any singer, whatever colour.This lady should have been a massive star, and nobody can explain why she wasn't.Luckily her faithful fans stayed with her for forty years, and we are lucky to have been able to share her through her music.She was a one off, never to be repeated. Sadly missed for everFrom Mike Rossiter, England"
4,The only book on Celine BY Celine herself,"There's a difference between other books ON Celine Dion and this one. This is a book which is authored BY Celine Dion herself. Therefore, Celine stands behind all what is said in the book. If you are loking for some truthful and quite candid revelations, buy it. If you are looking for gossips on Celine, I guess you won't find them in this one.The book is a first attempt of Celine to try the ""outfit"" of a real star. Not ""some"" star, but a major STAR who she became after the Titanic. She tells all about how it happened, how it became possible, and how it feels without overloading you with the details of her childhood and other corny things. It goes right into what Celine is about - Life and Dreams.I think it is a good book. In fact I used it a lot while creating my Celine Dion web site celinedreams.com. If you are a fan, it is a must have book!"
3,snore.........,"I will admit that I found this book to be quite interesting in the beginning when she talked about how she was brought up. However, the story starts to drag at the middle of the book."
4,"Good, but write a sequel!","When she finishes the book, she's finally become pregnant. She wishes it to be a little girl, because she feels that a little boy would be cold to her. She did end up having a little boy. I would like to see how this has worked with her career, her time at Caesar's Palace, and her fathers death. Many of the stories in her book are very touching, but she tends to be on the melodramatic side more times then not. I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that it was disturbing to read about her ideas of seducing Rene Angelil when she was 14. Rene and Celine have a beautiful love story, but at 14 that would be wrong, and it feels invading to read it. She does come across as a diva in many points, but all of these shortcomings are minor compared to the wonderful story she writes."
2,Ugh.....,"I may like Ms. Dion's voice.. This book is torture.. Maybe something got lost in the French translation... but.. in the French tradition, this diatribe is oh-so-emotional and reads like a high-schooler's attempt to write a fairy tale in composition class.. I equate reading this to eating a block of sugar.. And.. another gripe.. This book is so poorly packaged.. Could some of the pictures could at least be in color?"
5,"Loved her story, her writings, her experience & perspective!","I am ofcourse in love with Celine Dion, so I was a bit biased at first. Reading this book took me through her life from the very start, and through her stardom. Her love with Rene Angelil, her feelings for this man 26 years her senior, her view of the world, of popularity, of discipline most of all, and of her working hard and intense attitude, I fell in love with her all over again. I can't recommend the book enough, but then again, you have to love Celine the way I do to appreciate her book as much!! :)"
4,Brilliant read on the scillies,"This book gives you the wonder of the Isles of Scilly mixed in with a wonderful story, about children living on Bryher during the war, and shows the reader a different kind of life. Excellently written and a real joy."
4,"Highbrow or Lowbrow, its all Good","Gans makes the general argument that in a pluralistic, democratic country we all deserve the culture we want whether it be high or low. Some parts of the book are pretty dated, but overall this is an excellent analysis of American cultural stratification and the creators and users of that culture."
5,A Boy Endures the Hardships of War,"Young Michael is not an ordinary child. His parents are Hungarian nobility and his days are full of magic, from the stories of his beloved ""Nana"" to riding lessons. But it is World War II and slowly Michael's world begins to collapse. The family estate is taken over by Nazis and his father is accused of collaboration with them. As a small soldier in the war, Michael keeps the real truth hidden--that his father is working against the enemy--but pays for his love of the beautiful horse Midnight by losing all that he has loved.This is a beautifully written page turner of a novel with lovely illustrations by Seredy. Michael, Prince Chestry, and Nana are memorable long after the story is over, and once again Seredy glorifies the life of the ""ordinary"" farmer, who she considers to be the true royalty."
4,Any Time Deluxe Edition V 7.0,"This program works for us. We are very satisfied. Now my secretary and I are up to date all the time and connecting with my palm is a breeze. If you purchase the 7.0 version, you will need to log on to Individual Software's site and download a patch. One drawback we found is that all information in the custom areas on the palm vanished during the first sync. All of this information was still on the palm program on the computer, and had to be manually reentered into other non-custom areas. A small price to pay to be able to network information with my secretary. However, we strongly recommend that you have a backup for all of your palm information before installing Any Time and running your first sync."
1,Puhhlease!,"Whoever wrote that glowing review must work for Individual Software because this software is garbage. If you thought the Palm Pilot made your life a little more complicated, use it with this software and you'll really be hosed. Hmmm, where's that appointment I entered in AnyTime and synced with my Palm? Oh, it's gone! AnyTime randomly deleted it and now I'm in it deep! Maybe I'm being sensational, but you'll be saying things like this if you use your Palm with AnyTime. Get some software that was meant for the Palm because you won't get a refund from Individual Software once you find out their software is ruining your attempt to get organized."
2,Picture more elegant than product.,Picture has a much better presentation than the actual product. See it first before buying the watch. Hope it helps
3,"A good product, but be warned","I think this is a great little product, but before buying you need to know that it does not play Windows Media Audio (WMA) files, or any other formats, for that matter, only MP3. If that doesn't matter to you, then add a star. However, if you really want to fit a LOT of songs on the unit, then you really should be encoding in WMA version 9 at 64 kbs - the files are 1/2 the size of MP3 128 kbs files and sound almost as good."
4,Great Alternative to IPod + RECORDING,"Fantastic product. Cheaper, smaller, lighter than IPod, plus FM radio and recording. I've already used it to record radio programs and listen later skipping the commercials--like TiVo for radio. Great if you listen to specific programs daily (NPR, Howard Stern,etc)One complaint: the buttons are a bit tiny and clumsy--sometimes hard to navigate on the first try.Otherwise: FANTASTIC."
2,"Excellent quality, FATAL FLAW","Any music that you purchase online is sold in secure WMA format, this format will not be playable on this device as it will require DRM compatible software which it does not have.If you plan on downloading music to listen to from the internet it will not download to your I-Audio."
2,iAUDIO CW200 256 MB MP3 Player with FM Radio and Voice Recor,"The software is incompatible with all other software. I have to load each disk individually (eventhough I have them already on my computer). It's very annoying and time consuming and the web site provides little to no help. I don't understand how anyone can say this is an easy product to work.I will say, however, that the sound quality is very good."
3,Great....when it works!,"This MP3 player was fabulous for the 3 hours that it worked! It dumped everything I had loaded onto it and said there was no memory flash found??? Now I can't listen to my music I had saved nor can I record. I'm returning it, but now the price has gone up $30 if I want a new one. There was no offer on repairing it. I may have gotten a lemon, but I'm sure this is the best unit for the money and my next unit will be a good one."
5,MP3 perfection,"This MP3 is clearly perfection. It will obsolete my other five. Built in voicerecorder and radio as well. Smaller and lighter than any of the others, and one normal AAA battery so no annoying chargers. At 256MB it hold around 55 songs. I plan to use mine skiing, hope it holds up in the cold weather. The Nike (Rio) one could not handle the cold and would lock up.Software that comes with it is pretty good as well. Have found no disadvantages yet.I upgraded mine from 128MB to 256MB. You have to send it in but they have a super fast turnaround."
5,Satisfied in VA,"Let me tell everyone who is looking for an Mp3 player this is exactly what you want. I had no idea what I wanted when I first started looking for them but I read all the reviews and when I found this one I was hooked. The radio works great. It is so tiny it fits anywhere, literally the size of a pack of gum. The hold button is great for just putting it in your pocket, no buttons get pushed. The software was very easy to use on windowsXp I was putting songs on my player in 5 mins tops. The player itself is easy to use I didn't need to read the book and I know how to use it, no problem. The LCD light is great. It has a sleep mode in case you want to fall asleep to it. I think it may be better then my car radio in my VW! I have 38 songs on the player so far and I haven't even used up half the memory. Trust me it is worth the money. I hope I was helpful."
5,A great buy.,"I've had this thing now since Christmas, now Feb 8th, and I've used it everyday to workout whether it be running, riding a bike or weightlifting, as well as using it for regular use. I've had to change the battery only once in the entire time.The software worked great for me. It rips cds to mp3 and the interface is intuitive and easy to understand. I even taught my sister how to do it!I've had no problems with it at all. The headphones have never even fallen out of my ears when running like others have said. I have a USB flash drive and USB mouse as well and this has not interfered with them in any way."
3,Watch those file types!,"I bought this player over a year ago and loved every aspect of it. I had absolutely no complaints - sound, setup, buttons, carrying case - everything was great. Recently, however, I joined Napster and all their songs are downloaded in WMA format instead of MP3 (all music download services download in this format). This player only supports MP3, so now I can't play any of my songs on it. I called the company and asked if they were going to issue a firmware update and they repsonded that they were not going to update it and didn't have any plans in the future to support WMA formats (which to me seems like a bad business move since everything is moving in that direction). If you don't care about WMA and think you never will join a download service, then this is a great player. Otherwise, find something else!"
5,"In a word, ""Wow""","I am just as impressed as everyone else who has bought this product. If quality and ease of use mean a lot to you (and you want the bonus of a good FM radio included), definitely buy this. It's absolutely worth the money for portable music fans. It's about the size of two packs of gum, and holds over 5 CDs worth of music. I installed the program, added songs to the player, and was listening to music literally within five minutes. Ten minutes later I was listening to it at the health club, and enjoying the sharp radio reception. The seller seems to be incredibly professional as well. I ordered it the week of Christmas and it arrived here across the country in three mailing days. Another little bonus--it comes with a AAA battery so you can play with it right away. Buy this with confidence."
5,Great gloves,These are great gloves. I bought them for a costume and they are much better quality than those available at the costume shops.
3,Good for only a few nights use.,"They looked great the first couple of times I wore them, but quickly had snags and elastic popping out of the gloves. I have rather large hands, so please consider that. The look was great for what I needed them for. I paired them with a strapless dress and turned every head in the club that night. The look is very sexy and the material is stain resistant. I bought them in black, but will try other colors soon!"
4,satin long gloves,"the gloves are great, the material is not cheap, it's thick enough w/o being winter gloves, but not a cheap flimsy material. They stretch, so it helps with the perfect. I would highly recommend these gloves"
2,Cheap-looking gloves,"First of all, these gloves are not what I consider satin, they are very thin stretchy nylon. The gloves are small which was fine with me, as I have small hands, but the tips of the fingers have clumsy stitching aross them. I suppose it could be for reinforcement purposes, but it actually highlights the lower quality of these gloves. They are ok for a costume, but not to wear anywhere else. If I was aware of the low quality of these gloves I would not have purchased them, for now they are going in the 'dress-up' box."
5,Gloves were great!,"I needed these gloves to complete a costume, they were exactly as posted and arrived very timely. I would order from these folks again no problem."
1,Don't waste your money,These gloves are very narrow and do not stretch. The fingers ripped while trying to get them on so the material is cheap also.I did not hear boo from this company after returning the gloves. Didn't get my money back. Don't buy anything from them period.
3,Sexy Crazy Cool Esoteric Violent Moody Quirky Flick,"Actually found this film while channel searching on a somber Friday night; missed the beginning but after hearing the wild meandering yet sensually hypnotic voice-over of Antonio Banderas, I WAS HOOKED! Its not perfect but it is ENTERTAINING with a truly mind boggling puzzle of a mystery that after a while, you realise it's not the destination but the head-trip of a journey. I suggest chips, nuts with wine or a cocktail....turn off the lights and enjoy. And sometimes there were some truly intelligent expansive suggestions/theories being ""put out there"". Just because its a slutty tattooed waitress who is flashing her glow-in-the-dark poetic panties, doesn't mean you don't want to take a peek...................Ok, if you watched Inception, you can watch this and probably have way more fun and it isn't as long. LOL"
1,Huh?,"Antonio's accent is so thick, much is not understood. The artsy photography distracts rather than enhances. And it is so dumb. I gave up long before the end."
2,The Big Bang,"After seeing Once Upon a Time im Mexico and some of Antonio Banderas other movies I thought this would be worth a watch. I was wrong. It drags along and doesn't go anywhere. If some parts were supposed to be funny they were not. I didn't even make it through the whole movie, it doesn't put you to sleep it just lacks substance, you keep waiting for somehting to happen to give the movie some purpose but it never does. I gave it two stars I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy it."
1,Awful!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is very highly boring, its filled with boring characters, bad writing, filler and a plot that goes nowhere. Avoid this film at all costs. 0/10"
1,"Bang goes ""poof!""","When Antonio Banderas does the voice-over for a cartoon character in an advertising commercial, it's tolerable. But when his accent compounded with poor enunciation of English-language words is the voice-over for an entire movie and the speech pattern of the main character, it becomes almost like sitting through the scraping of hand nails on a blackboard. (The DVD comes with English subtitles -- need I say more?) There are films that come close to imitating ""film noir"", but this less-than-B movie is not one of them. The dialogue is loaded with buffoon gumshoe-speak that loses its comedic quality almost immediately. I lost all patience and interest after a half hour and fast-forwarded to the last five minutes. It was all I needed to piece the story together and make any sense of the plot."
4,Schrödinger's Movie,"You won't know until you watch it whether it's great or awful. Even if you failed every science course you were forced to take, you may appreciate this wonderful film noir in the great tradition of the last century. If you have even a vague idea about Schrödinger's cat, then you'll enjoy the science jokes that abound in ""The Big Bang"". And it has one of the best/funniest sex scenes I've ever seen, in a movie."
5,Extremely Entertaining!!!,"Sometimes, movies should just be fun. Do not look to Antonio Banderas and Snoop Dogg for your philosophical pursuits. It was fun, entertaining, humorous, and with just enough suspense thrown in to hold it all together. Maybe it is full of holes, but so is Emmentaler which is really great Swiss cheese;-)"
2,Green Vertical Lines,"Like others here, I purchased this TV in November 2007. It was a good TV (a bit expensive for the size) until November 2009. I now have a green vertical line on the left side of the screen. It is there no matter which input I'm using. I saw the other reviews here and didn't even want to take it for an estimate being afraid of what I might hear. But, I purchased it with my Visa card and they double manufacturer's warranties. So, I had to take it in.... $1093 for a new LCD panel! What???? I only paid $1200 for it. I would suggest steering clear of this model. I'll personally be steering clear of Sony from now on. So, let's just hope the Visa warranty actually pays out. I need to put a call in to Sony also - maybe if enough people complain they'll put out a recall."
1,Vertical line problem.,About 2 years old and experiencing vertical line problem like other customers. First problem with a Sony.
1,Another failure after 2.5 years,"A great TV while it lasted.2.5 years and my $1200.00 TV is now junk.Sony will not fix it, but will give me what amounts to a $84.50 discount if a buy another from them.There offer was for me to pay them $425.00 Plus tax for a KDLex500, only after I spend $95.00 for a Sony authorized tech to look at my old one and fax a repair cost to them.Yes I spent the $95.00 and drove 40 minutes to get Sony what they asked for. (even their authorized electronic store recommended another brand)I was convinced they would do right by me. Then they send me their offer. What a joke. Now I'm out even more money.Fooled me twice Sony and the second time is my fault. I should have known. NEVER AGAIN.RegardsDavid"
1,25 months until vertical lines problem,Mine made it 25 months of gentle use (secondary tv) until getting the vertical lines problem. Does anyone have follow-up on the outcome of the service estimates/results?
1,Problem with colored vertical lines,I have the same problem with colorful vertical lines that block the screen. We have had this tv for ~18 mos.
1,Vertical lines - Sony no help,"[...] - - I have been a diehard Sony customer since the 1980s but this is the final straw. Every Sony product has been slightly inferior than the one I have replaced and now this. I have a KDL-32XBR4 that is less than 4 years old and it has the vertical line problem that others have clearly documented. I was once willing to pay the Sony premium because it meant quality products, built to last. That is clearly no longer the case. Goodbye Sony, we're through."
3,Quality is going down?,I bought Sony Bravia KDL-32XBR4 Serial No 8025535 in September 2007. I used this TV one hour a day not every day. First problem I got almost immediately - headphone outlet gives to me sound only for one ear. Now I have a green vertical line on LCD. Before this quality of picture was excellent. What problem will be next I don't know. I am belong to Sony-video fanatics many years and never had this crap before. This is not good sign for Sony.
5,"Sony Bravia XBR KDL - 32XBR 32"" LCD HDTV",This TV is well worth the $$$. It has a great picture with the ability to see individual grass blades! You can't go wrong on this one and it is worth the extra cost over the rest!
1,2 years and done.,"Like many other current reviewers, our XBR4 just died...about 2 years to the day we bought it. Multi-colored vertical lines. Have not gotten the service tech out here yet, but I am not encouraged by others' cost estimates."
1,Big disappointment!,"we bought this TV last October and we were thrilled with it...until this October, when a year and a day after we bought it, it broke. SONY was completely unhelpful and is even trying to stick us with an additional bill for a service visit to tell us it was not repairable. I have never written a review before, but wanted others to be aware!"
1,Avoid This TV at all Costs,Same problem as I've seen on numerous websites. My Tv is shot after 2 years of use because of a bad TCON board. Sony will not own up to it and refuse to help. They have lost a Sony customer who has bought there products for 20 years.
1,Yet more vertical lines,Same problem with vertical lines. Same response (or lack thereof) from customer service. Same loss of a potential Sony customer for life. And my family. And any of my friends. Never before has such a big ticket item resulted in such a colossal failure.
5,Pure Quality,"This was my first LCD TV, and I was a little reluctant to buy one at first. I have seen so many LCD TVs that go blurry, but when I saw this one, my wife and I just knew that this was the one.. Not only that, this was rated as the #1 in it's class by Consumer Reports. I am very pleased with this purchase and I will likely buy another Sony Bravia for my next TV.Note on the specs, I only needed this TV for simply TV watching, and this was more than enough. It has all types of extra connectors in back, and I am sure I will use them at some point. All in all this TV is great as just a plug-in and watch TV as well!For the price, for someone who is picky about quality, you will get what you pay for in this product."
4,Fabulous video.,"I got the Sony KDL-32XBR4 in Nov. 2007 and it has an incredible picture. However, in early 2009 it started have ing a double image. When we slapped the back it would make it right. I finally took it to the local TV repair man. He said there was a bad connection with the T-Con board. He used a heat gun in hopes of fixing the connection, because (apparently) that was the only option for the repair. Otherwise he would have had to replace the board, which must be expensive. I hope it lasts. The TV was not much over a year old when it developed this problem . . . . it seems that electronic goods are fragile and costly. They don't tend to have long lives."
1,Sony No More!,"We purchased the 32"" Sony XBR4 in July of 2007, enjoying four years of quality images. At four years and one month, the LCD TV now shows vertical lines, requiring a trip to the local repair shop. The owner will call me after the initial $75 diagnostic check. If the panel assembly needs to be replaced, it does not make financial sense to repair it. The set becomes a recycling project.As other reviewers have noted, Sony does not seem to want to acknowledge this reoccurring problem, so you will not get any financial help from Sony. The warranty was a limited, one year coverage.If I replace the TV, it will be a Samsung. No more Sony products in our household!UPDATE 8-31-11:Local tech confirmed whole panel assembly needs to be replaced. $800+. A few calls to Sony Customer Relations, asking that their Co. cover cost of parts to be shipped to tech shop. I will cover cost of labor. In negotiations....."
1,"SONY KDL-32XBR4 (32"" Sony Bravia) - Panel gone bad","After less than 4 years of ownership, my 32"" Sony Bravia manufactured in Mexico in May 2007 is useless. Vertical multi-colored lines fill the screen....panel has gone out in it. I will never buy anything from Sony again due to the way they have left their customers hanging out to dry on a multitude of problems people are having with their tv's, and I don't know that I'll buy another tv (as flat screens are all that are made now) until the manufacturers either start standing behind their products or until they can make them last as long as tv's of yester-year used to."
1,Sony doesn't stand behind product,"My Sony top of the line 32"" FAILED AFTER LESS THAN 3 YEARS OF NORMAL USE AND THE BEST sONY WILL OFFER IS TO PURCHASE A LOWER QUALITY 32"" FOR $300. This is for a $600 tv while I spent over $1200 for the original. The attitude of their Filipino service people is deplorable."
2,"Where has Sony's build quality done?""","I did my homework. Read everything I could get my hands, polled friends and my IT folks before deciding on this model. It wasn't too hard, I am (was) a HUGE fan of Sony products. I purchased this TV at Best Buy as I got a good deal because of their spring close-outs. First one had a red vertical line of pixels out of the box , back it goes. Only TV left was a floor model. It worked great for about 5 months. Then a rainbow of veritcal lines on a white background, the picture was reduced to a 3"" vertical band on the left of the screen, back it goes. Now I'm waiting on the Service Center to see if it is repairable. Frankly, I hope it can not be fixed. Time to try my 2nd choice, SAMSUNG."
5,Sony KDL-32XBR4,Beautiful color. Saved almost $400.00 with Amazon vs Best Buy with cost plus tax. White glove service was great.
3,Dec 2005 price $937.10 (,"The price of this book on the secondary market has sky rocketed this year to its current level, $937.10. Yes, the decimal point is in the correct position!The hardcover was published in the UK in 1995, and the paperback in 1996. I believe around 5,000 copies were printed. The book was generally well reviewed in the British media and both editions sold out quickly.However, no on-line book seller has yet been willing and/or able to provide me with a convincing reason as to why my book is now fetching such high prices. I am simply told ""market forces""!Flattering at it appears, I find it hard to believe this is the whole story. For all I know, somebody whose name appears in the book dislikes the fact and has decided to put out a buy order!!So, if anybody has information as to who are the current buyers of Whitewash, or could advise me on how I might find out, I would be delighted if you would take the time and email me at [...]Many thanks!Simon Strong"
5,Simon Strong knows Colombia intimately,This book is by far the most comprehensive examination of who Pablo Escobar was and the power he commanded in Colombia.
2,Basic typography a design manual,The pachage was opened and dirty. The book was new but dirty and with part of the package glued to its back cover and had some bent corners included its cover. I was very dissapointed about it. The good thing was that the book arrived on time.
2,Deliver Me From Schmidt,"Schmidt is one of the more annoying literary characters I've recently come across: grey, pallid, 'civilized' to the point of being little more than an ageing wuss. His daughter is churlish, his lover sweet (or at least Schmidt thinks so, even when she gets pregnant by another man) but unfaithful, his next-door neighbor a lout. I kept yearning for Schmidt to get these people out of his life, or at the very least, tell them off--but no, he never seemed able to rise to the occassion. At its best, this is a dull book about a dull man. At its worst, it's an irritation."
1,Boring sequel,"I really enjoyed reading ""About Schmidt"". Of course I had to read the sequel... and was utterly disappointed. Begley had nothing left to write about. Many times he keeps repeating dialogues. I wonder who made the decision to write another book about Schmidt. Maybe the reason was the success of the first book. Well, it was a mistake. It leaves a sour taste. Many times I was thinking: ""Ok, now that is the fantasy of an old man, who would like it to be that way."" There just was not much story to tell anymore, because everything was said in the first book."
1,Schmidt Delivered,"""Schmidt Delivered"" may have been delivered to my home but IT IS NOT THE BOOK THAT I ORDERED (""Phineas Redux"").This is the first time that Amazon.com has not sent me the correct book. I should say that their 3rd partyagent, Better World Books, sent me the wrong book. The ISBN numbers are not even close to one another.Frankly, I was very surprised, very disappointed, in my purchase from Amazon, and I am a stockholder in Amazon."
2,Not the Best,"As someone mentioned earlier I must be apart of the LS bandwagon as he called it. I see it more apart of the good music bandwagon. When I was introduced to LS I heard the rerelease of Reborn and loved it. From there I got Inhabit and did not like it much. Musically the CD is good, but I don't like the vocals really at all. DJ does not have the power or intensity that makes a good screamer. After I heard this CD I got Hammering Process and Conceived in Fire and love them both. I will not buy another CD with DJ on it because it's just not as good as recent LS. Being original does not make you good!!!"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY PLEASE!,"Personally I thought that Reborn was the best CD that Living Sacrifice has ever done and with this new guy ""singing"" on Inhabit, it's just not working. The guy that sang on the old CD done a lot better than the guy that is with them now. So, Don't nuy this CD unless you want to here a person who is talking/screaming at a extremely low voice."
4,One tight album,"The tightest Living Sacrifice record. Not necessairly the best... but the tightest, hands down. Though the vocals can get annoying, they are much better than that of their earlier releases ""Non-Existant"" and ""Living Sacrifice"". The drumming and guitar playing are extremely tight. Though ""Reborn"" blows this album out of the water both musically and sonically, ""Inhabit"" is much more complex and interesting. If you like tight bands, get this. No metal could out play these guys."
3,not what i expected,this is a good cd this is defenitly old school metal though. the guitars and drums are really awesome but the vocals are where i was somewhat dissapointed. they are too strained . Like not low enough like CRIMSON THORN agreat christian death metal band. But this is still agood cd dont save up extra to buy it though its not as good as all that.
2,A Dull Knife in Stagnant Water,"Lesson One: Don't trust your local music reviewers.I bought this after reading the band's praises in a couple Austin rags. Big mistake. Remember how bad the Velvet Underground records were after all the original members left? Well, that's about what this sounds like. There's nothing remotely original or exciting here. I listened to it twice & both times I found myself praying for it to end. These kids should stick with their day jobs."
4,"Callas, a lovely Leonora","Callas is a lovely Leonora, and this recording is outstanding in it's supporting cast as well. I only wish that I could have heard Callas live. Highly recommended."
2,cannot compete with Price/Corelli,"The 1962 live Price/Corelli set also with Karajan is the finest Trovatore out there.Leontyne Price in 1962 had a glorious voice that had a throbbing vibrato that matches Corelli's. Both were power singers and the most thrilling Leonora/Manrico imaginable.Callas cannot touch Price. She simple is not comfortable at the flowing vocal lines or the high D flat in Leonora's great aria ""D'amor sul ali rosee"". The Callas set is a huge disappointment for me.Trust me, the Price/Corelli set is the definitive Trovatore.Callas might have the ability to do justice to Leonora in 1949, but not here."
1,disappointed..,"yall have costed me a lot of money acclaiming callas as the goddess of all opera, and i can't return the disappointing recording i got...over 200.00 worth...she is no diva.."
5,Why has no one else weighed in?,"I find it hard to fathom that no one else has put forth commentary on this special set, teaming the vibrant, acute Herbert von Karajan with the equally vibrant and acute Maria Callas. Their colloboration alone should be a magnet.Yes, there are a few wayward top notes but the overall effect of Callas' Leonora is mesmerizing. This opera is SO demanding: I believe it was Caruso who said, tongue in cheek, ""All it requires is the four best voices in the world."" She is joined by Di Stefano, singing the demanding role of Manrico with brio and conviction. Rolando Panerai's Conte di Luna is rich, resonant and compelling. As for Fedora Barbieri as Azucena, she will put chills right down your spine: hers is a lacerating and powerful star turn. Herbert von Karajan is totally commanding. This is truly an ensemble opera, and here we have one terrific ensemble gathered by EMI."
3,Frontline-The man who knew---DVD,"This is a great DVD program from Frontline,The topic is outstanding and this was a replacement DVD for my original that i lost. The quality was not very good and the picture quality was poor at different times my guess is that this was a copy of a copy."
3,Questions are easier than actual GMAT,"I recommend buying Martinson's book for additional practice to supplement Kaplan's or Princeton Review's materials. I caution against relying on it as the only book to use in preparation. The book is good because it gives six full length GMATs that one can use as a work-out for quantitative and verbal sections. It is bad because: (1) the questions are easier than those of the real GMAT; (2) in the quantitative section, there's a bias towards word problems at the expense of number properties questions; and (3)it includes verbal questions that don't follow the GMAT's true format very well. Advice: buy it as a warm up to Kaplan, and don't rely on it as your primary source for GMAT prep."
2,Do not waste time on this book.,"I bought this book because it was on the Sale but it's not worth the price. It would be good for GMAT introdution but not good for GMAT preparation . Answers are not explained well and found some typo error. Overall, i do not recommend this book for GMAT preparation."
2,There are better GMAT review books out there,"I would not waste your time studying this book in preparation for the GMAT. While similar, the questions are not really reflective of an actual GMAT exam. Instead of this book, I would prepare with the Official Guide for GMAT Review."
3,Ground Force Suspension,"I had a Ground Force drop kit on my 2001 Lightning, so I figured I'd try out the kit for my 2001 Tahoe Lt 4WD and I'm disappointed. The Key's for the torsion bars ruin the geometry of the suspension if you want any kind of rake on the front. It's got camber adjustment maxed out with a difference of 1"" from front height to rear height. I'm eventually going to have to buy drop spindles to correct the suspension geometry back to factory adjust-ability."
3,cute antenna topper,Be careful what car you put it on! Ford focus and Toyota corolla (maybe more cars) antennas will bend and the topper will scratch your car!
4,Worth every penny,"This one is right up there with Monster Breaks and the Trip Hop Acid Phunk series. If you like trip hop and breakbeat music, this cd rocks the whole way through."
4,Very ols school but my son loves it,"Personally, I think it is a strange video. It was made in the 80's I think. I am still amazed my son loves it so much. We rented it from the library and he loved it so much I bought it. He was only 2 and seemed beyond him but he absolutely loved it."
1,worst movie ever,"by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Slow moving, no point and really bad acting and I mean the whole thing was horrible"
5,Giulini + Chicago = Wonderful !!!,"It is nice to see that so many of Giulini's Chicago recordings are being reissued. The present release of the Mahler 9th and Schubert 8th is especially welcome as the remastering of these 1970s recordings has been so well accomplished. The more I hear Giulini's way with the Mahler 9th, the more I think it's one of the very best out there. It is completely unique in a field which grows more crowded by the year. What makes it so is hard to describe. First of all, it is a very honest and sober interpretation. At the same time, it is very warm and lyrical as well. It seems to me that Giulini believes in every note of this symphony, and this really allows his interpretation to reach the listener. As far as the Schubert is concerned, it too is a sterling performance. It is a worthy bonus to the Mahler."
1,lousy quality,This watch broke right when I put it on my daughter for the first time. Now she is heartbroken. Explain that to a four-year-old. a plastic buckle? WHO puts a plastic buckle on a KIDS' watch?save your money.
5,Back again!,"I am back to buy another one! This is a great watch that really holds up. Keep in mind, it is not waterproof."
1,It stinks!,"It's so bad it should come with a clothes pin! I love David Dochovny, but as Fox Mulder. He is not believable as a doctor! Don't waste your time!"
1,There Was So Much Potential for this Film.......,"I love David Duchovny, I love Angelina Jolie, but I hated this movie to the point I had trouble watching it to it's rather predictable conclusion.The story line was good but it is clear that the end product was not what the actors or the director was aiming for. I come to that conclusion from watching interviews with DD during his Press Junket for the movie.The feeling through out this movie was it was a higgldly piggldy mess, and no-one was quite sure how to reach the end. So it kind of waded through scenes that you were wondering where the rest of it went and how you reached this point in the first place.If there was a no star rating, I would have chosen that. As I said at the beginnin, I love David to death, but I felt I was watching Mulder without Scully in another version of his FBI life.On a final note, I am looking forward to his new movie with Minnie Driver."
2,Muddled,"What Hutton is doing in this is anyone's guess. I suspose he takes what's offered nowadays. Duchovny gets by on easy charm. His approach to acting may even be original, it's just hard to tell in the drive by shooting that is Hollywood film making. Actually, the bizarre humour of the second half rather won me over, but why America should want to habitually portray itself to the world as venal and indifferent to human suffering is one for 'The X-Files'."
3,Playing God,"This movie got an extra star only because I love David Duchovny. This really isn't a believable movie. For one thing, Duchovny a doctor? Okay, maybe if we saw him in scrubs or something it would be more believable.This movie raises too many questions than it answers.If you are going to watch this movie to kill sometime, maybe it's worth it. I have found that in my network of friends, either you love it and can't explain why or you hate it and can't explain why.My recommendation is this: rent it a few times before you buy. Make sure you really like this movie and can't explain why or else you may end up kicking yourself ..."
4,"An Enjoyable ""B""","While it isn't the most impressive movie, Playing God does have its moments. When I first saw it, I laughed out loud at a pairing of David Duchovney and Angelina Jolie, but after the third veiwing, the characters and the story began to grow on me. Duchovny and Jolie's chemistry actually works, and Timothy Hutton is crazy, colorful and quotable as a slightly sadistic crime lord. You'll get the gist of the story from previous reviews, but the important thing with this movie is to watch it tongue-in-cheek. It's entertaining, has a certain replay value, and has enough plot holes/unbelieveable happenings/goofy dialogue to warrent a double-play, and in my case, extensive nerd-ish study. What I've gleaned from the story and the character is basically: What goes around comes around. If you like enjoyable, well-meaning cheese, check this one out!"
4,Bloody and Vulgar but Otherwise Great,"This movie has definite re-watch-ability. The plot is tight; the acting is good; and the script is packed with great lines, well-delivered. It kept even my mother, the proverbial Mikey, alternately on the edge of her seat and shaking with laughter.A true must-see for any fan of Timothy Hutton, David Duchovny, Angelina Jolie, dark action/comedies, or narrated movies in general."
1,What was this supposed to be? Its one big mess!,"Honestly now , how can you like this movie? It has the most uneven low plot a movie could have. Thats what makes it so dumb. David Suchovny plays and LA surgeon who had his licence to practice medicene taken away. Timothy Hutton plays a big LA player who can help him get it back. But after the two bond they begin to fight over the same girl(Angelina Jolie). There is a lot of pointless dialogue and action sequences. The whole movie is just a big blur basically. Duchovny's satr power or the cool way the film tries to play cannot save the movie from being anything less than trash. I would definetly not reccomend this film to anyone. Listen for The Matrix theme in the film If yo sadly decide to see it."
1,no dvd in case!,The case came in great condition but there was NO DVD inside. please help! please send the DVD.
2,Playing God,"Weak movie. Sometimes, it seems to be okay, but other times, I can't get through it. I love David Duchovny, but this is one movie I don't think he should have made. It's almost as if this was the wrong role for him. And the movie didn't flow well. Maybe that was just due to bad editing. Don't recommend buying this one until you have rented it and are sure you like it."
2,Weak Script.Good Acting,"I only give Playing God 3 stars just because the acting is good,it's the only thing good about the movie.Very weak scirpt and bad editing.And when it came out I was so looking forward to seeing it because I love both David Duchovny and Angelina Jolie and I was really disappointed.Well we all know Angelina has come along way since this and Hackers and David should stick to more stuff like Return To Me.Overall,Playing God is worth to rent,but not to buy."
4,Escapist fun.,"Duchovny plays a drug addicted doctor who has lost his license. One night while making a score he saves a man's life and is suddenly back in the doctor business when a big time smuggler (Hutton) gets word of the rescue from his gal (Jolie) and sets him up as an underworld doc. Predictable characters, but good acting. A smarter brand of dark comedy than is usually found in an action adventure thriller."
5,Live and love speaks for itself,"No other reggae star makes me feel it like Mr. Paul does.Where he got his unique voice,no one knows.The title track,live and love is sweet and nice.Other tracks like Call Me and Be Mine tonight and i wanna love you all over just ushers into a romantic mood.Frankie also lures listeners into the dancehall mood with Style And Pattern and Long Run,Short Ketch.Definitely a bomber."
1,"Sent wrong book twice, you keep sending me a short pamphlet of case studies instead of the actual textbook.","I ordered this textbook, but you sent me the wrong item. I informed you of this, and I was sent the wrong item again.Bill Hancockhancock25@comcast.net25 Cow Hill RdKillingworth, CT06419860-452-4142"
5,Excellent,This is the first time I ever ordered something online. I was worried because of scams but with this company no problems at all. The book looks brand new no damage at all. The only problem I had was I didnt do express which is my fault. I rate this company five stars I will be ordering from them again.
1,Completely Bored,"I found this novel pedestrian, and after 56 pages I had to give up because nothing really happens and I just couldn't find anything about the characters to keep me going."
5,Specifications,"I thought I should comment on this item since so little information is given in the listing--I wondered if I was buying a ""pig in a poke"" when I ordered it. In short, this Leviton amplified antenna offers a significant improvement over a passive rabbit-ears antenna.To be more specific, information provided on the box is as follows:Frequency: 40-860 MhzGain: VHF 20dB, UHF 20dBGain Control: 30dBNoise Figure: 6dBPower Supply: 110 VACHope this helps,Richard"
4,Jenson Leviton 100-C5864 Amplified TV-FM Indoor Antenna,"I live in a remote area where I do not have access to cable, high speed and wireless internet. I have no other option than roof top or rabbit ears. Cannot afford satellite. I replaced my rabbit ears with this product and immediately noticed an improvement in reception. It was worth the money."
1,"Never have I payed for an item, been notified of empty stock, then not been reimbursed","I ordered this banner about a year ago, was notified that they were out of stock, yet I was still charged for the full price of the banner. Hope you don't get turned over like I did."
4,Winslow series,I am reading the series in order and this one is just as good as the others so far. Love the Gilbert Morris books.
3,ok,"while i enjoyed this book as a whole, i am unclear about lobo's feelings for lainie. his ex-lover is part of a gang that is holding lainie's sister for ransom. the first reference to angela and lobo's romance is when lobo thinks ""we were not in love, we used each other"". then after she dies, he thinks ""i loved her, did she still love me?"" then when lainie asks lobo if he still loved angela, he says they had a thing, but it didni""t amount to much. i also thought his grief over angela's death was excessive. it read more he had lost the love of his life. which is it?"
3,Ummm I only got ONE chew NOT 50 chews,"Yes the title is correct - the advertised item was for 50 chews and I received a large box with only one chew in it. Must say that Amazon.com customer service is the very best! When I didn't get a response from the seller after several days, Amazon refunded my money and let me keep the ONE lamb chew.As for the chew itself, my bigger dog kept it away from the smaller dog to chew it. He didn't finish it off like he does the rawhide chews. No way to know if he was saving it for a snack later or not since my smaller dog found it and finished it off.I will definitely keep ordering from Amazon - after over 3 years of being a customer and buying lots of things this is the first time I've ever had a problem. Thanks again to the prompt attention from the customer service team!"
1,False advertisment!!!!,"I purchased a 50 count of Lamb Chews and only got 1 Lamb Chew in the mail. Upsetting and their only excuse was oops the sale was a mistake, we didnt mean to sell the 50 count at that price."
5,Wrangler,I love the old west...and Marty Robbins always makes the west come alive with his ballads and trail songs. This is the C &W a lot of us grew up with.
4,"Not bad, but not entirely good either...","This game can be really slow paced unless your playing with a Digimon that has speed (like Renamon). This game pretty much plots Digimon from seasons 1-3 and pits them against them against each other in a melee type battle. What determines a win? When you hit a Digimon with certain attacks, they drop little balls called D-Spirits. The Digimon with the most D-Spirits at the end of a round wins. Simple, yet effective. However, once a round, Calumon will come around and the player that gets to him first evolves to Ultimate (or Mega). If your opponent gets to him first, better start running. I would recommend this game ONLY to Digimon fans who would be unable to purchase a Wonderswan Crystal and Digimon Battle Spirit 1.5 (a Battle Spirit game that is much better than this one that America never got)."
1,It's good---NOT,"This game has some of the worst graphics I have ever seen. There is NO plot, and gets really old, annoying and boring after a while. This is a one-time play beat too easy type of game. It not worth you hard earned time or money."
4,digimon,It is too easy. I played this before. killing the evil digimmon was easy. I got it along time ago. This game is now in the past. my name is Alec Fraser Simpson.
4,Excellent Recording Quality,Shostakovich's works must be paired with 1.) World's greatest symphony orchestra 2.) Outstanding recording. This CD has both. Good buy!
1,Waste of money,We bought these for our kids and neither of us were impressed. A complete waste of money and we would not buy again.
1,Not actually available...,"I haven't actually heard this CD at all. I ordered it back in November from Amazon. I waited and waited. Amazon kept sending order updates requesting that I e-mail back proof of my continuing interest in getting this elusive CD. I faithfully e-mailed back. Finally, in early March, I got an e-mail telling me that the CD was ""not available from any source."" This, in spite of the fact that 13 used copies are listed right on this page and the fact that Amazon itself is still offering the CD. I don't know what Amazon's game is but, if I were interested in actually obtaining this CD, I would look somewhere else. Barnes and Noble offers it for the same price and they say that they can send it in 3 to 5 days."
4,"Bike, walk or drive...","If you have hesitated to leave the Interstates on your trip along the NE corridor, then this book is invaluable. It provides exact routes winding through scenic countryside and towns, and also offers recommendations for eateries and unusual points of interest. The book is a great resource if you want to, say, bike from New York to Boston, but you aren't sure how to reduce your exposure to the 18-wheelers and other hazards of modern road travel. This is all presented in a portable and easily understood format, with maps and directions. One of my favorite routes is from New York to Baltimore, all taken on quiet roads. Even if you use this book for a single trip, it will pay for itself by rewarding you with charming towns, and some places that are pretty bland, but accompanied by rolling hills and splendid vistas around every turn."
1,The quality of the songs is excellent...but a waste of money if you already have the collection of CD's,Look....dont be just another fool parted with their hard earned money.....if you already have the cd's....of all the music THE BEATLES released.....you're either a chump...or your bankroll exceeds your common sense....I love THE BEATLES...but am sick of all the same material being duplicated to death....just anoth marketing hoax to keep the bucks flowing in
3,Too expensive!,"Listen I know that these singles are in the original mono and you get great artwork, but it's far too expensive for anyone with a normal income. I love The Beatles to death I have all their albums but I'm not spending over three hundred dollars on 44 songs and some art. If you want non album singles get the past masters vol 1&2 they are in stereo but they sound fine. Unless you have a big wallet or The Beatles are the only band you care about then get this collection but for those of us with other interests and bills to pay this is too much money."
2,Not Worth It for Me,"I picked this book up on sale, thinking to use it as a supplement to Shelby Foote's 'The Civil War - a Narrative'. My plan was to spice up Foote's already excellent narrative by looking up quotes in the Oxford book from the personalities in the chapter I happened to be reading in the Foote book. In this way I would get more insight into these persons.But this idea didn't work out well. Often the general I was inspired to find out more about in Foote's book had either no quotations at all in the Quotation Dictionary or the quotations that were there offered little insight into the person who said it.On the other hand, there were many interesting quotes by Lincoln, but not enough to make up for my disappointment about generals' quotations.Just my two-cents worth."
1,Banjo Instructional Video,"Waste of money--when the songs are played you are watching the guy playing the banjo but all you can hear is a guitar strumming. It's laughable. Unfortunately, that's not why I bought it."
1,Disgusted by the fake applause,"I transcribe Art Tatum's music, so it did not take me very long to find out that applause was electronically added to well known non-live and classic performances. I found this to be very offensive. Art Tatum is the greatest jazz pianist who ever lived and does not deserve to be a vehicle for such a digusting rip off. This practice if it exists anywhere else should be banned, unless the listener in warned. This might explain why there is virtually no documantation anywhere to go with the CD. Also it might answer the previous reviewer's question regarding the dates of these performances."
2,You can get these performances minus the applause,"To the best of my knowledge, Art Tatum only recorded ""Three Little Words"" once... it appears on THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS. I was excited to discover that he had apparently recorded it live as well, but having read previous reviews here, and noticing that the song titles mirrored those of THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS almost exactly, I decided to listen to the Real Audio extract of ""Three Little Words"" from this album. It is absolutely the same as performance as the one on THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS. Do yourself a favor -- buy THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS instead, and avoid the overdubbed applause."
2,Overdubbed Applause? Ridiculous!,"I knew I'd heard these versions before on other discs, but what a low blow to pass these off as LIVE recordings. It's pretty obvious that the audio levels between piano and audience aren't even close to matching. Not only that, but I don't think there was ever a club where Tatum would have permitted such rampant conversation during his entire performance. Either that, or the audience was the stupidest to ever congregate.It's a moot point to discuss Tatum on the disc; he's always been the best. But don't help line the pockets of whatever fat cat exec thought up this moronic concept."
3,Let's Dance !!!,"This disc is a compilation including remixes from the euro-dance band (artist) called Savage, best known for their mega-hit ""Don't Cry Tonight"".NOT to be confused with the NWOHM band Savage which released albums like ""Babylon"", ""Hyperactive"" and ""Xtreme Machine"". If you're looking for a ""best of"" from the metal group, grab their ""This Ain't No Fit Place"" disc."
3,"Very nice looking, but no power...","Very nice looking, but no power... Couldn't handle more than 2 other wagons... but eyes moving is a plus for kids.."
2,Ehhh,"This train is far too light to run nicely on a track. It has a specialized coupler that doesnt play nice with traditional train couplers so you can't really connect anything except other ""Thomas"" trains to it. If you don't own other ones then all you can chug is this one train, but being that it's so light in weight, you won't last long with it. Its so light the wheels just spin on the track at high speed and it easily is bumped off buy the slightest track disturbance. If you can take apart the train and tape a few nickels to the inside if the plastic housing it should add enough weight to make it better."
5,A great book to teach some basic Spanish vocabulary,"As a Spanish teacher in an elementary school, I use this book to help teach describing words. The children love how the elephant and giraffe make silly changes to their appearance; it holds their interest in the story and helps them learn the material. At the end of the story they clearly recognize the lesson: you don't need to change who you are because friends like you just the way you are!"
3,Good Book for Teaching French to Young Children,"Generally a good way to teach very young children French, although I'm not really crazy about the storyline. In the story, each animal is unhappy with its various attributes and wants other ones, i.e. my nose is too long, I want a shorter one, etc - not exactly the kind of message I'd want my toddler to absorb.Having said that, the illustrations are wonderful and the quality of the hardback book ............. is just great.Although there is a glossary and pronunciation guide, I would not recommend this book to a parent who does not have a rudimentary knowledge of French."
2,It's not a fabulous book.,"I think the book is fine for the French but when you are raising children, this book just talks about what these animals do not like about themselves. I do not want my child starting to talk like that. So, I'm just not in love with the book."
5,Quite good,This book is quite good. Much cheaper then buying it at the University.The inserts on stuff was very interesting and I would read it for fun. But then again I love Political Science
1,Big disappointment,"I agree with the reviewer who couldn't finish the book--also with the one who said there were too many characters. I found most of the characters boring, irrelevant, and I couldnt keep them straight nor did I care to. I have loved all the other Nina Reilly books and I missed the characters from Tahoe. Or perhaps I should say the characters as they were at Tahoe. Paul and Nina were indeed boring. Sandy was a different person altogether. Because I loved the other books so much, I was determined to finish this one. It became a chore. I ultimately skipped over a hundred pages and read the last ten or so. Didn't miss a thing, apparently. A real snoozer. My advice to the O'Shaugnessy sisters: Get back to Tahoe and put Nina back into her office!"
2,Poor presentation,"My wife recommrnded this book to me. I have a reading issue so I purchased this book on disk. I read about 1 book a week on disk on my way to and from work. This book was a struggle to listen to. The reader was boring, the chapters were said as a number rather than ""Chapter 4"" which became confusing. It became difficult to focus on the story.All in all, I put it down after listining to 2 disks. My wife is reading another book by the author."
2,Presumption of Death,I enjoyed all previous Perri O'Shaughnessy/Nina Reilly novels and had looked forward to Presumption of Death. I was disappointed to find the storyline disjointed and hard to follow with too many characters. I'm hoping the next Nina Reilly novel will follow the authors' previously successful formula.
1,A big disappointment,"I placed a preorder for this book as I have very much enjoyed all the previous ones by these authors. However this seemed completely different - turgid, boring. I found the characters too confusing, there waas little mystery and indeed little legal drama - many pages of complex subplot and descriptions of poison oak forest. Nina and Paul now both seem irritating and indeed irritated with each other.I didn't really complete it - got completely lost and baffled in the party scene and then skipped to the short courtroom sessions.I doubt if I will buy their next one - not without finding out if it is back on track."
1,Presumption of Death,"I have loved all the previous O,Shaughnessy books but this book is awful and I am so disappointed. I have read 2/3 of this book and still wonder what's going to happen. It is not written in the style of the two sister authors and is boring. I've decided not to waste my time reading the remainder of the book. What happened? The authors should keep Nina in Tahoe and not spend so much time describing her relationship with Paul. Keep to the mystery. My friends and I swap books and I cannot tell you how many are so disappointed in my review."
5,Ricardo Muti. 1997 New years Day Concert Vienna,I have just recieved this CD and although I ordered a DVD I shall keep this CD because it is very good and I shall be able to play it in my car
3,Lots of fancy designs,"We are building a victorian house, and I was looking for an affordable plaster design for above the stairway. This has many designs, all fancy and beyond my ability to replicate (or willingness to hire the work done). It does have many neat variations, and is a good resource for ideas."
1,Sharp Quality Way Down,"Buyer Beware - It might have been a lemon, but one month after the basic warranty expired in April 2004, the display on our Sharp microwave all but disappeared, making it very hard to use. Soon after, our Sharp microwave started to trip the circuit breaker. Some of the quick-cook selections are plain silly, unless you like the same few meals over-and-over. The noise from this microwave is terrible, too! And don't count on the effective capacity to be what is advertised. If you scan the consumer rating mags, you'll see a sharp (pun intended) drop in Sharp product reliability in recent years.We had a Quasar (Panasonic) microwave that performed without a glitch for over twenty years until 2003. We think you're going to be really disappointed with a Sharp microwave that probably works only one year."
4,"Sharp R320HQ microwave, bisque colored...","We ordered this microwave online because no one locally carried the Bisque color, and the price was better than if we ordered it from local vendors. Our old one died and we needed the bisque color to match our cabinets and appliances, which are all the bisque color. The only complaint I have about it is that the door is very loud when closing...has a real tinny, unpleasant sound. Not solid sounding. That's the only complaint about it that we have."
4,New Sharp Microwave,There are a few new features on the microwave that were not on our ll year old one. It is great to not have to turn over potatoes for baked potatoes. I am having trouble adjusting to more intense heat...keep lowering the power for heating things and sometimes they still heat too quickly. I miss the recipe booklet. Over all I am satisfied with it.
1,Broke after 2 years,"After only two years, the buttons failed. This microwave is totally useless, since I can't turn it on."
3,Disappointed,"I did enjoy the product for a year and six weeks - when I started using the sensors the product stopped working within 15 minutes. I had not used the sensors until that time. The top of the microwave got red hot and just would not work anymore. There sat my dinner guests waiting. I had bragged about how delicious the meats are when cooked in a microwave. So I had them for dinner. $100 dollars down the drain. I purchased it from Amazon - now Amazon wants more than $143 for this microwave. I know it's Sharp's responsibility, they have to make a better product and give a longer warranty than a year."
2,Sharp Microwave,"Looks OK, but made cheaply. Noisy while running and makes a loud noise when closing the door. I would not recommend it."
2,Turntable did not work.,"The microwave was defective. Fortunately, Amazon agreed to take it back with full refund. I am definitely switching brands on my next purchase."
5,I love this microwave!,"I love using this microwave. It has several time-saving features and food comes out beautifully cooked. The only negative is that the door is light weight and sounds a bit tinny when you close it. For the price, this is a great product."
3,Needs improvement,"This is the second Sharp 1500 Watt Microwave we have owned. We purchased the second soon after first one developed problems after 8 years of satisfactory use. The new one seemed to be basically the same except for the extremely loud noise generated when the door is either closed or opened. I have hearing aids and do not appreciate the noise which sounds like a large tin box being dropped. Our earlier unit opened by pulling on the door. To open this one you have to push on a large lever which pops the door open. The mechanism is so stiff that the act of opening the door usually slides the oven across the counter into the backsplash. This is not an expensive unit but I think they could have done a little better on sound control.Sharp R-320HK 1200-Watt 1.2-Cubic-Foot Microwave, Black"
5,Awesome Value!,"My family of four has lived with a microwave half this oven's size with much less power and no buttons. How amazing to upgrade for so little money and have not only a much bigger and powerful oven, but also all of the features that make reheating and cooking a snap! I wish I had upgraded a long time ago."
5,A sampler of great stories,"Well, yes, a strong case could be made that these stories represent the Best of Rumpole, although Rumpolemaniacs must argue for a few omitted cases, but, great as these stories are - and they are engaging, clever, funny, satisfying - I don't know what the purpose of this sampler is meant to be. To introduce Rumpole to a prospective reader I would start with The First Rumpole Omnibus. It addds much to the pleasure of reading Rumpole to get to know him as he develops over the course of the original stories. On the other hand, this makes a terrific airplane or travel read, even for those who've read them all before (Rumpole is one of those characters that not only holds up well read after read but actually improves with familiarity)."
3,Lonesome sailing,"This book has some claim to its title as ""the first and best of spy stories"" (as The Times of London called it), but more because of the real-life political and military activities of its author than for its intrinsic qualities as a novel. What Childers clearly loves most is sailing. Although there is an espionage element thrown in to give it direction, this is really a very fine yachtsman's yarn, as detailed in its maritime technicalities as a Forsyth or a Clancy would be in their military ones. Lovers of John Buchan should enjoy this too; Childers' influence on the younger writer is obvious, though his style is perhaps a little stilted. But it keeps one reading, and the atmosphere of the desolate tidal flats behind the Friesian Islands is conjured to perfection."
2,Very very slow,"I was interested in this book because I do have an interest in a good spy story and sail boats and sailing but little knowledge of the latter.Having already professed my lack of knowledge of boats and sailing,this book was way over my head in that regard.I just was'nt able to appreciate the involved describtions of that part of the book which was the overwhelming majority of the book.The spy story made up a very small part and in my opinion was only included to justify writing basically a book about the perils of sailing a small boat along a coastline.Reilly:Ace of Spies this book isn't.I gave it two stars for the simple reason of the effort it must have taken to write it.I can't say I hated it,but I surely did'nt like it either.This fellow should have read some of Henty's books before writing this one.It took alot of willpower to plod through it."
1,where is the story?,"I am not a sailor, nor am i interested in the details of sailing. Also the description of the east frisian coast (i was born there) didn't fascinate me. But the worst part is the lack of a plot, i mean it can be summarized in less than a sentence, very disappointing but not surprising if one knows why the book was written. To me, reading this book was a waste of time."
1,Bubble gum reading with that is hard to chew.,"I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat. The ending left me empty and unsatisfied. If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area. Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map."
3,Somewhat mellow after all the expectations.,"I expected this to be a great read after all the hype I have heard of this book. Alas it was not so, so maybe Childers will haunt me after this review. This book, like much of the narrative has me sailing in circles. I got some nautical terms out of this reading but not much else. The plot is the German Imperial Army planning the conquest of England. They expand their tranportation system in the land nearest the UK and build train stations and barges as a means to transport their soldiers.This story is perhaps more believeable than a James Bond movie. However, the narrative at page 200, is much like that at the beginning. This is an OK read for spy buffs, and those interested in WWI."
2,Dull,"This story moves at a very slow pace. The first hundred pages are just the two main characters out on a yachting trip. To call this story a ""thriller"" or ""spy"" novel is a stretch I'd call a lie by today's standards. It's about 280-300 pages of building not very tense tension and then finally at the end of the book you get a none thrilling conclusion. The only redeeming factor of this book, the reason why I gave it two stars and not one, is the dynamic between the two main characters. The characters are engaging but the plot is so dull I must recommend readers to stay away. DON'T READ."
1,Not worth the money,"A beautiful looking cookbook, certainly. I was very excited to try the recipes after receiving the book for Xmas. But what a disappointment. Tried 14 different recipes with fellow baking friends over the course of a week. They weren't bad, but we six bakers let out collective ""ho-hums"" with each."
3,to the reader who wished they never met Nick,"Don't take Nick Malgieri and his bad behavior personally. He is a miserable human being and everybody in the industry knows this about him. You were not the first and certainly not the last to be dissed by him. However, being a former professional student of his, I can tell you that he really knows his stuff and his recipes are great. I graduated his cooking school with high honors, yet he made me and my classmates feel like complete imbeciles during the time he personally instructed us. Ironically that was the ""cookie"" part of our petit four training.So take heart in the fact that you are not alone and actually among the numbers of many professionals who suffered the same experienced. His recipes are great - so get back at him by using them! And if we all send him a little prayer every time we do, perhaps he will become a little kinder, which i'm sure will drive him crazy!"
3,"good, not great","I tried several recipes from the book and was a little disappointed. They tasted good, but not great. The variety in the book is great, and the recipes are well laid out and easy to follow. But so far I'm going to stick to foodnetwork.com for cookie recipes."
1,How the Cookie Crumbles,"I was so relieved to see that other bakers were disappointed with this book. The recipes SEEM as if they'd be good, but they're so disappointing, and the directions were overly confusing. I was once a professional baker and I found this book a big ol' waste of my money. The little guide to cookies has better recipes for much less dough."
1,uhhh...,"this is one of the worst books I've ever purchased...One Christmas i used several recipes from ""cookies unlimited""...all turned out inedible....I don't just mean they were a little disappointing...but rather disgusting and terrible...even my dog wouldn't eat one....alas...it has a new home.....at goodwill..."
2,There are better books....,"When I first purchase this book I was so excited tot ry many of the different recipes... but like many others I found them lacking. They never seemed to turn out like the ones displayed in the book, and I am an experienced baker! However I did discover a few new favorites in the book, after I tweaked the ingredients a little. I constantly get requests for my version of ANZAC biscuits (a cookie you can find in many other places!)."
1,His recipes just don't work,"This guy may be a feted author/chef/whatever but none of his recipes (the ones I have tried anyway) work. I have a couple of his books (cake and cookie) and I intend to chuck them out. I bake quite frequently and get it right 99% of the time including recipes from Martha Stewart, Susan Purdy, Doris Greenspan, Jim Foley...I can go on. Have never bothered writing a review before but everyone, please don't buy his books. And he sounds like a real prima donna."
5,"Lots of variety, great read, good cookies","I've tried several of the recipes in this book, and most of them were very successful. A couple of the recipes were too sweet for my family's taste, but I made the chocolate chip cookies for my husband's office around the holidays, and two people said they were, hands down, the best chocolate chip cookies they'd ever had.The book is divided into cookie category sections (e.g., refrigerator, drop, bars, etc.) and there are many, many recipes with interesting backgrounds on all of them. There's also a great reference section in the back for ordering specialty items, cookie presses, and other things you might not find locally (although most of the recipes can be made with everyday ingredients & equipment).Overall, I think this is a wonderful cookbook and it's by far the best cookie book I've ever used. I turn to it again and again not only when I'm planning on making cookies, but when I just want to read about them and drool over the pictures, too."
2,Disappointing...,"I had high hopes for this book and was impressed by the variety of recipes it contained. However, the four recipes I've tried so far have been disappointing: Jan Hagels (Dutch slice-and-bake almond cookie), icebox chocolate chip cookies, sour cream drops and the gingersnaps (not very flavorful). I wouldn't make any of them again."
4,Educational,We have used these flash cards with my daughter who is 5. They are durable and she enjoys them.We will be purchasing the multiplication and division cards soon.
4,The lower dose seems to help,"After reading an article about melatonin, and how our brains lose melatonin as we age, I decided to try it. The research pointed out that 0.5 mg is as effective as 3 - 5pm, I picked up a bottle of 1 mg Melatonin by Source Naturals at my local health food store. I have been splitting the tablets in half and taking it about an hour before bedtime. The first time I slept so well that I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in...no pillows thrown about, no covers tossed aside. The bed was still perfectly made and I awoke lying on my back, ten hours later. Amazing. Since then I have been taking the same dose every night with results not quite as stunning as that, but it does seem to help get me into a more ready to fall asleep mode."
1,Read this and know suffering.,"This book is utterly awful. The narrative changes from first to third person and back again for no apparent reason. None of the characters are believable and their actions make no sense. The plot goes in all sorts of bizarre directions, both to accomodate a clumsy interpretation of Revelation and also a seemingly random collection of photographs (a crowd of people waving brooms, a holiday snapshot near a big bell in Moscow - not terribly apocalyptic). As a novel, it wobbles between tedious and unintentionally funny. As a piece of religious propaganda, it's a complete failure."
2,"Okay story, but writing style sophomoric","Mr. Kirban has written an intersting story, but his writing style is so poor, it is distracting. As one reviewer pointed out, he switches grom first person to third person. What he didn't tell you is Mr. Kirban actually got so confused he began switching back and forth between the two, sometimes in the same paragraph. To his credit, I will say that some of his ""prediction"" about modern life were dead-on. You see, the book came out in 1970, but takes place in the year 2000. Mr. Kirban has space shuttles, laser weapons, as well as human cloning taking place."
2,This book is quite dogmatic!,"While this book is not as bad as Ernest Angely's RAPTURED, it is nonetheless very dogmatic.Kirban, like Angely, Hal Lindsey, et al. believes that the dispensational, premillennial view of the Second Coming is the ONLY CORRECT position to take. Kirban is also quite dogmatic on the issue of Christian rock music and Christian rock bands. He sees them as part of the great ""End Times"" apostasy. That is, anyone who is a contemporary Christian music artist is actually an apostate, according to Kirban.Another odd thing about this book, the narrative suddenly changes from first person as told by George to third person with George being spoken of along with the other characters.Finally, the end of the story as Christ returning to Earth riding astride a literal horse along with His disciples, including those ""caught up"" in the ""Rapture"" all riding on literal horses! Kirban undoubtedly interprets Revelation 19 quite literally!Intellectually weak like all the rest of this genre!"
5,"As a life long fan, the greatest book I've read.","I have been a tarheel fan for my whole life, I met ""THE MAN"" as a kid. He is just as portrayed in the book. This was a book that I could not put down. The best book I've read. Great work Art."
1,Stay Away From This!,"This is the worst piece of trash that I have ever seen pawned off as a vacuum! Uniformly, I have found that bagless vacuums work at about 1/5th of the capacity of bag vacuums. This cheap piece of garbage is poorly fitted and constructed, cheaply made, has no suction, and in every way is difficult to use. This went to Goodwill one week after I bought it. I didn't even feel like expending the time, money or energy to ship it back to the store in New York that it originated at."
1,"Very, very poor technical quality.","This is the poorest technical quality release I have ever heard. You can hear two men murmuring and talking through the first tracks. Until this work is remastered and this objectionable trait is removed, I would steer well clear of it!"
3,Classic La Traviata,"While it is a good live recording of La Traviata with Maria Callas, it was made in the 1950's and has been processed too many times.There should be more modern and higher fidelity recordings available."
2,"awful sound, callas showing decline","Callas is beginning to show serious vocal problem here. And I'm not a fan of Alfredo Kraus. To add to all that, the sound is unacceptable.This only deserve 2 stars because Callas is here, without it, it would be worthless. The five star Traviata is hands down the fab performance of the underrated Cotrubas/Domingo/Milnes recording. That is what Traviata is all about. Cotrubas sings the best sempre libera around, even better than that overrated singer from Australia, and far better than La Divina at this point of her career."
5,Absolutely beautiful,"This Traviata is not only wonderfully sung but also in great sound. Callas, Kraus and Sereni are in top form. One of the best Traviatas around, I love it!!!!!"
2,AVOID THIS REMASTERING OF SUBLIME RECORDING,"This is the awful 1997 EMI remastering of the 1958 live Lisbon performance. Please avoid this, see Amazon's listing of the rare out-of-print 1987 CD, available from 'other sellers'. The fascinating source, courtesy of Dr Robert Seletsky: The tape was copied from the original, right after the Lisbon perforrmance, and given to the tenor Kraus, who gave it to a record producer, who issued it on LP in the 1970s and later sold it to EMI, who issued it on LPs, Angel and EMI, in 1980 -'transferred nicely by EMI in 1987, but ruined in the dreadful 1997 remastering'."
1,Item shipped does not match picture!,"We ordered this item from ""Quality Deals"". The picture clearly shows the hole in the middle (which matches our outlets). The ones that arrived have a hole at the top and bottom, which would (A) require us to drill holes in our drywall and (B) not be nearly as secure as screwing them into the plate (I suspect that the action of pushing the slider piece over will eventually loosen it anyway).Bottom line -- do not order this item from ""Quality Deals"". I've submitted a request for a return, hopefully they'll do the right thing and take it back."
3,Babyproofed the house....and also parentproofed it.,"So these covers work great -- my intrepid toddler can't get them to budge, and has ignored all of the outlets since she discovered that it's futile to try. That being said, we can't plug in anything to the outlets that are covered with these plates, because the plugs won't stay in place (the little cover that makes sure baby is safe also makes sure that the plugs move a wee bit out of the socket, so nothing works). That being said, it definitely does its job of making outlets babysafe. They're also parent-and-grandparent-safe too!"
5,easy and effective!,"I always read the reviews before purchasing products on Amazon and I have to agree with the majority on this one - these are easy to install and effective! MUCH easier to actually use the outlets when we need to vs. trying to get a finger under those cheap plastic inserts. I don't have nails so I always had to use something to pry them off, which is not safe! And the springs used for the sliding covers are strong so I don't worry about my 1 yr old pushing them up. Great product! I am ordering more!"
1,basically unusable,"I wanted to love these outlet covers, so much so that I optimistically bought 20 of them, but I'm seriously disappointed with them. They are easy to install and look good, but because they have the sliding panel that moves in front of the outlet, it adds enough additional material that standard plugs can't reach all the way into the outlet. The plugs reach in partially, but the plastic slide pressuring against them causes them to pop right back out."
5,They work perfectly for my 1 year old,"I was using those little plug in things but he has made it his mission in life to pick them all out. I purchased one of these, screwed it in and waited....... Within 2 minutes he was over there checking out the new goods. Ha! he is walking away. Ha! I win. Ordering 2 more.Edit: He is now 18 months and I have installed these in every room of my house."
5,solid construction and little finger proof,"My 8 month old daughter just ""tested"" one of these plates for us and they came through with flying colors. the plates themselves are a sturdy plastic and come with a longer screw so you can (although the manufacturer doesn't recommend it necessarily) put the plate over your existing plate. We had a couple of outlet covers that were painted onto the wall and all the exacto knives in the world couldn't have gotten them off, so being able to cover the existing outlet plate and still have it work, was great."
3,Descent Outlet Covers,"I bought two of these covers for the outlets I use on a weekly basis (where I plug in my vacuum). They were extremely easy to install and I could barely notice the difference between these plates and my old ones. One note, for one of the plates, it is slow to slide back into position, because of that I gave the product three stars. Great idea, but cheap construction."
4,Does the trick,"Buy these, not the ""safety first"" ones from BrUs. These are about ~1/8""?? thinner (so not as bulky) and the screws are long enough that you can actually screw them in to the wall (unlike the other brand, in which the screw is way too short). Note: they only have 1 screw in the center, so not right for you if your outlets have a top & bottom screw. Only negative is I think they are bit expensive for what it is (a piece of plastic with 2 small sliding covers)."
1,Smaller than Standard Covers,"These are a bit narrower than a standard cover. They don't quite cover the holes in my wall and my 1 year old can stick his finger in the hole. Very unsafe! If they say standard size, they should be standard size, not smaller."
2,Can't use the outlet once these are installed,"This outlet cover is great if you never plan on using the outlet. It keeps my son from sticking his finger in the socket, but the cover sticks out too far from the outlet and the plugs cannot make contact with the socket. It has been very frustrating.They're big and bulky but I found the box-type covers more useful then these. Its also been easier just to move furniture in front of plugs where practical."
2,"like the product, hate the price","This price is a LOT for something that youll have to buy many of!!!! this comes with just one, and if you multiply the price by the amount outlets you have, youll be spending a lot of money. I do however recommed these,"
4,Good outlet cover,"I like the design of this outlet cover that replaces a standard outlet plate. I think what's better about this product over the plastic plug-ins that you insert into the plug is that if there is something plugged in, and a toddler unplugs it, this snaps shut so the outlet is protected. You can never have an open outlet using this outlet cover, and you never have to pry out one of those plastic plugs. We've had a couple different brands of these, and this one seems to be a little more cheaply made (plastic bends more easily at the screw, slides are looser), but it still works just as well."
3,Doesn't fit,"The cover doesn't fit and the product did not come with screws. Luckily, I only ordered a few plates after having read that size can be a problem. I would advise to order one and see how it fits before investing in a bunch."
5,Love these!,After trying multiple types of individual outlet plugs we decided to order one of these Safe Plate covers for the most used outlet in each room. I'm so glad we did! I get to give my fingernails a break from trying to pry out the other plugs! These work so well... You just slide the covered portion to the right as you plug in your appliance. My little one hasn't even come close to figuring them out.So happy with these!
5,size and screw,one person posted that you need a new screw size as the plate is thicker than standard - this is true but mine came with the longer screw.
5,Easy to Install. Best Baby Proofer.,Highly recommend over the standard outlet covers (the ones you press into each outlet). Easy to install and they look good too!
4,Concert Version of an Opera,"I've only had the opportunity to watch the first part. I have recently gotten a 1080i 42"" LCD TV with 5.1 sound system and appreciated the 16X9 format. I thought the opening chorus was too slow even though Koopman is supposed to be a Baroque expert. His guestures were a bit excessive for my taste as well. Tempos later in the piece seemed better chosen. I have an excellant audio only version on LP by N. Harn... which contains an excellant structural analysis of the piece. The booklet with this production could have done better in that regard."
2,Interesting Account of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,"I like Justin Green's stuff. ""Binky Brown Makes Up His Own Puberty Rites"" is an excellent example of adolescent anguish. Also, I grew up Catholic just like the author. So I eagerly read this book. A big disappointment. This is not a story of adolescent anguish, or Catholic guilt, or rebelling against moral authority, or anything else one can identify with. It is an account of the progress of a psyvhiatric disorder. If the author were Jewish, or Bible Christian, or communist in his upbringing, the symbolism used would have been different. But still, this is an inner, medical disturbance, not an artistic struggle.Not a search for religious identity. Not something I can identify with."
4,A very good book,"This is a very good book, written by a GM who has played the defence for years. Compared to Aagaard's work on the Sveshnikov, Yakovich provides more variations and obviously knows a great deal more about this variation of the Sicilian than does Aagaard. On the other hand the latter does a better job explaining basic ideas for white and black.Excellent books on openings use that opening as a medium to teach about chess in general. The Sveshnikov variation is a fascinating learning tool because of the tension between pawn-structure and dynamic piece-play. Yakovich does not discuss this much and four stars is therefore enough.If you are a medium rated player (above at least 1800) who have not played this variation before - buy Aagard first, then Yakovich."
2,"Valuable, but Skewed","I'm not going to say it's a bad book. There are very few books that draw together so many fine and seminal pieces of literature and play them against one another so well. It's a fine book.There are, however, features of the book which are just maddening. Did ancient religious scholars stop to question the historicity of Genesis 1-3? No, out of enlightened self-interest (and a strong wish to avoid being executed as an apostate) they did not. As the modern inheritors of that legacy, we are not quite so bound up in the literal. I think the editors, all very capible, might have included more material from the mythological, metaphysical, and allegorical readings of creation and fall.It is an exceptional book as it is--but it could be a real masterwork if some slightly more heretical material were included."
2,Good story but didn't keep my interest,"I found this book alternately interesting and boring. The stream of conscious narrative was an interesting perspective on the mind of a young boy. Overall, though, I wasn't engaged by the story, which didn't seem to go anywhere, nor by the inner life of the boy, which was too undeveloped to draw me in.Probably best for people deeply interested in New York or Jewish immigrant life at the turn of the century."
1,"""one bad thing after another happening to a pathetic little victim,"" would have been a better title.","I certainly couldn't top the review by A. Ross posted on this site. He hits all the points that make this such a ridiculously bad book. The syrupy, drippy, silly, overwrought, over-the-top, overly melodramatic, bad writing in this book is laughable at times. And it goes on and on and on, tediously pretentious for a mind numbing 440 pages or so. The young protagonist is one of the most annoying characters i have ever experienced in a novel. in fact, there is almost nothing I liked about this gigantic bore of a book. of the 2000 books i have read, i would put this in my 10 worst category."
5,Extraordinary work of art,"This sad, wonderfully written book of tormented immigrants at he turn of the last century from the eyes of an 8 year old child, is vivid and painful. A portrayal of the growth of a youngster, and the gradual revelation of the source of his pain is not easy reading. Roth's power of description of people and scenes are like verbal photographs. This is a work of art."
5,American modernist masterpiece,"Mandatory reading for anyone who can read. Roth belongs alongside Faulkner, Dos Passos, and Joyce. Call it Sleep is the most beautifully written book I have ever read. Tight, turbulent, and heartbreakingly gorgeous. The author squeezes poetry from the tiniest, grittiest of experiences; the reader is allowed so far inside the head of David Shearl it is almost as if he or she travels the same intimate, painful path to awakening-an awakening at once political, sexual, and religious."
3,One baritone + one piano = underfed Mahler,"Hampson uses his considerable powers to inflate these piano renditions of Mahelr song cycles into something better than they are. One piano is not remotely adequate to represent Mahler's wonderfuly rich orchestral world, and Hampson overworks to compensate. A miss by a great singer."
3,Limited,"This book does have some good information in it, but it is pretty limited in scope. There are a handful of drills for linemen, a handful for running backs, a handful for quarterbacks, etc. It's not a comprehensive training or practice manual by any means. Also, I did not find any continuity to the way the drills were presented; they are dumped here in one big chunk, for the reader to glean what nuggets he or she can find. Most of the drills involve a full squad with equipment; if you're working with a short squad or looking for off-season drills without pads and tackling dummies, there's not a lot in here for you.It's a suitable book on the subject but I sure wish there was more here."
5,Interesting Stuff,"You should know that this book is not a glossy guide to ""House MD."" But if you're looking to enhance your knowledge of some of the medicine in the show, it's a great read. It also addresses how Greg House might fare in the real world."
2,Not the book I expected.,"I had high hopes for this book when I saw the writeup on Amazon. And was I disappointed. Gotta agree with the person who says this is opportunistic. It's basically a rehash of a dozen POTWs (Patient of the Week) and nothing new.If you want a better feel for how Dr. House might do it, check this book out. The first chapter reads like a House episodeHow Doctors Think"
3,Medical Science of House M.D.,The book gives an insight into the medical science behind the show. I would recomend it to any one who is interested in the show. However just like the show the book dosen't always protrey the clinical setting that doctors and nurses work in every day.
3,Coins get stuck on top of the tubes,"I own two coin counters. I bought a cheapo one for $12 and it worked great. I thought this one looked better (and it does) and would perform more coins at a time (it does too).The only problem is the coins get jammed at the top of the tubes a lot. While my cheapo one rarely got stuck on the top except when it was full. Not worth the price difference.Otherwise, it performs well."
2,Not so great for the money,"I use this all the time and it jams up rather frequently. The drawer that holds the coin wrappers will slide out from the vibration of the machine causing the coins to fall inside the machine. While it serves it's purpose, I would rather not pay that much for it."
3,Sorts well but does not fit standard coin rollers,"I bought this coin sorter because I have had a piggy bank for years that is finally full. At first I was happy with it, because it sorted acurately and didn't jam up unless I wasn't paying attention and the tubes were all full. But once I ran out of the tubes that come free with it, I was much less happy. I got the coin rollers that you can get free at the bank, but because they are flat and not pre-sealed at the bottom, they don't fit in the machine. So now I have to use the machine to sort and count the coins, but then I have to manually put them into the rollers, which I don't like since part of the reason I bought this machine was that it is supposed to roll them for you."
2,Worked for less than a year,"Worked well but then coins started getting jammed under the sliding drawer when it gets full. Eventually it wouldn't close properly and not line up correctly. If they made it out of metal instead of cheap plastic, it probably would of lasted longer."
2,Truly for Small Amounts of Change,"It says it on the packaging and you should believe it! This coin sorter is for small amounts...very small. I dumped a handful of quarters in there right when I got it and it immediately jammed. The moter fried up right away and it hasn't worked since day one. I can sort a small handful of coins by myself, but anything more than a handful would sure be easier with a properly functioning coin sorter.It's also very loud! Don't try to sort coin while the baby is sleeping. Spend a little more if you want it to last more than one day. I can't help think of all the coin I wasted on this purchase."
1,I won't recommend purchasing this.,I won't be recommending this item. I put it together but it keeps getting stuck and finally it jammed up and now it doesn't work.I wasn't able to fill not even one tube with it because it keeps jamming up.
1,Ultra Sorter Motorized Coin sorter,Horrible product. Does not sort coins properly (quarters and nickels mixed together). You don't know when you have the proper amount in each coin sleeve. Would not recommend!
4,So Far So Good,Not being used on a large scale but haven't had any problems with coins not being sorted or getting hung up. Seems to work just fine.
1,Piece of Junk,"I dont know what grade of plastic this is made of, but it came very well packed, but also came in about 10 pieces. It was easy enough to send back, but I found about the same thing, made a little more robust at Wal Mart for a cheaper price."
2,smooth operation?,"The coin bank does not work as smoothly as I would like. Msny times coins do not go into the proper tube, despite my not overfeeding the machine."
1,Piece of Crap,"This is the worst product. I just got it in the mail and I put the batteries in and followed directions. I stopped the motor to empty out a tube and when I went to start it again the thing won't go. It just quit working. The switch probably doesn't work. I tried changing the new batteries I just put in. That's not the problem. I have no clue why it won't turn on. Now I have to go through the painful procedure of returning it which means a haul to the post office, repacking it up, etc etc."
3,Very good for the Price,This product was good for the money. I've wrapped about two hundred dollars in coins so far without a problem. I'm glad I didn't spend the extra fifty bucks on a more expensive model.
4,Beatles Ep Boxset,"The sound was much better, brighter and leaped out of the speakers, more than I expected and the printing reproduction on each CD cardboard cover was spot on with great attention to detail. I was however surprised that the cardboard opening was at the top of each CD cardboard container rather than the side as per the original 7 inch record, a nice touch also would have been a plastic cover for each CD."
2,Dated Material,"I picked this up upon recommendation of my father. I found the material to be dated and I was unable to grasp the themes in any of the songs. Granted this is not as dated as the Bix Biederbecke or Guy Lombardo albums my grandfather recommended but antiquated nonetheless. I do not recommend this for anyone in their twenties, thirties or younger. You may find yourself bewildered and lost. This certainly is a product of a very strange generation."
4,PRODUCT REVIEW!,"I think that the book delivered exactly what I was anticipating. The four stories were correct and went back to the beginning so that a new reader would know what has happened in each of the four stories. When a new reader picks up a new issue of one of these stories he or she, will know the origins. Buy It!"
2,misinformation abounds,"This book supposedly has the origin of Savage Dragon which interests me. The rest of the properties don't really do anything for me, but I think mr. Q Public needs to do more research before he speaks about something. There are only 4 founding artists on this book: Larsen, McFarlane, Silvestri,and Valentino. There were only 7 original founders in total. Regardless of which of these you were going for, it's a 10th Anniversary book by founding artists. It is not 10 founding artists on an anniversary book. I would hope that one would work on their own literacy before speaking of literary respectability..."
2,This Sheik fantasy needs work! (D- Grade),"The overall plot of this story is a man who won't take no for an answer and the so called strong willed woman who falls in love with him anyway. Kalid Shah, a ruler in some mideastern country sees American Sarah and decides he wants her for himself. He kidnaps hers, threatens to beat his servants if she doesn't do what he says and constantly tries to seduce her. This fluffy story is not even a good fantasy. The reader will not understand even after Sarah escapes, why she would have any feelings for the hero. Even up to the last page he is obsessed to the point of madness.The love scenes are so-so and not even the secondary romance had enough power to make this book interesting. Skip this one.Katiebabs"
2,They Are Okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,"Personally, I don't care for Salt & Vinegar chips, but my spouse loves them. However, he did not love these. He has tried the most expensive brand and the least expensive brand. He gives PotatoFingers Salt & Vinegar Chips two stars and one star is simply for how fast they were delivered."
1,Extremely Poor Print Quality,"Do not buy this version of the book. The print quality is horrible. The book itself is fine, it's just that whoever did the printing did a lousy job."
5,"Fun, Calorie-burning Routine","This DVD is great fun. You won't get the routine down the first time, but don't worry, you'll get it after a few times and that's what keeps it from getting boring. Kari has a great style, she doesn't make you feel like you're the ugly duckling in a pond of models, if you know what I mean. Her cueing could be better in some spots, but overall all it's good. Especially once you get used to the routine. The music is generic upbeat music, so if you don't like exercising to stuff you hear on the radio, you don't have to worry about that.The DVD is a 55 minute all step workout (55 minutes includes the warm up and cool down). It has a menu at the front, so if you only want to do a 25 or 30 minute routine, just pick the menu option you want. The only equipment necessary is an aerobic step.I am very happy with this DVD, it has quickly become one of my favorites."
2,Not So Hot Steps,"Don't be fooled by the title. If you're looking for a classic step aerobics workout, keep looking. I'm a former aerobics instructor and a practiced stepper so I'm not easily discouraged by complex routines. It's not that this workout is difficult, but Kari's background is in dance, and this workout is evidence of that. Here it seems she's more concerned with displaying her dance ability than her step ability. It plays more like a dance routine and Kari uses the step as a prop. There's very little actual stepping going on, but there is a whole lot of ponying up and down, knee hopping turns around the step and just plain razzle-dazzle that tries to make up for substance. She's no Gin Miller."
3,Hot steps,"Kari's video is good, but you need more room than my living room will allow for all the fancy steps. If you have space and no carpet, then this is the one for you."
2,Not her best.,"I love Kari Anderson. Hot Steps as compared to her other videos should have been called HOT MESS. I actually gave two stars just because it's Kari and her cueing is the best. Too much twirling and dancing. (Yeah, I know that's why it's called HOT STEPS). I didn't consider this a step workout because of the dance moves. I felt like I spent more time not trying to fall on my butt than I did exercising."
4,Not for beginners,There's nothing wrong with the Kari's workout. Its just that it's super difficult and you have to really put aside some times to memorize the routine. She does some crazy moves and the only problem is that she doesn't use the steps as much as I like.
3,"Fast-moving, solid workout","This is one of my favorite workouts because it is a challenging routine which moves quickly and can be done in a 35 minute section from the menu. Overall, it has too many rapid twists and turns for me, but most of the movements can be easily modified to do without them. Some of the movements in the cool down seem a bit awkward and I prefer the cooldowns on some other of Kari's videos over this one."
2,Not the poem,"I ordered the book with ISBN 0822205947 thinking I was ordering the epic poem by Stephen Benet. This book is NOT the poem, rather a play based on that poem.I haven't read the play. It may be good, but I am irritated at being mislead into buying something other than what I thought I was buying."
3,Cheap tent,"This is a nice cheap tent. It was worth what I paid, but no more. It can only be set up where you have soil for the tent pegs. It won't stand on it's own. The roof is almost all mesh, so it should have been listed for warm weather use. The fly is conveniently sewed on one side, but it must be staked to secure it."
3,"Brings back good memories, but not much else","Overall:If you are a fan of the series you will enjoy it. Otherwise stay away.(well, if you're reading this review you must have some interest anyway.)I would give it 4 stars considering how glad I was to find this, but the price is a bit too steep for only 2 episodes.Detail:This is a straight import of a 1993 Japanese OVA release ""Time Bokan Oudoufukko"".The first episode is a car(mecha) race between various incarnations of the 3 bad guys. The 2nd episode's focus is on the trio from Yattaman (read:Doronjo), with various cameos from other animes of Tatsunoko production.Pros:You will see your favorite characters from time bokan series.Cons:This DVD has only 2 30-minute episodes, and of course these are not original ones.I wish Time Bokan series received better treatment -- A box set of the original TV series would be nice.(However, there are hundreds of episodes -- so that's not very likely.)"
4,"Good, but could be more durable","Overall, a good product and a good idea. Allows concealed carry of a firearm and wallet, etc without being too conspicuous, especially in the warmer months when shorts make concealment more difficult. Different sizes accomodate varying needs.One improvement I would make is to make the item a bit more durable. I've owened a few of these and note two repetitive problems: 1)the zippers break after one to three years and 2) The stitching could be more substantial.On the whole, a decent unit. I'd pay an extra $10 or so for greater durability, however."
5,It's Great!,"I love this CD. It is moving and expansive. If you like Bach, I don't think you can go wrong with this one."
4,filter fit and finish,I installed 2-filters on my boat and they fit as they should with no leaks. I also had no problems with fuel flow after installation.Everything worked as it should.
4,An excellent first book.,"If you've liked any of Thomas Perry's books, especially the Jane Whitehead series, you'll enjoy this debut novel.There's even a very memorable female character who is obviously a precursor to the Jane Whitehead character.Once I started reading, I went almost non-stop, despite being in a distracting environment."
5,A TERRIFIC READ!,What a surprise to find a book published in 1983 to be so fresh in its approach! You will miss a GREAT READ if you miss reading this one! My next step is to order all the Thomas Perry books I haven't read yet
4,the Butcher's boy,"This is an excellent book to pass the time with. Thomas Perry has his main character getting way out of her comfort zone, but she rises to job. The action is believable. I reccomend this book for those who appreciate well written books.WilliamB"
2,Perry lost me on this one,"I'm surprised at all the high praise for this book. I did not feel the slightest bit of sympathy for the hired killer. I found him very flat. The ending was unexpected; I expected a more complete wrap-up. Elizabeth was paranoid about being a woman in a job populated mostly by men. She was weak and dependent, but she was surprised when she was expected to do more menial chores than the men. She wasn't even very good at her job and seemed somewhat slow in her understanding of situaitons. Act weak, you get taken advantage of - man or woman."
2,Flat,"I found the book to be rather flat. The motives of the unnamed assasin were perfunctory, the heroine was ineffective and I don't think the character of Maureen served any puprose--how did she help the assasin or earn her pay?In the Introduction, Michael Connelly describes feeling sympathy for the assasin. I did not feel any. The assasin was cold and unsympathetic. Also, by referring to the assasin only as ""he"", Perry created some pronoun landmines in spots when he tried to juggle two he's and it wasn't clear which he was he (see how confusing that is?)."
4,Good writing,"This book was written in late 70s or 80s I think..... and every few pages that is revealed through the writing: most of the men wear suits, at the airport there's constant paging calls (""Mr. Jones to a courtesy phone), phone booths are on the street corners, police headquarters only has one computer - a big mainframe run by a programming expert...... little things like that. Must have been tough to get things done without the modern day luxuries such as cell phones and instant messaging.Great book though. Quality writing."
2,Unreadable,"Cardboard characters. Totally unrealistic plot devices. Your disbelief doesn't need to be willingly suspended, it needs to be drawn and quartered."
2,"With respect, but a poor work","I love Thomas Perry, who has written compelling and imaginative thrillers. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. The book seems to lift sections from his previous works, slaps them together with shallow, almost robotic characters and leaves me wanting. The ""Butcher Boy"" series, is in my opinion, now dead."
4,A twenty-five-year-old first novel--but a new author for me,"It was Michael Connelly's introduction that led me to this book. I read somewhere about the re-issue of ""The Butcher's Boy"" with an introduction by my favorite author and I was so impressed with Connelly's assessment of the book that I ordered it from Amazon. I enjoy reading debut novels and I will certainly continue to read Thomas Perry's books. Obviously, he has become an accomplished novelist since writing ""The Butcher's Boy"" and I am anxious to read more of his work."
5,"Perry's first, and best","I read this book in one sitting, something I've haven't done since. It always amazed me that a movie hasn't been made out out this great story line: Hit-man on the run, young female FBI agent and Mafia hit-men on his trail. What fascinated me was the detailed picture that Perry paints on the need of a person in a business such as the 'Butcher's Boy' to blend into the background and, by all means, NOT get noticed: what clothing to wear, what food and drink to order at a restaurant, how and where to walk. He's carried this on somewhat in his later books, which are all very good, but this is, I believe, his masterpiece."
5,"A fitting comparison to ""Day of the Jackal""...","This was one shrewd story. Accurately compared to ""The Day of the Jackal"", Perry puts the reader in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the green Justice Department analyst who is pursing a possible hit man on paper, as well as the flesh-and-blood hit man as he tries to escape from double-dealing employers and dumb old bad luck. Perhaps it is because said hit man is clearly bright and has such careful habits and such a will to survive. You wouldn't want a wolf in your back yard, but you do admire their skill, cunning, and life force.It seems that there are many mysteries set in and around Las Vegas lately but this one really does capture the seediness behind the scenes and the grainy textures of the life there.It is a complex, well-told story that is really quite unique in its approach and deserves a read if you're able. I had to scour the used bookstores for my copy - it is out of print."
2,"The Butcher,s Boy",It's just ok. A lot of dragging where a lot more substance could have been written in. I just didn't like it that much
4,"Thank heaven for another writer of ""Page-Turners""","I thought it was just me! I see a lot of these reviews are describing ""The Butcher's Boy"" as a page-turner, a novel they couldn't put down, a book they inhaled in 4 hours! That was my precise reaction: ""Thank heaven I've found another author of page-turners!"" It doesn't happen to me often enough.What I can't figure out is how Perry writes with such enjoyable economy and still manages to create that magic of gluing the reader to the text. If you are a writer yourself, this question is worth getting to the bottom of.A mesmerizing tale of a professional killer going about the business of evading his pursuers, ""The Butcher's Boy"" is a novel that will send you in search of more Thomas Perry books."
3,"Nice quality, but grip not perfect","Please take into account that this is my first Soft Tip dart purchase. I am a longtime thrower of steel tip darts and tend towards heavier darts. Although the set is very nice, it may take some time to get accustomed to the light weight of many soft tip darts (apparently a restriction due to the electronic boards). In addition, the grip could be a bit more positive. I am use to holding the dart in a certain way and the shape of the barrel on this dart interferes with that grip."
3,Arrived cracked,"The item arrived wrapped extremely well; bubble wrapped and double boxed. We had ordered a similar unit from Home Depot online that arrived shattered, so we were optimistic that this tank would be ok. It was, but the cover was cracked. We thought about making a claim, etc. but figured Amazon would want the whole unit returned, and after being without a downstairs toilet for over 3 weeks (the time including the Home Depot fiasco); we decided to go and buy a replacement lid for 39 dollars. We still broke even with the lid cost. This pressurized unit flushes fantastic! It took a few days to get used to the whooosh!!!! After reading reviews about how bad the American Standard 1.6 units flush; we were expecting the worst. We're very happy with this purchase."
2,"Bizarre, not in a good way","What was this movie about? Was it about religion, or sex, or what? I thought the part at the end where there were those circles of nude bathers was quite funny, and I don't know if it was supposed to be!"
1,Dirt Devil should be ashamed of themselves!!!,"This product at more then $300.00 is not a toy.I bought the (pool gir)l to clean the bottom of my pool. It picks up maybe 10% of the dirt on on the bottom. When I take it out to clean it, it dumps most of the dirt back into the pool that it picked up. I call (dirt devil) to tell them that I was totally disappointed with the ( pool girl) they told me that thats the way it operates. I will never buy anything (dirt devil) makes again!! This is the first review I have ever done."
4,Rik L Rik in Negative Trend,The Rik L Rik songs are actually Negative Trend songs recordedwhen Rik was in that band for a very short time. This was afterF-Word had broken up. Classic stuff.
4,Very illuminating,"I am fairly knowledgeable about the 18th century, but this book brought me some brilliant new insights and new viewpoints - especially on 18th century Prussia, on the popularity of George III and (oddly) of Joseph II. Superb illustration through the history of culture of how the 18th century monarchy in France, unlike that of Prussia and England, failed to connect with the ""public sphere"". I found the omission of the Dutch Republic regrettable and a few passages a little tedious; but for me the book ranks with Orlando Figes' Natasha's Dance (see my review) as one of the few books about periods with which I am pretty familiar that has given me so many new angles to think about."
3,not impressed,"I got this for my dauthter, but the Sothys beauty milk is a much nicer daily facial cleaner for me."
3,Call it what you may,"And I also love the singing. Callas sounds lovely, almost girlish, and she can handle the taxing coloratura, easily. The tenor is always off pitch, however. I much prefer a Monaco or Corelli, or even Pavarotti, if he'll stop sounding so nasal. But I have a problem with the extreme poor quality of the recording that makes this completely unacceptable. I can only listen to it in my car, with the windows open to lessen the noise. I recommend the version with Renata Scotto, who is truly underated as a coloratura soprano, or as a lyric soprano, in general. She has a beautiful voice, just like Tebaldi, and she can make you cry, just like Callas. I feel that if Sutherland had not appear, Scotto would have been the prima donna assoluta."
2,"bad sound, shrill singing, not a good choice","This has typical bad, bad sound with lots of noise. Callas uses her head voice trying to sound young, and instead sounded like a shrill soprano. This woman has no voice. How she conquered opera during the 1950's I'll never know. I think you all are suffering from ""Emperor's new clothes"". If you want to here Verdi as it is meant to be sung - and in stero, unlike Callas's mono, get the Sutherland set. She is the queen. It was Sutherland's supreme presence during the earliest of 1960 that force Callas out of retirment.P.S. Yes, I heard this recording in the college library...Gilda belongs to Sutherland, perhaps Callas should have sung the barmaid..."
5,Where were the sound engineers?,"I am NOT a fan of Callas but..... the performance here is outstanding. Everyone is top notch in this one.BUT.................................thanks to Walter Legge's famous phobic hatred of stereo sound, we get a dull sounding monophonic recording. Not bright, not clear at times. However, one does get enraptured by these fantastic performances. Couldn't EMI have done something to to improve the sound to current standards?That having been said, this one is definitely worth having for the amazing performances.Five stars for the performances, two and one-half for the sound quality."
5,Beautiful indeed!,"Bravo to those who fight this heartless basher! I too love this Rigoletto!!! In Gobbi, Callas and di Stefano it has an operatic dream-team. And even though there are other great Rigolettos, this one will always have a special place in my collection."
3,Bravo Gobbi,"I see some listeners gave this recording 5 stars, while others choose only 1 star. I'm going to give this Rigoletto it's true score, three stars. Gilda deserves a much lighter sound than La Divina can give us. Callas sounds too old and tired here to make sense of a teenage girl. For a better accounts of her unique voice, look to her 1954 Tosca, my personal desert island recording. Di Stafeno sounds pushed to me. But then, in my opinion, if he never met Callas, he would probably not get past singing solo in the choir. Gobbi, however is sensational as Rigoletto. He dominates, he soars, he just sends chills up your spine. If only we have the Rigoletto of Gobbi, with the Duke of Pavorotti, and the Gilda of the young Roberta Peters."
4,Takes a lot of patients to read this book,"After a couple of false starts, I was able to finally finish this book. I read it because I had seen ""Cabaret"" the movie and the play. I have not seen the play ""I am a Camera"" by Erik Von Deutten. However, I expected a faster moving story and really had to drudge through this. There are moments that you can identify with. However for the most part you feel like a third party. You may not want to identify with some of the characters.Whatever is supposed to make this book good is lost in the details.Well I read it but I am not sure I want to read anymore of his book. I feel a little cheated when one describes his use of English and the book is over before you find this. I feel a little embarrassed at not liking it with the praise it receives, but I guess you cannot like them all."
3,"A little dated, but has useful information","A lot has been happening in the Honda/Acura world since this book was written. Though it has useful techniques, newer ones are out that you have to locate through the internet or talk to knowledgeable sources at reputable shops. In one example, they spent a lot more money building up their Civic where parts of today can get the hp done for cheaper, like I did on mine. It was good to read, at least for me, to learn more about concepts I wasn't to sure about. So, it definitely is a plus for background info and terms. It makes a good reference"
3,"Did anyone at CarTech edit this ""book""?","From the standpoint of disbursing information about hot rodding a Honda -- I give it 4 stars; however, due to very sloppy editing I have to slide my overall rating down to 3 stars."
3,This is an engine building book,"I think that Petttit did a good job if you are looking to rebuild your engine or do some internal engine mods. There is not enough room in one book, however, to cover everything. The book by Ancas (Honda Performance Handbook) seems to pick up where this one leaves off. The Ancas book is more entertaining to read and doesn't repeat what you would find in a Honda Worshop manual. But if you want to do a rebuild yourself, you should buy the Pettit book too as Ancas doesn't go into internal engine details. I myself sent my block out to a Honda shop to have it done and don't really care to know exactly how they did it - just that they did it. But if you are serious about a Honda project, you really need both. The one thing they both avoid is the advertising-driven hype that you read in the magazines. That info is misleading and deal with pie-in-the-sky projects, not what we really drive on the street."
2,"Too technical, covered stuff too professional and expensive!","I own a 1992 Integra GSR and have been working on Hondas for about 4 years now. Joe's book was way too high-tech for the average home mechanic who tinkers in his spare time. I don't have access to the high tech equipment Joe referred to, I've only had limited dyno time (at $75 an hour) and the stuff he covered is never going to be attempted by the average Honda enthusiast. Most of his statements were so vague and unconclusive (e.g. AEM intake: did he recommend it? Who knows?) There were very few things I could actually apply to my own Honda Civic (at the time) and eventually I just gave the handbook away. The book is a waste, unless your Peter Yem or Bill Gude..."
2,not a book I would recommend,"I would not recommend this book and here's why: 1. The book does not go into enough detail for a beginner to understand the parts being described or how they operate. 2. For an experienced mechanic, they will understand what is being described but will already know the information being given.To summarize; the book is to advanced for the beginner but is not advanced enough for the experienced mechanic. Also, the hints and tips given in the book are not very informative nor are they secrets that most honda tuners don't already know."
3,"OK, but not the best.","I read the book from front to back and found that it was insightful in theory but lacked information on the technical aspect of engine building. I understood what the author was trying to say, but it didnt help me any in doing anything to my engine by myself. Basically, the book gives you information on what to do, but not really how to do it yourself. There are some pictures and sections which attempt to show you what to do, but they are way too vague to depend on the book as a reference if you were to attempt some of the mods detailed in the book."
1,waste of money,"you can get the same information in a $4 magazine or for free on the internet, big waste of money."
4,A sleeper,"Like The Goal, it was difficult for me to ""get hooked"" by it's opening pages. But then the first yellow post-it went up on his white board and it was all over. Now, I see tribal behavior appearing everywhere I turn. Local, state, and national governments; business; military; family; church; civic clubs; the application is everywhere. It's now been about two weeks since my first reading and I am already seeing positive changes in my relationships as a result of the application of what I have learned. I expect the matching of Great Boss Dead Boss with TOC will even more quickly produce extraordinary business results. If you are a TOC practitioner, you will enjoy exploring whether tribal behavior is the constraint."
1,"Warning, please, be careful before you buy this boring CD!","It was 2yrs ago. A friend of Mine purchased Maria Callas CD as a gift to me, however, I returned that CD with this stupid CD instead, since I didnot like Maria Callas at all at that time(and I found new love with Anglea Gheorghiu, it was her first full opera CD by her and her hubby). Well, except few arias, this Cd is so boring, I hardly listen to this CD anymore. Just thinking about for selling this Cd to the used CD store for something better. Well, definetly, it will be good idea to listen this Cd before you buy. Othewise you will be one of the sorry music fans like me. (Guilty feeling for my friend who doesn't know what I did, and big disappointment from very so so music with big hype from recording company and Gramophone magazine)."
2,KINDA BORING,HONESTLY I FOUND THIS BOOK PRETTY BORING...IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE JUICY STUFF ABOUT BIGGIE & TUPAC'S DEATH..I DONT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK .. IT STARTED OFF SLOW TALKING ABOUT THE LIFE OF THIS DETECTIVE.. I GAVE THE BOOK TWO CHANCES AND FOUND IT BORING... NOTHING INTERESTING IN IT TO ME.. BUT THATS JUST MY OPINION
5,Pleases my ear and speaks to my heart.,I am not a musicologist or an expert on opera. I only know what pleases my ear and speaks to my heart and this beautiful recording does both.Kiri Te Kanawa - German Opera Ariasis exquisite. Listening to these arias I know that Kiri's voice was made for the German language.I enjoy everything in this compilation but I particularly love the Richard Strauss selections from ARIADNE AUF NAXOS and DAPHNE.It's nice to be able to reach forKiri Te Kanawa - German Opera Ariaswhen I want to hear the German language sung as beautifully as only sung by the great Kiri Te Kanawa.
1,¡Decepcionante!,"Sin lugar a dudas, Kiri Te Kanawa es una de las grandes sopranos líricas del siglo anterior, pero creo que este disco no refleja el arte canoro de la artista. Si bien podrían citarse muchísimos atributos y fortalezas vocales, resaltan en todas las arias un excesivo vibrato que afecta la línea musical."
5,At the name of Jesus,At the Name of JesusNice quick but informative devotional. Gives scripture and a small bite to think on thru the day.
5,The Radical Cross,"""The Radical Cross"" is yet another great title by AW Tozer and focuses on the supreme cost that Jesus Christ gave so we may have eternal life with Him in heaven. In Jesus Christ, we also can have the abundant life here on earth (though, not necessarily in physical riches).Among some of the topics covered include:1. Be careful of the church that tries to make you too comfortable.2. There are times that Christ's followers must walk alone.3. Jesus Christ came to die for all people.4. Suffering for Christ's sake has a great purpose.5. The Christian life is one of paradoxes that conflict with the world: to live we must die, to be victorious we must surrender to Christ, to be the greatest in God's kingdom we must serve others.These are just a few of the topics covered so eloquently by Tozer. Although he died almost 50 years ago, his works still speak clearly to us today.Read, enjoy, and be challenged.Highly recommended."
4,Great read...,"An absolute great read. Tozer takes the revelation of the Cross to new heights & standards. He takes the Cross out of the arena of being ""cute"" & ""sweet"" & puts it back in it's intended position in Christianity. This is a definite MUST for your library."
4,Mitchum noir,"While ""Farewell My Lovely"" at times resembles a low-budget made-for-tv movie, it's also notable for two gems - it features Mitch (in one of his premier performances) in a quintessential rendering of an aging gumshoe, and it offers a soundtrack of haunting beauty, especially during the opening credits."
2,"Good movie, bad tape.",Re Farewell My Lovel (VHS Tape): The tape was blurry and jumpy. Pity. It's a great movie. That and the fact it was the only copy of it I could find was the only reason I rated it as high as two stars.
5,This is the DVD you want,I just purchased the Region IV DVD. I won't go into reviewing the show cuz if you are here you already know what an outstanding film this is but if you have a multi-region DVD player you have to add this to your collection. The picture transfer is great. The colors are bright and the mono sound is acceptable. Don't imagine it can get any better than this due to the age of the film and production standards at the time. Sit back and enjoy as I have.
1,Bad Deal,"I was very EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase. The DVD was rejected by my player because it is encoded for Region 2, which I have since learned to my dismay is for machines in Europe, Japan, and the Middle East and not North America. I am most disappointed that Amazon would allow this to be marketed in the U.S. (The seller is, I believe, from North Carolina. Perhaps I am at fault for not reading the fine print. If so, I have learned a valuable lesson, and it is this: Read the fine print and be leery of Amazon sales... I would have rated this no stars, but I am forced by the system to give it at least one star."
1,I dont know how to permanently keep it to show in my region. which is USA not anywhere else.,"I guess Iam the unlucky one with a bad dvd on ""farwell my lovely"" Why not just America, It is an American movie, isn't it."
2,Not what it oughta be,"This film, despite what many others say, is a big disappointment. ""Biography"" shows only shortened clips of the brothers dancing, and spends far too much time telling us of their personal peccadillos. Even the ""Stormy Weather"" scene is hacked up, with too much talk and choppy pieces. The virtuosity, the talent, the ability to glide slightly above the earth that these two have is not the focus of the film; rather, the details, sometimes tawdry, of their lives is the focus. Too bad. Buy the film ""Stormy Weather"" instead."
3,This Sir Topham Hatt - Not HO Scale,"This item came quickly and is in great shape, however, the specs on the item say that it is HO scale. It is not. Someone needs to take this out of the specs. Sir Topham is certainly the fat conductor and not at all HO scale."
5,A favorite character,"Sir Topham Hatt is a name often used by our grandchildren, and now they can own and play with his likeness. The detail is complete and accurate to the character they enjoy watching on video. The construction is of fine quality and durable. Just the proper size for a child's hand, and easy to stand on the ample base."
1,Mom,"I bought this awhile ago for my grandson, who loves thomas the train, especially sir topham hatt, it cost me more to ship than to buy it, but being a grandmother that's okay. when the product arrived I was so disappointed as he couldn't play with it so was he . the one arm that is extended broke when he tried to move it. I didn't try to send it back as I figured I was already into the shipping for more than the cost. it's only good for display expensive experience.definitly not worth the money"
4,Nice addition to the Thomas the Train adventure,Every Thomas the Train adventure needs Sir Topham Hat. This was a good buy and very durable.
1,Not very durable.,"I got this for my sons Thomas collection. Within ten minutes, the arm had already broken off and the paint was scratching off.My son is age five and this toy is listed for 8 and up. This toy was a lot smaller than it appears also."
3,A needed accessory for Thomas Train lovers,"Small, expensive but it's a feature longed for by 3-year old grandson. He owns a train table (wooden Thomas Train) and would love to have all the trains too."
5,Contains some obscure plants I couldn't find elsewhere!,"This has been the BEST plant, tree, and brush/shrub identification book I've found yet! Although it doesn't have ""flowers"" or ""berries"" in the title, flowers and berries are in there (well, if they're a shrub, like wild roses, but not like irises or chocolate lillies)...Black and white sketches with a few color photographs, AK state map of distribution, some historical notes, and, sometimes, common uses are listed (although I haven't seen any medicinal uses). Vegetations grouped by family. Detailed description of the plant from the leaf to bark to twigs to flower to berry (if applicable) to wood (if applicable)...detailed enough to differentiate between two closely related species. Great reference book!"
4,A very helpful and hopeful book,The First Year---Parkinson's Disease: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosedis a very helpful book. It has done a good job in telling me what to expect. It was hopeful in that it suggested that I still have many years left before Parkinsons closes in on me. The style is light and easy to read. At the same time it is helpful in that it leads you through all of the stages. At the same time it suggest things you should do -- like letting your family know what is going on.
1,outdated,"This book was probably an excellent resource when it was published, but with the advances in Parkinson's treatment, the book is outdated. On my doctor's advice, I have torn it apart, so that others will not be scared by the contents."
3,Mechanics of machines,Kinematics of machines is usually defined as the study of the relative motions of machine parts. The emphasis has been place here rather than one the descriptions of mechanisms.
5,Secret Best Seller,"This book went through more than 20 printings in ten years. Unfortunately, that means that Amazon Marketplace sellers felt it necessary to create new product pages for each one. The 1963 printing is the same as the 1960 printing is the same as the 1958 printing is the same as the 1954 first printing. Too bad Amazon can't combine these listings and give us a true picture of where it stands on the ""best seller"" list."
4,urbanism in the American context,"Here is a comprehensive study of urbanism, with an emphasis on American cities. The chapters were written by various authors, from the 1940s-50s. The authors explain several issues like demography and how this has or can change in a city. Driven by such causes as technological change or socio-environmental factors like improved life expectancies.There is also a chapter on volunteer groups, written in 1942. The US had a surfeit of these, compared to Europe. People came together from a commonality of interests, into such groups as Rotary or Masons. An interested reader should compare this chapter with the recent ""Bowling Alone"" text, that decried a fall in participation in such groups during more recent years."
4,"Great CD, maybe too much trip-hop","This is a very different Global Underground release. A lot of trip-hop, hip-hop elements here. At moments you feel you are listening to a Chemical Brothers album. At the second half of CD #2, things roll more to a deep trance-house. Track 15 (Gravastar) of CD #2 pays your money, that's a fact.I am not very fond for trip-hop hard beats, but I welcome the diversity of sounds. Worth buying, no doubt, after all, NO Global Underground release is ever bad.I give this record 4 stars because I expected something darker and more techno."
3,Great in the Begining....,"Disappointed. Thats all I can say about the phones I purchased.Thank god, I kept my receit. In the beginning, I had no issues..clairty was great to me, Size was perfect, Price was also great. After about 3 Weeks, issues started becoming apparent. Speakerphone went out, and some of the other buttons stopped working properly. I returned it, and got a replacement (Same Model) this time with an answering machine. After 2 Weeks, it stopped taking messages. My friends thought I was being rude for not returning important Messages. I suppose I should taken closer notice, for they are now all being marked down for clearance. Bottom line: Looks great, but unless you plan on never using it....I would suggest another.Thanks...On my way back to return mine."
2,Looks great but fails to deliver,"I was sucked into buying this ""high tech"" phone because of it's sleek and futuristic appearance and it's myriad of bells and whistles. I was, however, quickly disappointed because the phone fails to deliver on the most basic of functions. Daily I deal with calls being interrupted due to the handset losing communication with the base unit. Also, the unit has the capability of adding up to 3 additional handsets that all communicate with one base unit. I added one handset (which alone was more expensive than many complete phone units)and unfortunately, it only worked for a few weeks before it developed such horrendous static and interference that I just stopped using it altogether.My lesson learned from this experience is that just because it looks like a Mercedes doesn't mean it functions like one!"
1,not buying vtech again....,"I am disappointed in this product. I bought it because it looked nice. I had my vtech phone for a little over a year (just long enough to be out of the warranty) and all of a sudden the ""on"" and ""off"" buttons stopped working. I could not pick up phone calls. I had to call people back on my cell phone when they left a message. It is cheaper to buy a new phone than to send the thing in for repair. The phone is nice looking and compact, but that is no good if it does not work. It is not worth the money for only a year's use. I would not buy one of these phones again."
1,Great phone if you like phones that don't work well.,"This phone worked reasonably well for about a year. Although it worked, there were some volume problems, the speakerphone was a joke, and reception was mediocre. After a year the phone started working only 50% of the time. Overall I would say this phone is pretty bad."
3,Disappointed,"I had hoped to upgrade to a phone that would improve range, quality, etc. Unfortunately, the sound quality on this phone is NOT good...in fact, noticeably worse, than that of an inexpensive 900 MHZ cordless I have been using. It's going back -- too expensive to settle for less quality. Still surprised since previous V-Tech phones I have used were quite good. Not sure if the problem is this phone or the 2.4Ghz technology."
1,Be sure you can return it before you buy it!,"I purchased this phone because it had a fantastic look and excellent features for the price.Unfortunately, its terrible constant background hiss, poor sound quality, and miserable battery life convinced me there's much more to a phone than just looks."
5,No problems,"I don't get any of the interference mentioned in other reviews... this phone works perfectly and I love it. Not sure what they meant about the ""hollow"" sound, as I don't notice any discernable differences. My handset and base communicate just fine when they're right next to each other. Handset doesn't have speed dial per se, but ability to store numbers for quick dial (like a phone book on my cell phone). As others have mentioned, I like the speakerphone capability on both the handset and base. I like the frequency hopping spread spectrum technology for a more secure call. I like the earpiece compatibility (2.5 mm plug) for hands-free calls. Battery life between charges is great. Definitely like the expandability feature - I went out and bought an additional handset. I like how this phone looks and how it fits in my hand."
2,"Good phone in theory, Bad phone in reality.","I had the honor of purchasing this phone from a now defunct dot-com just before they went under, which is the only reason I did not return this phone. I was attracted by the myriad of features and abilities of this phone, but find the resulting product a bit disappointing. There is a bit of an echo which gives the effect of trying to talk to someone while standing in a tin can. The range of this phone is not quite up to par with my old 900MHz phone, which means that I can almost walk out my front door without losing reception. In addition to all this, the antenna on one of the hand-sets (yes, I purchased two of these works of art) is going out, leaving me with periods of zero communication.But it was a good idea, VTech..."
5,It's a terrific phone,"I'm not sure about the others complaining of bad sound/poor range. I found neither to be true. The range exceeds that of my last two 900MHz phones ~ 125-150 feet (through several brick walls). Loaded with features; the handsfree on the handset is very nice, although it can be difficult to hear with a lot of ambient room noise because the speaker is on the back of the handset and it gets washed out if the TV or radio is on. Very nice menu features and the volume control ""goes to 11,"" that is, the high end is probably louder than you'd like - which is a refreshing change (I'm sure the people that use the loudness feature on pay phones might appreciate this)."
2,"Seemlingly nice phone, but serious problems lurk...","Great feature list, but here's what doesn't work well:1. The phone randomly decides to reset itself, usually when you are picking up an incoming call. This behavior occurs on a colleague's phone as well.2. The handsfree feature is half duplex, and it works poorly enough that I don't bother using it anymore.3. The memory capability is simplistic and awkward. It doesn't share the phone numbers between handsets, and you can't edit a number that you receive through caller ID (well, you can edit it, but if you have to shorten or lengthen the number, you're out of luck) It'd be nice if the caller ID call back would automatically figure out how to dial based on your area code as well, but no such luck.I put up with this phone for a year, simply because I hate spending ... on something just to throw it away. I'm looking for a better product now."
1,Save Your Money,"The VTech 2431 2.4GHz phone looks great and is loaded with features. But the range is terrible and there is a constant low hum on the line during conversations, plus occasional echoing. I spent an hour on the phone with Vtech technical support and followed all their recommendations like moving the base upstairs to get better reception, but to no avail. I even exchanged the phone for another one thinking it might be defective. Finally, I gave up and returned the phone."
2,Not so great after about a year,"At first I thought this was a great phone because of it's speakerphone abilities on the base as well as on the headset. Now I'll be lucky if this thing answers a call without dropping the call while ""Searching for Base"" even though I'm standing 2 feet from it. It would be a great phone if it would do it's primary job- answer calls!"
1,run away!!!,"this is a terrible piece of equipment. half the time you can't answer an incoming call without it ""searching for base"" and losing the call. sometimes it just won't dial at all. we didn't get any interference, but we didn't feel that made up for its other serious problems. occasionally we would lose calls in the middle of a conversation because it felt the need to ""search for base"". my niece has a different model vtech and hers is just as bad. she can't leave her room with the phone. my suggestion is to avoid vtech phones altogether. they should stick to making children's toys."
5,This phone is the best,"I just bought this phone, and it is the best thing that I have ever bought. I don't know why people are ""Dissapointed"" with this item. It goes pretty far, like a couple of blocks, and has tons of features. The only dissadvantage with this item is that an answering machine is not built into it. There is a site where you can purchase the answering machine that goes with it, but I can not recall it. This phone also has a speaker on the back of the handset. So you can push a button called ""Handsfree"" and just talk into the back of the phone if your ear is getting tired. This phone is a MUST BUY!!!"
2,"Great features, lousy quality","This cordless phone has great features - speakerphone on base and handset, caller ID, memory dial.Sound quality is quite bad however- even with the great features, I had to return it. Tinny sound to the handset, the speaker on the handset sounds abysmal, and the quality of the construction seems poor. Really small handset, and somehow didn't feel as comfortable as my old cordless phones. Finally, didn't like any of the 6 hyper pitched ring tones."
2,Mixed up phone with poor quality control,"The reviews here seem accurate based on my experiences. When the phone works its great, but unfortunately it does not always work. Mine was not clear when I first received it, but after a few weeks of use the sound quality and range was excellent. However, it then began to occasionally drop calls (battery charge was fine). After several months of randomly droped calls, it has stoped functioning as a phone (although the intercom works great still and the base speaker phone is fine)."
3,not the best value out there,"I have owned this phone for roughly 3 months now. I am relatively satisfied with it, but would certainly not purchase it again, as I believe there are better phone for the money out there. The features are great, including the speaker phone function on the handset, but the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. I have had to buy a second battery as well because of a dismal battery life. Since you can charge one in the base while the other is in the handset, this is an inconvenience that can be remedied, but at an extra cost.In short, a nice phone, but it has not lived up to my expectations and is not worth a premium price."
2,2.4 Gigahertz...I don't think so!,"My old Vtech DSS 900Mhz has better reception. I'm quite disappointed with the reception range. I couldn't even go two rooms away and it starts to break up. My walls are made of concrete. I called tech support and was told that frequency should penetrate through them with ease. Well, not so. I can't even show it off to friends and family. I might just get embarrased with this so-called 2.4 gigahertz phone. Another problem that I discovered is that the voice-mail indicator doesn't work.The design, however, is cool. Looks like a cell phone. I like the handset intercom. The sound is loud but again it breaks up. I will probably return it and get a different brand."
1,Horrible Reception,"Okay, I read all the reviews so I was warned; but the features were exactly what I needed so I took a chance. It didn't pay off. The features were fantastic: multiple handsets, speakerphone (one on handset is cool too), visual v-mail indication on base and handsets, convenient small size. The handset sound wasn't the best, but I could live with it.But the phone was totally unusable. First, the handset that came with the base worked sometimes, but it also often completely garbled my speech. I thought (hoped) it was just a bad handset, so I moved the extra handset onto the base. That handset had such bad reception that I was close enough to the base to switch to speakerphone yet the person I was speaking to couldn't understand me over the handset (the batter was fully charged).I wanted to like it, I tried to like it, but when it comes down to it, the phone has to support the basic functions of speech, and that's where this one fails."
2,I did not like this phone.,"This is an expensive phone and I was expecting better sound quality. It looks neat and I loved how it looks and its small size, however the sound quality was worse than my old Panasonic 49mhz phone that was 6 years old. There was a echo when I talked and a constant humming sound that I could not get rid of. For all the hype about 2.4 gigahetz phones I am not impressed. I returned it for Toshiba FD-9859 for less than half the cost and have been very happy with Toshiba's 900 digital phone."
2,A big disappointment.,"This phone drives me nuts. I wish I could return it. Half the time, when I press the button to answer it, nothing happens. The range isn't that good either. Don't waste your money."
2,I can't recomend this phone,"I read the reviews and found them to be inconclusive. Some people love this phone, others don't. After spending a few days with the one I just bought (and returned) I have to say I come down on the negative side. There was an incessant hiss in the background which really got irritating. I also could not seem to get rid of a sort of echo/reverb that was quite distracting. While I liked the size of the phone, the handset is not paticularily comfortable to hold. The headset I tried, just made all the audio problems worse. Why can't someone make a small cordless phone that sounds good and works? The menu options are difficult to navigate, especially volume which varies from call to call for some reason. All in all, I would not recomend this phone. BTW: AT&T and Panasonic both sell this same phone in different packaging. Post review note: A friend of mine suggests uncoiling the power cord helps with the static, as they use it as the antenna."
1,PHONEPHANATIC,"I HAD THIS PHONE FOR 8 MONTHS, AND I LOVE NEW TECHNOLOGY WITH TELEPHONE. THIS PHONE CONTINUALLY SHUTS DOWN (SEARCHING FOR BASE), DURING YOUR CONVERSATIONS, WHILE YOUR PHONE IS RINGING (WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO ANSWER IT). IT COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN FOR AT LEAST 1 MIN. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS V TECH. I HAD THE V TECH CORDLESS BEFORE THIS ONE. NOW IM STILL IN SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE PHONE."
3,Almost great,"I've had much lesser phones and I've had better. But the V-Tech 2.4GHz is a great choice for those wanting a middle-of-the-road, joe-blow, average phone. The price is great and the specs rate up with much higher end phone systems. I have had problems with the headset jack and the overall sound quality is slightly distant sounding. Not so much, however, that you don't get used to it as long as you don't have a lot of background noise. Speakerphone is great and the flexibility of ring tones and other options leave a lot for the gadget [expert] to tweak on for a while. If you don't want to jump up to the ($) phones, go with the V-Tech."
2,Earpiece sound was poor,Receiving a call and listening on the supplied Handset was poor. If I plugged in my own Headset the reception was good. Talking on the phone was fine. The party on the other end could hear me quite well. Vtech needs to improve the acutal earpiece used for hearing in the handset.
3,Features - 10 Execution - 3,"Just received my phone, and unfortunately, I am finding similar problems as others here, namely: 1. Sound quality BITES. Constant hiss, echo sometimes, distortion (crackling sound) when I speak. Sounds like something you would get at ToysRUs. 2. Message waiting indicator does not work (phone co. settings are OK) 3. Feels small, light, and cheap. 4. Question the cosmetic durability. I have seen some floor models in the store which showed the silver color having worn off. (Granted, they get beat to crap, but still in comparison to the other beat-up models)I'll probably return it. Are there any other models with similar features (multi-handset, message ind., ? The Panasonic looks/feels much more robust, but does not have the features."
1,"Poor Voice Quality, Good Features...","I really wanted to like this phone. Even though it was pricey, I thought it would be a great tool. Indeed, the VTech 2431 has tons of great features: mute, multiple handsets, headset jack, speaker phone, base dialing, slim design, etc.HOWEVER, the voice quality was extremely poor. People on the other end of the line consistently said it sounded like I was underwater or in a tunnel. There is also constant buzzing sound even after trying several different locations. No amount of trouble shooting helped.In summary: you buy a phone so you can have clear, trouble free conversations with people. And unfortunately, this is where the VTech 2431 fails. I'm returning mine..."
1,"LCD-lousey,cheap,display!","I am on my second VTech 2431. The first one, the display quit working in less than a week. I considered this to be a fluke so I returned it to exchange for another one on 09-05-00. On 11-14-00 the display would not display anything when the memory or menu keys were pushed. Two times is a charm to me and this will be my last overrated VTech phone. Be advised!"
3,College student,"A young child goes for a walk. This story has repetitive rhyme for the very young child. The child first sees a black cat. As he walks, he sees a variety of animals. The cat follows him, as well as the other animals. He or she meets: a brown horse, a red cow, a green duck, a pink pig and a yellow dog. In the story, the child is missing one shoe as he meets the pig. Each time a partial glimpse of the animal is shown in the illustrations. The reader can play a guessing game.The child is not defined by the story as being a boy or a girl. I wanted to know. Children memorize the book as they read it over and over again. Memorization is the first stage of reading. The illustrations were beautiful. The text didn't have much meaning as far as the plot goes."
2,not great,"The story is short and repetitive, not particularly fun to read aloud. The illustrations are beautiful, but the child is freaky looking and wearing weird clothes. It doesn't bother my child, but I don't like looking at it. We rarely read this one."
3,I Went Walking,"My toddler loves the book because of the repetition, and his loving it is really what matters. To me,it reminds me too much of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? by Bill Martin/Eric Carle. The illustrations are mediocre and there are only six animals in the book."
5,"beautiful scenery, lovely music",I watched it this afternoon and thought it was very relaxing. I liked the music and of course the ocean and all the beautiful flowers and palm trees. The sunsets were quite beautiful too. I'd like to return to Hawaii someday. I'm sharing it with some of the neighbors.
3,Serenity Moments: Hawaiian Islands Scenic Relaxation DVD,Music and Camera work is great.The person doing the Guided Meditation part ruins it by bringing up her Religious concepts.Otherwise a good DVD.
5,Perfectly Relaxing,"This DVD was exactly what I was looking for. I have problems falling asleep, and find it almost impossible to do without a movie in. The beautiful scenery and calming music were exactly what I was hoping for, and it's also great to have on just as background ambiance in the house. Excellent Find!!"
3,Total mind candy,"This is speculative fiction in which it's postulated that the South has won the Civil War. It's a fun book. The analysis of the battle of Gettysburg is interesting -- that's obviously where Skimin did his research -- and the maps are good. The courtroom drama scenes are exciting, and one ends up wishing the author had included an epilogue telling us whether his imaginary CSA really made it. Now, the faults -- Skimin didn't really do his research on social behavior. His characters are astonishingly promiscuous for higher-class people of the time, especially the women. Also, his historical characters, particulary Stuart and Mosby, while reasonably engaging as imaginary people, don't really resemble the real-life version of themselves very much. His Stuart is too humorless, his Mosby too benevolent, his Breckenridge far too malevolent, his Longstreet too crazy. Nevertheless, if you take it as mind candy and not a serious work of literature, Gray Victory is quite a page-turner."
1,Minimal Info,"I was not very impressed with this DVD. It provided only basis training and health information about dogs, not in particularly about the pekingese breed. The price of the DVD for what is offered is ridiculous."
5,Baby's Favorites,"Purchased this board book as a gift. Babies LOVE the full face, full color photographs of other babies. These are very popular in library programs for babies as well as home use. I hope they start printing the entire series again."
5,5 month old babies love it!,"A friend borrowed this book from the library for her 5 month old. Her baby immediately responded to the large pictures of baby faces. My son also loved it (he's now 8 months) and all the babies I've handed this book to like to gaze at the faces. Most of the photography/board books are too small and my son isn't interested in them yet. This book is the perfect size for younger babies, since the photographs are almost life-sized. Buy it for your baby or anyone who has a newborn."
2,Received units that are different than described,"The units I received have much smaller shafts for the knobs than the pictured units and the shafts are not grooved to fit a grooved hole in the knob, they have a flat that requires the knob to have a set screw to attach them. The thinner diameter is much less robust and I'm concerned they're going to break off given the kind of use I intend. The pictured units would have been perfect.Additionally I believe, but have not measured to verify, that the units I received are audio taper pots rather than linear. This could be an effect of my circuit, I haven't verified the cause of the non-linearity I'm seeing.The quality is acceptable, the metal case is strong enough and the board is solidly staked down. I give them 2 stars because they are not what I ordered."
3,Tug of Love : Jason or Junior,Who did the yellow labrador belong to. Was his name Jason or Junior. Neil Parker And his sister Emily had to figure out the mystery of the yellow labrador. The reputation of King Street Kennel was on the line.Tug of Love is a heart-warming story with exciting turns and twists in every chapter.
3,not impressed,I did not realize my 1 year old would not like the small size. He always goes to his bigger books and ignores this one. After reviewing it I was disappointed in the pictures of the trucks.
3,Interesting choices...,"I bought this book because I love that it has real pictures of the trucks. I find their choice of trucks slightly odd. Many of them are older models or seem to be incredibly obscure vehicles. I think they could have used more common vehicles or at least newer ones so they would reflect what my child sees. This book is cute, but I don't think I would recommend it."
5,great for girls too!,"my DAUGHTER loves things that go - trucks, buses, cars...we both have learned lots from this book -- there are so many types of trucks and things that go that I did not the names to and many common things we see every day like the mail truck or fire truck."
4,Solid Book,"I collect Aferican-American cookbooks. My perfect book is a good mix of authentic recipes and backroung info to add to heritage of the recipe. While I like the format and actual page layout of other African-American cookbooks better, this book has some solid recipes. Where this book excels over others is that there is a story behind nearly every recipe and there is lots of variety in the recipes. The recipes are easy to follow and do remind you of church anniversary dinners!"
2,book condition,"The book smelled like it had been stored a damp basement. I could not get pass the smell, so it was thrown away."
4,mystery,This cd is surprisingly solid for the killa. Bounty hasn'tput forth a totally solid cd since my Xperience and I was very happy to listen again and again. There are mostly new rhythms here and about 6 or 7 tracks you may have heard other artists on so in that way you will not be bored. The way I judge a ragga cd is based on originality and growth. There are many djs out there who can chat their version of a good rhythm but not many can make new sounds work the way beenie and bounty can. A refreshing surprise come back for the killa with a variation that I had been hoping for.
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I am very familiar with all these songs, having sung them myself while a student with Martial Singer. I think that her interpretation is better than many singers I've listened to, most of whom think they are singing Italian music. But I was really disappointed with her vocal technique. There are some really ugly sounds here, strangly juxtaposed, and as different one from the other as milk and vinaigre. Sometimes a really lush, large voice is evident; then, there is a tinny, harsh or whiney bit. It seems to me that, if you have a large voice, piano or forte are measured within your particular vocal diameter; and sounding strange for effect, if done too often, is just strange. Given the praise I've read of this singer, I was amazed."
5,A Magnificent Performance !,"I can only say that Tito Gobi has a voice and performance that is, in this opera, the very best that I have ever heard."
3,Poor Callas,Maria Callas does not perform strongly on this album. That is too bad because she has many wonderful recordings. The included libretto was quite good and very easy to use.
2,disappointed,"I don't like this recording. I've borrowed a lot of Callas recording from a huge Callas fan. Sorry, I don't like her voice."
5,Il Barbiere di Siviglia,"After purchase of a disappointing version of Rossini's Barber, I heard this recording. Historically definitive, we are fortunate to have this excellent version available.What is so great? The Philharmonia Orchestra, Luigi Avla as Almaviva, Callas as Rosina, and Gobbi as the Barber, along with the chorus, all brilliantly capture the Italian flavor of Rossini's genius. The EMI sound quality is perfect! One may listen over and over just to hear Luigi Alva's splendid interpretation. Quite funny as well!"
1,Truely expensive garbage,"I ordered Bertie the bus for my son. It arrived after a long wait, and first of all it is listed for kids 8+. Reason is because it is made of really cheap plastic.... something you will find in a dollar store for one dollar (for package of 4). Even at 25 cents I think it is too expensive. You get the idea.Save your money and spend it elsewhere."
5,Deadly Brew: She Loved Him to Death,"This mystery is well thought out and supplies clues along the way for those who like to try to solve the crime before the author gives the answer. However, just when I thought I had the answer, the author surprised me with an unexpected twist in the plot. This is an easy read but one that keeps you on your toes. I've read the book twice and am now giving it to friends."
2,A lot of the same,"From what I see this book has a lot of listings of guns, but is hard to find what you are looking for. There are about 750 different guns and accessories (including all the different versions of some guns, and gernade launchers), compaired to the Ultramodern Firearms at 250.This book lacks tables of any type, except for a few where they show the different versions of certain weapons. Trying to find a weapon can prove to be a challenge with the large number of guns from all generations.Overall, too much info, not enough use..."
3,very very average,"I am rather surprised at the quality of this supplement, especially when compared to the other books in the series. This book is well presented and attractive when it comes to the actual book, layout and art. But is also full of errors and repeats, you could just as easily buy a copy of Janes and use comparable stats from the campaign book. If you simply must have a D20 weapons guide Ultramodern Firearms is much better. And The Modern Arms Guide for Spycraft is also very good, with statistics that are a big more on the realistic side and it covers more weapon types than Weapons Locker or Ultramodern Firearms."
2,lots of stuff but could have been much better,I have to agree with most of the other reviews I've read. It's alot of useful stuff but not in any useable order. It really looks like a sub-standard product from wizards. I bought it mostly for inspiration for creating stuff for other games but was still kinda dissapointed with it.
4,Worth it,"""Snipes"" is entertaining. It's not a cinematic masterpiece, nor does it aspire to be. It's leaps and bounds better than your average hip-hop movie where the latest rapper du jour gets a starring vehicle...""Exit Wounds"" with DMX was a painful movie to watch. ""Snipes"" is enjoyable. Sure, there are some scenes that stretch the limits of plausibility, but all in all, it's a fun movie.In the interest of full disclosure, I must say that I worked on this movie as a Production Assistant, but I'm not biased. I only worked on it for 2 days. But in one scene, they put me in the movie. I get carjacked near the end. Of course, I had to sit through the entire movie to see my 5 seconds of screen time, but ""Snipes"" made it an enjoyable wait. Check it out if you like fun urban thrillers."
4,The movies all good! My friend would enjoy this to!,"I also gave my friend this movie on his birthday to. The acting was a little straight! I don't know if Nelly is good at acting! I like Nelly, but I thank he should just stick to rapping, but I ain't mad at him! Shot out to Nelly! Oh I can't forget about Zoe Salanda! She's a pretty good actress! No doubt! Once again Thanks Amazon!Dee SmallsDecatur GA"
1,Pete Ross 4 eva,"Sj3 is the effin' man, dawg. When he ain't helpin' out in Smallville with his amazing deliverence of ""Aw Snap"", or doing death defying stunts (See the episode where he says ""It's ok, byron"" and gets thrown, then gets run into by a car. A parked car.). And he was awesome as that autistic hero in Zig Zag, downright brilliant, makes me think he should have been the lead in Titanic. Leo who? Leonardo Jones III, that's who.But none of this flick measures up to the spouting of his one line per episode of Smallville. ""Bad"" Pete is the bomb digity. And he does it with dignity. ""For you, green means stop, red means go.""SJ3 is a shallow nickname, let's step it up, SJ Cubed.Snap on, brother."
5,Still great for kids of all ages.,This is the book I grew up having read to me - then reading myself when I was old enough. I am so glad to be able to carry on the tradition to the next generation.
4,"We looked for the Queen, but she never came........","Every kid must love the REAL Christopher Robin and Pooh, or so I feel. Anyway, I got my first exposure to the pleasures of language from these wonderful rhymes. But Now We Are Sixty and perhaps a bit behind the times...I bought this for a friend's grandson, thinking it was better than not that he should have them and no one else was going to do that for him. He's five and I don't think anyone reads to him, but he's starting to do it himself. There are enough people who think it important that he have the latest X-box. I have second thoughts about the meaning of the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace to a kid growing up in east Harlem.It was a great price and the book is as wonderful as ever, but it arrived 10 days later than promised. (post-, instead of pre-Christmas)"
5,"for children, this is incomparable",lovely short poems dealing with some observations and small anxieties of childhood...wonderful rhyme schemes...interesting situations....totally charming. One or two gratifying I-told-you-so poems from Christopher Robin to the world at large....this book puts life into perspective for a child.
2,Somewhere between basic reference and step-by-step guide,"I had to buy this book as it was used for a beginner's course on Flash, but I was very disappointed - not so much with the course but with this book. It tells you how to use this tool and how to use that tool, but never tells you WHY. Like, ok now I can convert to a MovieClip, but why would anyone want to do that, and so on and so on. If you know a bit about Flash, I guess you can easily dig up something in this book if you forgot how to motion tween or something - but then, as a reference guide as well, pretty much any other book on Flash is more thorough. Basically: this book is very superficial - I guess to not overload the novice - but then, it doesn't explain you much either. For the experienced Flash-user looking for a reference guide, look elsewhere."
1,Mens Blank Stringer Y Back Cotton Tanktop,"This T was poorly made. When worn it hung crookedly. Would not even wear it to bed, let alone in public. Very uncomfortable!!"
3,ok for the price,Great price for something that you aren't going wear out. This is really just to wear around the house or the gym and the price is right. Shrank a little but seemed big to begin with. the color runs on the first wash to watch out for that.
3,Nice workout shirt!,Not the highest quality ... but these tank tops are great for workout and just for wearing while laying around the house!
3,A well illustrated overview,"An attractively illustrated book, this is not however really something you can read cover to cover: it's more in the style of an encyclopedia article. Nor is it really a complete reference work, since a number of intermediate classes are simply omitted, e.g., Gato class subs are fully covered, but the Balao and Tench classes are unmentioned.Quite good enough for a dabbler like me, but this will not satisfy someone looking for the kind of comprehensive treatment one associates with Jane's."
2,makes a nice glossy toilet book,"Its not a BAD book, but there are too many typos, editorial mistakes and factual errors to list. Many of them are quite obvious such as wrong or missing pages listed in the index or measurement unit conversion errors (e.g. meters to feet). Who knows what else.Its annoying, but since I have another similar (and superior) book to take its place (""Submarines"" by John Parker, pub. Hermes House) its just a glossy toilet book. Shook my confidence in Janes, I got the Naval Institute Combat Fleets instead of Janes offering alternatively.[hardcover]Cheers!"
3,It must be updated,"One of the submarine accident of Turkey shown in ""appendix-2:The submarine accidents 1905-2000"" as lost. The lost one ""TCG ATILAY"" was found in 1992. She hit a WW-2 mine at the approaches of Canakkale Straigt(Dardanels). The other submarine ""TCG DUMLUPINAR"" sunk after colliding with a merchant at Canakkale Straight.Also there is no place called Constantinople for centuries. It must be Istanbul. And Scutari must be Uskudar.Burak AKCAY"
3,Works but Visibly Lower Quality,I bought this soap dispenser after reading the reviews on the product. I agree that the concerns about quality are valid. I found that the threaded components of the reserve bottle and the pump insert could easily be damaged. This is surprising as the plastic components should be the easiest to make! I still like the way it matches the kitchen faucet but I am not putting any money on it surviving more than a year of continuous normal use.
5,Nice piece of work,"This book provides an excellent framework, set of tools, and methodology to make system design decisions based on analysis non-functional requirements and ""softgoals,"" often lacking in other software engineering methodologies and tools. In chapter 14 of the book, the authors provide extensions to the tools to model to analyze strategic rationale and business goals of a system, and apply them to a hypothetical business process re-engineering example. I believe that the authors here have presented a base set of tools and methodologies that have applications far beyond the field of software engineering as demonstrated in this chapter, and I look forward very much to see where this work will lead."
4,good read,The saga of Sister Mary Helen and friend Sister Eileen continues as Sister Mary Helen finds yet another body. Sister Mary Helen's talents aren't in the finding of the body (too convenient) but in the discovery of clues and the ability to get people to tell her things and the thoughtful putting together the information she has gathered. Her escapades are fun to read and makes a quick read as well. Sister Mary Helen is never boring.
1,Absolutely awful,"Pedestrian prose, inane dialogues often not advancing the plot, shallow characterizations, basic plotting allowing the reader to guess what's coming --although the characters deny it; to allow reader to fell smarter?-- and a dissappointing climax.Makes the DaVinci Code look like literature by comparison. Skipped through the last three hundred pages to see if it got any better. It didn't. Had bought her second book ""La Biblia de Barro"" at the same time, will not bother to even try it after looking through first few pages.Have not read any of her nonfiction books, perhaps they are better, I will not check them.This is the first time that I have considered a book such a waste of time and money that I have decided to write a negative review.The above applies to the Spanish edition, maybe the translator was able to improve the English version some"
2,Trying to cash in on DaVinci Code,"Navarro's attempt at a historical mistery tale simply fails. At first, the plot seems interesting and well conceived. However, as she starts jumping around historical periods, following the trace of the sheet with which the body of Christ was covered and on which the image of Christ miraculously appears, the plot goes astray. Too many characters, and very few of them are fully developed.She tries to cover too much in 500+ pages....Knights Templar, a couple of french kings, Constantinople....and so on. The book does not involve you in any way. Definitely not a page turner.....Not to ruin the book's ending, suffice it to say that one of the greatest misteries in history is resolved in an extremely simplistic manner.I originally bought the book because it is a great hit in libraries in Madrid, which is usually a decent indicator of how good a book is, but in this case, big dissapointment."
3,It's ok...,"I did like it... but i thought it was just much of the same, if you have read dan brown's books. I would recommend Matilde Assensi's Iacubus, or the Last Caton."
5,Buen ejemplo de un genre nuevo,"Se le gustó El codigo de Di Vinci, le qustará también La hermandad de la sábana santa.Tiene misterio y intriga, y mueve rapidamente.La autora es una periodista y tiene un ojo para las detalles mas interestantes."
5,Better than the most popular The Da Vinci code,"Julia Navarro is an experienced writer, very well known in Europe through her books about politics and as a journalist. Her recently discovered ability for novels is outstanding; this book ""La hermandad de sábana santa"" is an excellent and catching tale about religious mysteries and international intrigue, but it is more historically and geographically rigorous than The Da Vinci code."
2,Se repite la historia de los otros libros de Juilia Navarro. (Biblia de Barro y Sangre de los inocentes),"Cambia los personajes, pero la trama es la misma de sus otros libros. Predecible y poco original. Si leyó los otros, salteselo."
2,"Mejor su novela ""Dime quien soy""","Leí la novela ""Dime quien soy"" y quedé fascinada. Por eso quise leer más obras de Julia Navarro pero debo reconocer que me está costando mucho acabar ""La hermandad de la sábana santa"" ya que me parece muy lenta y con poca acción."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered Learn HTML on the Mac In a Weekend and I received the PC version of the book instead. I have the PC version of HTML books already, I though it would be great to have a book I could use from the Mac perspective."
4,Fun British Mystery,"I'm a fan of the classic British country-house mystery. I found Georgette Heyer's books recommended and decided to give them a try. I enjoyed this very much. This is the 3rd book in a short series featuring Scotland Yard Inspector Hannasyde. I've also read the 1st in the series, but not the 2nd. The tones of the two books are very different, and so are the mysteries - this is NOT a cookie-cutter series. Both books had good character development, and were good portrayals of the time and the class. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes the good, old-fashioned British mysteries.Note on Kindle formatting: I found no issues with Kindle fomatting."
2,Very disappointed,"I personally love this fragrance, unfortunately I think I might've bought a knock off! I have one at home and need no more than 3 sprays ( wrists, and neck) to last the wole day. My mom loved it and so I bought it for Christmas. It wears off very quickly and is not that potent. It's the exact same product except the one I have is from overstock, not too sure what the difference could be but it was very embarassing to give a gift that noticeably gave different results other than what was expected. I love Amazon and they've never disappointed me before, but this was totally unexpected."
1,I failed my paper,"This book has nothing to do with William Defoe. I failed my paper. She should have calld her book something else, because I didn't know until it was too late! I copied some stuff out of here and my teacher said I didn't even proofread. If you like William Defoe, you should see the movie Platoon. 'Nuf said."
4,How far we have fallen,"One does not have to read very far into this book to realize just how far we have fallen in our ability to communicate.In this age of instant connectedness the score in words, tex symbols - millions, communication - zero.I heard a person on NPR recently say that young people are writting more than ever. this may me true, but the substance of what they write in nil."
1,Stick with VHS!,"These films are all 5-star classics so surely they deserve better treatment than has been meted out here. The picture quality is appalling, the synchronisation poor, and the sound barely audible. Also since there are no extra features, the price being charged is ridiculously high as the 3 films could fit comfortably onto a single dual-layer disc."
3,Not that bad!,The video quality is NO WORSE then other films from the same era. The quality can be compared to the newly released Frankenstein. Comments about being transfered from video seem a bit harsh. If you are a Marx Brothers fan you will enjoy this set.
3,Question about Marx Brothers box,"I have not seen this presentation of the films, but question the reviews. I find that there is too much discrepancy between the reviews here and reviews for the individual films. In my experience Image Entertainment has always done a superior job with their DVD releases, including some of the best releases of silent films available-presumably more difficult source material than the Marx brothers films. I would appreciate further input from anyone in regards to the quality of these films on DVD, and apologize for posting this non-review."
4,A great bargain -- what a pair of classics!,"""Animal Crackers"" is hysterical, with classic bits you'll recognize. It's a must-see if only to know the foundations of Marx Brothers (and therefore American) humor. But look out for the bad acting and bad musical numbers. The best part is when Groucho interacts with Margaret Dumont. My favorite: the Captain Spaulding song.As for ""Duck Soup,"" it's the last third that's the classic part. If you're a comedy film buff, you simply must see this one. You'll recognize how this film had so much effect on so many others that followed. The hilarious skits don't have much to do with each other, but who cares? And it was nice to see the handsome Zeppo."
5,Must Have Classics For Any Marx Fan!,"I absolutely love my set, contrary to other reviews i've read on here, the quality is great, sound quality is great, and overall i am extremely satisfied with the price as these are hard to find on DVD. This is a must-have for any Marx Brothers Fan!"
5,Memorable Mozart,"It is always a joy to sink into the sumptuous sonorities of the Mozart Concerto for Flute and Harp, and this recording doesn't disappoint. Rarely do you find recordings of the Mozart flute concertos performed by not only virtuoso soloists, but also accompanied by a world class orchestra. Emmanuel Pahud performs the concertos with the orchestra in which he holds the position of Principal Flute. His tone is always bright, clear and focused and he plays with an absolutely effortless technique. Beautiful flute playing by a fine musician. As would be expected, the Berlin Philharmonic is flawless and Maestro Abbado treats the listener to beautifly shaped musical phrasing. This performance is definately contemporary in its sound and will not be mistaken for a period instrument performance. I you are a lover of Mozart, and especially the wind concertos, this album would be a fine addition to your collection."
5,"Mozart: Flute Concertos: No. 1 in G, K. 313; No 2 in D, K. 314; Concerto for Flute & Harp in C, K. 299","This is an excellent recording, as are all of Pahud's that I have. I highly recommend it."
4,Good workout tool when injured,"I purchased this when I got injured while training for a marathon. I am a petite female and it fits well, but I found the belt will cause me to chafe on my lower back when aqua jogging for more than an hour (I wear a bikini and wear this in the ocean). The strap is adjustable, so perhaps I need to make it more snug, otherwise I'll wear a rash guard to prevent future chafing. The material is of good quality and it has held up well with salt water. I tried aqua jogging without the belt and it's a lot harder and I tend to sink. I live in Hawaii, so I just hop in the ocean and aqua jog about 500 meters and back, so it's not as boring as if I were in a pool. I rinse it off afterwards and keep it in my car. I'm happy with my purchase and even though I'm starting to run again, I see the benefits of aqua jogging (especially when it's too hot to run)."
3,quality of aquajogger,I am using it almost daily and it is performing well. The only thing I will mention is that my previous jogger (which I cannot find) was widerander and fitted better so it stayed in place and did not try to ride up in deep[ water.The jogger was purchased at Amazon.
1,BAD QUALITY,I've had this product for such a short period of time and it has already shredded!. I would not recommend this product to anyone! I could not return this product because I used it. I feel it's a defective product.
5,Great start,"Aqua jogger is a great start to water exericise. It holds you up so you can jog, do jumping jacks, bicycle, and many other helpful stretches without the aftermath of pain as in land exercise."
5,Solid Book,Kobe Bryant is all Ready a Important Player but wait until a few years down the line His Best shall come.the Guy is a Good Balance of Talent&Flaw.He is gonna be Scary in years to Come.this Book brings all those Elements&More out.He has had to deal with alot of things On&Off the COurt but He is Headed for Something Special with His Career.the Sky is the Limit for Him.
3,Just solid book,This book was okey. I am a big Lakers and Kobe fan but most of the storys in this book i know about and the Lazenby did talk to mutch about his Bulls people.
2,The Smell but hears a recipe,I am not really impressed. I loved the powder but it makes me breakout so I opt for this. I did not know at the time it was mineral oil. The oil reminds me of water because its than. Dont be food by the color because thats dye. Just not worth it. Go to a market and get some amla or gooseberries then dry them out in the sun. get some coconut oil and put the amla in it on the stove on low heat for 2 hours wy...la Amla natural oil.
5,One of all-time best,"One of my favorite three or four albums ever. Combine the very best elements of the Beatles,Stones,Donovan, and maybe the Hollies and it might sound as good as this. A hard rocking psychedelic 60's masterpiece. Don't know about the mono vs. stereo debate, I don't own this cd, but have owned the LP for many years. BTW, the live version is also fantastic!"
4,Make sure you know which Snapper version you're getting,There are TWO versions of S.F. Sorrow that Snapper released on CD. The digipack is the STEREO mix; the jewel case Snapper is the MONO mix. Both are interesting in their own right.Snapper Digipack: StereoSnapper Jewel-case: Mono
2,Don't believe the hype,"The Pretty Things were always a second tier outfit, and this dated, overhyped dud shows why. Yes, it was an early rock ""opera"" and no doubt influential as a result, but looked at dispassionately as a piece of music, it's crap. The songwriting is silly and instantly forgettable, and the gritty, tough sound of earlier Pretty Things that generally mitigated their songwriting limitations is absent from this dull museum piece of 60s pretension. Save your pennies for remastered editions of The Who Sell Out and the great Kinks triumvirate of Face to Face, Something Else and Village Green Preservation Society. The Pretty Things are for barrel scrapers."
2,Unsatisfying,"I heard ""SF Sorrow is Born"" on satellite radio, found it catchy, and knowing what the album was, decided to order it.I've only listened to it once. Sounds to me like an homage to The Beatles, mostly stuck on ""Walrus"". Just doesn't do it for me."
4,Make sure you know which version you're getting,There are TWO versions of S.F. Sorrow that Snapper released on CD. The digipack is the STEREO mix; the jewel case Snapper is the MONO mix. Both are interesting in their own right.Snapper Digipack: StereoSnapper Jewel-case: Mono
1,"The worst Callas recording ever, It discredits her genius.","Callas is my idol. Her Norma and Tosca are without rivals. But this is her worst performance ever. I don't want anyone to hate her because she is so bad here that they will not buy any more of her great recording. She is also supported by a terrible cast in bad voice, and the mono sound is awful. Do not even think of buying this Callas' worst recording ever. Go for the Tosca and Lucia of 1955 and you will be much happier. Callas would have been able to surpass Nilsson if she recorded this in 1949, when she had the Wagnerian voice and killer high notes."
4,Turandot,Callas is magnificent in this early performance. She is accompanied and supported by a first rate cast; most notable is Eugenio Fernandi (a tenor whom she often chose to sing with). Fernandi brings extraordinary power and beauty to the character of Calaf. He was a tenor of the highest caliber and this performance provides a fine introduction to Fernandi's artistry.
1,Shameful Turandot on all accounts,"To start, Callas has no business singing Turandot. She had a shrill, colorless sound that is unacceptable in Puccini's passionate music. The title role belongs to Eva Marton, or Birgit Nilsson. The Liu here is bad as well. She sounds wirey and edgy. As for the tenor, he's even worst. All and all, a pathetic recording ( I returned it ). May I suggest the VHS tape with Domingo and Marton? It's visually splendid, and the singing is first class."
3,"Despite fine singing, mono sound disappoints","Callas fans will want to own this, but I cannot recommend it as a first Turandot. It is an opera of lush orchestration and complex ensembles more than of melodies, and the mono recording just can't handle it; the ear struggles to pick out the different parts, and at times it is impossible even to follow along in the libretto. The chorus in particular tends to disappear in quieter passages, of which there are many. This work cries out for a modern stereo recording."
2,Poor recording that never should have been made,"Callas, in 1957, did not have the big voice to sing Turandot; in 1949, yes; in 1957, no! Schwarzkopf as Liù is unidiomatic. The tenor is inept. Only Serafin's conducting saves this set. Callas is no Turandot on this recording. Just listen to Nilsson, Turner, and Dimitrova. EMI should have gone to Austria to look for Gertrud Grob Prandl, a hochdrammatisch sopran who had the chops to really sing Turandot and who did so frequently in Italy."

3,"Still blazing, but....","Disc One really delivers on the content that is expected of Sizzla. It also included several of his hit songs. However, disc two left me wondering what measurement was used for arriving at the ""Best of Sizzla."" In the end I was left feeling that the compilation was more a marketing strategy to get some of Sizzla's not so popular songs a hearing.Overall, it was still worth the cost since songs such as No White God, Black Woman and Child, Jah Blessing and Words of Devine delivered the goods."
5,Its been a long time coming...,"I especially love this compilation because it portrays Sizzla @ his best. I also love the fact that it includes tracks like Juvenile & Goodways, because it was very difficult to get those tracks without having to buy a mixed CD/TAPE. I highly recommend that you check out Sizzla Da Real Thing....THIS CD's off-the-hook! And here I thought that it couldn't get any better than Black Woman & Child! This youth's got raw talent!"
5,Wonderful quick read for the holidays,"A magical story of closure and redemption.A recovering drug addict, now a drug counselor, is stranded in a snowstorm away from his family during the holidays. Through the course of the night he experiences several flashbacks of his life, back to simpler times with his family and friends, revisiting times of warmth and companionship and bringing closure to his many regrets in life. By seeing a glimpse of what his life could have been, it is clear that the love of his family and friends is how he found redemption."
4,How to use the LAW well? Read this book.,"Though I have read the book 'To Bid or not to bid', I have found that I often count it wrongly. This book tells me how to use it a real situation. It is very helpful."
2,poor organization makes it hard to find doable observations,"The first problem with this book is that for the urban or suburban observer with less than giant binoculars, it is too hard to find objects that you will really have any luck with. You have to sort through long lists of 9th-magnitude star clusters to find anything that would really be visible. The second problem is that a large percentage of the objects listed are pretty dim and crummy open clusters, and in most cases it is extremely hard to tell whether you are seeing the cluster or not. The photos are no help, because they are all long photographic exposures taken through telescopes, nothing like what you actually see through binox."
5,This book is the leading reference on binocular astronomy,"Binoculars are a unique tool in the astronomers arsenal: using both eyes to scan the heavens improves the ""Eye-Brain"" signal-to-noise ratio, plus they are an intimate hand held device that doesn't intrude on human experience of enjoying the night sky.Harrington understands both the technical and esthetic value of binoculars, and communicates it extraordinarily well in this book."
1,"THIS BOOK IS USELESS, BORING, AND INACCURATE!","The main problem with this book is that it doesn't provide much more information that a 50 cent star map would. The illustrations are hard to read and the text is inaccurate. It is almost impossible to use the information to find objects of interest in the sky. I counted fourteen instances where the text says an object is in one constellation, but the map shows it in another! The writing is so dry and monotinous it will put you to sleep. It is obvious very little attention or interest went into compiling this trash."
5,Tilson Thomas remains a first choice in this music,"Superb ensemble playing, first rate recording and faithful remastering, and the inspired conducting of young Michael Tilson Thomas make this welcome reissue a first recommendation for this works. Don't hesitate if you are considering to purchase this generously filled 80min 50 sec cd."
2,not user friendly,Still can't get what I ordered it for --- indoor AND outdoor temp. Can get one or the other but not both.
2,"Difficult to figure out, and very poor customer service","I needed a second thermometer to work with my current system.I spent a week trying to contact Oregon Scientific's customer service department, where I was told to leave a message but my calls were never returned.I finally figured out on my own that this model would work with my current sensors, however, it is not easy to use, and the buttons are on the side so that each time you move the sensor you change a setting.My main complaint is with Oergon Scientific's customer service.This is the last time I will purchase from Oregon Scientific."
1,Worse Item I Ever Purchased,"This item has one thing going for it. It keeps great time! As for as the temperture inside and outside forget it. It hasn't worked from day one and I even had a teckie friend see if I was doing something wrong. I personally feel my money should be refunded or one that works sent to me.Linda Ann Baragar525 S Conway Rd # 154Orlando, FL 32807"
1,"Good operation, very poor sensor design and service","I've had this product for about two years and was generally pleased. But recently when I needed to replace the batteries in the sensor, I discovered that the very deeply recessed screws were ""frozen"" and I could not budge them with the very tiny screwdriver I needed. Certainly they could have designed the case to be more user friendly. I e-mailed the company describing my problem and asking for suggested solutions. I never got a response.I would not buy this product again."
2,"Remote temperature only, no remote humidity","To get remote humidity sensing, you need to buy another sensor. Also, the remote sensor and the base unit keep losing sync and I have to open up the remote sensor (removing 3 screws each time) and reset the unit. Lastly, to see the remote temperature AND the inside temp/humidity requires hitting a button the side 4 times; twice for remote sensors that I don't have."
1,Wireless weather station,"If you live in a warm weather climate, this is probably a good product. For those of us who live in the northern part of the country however, it doesn't stand the test. To be fair, it states in the directions that alkaline batteries will likely freeze below 20 degrees, but of course you need to purchase the product to find this out. The consumer has the option of purchasing lithium batteries, but they are harder to find. I would recommend this product"
4,"not perfect, but still good","works pretty well. I was hoping to mount it on the wall, but the battery compartment is also the pedestal behind it and there's not much you can do about that. It was meant to sit on a counter somewhere. I got 2 of these, one in the house, one in the garage. I tried to have them both use the same external sensor, but they don't seem to like sharing, so each external sensor can only send data to one console at a time."
1,Tried Two-Neither Worked,"I purchased this weather station needing information about the outside temperature from indoors. The indoor temperature information display worked fine, but it failed to communicate at all with the outdoor sensor. I even tried setting them side by side and changing brand new batteries when following the directions produced no reading. I returned the item and Amazon sent me a new unit at zero cost, to me, even covering the return shipping. The second unit communicated with the sensor for about 24 hours and then quit. Again the indoor information was displayed, but my need is for the outdoor information. The base unit and the sensor were placed less than 15 feet apart and within a direct line of sight through a sliding glass door. I'll be looking to a different manufacturer for a replacement. Amazon was great throughout the situation."
3,"Nice indoor unit, poor remote unit, insensive WWV radio","I am very mixed on this unit.The good:Although the LCD is not illuminated, it is very easy to read.The unit works well for displaying indoor temperature and humidity.The thermometer is within two degrees of a known accurate spirit thermometer (I have no reference to check the hygrometer against)The bad:It doesn't receive the signal from the outdoor remote very well -- and it was only 10 feet away through a patio door.It seldom receives the WWV time signal, even though it is about 2 feet away from an outer wall, which is a glass patio door. I have three other ""atomic"" clocks scattered throughout the house and they receive the WWV signal without problem.It would be nice:To be able to hang it on the wall, but the desk stand contains the batteries and is fixed in place."
1,Don't waster your money,"I have had a variety or Oregon Scientific equipment and they are either just fine or total pieces of junk. This one falls into the junk category. It won't pick up WWV to set the clock and it won't pick up the outdoor sender unit unless it is within a few feet (less than 10') of the base station. Also, the outdoor unit does not send humidity, for that you need to buy another sender unit. Finally, the base station does not display indoor and outdoor temps at the same time. It can do one or the other or it can sequence through all 4 temperatures: one on the base station and 3 sender units and by the way, it cycles through ALL 4 channels even if there is no sender units on a channel so most of the time you will be looking at dashed lines and waiting for an actual temp to show up. Junk, junk, junk."
1,Remote sensor stopped working after 1 day,1 - unit doesn't come with any batteries. Need 2 AA's & 2 AAA's2 - remote sensor only senses temperature - not humidity.3 - left units sitting on dining room table. By the next day the remote sensor has stopped working. (no red blink every 40 seconds). Tried new batteries / reset button = no effect.
1,Less than Pleased,"I expected the clock to be ""Self-Setting Atomic Clock"" capable, it is definately not. It is very difficult to set up and does not read the outside temperatures as advertised!! I am totally dissatisfied with this product and am going to throw it out in the garbage!!"
2,"Great idea, lame execution","The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it inspired me. It was a cute gift from my mom, but the paint colors are AWFUL. The brush it comes with is WAY too stiff. The stencils pictured on the box are not the ones it comes with. They could've used the book to SHOW designs rather than name ideas, but they didn't. I agree with the first poster. Go out and buy your own body paints and brushes and do it yourself. There is no white or black!? How can you mix pink?? Lavendar?? Soft pastel colors?? Come on makers... put some effort into your product."
5,best alternative gu mix so far..............,"Lavelle really shines on this mix in doing exactly what he does best, making the hairs stand up on yer neck. The first disc is a special moment in DJ mixes recorded period because it actually takes chances instead of simply trancing you into a coma, not to be disrespectful of the classic trance mixes that have been represented on global underground. Lavelle seems to actually shift todays version of a DJ mix back towards a musical journey ala brothers gonna work it out by the Chemical Brothers or Liam Howlett's Dirtchamber mix from 99.75% of this mix is absolutely flawless, even the breaks/prog disc 2. You can really tell maybe Lavelle has put more effort into his mix than previous gu djs because he actually uses some of his own production in the mix to astounding effect. If you've maybe grown a little weary of the usual trendy swooshing mix than this mix will restore your faith. Gracias, Mr. Lavelle."
5,Amazing that this hasn't sold as much as Sasha,"...This album feels dangerous in all the right places. Its sleazy the way Lawler wishes he was. It breaks like Adam Freeland. Its acidic the way Christopher Lawrence used to be and it has more implied sex than it has any right to. Most important it takes chances. They might not all payoff, but enough do. Did I mention it sounds great?This isn't all prog house of course. The head of Mo'Wax couldn't foreget his beat based roots. This is a mix. This is a set. And it works. Starts to finish.But maybe most important is that it was realesed by Global Underground. The label that was once the inovator, the leader. Lately GU has become too formulatic. This album doens't save them completely. It just brought the fun back...one more time.Essential!"
5,Lavelle Spins it up dark and funky,My lord... this CD was well worth the money I paid for it. James Lavelle really transcends the boundaries of modern electronica in this set. The album is a beautifully woven tapestry of dark breakbeats and house. It's so deliciously funky that after one listen you'll be dying for another taste.
5,Moving,This wonderful book with images of family moved me to tears and laughter page after page. If you are part of a family you will be moved and want to share it with members of your own family.
1,"Erroneous, Poorly Researched, Boring","I read this about a year ago... well, read most of it, and emailed the author asking for explanations about where she'd come up with certain 'facts' about the Ziegfeld Follies and Ziegfeld Girls. I never heard back. It was apparent to me that many things she wrote were simply lifted from other erroneous Ziegfeld accounts previously published. The author included only what would suit her premise.The author apparently knows little if anything about Ziegfeld and his ""Girls"" or his shows. And like the other reviewer said here, this book is beyond boring.There are many good books out there on Ziegfeld. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
3,I love Paris in the springtime.,"Esquivel is known nowadays as ""The King of Space Age Pop"", and has become a cult favorite for his quirky instrumental pop music. This particular album was recorded in January of 1958, right afterOther Worlds Other Soundswas completed. See, there was some recording time left over after they completed that album, so Esquivel quickly came up with some arrangements for another album, which was recorded in record time. Since it was done so quickly, the arrangements are a lot simpler than usual for Esquivel. The band is much smaller than he usually worked with, and the music is much less ""quirky"" than people have come to expect from Esquivel. Most of the tunes are either classical or Latin American, and they feature Esquivel himself on piano as the lead instrument. It is enjoyable enough, but it's not one of Esquivel's ""classic"" albums. The CD adds three bonus songs which happen to have the names of cities in their titles, and originally appeared on other albums."
5,Great Oil,"This is a great cooking oil,no flavor at all great for frying pork chops,chicken breast,hash browns,ect..No coconut flavor.I use this oil to replace my vegetable oil.I do use my favorite extra virgin coconut oil (Nutiva)as a supplement and for when i want coconut flavor,but i highly recommend this for when you want a smooth tasteless cooking oil.Will buy again!"
1,Ghastly,"Tried Nutiva coconut oil and it was delicious, but it didn't come in a gallon size. We then ordered Wilderness Family coconut oil. Hideous, ghastly is too mild too truly explain how awful the taste which was like old soap. The smell lingered in the kitchen for hours just from opening the gallon container. There is no way it could be used for cooking or for anything else. We are disputing the purchase with our credit card company since the Wilderness Family Co. won't give credit unless the product is ""defective"" which requires shipping back with the attendant cost. Since we tasted it when we got it, we are now afraid of catching some horrible disease from the product. Don't buy it."
4,A standard bearer,Absolute required reading if one is of the Theist or Atheist bent. A little less forceful for those of the Agnostic persuasion.If you read Plantinga or J.L Mackie then you may very well want to add La Croix.
5,Works as advertised,"My daughter's rear windshield had multiple breaks in it. The hardest part was finding them with a multimeter. The paint works very well, it's a bit tricky to mask off the tiny lines while crouched in the rear seat.Even if you are a bit sloppy with the paint, it will complete the circuit and the defroster will workInexpensive and easy fix."
1,Doesn't work - gimmick.,"Followed the directions exactly. Gave a full 24 hours to cure. Tested it after a light snowfall. Didn't fix anything. I would think the Permatex brand would put a quality product out. A waste of time and hard earned money. This rating system won't allow for zero stars, but that's what I give it!!"
5,Permatex 15067 Grid Repair,"The material worked great. The kit includes a ""tape"" material to put on both side edges of the area to be repaired, and the material is then applied to build up a thickness with three applications. I used regular scotch tape instead. The repair worked great. I fixed a tiny break in one of the grid lines, overlapping the area maybe 1/2"" on both sides of the break. I have 99% of the material left over, enough to do several repairs. I highly recommend this product to anyone contemplating repairing their window defogger/defroster grid on their car's rear window."
2,permatex grid repair,"May be OK for repair. I was trying to replace my long dead defogger grid, and the paint pops off as the masking is lifted. Expensive learning lesson."
3,cake tester,expensive but nice. was glad to find it on the internet. had tried all the stores in my area without success.
2,No texts AT ALL in either English OR German.,"This is a large selection of CDs of readings of famous German poetry, without ANY written insert to follow in English or German. I am a very beginning student of German. I love these poets. However, since there no way to read a translated text, or translate a German text, one must be 100% fluent, completely understanding spoken German, to get anything out of these CDs. I have a German speaking friend. I will give it as a gift as it is completely worthless to me. Pity. It would have been good to know that UP FRONT."
5,Cute book!,My daughter enjoyed this book. It was too easy for her age not a challenge to read at all. I would recommend for Pre K.
3,"fun car on flat surface, not carpet","Don't buy this car if you have any carpet, it gets stuck and won't move an inch. Otherwise the control is easy enough for our toddler to have learned."
5,Beautifully written argument,Mill argues his position in a compelling and heartfelt manner. He was a true progressive. Much of his argument is still applicable today.
3,GET THE ESSENTIAL INSTEAD,"The first six cuts were lifted off this for the Essential CD. Plus you get Copperhead Road, Six Days On The Road, and I Aint Never Satisfied. Skip this, get Essential instead."
2,lacking -- 2.5,"Small-town highschool teacher wants to make true the sex rumors about herself & newly-returned Hero when they were back in high school. There is one condition & that their affair be purely a fling b/c she's leaving for Oxford in next few months.This Myers' book was just blah for me. It started out ok with Hero & heroine showing how they had feelings for each other in high school & still do 10 years later. Then, the romance pretty much died out as they just had sex in different locations. The emotions that Hero & heroine seemed to have at the start of the book got pushed aside & wasn't expanded on as they went through their sexcapade. So, when they begin realizing they were really in love with each other & wanted more of a commitment, I was not convinced.Slightly recommended for the interesting sex locations but not for the romance."
5,TRACK LIST,Rick Broussard / Shadow ManTrack Title1. Wild Bayou Nights2. Man On The Moon3. Blue Texas Northern4. There Is No Song5. Don't Wind Up Alone6. Done Gone Wrong7. Shadow Man8. Love Me Truly9. Hall Of Pain10. The Boys11. Ghost House
4,Strtict version.,"in a few words i Bought the disc about oveerture 1812. Is the complete and original Tchaikovsky version, Choral & orchestral, the play is good not outstanding. Relative Rimski is regular, Reiner is the king about all Scherezade's recordings...can you be imaginate."
2,Not a Karajan Standard,"Though to this day I consider Karajan to be unsurpassed as a conductor, this is one of the few of his recordings than can be avoided. As others have pointed out, the strings are particularly in Scheherazade polished but in the overall I get the feeling that the ensemble was not able to get their usual synergy. It sounds as little pieces of music put together one after another instead of a whole work. For Scheherazade I seriously recommend trying Gergiev's, Reiner's, Mackerras's or Kondrashin's. As for the 1812, again, not bad but far from being the best around."
4,"65 minutes of awesome, 15 minutes of awful","The Scheherezade is still one of my favorite pieces - easy to listen to and it keeps your interest. It has more brass than a lot of classical pieces, and a catchy violin theme.Capriccio Italien bounces around the same way Scheherezade does, with a lot of nice melodies and a constantly changing tempo. Well executed and conducted, this piece makes me smile every time I hear it.Now, the stinker: the choir for the Ouverture Solennelle does a deplorable job. Anyone who praises this CD and doesn't mention this clearly has not actually listened to it. The orchestra is masterful as always, but the brass players are clearly out of their league near the finale. A fart covers up roses every time."
1,This is not a mount kit,"This product (SM5346) is a steel mount with no rubber bushings, not the mount KIT for Ford Probe GT or any other car. Does not look anything like the picture. I think the correct part is SM 5308, but not sure. Amazon's parts finder says NO for 5308 and Yes for 5346. Had to return it."
1,American Experience: Jimmy Carter,The DVD was biased and did not hold to any other biography or documented information that I have read/seen prior to this DVD. It seems to be a publicity promotion in an attempt to distort the reality's of the past. The DVD was well done (with the exception of it being based on history) and does offer an inside look into the private life of Mr. Carter. For me; I would like to have the real story and this DVD is anything but.
1,Pooped out after only 1 1/2 years!,"I bought this TV from Walmart in July 2007 for $298. Yesterday it began shutting off after it had been only for only five seconds or so. I called Emerson's tech. line and the woman with whom I spoke said she didn't know what was wrong, but that she had received other calls from EWL20D6 owners about this problem. I spoke with a local TV repairman and he said it sounded like the internal power supply and may cost $150 or so to fix. Naturally, the warranty has expired. I've owned other TVs for many years before they gave up the ghost - I think 1 1/2 years is quite early for a TV to start needing expensive repairs. Find another model."
5,A Real Norteno Classic,"This is the classic of classics by Ramon Ayala. Released in 1976 (1975 in Mexico), It remains as one of the favorite among fans. For some reason a song was omitted ""Me Tienes Loco"" an was replaced by ""El Disgusto""(Reason Unknown). But still with this change whoever has the original(Like I Do) you will notice the change in sound of the song."
4,Great,"I love Will Rogers tales of the west and horses. There is a reality about horses, their actions and antics that is refreshing in a modern world where most human-horse interaction is just looking at the beautiful creatures with admiration but no understanding."
4,"Great knives, slightly let down on the wooden block","Knives look great, though they seem lighter than I recall. Haven't got the chance to cut anything with them though.Was a little let down by the ""Made in Malaysia"" sticker on the block, and the stickers on the knife handles (which were peeling off slightly) which is the main reason I gave four instead of five stars."
3,Kind of Okay.....,"Well the picture actually exaggerates the actual look of the watch. There are diamonds on the sides of the dial, but not the entire stretch is embedded with diamonds. The sides are silver colored to make it look more appealing and the color is not as bright gold as you see in the picture. That being said, i expected a little more for the price i paid."
4,beautiful bracelet that comes with a clock,"this lovely piece of jewelry gets compliments, wears comfortably, and even keeps time. The simplicity of the lines and links are elegant. Now, I paid a steep discount which makes even nominal wear a good value for me, if it wears for a few years (and why not?) it is bargain booty."
3,Not as first thought,"I have just recieved this watch, and have quite a collection of mens watches. However i felt that this watch would be more for a lady than a man as the face is very small and no where near the size for a male.The crown is also so small that my fingers had a job to pull it out."
5,Good family DVDs,I purchased the Highway to Heaven DVDs because I like the story line of the Angel in human form helps people. The DVDs are good quality.
3,liked season one better so far,"We have not viewed all of the stories yet but found some of them to be a bit strange, and so far preferred the ones in season one."
1,This Stinks!,"If you own a TV Guardian that mutes the bad words, forget it working with Seasons 1 and 2 of Highway To Heaven. The Guardian needs Closed Captioning to work. Some episodes don't hevs swearing but that is not the norm. I gave 1 star because of No CC and edited Episodes and Swearing.And too expensive not to have Closed Captioning.What a pity."
5,Highway to Heaven,"Highway to Heaven series on DVD superb!! Highest rating for sure. Every story is mesermizing, with creative plot lines."
1,Very disappointing!!!!,This SUCKS!!!!! Because they do not have English subtitle/close captions for the hearing impaired. It is NOT right for not including close captions.
5,awesome,Great series for the entire family. Very inspirational and great stories. My whole family liked them. Some were even tear jerkers. For my family not for me of course. GOD bless you all.
1,Buyer Beware False Advertising,"The movie is great the one star is for the dvd.Just want to let everybody know this version doesnot have 2.35:1 aspect ratio, it's the same dulllooking 1:85:1 aspect ratio version. Come on Amazon."
2,The Angel Returns,"This film had a good plot, but the cast needed work and they have changed the fate of Mengele from reality."
5,Still a classic,"Saw this one on television. Cloning, like time travel, is a subject that interests me. And in this movie Cloning which at the time was just Sci-Fi is well worth thinking about in its moral terms.Gregory Peck plays Mengele as the ultimate fiend. Sir Lawrence Olivier Plays the nazi Hunter superbly. His jail house confrontation with the Mair of Majdanek shows terms perfectly.It is a stuggle of amoral Science harnessed for evil with morality. Relevent to this day."
1,"The Film is Great!!! But, Do Not Buy This ""New"" Version...","Do not buy this supposedly new, anamorphic version. It is not, and the quality is terrible. I think they slipped the old cruddy DVD version in this ""new"" case. The region free Bluray looks like it is probably of good quality."
1,Don't Buy,"This is the same non-anamorphic disc as before, but repackaged. Which makes Lionsgate liars, because the back of the insert claims it is ""16x9"". Thanks for taking my money, scumbags."
1,Bad Brazil Boys,"I agree with previous reviews. I just viewed this ""new"" DVD of The Boys From Brazil and the quality is terrible. Some of the footage even looks out of focus and I thought my TV was out of adjustment; it wasn't. It's the DVD. Not worth even the cheap $9.98."
4,The Boys From Brazil.,"A good ""what if"" movie, though an unusual role for the great gregory Peck! A very good cast, too ... James Mason, etc."
3,Boys From Brazil a Thriller,"When you get 3 titans of the acting profession going head to head, it's a guaranteed classic. Gregory Peck in a rare ""bad guy"" roll shows why he's one of the greats. Hard to imagine that Atticus Finch would have approved of Dr. Mengele's activities. While Laurence Olivier, former bad guy in Spartacus and Marathon Man (Is it Safe?), plays the ""good guy"" Nazi hunter. James Mason has less scenes then the previously mentioned, but always has a screen presense. But is surely is the conflict between hated enemies Peck and Olivier that runs the movie. Also, good taking on the Nazi's is a common theme (Indiana Jones, etc.). Even the young man that portrays the Hitler clones does an exceptional job as, although he looks identical, must have many, many accents as the Hitler clones are spread world wide, even in the US. Can feeble old Nazi hunter Olivier triumph over the ultimate evil of Gregory Peck?"
5,Great movie and less expensive in the UK.,"Following Mr. Grimm's advice I ordered ""The Boys From Brazil"" through Amazon in the UK and it was much cheaper and the quality is superb!! I have to say that the regular DVD copy is terrible compared to the Blu Ray copy. Thanks agin for the cost savings Mr. Grimm and a great video of this outstanding movie."
5,Scary movie! Scary Book!,"Ira Levin is a completely underrated horror writer, which is too bad as the only horror writer who can equal him in tight plotting and outre situations is Dan Simmons. The movie _Boys from Brazil_ is based upon Levin's book of the same name and it is fantastic. The twist is utterly fantastic and rather convincing. The only part of this movie that grates somewhat is the fact that Neither Gregory Peck, as Josef Mengele or James Mason as another senior Nazi can do a convincing German accent. On the other hand listening to their voices in their scenes together and their masterful delivery of chilling lines makes up for this small discrepancy. Check out the book and then get the movie. You won't be disappointed with either."
4,intriguing,wasnt sure at first but heard enough about this movie from friends and had to get it to find out what the hype was about.you have to use your imagination and just go with it.i enjoyed it alot.
4,Top Of the Shelf DVD,"Very good movie with top actors like Gregory Peck and Sir Laurence Olivier together probably for the first and last time, only problem which i felt was otherwise a very good movie that it had no subtitle option. but definately a must for your collection.Hariharan VenkateshNew DelhiIndia"
3,it is what it is...,"Gregory Peck as a Nazi, what more can I say. not as good as I remember, but not bad. James Mason (as a Nazi), and Sir Lawrence Olivier as a Nazi hunter. they don't make them like this anymore. cheap. why not?"
3,solid but silly thriller with its heart in the right place,"a fun melodrama with gregory peck playing the bad guy, facing off against laurence olivier as a wiesenthal-inspired nazi hunter. while history has proven out the absurdities of the plot line, it is still a good thriller."
3,The Boys Needed A Better Screenplay,"Sometimes movies made from books are good, other times they are not. This is one of those ""nots"".The movie takes too long to get the ball rolling, action-wise, and the ending seemed too quick, too contrived.It could have used a better screenplay."
4,Oddity...,"OK, I enjoyed this film. The plot is erie. The concepts of genetic engineering is looked at a from a moral view. Small dark haired boys raised in the right enviroment could make another Hitler? A strange film, but that is the plot. After the war hitler is cloned and surviving Nazi war Criminals are attempting to recreate their leader. it is supprisingly well done, but might seem a little slow and haokey to modern audiences (Orange blood? 70's clothes, etc.) but good stuff over al... and yes, that is a young Stve Gutenburg in the beguining."
1,A pig in a poke,"Don't buy into the packaging's claim that this is remastered for 16:9 HDTV sets. It's the same cruddy, low-resolution copy that Artisan used to distribute."
4,This import BD is far cheaper on Amazon UK,"It bewilders me how Amazon can expect to sell an import Blu-ray and expect it to sell for the over $30 (as of Aug. 30, 2009) it is advertised here when the exact same Blu-ray is available for direct order from Amazin UK.I ordered mine from Amazon UK and assume that those selling this Blu-ray at the ridiculous price are counting on people not being able to click on the United Kingdom link at the bottom of the page.The movie is great and the Blu-ray is fabulous but make sure that you check Amazon UK and Amazon France etc before handing your money over for an imported Blu-ray. Even with the international shipping it is still much, much cheaper on Amazon UK."
2,Beware AVID/ITC VHS version in EP speed,"I saw this movie back in the 1970s, and although it admittedly is not on my list of ""Greatest Films of All Time"", I did enjoy it and wanted a copy of it since it doesn't get played on TV much anymore.After reading all the negative reviews of the DVD issue, I decided to play it safe and order it in VHS. Unfortunately, the version I got, put out by ITC through AVID Home Entertainment and Live Home Video Inc. (all these names were on the video slipcase) was recorded in ""SLP"" (otherwise know as EP) speed instead of SP like most VHS tapes are. As a result, the picture and sound quality are poor - the images are fuzzy at the edges and the stereo separation is barely noticeable, and I even tried listening with headphones! Hopefully this movie will be re-done in regular DVD since I don't own a Blu-Ray and won't buy one just for this movie..."
5,Chilling Thriller,"An all star cast, headed up by Gregory Peck and Lawrence Olivier, makes this a great thriller about the cloning of Hitler. As others noted at the time this movie was made cloning was off in the future but as science makes science fiction reality, it makes the movie more powerful in having a basis for ""What If?""The DVD itself was okay in terms of picture quality and played well on my DVD Player and I did not find that it detracted from the movie.Great acting, great story great movie."
4,The Boys from Brazil,The DVD came on time and it was not damaged. The movie is an old one but is a very good classic.
5,Great Movie from the 70's,This is a very interesting and well acted movie. It has a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck are absolutely wonderful in this movie.
4,Good 70's Thriller with Olivier and Peck,"The DVD is ok, but other than that, this is a very good film concerning the pursuit by an aging Nazi hunter, played by Laurence Olivier, of Dr. Josef Mengele, played by Gregory Peck. Good performances and a solid story concerning Mengele's attempt to create clones of Hitler and bring about the return of the Third Reich."
3,Robert Mitchum as Joseph Meingala,"This was a weird, weird movie.Nazi scientists start meddeling with cellular science, and devise a way to build 'super race'. Thousands little dark haired Hitler clones. Made even scarier by the advances that are being made in genetic engineering today"
1,Bach on the Guitar,"Barrueco is adding a lot of extra notes to the original music score and i believe that the audience should listen those pieces as it is in the original score, eventhough this music has been transcribed for another instrument. We know that it could be nice to add some notes if you are looking for some extra color but in this case, it is to much. I believe that it is not good for the audience because they are getting something that it is not by Bach. Also, the CD cover is not very atractive and the picture is not good."
4,VERY GOOD CRIB SET,"THIS ITEM IS OF GOOD QUALITY, COMFORT, AND THE PICTURE OR DESIGN IS VERY DETAIL.IT COULD BE USE BOTH FOR BOY OR GIRL, AND IT FEELS GOOD TO THE SKIN. VERY GOOD TESTURE.ONCE YOU START WASHING HAVE NO FEAR, NO EVIDENCE OF PICTURE FADING."
5,Baby's Favorite!,"When I was pregnant I shopped around for the best bedding for the best price. I knew I would be doing the theme of my baby's room in moons and stars, so this was perfect. It also has all kinds of accessories to match (mobile, lamps, wall borders and wall stick ups, etc), you just have to browse the net a little to find them. My son LOVES to look at the bright colors and the black-and-white snoopys. Primary colors are what babies are most attracted to from birth, so the snoopy theme was perfect. He is 5 months now and stares at snoopy for up to an hour! He especially loves the snoopy murals his mommy painted on the walls for him. Altogether a great set to go with!"
3,not her best,I read this because it was written by Elizabeth Peters but it's one of her early works and not as well written... it's ok but some of it is just so implausible... a beach read...
4,Intriguing,This story pulls you in and keeps you guessing throughout the book. Not the most interesting characters but it has an intriguing story line.
4,Good read. I love gothic mysteries and I enjoyed this one.,The reason I like gothic mysteries is because mysteries are my favorites and the gothics usually don't have more lust and explicit sex than mystery. If I wanted to read about lust and explicit sex I would buy a love story. Most authors now can't seem to just write a mystery.
4,Beauty and the Beast,"An interesting story, but I would have liked to see more of a mystery. Also more interplay between the ""Beauty"" and the ""Beast."" Nothing risque, simply more romance."
3,"This book is good, but not great.","Barbara Michaels seems to have no new ideas, if you've read a couple of her books, there is no need to read this one, it is a variation of all her other books."
5,"guidebooks, yoga","As a new yoga student, I find Yee's work helpful and most instructive. He gives rationale behind each of the poses, and offers a bit of coaching for the neophyte as to how to align and anticipate each asana. I feel it best to not rush through this book, but to savor it, page by page. Why would anyone want to hurry up through such a great 'body feel good experience' as yoga has turned out to be? The book is hefty, well done, and it has many, many illustrations, which are easy to follow. This is also another mat companion for your personal 'time on the mat'."
4,I would buy a DVD instead of a book,"I bought this as a Yoga beginner, but I would be able to choose one more time, I would rather to buy a DVD instead of a book. It's a good book, detailize every single post as well as the important points, however, to just follow is hard cause you're doing the post, and you need the next post, DVD would solve this problem. But don't get me wrong, it's a good book."
3,New Pathfinder dvd is missing footage,"Truely a classic of the Spanish 70's cinema, but the new dvd has been sourced from a cut print and is missing three scenes and part of a fourth. Be advised that the complete film was released in the UK, but that VHS release is out of print.The framing is indeed off...off centered to the left and overmatted top and bottom. LBX scenes from the Spanish print included in the extras confirm this.Very sloppy work from Pathfinder. Worth a rental if you've never seen it."
1,Horrid Transfer!,"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release A Bell From Hell, She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound. This is in reference to the Pathfinder Home Entertainment DVD release. The Movie gets 3 to 4 stars from me personally."
2,not what i expected,"The sneaker wasnt what I expected at all. Material was not the best and after deciding to return it, it ended up costing me just to get it back to the company. Wasnt please at all."
3,"This Ain't ""One More From The Road""....","This album is not even close to the classic live album ""One More From The Road"" (the 2 cd deluxe edition is outstanding). So, if you do not own that album, get it now and pass on this. If you're a die-hard Skynyrd fan (your not a fan if you can't even spell Lynyrd Skynyrd) this album is a pretty decent listen. The band plays fairly well and Rossington's guitar is in fine form. Heck, you might even play this 3 or 4 times. After that, however, you'll just keep goin' back for Ronnie and the real thing. Bring on those mules!!!!"
2,Not a great choice...,"I found the book to be rather difficult to use. I felt that much more of the book could have been devoted to personality tests and relating them to your career. The tests that are included in the book are often shortened versions of what is available on the internet. If you are not very good at evaluating yourself this may be helpful, but I don't recommend it. The book plugs an on-line test at keirseycampbell.com repeatedly, even offering a discount coupon. I would say, just go straight to the website and take the tests there. They are much more comprehensive and take much less time."
1,immediate return,"This item is a joke! The dog came running to see what was going on then barked at it. Tried different placement, adjustments, etc. Kind feel like someone was laughing at me saying ""sucker""!"
3,Order Big!,"I ordered two women's shirts from G-III. Both items were too small. I wear a women's small, and most of the time they are big on me. I ordered the hoodie in a medium so it would be big enough to wear over another shirt. However, it was so small I could barely even get it on. I believe the sizes listed are Junior sizes, which run MUCH smaller than women's sizes. The hoodie was very nice, just too small. If you order this hoodie, I would suggest ordering a size or two bigger than you normally would."
2,NIGHT OF INSANITY,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE DVD, WHILE MOST OF THE GIRLS ARE ATTRACTIVE AND ATHLETIC, VERY FEW KNOW EVEN THE MOST BASIC WRESTLING, AND THEIR IN RING BEHAVIOR MADE THE WWE LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARERAZORBACK FAN"
3,"great opera, not a very good version","Teresa Stratas is perfect, Boulez makes his own interpretation. Is not the best. The three acts (completed by another guy) is less effective and less real. I wont recommend this version at all. Christine's remain the very best.Martin"
4,This ones mislabled,"Actually, this book is the Adventure ""Bloody ol' Muddy"" for Deadlands: Weird West. It's a pretty fun one, takes place on the Mississippi, I think St. Louis. It's as good as any other Deadlands adventure. Hope this helps."
1,Not durable!,"Purchased this for my 6yr old, she always wanted a flip top watch. This watch had a flip top which included lip gloss which I thought she would love. Well she did, but the watch broke 2 weeks after she got it. The band where you adjust the watch to your arm came apart. Poorly made."
3,Koans for people who do not know about koans,"I was entertained by this great little book. I had a good time picking a selection at random and letting it soak in for a while. I am a Zen student, and no stranger to koans. I also grew up Christian so I am no stranger to the teachings of Jesus, either. I was excited to see these blend in a fun way. This is not a traditional Zen collection, but a cute assembly of things Jesus should have said.Personally, I was hoping for more of a chapter and verse style of selection. That way I could go into it deeper if I wanted to track down an inspiration. This was not the case, and I was often left wondering whether a selection was actually scriptural or just an inspiration. There was a chapter or two that read like an email chain letter inspirational, but the overall impression is that the author is very creative and uses some sharp wit to bring out the spirit of Jesus. Who says the spirit is confined to his words, anyway?"
1,Wrong Item,"Ordered one and got the wrong item, the usa female plug looked like India female plug,there is no way the us pin from us devices would enter in this female part.Returned the item to Amazon returns center."
2,Didn't work by itself,"I was disappointed with this purchase because it did not work by itself with the outlets in Bandra, India. Luckily, there was someone else who had the other component needed for this adaptor to work, but make sure you know this is what you need, or look for a comprehensive adapter pack."
4,Pretty good lil doo-dad,"Only trouble I had was with the weight of having it and a converter having to be plugged in together. They were a little on the heavy side. Otherwise, it worked really well. I had no trouble with it charging my phone and digital video/photo recorder. Couldn't believe it was only about three bucks!"
5,Works and got to me in good time,"I needed an adapter a few days before a trip to India, and couldn't find one in any stores. I ordered this online, next day delivery; it arrived promptly; and it kept all my equipment charged up and working throughout my trip."
3,name of item is incorrect,"item name is: ""International Plug Adapter USA Female to India 16 Amp Grounded BS546 Male PlugSold by: Great Elect"", however the item is stamped ""10 amps"". There are many similar adapters for sale online that are 10 amps. I bought this one because it was supposedly 16 amps."
5,India Experience,Received the adapter quickly from sender. As was my first trip to India I wasn't sure what to expect. The product delivered exactly as it should.
1,didn't last even a month,I thought I would get something from US for my next trip to India..but there it didn't last more than couple of weeks. It just snapped up one day. It is better to get something from India (both are made in china) which is much cheaper - INR 20 compared to USD3-4
4,weird,"something seems to be weird here! ""Or So It S eems"" is by DUET EMMO (Wire/Daniel Miller project) and NOT by JASEN EMMONS (whoever this is, sorry). As DUET EMMO are on ""mute"" and this CD isn't, it seems risky ordering it as one might get a Jasesn Emmons CD in return..... hope it will be fixed soon!"
4,"Chop-, Shoot-, and Blow-up Everyone!","At first, I was really self-consious about liking this game so much, but once I saw how well-received it was, I felt better. I just wish it wouldn't erase my saved game every 5th or 6th time I attempt to change levels. (I've tried 6 seperate copies, erasing all SOE data each time, but they all do it. It must be in the programming)."
4,Great Buy,"Rockstar really put some effort into making this game not ""be bad"". I can see how the PS2 version was lackluster, especially at a ... price tag. not delivering on the promises made, but those issues have been corrected in the XBOX version. The environments are large and interactive, with a large selection of weapons, and fairly intuitive game mechanics. With the addition of multiplayer, both coop and deathmatch, and at the super low debut price, it suddenly becomes a steal of a game."
4,Not as bad as they say...,"Before i go any farther,completly disregard all of the comments you read about the ps2 version. A good portion of why that versiion was so shallow was the lack of multiplayer. That problem is fixed in this version. Although this certainly isn't the greatest game ever, it is always fun for an hour at a time, and for that reason it is worth at least trying."
4,fun for the whole fmaily.. well maybe not,"I have the ps2 version and had a blast. The story mode is so-so, go from mision to mission and your having fun shooting maiming and destroying.The real fun though is rampage mode. In ramapge mode your given a amount of time and you go on a rampage. You exted time and get points by killing and destroying things. Killing in mellee combat gets you more time and points than a ranged weapon will. This is one of the best ways to blow off some time, I see it sort of like a fighting game in this repsect. It's something you can put in for 10 minutes here and there while your waiting for to leave, or before a show, or for someone to get ready so you can go.When it comes down to it what better way is there to spend time than to grab a mini-gun and blow someone into bloody chunks pick up their arm and beat their friends to death with it.(chest cavities and heads are fun too) This is a seriously over the top violent/gore game parents be warned."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I hope my title is off, really. They are adding multiplayer, which may be the closest anyone gets to GTA multi for a long while--thanks PS2, you bixatch. There was talk of the missions being redone so as to not be so monotonous, as well. I'm also curious to see how this one ports to XBOX. The key word there is 'port', as in 'hardly ever any good.' For the price of a CD, I may try it again, though I strongly urge you to wait for the gamespot.com or ign.com review before you pick this up. Better to be safe...(ends with an adage and an elipsis, but why?)"
4,Are you kidding me?,"The PS2 Version------Ok, they say this game is very controversial...far from it. U need an id to buy it (well u did at one point) no need 4 that. They should have done that to the GTA series, now thats a baaad game All the violence is cartoon...BORING. Cartoon heads flying off is nothing compared to gore like SOF 1&2. If you want to waste some money for a quick laugh...buy it. That guy is right, it is good for playing 10 minutes here and there...but who wants to waste money to do that? If ur smart, u wont buy this game-trust me"
2,"not as good as GTA 3 , but it fun","this game is cool that first , i have this game on ps2 and i have a xbox . in this game you can go and beat someone to death it fun and cool at first . the mission ... you may have to do the mission over and over and over again this will happen lot. the soundtrack ... . you play in a mall , city hall and more . the people who will enjoy this the most are people who aren't allowed to go in to a store to buy it."
3,Not a bad way to spend 20 bucks.,"Let me start off by saying the whole over the top violence and gore thing is just a marketing technique to generate more attention and controversy toward State of Emergency. It's like one long insane Ichy and Scratchy cartoon. The blood and gore is also optional so a wider audience can play. Basicaly you just run around and create a tremendous amount of havoc. While it can get boring it is actualy pretty entertaining and addictive. I reccomend you stay clear of Revolution mode and dive right into the Chaos mode. Revolution mode is a bunch of boring missions that take place in the riots, while chaos is more of an arcade style beat em up that you take place in. All in all you can't go too wrong buying this game. It is only 20 bucks and if nothing more it will at least entertain you for a couple of days. I suggest you rent it first and see how interested you still are when you have to return it, then you can properly determine whether or not it's worth a purchase."
2,Only fun at first,"OK, when you first get this game it seems pretty fun because you haven't played very many missions, but after about 5 missions you realize that every mission is the same. The Chaos mode is pretty fun except that mode is so easy to beat. You can beat the four levels in 3 hours. The revoution mode takes a long time to beat, but every mission is the same and it gets really boring."
5,The Raft,Great Story.......could not put down until finished. Would recommend to teenagers thru WWII veterans. I heard they are making a movie....hope that is true
5,You'll think twice before breaking the law,"The great ""Banned From Television"" series continues with this 4th installment. This time all of the footage is inside prison walls, you will see a murder, deadly riots, hostage situations on prison ground, and much more! Unfortunatley this video has not yet been released on DVD format, if you would like it to be please sign the ""Banned From Television: The Prison Files"" petition by logging on to www.petitiononline.com/BILLYF (CAPS LOCK MUST BE ON WHEN TYPING ""BILLYF"")"
5,Great CD; For all Genesis lovers: A MUST HAVE!!,"This is a GREAT cd! I listen to it all the time and I know almost all the lyrics by heart. This is Genesis at their best. ""Dance on a Volcano"", ""Ripples"", and ""Squonk"" are excellent songs. For all those Genesis fans out there, I recommend this cd, 100%! Don't hesitate in ordering this one today!"
4,Phil Collins wasn't in command yet...,"The band stayed pretty insecure after Gabriel's departure. So, at least here, they were a BAND, and not a Collins's backup band. It's obvious that Genesis Gabriel-era's records are easily better than this, but it's undeniable the quality of some tunes here, particullary ""Entangled"" (a must have for Genesis's fans), ""Squonk"" and ""Ripples"". Unfortunately, cuts like the title-track and ""Robbery, Assault and Battery"" gave us a clue of the future."
5,Great album much more better on hybrid SACD.,"For those who already know and have this album don't hesitate to buy this new version on hybrid SACD.Even on a regular CD player the sound is amazing much more details and clarity. Also the DVD bonus are very good and interesting. Ray Shulman (from Gentle Giant) made all the DVD authoring, it's great to see his name along the credit with this long time contemporary band. Probably with Wind and Wuthering, and Selling England by the Pound their finest musically effort. You will apreciate this piece of art. Go for this version even if it's more expensive then the regular.Hybrid SACD are superior then CD, again even on regular player."
5,One of their best,"Genesis certainly didn't suffer as a group just because Peter Gabriel left, as this album shows. Each track is almost an epic in itself, with some wonderful instrumental breaks which have almost classical overtones. The lyrics have an almost mystical, magical and whimsical feel, in typical Genesis style. I know their later albums got a bit of a bum-rap for being more ""poppish"", but this album is true to their prog-rock past. It is certainly a must-have for all of their fans."
5,Good old stuff,"I bought this cd after a chance hearing of 'Squonk'. I thought the song very cool and refeshing since I'd never heard it before. And, being Genesis, I also figured it would be an excellent all-around disc as well. I was not wrong. Of course, there is your token duds ('Dancing on a Volcano' and 'Robbery Assault & Battery'), but 'Entangled', 'Squonk', 'Ripples', and 'A Trick of the Tail' are great. Very good music to relax to with the lights dimmed. This is my first Genesis album, and I am looking forward to discovering more of their most excellent 70's stuff. I good change to when music was real and not canned and pre-packaged for the consumers the way it, unfortunately, is now."
1,way too much compression,"I am an old fan of Genesis from way back, but I have to say that this re-mixed version of A trick of the Tail is one that I get no pleasure at all in listening to.I am speaking about the SACD layer only as that is why I bought this disc! I have many other SACD recordings and take great pleasure in rediscovering emotions through them, but I find this mix extremely lacking in bass, and the recording completely saturated. Not at all as how I remember the original.A very disappointing re-mix of a super album."
3,The 1994 Definitive reissues are still the Definitive versions.,"Listen to the over the top saturation and additional reverb and treble added to these Rhino mixes before you decide to unload your old Atco or 1994 Definitive remastered versions of Genesis albums in order to be replaced by these Rhino reissues.Rhino apparently felt they needed to fix something that was not broken. They 'fixed' it alright. They fixed it so that it is overly loud and almost unlistenable to any long time Genesis fan who is familiar with how these albums should actually sound.The saving grace is the bonus DVD with the surround mix of the album, the videos from the album and the awesome Genesis Live 1976 concert footage.Buy it for the DVD, but not if you're just looking for a better remaster of the original album. Because the 94 reissues still sound best."
4,Pretty Good,A Trick Of The Tail was the first album of the Genesis middle period (1976-1978) when the band was climaxing thier Prog Rock sound and beggining thier Pop Rock sound and its pretty good even without Peter. Tony adds to his synth arsenal and Phil provides a wistle on the opening track and a chime on Mad Man Moon and interesting drumming (like bongos) on Los Endos keeping the music interesting. The only drawbacks are that the mostly instrumental Los Endos (im surprised some people call it an instrumental) lifts lyrics from Suppers Ready at the end of the song and the title track is forgettable.
4,Classic,"With the departure of Peter Gabriel many thought Genesis was in trouble. They weren't. As the opener ""Dance On A Volcano"" shows Genesis were in top form, creating an instant classic. ""Entangled"" flows smoothly along with ""Squonk"", a very interesting number. Phil Collins voice is superb, along with stunning guitar from Hackett and bass from Rutherford. Tony Bank's keeys are off the hook as usual, and the songs he contributes are all of high quality. The album closes with ""Los Endos"", a nice little summary of the album. Overall, the album is full of high exciting points, and only seldomly, are there lows. This is a must have for any Genesis fan."
2,Hmm...,"I don't know if I can say much about this album. I can't say I liked it really, but it wasn't exactly bad. Los Endos was cool. Dance On A Volcano, Ripples, Squonk, and the title track were promising. But everything else was kind of boring. At least Gabriel was gone. He's much better singer as a solo artist than with Genesis."
2,Peter! Please come back!,"I will admit that Peter Gabriel did not hold all of Genesis' talent within his own hands -- all of the members contributed on all of their pre Lamb Lies Down on Broadway albums. With this being said, this album is a cheap ripoff of Peter Gabriel's Genesis. The only reason this album deserves more than one star is because it at least makes you remember how good Genesis once was by rehashing old ideas and Phil Collins' blatant copying of Gabriel's singing style. If you are a true Genesis fan and already have all of the albums featuring Gabriel's unique focus and genius, I suggest you explore Gabriel's body of solo work before wasting any money on this album."
2,"Boring, boring, boring...","Doing this pseudo-inteliigent music, Genesis made a bad album, much worse than ""Selling ENgland by the Pound"", which is a classic. It's boring, slow, indulgent. Worthless."
5,THE ONLY GENESIS ISLAND DISC,IF YOU WERE ON A DESERT ISLAND ...THIS WOULD BE MY ONLY GENESIS CD ALLOWED......FOR THAT MATTER.....IT WOULD BE IN MY TOP TEN ISLAND DISC FOR THE RECORD..............I KNOW PETER GABRIEL IS GONE.....BUT YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW IT........THE SONGS ARE CAPTIVATING.............YOU MUST LISTEN ...START TO FINISH............YOU WILL GET IT THEN!!!!!!!!!!!...
4,I almost give 5 stars,"Why i do not give 5 stars ?- I wish I could enjoy a completed cinema show video.. WITHOUT CHARLIE CHAPLIN movie..- I wish I could enjoy a completed super's ready videw.. WITHOUT THE WAR PLANE..Related SACD and DTS 96/24, I love the sound quality.. I'm thinking to purchase the SACD Duke Album."
2,"They Should Call It ""2008 Version""","I've been a big Genesis fan for ages, and ""Trick"" has always been one of my favorites. I was recently in Japan on tour and was very excited to pick up the new 'remastered' version. But I was shocked when I heard it. This is not just a sonic upgrade, it is a completely new mix,. And frankly, it is not as good a mix as the original. Among the many changes, the keyboards are not loud enough, a noticeable difference. On top of that, it seems some of the vocals have actually been re-cut, which is frustrating to listen to. If they wanted to do all this tweaking they should have characterized this release differently, called it ""New 2008 Version"" or something... The word 'remaster' is misleading.This almost reminds me of the spiffed-up new versions of the original Stars Wars trilogy. A big disappointment. Look for the earlier 'definitive edition remaster' version from 1994. 2 stars because it's still a classic."
2,Too much compression,"I'm a huge fan and have an outstanding system. This SACD/DVD-A will disappoint if you understand what breathing is when it comes to audio. Someone got overzealous with a compressor and made the vocal so bright that there are times when the music is gated in order to make way for it. If you want to hear what surround is capable of, purchase any Porcupine Tree disk or pick up the first Crowded House disk. Measure for measure, this disk is great if you are a die hard fan, but overdubbed concert footage and poorly engineered productions don't make up for what you can get from the first stereo remaster even if it was only at CD sampling rates."
2,Annoying,"Ok, the music is great and sounds just like I expected, BUT once again (like the Duke CD/DVD) the concert footage is poorly remastered! The audio track does NOT match the video...Phil sings, but his vocals arrive a 'touch' late. Arrrgh! Same annoying problem on the 'enhanced' Duke 1980 concert footage.I have the VHS of that Trick of the Tail 1976 concert, and the audio is spot on. Also, the interviews on this DVD are perfect soundtrack-wise, so what's up with the concert audio? Is it just me? I bought the CD/DVD primarily for the incredible Glasgow '76 concert footage, but feel frustrated. Any comments? Help?"
3,A Mixed Bag,"This is the first album after Peter Gabriel was replaced by Phil Collins,with predictably mixed results:on the one hand,the band musically is as sharp as ever,retaining thier knack for sweeping,baroque arrangements(""Dance On A Volcano"",""Mad Man Moon""),while acheiving an unprescedented fluidity and forward momentum on tracks like ""Entangled"" and the instrumental section of ""Ripples"".On the other hand,the lyrics suffer greatly without Gabriel's trademark wit and theatrical flair,coming off as a bit second-hand and rote.Collins,for his part,holds his own in the vocal department,ably keeping up with the multi-octive demands of the material.His vocals are especially pretty on ""Ripples"" and ""Entangled"".Neither the disaster longtime fans feared,nor the triumph they hoped for,""A Trick Of The Tail"" is simply a faily solid transitional album."
1,A tale that does the trick,"This is one of my favourite albums from Genesis. Songs are typically progressive and the melodies are cativating. Instrumental playing is the finest. The lyrics tell stories which reach our feelings. Phil Collins sings soft and blends into the melody and instruments, never fighting. Immediate recommendations for listening are Mad Man Moon keyboard-based melody, Entangled, a thrilling story and charming melody and Ripples, a cry about our limited lifespan. Anyone familiar with Smashing Pumpkins, Coldplay and Radiohead, just to mention a few more recent rock groups, should like this album, as would enjoy Genesis' Wind and Wuthering and Seconds Out."
2,Whirlpool of scratches,"It came in but it was not ""like new."" A whirlpool of scratches came from the center. The first track did not play at all."
5,Cash is King -- This book really helped my family.,"I have always been a saver, and thought I had money well under control. BOY WAS I WRONG! (I only had retirement savings well in hand.) After this book, my wife and I realized we were spending 75% of our income on must haves. The 50/30/20 rule has really changed our approach to money planning. We have finally given up the vain attempt to do monthly budgeting and track all expenses in Money/Quicken and now we just take out cash weekly .. when it's gone, we don't spend anymore until next Monday.Get this book, and a good book on IRAs, 401(k)s, and 529s and you will be well on your way to have all your spending and savings research complete. (THINK INDEX FUNDS!!!).I paid $60,000 and several long years for a top school MBA and in the end I had 3 investments professors tell me they invest in index funds. So now I do as well."
4,A very helpful book,"I have adopted the principles of this book to assist me in getting some financial balance in my life. For me, this book provides me with what I need - a plan to get out of debt and stay out of debt, a plan to accrue some money for emergencies and a way of saving money for large item purchases.There is a calm about me now that I didn't experience before. Other books I have read have either been about investment planning or too detailed and this one is much simpler. The formulas in the book worked for me and I understand my financial situation a whole lot better. This book goes well with David Chilton's book, The Wealthy Barber, and Joe Dominguez's book, Your Money or Your Life."
1,Interesting Story,"I read this book to my children every night before we go to bed. It is a magnificent fairytale on how the characters have 30% of their income devoted entirely to spending on wants and desires. I like a good story as much as the next guy, but would someone recommend a book that is a bit more based on reality? For example, in the equation for the yearly budget, how about including continually compounded interest for credit cards and other debts? All in all, a decent read if you are amused by some thrills, chills, and plot elements involving loosing one's sure footing on a banana peel.Forget this ignorant woman, I'll keep my savings in a coffee can."
5,Wow! This should be required reading!,"I have begun working through the exercises and it has been a eye-opener for me. I wish this had been taught when I was in high school so many years ago. It should be required reading and studied by all young people about to venture out on their own. With this guide and youth the sky is the limit. For those somewhat older it's an attention grabbing help. I highly recommend this book for anyone who works for a living. No get rich schemes here, just good sense and understanding."
4,More about art than Rilke,"I love Rilke, and I bought this expecting something similar to his ""Letters to a young poet."" However, this book seems less personal- it contains much more of Rilke's reflections on Italian art, in Florence, and on the art of the people around him in Germany. It is perhaps more engaging to someone who knows a great deal about the art he is discussing! There are still wonderful, wonderful Rilke moments, but this may not be the best book for non-artists or for people discovering Rilke for the first time."
5,"A true story of life, love and beer","I found this book to one of the most entertaining pieces I have ever read! Once I started, I could not put it down. The true-to-life stories being told as they unfold are warm and witty. ""E-Male..."" will make you laugh out loud with Jeff and Anthony as they traverse through life. A must read for women everywhere!"
5,Long Horns / Samurai Jack,"This calendar is the greatest! I just love those Samurai Jack / Long Horn's calendars... Samurai Jack and Long Horn's side by side, fighting the evil AKU to return to the past and the pasteur. The great Long Horn slaying hordes of beetle bots with its really long horns. Then the next month you get the great Samurai Jack herding hordes of Long Horn's."
2,HORRIBLE translation!!! BEWARE!,"This series is very good and I loved it very much. I wanted to buy the season so I bought it from here. And when I watched it, I got SO MAD! The translation is HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! I got so frustrated and found out it was a PIRACY dvd season!!! I want my money back..."
5,So so so so so so so so so so good!,"If you like the anime or if you like the manga, you will LOVE this (both seasons). It's fantastic! And the main actors capture the characters so well! This is a review of the actual show, and not the DVDs, as I have never been able to find a place that sells them with English subtitles. And please, Amazon overlords, PLEASE stock this again. Some of us would really like to buy it..."
5,ComPLEteLY AddICTiVe!!!!,"I wasn't sure about this series when I bought it [I was just excited about Shun Oguri playing the character Rui Hanazawa]-but it turned out to be absolutely AMAZINGGGGGG!!!! So what if the music is alittle a little ""Harry Potter-ish""? Or the acting is alittle on the cheesey side?This is a Japanese drama, People!!! And I give it five stars for being one of the most addictive and highly entertaining series I've watched all year. HECK-even my mom, who is not much of a fan of anime or the Japanese culture, made me promise to not watch a single episode without her!"
1,Buyer beware,"I'm glad I rented this disaster instead of buying it on DVD. And it was a FREE rental at that, so all that was wasted was my time. About the only positive thing I can think of to say about this film is that Melanie Griffith looked phenomenal (especially in those red leather pants). But that alone does not a movie make."
5,Paradise Lost!,"Larry Clark has never been one to beat around the bush. Sugar-coat the truth. And once agin he does this by pushing reality in our faces and make us go WOW! ""THIS IS THE F**KING WORLD I LIVE IN?""And of course the soundtrack is amazing and sets the mood in every aspect.I recommend this movie to anyone. But some will be offended but Hell! life is offensive."
2,Terrible,"I'm a Larry Clark fan (even if he is a bit sex obsessed) but this flick is just bad.It's just a couple of middle aged criminals pairing up with a couple of naive sex-crazed kids and setting off on a rather unexplosive crime spree. There isn't anything special going on here. I found myself anticipating the point of good viewing for the entire hour and 1/2 only to see the credits roll.If you're looking for something shocking, important and semi true-to-life like Clarks other films, don't waste your time or money on this one. You'll be deeply dissapointed.(...). $10 is pocket change but it's way too much money to be spent on this movie."
2,Eh.,"Woods and Griffith (but mostly Woods) give great performances, but in the end, this movie goes nowhere. I left it feeling like I hadn't just watched a feature-length film, but maybe a poorly constructed episode of NYPD blue. With just a little more cursing. I'm not the type who minds excessive language, sex, or violence, but there must be a PURPOSE behind it. I'm sorry, but I just didn't see it."
5,Can't believe I LOVED THIS FILM!!!,"For someone who loves sweet romances like ""Titanic"" and ""One Fine Day,"" this brutal film got under my skin and wouldn't let go. James Woods and Melanie Griffith deserve their high critical praise (I was shocked when Siskel & Ebert and others gave this film such raves). And don't be surprised to see Woods & Griffith nominated for Oscars. She was so ""banged up"" and REAL as a heroin addict, it made me cry and had my flesh crawl at once -- and he scared me as much as Samuel Jackson did in ""Pulp Fiction"" (which I didn't like half as much as this film). Go for it -- but be forewarned!"
4,Another Day In Paradise,"All a round, Another Day In Paradise is a really good film. The performances from all four of the main actors are most excellent. Much is made about James Woods in this film ( and rightfully so ) but Vincent Kartheiser ( from the Angel series ) is the one who I was most impressed with. He's a good actor I know, but he pulled off this role frightfully well. It's a Larry Clark film so you know you're going to see quite a bit ( literally ) of the two younger actors ( Kartheiser & Natasha Gregson Wagner ), but this doesn't take away anything from the film ( as in some of Clark's other works ). Overall, the film is very good and I Do recommend it :)."
2,Another Average Movie,"A disappointing follow-up to the impressive ""Kids"", ""Another Day in Paradise"" has some interesting elements (good acting, ok dialogue, a couple of twists), but ultimately it fails to engage and never rises above so-so, mildly watchable material. It`s not a bad choice to watch on a boring afternoon, still it isn`t more than a forgettable and cliched story about young and old criminals in the suburbs. Director Larry Clark has done better, and this blah effort stands as his weakest movie to date.Run-of-the-mill and uninspired."
2,Worth it for 'Woods'.,"It's Larry Clark's road movie with too much ...[profanity] and drugs and not enough of a story.James Woods IS the film~(anything he's in is worth seeing)~ Melanie Griffith...yeah,yeah whatever.Natasha Gregson Wagner looks 22 & Vincent Kartheiser looks like he's 12.Just wade through the boring,corny parts & watch it for Woods' fine performance."
3,Not bad but inferior to its influences,"This film was well-acted overall (Woods is particularly by good) but there's nothing in it that hasn't been done better in other films. Not a bad rental, if you're interested in films of this genre, though. Just don't expect the kind of lasting impact you get from a film like ""Drugstore Cowboy"", still the finest outlaw/drug film I've ever seen."
2,Come on now,"Did I watch the same movie the other reviews watched? The acting was par, direction stunk. Was Woods supposed to be Schizo? The plot had ""Drugstore Cowboy"" written all over it, in fact, skip this and buy the other! You won't be dissapointed."
3,Thoroughly Depressing,"Don't watch this movie if you are prone to bouts of depression - it may well push you over the edge. Not badly acted for this genre of film, but just too much of a downer. NOT for the kiddies!"
4,another day in paradise,"great flick.saw it at least 3 times...goes down as one of my favorites...the sound track is to die for get the cd ya wont be sorry.....james woods deserved an award for this one...he plays it to the max....fast moving, violent,sex, great music..action.great acting by 4 main characters...good cars, far out retro clothes.....life is good......."
5,a kick a** movie,outstanding performances by james woods (mel)melanie griffith(sid)vincnet kartheiser (bobbie)this movie is truly unbeileivable its acted and written fantastic! i definetly reccomend it. not for children lots of drug use and provound language and strong sexual contenti say ***** stars if i could rate it higher i would!YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS!!!
5,The most marvellous book about this subject,"Now updated, this book is the definitive introduction to the subject. It is against this book that others should be judged. If you are interested in Amateur Telescope Making you should buy it (and probably at least Vol.2 and maybe Vol.3). In my opinion this is one of those books that really deserves 6 stars."
3,I AGREE WITH TODD ANDERSON,"I also started making my own telescope in 1968 and wanted to use the most complete book on the subject (and so I chose ATM because it was promoted by Scientific American). I later realized that it was too technical, difficult to understand, and much of it was OUTDATED ALREADY IN 1968. They just keep printing it because it still sells. And it still sells because people still ignorantly think that if it has Scientific American's endorsement, it must be the best (just like I thought).If you are a beginner, don't waste your money on this...If you are a pro at telescope making, then you may benefit from ATM, but that's about it.--George Stancliffe"
5,The final member of the trilogy,"Amateur Telescope Making Book Three published by Scientific American and edited by Ingalls is the last in a series of three books devoted to the science of telescope making. Published in 1953, It is fascinating, but severely dated.This work is a compilation of articles on such varied topics as High Vacuum equipment and spectroscopy. While dated, It nevertheless contains much worthwhile information and would be a welcome addition to any collection on the topic.My favorite chapter is the Editors Chapter at the end of the book. It contains biographical information on most of the regular contributiors.This book should not be confused with an authoritative treatise on modern methods of optical fabrication, but as a history leading to how we got to where we are today.Francis J. O'Reilly"
5,The final volume in a trilogy that has stood the test of time,"Length:: 3:22 MinsThis is the final volume in the series of Amateur Telescope Making references edited by Albert G. Ingalls and published by Scientific American. While this series is well over fifty years old, the principles enunciated are relevant today. I highly recommend this book to the amateur telescope maker as one of the first works that should be in their library.Please note that while I filmed this review at Stellafane, I am not affiliated with the Springfield Telescope Makers and nothing in my review should be construed as an endorsement by them.Amateur Telescope Making : Books 1, 2, and 3, Complete in 3 VolumesAmateur Telescope Making 4TH Edition 3 Volumes"
4,Chase County Almanac,"Moon has written a lot of words about a deserted county in the center of the country. It is a surprisingly good read, yet something is missing. Perhaps I was expecting the touch of angst that he had in Blue Highways. In any event, he has used an interesting approach to describe an area in depth. Put this one next to Sand County Almanac."
3,Loved Blue Highways...,"...so I figured I'd like PrairyErth, but I gotta agree with the other three-star reviewer. In fact, I confess I quit after a few chapters, so unfortunately I never met the feminist rancher or the last remaining Kaws, and it's a shame. In fact, I didn't meet a single human being, and if I recall correctly, didn't even meet an animal. I listened to L-H M staring at handfuls of soil and blades of grass. While I respect L-H M's writing and get his purpose, it was just plain too much contemplation and too little dialog, not to mention action.By the way, I'm also a native Kansan, and recall an enjoyable novel set in the Flint Hills called Firebird. Not a great work of literature, but well researched and I learned much more about the Flint Hills therefrom than I did from PrairyErth."
5,"If God is in the details, he/she is in this book.","A book in my top-ten all-time list. It proves that no place is devoid of deep historic, geologic, and geographic meaning--if you are poetic enough, as Least-Heat Moon is, to observe and record it. The enormous amount of detail is presented in such a way that it makes you happy; as it prolongs the experience. The book has unique features--quotes that lead off every chapter, it's ""geographic"" the organization--that further the pleasure. Every place on earth needs a deep map. I am jealous of anyone from Chase County. I wish my home county had such a comprehensive compendium. To be sure, all of this information is there for the asking, but who esle but WLHM can pull it together in one place and present it in a such a gripping fashion? If you like history, America, people, geology, geography, maps, exploration, or adventure, are experiencing a turning point in your life, or are just someone who appreciates a job well done, this book is for you."
5,I DON'T BELIEVE I COULD BE SO FASCINATED WITH ONE COUNTY,"Having read BLUE HIGHWAYS several years ago I was excited when PRAIRYERTH came out and couldn't wait to read it. Even though itwas a huge book of about a thousand pages, my admiration for William Least Heat Moon was such that I knew I wanted to read this book.When I began to realize we were never going to leave one county in Kansas I was already near the end of the book and wished that it wouldn't end.I don't recommend this book to casual readers, for I think they will miss the beauty and fascination contained in these pages. But for those who love poetry and the sheer beauty of words mixed in with simplicity of spirit in story telling, there are few books that can come close to this one. I also have read RIVER HORSE and am hoping that William Least Heat Moon is writing his fourth book as I write these words!"
2,Who wants to meet these people or people like them?,"You will meet a variety of people, many you wont want to associate with. I sure didn't enjoy reading about them in this book. And I didn't care for the story either.For some good humorous fiction books with a Bridge theme try the Victor Mollo Menagerie or David Birds /terence Reese Monks series."
3,Not Enough Book,"This book is more than mildly amusing. However, there isn't enough _too_ it. The characters are perhaps not fully fleshed out and the bridge details need a lot more work. Still, it isn't a bad book at all."
5,Sleeping With The Enemy!!!!!!!!!,"O my gosh this is the best movie that i have seen in a while!!!!!!! My best friend and I watched this movie together and we loved it!!! The last scene was so ""on the edge of your seat"" that we could barely watch. Julia roberts is great in it but the person who plays the husband was really really really good at bein a bad guy---You really wanted to hate him!!!! i would say that if you are trying to find a good movie to watch no matter what mood you are in, I would get this one!!!!"
1,Doesn't compare to book,Whoever enjoyed this movie must not have read the book! I think Julia Roberts was a BAD CHOICE to play Sara! The film had none of the depth intensity the book had. If you haven't had a chance to read it please do. You will not be let down.
3,One major blooper...,"Unless she knew that her husband was going to force her to go on a boat or that she set up something with the guy who owned the boat why would she be taking swimming lessons?I liked the movie, glad I rented it - but wouldn't own it."
4,Suspenseful,"I think this movie came out before Pretty Woman made Julia Roberts a star, and it's a pretty entertaining flick. Julia is a battered woman who escapes her husband and starts anew. But instead of being a harrowing drama flick about the aftermath of an abusive relationship, it's instead a suspense movie.While her husband is tracking her down, Julia gets a house and a cute new neighbor who steadily tries to win her over. No surprise really about this movie, it's fairly predictable. But if you like a modicum of suspense, but scare really easily (like I do) then you'll like this middle-of-the-road suspense drama."
4,"If you haven't, watch it!","I remembered this film from 1991 and rented it again. I love Julia, and it's really worth seeing many times! It's exciting and scary at the same time. Go For It!"
4,Sleeping with the Enemy keeps you on the edge of your seat.,This movie is well acted and will draw dread and charm from you. Worth seeing. Not for the sensitive.
3,Good if you don't mind a dose of sentimentalism,"Brutal husband abuses pretty wife, she flees in disguise to the Midwest, is tracked down and does what a woman has to do. It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't quite make up its mind how sinister it wants to be or how sentimental. Virtually all the tension is lost once Julia Roberts meets a ""new guy"" - one of those bearded, sincere types who should be excluded from all movie scripts. From too early on, you know she's going to be all right, once she's had a good weep and tried on a few different hats."
1,Sleeping With The Enemy,"Hated this movie. It was corny, predictable and boring (falsely, lamely exciting). Characters were stereotypical and almost caricatures of what they were supposed to be. Recommended by a friend - didn't have the heart to tell her what I thought. Hope she doesn't read this review. Wife and I kept looking at each other during the movie, thinking, who would make such a crappy movie? Couldn't wait for the end. Stuck it out so I'd know what I was talking about, although, it's doubtful I'll ever talk about this movie again."
1,predictable melodrama,"I RECENTLY BOUGHT THE DVD AT A DRUGSTORE DISCOUNT BIN HOPING TO SEE A TAUTLY STRUCTURED DRAMATIC FILM; INSTEAD THE PLOT WAS PREDICTABLE, THE ACTING CONTRIVED, AND THE VILLAIN SO OVERDONE AND OVERACTED THAT THERE WAS NO CREDIBILITY AT THE FILM""S OUTSET. THE OVERSWEET JULIA ROBERTS AND THE FAUX MENACING OF HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND LEFT ME LOOKING AT THE CLOCK TO SEE THE TIME RUN OUT. ONLY REDEEMING FEATURE WAS JERRY GOLDSMITH""S MUSICAL SCORE; OTHERWISE A FORGETTABLE FILM."
5,How Come Julia Didn't Just Divorce This Geek Like In Real Life?,"This is a very tiring Suspense/Thriller starring Julia Roberts who plays ""A Professional Victim"" to this Anally Retentive Geek that she is married to. Then to escape from the geek she fakes her own death and relocates to another town but the geek is soon hot on her trail. For the life of me I can't understand why Julia didn't just file for divorce, get a Restraining Order and take her husband to the cleaners? That would have been more believeable and it happens every day in your friendly local neighbourhood. I give this movie 5 stars because I do like the look of the town that Julia moves to."
4,Husband From Hell!,"Julia Roberts plays a battered wife who is reaching her breaking point with her obsessive, controlling , and abusive husband. So she fakes her death during a storm on a sail boat and runs away. She changes her identity and settles down in a small, peaceful town. Trying to forget about her husband and her past, she starts dating her neighbor and begins enjoying her new life of freedom! But little does she know that her psychotic husband is hot on her trail. And is ready to get serious revenge on her. But little does he know that things can always backfire. And a person can only be pushed so far before they give you a taste of your own medacine. Full of action- packed thrills and super suspense! A classic along the lines of ""Enough"", ""Dolores Claiborne"" and ""Fatal Attraction""!"
4,Sleeping With The Enemy,This is an excellent movie...that I enjoyed a lot. The plot is great..the acting wonderful. The story is a good one...enough to hold your interest throughout the entire movie.
4,Man In The Long Black Coat...,"As a thriller, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY is an oddity. In a genre filled w/ psychotics and mega-murder, SWTE has the former without the latter, yet manages to work quite well anyway. This is due to the role of Julia Roberts as Laura, a brutally abused spouse, driven to do whatever it may take in order to escape. Her ""perfect"" marriage is quickly shown to be a sick, violent charade, dominated by an utterly insane, control freak husband (Patrick Bergin). Laura uses great ingenuity and stealth in her plan for freedom. Unfortunately, hubby is obsessed w/ finding Laura, so he can regain his possession and control of her life. While the middle part tends to drag a bit, setting up a cozy, small town existence for Laura (yep, there's the hat thing), the finalé is certainly worth the wait! Laura must face the fact that there's only one way out of this, and it's NOT by getting a restraining order..."
5,unbeliveable,best movie on earth i can't believe they made this movie so good i will watch it for the rest of my life.
4,Sleeping With the Enemy,"This was an excellent movie. I feel like it depicted domestic violence very well, although not all cases are as severe as this one."
4,good but gets a little slow,"This movie is a good suspence movie but needs a little more action in the middle. ok. Julia Roberts plays Laura Burney, a battered housewife who's had enough of her organised and beating husband(Patrick Bergin in a great and nail biting performance)She fakes her drowning because her husband is so caught up in himself that he doesn't know she learned to swim. He learns and follows her to Idaho where she has a new house, a new identity, and a new love in her life. He slowly shows his existance by making her kitchen cabinets organised and neatly folding her towels. He shows himself and you must watch this movie to find out what happens."
5,All Time Favorite Movies!,"I love this movie. I have watched it again and again on VHS and hope that it will be released on DVD. I love the way this movie was filmed. Some of my favorite scenes are, the drops of blood from his hand dripping into the commode where he finds her wedding ring. Julia Roberts character on the front porch after cleaning the house she rents, very relaxed. The street where the house resides is just beautiful. The call to her mother when all she can do is listen. Great Film and Great Ending."
5,Captivating,"I have always liked this movie. It's older, yes, but as many times as I've seen it, it never seems to get old."
4,Updating movies,I've been updating my old VHS tapes to DVD's. Was glad I wasw able to find so many of the older movies I was looking for. Arrived within alloted time and was well packaged. Thanks Amazon!
3,Rainy Day Movie,This is a great movie to watch on a cold rainy day. It is full of suspense even though you can usually guess what's going to happen next. I can watch this movie over and over again. It's not a classic but worth the time invested.
5,J.W.,OMG THE VERY FIRST TIME I SAW THIS MOVIE I WAS BLOWN AWAY. IT IS WRITTEN SO WELL WITH A PLOT THAT WILL GRAB YOU FROM THE FIRST MINUTE. I LOVE THE UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND TURNS. TOTALLY RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE.
3,Enjoyable fun 90's thriller,I enjoyed this film from the great acting from a young Julia Roberts. The film is early 90's so it's not the greatest but it's very entertaing. the film is very suspensfull and the acting is good. The plot is original and has you on the edge of your seat.
2,The only thing helpful is the practice tests on the CD...,"The purpose of the book is to prepare you for the certification exam. For me it didn't meet that requirement.The book does have a section for each of the objectives Microsoft has defined for the exam. But is FULL of errors (typos and concepts too!!), lacking good examples, concepts are defined vaguely and there is A LOT left out.I took the exam and passed but I don't feel it was because of the book. I had to do additional research on each topic because the book wasn't enough. And in the exam there is definitely much more than the book covers.The 2 stars are because:1. The CD that comes with the book. The practice tests are very helpful to prepare for the exam, not only because they are exam-like questions but because you see some topics that weren't even mentioned on the book.2. Considering is the only preparation guide for this exam, it at least guides you very briefly on the topics of the exam."
3,Adequate,"I'm puzzled why this book has a 4.5 star rating and the 70-536 book has only three stars. The biggest criticism of the 70-536 was the amount of errors, however this 70-526 book also has many errors, including many that are not on the errata sheet.Anyway, this book will get you pointed in the right direction. If you are a C# developer, you will may notice the sample C# code has some interesting characters - this is because they have intermingled VB.NET syntax in the C# code. Not a big deal to me, but some people may find this distracting.You may want to be aware that another book exists that provides comprehensive coverage and is a better read, although there are no labs or sample questions:Windows Forms 2.0 Programming, by Chris Sells and Michael Weinhardthttp://www.amazon.com/Windows-Forms-Programming-Microsoft-Development/dp/0321267966"
2,The same old same old,"Once again the microsoft manuals do not cover the work required.It's ridiculous.Hours have to be wasted on the research of missing classes,and trawling the MSDN website.What is the point of selling a manual if it does not even cover your own test excercises?The exercises in the cd are full of errors.It's unbelievable that are not reviewed and checked.There is no expiry date given for the course either in the manual, by shear coincidence I have discovered that NET 2.0 courses are expiring in June of this year(2011),a trap for the unwary.The sample code, only shows the most basic examples.The deployment chapter samples are really very poor.The only good feature of this manual is that is has good clarity and can be used for quick references."
2,Can't Pass the Exam with a High Score,"After reading this book and passing 70-526 exam, I found the book has 3 problems at least.1. The book might cover all topics against the exam but doesn't include all necessary information for you to pass it. For example, a question in my real exam asked a question about Thread Monitor. However, the book doesn't mention anything about Monitor.2. The book has at least 2 different writing styles.3. The book can't include enough pictures to illustrate what controls it is talking about, how controls are related to one another or how they interact. This leads that sometimes I lost what the book tried to tell me.It is impossible for you to pass the exam with a high score only by this book.You might pass the exam with fears by the book."
5,Blindsided,"I found this book fasinating and enjoyed it even more than the first of the series. The relationship between the two main characters has depth and their interplay adds a nice counter foil to the gritty reality of their search for the killer.It is a tour of San Francisco, murder and life, with a touch of humor. This book is a good read. Put it in your beach or travel bag."
4,"Graphic, But Great-Best I've Read In A While!","Sure it's graphic as many other reviewers have pointed out. But it's about cops chasing a serial killer. You don't want graphic, don't read about serial killers, they aren't nice guys.Anyway, this book has a million twists and turns. Never dull. Inspector Jane Candiotti and her partner (both on and off the force) Kenny Marks are likeable and interesting from Page 4, when you first meet them. Same for the other cops in their squad, you quickly get attached to this group.If you like thrillers and can take a little gore, read on, you won't be disappointed. I read alot of thrillers and this is the best one I've read in ages."
5,A Must Read,"The most suspenseful book I've read in years. Captivating characters you intensely care about. An engrossing, elegant and fully satisfying read. Can't wait for the next installment. I highly recommend it."
1,Gore,Apparently Clyde Phillips thinks gore is more important than good writing. I don't see how anyone would want to waste their time reading a book that starts out with someone getting their eyes gouged out with a spoon.
5,THE EYES HAVE IT,"This follow up to ""Fall from Grace"" brings back our heroes, Jane Candiotti and Kenny Marks, and lets them get more personally involved, in light of Jane's near-fatal mistake in the first book.The murderer in this one is identified early on, but does not take away any of the suspense Phillips so craftily builds. The inclusion of Kenny's nephew in the story adds a different twist, and actually, ends up saving the heroes' lives at one point.The killer is a nasty one, shooting out the eyes of former or current police officers. Phillips pulls some surprises in that he allows some of the officers we've become familiar with in both novels to come to rather unexpected ends.The final twist is a real big one, and Phillips handles it expertly and believably.Looking forward to more Candiotti and Marks escapades in the future. A great read."
5,uk subs,"Some people think the uk subs are ""second generation punk"" what ever that means, this is a classic punk album from an original punk band who were one of the last bands to play the now legendary Roxy Club in London (closed december 1977). The uk subs represent British punk at its finest and this album is a must, if you dont aleady have it."
5,another kind of blues,"one of the greatest punk albums of all time,i find it unbeliveable that anyone has yet to review this classic, from c.i.d. to stranglehold to tommorows girls this album is one of the best examples of second generation punk to be found anywhere. charley harper and nicky garrett at their best"
1,about the same as The Subhumans ( that means garbage),"This is supposed to be some kind of punk classic and, according to an earlier Amazon reviewer, an ""artistic peak"" for UK Subs (God help us)What worries me is that people will buy ""Another kind of Blues"" and think that because this so-called punk-classic is garbage that all so-called punk classics are garbage. They aren't. Buy ""Mush"" or ""Horsebox"" by Leatherface and you'll see what I mean."
2,not bad for a product made in China but may not hold up,This is an inexpensive shifter made in China. I am going to refurbish my old Spark-o-matic from the 60s rather than use it. It is not as rugged as I had hoped.
3,ok,"this bracelet is beautiful, however, i thought it would be a little more sturdy since it is sterling silver, it seems a little flimsy."
4,I love this CD.,Picked up this disc from the artist at his 1999 performance at the International Pop Overthrow festival in Los Angeles. It has been in my car stereo ever since.
2,For completists only,"I love the Perry Mason series, with its fast-paced movement, bizarre twists, and (now) dated atmosphere. But this entry is weak. There are far too many characters, and the plot is extremely convoluted. Perry breaks the law 8 or 9 times without any justification, tarnishing his image of someone who is protecting justice and not just his clients. The result is that it is simply not as enjoyable as the best in the series. To call any of the novels ""believable"" would be a stretch, but this one is so far out of bounds that you simply stop taking it seriously. It is the only book in the series that I can remember having to push myself to finish. That is not a good sign for what should be escapist entertainment."
1,Poor sound quality,This is a recording of a live performance in London that sounds like it was made in France from what sound managed to get through the chunnel. A total waste of money!
5,Champeen,"This book is a riveting story of life in a small rural town and the joys and heartbreaks of growing up. I loved the storytelling of Heather Ross Miller, and felt like I was in Badin NC, sweltering in the summer heat! Can't wait till her next book is published this fall to hear her wonderful storytelling voice once again! I give this book 5 stars!!!"
3,EXACTLY as expected,I ordered the book solely on title alone... My grandfather used that word relating to a 'pin' we used to pass back and forth for the champeen at checkers!!! I couldn't have been more then 8 or so... Champeen was his way of saying Champion...
5,Great. Essential. Outstanding. Uncanny.,Great! Essential! Outstanding! Uncanny! That's all I can say...
1,"Wack song,decent Video",another Corny Prince song that is a Clutter of past riffs are tied as a song.in other words the same problem that has plagued Prince for the past almost 20 years.needed another Producer long ago&some new ideas with the Music making.the video is cool though.this Cut sounds like a Poor Man's Bon Jovi Leftover that should have stayed on the Cutting room floor.
2,Better talk fast!,"As long as you've got a full charge on the battery and you're only planning on using it to order a pizza, this isn't a bad phone. I'm actually here shopping for a new phone, after having to scramble for my standby corded phone for the umpteenth time. I've tried replacing the battery - no luck.Do yourself a favor and keep looking."
5,Absolut SkaRaiRapFunkRockSoul!,"Had the great fortune to see them live in Montreal this summer uring the jazz fest. Live, they are a storm of rhythm and dance. Undoubtedly the best live act I've ever seen. If only more of us insular Americans could understand French! Zebda is ""butter"" in Algerian Arabic, a pun on the French slang for ""Algerian immigre"" (""beur""). Music with such soul and energy is indeed rare to find. Unlike other political bands, the music is in the driver's seat, the message comes after they take you on a good long ride. Lyrics about discrimination, street life, illegal immigrant existence. With the possible exception of Assassin, I can't think of another French act that has been able to achieve what Public Enemy did."
5,Tomber la chemise,"For all of you trying to decide whether or not to purchase this CD, the answer is DO IT! I went to France this past summer with some friends, and as bad as this sounds, it's like our theme song. All of these songs have such a good beat, and they're completely different than most of the music you find here. I would recoment it to anyone, it always puts me in the best of moods. I hope you grow to love it as much as I do!"
5,Intense experience,"Zebda (butter in Arabic) is far from greasy, the music is rich and playful. These guys are not afraid to experiment with anything, and it sounds great. I saw them in concert in 1998 and I was hooked, although my french is very lacking, they come loud and clear, while you might describe other music as a spiritual experience, this music is a sensual one !"
2,Mish Mash Breaks and DNB,"Raw, Uncut and pretty rough. After listening to DJ Hype's Fabriclive.03, Grooverider brings me back to my musical reality. This genre is not for me.2/5 stars."
4,Adequate neti pot.,"I've been using this neti pot for three years, and I have absolutely no problem with it's function. However, I am in the market for a new one because I am tired of cleaning it. Mold starts accumulating in the nozzle, and it's difficult to clean out. It's a good pot in terms of how well it cleans my sinuses, and I will keep it for travel."
4,Basic Action Film,This is a pretty basic action movie not really anything special but yet sometimes I find myself wanting to watch it again!I've no idea as to why!Anyway if you are looking for a pretty basic action movie (and if you find this web page) Buy this!
2,Same problem with DVD(freeze defect),"Got my copy yesterday and was watching it last night. Was I dissapointed with the defect I experienced with the disc. At 57:58 (fight in the bar scene with the big guy), the disc freezes. You have to press the FF key and it will move to the scene 2-3 seconds later. Kind of annoying cause while enjoying and anticipating a big fight ...it stops....duh!....To Tadashi and Mr. Tindall... we're now victims of this frustrating defect..Seems we are owners of defective dvds. I bought the dvd cause I loved the movie...still remember my reaction to the fresh new fight scenes.... now we have the DVD but...... 4 .5 stars for the movie(for the action) but 2 for the DVD(video defect and lousy 4.0 audio)..."
4,Nice Cap,This was purchased as a gift for one of our grandson's - he was very happy with it. Priced right.
2,Not one size fit all,The product is way to big for the average adult head. I have a 7 1/4 - 7 1/2 size head. The Knit cap was way too big. It really looks funny. I never wear it because it looks silly. This is for the adult size. It seems others are happy with the youth. Unless you have a HUGE Mellon I would not suggest this purchase
4,Loussier & Friends,"Yet another great Loussier Bach recording. These are jazz arrangements of Bach's concertos for 2 & 3 keyboards. Loussier only plays in the concerto for 3 keyboards.Loussier's ""Cool Jazz"" style wears thin after a while, after listening to his Bach, Satie, etc., so I preferred the concertos for 2 pianos because the Pekinel sisters have a less chromatic style.The last track ""Jesu, bleibet mein freude"" is nice, but not really jazz, but rather a simple piano arrangement of the cantata."
2,Old and slow,I bought 6 and they showed up in good shape and quickly. One died after 2 hours of use! They are an old design and take a long time to get going. Not what I expected. The new bulbs are much quicker that I buy at Home Depot etc.
5,fine for corner over the sink,"i read other reviews after buying it and was therefore prepared to dislike this bulb. but instead, one of the things other viewers found annoying -- the warmup to full strength -- was delightful to me, especially turning on the light upon waking. nice to have it build gradually to full strenght. note that this is not the main light in the kitchen, just the one over the sink, in a corner."
3,Not as attractive as halogens,The bulbs take some time to brighten. I wanted to switch from halogens as they get very hot. These. Ulbs stay cooler and save wattage. If you can give up some styling and dont mind waiting for full brightness they are fine.
4,Beautiful!!!,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was 10 years old, but then I saw about five years later when it was on TV and I laughed, cried and fell in love with it. Though I hate to tell ppl that this my favorite movie, it really is. It just feeds the hopeless romantic in me. Baz Luhrmann is a great director, even if you don't like his movies you gotta admire his brilliant creativity. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are great as the young star-crossed lovers, but I could imagine different actors doing a finer job... (sorry guys!) My absolute favorite part of the movie is the party scene where R+J first meet. The Fishtank scene...*melt*....ahh gets me every time. But seriously, this movie is brilliant, a refreshing twist on the age old tale and I highly recommend renting it."
3,Feels dated,"I appreciate that real text is used. The style feels abrasive, and it doesn't add to the story. It just hurts the flow. I do remember being pretty happy about it in 1996, but it does not stand the test of time. Nevertheless, if you are studying Shakespeare's story, this is a must watch. What makes the story move forward? How are the relationships and each character portrayed? Mostly engaging cinematography."
4,Awesome movie,"This is an incredible movie. I saw Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge before this movie, and once agin Baz Luhrmann blew me away. He weaves modern-day setting and attitude in to this brilliant old-age play. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes give spectacular performances. I also found it interesting how they also added some modern words with the old English. He also stayed true to the story, and added upon it. It is the basic story of two star-crossed lovers born from two rival families, the Montagues and the Capulets who take their lives on one fateful day. The only flaw is in some parts, they talk way too fast, but other than that this movie is one of the best."
5,puts a new twist on a great love story,"the first time i saw this movie i hated it, i didnt understand what they were saying or what the heck was going on. But then we read the play in english, and i saw the movie again and i loved it! i think the thing about this movie is if you understand what they are saying. Its an awesome movie and i really like that they kept most of the orignal lines, and how they speek in old english. Before you buy or even watch this movie, i think you should read the play, just so you get alittle back ground on it and you know what they are talking about."
5,awesome,definately one of the better romeo & juliet movies...the cast is absolutely perfect...they're awesome at the roles they got. definately one of my favorite movies.
1,William Shakespeare would be ashamed,"This was the worst adaptation of a Shakespeare work I have ever been unfortunate enough to watch. There was no originality in updating the family feud to a fight between gangs. Have we seen West Side Story? And the fact that the final scene in the movie was changed was revolting. The reason they committed suicide was to defy fate. It's hard to do that when I expect to hear Homer Simpson say ""Doh!"" as Juliet wakes up to a dying Romeo. The most insulting part of the film had to be the balcony scene that took place in a pool. Where did that come from? Ugh. Not to mention the fact that for the entire movie Claire Danes displays fewer emotions than inanimate objects. Read the play or see the 1968 Zefferelli adaptation, spare yourself this teenybopper melodrama."
1,forgive us will,"I can't give much of a review for this movie. I stopped paying attention after the first five minutes and turned it off after 20 min. It was chaotic and trying to hard to be hip and up to date. I can appreciate chaotic movies, Nowhere was one of my personal favs. but when applied to something with a solid storyline, it just makes the story tertiary to what is going on visually. admittedly I had a bias to begin with, not necessarily with leo, but with the story, romeo and juliet was never my fav shakesperean story. but I think it could have been so much better. That and drop the LA gangbanger thing, that was just too MTV."
1,One Awful Movie,"This needs 0 stars. This movie was so poorly made. they try to put shakespearian dialog in with a movie that takes place in the 90's with a bunch of seemingly stoned spazes and popcorn farts that don't know what they're doing. I won't read the play again because of this movie. Nothing in the movie was right. And if you know who did the music, give them a kick in the b*l*s for me."
1,A disgrace,This movie is more like a mockumentary to classic literature. I was turned off by all the present modern effects. The actors were brave to even try this film.
1,So Very 1990's,"Ooooh-soup-bowl haircuts,a cast consisting mostly of under 20 year olds and that largely moribund soundtrack to boot.Baz Lurhmann's take on The Bard's ""Romeo + Juliet"" is THE singlemost dated and nausiating film I've seen!Not only is the dialogall set in ye olde' english but the SETTING remains throughallycontemporary-guns instead of swoards,gangs instead of knights!It coulda' been a great avante-garde idea but it's so obviouslydesigned to pander to the culturless,cynical MTV-generationpsuedo-grunge teens of the mid 90's that the overal results andexcellent cinamatography is smothered in a context that looksand feels truely pathetic.Unless your ARE one of the type's listed above-then this might be the way for you to embraceShakespere.But if your not-steer clear of this wretch-inducingmistake!How Leonardo DiCaprio survived to get to ""Titanic"" isbeyond me,but he did.And Baz Lurhmann MORE then made up for thisblunder with his recent triumph ""Moulin Rouge"".Phweee!!!!"
1,Frentic and Overrated,"I went with some friends to see this at the theater on a rainy afternoon, and was expecting a pleasant surprise. What I got was an unexpected disappointment.While the movie starts out very well, opening on the aftermaths of Romeo and Juliet's deaths, the film starts quickly losing it by the minute. While it sounded like a good idea to modernize Shakespeare's most famous play, by still retaining the original dialogue and speech, it doesn't come together very well. Director Baz Luhrmann is trying too hard to cater to the MTV generation and the teen girls who love Leo."
5,Awesome modern adaptation,Many purists will not like this modern adaptation but I love the use of Shakespeare's actual dialogue but in a modern setting with guns instead of swords. My only criticism is that the voices of both Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio are not developed to properly deliver Shakespeare's lines.
3,Does not hold on together all that well,"It's a movie that has its crowd. I see how it may appear totally ""rad"", but the dialogue sounds absolutely ridiculous. The update of the context was well done, though, and would've worked very well. But the dialogue spoils it- it sounds like a very old-fashioned thing to say, even though I normally go for non-conventional movies- but it doesn't work. The BEST adaptation is without a doubt Franco Zeffirelli's, with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussy- utterly sublime, and intense enough even for its original context."
3,"""CLAIRE DANES ACTS BEATIFULY!""","From the reviewer of Pirates of the Caribbean and Roswell. I love Claire Danes` acting skills! Not oppopriate for kids! But it is romantic, erotic, and poetic! watch the most amazing dazziling 2 Hours of your life!"
2,Takes me back...,"..to ninth grade English! Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes sound like they merely read the lines (even haltingly at times), not understand and feel them. The only redeeming things about this are the sets, so wonderfully overabundant at times it's dreamlike, and the characters of Tybalt and Mercutio. One other thing is the mostly successful attempt to update the play. This version is nothing compared to the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli one, with the hauntingly beautiful Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, who combine the innocence and shyness of adolesence with its overwhelming emotion, every line and look bleeding with it. The DiCaprio/Danes movie is a poor version of a great play. I rented it again recently, to see if it got better, but I cringed whenever Romeo and Juliet talked. It's really too bad."
5,Timeless classic with a modern spin,"I remember watching this movie in the theather when it first came out. I was in high school at the time, and we had been studying Shakespeare. This movie founded my love for this amazing playwrite. The modern spin on the movie really makes the characters more relateable, and makes the Shakesperean language easier to understand. It is fast-paced and dramatic, and watching it 11 years later, I still teared up. DiCaprio and Danes were both remarkable, and I applaude the directing."
3,This movie moves too fast,"This movie is excellent, except it moves too fast. It's hard for me to keep on track where I'm am. The language they spoke is same to the book but it just move to fast."
3,Don't watch this movie if you don't catch on fast!,"I didn't truly love this movie. It was kind of hard understanding, but it was okay. Once again I cried and cried!"
3,Worthy Effort,"Claire and Leo did a good job reciting the lines from the play, but their love was just not believable. The modern day setting of the play, to me, was kind of tacky. The play loses its authenticity and you don't get the ""total experience"" you should from a Shakesperean play. Or in this case, a movie based on a Shakesperean play."
2,THANKYOU LEO!!!,"I think the film was a little bit bored. I didn't like the way they talk so it was bored. But Leo did it well, he was there to save me. Thankyou Leo!!! END"
5,A unique version of the classic tragedy,"Modernizing an old story can sometimes work but not always (Great Expectations was questionable) but in my opinion Lurhman's worked modern retelling of Romeo and Juliet quite well. The cinematography is magnificent, the actors did quite well (esepcially with such tedious lines), and overall it was a really cool experience. Recommended."
3,"It Almost Worked for me, but...","Read kerki and Eric's review. I won't be redundant and say the same things, because I agree wholeheartedly. Visually, this was quite stunning..beautiful. The outlandish, as they say ""MTV"" look was good, kinky, modern. If they would have dropped the accents and brought Shakespeare's words into today's vernacular, I probably would have given it 5 stars. The new story idea was that good. The cast was delicious, as were the sets. It's really too bad. With just the one change to modern English, this could have become a cult classic. As stands now, I'll just keep watching Zeferrelli's version forever. Now, that's Shakespeare."
4,Greatest Love Story Of All Time!!,"This brillant and contemporary retelling of the world's most tragic love affair makes this wildly inventive ""Romeo and Juliet"" unforgettable. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes portray Romeo and Juliet, the youthful star-crossed lovers of the past. But the setting has been moved from its Elizabethan orgins to the futuristic urban backdrop of Verona Beach.This movie is great and it overall a really good buy for anyone!!***Check it out!***"
5,A Great Movie,"This movie is great.The cast did a great job in making the movie modern and they still had the play in the movie.I think that lots of people would like the movie,I do and I know people who do to."
4,Just Awesome!,"I wasn't sure that the poetic language of Shakespeare could so easily be tranplanted in modern times. Luckily, Baz proved me wrong. This movie had so many stunning images. It was made to hold your attention and it did that job well. Danes and DiCaprio are wonderful together. Baz was true to the story but added just enough to make us believe that it had happened recently and not 300 years ago. If only he would add his touch to all of Shakespeare's work, then maybe more people would enjoy it."
4,Great movie if you're fluent in Shakespeare-ish.,"This is generally a very good movie, but somtimes it sounds a little funny when it's not supposed to, like when they say ""Put down thy sword!"" and the camera is looking into the barrel of a high-powered automatic rifle. Leonardo DiCaprio was better here then in Titanic, but I like both these movies a lot. Claire Danes is beautiful, I wish it was easy to be as pretty a Juliet as her. She is also much easier to understand than the other actors and actresses. My only complaint with this movie is it's very hard to just sit down and watch, you havge to be very focused on it to understand the actors, and also to be able to follow the plotline. The actors are great, and Leo is cute."
4,:]],A really great representation and interpretation of Shakespeare's tragic romance. Good for a regular movie night or to help understand the written play.
4,A visual feast,"After watching this movie again (after a couple years hiatus) I felt it truly deserved a review. This movie is *not* for everyone, and perhaps even some die-hard shakespearean aficionados might not like it, but truly it is a visual feast, as well as an interesting twist on an old tale. Some inspired casting adds to the appeal of the film, with only a minor amount of mis-direction every-so-often marring an otherwise cool perspective. Perhaps this movie can/would be categorized as a borderline cult classic - either way, it is something different worth seeing. Watch the whole film!"
2,Ugh. This did not stand the test of time.,"Oh, to be 12 and not care about quality.I remember going to see this in the theater and thinking it was so great and edgy and artistic. I was actually looking forward to watching it again.BARF.Actors stumble over the dialogue. The hyperkinetic editing makes me dizzy. John Leguizamo is as awful as ever.At least this one doesn't have Ewan McGregor singing like some other Baz Luhrmann blerg-fests."
2,AMAZON PLEASE USE CLOSED CAPTIONING,"This is probably a VERY good movie. To take the classic story in drop it in modern-day Verona, with the Shakespearian dialogue intact is sheer genius. But I had difficulty understanding much of the words. Sorry Amazon, I'm an extremely literal person and if I don't know what they're saying I get confused. To top it off, many of the words have archaic meaning and if I don't see them written I have no idea what they are. The only ""fix"" for me would be to follow along with a script. But I watch movies to be entertained. Don't want to have to study them at the same time.I URGE AMAZON TO USE THE CLOSED CAPTIONING WHICH IS ALREADY PRESENT ON THE MOVIE TRACK."
5,Excellent film,"The modern setting what looks to be modern-day California; great score; awesome actors (Daines, diCaprio, Leguizamo); and original Shakespearean dialog make for a great experience to an old play. This version certainly reinvigorates the rather worn story of two star-crossed lovers."
5,Must own!,"After many years of ""you should really watch this movie, dad"", I finally watched it.... and then bought it... /shame on me, for calling myself a ""Shakespeare fan""- what a terrific adaptation... It now is in a 1st place tie with my other favorite 'modern' adaptation of WS- ""10 Things I Hate About You"" [aka 'The Taming of the Shrew']..."
2,Shunning Shakespeare,"In a beweldering attempt to create a Shakespearean movie set in today's era, the director, Baz Luhrmann, has messed up. He introduced Dicaprio and Danes to Shakespearean language that they are far from reciting in a flowing manner that sounds correct.Luhrmann has gotten rid the beautiful gowns that Shakespeare had his actors in and turned it into a wild fashion show that many may dislike. Despite his mistakes Luhrmann has not been at a total loss, he did manage to translate the characters into modern characters we can recognize well, such as the flamboyant Mercutio into a RuPaul; however some do not stay true to Shakespeare, greatly upseting the film."
4,Stunning and Artistic,"Baz Luhrmann did a great job at fusing a modern-day setting with an outdated script. The original dialogue is used in this flashy telling of William Shakespeare's most memorable work. But you should have no trouble following what the characters are saying because of the excellent ""visual"" aspect to the film. It's one thing to read a Shakespearean play in school, but when you can watch it played out somewhere other than on a stage, it takes on new life. There are many references to other Shakespeare plays in the props and backgrounds so keep your eyes open! The soundtrack keeps this ride moving and fits well with each scene. The most memorable scene for me: ""quiet time"" at the party when Romeo & Juliet discover each other in the bathrooms separated by a fish tank while Desiree sings a down tempo song downstairs."
1,Total waste of time and money!!!!!!,"I tried to watch this movie with an open mind, but after I saw Mercutio, I just wanted to turn it off. I also had a hard time seeing modern times and hearing Shapearean language. To me, it just didn't work. Also, I thouhgt that Claire Daines lacked animation during the pool scene (who thought of this scenery addition?) She almost sounded like she was reading her lines from a script. Leo is a much better actor than what I saw in this movie. He went from speaking in a monotone voice to screaming. (Leo and Claire must have taken acting lessons at the same place) He seems to think that screaming out his emotions is acting. He did a much better job in Titanic. The only reason all of these teenage girls think he can act is because he is sort of cute. (Ah, love is blind) If you like Shakespeare and you want to see it done right, rent the 1968 version. It is a thousand times better than the so-called modern one and as an added bonus, the actors know how to act!"
1,Surprising I didn't sleep by the first 5 minutes,"This is the most boring-est movie I have ever laid my eyes on. There is no plot in this movie and just goes here and there. It has no point and no story to it. If you want a movie to use as a sleeping guide, waste your money on some piece of plastic, this is movie is for you! Other than that, I recommend you to STAY AWAY! I repeat...STAY AWAY!!!!"
1,Shakespeare's rolling in his grave,"For every 16 year old who watched this movie and thought ""How great!"" I only hope that age makes you a little wiser and a little more intelligent with your movie picks. Yeah, I paid the seven bucks to see it, and I was horrified at the liberties they took. I know one of the qualities of great literature is that it can be adapted into modern times and that it's accessible to all ages, but this is a joke. ""Leo"" and Claire Danes are pathetic as the star-crossed lovers. It's uncomfortable to see them try and speak in Shakespeare's language. It also seems that acting in itself had gone by the wayside. There is no legitimate supporting cast--and I couldn't wait until that John Leguzamo guy died. For anyone who likes watching classic movies and not some teenie bop adaptation--I suggest renting the 1967 Zefirrelli's ""Romeo and Juliet."" There's a movie that will bring anyone to tears knowing that this is how it's meant to be done."
1,Mostly MTV trash.,"This modern MTV version of ""Romeo + Juliet"" is another piece of trash taken from classic literature. William Shakespeare's name shouldn't have even been put above the title. The direction by Baz Lurrmann is designed mostly for the MTV teen crowd, with fast cuts and constantly moving cameras. It gets horrible from the get-go. Go rent the 1968 ""Romeo & Juliet"" instead, by Franco Zeffereli."
1,Ridiculous,"This has to be one of the most horrific bastardizations of Shakespeare that I've seen in a while. I felt like I was watching bad Anime (there is some great Anime.. this was Mighty Morphin Power Rangers bad). Juliet's mother was simply embarrassing. The cinematography was good, but I simply couldn't stomach such horrid performances. You really loose something when a duel is gunshots exchanged at a gas station. BORE ME TO TEARS. There's good Shakespeare and bad Shakespeare. The latter is the reading of gracefull poetry. Blech. AND THEN.. there is this... a genre fitting with Evita. A two hour long pile of human excretion. Willy is a-rollin' in his grave."
1,Worst adaptation of Shakespeare's play ever,"Baz Luhrmann, Leonardo Di Caprio, and everyone else involved in this sorry production should be ashamed. They took a wonderful story and destroyed it, made Romeo into a dislikable druggie hood, and twisted the play's words in ways that would have made Shakespeare weep. Avoid this at all costs. Buy the Franco Zeffirelli version if you want Shakespeare, not MTV."
2,Why modernize a timeless classic ... again?,"Take a timeless classic, set somewhere in the 1500s and modernize it to the 20th century. I'm not sure what the purpose of doing this is ... maybe to entice teeny boppers to appreciate brilliant literature with a big box office draw like Leonardo DiCaprio! That's probably why I couldn't get into this movie. Shakespeare would roll over in his grave! No one would believe that anyone talks like that in this day and age. I think that if a retelling of Romeo and Juliet had to be done, put it in modern-age language. This cannot compare to Zefferelli's version (1968) or West Side Story (1961), nor would I try. Even Leo couldn't save this one."
1,LOL,"I saw this in high school after reading the play, and it was so absolutely absurd that one wonders if it's supposed to be a satire. But no, it's just that stupid. The entire class was in stiches. Shakespeare is my all time favourite playwrite, and this is quite possibly the worst adaptation of any Shakespeare play ever written. Full of cliches, discontinuity, cheesy visual ""stretches"" (ie. the gun's the Capulate and Mountague 'thugz' wield are manufactured by ""Sword, co"") to fit the old-century lines. Someone with the mindset of a Jr High school-girl might find this breathtaking, but for the rest, its two hours of laughing at the stupidity."
1,Leonardo does not belong!...,"This version of Romeo and Juliet is a classic case of casting marketable but notably inept actors in the lead roles. The director did a good job of passing the script of the original play through a rusty cheese grater. Unfortunately, people were enchanted with this pulverized excuse for a Shakespeare play. If the bard were still alive, the director would still be in the midst of a nationally televised law suit!Even though I must applaud Luhrmann's attempt at bringing this Shakespeare play into modern times, he failed horribly. Why did there have to be a beach?... The real Verona is landlocked!... Also, calling the guns ""Sabers"" was a pathetic attempt at modernization. If Luhrmann had simply kept the play in its original setting and combined it with real acting and real people it might have had a chance. Actually, I doubt that even Shakespeare himself could have saved this star-crossed production. With Leonardo, it sunk like a man with concrete shoes."
1,Another ruined classic.,The film that surely made Shakespeare turn in his grave. This is another crappy attempt to modernize a classic tale. Don't fix it if it's not broken.
1,Did not get what I ordered,"This was my first time ordering from Amazon. I ordered the DVD Romeo and Juliet, when it arrived, it was a totally different movie from the 1940's! I was not a happy camper as I just spent over $400.00 on only a few items! Not a good way of trying to keep a good business and customers happy."
1,Do not waste your time!,"This film was a disappointment to me. Even though the director has modernised the film, it still seems ""wrong"" somewhere. I dont know if its cos of the dialogue.Learnado Dicaprio is definately not the right person to play Romeo, neither is Claire Danes. Is it just me, but arent Romeo and Juliet supposed to be good looking? Neither of them are even remotely good looking. This film would Definately put people off Shakespeare, So i recommend that you read the book first before attempting to watch this atrocity."
1,HORRIBLE!,This is Romeo + Juliet for the hipster with a short attention span. I found the entire thing revoltingly full of itself and tedious. It is without question the WORST adaptation I have ever seen.
2,Wonderful,"Okay I don't normally like Leonardo Decaprio, but he did an excellent job in this movie. One of the best I have seen. It's up there with Moulin Rouge,Ever After, and A Walk to Remember. SO that says a lot for me. But this is a classic tale with a very modern twist to it. It has it all, love, death, car chases, shootouts..and most of all ROMANCE! Okay I'll stop now. But this is still a favorite of mine and I have seen it 10 times. Maybe I'm obsessive, but so goes life. It's a wonderful film and whoever doesn't like it well...I'm just ashamed...J/k..Okay but seriously go see the film..it's wonderful!"
1,Hamlet? Really?,"The language is ""Olde English"" but the action was a waste of time. Reckless gun brandishing and firing at will but nothing seems to get hit. No consequences. I fell asleep during the movie"
5,I thought this movie was soooo great!!!,This movie was so good. I love Leonardo Dicaprio. I love how it takes place in the furture. I cried at the end. Claire Danes And Leo work very good together. I hope they do another together. END
5,"Captivating, Original, and Wonderful!",This is the absolute best movie ever made. It is definitely NOT a formula movie. It is very original. Never really been done before. I recommend to everybody. But it seems that people over the age of 25 hate it. The death scene was done extremely well. Truly great film-making. A captivating movie.
4,Brilliant,"This movie was.....suspenseful, catching, intelligent, and you had to be able to pay attention to understand what was going on. Though a love story, this is not simply a chick flick...I loved it, I watch it over and over..... It's perfect....."
3,Appealing stars and original at heart,"A very interesting, original movie, which seems to get better and better the more times you watch it. The leading stars are appealing, and an admirable performance is delivered by Postlethwaite as the Friar. The set (art direction, I suppose) is very beautiful. Unfortunately, the first few times you watch it, its dream-like story seems to crawl and lose all its dreaminess. Movies need to have an impact the first time."
4,"Fantastically original!, a visual slendor to experience!","This film is Wonderfully constructed, and an extraordinary concept. Taking William Shakespeare's classic story and tranfering it into today's enviornment is fantastic. The real testament to the films success, is in the fact that it does not matter if you know the the story or not. It's so effective in it's look and design, that it automatically captivates you, comanding you're attention. Combine the fact that you have a classic story behind that look, and it guarentees that the tale will eventually transcend it's time period. With a combination like that; hey! you can't go wrong bro! Excellent"
1,I HATED this movie!,"I hated the fast pace, confusing updates, and wierd coloring. I just hated this whole movie. I am a Shakespere addict, but this adaptation I just can't sit through.Leo and Claire Danes do pretty good jobs, so it's not the acting. I just hate everything else about this movie, it seems to be mocking Shakespere. It was just... ick.Everyone else I know loved this movie, so it might just be me. In any event, if you're looking for some good modern Shakespere, definitely check out Hamlet with Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles. It's great."
2,Romeo & Juliet,"I love the story of Romeo and Juliet, BUT this version is not my cup of tea, it seems to comical, nothing can compare to the Leonard Whiting / Olivia Hussy version, which is a classic."
5,Go Leo!!!!,"Excellent! Great movie, the actors really acted well especially Leo. Taking out Shakespears' Language I really couldn't decide which one is best: Titanic or Romeo & Juliet, because both movies are fantastic. I would recommend this movie to anyone. END"
5,It was great!!,I read the book but I like the movie better and Leo was the best part! I think he's the hottest actor in the world. I'm obsessed with him. END
4,The most romantic movie scene ever...,"A beautiful movie from the director of Moulin Rouge. The key scene is when Romeo (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes) spy each other through the glass fishtank. The look on Romeo's face is that of a man who has seen the stars for the very first time. The background music - ""Kissing You"" by Desiree - is perfect and this scene should go down in movie history."
5,As described!,Good condition. Great price! Would purchase from this seller again. Movie was as described. Purchased to show freshman English class.
3,As Described,As Described. As Described. As Described. As Described. AAs DescribAs Described. ed. s Described.As Described. As Described. As Described. As Described.
2,"Great movie, terrible sound. Audio is totally whackec.",Don't stream this one. The audio ruins a fine production. I don't know where you can get a better version.
3,Middle Ground,"In fairness to the director, I perosnally don't think modern society could handle a straight from the book adaptation of this great story, the language barrier along will turn some off the this awesome story, on top of that movies today rely on action to keep a movies chugging along. Thus I believe the director knew this thus parts of this film are edgey or over the top. So the puriest will rant the modern viewer will rave and the rest of us take the middle ground. By the way for parents looking for a much more differnet take on this story I recommend ""Gnomeo and Juliet"" for them it has a happy ending."
1,William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (Special Edition),"Don't waste your money on this DVD. The cars, the guns, the music, and noise take away from the original story. If they wanted to update the story it would have been better to update the language as well. My students and I much prefer the ""Romeo and Juliet"" DVD with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. I will not make the mistake of showing this particular DVD to my students again."
4,Slow to start,"I hadn't watched since the 90's. Forgot how the movie started off. Once it gets goin, this is an interesting if not completely over the top rendition of the Bard's classic.The music edition's extras were mostly lost on me, but one of these days I'll give them a watch."
1,1 star was always the lowest,"When I first heard of Leonardo Decaprio being Romeo, this sounded good, but everybody talking like they did in the play isn't good. It is just so out-of-date for everybody to be talking like that. Nobody does in L.A. in a 1990s' setting. That's the whole reason that makes it so stupid, that I wonder who actually likes it. The actors, like Leonardo Decaprio and John Leguizamo are good in everything else, except this garbage. Even the fight scenes {with guns} are hard to enjoy even when you try."
1,romeo and juliet,I heard it was a great movie from a friend so i bought it. didn't like the way they spoke in the movie old english
2,No closed captions,"I was happy that the movie did stream well with no interuptions, however it did not have closed captions which was very disappointing. You have wheelchair ramps to your buildings, put closed captions on your movies."
5,how poetic,"baz lurhrmann's view of the world may seem static at first, but soon becomes poetic. It is a bold and brave production of a much loved and performed tale. It is refreshingly colorful, but the seriousness of the story is never lightened. Such an update was long overdue."
3,interesting take on shakespeare,"I like the movie a lot better than I thought I would, though I will admit nothing comes close to the Romeo and Juliet done by Franco Zeffereli. Not too bad of a movie, nonetheless. Leonardo DiCaprio actually did a better job here than in Titanic (not saying much), and Claire Danes was pretty good in her role as Juliet. Overall, a fair job, but I will always prefer the original...sorry, just my opinion"
4,Astoundingly stylish!,"I hadn't planned to watch this movie. But a young friend made me promise to watch it when it came to cable. I assumed it would be some hokey Gen X version that I would have no interest in. Besides, I have no real interest in Shakespere. Anyway, it came to cable, and I watched it. Looks like I'll have to eat crow. I was absolutely stunned by its audacious stylishness. It was a romp from beginning to end. Everyone gave superb performances, except for DiCaprio and Daines, who were merely good enough. They could have found a sexier woman to play Juliet. John Leguizamo and Harold Perrineau Jr. gave especially noteworthy performances. It was a real delight to watch these thoroughly modern characters so effortlessly speak Elizabethan english. Is this a serious and faithful adaptation of the play? Of course not, but who cares? It's just plain fun. This is definitely on my list of cinematic ""guilty pleasures."""
5,excellent movie and service!,The movie is phenomenol modern take on the classic story. It gives it so much more perspective. Its a fast paced thriller.
5,Great!,The DVD arrived much sooner than I anticipated. Movie shows with great film and sound quality. Disc was without scratches or issues and everything seemed brand new.
2,Seriously...,"First off its flea market quality at best...Its a copied dvd (which duh is ILLEGAL) especially for resale.The case is crap, the print on the dvd is amateur ...Its a fair quality dvd, though has some audio lag in some places (no its not my dvd player, ive tested it on multiple with same reaction)I suggest just go out and by the real deal"
1,"claire,leo...just shutup..ok??","this is the most boring film ever made,during the film i got very sleepy,i could'nt understand any word in it,oh god it makes me sick."
1,You cannot be serious!,"This is absoloutely dire. I've tried several times but can't get past the first 3 scenes. I'm glad I read the play before watching this or I would have been put off forever. To say it's a modern adaptation doesn't really describe it - it's more like a pantomime version with Montagues and Capulets not just as rival gangs but as owners of the town, with their respective names in lights on tall buildings. Its only insight is into the producer's self-aggrandisement. Yuk!"
1,the gay romeo and juliet = a waste of time by !idee,"reviewDuring the past week I saw the movie, Romeo and Juliet, directed by Baz Luhrmann and starting Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.The story is based on the play written by Shakespeare but there are many differences.For on there are guns that are called swords in the movie which I find totally ridiculous. Another difference was the fact that it was set in modern times, which made the movie very hard to understandAlso I think that the actors and actresses were very flat. I think this is because of the setting and language doesn't really go together, and therefore it is really hard to get into the characters mind set.Over all I think that the movie wasn't very good at all and it is definitely a waste of money and time."
1,Skip this one...,"I really tried to like this movie. In fact, I have enjoyed several other modern remakes of Shakespeare's plays. This one just doesn't work. The movie setting is today's world while the diaglogue is from Shakespeare's time. The dialogue was hard to understand. This resulted in many of the double entendres being lost in the mush. I hope that the movie producers saved a lot of money. They didn't have to hire a clever scriptwriting staff.The settings for this movie were terrible. The mansions were trying to look like castles and modern houses all at the same time. Again, this didn't work.I also think Dicaprio was miscast. He seemed too inexperienced to play the role of Romeo. His lines sounded forced, and his emotions were often overacted.Skip this one, and see the 1968 version instead. Better yet, attend a live performance."
2,He want to be a star,"This director think he's Kubrick. Or Greenaway perhaps. Or Orson Welles maybe. Or...anyway, you know what I mean. Actually, he is a big thief: took some of many of them. A little pieces from each one. The movie overall is intense, but pretend to be something that is not for sure: a piece of art. It's fully pretentious, but at the end it's a minor movie."
1,Bach music with rap drum beat,"I had to make myself forget that it is Mr. Shakespere's play in order to continue watching the movie. The whole thing is a joke--modern people speak Shakespere's language. A comidy, but a tragedy. It is like playing Bach's music with the drum beat of rap music. I am not saying that it is bad movie. It just spoils the flavor of Shakespere's play."
1,Unbelievably HORRENDOUS,"This movie doesn't make sense- the setting is in more modern form, but the language stayed the same as in old english. It was using machine guns in attempts of suicide and murder instead of daggers. I hated his movie. It was terrible. The only good thing I have to say about it was that claire Danes and Leonardo Dicaprio were good together in this movie."
1,YAWN!,"This movie was shown to us in my English class, along with the classic version. This movie was getting on my nerves right up to the gas station scene. First of all, the use of the Shakespearean language in a modern setting DOES NOT WORK, period. It doesn't make sense in a modern setting. They call their guns swords for crying out loud! Second, the acting is terrible. The worst actor of them all was Tybalt. Third, they just act stupid. I hated just about everybody that starred in this ""masterpiece."" You see Mercutio dressed like a woman, the reason is never explained. I wanted to beat ... him because of his stupidity. You're better off watching the classic version, butI didn't really like that one either."
5,"""Exceptionaly romantic tragedy""","Me and my friends enjoyed the book. We also saw the movie. The book is well writen and we all liked the part when Romeo and Juliet died...even if that was the saddest part. We also liked the part when Juliet said: Romeo...whatever. The book was romantic, and interesting. It's one of those books that make you want to keep on reading. I recommend this great book and I hope whoever reads it enjoys it. END"
1,Leo rocks!,"Leo is a wonderful and talented actor, but the movie itself sucked.If Leo was not in it, it would have been horrible. Good thing for Leo! END"
2,"Flashy , Loud, and Empty","As a music video its wonderful but as a story it just doesnt work. The characters are shown in such a bland way and you really cant feel anything for them. It has no heart or deph. You get the impression that the director cared more about the surface of the movie than about its soul. Dicaprio really cant act either, hes just very boring and sounds as if he is trying to act, like someone in a high school play. Claire Danes wasnt quite so bad but she still wasnt very good. Noone really showed any emotion. The best movie based on Shakespeares play is the 1968 version."
1,"Oh Romeo, Romeo, Wherefore Art Thou.... Oh Make Me Puke!","I'm sorry people. This movie blows. It's awful. What were these people thinking?!. Why would they ruin a masterpiece like this story by filming this junk?. Claire Danes is the only saving grace of this boring, whorish film. If you want a good movie, rent the original. Pass this turkey."
5,IT'S A GREAT FILM,THIS VERSION OF Romeo & Juliet IS THE BEST IT HAS THE SAME LINES AND IT IS BROUGHT UP TO DATE. THIS MAKES IT EASIER FOR YOUNGER KIDS TO UNDERSTAND WHATS GOING ON AND EASIER FOR THE MTO UNDERSTAND CLASSIC WRITTING THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE AND LEONARDO LOOKS GREAT IN IT. BUT I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
1,Awful. Just awful.,"When I saw it in the theatre, I nearly walked out after the first 20 minutes. Several people who didn't mind losing their money did walk out. After the horrid gay transvestite musical number, the movie becomes merely dull.I never was much of a Shakespeare fan because the languange has changed so much over the centuries, but this movie took what was basically a decent play and made it into some sort of twisted West Side story wannabee.If you love Shakespeare, you'll probably like this twisted version. If you don't really care for the Bard, then avoid this one."
1,the worst movie EVER!!!,"Shakespeare would have rolled over in his grave when he saw this movie! the combination of overdramatic acting, chaos, and Elizabethan language in a present day setting is enough to make anyone roll over in their grave! the movie is so jam-packed with outrageously dream-like sequences that you'd have to be a fool to enjoy it. it goes by so fast that when you blink it's over. this movie proves that you can't take 15th century Europe and convert it to 20th century California."
4,past vs present,"The movie is arguably more appealing to the younger generation. I guess some fans of william shakespere and the classics had already set out to criticise the movie before they saw it, nothing but the original version would satisfy them. however, another group would have been looking forward to a this refreshing modified version. Even though the movie had lost that appealing ancientness, about it, it still held great uniqueness and funlike structure in its mismatch of past and present styles. for example, the scenery, props and clothing were a mix of both. I felt that it gave the show a more magical aura, as though it was a kind of caught in between the times. that was certainly interesting. Then, of course, there's shakesperes charm minus its oldness. hey, the movie kept the originals emotions. shakespere was getting a bit stuffy for this time and age and i guess this movie kept all its literary value while injecting some fun into it."
5,The best Romeo and Juliet for contemporary times,"Stunning visuals and great characters drive this movie. Who would have thought that anyone could improve on Shakespeare's original Romeo and Juliet - Baz Luhrmann, of course! This is classic Baz with his eye for saturated colors of everything from cars and tattoos to the sets and costuming. Wonderful, haunting music as well. It's a 10 in my book."
3,Close... But not quite,"This year, as a high school freshman, I was required to read Romeo and Juliet. After we read it, in its full form, my teacher thought it would be a treat to watch this modernized version fo the movie. It leaves out so much information, and, if anyone isn't completely familiar with the story of Romeo and Juliet, then much of thew action is hard to follow, since the dialogue is not only out of place but hard to understand. The filmography is beautiful, but there is so much that is misinterpreted or omitted that the movie doesn't quite measure up."
3,Romeo + Juliet,"This is a clever, well done adaption of the bard's most famous love story. Fast paced, with a cast of rising stars, it is an absolutely accurate version of the text. However, it does not do the play justice in many ways, and first time Romeo and Juliet viewers would be better watching one of the more traditional versions, in order to view the story as Shakespeare saw it. In spite of this, it is a very clever adaption, and quite worth spending a couple of hours on."
5,"""Although the tragic ending, it was beautful"".","""This is a great video I think it should be rated high up with 'Titanic' and 'Gone With the Wind'.It is one of the best romantic films I've seen.Great Music, great actors, geat story.Although the tragic ending, it was beautiful.I like it when especially when they got married.I can't believe Leonardo Dicaprio didn't become famous until 'Titanic'."""
1,no results,"Buy at your own risk, i am sure it has helped someone along the way but not anyone i know."
3,Playstation 2 Glow Controllers,Great price so I ordered 2. One was broke when I got it. The lights are very bright.Great for someone whoonly play the game for a short time. They fit the hands much better then other controllers do. It is a toss up. If you get them buy them at the store. Look at them. Handle them with care. It's good for older kids. Because they can play with no light on. Would not buy for kids under 13.
2,Cheap but...,This controll is very cheap but when you use it have a little problem. It have a pause when you push a buttom and the action on the tv so it is hard to play when you need a fast action/reaction of your controll.
2,"good story line, poor delivery","Good story, but kilmer and sorvino were weak. Compare to Meet Joe Black, which evoked incredible emotions due to the acting. At First Sight was slow, boring and gave me nothing to look forward to from scene to scene."
1,kilmer and sorvino have no chemistry,"After viewing this film (without falling asleep) I realized that I had seen it somewhere before. Yes, in the previews before it came out. If you saw the previews, you saw the film. I would rate this film a (0) if I could. Sorvino and Kilmer have absolutely no on-screen chemistry. Terrible casting. Sorvino looks like her hair needs washing and Kilmer is too much of a pretty boy for the role. Thumbs way down!"
2,You have got to be kidding me,"Ten minutes into this movie I was fast forwarding to see how it ended, it was boring and unimaginitive all the way through."
1,Rather dissapointing.,"Well I'd lie if I said other-wise. I like almost all of the Val Kilmer movies except this one. It sort of dragged, and wern't very happy durring the whole thing. It's a drama I know, but I guess I was dissapionted. It was dark and gloomy, and always raining. Of course that was a big part of the story but I hate drissles. I wont go so far as to say it was disgustingly boring, but it was close. Too close, so do what-ever, just don't say I didn't warn ya."
1,Second worst movie I ever saw!,"It goes on and on and on. First he has an idiotic smile on his face so we'll know how happy and well adjusted he is. Then this film slips into soft-core porn. The pacing is off by about two-thirds (WAY too slow to hold my interest) and then they bring in a so-called therapist who is insulting and completely inappropriate and keeps saying, ""Just kidding!"" These are usually very good actors, but don't waste your time even if you're a fan of Dr. Sacks work. You'll be disappointed AND bored."
1,This movie is boring,"I really did not like this movie, it is just soooo boring. I do strongly recomend you not to buy this movie nor even rent it."
4,Some Wonderful Moments in a So-So Movie,"This could have been such a good movie. Actually, there is a really good movie here surrounded by an extra hour of poorly written, manufactured hollywood melodrama. It's ""inspired by"" a real-life couple in an article by Oliver Sacks, as was ""Awakenings"" - one of my favorite movies, with Robert De Niro and Robin Williams.The first half-hour has some of the most wonderfully romantic and sensual (PG-13) scenes that I've ever seen. Mira Sorvino is really good, showing her broad range of acting skills after the terrific ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" (1997) and her great part in ""Mighty Aphrodite"" (1995). Val Kilmer is adequate - not great, but much better than some of the reviewers have stated here.So if you can overlook the hollywood crap that's forced into many of the later scenes (I've actually watched it twice, fast-forwarding through the objectionable scenes the second time), this film is definitely worth a look."
3,I guess this is a better Oliver Sack's story made into movie,"I love Oliver Sack's writings. He is a real intellectual who also writes beautiful prose about strange yet beautiful world of neurology. His books were made into a few movies and they were more or less a disappointment. I think this one might be a better one (especially compare to Awakening), although I can't help hoping that one day a geat director will turn one of Dr. Sack's hauntingly beautiful story into a fine movie.One minor thing about Sorvino. I found her to be adorable and loveable. However her state of the art make-up was very distracting. I know she is supposed to be a sophisticated new yorker but her $1000/hour makeup-artist perfected face (especially her multi colored eye shadows and Always perfected painted red mouth) in every frame of the movie distracted from her fine acting ability. Did anyone else felt the same way? maybe it was just me....:)"
3,"I agree, moved too fast. Could have been MUCH better.","It was a decent storyline, but it DID move too fast, and was not what I expected. :("
4,A memorable portrait !,"Based on a real story , this film is real artistic triumph . I do not agree with many people and even critics who state this picture is a soap opera . It contains many dramatic issues that invite you to think .How can we adapt to the real world inmersed in a dark world where the blindness imposses us its own roles ?This medical repport works out as a perpetuum mobile through the film , it is supported by a good script and a special chemistry generated for Mira Sorvino (I love her) and Val Kilmer in a very credible role as the blind man .The brief process in which he recovers the sight sense is a life lesson .Irwin Winkler caught the insights , and the inner conflicts of any man in a situation like this .Excellent photography and edition ."
3,Love is Blind,"Charming little movie about an architect (Mira Sorvino) whom falls in love with a blind Massage therapist (Val Kilmer) whilst on holliday at a weekend retreat. This is a good movie to watch if you are in a ""Sleepless in Seattle"" mood or a ""When Harry meet Sally"" frame of mind."
3,Val Kilmer is Wonderful,"There were parts of this movie that will make you wish that you were blind(and deaf) these are just all the parts that Mira Solvino was around for, I'm sorry she just can't do romanitic commidies.Kilmer was great playing a blind man who is given his sight and has no idea how to react to it. His performance at least is something everyone should see."
2,Insightless!,Not even Nathan Lane can lift this otherwise mediocre film out of ordinariness.The chemistry between Sorvino and Kilmer is just not believable no matter how many sculptures she finishes. I would have no problem in seeing Val in a villainous role however. This is one for the disability of the week sunday night tv movie. It just didnt gel...
2,Unmatched romance,"This has to be the dullest love stories since Til There Was You. Mira Sorvino was the only good actor of the entire movie. There was so many confusing plots and story lines especially the ending that was so stupid, it was like you watching the middle part of the movie, I have to say that this may go down in history for unrealistic, overachievment love stories of the decade. But there were a couple of good scenes but not quite to save At First Sight."
2,I used too many tissues to like this...,"""At First Sight"" is a miserably sappy film about a blind man who gains his sight and falls in love with a woman. I believe it was based on a true story, and congratulations for that man, but no congratulations for this movie. It's an obvious tearjerker, but there are too many scenes where you just want to bawl your eyes out to make it a feel-good movie. There's nothing redeeming about this film at all! My only compliments go to Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino, who do fine jobs with their characters. But other than that, ""At First Sight"" was terrible."
3,Ok movie but it is more of a romance then a drama.,This is a ok movie if you have wanted to see this movie then I say see it. But this is not a movie that you rush out to see. I say you can wait till it comes on tv.
3,Kilmer is amazing,"Kilmer gives a caring and powerful performance as a masagge therapist whose blind and encounters the lovely Mira Sorvino and they fall romantically in love, its just great, then Kilmer goes and gets his blind eyes fixed and then he can see but hes not adapted to the world with its shapes and sizes and then he goes blind again at the end. you cant take your eyes of Kilmer, you really care for his character and what hes going threw and Nathan Lane is great as the blind school teacher."
5,I love this movie !!,This movie is my kind of movie - Its so captivating and magical !!!! Decide for urselfthe chemistry between Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino is breath takingThe story is such a beautiful one - based on real life people toothis is what true love should be aboutBeing there for someone at their highest and darkest hourA real gem !!!
4,A Philosophical Theme,"Among other themes that are presented effectively, the movie portrays very credibly the complex relation between our images of things, how we think about them, and our sense of our identity. It would take me weeks to get my students to appreciate the crisis caused by a confrontation with images of things for which we have no concepts, a crisis which this movie sets in awesomely clear focus in a matter of minutes. A smart movie."
4,A great sophomore effort,"Following their awesome debut (""Land Of Opportunity"" in 1986), E*I*E*I*O tweaked their sound a bit for 1988's ""That Love Thang"" with the addition of horns to some songs and a hint of funkiness to tunes like the title track and ""Hey Cecelie."" Still, the essential sound remained intact and this album is only slightly less incredible than the first. Songs like ""Ya Ya Love"", ""Where You Go"" and ""You Can't Stay Here"" (which wasn't on the vinyl version) rock hard; ""Words Falling Down"", ""Sea of Light"" and ""Across The Tracks"" are as good as anything the band ever did.If you can find this record, buy it. Let's hope at some point someone eventually re-releases these two albums and/or anything else these guys ever recorded. No band this good should be this unknown and unappreciated."
4,"Very good ""touch feely"" book.","My Fuzzy Friends is a very good book for a toddler to get the ""feel"" of different animals. It is in a larger format than most such books, and has *excellent* illustrations, along with the requisite fluffy patch for a toddler to touch. Best of all, the text invites toddlers to interact in different ways with the picture, touch with your toes, nose, etc. As such, it is more 'educational' than any of the other fuzzy books that I have seen. Even my wife, who is always trying to curtail my book purchases, relented and agreed that it was a worthwhile purchase."
5,for crafters,This is the same thickness as memory glass and I am going to use this for charms using solder. Thanx.
3,Just plain glass slides.,I thought they were glass slides with prepared speciments when I bought this product. You may need to pay attention to this.
1,Bad Fit did not hold shape for a week,Bad Fit did not hold shape for a week had to use clips to hold on a 48 inch round table
5,experience of a lifetime,These 'you are there' recordings are beyond fantastic and beyond critical comment. Both life affirming and inspiring. Outstanding playing with an orchestra completely in sync with the conductors' wishes. A treasurable experience and unforgetable! Slow tempi end up not mattering.
3,Celibidache tackles the Russians,"Romeo and Juliet is enjoyable and some of the slow tempi seem just perfect once you get used to them, other times they don't quite work as well. However Pictures at an Exhibition loses its color under Celi's slow baton and is in many parts well nigh unlistenable.If you are looking for a great version of Romeo and Juliet, try Ovchinnikov's. Ormandy (paired with an indispensible version of Francesca di Rimini) is also worth seeking out."
5,Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds (Star Wars Roleplaying Game),Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds (Star Wars Roleplaying Game); it is what it is. A decent resource on known words for your D20 gaming until Disney comes out with something else
3,Only Okay,"I just finished this, and had did so only because it's a habit of mine to always finish a book I start. Based on other reviews I read, I expected much more, only to be disappointed. I found it to be somewhat disconnected, and I never really did get the point. The ending was particularly disappointing. I would not recommend this book."
4,A Great Book About Racism! In the old days....,"This book is slow-moving at first, but has an excellent ending. It's all about ignorance, patience, and revenge. It reads like a true story, but it makes me wonder...is it?"
5,well done,"Set in the South this well-crafted book tells story of small town living and scandal. Intimately drawn characters, careful details of daily living, and a severe revenge put it on my list of recommended books."
4,satisying story,"I just finished this book and really enjoyed it. It took me while to decide if I liked it or not. In the end, I decided that I did. It was really quite a satisfying read and a great story. Though somewhat bleak, I felt it was a true testament to family ties and bonds. I walked away with a real sense of history and rootedness. It's just too bad it had to be accompanied with so much bitterness and revenge. I would recommend this one to anyone who likes Southern stories."
4,Excellent for students of iai,"A good introduction to the more combat-oriented type of iai (Japanese swordsmanship). Ok, in Japanese, but it does not matter very much since this is the type of instructional video where the pictures says it all. Filmed at a beautiful temple site. What I miss perhaps are more close-ups when it comes to certain grips and stances - and slow motion footage - instead of having to use the slow motion button on the video over and over again. I have the 2nd kyu in Iaido (ZNKR seitei), and found this video about WWII-iai very useful in my search for combat-oriented techniques, which does not dominate in the more traditional Iaido."
1,A waste of time and money.,Maybe I missed something here... but this one was really bad. The instruction was non-existant for a non-Japanese speaker. And the examples of tecnique were not very impressive.
4,Fantastic - But what about the second part?,"All I can say about this book is that it is fantastic - The artwork is great, the storyline builds up well with some good action, but here's the problem: It ends on an almighty cliffhanger and the sequel is no longer available. I would give this book 5 stars except I don't know how the story ends... :-("
5,Something new,"Volume 1 introduces readers to the land of Warlands by introducing a great story and unbelievable artwork. The story is different type, but not hard to follow since it uses a lot of elements from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. The cast of characters is brought together well, and the Darklyte story is a setting for other Warlands events that happen down the road. Most action is in Volume 2, but this is still worth the money, especially if readers are tired of the typical superhero books. Highly reccomend this one"
4,Warlands: Not another medeval tale!,"Starts out slow, but there is something intriguing about this new take on the vampire/elves/knights story. Artwork is Beautiful. The story is engaging yet a little predictable, however there are some surprising plot twists. One problem is that the Narrative Text (font, color, and size) is hard to read. If you have a little extra pocket money, pick this one up."
5,Get ready to work your butt off!!,"This is another great video from Jeri Love. I am new to her videos and I am so glad that I read all the positive reviews and brought 3 of the videos.I work out 3 times a week and that is enough cause they are so intensed. You will feel the burn,espcially with all the squats and lounges.I am a big fan now."
4,Great workout,"I'm not a beginner to working out, and I love weights. Still, this was challenging! I'd recommend it for people who are stuck in a weight-loss or fitness plateau. I especially enjoyed the nutrition advice and the fact that Jari is working out alongsside refular people, not fiteness pros or models."
5,omg! love this dvd,"i love her period, she has a very likable personality,and she will really work you with this dvd. i work out 6 days a week and have to hit the stop button, especially with the leg parts, it really works you."
5,What a discovery !,"I am 56. I taught aerobics for 12 years and ruined my knee. I went into body building and LOVED it but got too bulky. I was doing 30 lb dumb bell bicep curls and LOOKED like it. I had huge, bulky muscles. I just discovered Jeri a few weeks ago and LOVE her. I am losing bulk and weight. Her bicep sequence with 5-7 pound weights is a killer. I have purchased 5 of her dvd's and love her so much that I have sent my daughter, a Stanford athlete, the same dvds. Jeri is amazing. THNXS Jeri ! I am a HUGE fan."
3,Blah,"I know this is a little picky but OMGoodness this workout was so boring. Am I the only one that wants to get in there, get a hard workout done and get on with my day? Sure all the moves are good, but if you are in good shape already this isn't going to get you sore. It's just going to drive you crazy with how long it is. And I agree with the other review that says these people look like robots. What is wrong with looking like you are working out hard? I need something much faster, more energizing and harder. I want to walk away proud that I just finished the workout, dripping with sweat.If you are a beginner, this is a good DVD to show you how to do moves."
3,Pretty Much The Same As Her Previous Ones!!!,"This DVD was a waste of money in this time of recession. If you have any, any of her other previous DVD's it's the same exercises with less redundancy, so do yourself a favor and save the cash in these hard times and stick with what you already have, that is unless you want to see her new workout outfit, that's one of the only things that new about this DVD."
5,tears you down to build you back up,"This video has 6 sections: legs, chest, back, shoulders, triceps, and biceps. Each section is 2 or 3 (for legs it is 4!) exercises that last 5 about minutes each which really wear each muscle down until you can barely lift any weight at all. By the time you are done working out a body part, you are really glad to be moving on. I consider that a good thing in an exercise video, because it pushes me harder than I would push myself.There isn't really any cardio, though. However, if I want cardio I can do the Get Ripped 1000 workout. This one is great for all around strength and endurace."
3,Not my favorite of Jari's dvds.,"This is a good workout and I love Jari too but I prefer all of Jari's other workouts over this one. I guess supersetting is just not for me. Also, in the lunge section near the beginning you hold your feet in the same place for a long time (in a lunge position). I found this really irritated my ankle and foot while holding in back in that position for so long. I have only done this video once and it will probably be a long time before I pull it out again (when I forget how much I did not care for it). It is really HARD though. Personally, I would highly recommend Get Ripped to the Core or even the original Get Ripped. Those 2 are my faves.."
3,Surprisingly Good!,"""Lorna"" is revolutionary in that it showed full frontal nudity and carried a plot line, Meyer's first film incorporating the two. Originally a nudie film maker, he was clearly infatuated with big breasted women. The lead character (real life stripper, Lorna Maitland) keeps us entertained on the screen with her well endowed figure, despite the slow storyline. Once the story finally kicks into gear developing into its shocking climax, it becomes surpisingly good entertainment. All I can say this was a rather pleasant experience. I've seen Russ Meyer's later videos (B.V.D., Beneath the Valley of the UltraVixens) and was expecting nothing but sex and violence. But after all, this was 1964. Give it a try, if you're not a prude!"
5,Nice scissors set,Great scissors set especially for the money. Always losing scissors in the house so these are in one drawer. We are very pleased with this set.
1,"A ""Best Of"" No-No","Consolidating the accomplishments of one of the greatest bands in rock 'n' roll history onto one CD is criminal. Rhino Records does a great job with their ""Complete Greatest Hits,"" etc., but this collection is incomplete, misrepresentative, and poorly arranged. Songs like ""Doolin' Dalton"" make the cut, but ""In the City"" (which, for some reason, was not on the second Greatest Hits collection) is again overlooked. Admittedly, the Eagles have had some strange collections (""After the Thrill is Gone"" being included on the second Greatest Hits despite its 1975 release). So, because my review has been as helter-skelter as the arrangement of tunes on this CD, I will leave you with the recommendation of buying the individual albums or Greatest Hits collections."
2,The Very Best Of The Eagles,"I'm not too happy with the condition of the cd,not too mention the case!It was scratched and the case was broken.I would like to reoreder it,but not at this time.I love the Eagles music!Karen"
5,Remastered for an Even Better Sound!,This is the best compilation of the Eagles' work on one disc that's out there. The sound has been very well remastered and the track selections are pretty much the best that they've even done. This Japanese version also has a booklet with all the lyrics both in English and in Japanese too! Highly recommended for all you Eagles' fans both old and new who want to get the gist without having to get all the albums.
3,Eagles In One CD?,"No, never do this to one of the greatest band in history. The reason I bought this CD in 1993 to 4 was that I was lured by some of the tracks that Part I and II missed such as Tequila Sunrise or James Dean. If you are a decent music fan and know it well about how to appreciate music this compilation is the one to avoid. Nevertheless if you are new to Eagles and enjoy current artists like Backstreet Boys, Enimem Westlife or so it can be recommendable. At least buying Eagles is better than buying none.My favorite Eagles tracks of all time are included such as Take It Easy, Peaceful Easy Feeling, Desperado, One Of These Nights, and New Kid In Town."
2,"Butler fans, don't rush to buy","Gerard Butler fans, don't rush out to buy this one. He is not in it. It's a glitch on the part of Amazon. If you did buy it and are still looking at the extras in an attempt to find him, just relax and forget it. Eat popcorn. This one is a pale copy of a 1940s film with Richard Widmark that you may like much, much better. Widmark could have menaced snarly rings around ol' 'You talkin' to me?'"
3,FUNNY TALE ABOUT A LOVABLE LOSER.,"""Night And The City"" is not a great drama, neither a great comedy, but it is an entertaining and funny movie. Robert De Niro is Harry Fabian, a loser who tries to put his hands in more things that he can really manage, and Jessica Lange is Helen Nasseros, Harry's love interest, despite she is a married woman.As the story unfolds, there will be several tragedies in the path of our two antiheroes, all these tragedies are a combination of drama, farce and comedy. Definitely, ""Night And The City"" is not a classic, but it is a funny movie, recommendable for all the fans of the great Robert De Niro that are trying to see the entire Robert De Niro catalogue (like myself). At the end of the day this is an entertaining movie."
3,"OLD-FASHIONED TRIBUTE TO GANGSTER FILMS ala JOHN GARFIELD, or BROADWAY DANNY ROSE MEETS RUPPERT PUPKIN","As the title of this review suggests that NIGHT AND THE CITY is kinda like BROADWAY DANNY ROSE MEETS RUPPERT PUPKIN; or JOHNNY from MEAN STREETS if he was a shmuck lawyer instead of Pure Anarchy. I'm big fans of Cliff Gorman and Alan King. And JESSICA LANGE will always be a Hollywood goddess to me. It's just an old-fashioned gangster melodrama of the type Warner Brothers put out in the 1930s and 1940. DeNiro was in the John Garfield role, and Jessica Lange was in the Ann Sheridan role. Cliff Gorman was played by George Raft, or Bogart. And Alan King was played by E.G. Robinson. Jack Warden was played by Alan Jenkins. He loses his mind before the big fight and dies of a heart attack. NIGHT AND THE CITY is a tribute to the old fashioned classic gangster films."
3,PREDICTABLE BUT ENTERTAINING,"This movie could've been great except for the plot being so predictable. You know everything's destined to fail from the get-go but still, it's very entertaining due to the dynamic stars and the basic setup. DeNiro is very funny here and even the cameos (the one with Regis is amusing) are mixed in well. A real New York story that can't help being depressing but one of my favorites. Just can't rate it better because it doesn't have any surprises."
3,"DeNiro's Good, But, Where is Great Original 1950s Version?","This version of Night and the City is a good movie mainly because of the performaces by Robert DeNiro and Jessica Lange. The direction is average. However, I give a more generous opinion if I hadn't seen the original 1950 version directed by the great Jules Dassin, and starring Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney. The 1950 version is a masterpiece, to say the least, and is one of the greatest film noirs ever made. Although the 1950 version is a masterpiece, It is nearly impossible to find a copy for sale anywhere. IF BY A MIRACLE SOMEONE OR ANYONE ANYWHERE HAS ANY INFO. ON WHERE I CAN PURCHASE A COPY OF THE 1950 NIGHT AND THE CITY, I WOULD BE FOREVER APPRECIATIVE!"
4,Good but not the best,"This represents the completion of the final three Dvorak symphonies that Davis recorded for the LSO Live label. I think it confirms that Davis is natural with Dvorak, although I have some reservations. First, the sound is a little bit too recessed for my taste and certainly more so than the recordings of the 8th and 9th. The first movement is very strong with the climatic moments given the proper weight and dramatic tension. The second and third movements are fine, no new insights here, but definitely well played. I feel as though the Finale could have been brought off better, the strings don't really sing through enough and it tends to become a bit too weighty toward the conclusion, as Davis slows things down significantly. Compare this to Dohnanyi/Cleveland on Decca or Szell/Cleveland on Sony and you will immediately notice the difference. So, a good solid choice, but certainly not at the top."
3,A little thin if you ask me...,"First off I'll say this where is it written that ""Glamour"" Photography is the same thing as nude photography. Granted most of the photographs are tasteful but this isn't a book you'd want the kids to get a hold of.The author is not the master glamour photographer. Since his information is second hand the book suffers. There is some good general information about releases etc. This is by no means a world class book on Glamour/Fashion Photography. Look somewhere else for that. I almost sent it back but decided to keep it on the shelf.Kurt"
3,"Attractive, but narrow","This is an attractive sandal, but they must run very narrow because the wide size is not wide. I own two pairs in two different colors and it is the same for both. Also, the sole is very low, so it does not offer much cushion when walking. I will say I am very impressed with Shoe Mall. Their prices are great, they deliver fast and, although they have limited sizes for each shoe, they have a great selection. I ordered the same shoes from them (in different colors) that I have previously ordered from Nordstrom on sale and the savings are considerable."
3,Missing a few things,"Product is big, as expected, but doesn't come with a holster or anything to attach it to your belt"
3,Biased review,Item was shipped fast and packed well! i cant give it a real review cause thankfully i have never had to use it. Something like this is a backup you never want to have to use it. I just hope if the need arises that it works.
4,To Trust A Stranger,"The book starts out fast pace and funny. It continued to keep my interest until about halfway through when it started to lag. I feel the character build up could have been somewhat stronger when Julie started to question Mac. The question of what happened to Mac's brother does keep the reader wondering and surprises do continue until the end. I gave it a four instead of five because I feel it did have some lag and the conversation could have picked up this, by using humor as was used in the beginning."
2,Cliche driven,"I actually listened to the audiobook, it may not have bothered me as much if I had read the book, but Robards uses cliches to the blithering end...you keep thinking it will be over, that she will write something that is a plain sentence, but no...I guess The End could have been written as a cliche'. I didn't listen.Julie - I hate to think SC could crown such a ditz...IQ is required for Miss SC because she is competing for Miss America. In fact I knew a former Miss SC & I think she'd be insulted. Regardless, the story may be okay but the cliches really ruin it.This author loves chiches, I know that, but this is the worst. I just dare some of you 4 & 5 star reviewers to listen to it.I have listened to several of her books in the recent past."
5,Couldn't Put Book Down!!,This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The plot and the romance go hand in hand. This is a must read!!!
1,"STUPID, PREDICTABLE, LOUSY STORY LINE, BORING","We have had so many tough world events lately that I decided I would like to read a foolish ""beach book"". I can't believe this writer really has any fans - they really need to get a life. Give me a break - this author must laugh all the way to the bank writing such dribble that people actually pay to read. I picked this book up for free - thank god I didn't pay a penny for it. I always force myself to finish a book once I start it - this was a tough one and it ended just as I figured it would. There were no surprises."
4,All in all a good read.,The main problem I had with this book is Julie. She was definitely not the sharpest tack in the box if after 8 years of marriage she hadn't figured out what hubby was like! She was also way too obsessed with her appearance.I loved Mac & the scenes of him in drag were a scream!
1,not a good read,"I have read many of Ms.Robards books and they were all enjoyable. But not this one. I kept reading and hoping it would get better, but it didn't."
1,Disappointed,"I have read several of Karen Robards books, some better than others, but this one was by far the worst. The plot was thin, the caracters shallow and the descriptions repetitive. Too much sex (very graphic) and not enough story."
4,Refreshing and fun.,"I read this book in two days and had fun time reading it. Julie Carlson is afraid her husband is having an affair and hires Mac or (Debby) as she called him to spy on him to find out if her assumption is true. After this turn of events everything goes out of control for both of them. But to me my favorite character would have to be Josaphine, Mac's little Toy Poodle. I enjoyed her personality, and spunk,and at the end she jumps in and nearly saves both of their lives by attacking Bast one of the bad guys. I really enjoyed this book and will enjoy reading more of her books. I already have Beachcomber in my List at home waiting for me. I highly recommend this book. Read it and enjoy."
1,Plot never thickens...what plot,"This book is a bore and you could probably read a few chapters in the beginning, maybe one in the middle and then the last and feel you have completed your read. The story telling reads like a teenage harlequin romance book. Definitely a beach book you could leave in the sand."
3,Take this one to the beach,"This ""guilty pleasure"" paperback belongs in your beach bag. It features ""flames of passion,"" complete with hot tongues, silky thighs, and solid biceps. Yes, it really is that corny! But if you're looking for a thriller with no redeeming value other than that it's a light, fun read, this is it. The plot itself had lots of twists and turns and while the characters were stereotypes, in a book like this that adds to the charm and fun. My only real complaint about this great trashy novel is the inclusion of Josephine in the most dangerous escapades. It was highly manipulative to put a dog in harm's way like that, and inconsistent, too. If our hero doesn't take Grandma's poodle with him to drag bars, why would he include her on a shootout with a hitman? Instead of putting the pooch in peril, Mac, leave her home!"
5,I can't believe that some people did not like this book!,"This is my first Karen Robards book and as a result of reading it, she is now my newest favorite author. The way in which is combines suspense, humor, and sizzling chemistry between the hero and heroine is phenomnenal. After reading Linda Howard's ""Mr. Perfect"" I thought that I would never find a romantic supsense that equaled it. Luckily for me, Karen proved me wrong. You go Girl!"
5,Very Suspenseful and intriguing,"In To Trust A Stranger, you're drawn in within the first few sentences. If you like romance, suspense, mystery, and action all in one, then this book is a must read! All the twists and turns make it hard to lay the book down. Julie's failing marriage and new relationship with Mac are exciting. The end is amazing, i recommend this book to all women, i don't think guys would enjoy all the emotions that come with sex that are displayed in the novel. lol!"
5,An Excellent Read!,"To Trust A Stranger by Karen Robards is absolutely wonderful.This is the first book that I have read by the author. The book is a combination of mystery and romance. It is simply amazing how the author had a seemingly perfect family involved with so many secrets. Julie Carlson and Sid Carlson marriage was based on a lie from the beginning. Julie ended up trusting a total stranger, Mac, who was a private investigator. One of the best parts in this story was about the love for Mac's dog named, Josephine. If you love a good story, you just have to read this book. The reader plans to go back and read Mrs. Robards previous novels. Recommend her to your friends!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I was a big fan of all her older romances. ""To Trust a Stranger"" was too violent to be considered much of a romance. The plot starts out with two violent deaths and ends with about four more. A little ""hot sex"" is thrown in between the violence ..."
3,Good processor but heats up when running lots of graphics,"I got this cpu 4 years ago, still working great but had many issues when running Windows movie maker and streaming movies online. Processor would heat up although the cpu fan does compensate for this but still runs hotter than I think it should. With Movie Maker kept getting freeze ups and would have to shut down the program frequently. Non Amazon seller did not inform me of this potential problem at time of purchase and I told them I was going to be working with photographs frequently. Also get trails when dragging images. Installed a 512MB graphics card which improved performance somewhat but still have freeze ups with Windows Movie Maker and still get some trails when moving images.Also still have issues with the graphics icons on task bar filling out properly, very slow. Have 2GB Ram installed."
5,Bang for the buck,"Estupendo cpu con capacidad de overclock increible. Incluso por aire, alcanza frecuencias altisimas."
1,Kinda odd,"This is one of the cheapest CPU u could fine, with some of the C2D features, lacks on some but there not such important. With this CPU u should not worry in getting good ram, because of its low FSB u can use cheap ram too."
1,Pointless,"Do NOT buy this CPU, is worthless, with better options out there u should look at the 4MB of cache CPUs, thats right this is cut-in-half-feats-unvaluable cpu. Stay away from this and wait for AMDs K10."
2,Not so good,I saw this movie on a flight between Las Vegas and Chicago. The turbulance over the desert was the only real thrill I felt. This movie and being stuck between the aisle and window seat - now that's entrapment.
4,Who traps who?,"The casting of this film is what give it a edge. While the plot twists keep it interesting, it is the same old story. Boy meets girl, girl and boy steal stuff, boy gets girl. Good direction and camera work add to the action and plot scenes to make it well balanced."
4,A Nice Romance Movie,This movie was a really good romance film. Connery and Jones were at there best in this film. I am a Catherin Zeta-Jones fan big time and I really liked this movie because of her. It has a really good storyline to back it up. At first I didn't know who stole the art work at the beginning of the movie and to tell you the truth I still haven't figured out who it was. That is why I wish that they would tell you. The one good thing that none of you will expect is what happens in the end. I am not going to spoil it for you but for those of you who have seen it you know what to expect right? HA HA HA leave the ppl who haven't seen it in suspense.It's a good movie so I suggest that u rent it.Mild Swearing Mild Sex Scenes Not much more
3,Good to See Connery,"It is always good to see Sean Connery but he and Zeta-Jones have very little to no chemistry as a team if that was intended. The film starts off well but their chemistry or relationship is rather strange if one even cares about that aspect. Caper films such as this have been done much better. The preparation scenes for the caper are a bore and look pretty unprefessional for characters who are supposed to be in this line of work. What this film needed was a good director and a good editor as well. The film has a few good scenes thanks to Connery, but the film never reaches its potential."
3,ENTERTAINMENT VALUE,"Catherine Zeta-Jones is her gorgeous self here, ensnaring men on both sides to achieve her aims. She portrays an insurance investigator and goes undercover to catch Sean Connery's aging thief character in the act, but she is really planning to use him in an even bigger heist. Of course you find out in the end that there has been more double crossing going on than meets the naked eye. There is a lot of interesting scenery in the film, a lot of Catherine looking beautiful. But overall the film is quite intelligent and passably believable in the way it is carried out. It has its happy ending, so it is not by any means perfect, but it will be riveting enough to keep you watching until the end."
2,TERRIBLE BLU RAY TRANSFER!,"I am only going to review the Blu Ray disc. The image quality is poor, most occasions it's blurred. Especially when the film starts I end up wondering why it gets blurred.I had the same issue with Die Hard 1 and 2 and In the Line Of Fire. Why do I get the feeling the they just transferring the image from dvd to Blu Ray or using some type of Noise Reduction which actually worsens the picture quality,"
3,reminded me of the old Mission Impossible series.,"Fast action, nicely done updated high-tech version which reminded me of the old Mission Impossible shows. Another comparison that popped up in my mind was a relation to a 1964 flick called ""Topkapi"" whose plot consisted of a bunch of theives (albeit amatuers), that try to steal a jewel encrusted dagger from a sultan statue in an Instanbul museum. However, like others who have viewed Entrapment I found it necessary to use the ""backspace"" button several times throughout the movie,in order to put the plot together in my mind. Also, I wish they would have not breezed through the high tech computer Y2K heist using very fast takes. Still it is a recommended flick."
3,Connery saves the day,"The only reason to watch this movie (unless you are a guy) is Sean Connery. His acting ability and some cool gadgets are about the only things that keep your attention through the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones can't act. I've never seen her in another movie so I don't know if she is always this bad, but watching her give her dialogue is like watching paint dry. She's stunning to look at even when she comes up from a swim with full makeup on, but she has a hard time giving any lines with punch. The movie dragged in some parts, but was entertaining overall. The Connery/Zeta-Jones love interest wasn't believable or very well developed. The billion dollar oversight at the end wasn't believable either. Y2K or not a billion dollars is a billion dollars. I'd recommend a rental on this one."
1,Dreadful,"The only reason to see this movie is to admire Catherine Zeta-Jones' immense talent, and I'm not talking about her acting here. Otherwise, the plot is just too farfetched and the story develops much too slowly to create any real interest in it. I kept hitting the 'time remaining' button on my VCR to see how much longer I had to endure that farce."
1,1/2 A STAR ACTUALLY,"I'm normally a leniant guy when it comes to films. I enjoy Arnold Schwarzenneggar films and can sit through Superman films but Entrapment bored me to death. If my bike wasn't chained to my friend's I would have left. I recommend this film to insomniacs only. Use the money you would spend on this to chuck at a walll, it would be a better use!SERIOUSLY THE WORST FILM OF THE DECADE!"
1,Entrapment = superstar + superjugs,"Sean Connery should be flogged for appearing with a no-talent, one-hit-wonder like Zeta-Jones. I suspect (and hope) each night he laid his head to pillow, that he grit his teeth and imagined ways of breaking his contract. Small town high school students show more vitality and verve than she does in this role. She was soooo terrible in this part, that, thankfully, it distracted me from the amateurish directing, wandering plot lines, and pedestrian script. Mr. Connery, your talent and charisma cannot pull others out of the swamp of mediocrity, even if they are engaged to a Hollywood bigshot."
3,Stay Retired,"Dude, Sean Connery needs to stay retired. Seriously. You can't steal anymore. An insurance investigator and art thief played by Catherine Zeta-Jones (too hot to even by near the retired guy) is assigned to check out the retired burglar. They join forces after much bickering and do a good job. Then they go for a huge Y2K bank theft. This movie moved too slowly for me to even care about what was going on. Zeta-Jones would be a good Bond girl, but not for Connery. Blasphemy! Ultra funny Ving Rhames was also in this movie, but he made a couple of appearances. The ending left an opening for a sequel, but I hope they just leave this as it is. No more artifact, young woman movies!"
3,Entertaining but no Oscar nominations I'm sure,"I agree with what most of you have said. Not well written perhaps and a definite stretch of the imagination but then, aren't most action-packed thrillers? As to whether or not Catherine can act, well I guess I got lost in those big dark eyes, not to mention her smile, and anything seemed possible."
2,hmmmm......,"This movie was OK. Just OK. There was really no excitement in it- the last Y2K scam scene was really pretty badly done. But the part of this movie really bugs me is that Sean Connery is so old!!!!! I don't mean he's too old to be acting or whatever, he just seems so perverted in this movie (jones/connery sex: the most disgusting thing i could think of and never want to see again). Let's not add to the other fact: there's absolutely NO chemistry between the two leads. But whatever: if you're a die hard action fan and don't mind watching sean connery make out on the floor with catherine zeta jones, this movie's pretty good."
2,THIS MOVIE HAD MORE TWISTS THAN A PRETZEL!,"I had high hopes for this movie when it first came to theaters. Sean Connery is quite a good actor and Catherine Zeta-Jones is quite beautiful. But Sean Connery's acting and Catherine Zeta-Jones' beauty couldn't save this film. It started out quite well with the initial heist. The director does a good job pulling you into the story. Then, he takes a turn for the worst and gives you the exact opposite of the criminal you thought you knew all along. It just doesn't add up. If they had just stuck with one twist it could have been a great film. But no! They had to out-twist even a pretzel! What were the screenwriters thinking! Don't see this movie unless you like being not confused by many twists that were meant to confuse and say ""Hey, this is a great film."" Trust me on this one. I hope this is helpful. If it isn't and you love this film, then you have my sincere condolences."
3,Nicely acted but weak and contrived story line,"Connery is good as Connery, Zeta Jones is alluring, and there are some good action sequences, but the story fails. It has too many perfect coincidences, contrived events, and techno-conveniences (impossible events made possible by some technical trick too advanced for us ordinary folk to understand). For the same basic plot (brilliant, debonair thief chased by sexy insurance investigator), The Thomas Crown Affair is a better bet."
5,Great action,This movie was excellent. It keeps you guessing till the end trying to figure out who the bad guy really is. The suspense and action are wonderful. I loved watching the planning and preparations they took for their heists. Very intelligently done and I'd watch it again and again.
3,"good, but not my kind of movie","I had never been so confused about a movie before in my life before I saw this one. You keep on wondering who is on who's side and when. And the thieves are the good guys. And...well, basically, this is not my kind of movie. ciao."
2,When does the trap go off?,"another brain dead movie definitly molded after thomas crown affair. same plot same idea some concept. and nearly as bad. it has a little more action than crown affair but it lacks any real substance, which is a shame because it could have been great. the ending is weak and much of the film is very unbelievable. maybe they thought the actors would carry the film. i'd look elsewhere and give this one a miss."
4,Entrapment was wonderful!,I just saw Entrapment last night. It was extrmelly fun to watch. Connery and Zeta-Jones work very well togtether. Get ready for a surprise ending.
3,"Action-packed movie, but typical lousy transfer by Fox","First of all, the DVD transfer is *NOT* anamorphic. I repeat it is NOT 16:9 enhanced. The film is 2.35:1 letterboxed (to 4:3.) Another Titanic mess-up with the packaging, you could say.The transfer quality is average, but what do you expect for a cheap Fox SS/SL (single-side/single-layer) conversion. Minor compression artifacts are noticeable throughout the movie, the dark scenes exhibit some film grain (but that's FILM grain, not commpressino artifact.)Oh what about the movie, well if you like Sean Connery, you'll like Entrapment. The plot has its share of twists and turns (and loopholes, glaring omissions, misrepresented technology ... ""Y2K"" give me a break)"
2,What a dissapointment,"The DVD itself is quite nice With a nice graphical display and neat interactive menus. Unfortunate the movie itself dissapoints.There have been many better movies in this type of Genre. Goodness, later in 1999 we had a better movie in the same vein when a remake of _The Thomas Crown Affair_ hit the theatres.Sean Connery did well enough, but I just couldn't suspend my disbelief to make it through the plot, or to believe in Catherine Zeta-Jones' character.If you are a Connery fan, and thought _Medicine Man_ was good then get this movie, otherwise I really cannot reccommend this film."
