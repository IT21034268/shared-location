4,Companion Gardening,"If you want to move beyond just planting flowers and vegetables, this is a great book about what plants actually make other plants happy and help nourish each other. Some plants actually provide protection from pests for their adjacent companions. The author also throws in some additional tidbits about little known gardening facts. An enjoyable read."
3,"not bad somewhat corny, girls aren't bad","Beverly Hills Vamp is a somewhat entertaining movie with standard B-rated effects and of course plenty of skin to show. The acting doesn't really matter in a movie like this so don't take it too serious on that matter. I've seen lots of movie like this, and well, i'd have to say this was actually the best of all of them. Some scenes were somewhat funny, others were just plain corny."
2,Little difference,I ordered both a medium and a fine set I would not suggest doing this as the difference between the medium and fine is very small. I had a hard time telling the difference. This was disappointing. They look to be hand made so there is some variation from file to file but for the price to be expected. If you are looking for a good general purpose file set I would order the medium (H2566). If you really want a fine riffler file set expect to pay a lot more.
1,"Too coarse, not fine","Steelex offers Coarse, Medium, and Fine riffler rasp sets. I ordered the Coarse and the Fine sets. The Coarse has coarse, very agressive, teeth. But the fine set has almost the same coarseness as the Coarse set. I wanted something almost consistent with a metal file sort of teeth for final wood carving finishing. The ""fine"" set is too coarse for my needs in carving wood. I am not satisfied with it. You get what you pay for. I should have read your reviews before I bought this."
5,Fine and medium riffler rasps,Rifflers were what I expected. Function as expected. What more could I expect? Working intricate shapes in hardwood isn't easy.
3,"Good All-Around Title, However Not a Must Buy","Reviewed by Priscilla Ing, Howard Elementary, Eugene SDFor more visit www.lane.k12.or.us/bookreviewThis is a collection of poems representing seventeen poets. Softly colored, realistic illustrations by Layne Johnson enhance the varied themes of the many poems about grandmothers and grandfathers. Some deal with a childs descriptions of his/her grandparent and some are shared memories of grandparents who have passed or were never known personally. These poems could be used as examples in a study of poetry or shared at a grandparents day program. Its construction follows the traditional format, with an index of first lines and a short review of each contributing poet. The book itself seems to be more appropriate in a personal collection rather than a school."
1,TV Armoire,"The armoire arrived with the doors damaged and a nick on the top. I was sent new doors but they didn't fit. Frustrated, I accepted the promised $175.00 off to keep the doors, knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later. I have yet to receive this refund. The delivery was also a major problem. There was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go. There was no way I could get this furniture in my house alone, so I tipped him to bring it in for me. I will never buy anything from this company again!!!!!!!"
5,Well worth it!,"Great quality. Easy to install with all the hardware included. I'm very happy with the fit, finish, and especially the performance gains."
1,Bad is an Understatement,"Caviat: The author does say that this book is to be used in conjunction with an instructor; a supplement. After I opened the box, I carefully took a sweep through the book, repackaged it and sent it back. The quality is poor in every aspect: layout, text, narration, printing and binding. It is a total waste for anyone even if you want to have one of everything in your library. This book CANNOT be used without an instructor....so why purchase it? It does nothing on its own. It is without merit. Get Kang Uk Lee's book on Tang Soo Do. It is as good as it gets for commonly available texts."
4,Ernie Hawkins -Blind Willie McTell,"Ernie Hawkins presents and instructs well as well as being a v. fine guitar player himself. Perhaps its not strictly necessary to go into all the 12 string detail and retuning - which is difficult to follow anyway as he assumes a lot of the learner who is used to playing six srings - but it illustrates his reverence to the original and one can easily adapt. Not that interested in the bottle neck pieces, but first tunes are great, and as always, one benefits by being able not only to learn these McTell pieces but adapt bits and pieces and techniques to other tunes by MCtell and other artists, which I'm sure Hawkins would expect."
2,In-depth actor performance,"I first saw Xtro 2:The Second Encounter when looking for my favorite actor(Nicholas Lea who plays Baines).My first impression was Aliens ripoff, but as I watched it for the first time I saw a storyline which was different from aliens and had potential but sadly was neglected by second rate director Harry Bromley Davenport. Jan-Micheal Vincent gives a decent performence as also does Nicholas Lea but that is about all it has going for it."
1,"utter crap, but i like that.","normally id give a film that i enjoyed so much a high star rating, but in this case i must expose it for the crime it is to movie lovers.firstly, im a b-movie fan and this one rocked my socks off; shoddy acting, pitiful and repetitive sets, embarrasing dialogue and a 'script' to match. i found the movie a pleasant and fun rollercoaster of action- but thats in my opinion, in anyone elses i can imagine the cruel taste of $2 down the drain to be quite bitter.bottom line, avoid unless you have a thing for terrible (and easily mockable) films. sadly id have to say this is one of my favorites.if you DO stumble upon this film keep an eye out on the 'jedburg' actor, that guys going places ;)"
1,Rated one star as no zero star available,"I was tricked into watching this movie. I had not seen the original Xtro. I was not familiar with the dircector. I read only the skimpy SCI-FI description of the movie in the yahoo tv online schedule which read, in total: ""The sole survivor of a parallel-world trip joins the woman in charge of another one gone wrong."" Endquote! I am a fan of alternate world stories, having had one published. In view of all of the above, I sat down before my 32"" tv, put the taped movie into the vcr, and prepared to watch a decent action movie -- I thought. I saw Jan-Michael Vincent in a couple of other movies since his character in ""airwolf"" and I think he should have quit after the series ended. I found myself fast-forwarding much of the movie wanting to get it over with. I only wanted to see how it came out not what happened to make it come out. Not recommended for anyone. Review based on the vcr recording from the SCI-FI channel January 31, 2005."
2,Lukewarm,"After reading ""A Little Knowledge"", I became a fan of this author. I bought and gifted more than 35 books PERSONALLY. However, the treatment of the subject here does not come with the same lucidity that I have come to expect. I wish that a re-writing can take place with more 'flavour'."
2,Expected more from Milwaukee,"Very disappointed with this tape measure. The scale on the tape is inches/ feet on one side, and metric on the other. While it may seem a simple matter of moving the tape above or below the mark to measure in your preferred scale, it becomes a pain in practice; it would be far easier if both sides of the tape were in inches. The stop button on the tape is also not ergonomically placed. It is too high, causing me to juggle the tape a bit to get at it. The magnetic tip seems a good idea, but it is uncanny how many unwanted places it will attach itself to. It can be useful, but I found it annoying overall. I used a Big Johnson tape measure previously, which I managed to break, and it was miles ahead of this item both in the clarity of the scale on it, and the stop button. I would buy another Johnson tape measure but oddly, Amazon has dropped them from their availability list."
5,need to know!,"I havent heard the soundtrack, but does anyone know what the artist and name of the song was that was played during the previews for transporter 2????? it almost sounds like hot action cop, or saliva, but i checked and its not. if you know can you just post it on a review??? thanks..."
3,Can't find a song from movie,"I am looking for the orchestral song when he is on the chase on the highway above water. It definitely has a signature sound to it and I may have heard it before? It only plays for a little bit and I cannot seem to find it! Other than that, this disc has about 2 other songs that are good to me."
3,Not as good as the first movie's soundtrack,"First off, no, the song in the trailers is not on this album. The album, however, isn't a total waste. I'd say slightly more than half the tracks are pretty good. My personal fav is Kate Nauta's song. That girl not only kicks butt in the movie, but she can rock! \m/Whereas the first movie's album, however, is full of good jams, this one is burdened by the instrumental tracks. The formula they used for the first album worked well and they should've stuck to it. And the song in the trailers should have been included on the soundtrack."
2,Summer House,"We got this because we heard it was similar to Enchanted April, but were very disappointed. The storyline seems to be going one way, but then throws in a disturbing event which disrupts the expectations previously built up. The viewer feels like she or he has been toyed with. There are no positive men in this film, all gross or murderous or selfish. The vulgar ending is a far cry from Enchanted April's light, positive purity. If you liked Enchanted April, don't bother with this one."

4,summer house,"Charming story of a friendship between an older woman with a past and a repressed younger woman who fears being trapped in a conventional life. The character Lily (Jeanne Moreau) is unforgettable. Excellent British cast. Similar in feeling to ""Tea With Mussolini"" and ""Enchanted April""."
4,Never in Hollywood!,"A very funny little movie. The ending could never have happened in a Hollywood production . . it is a classic, stereotypical French gem. Everyone gets their up-commance. Jeanne Moreau is perfectly cast and is a delight to watch. See it when you want something to smile at, or to laugh with."
4,"Difficult to find, but well worth the hunt!","Since I am a great fan of both Jeanne Moreau and Joan Plowright, this movie is a delight to watch. The two actresses play wickedly off one another -- one all smiles and charm, the other -- well, you can probably guess who is which, but you must watch it. Full of twists and surprises, with unexpected depth at times. The ending is perfect! I saw this movie in the theater years ago, forgot its title, but finally tracked it down. I could not locate it at any of the rental places, and it's not yet in DVD, unfortunately."
3,JOLIET,"IT SOUNDS LIKE MAN CAN FLOW QUICK BUT, NEVER AS QUICK AS TWISTA. THE ALBUM NEEDS A VARIATION AF BETTER BEATS. IT'S OVERLY WEST COAST AND HIS LYRICS ARE A TAD BIT POINTLESS. WITH THE RIGHT PRODUCER HE COULD GO TOO THAT NEXT LEVEL IN THE GAME."
3,alright album needs better production,"if tha album had better production and maybe a different producer rather than ""way deep"" i would have given this album a better rating. this album is tha type of album u need to listen to more than once to get used to,but i do recomend this album to people who listen to bay area rap,but if u don't then grab somethin' like ""hollow tip"",""brotha lynch"",etc."
4,Unique and informative,"I really enjoyed this book. It provides detailed instructions for many spreads that I have never even heard of, as well as many I have. I do have to admit though, that a few of the spreads I tried, didn't seem to really ""work"" well. But then again, not always does one spread suit two different readings or individuals. I think that overall, this book offers more useful spreads than I have ever seen placed into one book as well as using very unique and lovely decks for the pictorials."
1,It contains satanist imagery,"The reason I rated this book so low is because it has an inverted pentagram with the half man half goat printed on a page. Images like that are very dangerous to your household. I am just going to throw it out because the likelihood that I will ever pick the book up to use it again is unlikely. Had I know such imagery was in the book, I never would have purchased it."
5,"Before you experience it in IMAX, experience the MUSIC!","I purhcased this soundtrack at least 2 weeks ago, and haven't stopped listening to it since. Almost every Disney CD I buy I listen to every single track, and that is what I have done. Although I've set aside about 20 times a day to listen to Shostakovich's Piano Concerto no. 2, set to the story of The Steadfast Tin Soldier, which is my most anticipated segment to see. The Gershwin Piece is excellent, as well as Pomp and Circumstance. As soon as I heard the processional march, I laughed and remembered my high school graduation. Of course, we have Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice, from the original recording of Leopold Stokawski, who can forget the original music? This CD is a mixture of many beautiful themes, and I'm sure it will inspire art students (like me, an animator-to-be) and music lovers alike!"
5,visionary music,"I was fortunate enough to preview the movie before its world premiere (at an educator's preview in Col., Oh--the only one in the world!). The animators were truly able to create stories that matched the excellence of both the music and the musical performances. I recommend this soundtrack to all music lovers. ""The Pines of Rome"" gives me the chills with each listen. Buy the soundtrack and then rush to see the film at an IMAX theatre near you."
5,Sheer Genius,"This CD was one of my best Christmas gifts. I loved ""Fantasia,"" and this was a marvelous sequel. It is difficult to commit to a favorite piece because all are so incredibly excellent. Then I recently feasted upon ""Fantasia 2000"" at the IMAX and had to share my ecstatic experience. It was both a visual and auditory feast. After seeing 2000, listening to the CD will present the amazing images again in your mind's eyes."
5,One song along would make this worth buying,"In my opinion, this CD is worth it just for ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" but there are seven other great tracks, as well. Music like this spans generations; it's essentially timeless in its beauty and ability to put a smile on your face. Great stuff. Yes, there may only be eight tracks on this disc, but four of them are nine minutes or longer, so you're not being cheated out of anything. I'm not a steadfast Disney fan, but they really know how to pick classical music for their masterpiece."
4,Fantasia 2000,"Finnaly finding this CD was a real treat, unfortunately many of the songs were cut down and were not the original Length. Some were even shorter than the movie cuts. While this is a good CD, if you're looking for the full versions of the classics, this is not it."
4,Does Soldier's Medal Deserve A Medal?,"Soldier's Medal (SM) is one of the early books in a long running series about a Special Forces A-Team in Vietnam. I tells the story of a member of the Green Berets who survives many horrific battles and slowly starts to believe he is invincible. Under valued by the Top Brass he decides to take the war into his own hands and leaves the restrictive practices imposed by the American Army behind.An enjoyable read, and not as far fetched as you may think. Don't read this until you have read the preceeding Vietnam Ground Zero books."
3,nice but not worth the high price.,"The slot machine bank was a nice conversation piece at my casino night party, but not worth $70. It should be priced closer to $30."
4,Hard-to-find miniature hospital,"I use this miniature hospital for sandplay therapy. It is not super well-built, so I wouldn't really recommend it as a toy, but more as a miniature.The service and shipping were prompt and courteous."
3,I like the restaurant section,I swam through the pages while relaxing by the hotel pool. I always like the restaurant reviews and we went to quite a few nice places. For Fodor readers you can expect the same ol same ol. They don't go off the deep end and are rather conservative with their outings. Sampling the restaurants and keeping the listings current is their strong suit.
3,"Adequate, but better guides available","We just got back from a trip to Oahu and the Big Island. This book is satisfactory for persons not doing many activites, but the guidebooks ""Oahu Revealed"" and ""The Big Island Revealed"" hada great deal more information about snorkeling, ocean kayaking, beach conditions by season for boarding, etc. The pictures in the ""Revealed"" series really helps you get a feel for the places you may want to visit. I would recomend Fodors for a person who is not leaving a megaresort or staying only in Waikiki, but the other books have much more helpful info about activities and parks.Also, the maps in Oahu revealed are the best I've found. Period. Lots of em, well cross referenced, good color schemes, and easy to read."
1,Hard to setup,"Arrive yesterday. I have 3 computer and all them won't recognize the printer. No 1-800 support, mean I have to pay an additional (for long distance) to get this printer setup. Up to now I still can't get into the help support as it's saturday (tech support is only available M-f 8am-5pm)."
3,Ok Book,"Ummm, I didn't really like this book too much. It's card tricks were just, well, to put it straight to you, weird. I'm not really sure how a card trick qualifies as ""weird,"" but the ones in this book do...like throwing Threes in the air so that as they spin while falling, they look like aces (part of a trick). Some of the beginner tricks are WAY to easy to figure out, and some of the advanced tricks just are too complicated with not enough effect. You'd be better off with Hugard's and Braue's stuff. This book just doesn't cut it for me...and it also doesn't have many illustrations either (barely any). So, if you like ""weird"" card tricks, then go for this. But I wouldn't strongly recommend it...however, it is I guess a good reference book for any magician's library."
5,THE BEST,"REALLY ROSIE is something that I bought for my son, when it first appeared on television. Now, I have bought this marvelous piece of work, sung by the fantastic voice of Carole King, for his son. The songs have become part of our family, from ""Chicken Soup"", to ""Really Rosie"" to ""One Was Johnny"". We love them all,as we watch the fantastic characters,singing along with them. This is just wonderful for children. There aren't many things finer than this production. It is a classic. Carole King was the perfect voice that was chosen for this role. REALLY ROSIE really should be done on Broadway. First it was television for us,then we bought the record,and now the video. We love it."
3,Pretty good,"The cast was great and the story is a classic. I had little understanding of the story of ""Don Juan"" other than that it is a classic, so I wanted to watch it. On a note for the ""family movie seeker"" types, while there is nothing explicit in this movie, I wouldn't recommend the underlying principles of the movie as exceedingly ""moral"". It does make an attempt to show the emptiness of being a ""player"" when compared with true love, however, at the end, he goes right back to being a player."
4,"Grand, goofy Cinemascope blockbuster","""Adventures of Don Juan""(Warner Brothers, 1948)-------------------------------------A grand, plummy adventure/romance starring Errol Flynn as legendary lover Don Juan, a dashing, cavalier lothario (and expert swordsman) who reluctantly gets drawn into politics and saves the Queen of Spain from a royal minister who is a real super-meanie. Lots of swashbuckling and smooching with big, flashy sets and elaborate costumes. Good, corny, old-school Hollywood fun! (Axton)"
3,"Eric ""the Red"" on the movie Adventures of Don Juan","I enjoyed watching Errol Flynn rollicking around the set in the 1949 costume drama Adventures of Don Juan. This movie shows the power of a pretty face to inspire a disgraced Don Juan to help a damsel in distress. A fun movie to watch. Eric ""the Red"""
3,Great Stats- poor print,The book is loaded with good baseball history and a great accumulation of stats but the print is so small that you will need a magnifying glass to read it. So much information is included that it would take at least two volumes to print it with type size we would feel comfortable with.
5,"Health, happiness and holiness","Smith covers a broad range of ideas for becomingless stressed over all.I really appreciated the variety of different stress relieversthat she suggests, including many that don't necessarily requirethe added stress of having to rearrange schedules to put them into practice.Most importantly, she constantly interweaves the importance ofrelating to God as the most important facet of reducing stress.Highly recommended."
2,"As With His Dictionary, Krippes Work Is Insufficient","I feel much the same about this grammar as I do about his dictionary (ISBN: 1881265021; also reviewed). I used it during my first month of study and haven't referenced it since. The title is misleading: it is not really a grammar, it is really just an expanded affix list. A good start, but of little value for extended use. A comprehensive, English-language grammar reference book of the Kazakh langauge is really what is needed. Any takers?Again, as with the dictionary, 2 1/2 stars would be my rating."
2,The Good Shall Triumph,"My first introduction to Ana Seymour's work was disappointing. There were phrases used that were modern...they did not exist 1000 years ago and I was surprised the editor did not catch them. Many things I could not see as happening in this time period. If you were a student of Medieval or English history, you were very disappointed in the story line. The author made up for it in the sequel, Lady of Lyonsbridge, that was much better written. I would skip this novel and move on to that one instead!"
5,Painting Watercolor Portraits That Glow,Painting Watercolor Portraits that Glow is an excellent instuctional book. The instructions were clear and easy to understand. I have never painted a portrait before and was able to complete 5 very satisfying products.
2,"Okay, but not worth $65 plus","I've seen copies of this book priced at over $100. Before you spend that kind of money, be aware that:What I consider the most valuable advice in this book on portraits is repeated in Painting Beautiful Watercolors from Photographs, also buy Jan Kunz, and available at a much more reasonable price.Roberta Carter Clark's How to Paint Living Portraits, which covers oil and watercolor, and charcoal, is a better book over all. Two examples are, how to paint hair, and a much clearer presentation of value in painting. Clark's book even has a better index.I'm not saying Painting Watercolor Portraits that Glow isn't worth looking at, but borrow it from the library, and make sure before you shell out $100 to buy one."
5,awesome,"So funny! My sister loved it. It arrived promptly, undamaged and discreetly packaged. (A plus, since it was a gift.)"
3,"Ok, but not the greatest","Works ok, but after ~6mo of minor use, has started to loose solid contact w/glass leading to streaking.Have also had Bosch blades on another car for some period of time and they are still working great."
1,???,"I saw a preview of this instructor's Wushu on Youtube. And it baffles me that he can claim to teach Wushu, when he doesn't even have a grasp of the basics himself! And then on top of that, teach an entire form? NO!!!Do NOT BUY THIS!!And Suprah? I've been involved in Wushu for at least 8 years now, and I have NEVER heard of this."
4,"Fun, but lacking","Many of the Terminator's lines are not in Arnold's voice, which is very cheesey, he has a voice that just can't be duplicated. Also, many missions are tedious, rather than challenging, and you have to try dozens of times to beat some levels. Still, it is an interesting, alternative take on the movie. Some levels are very fun, like the ones in the future, where you get to shoot machines with plasma rifles."
3,Waaaaaaaaaaaay too HARD!!!!,"Let me start with the good things about this game. First of all, this game has amazing graphics. It also has an amazing story, and awesome gameplay. What more could someone ask for in a game? How about a little easier game? This game is the most frustrating game I've played. I mean seriously, I don't think the people who made this game heard of checkpoints!!!! When I'm playing a level, I'll get to the very end and then I'll die and start the whole dumb level over again. The only way you could ever beat this game is with cheats. Overall, a pretty descent game. It could've been a little easier though."
1,Too hard!!,"I thought this game sucked. I'm pretty good at video games, but this game just seemed to be too hard. I played the first level about ten times and kept dying, then I'd have to start the level all over again. I couldn't kill the spaceship no mater how many times I hit it, so I just gave up. I put a few hours in on this game and that's all the time I'm willing to give it. There are too many other good games to deal with this."
2,You won't be back,"This game is very hard, and not in a fun challenging way, just retardedly hard with nothing to do really but follow a T-X and shoot her 12 levels in a row (with her obviously not getting hurt at all) the worst part is the whole ""no checkpoints"" and can't save till end of level, so if you are like 1 feet away from finishing the level but then die, you start all over again. As most said before, best if you just borrow, or skip this game all together."
5,Very Excellent Book.,"I read this book because I took a class about earthquakes taught by the auther Dr. David Brumbaugh. He is not only an awesome teacher, but he knows his stuff. The book is very detailed without getting too difficult to understand. The book talks not only about the physics of an earthquake , but also the history and culteral myths sourounding earthquakes. The book is a great book to buy if you want have a great understanding about earthquakes. The author teaches at Northern University Arizona, so if you are there TAKE THE CLASS AND BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,It's Ok,"I got the chance to watch this movie, and I think it is an Ok movie. It has a little of suspense, but at the end you kind of know what is going to happen.*Sponsored post"
4,Stick with it...,"Initially I put this book down half-way through. I was getting tired of both its epistolary nature (half the book is letters) and the terribly arch humor. But after picking it up again I was greatly satisfied with the ending. What Caudwell does better than most mystery writers is the surprise ending. If, like me, you feel that that's what mysteries are all about (I love not having a clue whodunit), you'll love Caudwell's books. (By the way, I too think that Hilary Tamar is a man.)"
3,Love and death and law and Greece,"Great cocktail of the ever-fascinating Greece, pedantic legal eagles and wit."
2,A crashing disappointment.,"Unfortunately, I found this mystery very boring, and I usuallylove British mysteries! Its characters were two-dimensional anduninvolving, and the mystery itself wasn't at all engaging. In fact,the resolution reminds me of a classic by recently deceased author, which I better not mention in case I might spoil it for those inclined to read Caudwell's book.One of the problems with this mystery is the series of letters from the young barrister, who behaves pretty idiotically throughout, and so engendered no sympathy or empathy from me. I find that the letters distance the reader from the crime itself, and lessen any suspense that might have been there to begin with.As for the writing style and dialog, I found it pretentious and almost Victorian in tone, which doesn't match very well with the modern setting. As for the wittiness...I just didn't get it! Who knows, maybe I don't have the requisite appreciation for this type of extremely dry wit, if that's what it is."
1,"A Teddibly, Teddibly Refaned Murder","If emotional involvement in a story is important to you, avoid this book at all costs. Most of the story consists of people discussing letters received from a colleague in Venice who is accused of murdering a young man on her package holiday. The effect is one of eavesdropping on a table of people who are terribly, terribly pleased with themselves, and who are for some reason confident of their own wittiness. The book is detached, icy, passive, and infuriating.The mystery itself is ludicrous, one of those plots which could never occur in real life. Fortunately, if you make it to the end, as I did, you won't care enough about any of the characters to be upset. Instead, you'll probably be angry at yourself for wasting time on this smug, self-consciously witty, piece of tripe."
2,Not a Strong closer,It says good up to an 85lb door. My door weighs 10-15lbs less than that yet this closer was not able to close the door. Even after many adjustments. Ended up purchasing one from home depot.
3,Leonard Cohen poetry-yes; music? so-so,"If you want classic Leonard Cohen poetry, this is it. If you want music with it, try his VARIOUS POSITIONS album."
1,worst CD I ever heard,"I listened to this CD in disbelief. Monotonous, dead-tired, low-frequency rasp that does not follow a melody. Might as well, since the accompanying music is annoying synthesizer twang and drum machine clang reminiscent of a seventies adult movie."
1,ten new songs,"I was extreamly annoyed and upset when i got my CD's and the Ten New Songs , would not play and when i looked up were to send it back for replacement i foundd out Amazon will not tale bacl any CD's that have been opened .. how can i know that it wont play with out opening it and trying to hear the music . i will not be buying any more CD's from Amazon . the book service is fine if expencif but dont try the CD""smeg"
3,More a collaboration than a creation,"The strengths and weaknesses of this album share many characteristics with Cohen's Death of a Lady's Man album. In both cases, Cohen's artistry is filtered through a collaboration with another. I must say that the collaboration with Sharon Robinson is more listenable than his earlier collaboration with Phil Specter. But in the end it's kind of like adding milk to hot tea: mellower in flavor but I, for one, miss the bite of the undiluted original."
2,fun experiment,"Did you ever wonder what it would sound like if you took the great voice and lyrics of Leonard Cohen, hired a karaoke band to play the music, then time-traveled back to the early 80s to produce it? Well, wonder no more!!!"
2,I LOVE Leonard Cohen but. . .,"Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam. I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little. But. . .I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great. I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho."
3,He still has it!,"I would have liked to hear a few more upbeat songs on this album,but all in all I liked it."
3,A TRUE LEGEND,Leonard Cohen is a legend beyond any critic.A real poet i believe more than a mucisian.In all his works he offers more and more fresh air from a real thinking man who experiences life in his own unique way and has the ability to sing it.It is a cd that you have to buy if you respect your collection.
1,The Romantic seed,"The man with the Romantic seed decided that he would release some more music, unoriginally titled Ten New Songs (buy hey look at his other titles as well). First thing that struck me was how backward looking, how dated, almost, this sounds - along the same lines as I'm Your Man - mainly because of the 80s style electronic drums. Of course Cohen's music has mainly been about old style singing and once again the master of the low does not disappoint. Ten New Songs is as good a record as he has released bar Love and Hate and Songs Of, the lyrics and mood growing with every listen. His best writing and voice was always likely to be in his early musical career but his style is becoming more and more original as people gradually start to look backward. It's a night record...is there a Zen element?But hey listen to it sinking down - observe and marvel at the way Cohen spent so much time on the words..."
1,Number #10,"Some of the worst songs ever.Its not even worth a one.I listened to it twice ..this is dull, boring and depressing.I have been a fan since 1968.I would not recommend this for new fans . Start with ""I'm Your Man"" then go buy the Suzanne album.He is dialing for dollars on this one and ""Dear Heather"" is more of the same. {Number #10 is what the Vietnamese called the GI's in Vietnamand it means worst.}This guy should be composing anti war songs again instead of number #10.At least something better than this in ""The Future"""
4,Turn out the lights,Listen to the poetry. Listen to the voices. Listen to the background. Until recently I had left Cohen behind. My mistake. It's nice to listen and be rewarded. You will enjoy.
5,At last - thank you Amazon.ca,"Douglas Wolk's opinion aside, (everyone has one), its a joy to have this lost lamb return to its fold (my collection). Leonard is a man who sees life through the common man's eye's. His ability to arrange common English words in an unusual fashion is beyond remarkable. I lost this album through corruption of the original CD some time ago and have just gotten around to replacing it. That's not to say I didn't miss it, I have, very much so. In my opinion, this terrific album ranks among his very best. Maybe Douglas Wolk should retire to a monestary and spend some time contemplating his objectivity when reviewing artists works.Bravo Leonard! Merci! Merci! Merci!"
4,"Maybe not his best ever, but still something you need to own","The old curmudgeon is mellowing, but he has not lost his edge. These songs are stripped down and elegant. Not as raw as The Future or as nicely orchestrated as the Live CD, but omg, who else sings with such soul? or writes lyrics with such intelligence? Any serious Cohen fan gotta own this. Anyone who is not a serious Cohen fan is missing something. Buy this one just for the beautiful vocal duet on Alexandra Leaving. The whole album will grow on you in a slow, insidious way, like the depression following a bad drunk."
3,great vocals and poetry but below average instrumentations,"Somehow, the ambience of this recording is missing part of the magic. That part of the magic is the backdrop or background if you will that gives colorful contrast to Cohen's voice. In this recording that background is shallow and lacking color(s).Cohen's voice would have been better complemented with a live acoustic band and it would have made his latest effort a golden peg in musical history. I cannot imagine the Beatles or Shirley Horne singing along with a synthetic band.Now I have to wait another 8 to 10 years to see if Mr. Cohen will learn from this. I only hope his voice will still be strong then."
3,...,"Love Leonard Cohen. Love his words, love his voice on this CD. Hate the backup singer. She was everywhere, on every song. Bless her heart, she certainly sang her heart out, but really. If I wanted to hear her, I would have bothered to learn her name."
5,Chilling... absolutely chilling and essential,"I have ""Alexandra Leaving"" (track 7) on virtual repeat... can't stop going back to it over and over again. This record is a chilling masterpiece. Though I would like to hear a version with a full band behind it (as opposed to this demo-ish synth backing), the synths work well in their own idiosyncratic way, augmenting Mr. Cohen's unique vision. Whatever. This record is the sound of sublime, absolute heartbreak, and you wouldn't want it any other way."
5,maybe one of his best production,"This album might be one of the best of Cohen's production, even though it is very difficult to choose from so many masterpieces. I own this CD and every time I listen to it I like it more, the unusual combination of music and lyrics is perfect and makes you feel out of this world for a while. My advice is to listen to Leonard's songs with somebody you love, if not, it could be dangerous to your health. All the songs are great but maybe the heart of the album is ""You have loved enough""."
1,Oh dear.,"I bought this album when it was first released, tried to listen to it once, groaned in disbelief and went back to the old stuff. I gave it a second spin today and still couldn't last out to the end. Compared with the earlier albums that could be beautiful, haunting, exciting, humerous and subversive, all at the same time, this one is just dreary to the power of ten, little more than a spoken-word recording of some new poems to a dreadful muzak background. I would have liked to listen to the poetry, as other reviewers have clearly managed to, but the whole thing just sounded so awful. How can a man who gave us Leaving Green Sleeves, Chelsea Hotel, Sisters of Mercy, Marianne and so many other wonderful - and wonderful-sounding - songs put his name to this dross?"
3,A Lackluster Performance,"This CD is about on par with Dear Heather, except it is more somber and dirge-like. It could use at least one song with an upbeat tempo, and the heavy use of synthetic sound gives it a sterile feeling. I long to hear a new Cohen CD where his guitar is the central instrument again and there is actually a live band backing him up. The songs worth repeat listening are: ""A Thousand Kisses Deep,"" ""In My Secret Life,"" ""Alexandra Leaving,"" and ""The Land of Plenty."" The lyrics, in typically Cohen fashion, are pretty good for songs, but not quite poetry, however the music is just slow, depressing and dark, like a clock winding down."
2,not a cohen album,Dont get fooled this is not the real leonard.This is not his album neither.The major part belongs to mrs Sharon Robinson his back up singer for many years and i dont know why he is putting his signature to her songs.Here cohen sounds very light and meaningless.
1,I could just cry.,"After waiting all these years, Leonard finally came down from the mountain to deliver this mouse. Most of the song lyrics are just ""Westernized"" Zen cliches. You want to know the sound of one hand clapping---listen to this CD and you'll find out. Boring!!!!The only song that shows his wry sense of humor is ""That Don't Make It Junk.""Also, Leonard, spring for a real studio next time with real musicians. Trading hard-drives with Sharon (Oh, Sharon, beautiful Sharon...What Happened???!!!) just didn't pan out.And please, Leonard, next time pick up the tempo."
5,Never too old for another masterpiece,"Thanks to Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson for the best CD of 2001. I'm a fan and this is a classic. Not a below-average song in the lot, and some incredible gems which somehow are especially relevant post-9/11 because of the themes, lyrics and the musical mood. ""May the lights in the Land of Plenty shine on the truth some day."""
3,Cyber City,"Obviously, Leonard Cohen is not primarily a musician, but since this is a recording, the music counts, and there's no getting around that. Many of the lyrics here are among the best Cohen has ever composed (I'm especially thinking of ""Alexandra Leaving"", ""Love Itself"", and ""Boogie Street""). Sharon Robinson is a very good singer, and helps Cohen's own failing voice (never much to begin with) enormously. Robinson's arrangements are not bad, either, but they need to be played by musicians, not realized by robots (MIDI sequencers).This is not Cohen's first album of robot music--""I'm Your Man"" and ""The Future"" also suffered from a dearth of actual musicians, but it is his most consistently robotic, and I'm forced to deduct two stars for that. Sorry, Leonard.(If you want to hear what top-notch musicians can do for Cohen, listen to the brilliant ""Recent Songs"".)"
2,Too Expensive,"This is a fine movie, but greatly overpriced for a final product on DVD. To be honest, when I looked at the playing side of the disc, I thought I had purchased a bootleg, a pirated copy of the original DVD release. Judging from the comments of other purchasers, however, I see that that isn't the case. If you must have this DVD, I recommend purchasing it from one of the dealers on Amazon who will sell it to you for less. Considering the poor picture quality and lack of extras, the disc is really worth around $10 or less, as far as I'm concerned."
5,Billy Budd,"This is a classic film about a classic book. The cast is just right, even the odd choice of Robert Ryan as the Master at Arms, and after almost wearing out the tape of my VHS version I was delighted that it is now available on DVD. Peter Ustinov is the driving force behind this production and it is clear that this is a labor of love. Highly recommended"
5,Excellent movie,"I saw this movie as a young girl with my family at the drive in theater years ago. This movie really affected me then. I just watched the film again after all these years, still affects me. Great movie. Excellent acting by the young Terrance Stamp. He played the sweet role quite well. Did great in the ""Collectors"" too as I recall - what great range as an actor. Highly recommend."
5,welcome to the real world,"I first saw this movie at about 10yrs old,I was use to seeing happy storybook endings! And right up till they hanged Billy Budd, I thought that at the last second Billy Budd would not hang. I was shocked that he hung,and could not understand why he was hanged,to this day,it scared me."
5,"Good movie, if you can find it","This is a movie about duty. With excellent performances by all it illustrates the great trap of power, the fact that you have to do your job no matter what. This can be seen in the character of Captain Veer. He doesn't want to do what he has to do with Billy Budd, he knows it is the right thing to do. Can he bring himself to complete his job even though he doesn't want to do it? Can he bring himself to carry out justice even though Billy was provoked and was totally justified in his crime? This is type of movie that will make you think about basic facts of human nature.My impression good movie that sticks to the book"
5,Naval drama of the highest order,"I first saw this many years ago...a truly excellent and thought-provoking film.When Billy Budd accidentally kills a sadistic officer on-board ship, the captain is forced to lay charges under wartime Naval law. In the process he unleashes larger issues about good and evil, and condemning a good man using ""just the facts"". If you liked the courtroom scene in The Caine Mutiny, you will find this fascinating.March 9, 2007: Wouldn't you know it! I had this DVD pre-ordered and tracked its progress hourly by the USPS website to my front door. But when I arrived home it was nowhere to be found...someone made off with it(!) I have never had any mail stolen before...luckily a replacement is on the way (perhaps the thief will watch it, see themselves in Claggart and amend their ways....)"
1,This DVD is garbage,"Don't get me wrong the movie itself is great .I have a 1985 Key Video VHS copy of the movie that I wanted to update with a DVD.The DVD says digitally mastered ,I guess that means it looks worse than a 21 year old used rental VHS tape .I don't see how they can charge $26 for this junk .I am going to try and get my money back."
3,"Harmless, silly fun.","We had resisted buying this due to the gross-out factor, but let our daughter use her allowance money for it. It's been a few weeks and the kids (aged 5 & 8) are still playing with it, although they do occasionally need help getting the brain in, or replacing the nose door.For an adult, the repetitive nature of Louie's narrative (and achoo-ing) can be fairly annoying. But there is an off switch to play the game without sound.The, umm, boogers are a little sticky and do tend to pick up dust, cat hairs and the like, but can be easily rinsed off."
4,Good concept but...,"I thought the concept was good and my kids think it's fun and hilarous, but I thought the durability and easiness to handle need work. My son (age 7) could not play this game by himself with a friend without my assistance every game (which by the way only lasts a minute or so). It's not easy to stuff the gooey's back in to play again and be able to close up the head. The gooey's have to be stuffed in just right or the head won't close. My 2 1/2 year old thinks it is hilarious and wants to play all the time."
2,Waste of money,"I bought this game for a 4 1/2 year old. It was cute the first few times but he and his 10 year old cousin played with and got bored with it after about 15 minutes. It is annoying with a constant ""ah ah ah ah"" sound and it only says 3 sayings over and over. I might have not been so dissapointed if this game was more like $5, but at $18 I felt like I had wasted my money."
3,Silly fun,"I actually purchased this for some adult friends of mine because I thought it looked pretty funny. It gets repetitive of course, but is a fun time for everyone who tries it for the first few times. The sound effects, the consistency of the worms, the consistency of the brain, etc. are all pretty funny. Again, overall I'd say it was worth it since it was less than $10, but not the focus of the party or anything, just a bunch of silly fun that is worth the money."
4,Good Advice,"I purchased the book because I was intrigued to see what kind of advice the father and daugther would give to someone in a similar situation. Their advice not only makes sense for someone in a severe conflict with their parent/child but is good advice in general for not only parenting but for many other relationships in life. The book was not difficult reading and was nicely laid out with advice to fathers, advice to daughters, and advice for moms. The only complaint I had with the book was that there were some layout mistakes in the text. In at least one place the end of a sentence was missing as though the layout person didn't open the text box far enough to allow all the sentence to print. There were missing words and duplicate words but it wasn't often enough to discourage me from reading and enjoying the book. I recommend the book to all parents, not just those going through difficulty with their children."
4,Hard to find in stores pellets hit hard.,Hard to get heavier pellets locally. These have improved punch on small game.These pellets are very uniform and result in tight groups at my hunting ranges.
5,Target slayer,"The whistle sounds.Charging to the split rail fence, I kneel and pop off two rounds. Dead middle.Jumping to my feet, I race to the mounds some 15 yards from the set of bottles. One shatters, then the next, and finally the third explodes in a shower of shards. Precious seconds tick off the clock.Around the burned out hulk to a prone position near a cluster of bushes. 'PING', the pellet bounces off the target. Again, and again.Finally, the horn erupts. ""TIME,"" calls the referee.Pacing back through the course, I can see where each of the Crosman Premier Ultra Magnum's left their mark. Paper targets, bottles, and even plinking targets were no match for the .177 cal pellets. Ease of loading and superior consistency among the pellets make these the best for backyard plinking and even small rodent control. You will be extremely happy with your purchase from Crosman."
5,Great,These pellets shoot great in my gammo whisper deluxe. They came packed nicely and are very heavy compared to normal pellets.
3,One yellow-eyed man against the universe,"My, my, what a cocky hero we've got here. For years he has lived in frozen Pennsylvania, to be picked up by aliens who rule the earth. Though our hero hasn't seen much of the world and has lived like a caveman for years, he manages to keep out of the hands of the real rulers, who are after a secret, hidden in the DNA of his yellow eyes. It is thanks to his anti-social behaviour and his rude manners that he manages to shake them off all the time. Our unsympathic hero gets help everywhere, but never a moment of gratitude, which seems to be his survival.I didn't find this novel half as entertaining as the other reviewer, but I've read worse."
4,"Ice ages, supernovas, genetic engineering, galactic empires.","In the 1990s, the Earth plunges into an Ice Age. Aliens come to rescue us, but really come to search for a person with golden eyes whose chromosomes contain the secret of how to blow up a star, encoded into his genes by a genetic engineer 35,000 years ago... A zillion wild ideas thrown at you machine gun style...a wild ride for a sci-fi-fan!"
2,Mildly-entertaining pot-boiler. 2.3 stars,"___________________________________________The Earth has entered a new Ice Age, destroying temperate-zone civilization. Then, ships from the Galactic Empire arrive to help! But they're crewed by dim adolescent dorks, and other things don't add up...Has moments, but basically a pot-boiler. Well, bills must be paid...Author's comment: ""I thought it would be fun to write a pot-boiler; oddly, it wasn't. Anyway, I was only twenty-seven when I wrote it; you can't expect too much. ""Happy reading--Pete Tillman"
5,Old-fashioned folk tale with lush colors and great lesson,"As a storyteller for children libraries and schools I found this book to be beautifully illustrated and a great source for speaking of responsibility to children, in an entertaining manner. It is also a good source for teaching children about other cultures and customs. Many cultures have their own versions of ""Cinderella"" and comparing them could be a form of discussion with the children after telling this tale."
3,book,nice version of the americanized version of cinderella. used it in a classroom and students really enjoed. highly recommend for kids
2,Would like to see the real version,"I have a working copy of this book that was given to me while taking the product design course at the University of Texas. The book would probably be a lot better if it had a good index, but since it was thrown together to give the class something to read, it doesn't. I didn't use the book much for class, but have used it some since then. This book uses design tools that are good in theory, but sometimes take too long to actually be used in a real situation (i.e. QFD)."
4,Fun game for all ages,"A classic I played as a kid, glad to see it made again! Has been fun to play again.A game where you try to complete the pipe with a certain number of cards, but sometimes you are given a leak by another player that you have to fix before you can go on.Great fun!"
3,makes creaky noises,"I bought this chair so that both my three year old and my infant could use it. It has been useful so far. The only complaint that I have is that when my three month old moves around in it, it makes creaky noises. It sometimes makes her wake up if she moves around in her sleep. I agree that it could use more padding to make the seat more comfortable for both baby and toddler."
3,good for second child,"we chose this seat for our second child, having seen toddlers damage their infant sibling's seats and toys by trying to sit in them, too. Because this accomodates a child up to 40 lbs, it saved me a bit of stress, and also made one less item only the baby was priveleged enough to use. I had a problem with the pointed ""feet"" in front (see add photo) when the seat is used as a rocker: because I used it to keep the baby close at hand in kitchen or living room, I frequently turned and hit my feet on them, adding more scrapes and bruises than I needed."
2,Not a great entertainer,"This bouncer never kept my little girls attention from day one. Now she is nearly 5 months old and still not excited about this bouncer. I like the fact that this bouncer grows with your baby. And the fact that the toys are removable, but my daughter will only sit in the bouncer for maybe 5 minutes. If your baby enjoys moving toys and music do not buy this bouncer. It will not hold their attention."
2,Foldout Kickstand,I just finished putting this bouncer together (1 week till the baby is due). The cross brace should snap in place. It never did. I had to get a hammer to get it to lock the tabs into place (this so far is the worst thing I have put together including the crib).Besides the assembly issues the foldout kickstand doesn
3,Not one of my favorite baby products,"We got this chair as a shower gift; I personally thought bouncers are boring and didn't even register for one (I registered for a swing instead). And indeed, my daughter was never really happy sitting in it, even the vibrations didn't help. The toys are boring, I ended up hanging a more interesting toy and that occupied her for some time. The only time the chair was useful was when we started feeding her solids and didn't have the high chair. Then she loved it, since she associated sitting in with getting fed :) I would recommend a swing or a more exciting bouncer, with lights and music instead of this. I also don't see this as a kid's rocker - I would rather buy a rocking horse or something similar. I don't think its a bad product, good quality and easy to assemble, just not for those babies that like something that's entertaining."
4,Great..unless you have an active child,"My 8 month old son did not like this seat until he was about 3 months old (too big for a baby, baby in my opinion)....for about two months we could leave him in front a video in the rocker and he loved it....then he became mobile (crawling before 6 months) and we would put him in it to keep him still....and next thing I know he tipped it to the side, got out and was pullin up on the CD stand....at 6 months! I heard it is great once your child will sit in it unstrapped and stay in it!"
3,Could be better,"This is the only real option once your child outgrows a bouncer, but it's merely adequate for that ""in between"" stage. I like the pattern and the recline, but it could definately use more padding. Also, the toys pull right off with the slightest tug and the ball is very hard. I do like that we will be able to use this seat as our son grows older as well."
4,Wonderful Economic Bouncer,"This is a great bouncer for the amount you pay for it. My son has been using his bouncer since he was 3 weeks old. At first, he only would stare at the high contrast arch. As he got older and began developing better motor skills, he started batting at the hanging toys. He's now 4 months old and no longer needs the arch. He prefers them latched onto the chair itself so he can grab them and put them in his mouth. His favorite is the square and triangle toy because he's teething. It could be improved with some interactive sounds other than just the monkey playing music, but still 4 stars because of its ability to change into a rocker (my son loves to rock himself, so another big plus) and hold up to a toddler. As for it flipping over, I would assume a 1-year-old would no longer need to be strapped in the first place so he can catch himself in the case that he might rock himself too hard."
3,Wish I bought a traditional bouncy seat,"Infants are too small to make this seat rock, and it doesn't bounce when they kick their feet like a traditional bouncy would. I knew it wouldn't bounce, but I figured it would rock, or if nothing else, the vibrations would keep my son happy, but I was wrong. He was not happy in it with the vibrations on or off.Also, the toys hanging from the bar are too far for a baby to reach. My son would get so bored sitting in this motionless seat, unable to grab the toys.Maybe it will be okay when he is a toddler, but I found it pretty useless for an infant.My friend gave me an inexpensive, used bouncy seat, and my baby is much happier in it."
3,NOT for BABIES,"I bought this rocker for my 4 month old who kicks and loves to exercise. He outgrew the ocean wonders aquarium bouncer that I could not live without. He loved it and slept in it. He got too long for it so I bought this one since it does not bend back like a bouncer. The bottom is too hard and when my baby kicks, he hurts the back of his foot. Also, the fact that it rocks is VERY dangerous for a baby who can not catch themself. My 2 year old daughter likes it and reclines in it to watch tv. I do not recommend this product for a baby, but great for a toddler."
1,Beware of tip overs,Please DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. We purchased this for our son who is now 9 months old. He has managed to tip it over face first onto our floor by leaning over to try to grab a toy. It is very dangerous. I have also filed a complaint with the manufacturer.
1,Just okay.,"I was just okay with this. It seems a bit big for the baby, and he wasn't that enthused with it. He's gotten used to it, but I think it's b/c I keep trying to put him in it. Also, when other kids are there, they want to rock it and it goes fast. I would rather have a bouncy type of seat."
1,Great for Toddlers NOT Infants,"I got this item thinking I would save money over time as it was designed to grow with my 2nd child. It is sturdy as a bouncer, but very hard and not comfortable for her to stay in for very long. Since it is sized to fit a toddler as well, it was not at all snug enough for an infant's taste. As a toddler rocker it works, but slides out from under him when he gets in or out and has caused some pretty good bumps. At this point my two-year-old is scared of it and my infant now has a more comfortable basic bouncer. The only thing I got out of this purchase was the materials of fabric I stripped off to make a cute little bag for baby pool toys!! If that's what you could use it for, then by all means go and get it. Otherwise, just stick with the more basic models."
1,Dangerous- Tips Sideways Too!!!,"I too THOUGHT this was a great seat that could be used through the toddler years. I changed my mind when my 7 month old tipped the chair over, (and herself) sideways, trying to reach a toy she had dropped. Fisher Price should rethink the design and stop calling it an ""Infant to Toddler Rocker,"" if it's only meant for toddlers who sit up and down on their own. Don't buy this product unless you want to be on a first name basis at the ER."
4,Very impressed,"Our baby was a preemie. He weighed 5 pounds 2 ounces when we brought him home. We put him in it immediately and he loved it. The vibraitons soothed him. I like that the toy bar can be removed. This has been a lifesaver, I can take him anywhere in the house in it and he is happy. My only suggestion for improvement is having more than one speed for the vibration."
1,Dangerous,"I got the first version of this chair for my 5 year old and i loved it so i got it for my new baby and is nothing like the first one is made cheaper and it flip forward, my daughter was playing one day and she drop a toy and when she went to pick it up the chair flip and she hurt her faces, I think that is very dangerous and fisher price should take it out of the market and do it like the first one that didn't come with toys but it was a lot more secure this one comes with toys but is made cheaper. If you are thinking about getting it think twize before you do it."
1,DANGEROUS,"This seat is dangerous. My 9 month old reached forward to get a toy and flipped over onto our tile floor, face first. All I could do was scoop her up because she was strapped in and the seat was on top of her. She got a knot on her head. I called Fisher Price and they want me to send it to them. This needs to be recalled before someone gets seriously injured. This seat is very unsafe. I'm sure my daughter is not the first to flip over in this and will not be the last unless they do something."
1,This chair is unsafe.,When I first bought this chair for my daughter she was about 3 months old. I loved it. She is now 6 1/2 months old and I am scared to leave her in it. She flipped out of the chair and her feet got tangled in the strap that holds them in. I went into the next room to get something and she started screaming. Imagine my horror when I walked into her room and my baby was laying on the floor with her feet caught in the chair. She weighes about 20 pounds and is now pulling herself up to a sitting position and I guess she reached for something and just flipped out. I would use the kick stand but I have a fear if she pushes back to far it will flip backwards. The only thing I can do is never leave her alone in it.Just be careful.
3,will last long but be careful of rocking position,"(...) I noticed as my 5 month old son reached for a toy he fell completly over when in the rocking position. But still liked this seat because my 5 year old can sit in it and watch tv so for this price it is okay, but once baby can sit up, dont put it in the rocking position anymore."
1,WARNING:CHAIR FLIPS,"I thought this was a great chair when I bought it for my 4 month old, but at 8 months old she rocked it all the way back. The chair flipped and she hit her head on the floor. This was NOT AT ALL hard for her to do. I would strongly recommend you NOT purchase this product."
4,Good but be very watchful,This item is great when your child is a newborn. I would put him in there all the time. The recliner and the toys are great however when he started to sit up and grab things that were dropped on the floor I noticed the rocker would almost flip forward. Even when I would use the base to make the rocker a flat chair he would move and flip and the next thing I knew he was almost standing in the rocker and he's not even 10 months. So watch and be very alert. I drag the rocker every where I never leave him unattended.
3,"Good Product, Easy to Pull Toys Off","I received this rocker at my baby shower and I thought I would love it. I've tried it several times over the life of my 6 month old, but it never seemed to entertain him. I put him in it a couple of weeks ago (after about a 2 month hiatus) and he pulled off all the toys in about 2 minutes. They are attached by a velcro strap and it is very easy to pull them off if your little one is strong enough; and eventually they all are. I think he will like it when he is older and can really rock it, but for now he is only entertained until he pulls off the toys. And a couple of minutes really isn't worth putting him in it at this point."
2,Not all that impressed,"I bought this as a 2nd chair, because I got sick of lugging our first bouncy seat up and down stairs. Our baby just isn't nearly as impressed by this chair as she is with the Kick and Play Bouncer seat we also have. I hope she grows to like it as she gets bigger but right now it doesn't get much use."
4,Great until baby learns how to rock him/herself,"I loved this chair for my son. It was wonderful!!! However as soon as he learned how to rock himself back and forth, he rocked himself so hard that he fell forward. Now the only time I can put him in it is with the kickstand out. I really don't like the fact that he has no choice but to stay still now. I would say that this rocker should be until they are about 6 months old."
5,This chair is GREAT!,I bought this chair for my son when he outgrew his baby papisan bouncer at four months. He's now 6 months and loves it more everyday. It's a life saver. I don't have to worry about him leaning forward like I would with the bouncer. This can either rock or I can use the kickstand (I've only done that a few times though). The vibrating is great and the toy bar is even better. I was missing that with the baby papisan and he loves the entertainment. He will watch Baby Einstein forever in this rocker. I can actually wash bottles and get the house clean while he's playing away in this chair! I love it!
2,HAZARDOUS ONCE BABY SITS ON OWN,"I thought that this was an awesome gift...and in the beginning it was. With the kickstand up, it gave my little girl a cozy small environment to lay in and nap.However, when she started sitting on her own was when the problems began. I would put the kickstand back so she could sit up more (all babies love to sit up stick straight at that age). One day, she went to reach forward, and to my horror and shock, the entire seat went forward with her. Fortunately I was right there and put my leg out in front of her and caught her...if I had not been in the room, her face would have slammed into pergo flooring. Fisher Price reps claim that they have never heard of this problem, but from reading other feedback here, I see that many many children have either face planted or almost face planted into the floor. Fisher Price needs to either ammend the instructions and state that the kickstand needs to be used until the feet can touch the ground or just recall this chair entirely."
4,This chair tips!!!!! My baby got hurt in this chair!!!!!!!!,"This chair tips over, with the reclining bar down or up. We had our baby in the chair with the safety reclining bar pulled forward so she could recline. She leaned to the side to look for a toy and the whole chair tipped with her still strapped to it. She landed face first with the chair on top of her. NOT A SAFE PRODUCT!!!!"
5,AWESOME-BEST ITEM WE HAVE OWNED!,"This rocker is great! I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. We got our first rocker before my daughter was born, and are still using it! She loves to sit in it and rock. We purchased another rocker when I was pregnant with my son. He still uses his also. I put both of my children in it from the time they were born. At first, I did have to prop their head up sometimes with a blanket, but that was no big deal. I have never had any trouble with either one of my children tipping the rocker over. And I assume the rocker is very comfortable, because both of my children loved to take naps in it. GREAT ITEM! If I had only had one baby item, this one have been it!"
1,dangerous - tips over with baby in it,"I have an 8 month old baby who loved to sit in the chair and play with toys. He leaned forward to get a toy from the floor and the chair flipped over with him pinned underneath. He ended up with a big bruise and two black eyes. Fisher price offered a refund and ups pick up, BUT explained it is ONLY INTENDED for a child who can not sit up or a child who is big enough to climb in and out without needing the harness. Fisher Price was not surprised by the incident."
4,A great chair for big babies,"My husband and I are both large people. I'm 6'2 and he is 5'11,so naturally our children get big fast. That's why this chair is so great. My son is almost four months and was close to reaching the weight limit of 20lbs on the regular bouncy chair.While on the chair/rocker the limit is 40lbs. That's why I feel that this chair is so wonderful. He's not at the age where he's ready to do alot. So, he still needs his chair to comfort him for periods of time while I do chores. This chair/rocker has the soothing vibrations,colorful toys and I can also rock him while he plays. I also feel once he's able to walk he'll love that he will still have the same chair to rock himself and look at books in."
1,DANGEROUS!!,"I bought this when my daughter was only 3 months old and it was fine. But when she started sitting up at 5 months, she reached forward to grab a toy that was on the floor directly in front of her seat and tipped it forwards. I saw when it was about to happen but by the time I reached her, she had landed on her head still strapped in with the seat on top of her. As you can imagine, I freaked out and now I only put her in with the bottom part out. And even then, I still don't trust it because I know if she stries to stand up, it will tip backwards. I read the reviews of others giving this a 5 star rating and I wonder, WHAT ARE THEY THINKING? So I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. Just be careful!!"
5,Great grow-with-baby product,"When registering for baby stuff, my husband and I decided on this rocker instead of a more traditional bouncer for a number of reasons, the primary one being that it can be used for up to 40 pounds, meaning we would only need one seat for roughly four years. Our daughter has Downs syndrome and will be developmently delayed, how much so is anyone's guess, so it can be used in a reclined position for as long as we need it.Nikki loves the toys and enjoys watching them, and with encouragement reaching for them. The chair was very easy to put together and great to move room to room."
2,Spend your money on a better product,"I thought this would be a really nifty thing to have, but it is BORING! There is stuff that the baby can look at, and it vibrates, but it isn't very interactive. There are other products out there that light up and play music when the baby kicks his feet. This is basically just a rocking chair with some stuffed animals hanging from it. Spend your money on a better product!"
4,My four year old son still loves it!,"He will sit in it for hours and read in his room, we bought it right after he was born and it is still sturdy. It is also very easy to wash...although the fabric has faded quite a bit...it still works GREAT!"
1,DANGEROUS!,"I love these chairs for their usefullness, but when my daughter turned 9mths or 22 pounds the chair became a hazard. My daughter was drinking her bottle and the chair was flexed back she tried scooting up, since she could no longer rock, and then the chair fell back, my child's bottle banged her in the lip causing her to have a bruise not to mention the trauma, thank God I had her strapped. Then I thought well, let's give it another try,but this time only as a rocker, since the other way was so dangerous. This 2nd time was worse. She was rocking back and forth playing with the toys it comes with and all of a sudden, she flew back. I was livid. I called Fischer Price and told them of what transpired. They offered to reimburse me for the product and paid for shipping to return it back to them. Plse be careful, never leave your child unattended with this chair, if you do have it and must use it, put it against a wall so it can not fall back.Concerned Parent."
5,The best Chair,I rec'd this chair at one of my baby showers. I thought about returning it since it was not the chair that I registered for. I am so glad I did not return this chair. My daughter is now 18 months old and she just loves to sit in it and watch Barney or Elmo. We are now looking at getting another one for baby number two. That way my daughter don't have to share since she is still 20 pounds away from the weight limit. This is a great chair and I would recomend it to everyone.
2,Others are definitely better,"At first this chair seemed to be agood idea. Whenever my infant son was fussy we would place him in the chair and turn the vibrating chair on. However, this chair does not rock very well at all and my son never played with the overhanging toys. Reading other reviews of how children are falling face first this chair will not be around long enough for my son to that. There are better chairs out there, even some by Fisher Price. My son really loves the kick and play bouncer. It's more interactive and vibrates also."
5,Can't live without it!,"We had a regular little bouncy seat and when our daughter started leaning from side to side, I was always afraid she would fall out or tip over. So I bought this rocking chair... what a life saver!! She seems very secure in it. She takes naps in it, I've used it as a feeding chair, and she loves the toys (especially the monkey). She doesn't seem to like or dislike the vibrate feature. She is very content to sit in the chair as I do dishes or make dinner. And I love the fact that we can get a few years use out of it, compared to just a few months that most other toys/gear seem to provide."
4,Great So Far,"My son is only 1 month old and this has become a life saver when I'm cooking, cleaning and bathing. If he's in a good mood, he focuses on the black and white animal print bar and enjoys the vibration. I only wish the little monkey played the tune a little longer, but we are quite pleased with this rocker thus far."
4,Great seat - grows with child,We bought the older version of this for our son when he was about 6 months old. He still uses it at 18 months. He has as much fun climbing on and off it as he does sitting and watching his videos in it. He finds the rocker a bit tippy but I imagine he will like it when he's a bit older and has more stability. Great chair.
4,Fun for baby,"Baby wasn't interested in it at first...preferred bouncer. The vibrations aren't near as strong as the bouncer, but once baby got older, she really loved grabbing the toys. Hope she still likes it when she's a toddler.I'm editing this now that she's 18 months, and she loves this chair!!! She loves to sit in it and rock her baby dolls, and she loves it for a TV chair. Great Chair!"
2,Not good for a toddler,I bought this rocker to replace the fisher price kick and play bouncy seat when my daughter out grow it. I used the bouncy seat all the time. Now that she is almost 1 years old this rocker is useless. She will seat in it for maybe 2-3 minutes and then climb out of it. If your baby or toddler is very active like mine this rocker is not worth buying because they learn to climb out of it.
3,Just Okay,"I bought this when my 3 month old was in the hospital. 3 weeks later, we are home and she doesn't want anything to do with it. The toys on the toy bar fall off all the time. There is just a tiny piece of velcro holding them on...which would be okay if the piece were bigger. I did like the rocking...since we had no swing. We had to replace the battery one time, which was easy. The cover comes off easily for washing. My 19 month old has since taken over the rocker and it has become a bit wobbly. I'm not real crazy about the boyish colors, but the 30 bucks was worth it for the hospital stay...but I wouldn't spend it again just for use at home."
4,Great Boucer,DS really loves the boucer. He likes the toys. They can either go overhead or on the chair with velcro. The strips are big enough that I can attach several of his toys to it. He doesn't seem to like the vibration of it. He'll take a nap in it or just sit in it while I do dishes or we eat dinner. It's to large to take places. I throw it in the trunk of my car when one of his Grandmas baby sit.
3,Perfect for new mother learning to multi-task.,We received this as a shower gift. It's a great seat! The rocking is wonderful. The vibration keeps baby happy and the toys keep baby busy. My only complaint would be that the motor stopped working after only 3 months of use. I took it back to Toys R Us w/out receipt or box and they exchanged it right there. I was thrilled to get another chair! I would still suggest buying this chair for your child.
4,"Good, if your kid will sit in it.","My triplets sat in this for the first fwe months. about 7 months they started screaming whenever they were in it. The reason? They were now able to sit up and they wanted to be where they can move and play. Babies this age are meant to be up and playing, not sitting in a chair, thats why most bouncers won't hold them past 20 lbs. Now they they're 2 years old, they'll sit in them again to watch tv and stuff, but they've got other chairs for that too.I'm not a kid. I have to use this form because I have no credit card."
1,Unsafe Product,"I have been using this chair for 1 year and have loved it until today. My 12 month old baby sat forward while buckeled in and tipped the chair over, falling face forward on his head. He suffered an egg size bump on his head. As of today, I would not recommend this product to anyone and will ever never use it again."
2,Be Careful - chair tips over,"I liked this chair until my seven month old baby reached forward to get a toy and the chair flipped over, leaving her face scratched up. The chair is called an ""Infant to Toddler Rocker"", which suggests that it should be safe for all babies, but I think Fisher-Price needs to rethink the design since it's obviously not safe for a child who can reach forward."
2,The hanging toys are boring!,"My daughter received this as a present when she was 3 months old, she now is 8 months old. She never really liked it. She would play in it for a short time but that was it. We put more interesting hanging toys on it and she seemed to like it better. I hope she likes it more when it is just a plain rocker for when she gets older. Buy something else :)"
2,not so good afterall,"We received this chair as a gift in our baby shower. I moved out of the US when my baby had three weeks, and we finally got the chair when he was two months old. The first thing that did not work was the vibration panel, we checked batteries and all, but it just did not vibrate, it only produced a strange noise.However, we still loved the chair because our son looked comfortable and happy on it, and he loves to be put on it to watch videos. However, since he learned to sit straight he also discovered that he can pull his torso down, so I've found him three times screaming, with his hands on the floor and half of his body tied to the chair. I am putting some books on the legs of the chair to keep it stable, I just think that this chair does not work well when children learn to sit straigh. Any suggestions to solve my problem?"
5,Very solid,We picked this one due to the option for the child to grow with it. Little did I know that I would appreciate the sturdy base more than anything. We have been visiting at other houses and people have pulled out their bouncy seat - the flimsy ones with a wire base. I feel so much better being able to place my daughter in this chair and having the option of the kick stand. Burns through batteries pretty quick but for the hours she has napped in this chair - it has been worth it.
2,Not As Great as it Seems,"I bought this for my 4 month old daugher. At first, my impression was that it was great. It was very easy to assemble. But once I sat her in it, I thought ""oh my what a bummer"".Although the toys on the toy bar are cute, they are not easy to reach at all. The positions of the seat itself are only good for lying down, and they the baby cant reach the toybar either. But even in the so called sitting up position, its still hard for the baby to reach the toys. ALSO, THE TOYS DONT STAY SECURE. They attach by velcro and if the baby pulls too hard, (which doesnt have to be hard at all) The toys come off of the toy bar.It seems to be comfortable for her though. I suggest getting some of those links to attach to the toy bar so the toys hang down lower, but keep an eye on them so they dont hit themself in the face when the toys come flying off of the bar."
4,Babies of all ages seem to love it!,Before the baby was born the toddlers would play in the chair and try and rock in it(they are still to short for that toddler rocking chair) The baby seems to like the rocking and vibrating at once which is nice since I haven't gotten a swing for him yet and the toddlers still sit in it when its reclined and the stand is holding it up and they fall asleep in it! It's nice that it can hold their weights as well as the infant and one of the toddlers is a big boy(in the 90th percentile for height and 80th for weight) so he actually did fall once when he tried to climb in it at the top so just be careful if you have hyper toddlers who try to climb on everything!
4,A NECESSITY,"As I sit here writing my review, my 12 day old baby is sleeping soundly in her Infant to Toddler Rocker. This is definitely a keeper since she can use it as a newborn up until she's a toddler. You get more for your money. I gave it 4 stars since the material isn't very soft and I have to put a soft blankie on it before I put her in but other than that it's wonderful. When my baby isn't using it my 4 year old son uses it as a rocker when he's watching his favorite cartoon."
5,rock-a-bye baby!!!!!,"I love this bouncer-rocker it is wonderful! It is easy to assemble and my daugther loves it!! It actually vibrates! My little one is only 7 weeks old -we received as a gift at 5 weeks- and she will stare at the animals for a least an hour, and as any new mother knows that is precious time. A added feature is the fact that it grows with the child!! It is one of the best gifts I have received and will give it as a shower gift for sure."
1,This seat tips over,My 8 month old son was reaching for a toy and this product tipped over onto him causing a small bump and scrape on his head. I recently purchased the seat because I thought it was appropriate for my son until he was 40 lbs. (and his other bouncer seat had a 20 lb. weight limit) but obviously it is not safe. I am discontinuing use of this seat immediately and am very disappointed that Fisher Price would not test this seat to ensure safety. I would not recommend this seat to anyone.
3,needs improvement,I am a first time mom with a now 3 month old son. I thought this would be perfect for him. The biggest oversight.....the rocker does not rock by itself. He did not care about the vibration at all. I learned how to keep it moving with my feet. It would be great if fisher-price would add something to keep it rocking without assistance. Another silly thing. The toy bar cannot be used when rocking the chair. The toys swing to close to his face and he gets a bit freaked out. Good thing that the bar is removeable.
3,Not a great bouncer but a pretty good chair,"When my daughter was a brand new infant this was great because it has the ability to lean back into a more vertical position. But the tradional bouncer is much better (I bought both and have used the bouncer 99% of the time and if I were to do it again - would only buy the bouncer) Now this seat is in the way and heaped on top of other things she doesn't use.My daughter justs like the tradional bouncer better. On a more alarming note I think the construction is a bit flimsy. Her daycare has this seat and when I went to remove her from it the entire thing collapsed. This has happened at home also. If you do not have the middle, stabilizing bar fit on just right the whole thing will fold in. After a lot of wear and tear the bar wiggles loose (as is the case at the daycare)"
5,Continuing to use as a Toddler,"Grandma and Grandpa bought this for their house and my son loves it. We are going to buy one for baby # 2. A great design that provides a tool for entertainment. Like any other seat, I would never leave my child unattended."
4,Great! Well worth it!,"I got this instead of a bouncey seat, and then a friend gave me a bouncey seat. I've used this rocker since day one, and my baby loves it! He loves to be rocked in it. I would definitely recommend this rocker over a bouncey seat, although it's very nice to have both, since they spend so much time in these chairs for the first several months. The toy bar on the rocker is nicer than the one on the bouncey seat too."
2,"""This may require a lot of force""","Bright cheerful colors! From infant-to-toddler! Vibrates the little one to sleep! Couldn't be better, right? WRONG. Now, I'm not the most knowladgable person on this planet, but when putting something together, I've got what it takes to read a manual. So, when I was having difficulties putting the cross brace on, I read the manual. Still having problems. Read it again. No luck. Had my best friend try to put it on after reading the manual. She had no luck. Had my 6'4"", 260lbs, husband try... and he says, ""I'm not going to do this anymore because if I put any more force on it, it's going to break."" In other words... ""it just ""don't"" work."" I'm taking it back today."
2,Not a very good infant seat,"I registered for this infant seat because I liked the fact that it could be converted to a toddler seat, but I have been very disapointed with its performance as an infant seat. My son couldn't reach the toys on the bar until he was 6 months old. This led to much fustration on his part. The seat isn't very interactive, in hindsight I wish I would have gotten a seat that responded to his movements. The only thing I like about this seat opposed to other infant seats is the kickstand. This allows a very young infant to be completly reclined so their head doesn't slump forward."
5,LOVE IT!,I put the baby in there when he was six weeks old. Now he bats at the objects or even falls asleep. It is great. Lightweight too so you can take it with you to grandmoms. The only downside to this chair is that you have to take the toy bar off to get the baby in and out of the chair not a big deal though.
4,A Good Buy,"We got this as a gift and I was hesitant about its use at first but now I see it definitely has a purpose in our home. Our baby sits in it happily while we eat dinner. She also enjoys the mobile. In fact when she played with that mobile it was the first time we saw her play. The vibration is not exactly a thrill for our baby so we leave it off. I also wish the item folded down a bit more for travel, but it is certainly easier to travel with than her swing, so we endure because its a great item to take when you are visiting friends and family for dinner or chatting."
3,It's average,"My son is 5 months and can still use it,but he is easily bored while sitting there.And the batteries were always dying in the thing."
4,Great Item,I love this rocker it is so versital. You can take it anywhere and my son loves to use it. that was a major thing. I think that the only thing that could make this better is maybe for there to be a detachable feeding tray. I say that cause livig in a small appartment there isn't any room for a highchair so we feed the babies in their rockers. No matter how you look at it this is a great item.
1,Not safe for babies...,"I was going to buy this one but went with another with the Deluxe take along swing also from Fisher Prize cause this one seems to be very light and can easily just tilt over or if the babies try to reach for the toys it'll go forward with them. The Deluxe Take Along Swing don't do that.Martha, NYC"
2,Not Practical,"The selling point to this item is that it is both an infant bouncer and a toddler rocker. As a bouncer, it is simply too big. An infant bouncer should be small and light enough to carry the baby around in and to place onto a table for feedings. The toy bar looks deceptively like a carry handle. However, any attempt to lift it by the toy bar will result in the toy bar detatching. That scares me. It seems great as a toddler rocker, but it is a stretch to combine two items into one."
4,Great for all Ages,"My daughter is 4 now, and she still sits and reads stories in this over her grandmothers house, when she was first introduced to solids this was a great high chair, And she always loved spending time with it. Now 4 years ago there were no toys attached and it just vibrated in the back she loved it. Someone mentioned something about it tipping over, i think that the back should always be set so it doesnt rock if you are not right there, and a child should always be buckled if they can not easily climb in and out by themselves, also a child should never be left unattended. This is a great product from fisherprice worth the small investment"
1,Other reviewers are right- this product is dangerous!,"This product should be recalled- I'm apalled it hasn't been yet. My 9 month old leaned over while strapped in securely (or so I thought), while he was in the same room as me, I heard him make a funny squeal, I look over and he's leaning all the way forward , with his head touching the floor, all his blood rushing to his head I'm sure, unable to move himself from the position he was in...he was ok thank goodness! But this is just unacceptable! I'm calling Fisher Price tomorrow to get my refund!"
4,"finally, one that works!","As the mother of twin boys, we needed almost 2 of everything including bouncers. We had horrible luck and went through 6 bouncers (3 each) because the motors on the vibrate mode kept dying on us. FINALLY, we found the toddler rocker and it was great! The motors still work, though they no longer use the chairs. I highly recommed this! One drawback is one your kids are big enough to really move around, they need supervision with this (no setting them in there and heading to another room for several minutes) seat. Both of my boys were able to flip themselves out of it; that was scary for all of us and one ended up busting his lip pretty badly because of it."
4,Great Chair,"I started out using the Kick and Play bouncer when my son was born. After about 4 months of using the bouncer, my son had begin using this rocker. While this rocker is great since it's so versitile and grows with the child, it doesn't ""bounce."" I have noticed that my son enjoys the bouncer more than the rocker since he is very active and he doesn't have to try hard to make the bouncer move but has to try hard to make the rocker move. This rocker is great for later but if your child is active, I would definitely recommend the bouncer."
5,A MUST HAVE - BETTER THAN BOUNCY SEAT,"I have one of these rockers, not this exact model, but I would be lost without it. This is so much better than a bouncy seat, which I also have, but this really grows with your child they can use it for a lot longer and keeps them further up off the floor."
3,Not safe for infants who are starting to sit up,"Our son loved this rocker as a newborn (1-2 months). We pulled out the ""kickstand"" and that allowed him to be in a flat position and he was very comfortable. Most bouncers are too upright fro newborns. Also, the rocker has two recline positions for you baby's comfort.As he got older (3-4 months), we would push in the ""kickstand"" in so we could use the rocking feature. He liked being more upright than flat at this age. He liked to look around and play with the toy bar. Also, we could rock him to sleep.But, once (around 5-6 months) when he was trying to sit up and lean forward he fell over (the reason for 3 stars only). He was strapped in, so the chair fell over with him. I was in the same room as he was and he is fine - he was just a bit startled.(Think about sitting in a rocking chair and leaning forward - if you cannot lean back then you would fall forward.)I put it away for now and will try it when he can climb in and out of the rocker on his own."
3,Good product but vibrator do not do any magic,"I bought this for my 5 weeks old daughter.The vibrator does not calm the baby but rocker do. so you have to sit with the baby to rock her which defeats the whole purpose of yours to be free and do your work.I think it is better to buy a swing that will do rocking automaticallyOtherwise product is great, the characters are lovely and colorful and this rocker can be used until the baby is toddler."
1,UNSAFE - BEWARE,"This chair is not designed properly. A small child that leans forward can tip the chair over causing serious injury to themself. I do not see how this company can market this product as it is so unsafe! I have always been worried for my baby while she was in this chair, and after a near accident, I stopped using this. Furthermore, the seat area has very little padding and your baby is sitting on a flat board - how comfortable do you think that is for them? Other reviewers also point out this saftey problem but seems like most people are not concerned with their childs safety and buy this anyway. Do yourself a favor and look to buy something else."
5,Flawless connection - PC and MAC,"This device has worked perfectly and flawlessly for both my legacy MAC and my Dell PC; I use it with an Iomega SCSI Jaz drive to back up these as well as my kid's iMac. Installation doesn't get any simpler. One caveat: the SCSI drive is just as tempermental as it always was - don't blame the converter! E.g., the drive must be on and loaded before your computer is turned on for the drive and ""removable media"" to be recognized at start-up; from there, the removable media can be removed, swapped, etc. At least that's been my experience."
4,Very pretty and excellent quality for price.,"This necklace looks the same in real life as it does in the picture, and I think it is both very pretty and high-quality in appearance. It was delivered promptly and in a nice box. I liked it so much I wore it for my wedding! The image does not show the rest of the chain--which is a sort of fine box-chain. One star off because I would have preferred a smoother-looking chain to fit the polish of the front of the necklace, and because the sapphires were not quite perfectly set (although you could only tell with close scrutiny). A very good value for price and I would certainly buy similar items from this company again."
1,Sad sequel,"I read Lonely Furrow years ago and was anxious to read the sequel, The Homecoming. What a disappointment!! The story opens with the man character having returned after 8 years away from the woman he loves, their home and children. He is accompanied by the 16-year-old girl who rescued him from slavery. She's pregnant with his child - a fact that cannot be concealed from his adoring and faithful wife. Before the book is 1/2 over, the main characters above are out of the picture and the story is focussing on another generation. Unfortunately, this new generation is boring with poorly developed characters and uninteresting story-lines. I could have cared less what was going to happen to them.Read Loney Furrow and just know that true love prevails and don't bother with this sequel."
2,Sounds Good but more negatives than positives for me,"Pros: Good sound and fairly easy to use; unit looks nice; remote control; sleep feature- can fall asleep to radio or IPOD. Wake feature- awake to radio or IPODCons: PLEASE believe me...display is WAY TOO BRIGHT for use as a bedroom clock-even at the ""dim"" setting. There is an alarm setting but no snooze button- this is advertised as a table radio NOT an alarm clock; you can use station presets but only access them from the remote; when the radio or IPOD is used for alarm- be prepared to get blasted out of bed-lowest setting is a 10. It ramps up the volume when the alarm goes off but it happens so fast it's still quite a shock.Great for ""table radio use"" Not so good for clock radio use."
3,Has Possibilities,"I brought the Teach Hi-Fidelity from Costco today for $39 a very good price. Unfortunately I plan on returning it.The good:1. Excellent price.2. Sounds very good, with good base for the size and price.3. My iPod Video fit perfectly and sounded good.4. The controls where fairly easy to figure out.5. Bright and big clock screen.6. Remote very handy and a surprise at such a low price. It even had basic iPod controls.The bad (deal breaker):1. I had trouble getting good AM or FM reception. Only a few stations came in without a lot of static. I tried several locations. This was the primary reason I brought for better sounding FM.2. The clock was very bright even when dimmed - would be an issue when trying to sleep.Final Comments:I might return it for another unit to see if I get better reception. The problem is the clock is so bright even if I can tolerate it, my wife will probably complain it's too bright."
5,Great Product,"Yesterday I purchased TEAC GR-10i from Costco for 79.99. Original price is 99.99, but I got additional $20 Off coupon from Costco (till May 28th, this coupon is valid). I am surprised when I plugged in my Ipod video to this. Sound is amazing. Except bright display (this got dimmer option too, but with dimmer it is still bright :-)), I dont have any other compaints. Great Product!"
1,"Awful, TEAC does not honor warranty from this seller!","This radio broke and will not function at all after in the 10th month. North Star said it was still under warranty, but TEAC does not recognize North Star as a legitimate seller and will not honor warranty. So I'm stuck with a $113 door stop. It's doesn't deserve one star but I couldn't give it less."
2,"Lacks Purpose, Authenticity and Passion","Reading this book was like listening to someone moan about the subject. It felt to me like the author had somehow been forced to write about the voice, whilst really wanting to write about something else. There are certainly some interesting facts, and some myths expelled. But for me, there was no passion, and also little sense of the author having any real experience of working with the voice. Imagine someone who does no physical exercise at all writing a book about the amazing human body and you will get some idea of what this book was like for me. A kind of flat essay."
1,Profoundly disappointing,"It would be hard to express how irritating this book is. The human voice is indeed an amazing instrument, but it is ill-served by the pop sociology, psychobabble, and profound disrespect for science contained in this book (along with a number of errors of fact). A good work of popular science should find the interest in ""dry"" scientific findings and make them accessible to a broader audience, not disparage them in favor of man-in-the-street opinions. I suggest Ms. Karpf rein in her adjectives and look harder for what science has to offer in her future works. She will produce a more readable, more interesting product if she does."
5,This works great,I really like this product - it works well for me in controlling hot flashes. I've tried to go without it and been miserable.
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I'm a 61 year old woman who recently was taken off my hormone patch and found I needed something to help me with my hot flashes. Thank heavens for the gentlemen at the Vitamin Store who suggested this product. When asked he gave me several choice but suggested this one overall all.After purchasing elsewhere, I was very pleased to find this product on line with a cost I couldn't refuse. Thank you so much for the great product, price and speedy deliver time. Hope to do business with you in the near future."
4,Bought this because of other reviews.. hoping...,I've been using this for about a month and perhaps that is not long enough. So far I have not noted a difference. I'm truly hoping for the best though after reading all of the other reviews. I'll come back later and post more.
1,Not really sure,I purchased this produce a little over a month ago. I can't say that I feel any different. I am still experiencing the hot flashes. i noticed that when you rub the cream on there is a slight sensation. From what I understand this product claims to be like or as close to real hormones. It does not seem to be doing anything for me as it claims. I will continue to use this product until it is finished. Maybe it has to get into your system?
5,Great,I started using this along with pro-gest and together they have regulated my hormones perfectly. I had a complete hysterectomy and went into surgical menopause.
2,Hard Core Disappointment,"It seems like Hard Core Logo is an example of a book that was not quiet as good as the film that was made out of it. Perhaps I expected too much upon seeing the excellent film first, but I can't help but be disappointed with the book. It's novel in verse format is clever, although skimpy. I feel that Turner had a great story to tell, but left out all the best parts. The characters are underdeveloped and the whole story feels empty and unfulfilling. It is a very short book (it took me about three times as long to watch the movie than read the book), and while this is not necessarily a bad thing, I felt that there had to be more in this book to make it work. A great idea, a great basis for a movie, this book is a bit too hollow to be thoroughly enjoyed. Check out American Whisky bar instead, it's way better and a great book in itself."
1,Garbage,This was the worst buy I have ever made. I bought these for some light computer related work and the heads CRUMBLED! A little bit of pressure to loosen a tight screw and they just broke. Almost like they were made of graphite. I have never broken a screwdriver bit on a small computer screw but I guess there is a first time for everything. After the 3rd head broke I returned it to Home Depot where I originally bought it. Save yourself some frustration and get a QUALITY set from another manufacturer. This product is GARBAGE!
3,Check compatibility before you buy,"While this is a great idea, it is not compatible with as many printers as I was lead to believe. The Entrega website only listed 2 Lexmark printers that were incompatible. When I receieved the product 4 more Lexmarks joined that list. Now I can add mine to the list as well. If you have a Lexmark 2030, 2050, 2070, 6000, or 7000, this converter will not work. With most other models you must disable the bi-directional communication feature of the printer, which is a valuable feature.I would suggest contacting your specific printer company before purchasing a device such as this."
3,ONE SIDED,"A good idea, how eager was I to find out there was actually a book about the ""Anglophone Problem"" even though I have read alot of what is here in Newspapers. The authors take upon themselves to state certain facts about the South West and completely leave out any analyses of the North West. Talking about their anaylses on what the North West-South West divide.Several other issues are treated lightly. This is a nice try but a book mostly one to be read from generations to generations needs to give us an unbaised analyses. We still need a book on what the real problem of one of the minorities in Cameroon is about.Someone give us a fair account."
4,Best Peter White Album,"This is by an large the best of the Peter White CDs (I have them all). The compilations with Dave Koz (Glow) is wonderful. Also, When I'm Alone is gorgeous."
5,"AMAZING,... just like he's live","I just recently saw Peter White in concert and he is amazing on his acoustic guitar,... he plays it like an electric and really gets into it. This CD is one of his best and I just had to have it: Bueno Funk is the star of the show, but his ode to the Isley Brother's Who's that Lady gets a standing ovation. He is wonderfully artistic and innovative with his choice of phrasing and move of his music,... definitely smooth jazz. Even the Isley's would be proud. The rest of the CD is enjoyable and you can just put this one in and let it play,... really wonderful to relax to."
4,not at the top of the stack,"I heard Peter White on the radio and figured I should add his CD to my list. I always forget that I have this CD and thats a sign. I do have alot of music but, my favorites are always at the top of the stack. After I've tired of them and I'm scronging for something else I see GLOW and go, OH YEAH. Once I play it, I'm happy with it, I never go UGH and skip tracks or anything like that, but it's not enough to keep me in the car until a particular cut finishes either."
5,My First Exposure To Peter White,"I'd never heard of Peter White before hearing his music at the place where I get cappuccino. ""glow"" was the only Peter White CD available at a local music shop. It is fantastic. I'd never heard most of the cuts on it. ""chasing the dawn"" is a perfect opening. It starts softly and ramps up a kind of quiet or subdued energy in a hurry. ""who's that lady"" and "" and ""just my imagination"" are super arrangements of familiar music. Although ""when I'm alone"" and ""life story"" are favorites, there is no cut on this CD that I skip to get to another. As a long distance commuter, this CD gets a lot of play time. It's soft enough to ease me into what is sure to be a hectic day and settles me out when the day been hectic. This is great music both as background when I'm working or cranked up to shut out the world. The rhythms keep a foot tapping or my head bobbing. This is an all day, all night CD."
5,the glow,"The glow is smooth jazz. The kind that make you feel good all over.A friend recommended this cd,and Im glad I purchased it. Thanks to Amazon it was only a click away.The price was right."
4,artistically correct,"At times when music is reviewed we as ""public"" reviewers tend to forget what genre music we are reviewing or perhaps are expecting something else to be heard from what we are listening to. Such is a dilemma with ""smooth ""Jazz. Labelled as Jazz could be a misnomer, in which lies the dilemma. But saying that, on the other hand there are varying levels or styles of "" Jazz"" and this type of music that Mr. White offers definitely falls into the smooth Jazz category, as it so is called. Nothing more, nothing less. So it is unfair to give a poor rating on an artist`s work after listening expecting to hear something which the artist in question is not the style he/she is presenting, or maybe what the artist wants to present to his buying and expecting fans. Peter White presents just nice rhythmic, mostly instrumental, melodious, tuneful, subdued ""Jazz"" music. Which if your a Smooth Jazz listener you should enjoy.Nice work."
1,GLOW IS NOT SO GLOWING!!,I agree with the reviewer who said Peter has just thrown us bone I heard this at a friend's home.too much of a Latin touch..too of a same sound...he is too talented to let this quality suffice ......Come on Peter.... I will not buy this one..thank for the review...
1,Music of past artists Repeated,I was given peter white's cd by a co-worker as birthday present. I don't see what is new in melodies or performance.I recommend you spend your money on legends like George Benson and other fine original artist.
5,Kickin back in Milwaukee,"This CD has many tracks that need the repeat play setting. One or MAYBE 2 are so-so, but overall this is a great CD for PW fans. Perfect to have on while relaxing with the SUnday morning coffee and paper, or anytime you want to forget the days stress. I recommend it!"
5,This is a must have,"The programming on this CD is wonderful. And the recording and mastering of this CD is so excellent that it captures and replays a ""peter-white"" brand sound so clean and pure. I love each track on this CD. And my favorate would be track #1,7,9,10,11."
5,Fabulous...Mr. White really does Glow!!!,"I absolutely adore Peter White and love nearly everything he does. He is such a talented musician!!! He takes my breath away. This CD will surely not disappoint and will make you a fan if you are not already. I think the best cuts are ""Chasing the Dawn"", ""Pedro Blanco"", ""Glow"" and ""Life Story"". There was a Borders exclusive on this CD with 2 extra titles so see if you can hunt down a copy... Also check him out with The Rippingtons and Third Force. He's JUST fabulous!!!!"
4,Fantastic!!,"This is the best Peter White CD ever!!! I have the ""Perfect Moment"" CD as well, and it's great!! I listen to both all of the time. I wish Peter would put out more CD's...he's terrific! I've listened to Joyce Cooling, Paul Taylor, Kevin Toney, Art Porter, Gregg Karukas, Stanton Moore, Jeff Lorber, Steve Cole, Marion Meadows, etc., etc......and nothing compares! Peter is the best!"
5,Takes Me Away,"This CD is very enjoyable to listen. Very relaxing, yet uplifting. It's like a escape from it all, allows you to have a clear focus once more."
3,Not worth $85.00,"I'm using this book for my undergrad political science class on research design and statistical analysis. I have previously used Johnson and Joslyn's book, which is much less expensive than Manheim and Rich. If I had known that the bookstore would charge the students so much, I would not have assigned it. The authors do a good job with research design, but the statistical section is poorly organized, and has at least one formula incorrect. If you are looking for a good book on empirical political analysis, you could probably find a better research design book and a better statistics book for about the same price."
4,1930's Alice in Wonderland,"Faithful rendition of many components of Alice in Wonderland & Alice Through the Looking Glass. Produced in 1930's, has cameos by big screen stars of that era but none of significant on-screen duration. B&W since produced before colorization, representative of movies produced in that era."
3,I wonder too . ..,"This 1930's adaptation is interesting mostly for the game of spot-the-actor you can play. Overall the film is pretty boring except for the Tweedle-Dum/Dee sequence, which is rather lively. Of course I like almost anything with W.C.Fields (Humpty Dumpty)but even Cary Grant and Gary Cooper are wasted."
3,IFFY!,"Well, this has finally been reissued and, given that one of my 7th grade classes is studying the book, I got it on amazon for under ten bucks watched it last night. VERY ODD!! Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, WC Fields...you'd think it would be much better. The ancient SpFX are cool, the blend of film/animated bits tolerable, the masks and costumes quite remarkable, and the sets like 3D versions of the stuff in the background of the more druggy Betty Boop cartoons.But the film zips along far too quickly, the script is a illogical mishmash of fragments of the original text, and what really put the chap on my ass was how the film STUPIDLY combines both of Carroll's Alice books into a surrealistic hash.Still, as an oddity from the past, I'm glad I've experienced it."
1,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen!,"Suffice it to say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Not an ounce of wit; the pacing was like slogging through wallpaper paste in snowshoes. The movie was apparently cut down to 77 minutes from the original 90. It should have been cut to 77 seconds...and it still would have been boring! At least at $1.99, which is what I paid for it at GoHastings, it wasn't overpriced! Extremely disappointing, since I'd always heard this was a forgotten classic. It SHOULD be forgotten! You're better off with another Paramount ""all-star"" film from the same year of 1933, INTERNATIONAL HOUSE. Far funnier!"
3,Sweet Little Movie!,"This is a sweet little movie-with an outstanding cast, and nice special effects. I especially liked the White Knight portrayal by Gary Cooper, a departure from the usual cartoony versions that have been done since. I would recommend this for the whole family."
5,The best Lecuona series out there,"Phenomenal-This disc really blew me away. Tirino's other discs in this series on the BIS label were extraordinary-but here he tackles for his final volume some of the popular elements of Lecuona's compositional style, and surpasses all expectations. WOW! Such Cuban style in his playing, the arrangements, and playing of others-the first three Afro-Cuban Dances made me want to dance. I recommend this disc highly, even to those who don't like classical music. Tirino and Lecuona are one in the same as far as I'm concerned, and no one can touch him!"
4,Tales of the Southwest,"An excellent collection of short stories about the Southwest--its history, its fauna and flora, its people, and just a little about where it may be going if suburbia continues to encroach.At its best, Bruce's writing style verges on poetry, refining the imagery into a few well chosen lines that beg to be read and read again. The very short story about the Metaphysical Tent is one the best short pieces I have read."
1,This is not the product for Razr,"This product is advertised for Razr phone, but when i received this case... The story is totally different.This is a very big case and exactly two razr phones can fit in this.Definitely NOT the product I wanted."
5,"Bach: Cantatas, Vol 11 (BWV 136, 138, 95, 46) /Bach Collegium Japan Suzuki","Bach: Cantatas, Vol 11 (BWV 136, 138, 95, 46) /Bach Collegium Japan Suzuki is a recording under the direction of Masaaki Suzuki who leads the Bach Collegium Japan on NEC and Lufthansa German Air recording from 1999. Being a huge fan of Bach listening to this amazing series of Bach recordings is true bliss and once more Suzuki has created an amazing recording. Peter Kooij is tremendous and his performance is truly astounding. Highly recommended. 5/5."
1,waste of money,"This item broke the second time my daughter played with it. The sponge bob one has lasted over a year, but this patrick one is a waste of money. I am glad others said the same thing because I was considering buying another one. I won't now."
2,The first movie is great; the second is incomprehensible.,"Fearless Hyena Part I was excellent. The action and comedy worked well together and once again, we get to see Jackie Chan at his best. But the sequel was impossible for me to understand, as the entire original cast was back but the guy who played Jackie's grandpa in Part I now plays his father? What's up with that? And the final fight scene of Part II rips off clips from the final scene from Part I. Very disappointing. But the good side is you get 2 movies for the price of one!"
5,All-Time classic kung fu movies by Jackie Chan!,These martial art films proved that Jackie Chan was going to be the next Bruce Lee. The movie has some good action scenes with a few stunt devils in the film and very funny comedy punchlines with it's dialouge too it here. Trust me these are true classic kung fu cinema in motion picture history that made Chan a superstar!
2,Don't bother with part II,"Fearless Hyena is a fun, standard-issue early Jackie film, well worth seeing for any Kung Fu lover. The fights are all humorous, including a lot of great propwork as well as a fight in drag. The film isn't all that special, but I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it, and it has some great moments. Fearless Hyena II is an absolute dog, however, and I wouldn't recommend it even for free. The storyline is so convoluted it is too confusing even to laugh AT, let alone laugh with. Buy the first film if you like early Chan films, but don't bother with the second."
3,"Good enough, but...",The story was...fine. But am I the only one who thinks that Native American men on Ms. Edwards's book covers look more like Favio than an American Indian? She should really just let us use our imagination. That killed it for me...those covers...
3,Not one of Cassie's best works...,"I love Cassie Edwards, but this must have been one of the earlier Savage Series books, It appealed to me when I read it at 17, but now at 23....there's no attraction to the story. I'm sorry, but Cassie Edwards has written better stories than this."
5,A story of a teen who finally discovers who he is.,"This book,{Breaking Boxes} by A.M Jenkins was truly touching. The plot focus is on Charlie Calmont, who is very much a teenage loner. He has grown up with both of his parents gone, and has lived with his older brother Trent. Everything is fine until he gets into a fight at school. He and one of the guys he got into the fight w/ {Brandon} both have on campus suspension. Charlie thinks nothing of it, then Brandon gives him a ride home. They become friends and through Charlie, Brandon sees how superficial his world is. Until Charlie reveals somehthing to Brandon that threatens to rip their friendship apart, then they have one last fight....."
1,The characters in this story had few redeeming qualities,"This story left me feeling very unhappy with the state of Young Adult literature. I recognized the basic idea behind the book to show the angst and termoil in the teen years and the difficulity in dealing with homosexuality at that age, however I found myself feeling very sorry for the children in this story. I never saw any real progress in the improvement of the Charlie character and I felt the book had a lot of negative messages. Unprotected teen sex with no mention of abstenince, drinking to solve your problems and make things ""fun"", fighting to solve conflicts, and a general distain for teachers. I will not be offering this book to my teen to read."
5,Breaking Boxes - Breaking the Barries in Teenage Readings.,"Breaking Boxes clearly brakes the traditional barrier in teenage readings. It effectively deals with contemporary issues incl. alcoholism, domestic violence and homosexuality that are often avoided or dealt relunctantly in young adult literature. AM Jenkins's potrayal of the characters are all thorough and emotionally touching. It's an excellent reading for both young adults and adults alike.Personally I would include Breaking Boxes as one of my old-time favorites."
3,It was something...,"I thought it was nice, and only nice, mind you. It wasn't that the writing was bad. Heaven's no- the writing was brilliant, for god's sake, that was the best part! However, the book beside the writing- meaning the plot, the charactors, the setting- was a little on the boring side for my taste and I'm only saying that because the book is somewhat long and yet nothing really interesting happens, but don't let something silly like that stop you from reading it."
1,Wrong charger,"Beware of this product. It is only for these Nokia models: 1260 1261 2270 3285 3220. If you have another model that is listed in the description, you should look elsewhere for a charger."
5,unlimited expandibility,"when i started looking around for a hub, i was just looking for a simple one-to-four usb hub. But when I saw this amazing product all of my viewpoint has changed. This product enables you to expand your options indefinitely. Especially if you use an external parallel port modem plus a printer and a palmtop device like palm3x which uses a serial port, this device will be the only option to consider."
1,Not very helpful,"Rather than deal with the program this book assumes one knows nothing about databases and spends most of the time on that subject. There are very few useful examples. If it were rewritten like many of the other dummies books with lots of useful examples, especially for people who know about data bases but not this program it might be worth buying. As it is I would not recomennd it."
1,"Confusing, not helpful, unorganized",I found this book to be extremely confusing in its layout and organization. Books such as this must be intuitive in form and content. It is not. The help file in the program is definately more useful. I returned it.
5,This thing is so cool,"I was the happiest otaku in the world when I got this for christmas, it's just so cool! One word of advice, don't bring it to school to show it off like I did. I ended up dropping it in the hallway and the front cover snapped off, and now it's being held together with a rubber band. I definitely don't blame the product, just myself for being an idiot."
3,Okay,"I got this for Christmas. I used it to Duel with at championchips a couple times. After about 4 months my friend gave me 7 bucks for it. I looked it up and it costs 8 on the internet! I know that that dosn't matter but, Overall this calculater is not all that great. You don't need a *YUGIO* calculator just a regular one. Plus this is a lot of money. Well that proves how Yu-gi-o has taken over people minds in buying stuff for 10 bucks. lol"

1,waste of money,ud expect a caculater that kept track of life points . but paying 7 dollers for a normal calculater i mean buy a 2 doller one save ur money ..... and ur time i rate it 1
4,"Quick, satisfying read","The follow-up book to Belle Prater's Boy was satisfying. While it wasn't quite as enchanting as the first book, it did intrigue and entertain this reader. I would recommend it to anyone who read the first book, although the new book summarizes the basic plot, so it's not completely a necessity. Great book!"
3,"They're not kidding when they say its ""advanced"" rigging.","This is definitely not a book for beginners. My biggest issue with the book is that it gives you a bunch of step by step instructions without explaining why you're doing what you're doing. The books gives complex rigging examples without giving the main concepts behind them. The instructions are often times unclear and the pictures, which would probably explain things better than the text, are too small to be of any use. I guess since the title specifically says it's ""advanced rigging"" I shouldn't complain, but it seems like the only people who can follow this book are people who already know how to do this stuff."
2,Poor Presentation,"I will second doodler's review; the content is in there somewhere, but the presentation is horrible. Pictures are unable to convey any information whatsoever do to their tiny size. Adding to the difficulty in following the instruction are the seemingly endless typos on node names, such as a dropped suffix or a dropped prefix. Whole steps seem to left out of other areas and the errata from the Course Tech website seems to contain only a fraction of the mistakes. This makes actually learning anything in a reasonable amount of time utterly impossible since you will spend most of your time trying to decipher what is a typo and what is not."
3,Does what is is supposed to,"I use this book to teach a contracts class for collegiate students. It is decent in that it does teach the nuts and bolts of contracts. What is missing though is the entertainment of a good read. Mixing a little narrative in with such a boring topic helps readers stay motivated. But, as I said, it is a good book for what it is designed to do and will certainly teach you the structure and purpose of contracting."
4,The Prodigal Daughter,"Mary E. Sims gives the reader an in-depth view of her trials and tribulations in her autobiography, GOING HOME ANOTHER WAY. Sims takes the reader on a journey through her life beginning with her early upbringing in the church, to her bouts with a bad marriage and crack addiction, and ends with her realization that the very thing she spent her life searching for was right there all along.Spiritual, but not preachy, GOING ON ANOTHER WAY, shows that at one time or another we all make mistakes, but it is up to each individual to learn from their mistakes or be doomed to recreate them. Sims' story often reads more like a diary or a vent than a novel, but it only makes the novel more gripping, inspirational, and real.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-QawiyyOf The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
2,Heaviest Watch Ever,This is great looking watch at a good price but very heavy. I am unable to wear this watch with activities like golf and tennis.
1,TOO MUCH,VERY HEAVY AND LARGE. ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE IN THE WAY. MOST IRRITATING WAS IT RAN DOWN EVERY NIGHT AND STOPPED BECAUSE THERE IS NO POWER SOURCE. I SENT IT BACK.
1,returns,"I recently 11/24/12 purchased a few band saw blades from grizzly and mistakely had wrong model number so the lenght was wrong so I packaged them back up and returned them immediately with letter explaining what was wrong, my info , the invoice and all my contacts numbers, I have no response, not a call and no record that I paid the return shipping back to the same address it came from, This is going on 3 months now so I assume I am dealing with a company so big it cannot care about the small customers. I will remember though Steve Messing"
4,Aldiss gives us Mary Shelly and her 19th century society,"Unfortunatly, I only read the book a number of years ago, but I really enjoy Aldiss' books. Frankenstien is one of several of his works to become screen plays with uneven results. Our hero finds himself time shifted (like K. Vonnegurt's quake) to 19th century Austria where soon meets the proto-hippies, Mary Shelley, Percy and their romantic commune. Soon Dr. Frankenstien apprears with the real monster. My memory of the story is fairly vague, although I recall our hero still has his late model car and digital watch. A lot of twists and coincidences later find our hero and the monster at the north pole searching for the answer, in their fashion, of what is life anyway. It well worth the read to find out."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Timeslip man meets monster and creator, both fictional and non.A bloke ends up in one of those weird time accidents, as you do, and basically ends up in the scenario from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein novel. However, he is an extra character, and tries to prevent the murder trial. The monster has other plans.To make things weirder, said bloke then ends up with Shelley and company at the origin of this tale."
1,Gag me,"Turgid, juvenile, witless, inconsistent, pointless, flaccid. Reads like the kind of ""You Are There"" episode a teenage boy would write, featuring of course sex with the historical figure of ones choice. I got the impression that Aldiss fell asleep at the typewriter several times during the writing of the manuscript, and resumed upon waking with whatever popped into his head, without respect for what had just been written. Bad as the movie was, I conclude that it was an improvement over the book."
5,Trekker/Trekies,Welcome to the world of the original and still best version of the Star Trek universe. I'm glad these movies weren't treated like the original Star Wars trilogy and re-done with CGI images. The weak story lines on Search for Spock and The Final Frontier still can't take away from the rest of this must have collection.
5,Star Trek Original Cast Movies and beyond!,"The most important Star Trek Movies Collection that all fans should have. Excellent sound, image and many languages options. Excellent Extras material, live On-Line extras. excellent product and fast delivering!"
5,Great set,Product was shipped very fast and the movies were very crisp as a blu-ray should be. Don't understand why others complained.
5,Buy it!,"I just got this set, and I must say it's incredible how clean and cristal clear this movies are. I was skeptical at first, because many negative reviews, but I wanted this collection in Blu-ray, for some time now, and I'n not dissapointed. The sound is incredible if you have a good sound system, and the image is pristine is you have a 1080p/24p capable TV.Don't listen to the nay sayers out there, buy it now!"
5,Picture & Audio Quality are Fantastic!,"My only issue with these films is that they are the original Theatrical versions. That's fine but they already released them on regular DVD. Why on earth would Paramount not release the Special Edition or Directors Cut versions on Blu-Ray and take advantage of the extra space these discs have?Anyway, overall I am very happy with the films picture and audio quality."
2,Mass marketing ploy,"Paramount is just trying to cash in on the release of the new Star Trek movie! If the movies are still going to remain 480 they will look grainy anyway at 1080! They should have done this right and taken the time and effort, but who's saying they won't later on and we trek fans will buy them all the same. It's our lot in life."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS! SEND A MESSAGE TO PARAMOUNT!,.DO NOT BUY THIS. PARAMOUNT WILL BE RELEASING THE DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSIONS OF ALL SIX FILMS ONCE THEY MILK THIS VERSION DRY.STOP!!!DO NOT BE A FOOL!!!SAVE YOU MONEY!!!
2,Star Trek Movies On Blu-ray,"This is one of the reasons why Blu-ray still needs the compatition such as HD-DVD. They can come out with just the garbage they want, to buy again & again. They are not forced to come out with a better product. Yes, these are all great movies, that deserve a better restoration. They won't though, & when the Star Trek 11 comes out on Blu-ray in 6 months, there will be another version of these movies. Blu-ray is beginning to suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Why? Oh Why?,"I bought the special editions DVDs when they came out... Why would i buy this inferior product? 1080p is definitely cool, but it's as much about the actual movies as the technology. Inferior content with better technology just doesn't cut it for me. I can wait a couple of years to get the right package. Look at how the Star Trek Original Series was released on Blu-Ray! That's what i call a great release. For this one, thanks but no thanks: i'll wait."
3,Star Trek Original Motion Picture Collection,"The set arrived in excellent shape, the only problem was it was Blu-Ray and I do not have that player. It would be nice if you could get the set in DVD."
1,Continuing rip off,"I mean, what is the point? Are the movie companies so broke that they cannot just do their very best (and brushed over movies put into Blu-Ray format is not their best) and give the public something of value?All of them seem to be trying to see how many ways they can sell the same thing that they severely cheapen their product and their name because it seems they are only interested in the money. I suspect they would actually make more money if they did the right thing and made everything they do their very best instead of everything they do always a lot of not quite and almost there and close but no cigar."
1,Double Dip Alert!,"There will be a second set of Star Trek Movies for sure. This one is missing the special cuts from the previous set. I normally watch them original cut, but for $100 this should have both cuts of the special editions.Very disappointing."
1,Weak!,"If you like Star Trek you hate this item! You might think its a great deal, but your missing key scenes....buy the director's cut."
1,For a Friend,David loves all these movies in one box. He took them from Denver to Seattle on a trip with his DVD player and it made the long trip driving with a friend a lot better. He also plays them at home. Thank you.
5,Fast Delivery,"If you are a Star Trek fan this is an item to live without. After I bought it I was anxious for it to arrive. I did super saver shipping and to my surprise it came two days earlier than expected. Great stuff. Kudos to the delivery, forgive my pun, the trek to get here was worth the while."
5,Australian Fan,"I have bee a fan of Star Trek for 30 years. I watched all the movies on VHS and then DVD. When I found the release of the 6 movies on Blu Ray I could not wait. Watched the 6 movies over 1 week and enjoyed the fantastic quality of picture and HD sound. I just wish the Motion Picture companies would use 16 x 9 as the format so we can all get a full picture on our HD panels. Can't wait for the next 4 to be released.Regards, Alan HenningAustralia"
2,Be warned -- these are not the new directors versions,"Nice to have the movies on Blu-Ray, but be warned -- these are old versions of the movies, not the newly released Directors Cuts. Paramount has gone George Lucas!"
3,Marginal,"Bare minimum that Paramount had to do to get these films out on Blu-Ray. Disappointing actually considering how loyal Trek fans are with their dollars. Why not include the Directors Cuts? They have already been released in SD! One can only assume that Paramount wants to double dip the hardcore fans. Yes, fans will rush out to buy these movies on BR with the new movie coming out. Then, in about a year from now, I am sure they will release the directors cuts.I for one will save my $$ (especially these days) and wait to see if a true definitive version comes out..."
4,Star Trek - 1st 6,"I haven't had a chance to watch any of the special features, but the Blu-ray quality is really good. Of course I had them on VHS before this."
3,Blu-Ray Big Deal?,"Purchased this product for a Father's Day present. My dad loved it but I still am not quite so certain there is ""such a huge diffrence"" between blu-ray and regular DVD. Although that may just be the TV I am watching movies on?Overall present went well and Dad loved the collection."
4,Old school trekkies enter the 21st century.,"Box set includes all the big screen movies that contained and focused on the original series cast. All the discs reproduce the movies in high definition clarity for video and 5.1 surround sound. You can tell the picture on the older movies came from older filming technology that isn't as sharp as today's cinematography standards, however even the older movies have been remastered to clean up and sharpen the image, making it worth having in high definition. Many movies include additional scenes which is another treat. As a Star Trek fan, I felt the quality and price are well suited for this product and worth my purchase. Amazon also beat all the local stores in price."
4,Excellent collection!,"This is a welcome addition to any Trekkie's collection!It is great to see some of the (quite) old movies being remastered and in full glory of HD!Definitely worth buying, especially if you can find it on sale."
5,great product,"This is a great product. Love it and am happy with the fast transaction, fast delivery. Thanks"
3,Star Trek Movie Collection Review,"Very nice collection and box setting, however, the set does not include the movie, ""Generations""."
5,Excellent for any Star Trek fan,"I picked this up when it was a daily deal, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellent collection to have and looks great."
4,No Director's Cut Here,"This set has decent Blu-Ray HD clarity, but if you are hoping the recent Director Cuts are found here - they are not. They are the original theatrical releases. The bonus footage is new and not recycled - some of it is even interesting if you are fan. If you are like my wife, you will yawn and fall asleep."
2,star trex the motion picture,"I was glad that I rented it first star trex before buying the whole set. The picture was fine but just as many of you had said they cut a few scenes. Why would paramont want to cut out a few scenes is it to save money I just dont understand there logic on this one. I have not seen the wrath of khan and the others, in blueray. thank god for netflix."
4,The Old Guys,It was good to get the original cast in Blu-ray. They look young compared to what they look like today. Good buy.
3,"Nice! But need HD version of ""The Motion Picture""","I agree with these reviews and will only get ""The Wrath of Khan"". Until they produce ""The Motion Picture' Director's Cut in Blu Ray I will not be getting it either. he sad part is ""The Motion Picture"" could be visually stunning in 1080p Blu Ray, but the Director's Cut would make it less ""boring"". Please Paramount .. .please release the HD version of ""The Motion Picture"" Director's Cut on Blu Ray!"
1,"No restoration, no extras = I'm not buying these again","As soon as the movies are all restored, with all the extras available, at a reasonable price (say $10-13 a movie in a large set) I will buy. Not until then. Fool me once...."
1,um. lame,"no restoration? are they kidding? why, so they can release the restored versions in a year and double up on the revenues?lame."
5,star trek movie collect,I found the Star trek movie collection to be a fantastic buy. They have done a very fine job with the transfer to blu ray. This collection looked 200 times better than I thought it would. Great product.
2,No Director's Cuts? = No Sale!,"So let me get this straight.... Paramount releases the box-set only to leave out the Director's Cuts of the films? Sorry! No sale here.This is another crude attempt at double-dipping the customer. For those of you that don't know, Paramount releases these ""bare-bones"" versions only to release the DC's a year or so later forcing you to buy those when you actually wanted them to begin with.Sorry Paramount. You lose."
4,Star Trek original movies on blu-ray,"I liked the set, with on exception. The directors cut of the motion picture should have been included in the set or made the default. I also liked the extras."
3,Good but not nearly as good as TNG,"The video in TOS is good but the audio has much to be desired. If you want a really good collection of a Star Trek Series, I would recommend TNG series as the picture and sound are perfect. This is mainly due to the technology that was available at the time of filming these two series. It's a definite must for the die hard Trekkie fans out there! I personally own all of the Star Trek Series in Blu Ray and would like to share my opinion with everyone else - Amazon has thye best5 deals on blu rays in the world!"
1,Not Blu-Ray Quality,"The movies are great ... this transfer to blu-ray is not. It is a shame to even call these Star Trek movies on blu-ray because they have not been enhanced to match the high-def quailty blu-ray provides. Save your money ... or better yet ... buy the First Season of the original Star Trek series on blu-ray. The entire season is enhanced, even the music re-recorded, graphics enhanced ... a true work of art restoring the entire season. Whatever ""bean counter"" executive decided to release these Star Trek movies WITHOUT enhancing the films to match the enhanced technology of blu-ray should be fired. Releasing these great films to look ordinary on an extrordinary format shows no understanding of sci-fi, technology or the fan base. ...and by the way ... even the packaging is cheap and began falling apart the day after I got it."
3,missing w double,i orderd myself the blu ray disc STAR TREK ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE COLLECTION INCLUDING SIX THEATRICAL FILMS PLUS A SEVENTH BONUS DISC THE CAPTAINS SUMMIT. THIS PACKAGE IS MISSING STARTREK THE MOTION PICTURE#1 AND HAS TWO COPYS OF THE FINAL FRONTIER. THIS SEEMS TO BE A NICE SET OF MOVIES I JUST WISH THAT I HAD THEM ALL
4,Star Trek movies enjoyed with great clarity,"These blu-ray discs offer a really great way to enjoy the first six Star Trek films. The picture is beautiful and the sound is exceptional. There are many bonus features about the making of the films and their history. However, I would have liked an extended edition of the first film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and later editions of others and wondered why at least some of them were not included in the set. True, I enjoy seeing movies shown as they were shown the first time in the theater, but if a later version of the film is made, and it is better and sometimes longer, it seems that it should be offered with the most modern technology. But this set is well worth your money for the vast improvement of picture and sound if you previously owned the VHS tapes and DVD's. You will be very pleased with this new look of these now classic films."
4,Captains' summit-thumbs down,I'd give it 5 stars except I found the Captains' Summit DVD so lame - did they really need a 7th DVD in the set? what for? to jack up the price!!!
4,Star Trek Collection,What can you say about Star Trek? The show was beyond its time from the very first episode and the subsequent movies have made it that much better. The concept evolved over time and seeing all the movies in chronological order helps the viewer to better understand the evolution of the Star Trek saga. The picture and quality of this set is very good. Definitely something every Trekie should own.
3,Something is missing...,"I bought this set for my husband for Christmas. While we both enjoyed the boxed set, we both noticed into the first movie that several scenes were missing, and noticed into the following movies that scenes were from all the others as well. I am not sure why those scenes were deleted from the set, but they were missed and I wish I had done a little more research before purchasing them."
1,I'll wait too!,"I love Star Trek and the original movies, and I too will not buy this until they restore it properly. If only one movie is Blu Ray, it doesn't warrant the price tag."
1,Don't dump to disk,I'm rating this one start because I hate when studios don't spend the time and money for a proper release. Star Trek is one of those franchises that has been especially abused on DVD. Releasing a blu-ray set with only one one of the films actually in high definition is disgraceful. Give the fans some respect and put the time and effort into quality products!!
2,What happened to the reviews?,"I could have sworn that when I examined this title earlier in may, there were about 400 ""1 star"" reviews, but now only 40. What happened??????"
1,Blu Ray STANDARD DEFINITION Box Set plus one HD title!!!,"The Box Says it all ... ""Over 2-1/2 Hours of ALL-NEW special Features Plus over 12 HOURS of PREVIOUSLY RELEASED CONTENT*"" Now you have to read the fine print at the Bottom of the box with the Asterisk ...""*Previously released content is presented in STANDARD DEFINITION""Amazon should be posting this fine print in there description.People who purchased Blu-Ray players did so to watch High Definition Content. If we wanted standard definition content there would be no need for Blu-Ray players! Paramount Studios tried to pull a fast one on us suckers who purchased this box set. Thank God for Amazon's return policy!This is one guy who will not be suckered by Paramount's underhanded practices!!!"
1,Count me out...,"The price would be freakin' sweet...WERE ALL THE DISCS IN HI-DEF, and not JUST ONE???? I only want I and II and after Paramount raped us with this current film, no double-dipping from me. Ever."
5,"Got it, Awesome set. Very pleased.","This is a review from someone who actually owns this set. I've watched all 6 movies and the bonus disc. I think these movies look GREAT on Blu ray. A HUGE step up from the dvd set that I also own. The motion picture has never looked so good. This is the oldest of the films and I am very impressed with how good it looks. They all look great.As far as too much DNR and people looking waxy. Well, they have a ton of make up caked on there faces. These are not the youngest of actors in these movies. People need to know the differance. I still see facial detail, clothing, etc.Also, people commented on things being out of focus, not sharp. I think the cameras used have a very short focus length. So if someone is not the focus of a scene, they are not in focus. This has nothing to do with the restoration, it was how it was filmed originally.Over all I am VERY happy with this set and it is a GREAT deal! Well worth the money."
3,Be forewarned,"This set contains the original theatrical release the first six Star Trek movies. In the case of Star Trek's 1, 2, and 6 this means that certain scenes are missing that were present in the ""Director's edition"" or ""special collector's edition"" previously released on DVD. Except for 1, the missing scenes are not included even as bonus features. The ""Operation Retrieve"" that was (in)famously removed from the theatrical cut is missing, as is the ""this is not Klingon blood"" and the unmasking of Colonel West scene. In 2, the scenes that reference Peter Preston being Scotty's nephew are gone. The least they could have done was include the scenes as deleted scene bonus features. They advertise having the ""original, theatrical versions"" as if it's a good thing, but it feels like something's missing. Paramount, give people what they actually want, not what you think they should have.As for the rest, the Blu-ray quality isn't even that good on some of the movies."
4,Star Trek The Movies Blu-ray,"The movies played well and it was interesting to see the the old technology compared to Star War or Transformers movies. Service was good, I ordered and it was delivered the next day. We took the set with us on vacation. Watched them all. It rained.olmstead3"
1,Rip off,After waiting what seemed like 2 wks for this item to ship I finally receiving it. It was not wrapped in the factory plastic and was missing three out of the seven disc's. I was sooo pissed... this item did not say anywhere that it was used or 2nd hand. One would think they would check the discs before shipping....Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection (The Motion Picture / The Wrath of Kahn / The Search for Spock / The Voyage Home / The Final Frontier / The ... Captains Summit Bonus Disc) [Blu-ray]Very Disappointed in the product arrival.
5,Star Trek is back,"What can you say, if you like Star Trek this is the best way to see it if you don't own your own theater. The picture quality is superb. The extra disc is just more good stuff."
5,Has great humor inside stories,If you like Star Trek this collection is great and quality of picture is wonderful. The originals have more humor than the Next Generation collection.
4,I Love Classic Trek,"The item shipped very quickly, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this item to a friend."
4,Excellent,"Good condition when received, very enjoyable movies. Just like I saw them in the theater, sound is amazing and picture is great."
2,7.1 only comes through 2 speakers of my 5.1 system,"First off, this would have been a great blu-ray edition had it not been converted to 7.1, not everyone can afford to buy a 7.1 receiver and speakers. I find it infuriating it does not even support a 5.1 system. There is no reason for this I have no trouble playing other blu rays through all 6 channels which is the purpose of a 5.1 system, why is it Star Trek ONLY supports 7.1 in the english language?!"
5,Star Trek better than ever,"If you care about visual treats on classic films, this set is for you. The blu-ray version is stunning and well worth a look. Also, the extras are quirky and entertaining. If you are a Trek fan, you can't miss out on this spectacular package. Very recommended!"
2,"This Box Set Is Great, But One Problem I Have An Issue With...","I was watch Search For Spock the third Star Trek and when it reached 1 hour 08 minutes 17 seconds, it starts freezing up and starts playing again repeatedly. There is definitly wrong with this blu ray disc like if it was some dvd disc. I just don't understand why it does that. Does anybody have an answer to this problem? I did everything I could to fix it like wiping the disc with a soft cloth and blowing it but nothing helps. I would've given it a five star, but the disc is the issue and I wanna return this product back. So far I only saw Star Trek 1 & 2, but the third didn't do so well. The pictures of these films I saw were great but only if I could watch the third movie without any freeze ups then I would be really happy with the set. I just hope iv, v and vi isn't like the third one."
4,Origianl Star Trek Movies- nothing special,I recently replaced the majority of my parents star trek collection which were on vhs. The movies are there and good quality.
2,Missing,I just received this blue ray series of the first movies and star trek #3 the search for Spock is not here. All the other ones are here but #3 how can I get there movie that was to be in the series?????
5,star trek,"If you like star trek, this is a great item. we watched one after the other. it's a great series"
5,star trek fan,"I love star trek been a fan since i was a kid thanks to the seller to have them on disc. My family is a convert also. So star trek rocks after 30 years. In the words of the immortal Mr Spock ""Live Long and Prosper""."
1,An excessively degrained and filtered travesty,"The German edition of this product has already been released last week. As this is an international Paramount release, I presume the quality will be the same as the US product.All films are HEAVILY degrained and DNRd (high frequency filtering/""noise reduction""). Almost every fine detail is lost due to this heavy digital processing. Faces look like wax figures from Madame Tussaud's.The transfers seem to be based on the 2001 remasters. In addition to that, Star Trek IV, V and VI seem to be old interlaced transfers derived from old 1080i transfers. The degraining on these films is even more obvious and very annoying.Sorry to say, Paramount, but this is a pure TRAVESTY."
3,Great Movies - Package badly damaged in shipping!,Classic Sci-Fi. Just wish my box wasn't destroyed when they shipped it from Amazon! They didn't put in enough packing material. Poorly done.
3,Not as hard as I would have liked,"I took a chance on buying some of these envelopes. I was hoping for a very firm envelope that could double as a frame on the wall. These envelopes would not be suitable for that type of use because they are too thin and wobbly. I have always been a fan of Itoya's products, but this one was a let down to me. I will still use it to store some of my Mondo poster collection, but I will need to seek additional framing long term. Only buy this for long term flat storage purposes, not for a wall hanging."
2,Read Kundera Instead,"Although I enjoyed this book, I found it strikingly unoriginal. Klima covers many of the themes found in other Czech literature written during the rule of the communist regime: love, hate, body, soul, oppression, and freedom. If one is interested in exploring such themes, Milan Kundera's 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' is a much better choice than this particular work. Given that 'Love and Garbage' is Klima's response to Kundera's 'Unbearable Lightness...' I find it difficult to see how one could fully understand this book without first having read Kundera's novel. When one reads both books, one immediately notices the marked difference between the two authors: simply put, Kundera is better."
1,"Forget the Love, Garbage","This was chosen as a book for my book club. If it hadn't been, I would not have stuggled through the entire thing. It reminded me of times in school when I kept checking how many pages I had left to go to finish an assignment. The book is very depressing and I could find very little value in it. Of the three people in my book club who finished it (out of 17), no one liked it. (This is a fairly sophisticated and educated group.) I realize that the author is well-recognized and that this is supposed to be ""art"" but that did not help my overall impression."
1,Not suited for LLC's that use 1040 forms,"Box says good for LLC but it does not include any 1040 forms that many LLC's submit for tax purposes, you must buy another software program from them to get the 1040 tax forms.A Better value is the TaxCut software from H&R; Block."
2,Lost Data Problem,"I purchased this product from Amazon. After spending probably 15 hours of work entering information, I returned to my computer today to find that the only information remaining in the tax file was my corporate name and address information. All income, expenses, deductions and depreciation entries were gone.I've had no problems with my system and no failures so I'm at a loss on what happened to all of my work. I regularly saved a fresh copy and the program itself requires that.The only thing I did other than work on the return was to file an extension, so maybe it has something to do with that, but I don't know what...Be very careful, there are other reports on the Turbo Tax Forum of users losing their data, even after filing their returns for this year!"
3,Don't ask questions,"This is a ""no brainer"" program. As long as you follow the interview you can get through it. But They don't always ask the questions you need and if you find you've left something out it can take all night trying to figure out how to get the information onto your tax form. It's sometimes difficult to find the information you need. But it beats the heck out of trying to understand the IRS instructions."
4,A Builders Guide to Floors,"An elmentary but complete guide to the flooring industry. Covers all the main type of fooring; carpet, hard surfaces, ceramic tiles, laminates and wood. Goes into quite a lot o detial on installation techniques, equipment requires etc.A suitable guide for the buider or contractor not so much for somebody who wants a industry guide."
3,Good biography but technical,"I use this biography in my fourth grade classroom. It does a good job of characterizing Orville and Wilbur Wright -- you get a true sense of their determination and perfectionism. However, some of the information is very technical which tends to confuse my children. In the end, my students have mixed feelings about the book - some enjoy it immensely while others complain that it is hard to read."
1,If I could rate any lower I would.,"I bought this as a gift for my mother and to my surprise the container was empty! not even 1/4 of the way full. And to my luck the product cannot be returned, future customers beware. This may be just a coincidence but keep it in mind when purchasing."
5,"Bought on a Whim-Love, Love, Love",Always liked Liz Claiborne so I bought on a whim to try out. Love it...the perfect day time scent. Light and lovely and Lasts from 8am to 5pm. Quick Delivery
2,Not a favorite,"Not a bad smelling fragrance, but it does not really have anything to recommend it. I think it is a fragrance for a young teenager."
2,Don't like.,"I bought this a little while ago and did not like it. The smell reminds me of a certain cleaning product....MR. CLEAN. Don't get me wrong I love Mr. Clean, but he is for my home only."
5,Mop system,I love this system. The two mop pads are a great help. If one gets clean I use the other while the first awaits a trip to the washer.
4,Simplee Cleen Mop,Purchased the Simplee Cleen Mop to use on our newly installed laminate floors. We love it...It picks up dust easily and is easy to clean
5,love it!,"i was looking for a replacement for my swiffer jetset. i didn't like my swiffer jet because every once in a while my househeepper would leave the bottle attched and it would leak in my closet, secondly i hated the idea of having to replace batteries and lastly i didn't think the pads were that great.love this product! first, it much larger than the swiffer and covers more surface area. the pole is adjustable, which i think is a great feature, esp for hard to reach places. the wet pad rocks. it doesn't get soppy wet and one pad was enough to clean my whole apartment - kitchen, office, living room, hall way, and 2 small bedrooms.i've washed the pad and let it air dry. so far its been great!"
5,GREAT...Love this....,GREAT...Love this....Simplee Cleen Microfiber Swivel Household Mop Kit with Two Pads....Works better than anything else I have ever used. Love that it has two pads and and the pole is adjustable.... Very Happy
5,Perfect!,"I have saltillo tile floors throughout the house that I struggle to keep clean. Brooms just move the dust and pet hair around. I can sweep the same spot multiple times without success. And my vacuum cleaner, even on a bare floor setting, throws around debris more than it picks up. But this mop grabs everything in just one stroke. The head pivots and swivels in such a way that I have no problem getting into corners and along baseboards. With the pads on, the entire head is only one inch thick, which allows me to reach under furniture with very low clearance, like my grandfather clock. Getting under couches and beds is even easier... I no longer need to scoot them around.And rather than toss the heads in the washer, I simply vacuum them clean. I haven't had them long enough to comment on their durability. Also, I haven't tried using one with a floor cleaning solution. I happy enough with how well they work dry."
5,GREAT - A MUST HAVE!!!,"This little book (and I mean little in size - not content) is wonderful. Small enough to fit anywhere. The patterns have a good selection. Fancy socks, baby socks, plain socks and really funky socks. This book is written in simple to understand instructions and really inspires you to make socks. A must have for any sock knitter!"
5,A must have in any dream research!,"I found this book to contain an element lacking in other dream interpretation guidebooks. It allows for latitude in personal interpretation which is essential to accurate dream interpretation. Unlike other books of this kind the author gives several possible meanings, allowing the reader to determine which definition is applicable in her or his life."
4,Interesting,"I have a few symbolic and dream dictionaries to break down my dreams that can be very itemized. It's nice to get to understand what my dreams have meant. The book is yellowed around the edges, like it's been sitting on a shelf for a long time, but in the end, I get my answers."
4,Very helpful,One of the best books for dream interpretation I've found. I've read several other books and this is definitely my pick for dream books.
5,Awesome Toy!,"I got this rocket for my son's 9th birthday and he LOVES it!! He wants to be an astronaut, so loves anything space-related, but even so with all the space toys he has, he says this is his all-time favorite.I was really impressed with the little booklet that comes along with the rocket that explains how the Saturn V was used during the Apollo mission. Our living room has been transformed into a lunar landing base and the three little plastic astronauts in the orbiter have flown miles and miles and miles around our couch!It is not a toy for a little kid that wants a rocket to throw around outside - the stages are meant to be put together and taken apart but probably wouldn't stand up to very rough play. However, for a kid with a little more patience that truly wants to use their imagination to reenact a realistic moon mission, it is the best."
2,Niice but not great !,"This is a nice toy makes sounds and all, but that is it.. My youngster got sick of it pretty fast. Also the lunar module did not stay on the rocket properly kept falling off. For the price I Think it is not worth it.... Way toooo expensive. Buy a Model Saturn V rocket from a hobby shop and have the child build it with you. That is more fun. more educational."
3,Fun but a litte flimsy,"I read a lot of reviews before I buy things this was no exception. It's a neat toy we bought it for our 3 1/2 year old and yes we knew it's a little advanced for him. I will say there are a lot of parts and it doesn't stay together very well. It's neat the blast off noises but a big complaint was first day we got it the ""USA"" red markings on the rocket were all rubbing off?? It's not the best made toy but like I said it is pretty neat and if you have a rocket lover it's a good toy."
3,A boy's toy without consideration of owner,"Pro's:1. It's big, give my son wow when he received in at Christmas;2. You can dessemble it, and check parts one by one, then assemble it again;Con's:1. It is not designed for boys because it is so easy to break;2. Details, very cheap;"
3,great Rocket - but very flimsy,"My three year old loves space and rockets and was so thrilled to get the Saturn 5 Rocket with the all the Apollo bits. He plays with it for hours. It is just such a shame that the third stage ( the part that opens to release the lunar lander) is so flimsy and fragile. He gets so frustrated when the doors keep falling off. We have resorted to taping the doors in place which rather defeats the point of the toy! I suppose this is really more of a model that a toy, which is a great shame as this is a very realistic rocket and lunar module."
3,Looks great but build is not good.,"The saturn v rocket looks great and my 4y old son loves it. However, it is very poorly designed: the different stages are very hard to separate or put together even for an able adult, and at the same time the service module attachment to the 3rd stage is very FRAGILE. Needs to be redesigned."
4,Our boys love it,"Our boys, 6 & 4, just love the rocket and play with it a lot. The stages are too hard for them to put together, so Dad has to help out now and then. Very impressive toy, looks great standing in their room, good detail."
5,excellent product,I have used this product for some time now with no trouble. Installation is automatic. This hub is self-powered which means it comes with its own power supply; this is good because it does not make your computer supply the power via the usb cable. Product is small and sturdy. Hub can also be stacked on top of others of the same brand.
2,Don't try this on a mac.,"Do not try to install this port on an iMac-this port is intended for PC's despite the claim that it is mac compatible. Instead, look for the Mac version of this Entrega product (search mac USB). P.S. It would be nice for Amazon to bring the MAC version up as an initial choice when searching for USB ports."
2,Gillan's voice is terrible,"This is such a fun and talented band to watch, but you just never know if you're going to get a decent Ian Gillan performance or a terrible one. Unfortunately, this release is the latter, which is a shame because I've actually seen a few shows where his singing was really strong compared to his usual decent performance. Once one of the golden throats of rock, he just didn't take care of himself like contemporaries like Glenn Hughes, and sadly, it shows. When he sings the classics, it sounds like a different vocalist. Again, musically, Deep Purple are one of the best live bands still playing, but I'd pass on this particular performance."
4,Deep Purple Still Rock,"A must have for the Deep Purple fan,old or new. I'm glad I got this, I recommend this highly. Good extras of the band."
2,Deep Grey instead of purple,"Being a long time rock fan, I looked forward to seeing one of my favorite groups in the historic Montreux setting. However, I was really disappointed in the Ian Gillan vocals or lack thereof. He sounded strained and even forgot the words in Highway Star. Any DVD or recording that has Steve Morse in it has redeeming qualities, as he is one of the true treasures of the guitar and continues to channel creativity and musicality at every turn. remainder of the band was competent and tight and the audio and video quality was as good as expected from Blu Ray format, but I couldnt get past the poor imitation of himself done by Ian."
5,"Deep Purple, concert","Like always Deep Purple, Live very impressive. Sound good but 7.1 missing again. Overall very good concert."
5,finally something that goes that isn't so girly!,"first- we love this pattern. my 7 yr old wants to use this to coordinate with all her yellow submarine collectibles (she's very cool), I'd tried to convince her to le tme use this in the bathroom and we'd do something a little more girly in her room and she wouldn't have it. so we're doing both. her little brothers share the bathroom and it's so hard to find stuff suitable for them all.second- to the guest from nashville- why didn't you just use the clear curtain the way it was intended? wouldn't it have been a lot easier? I hang 2 bars in our kids bath so that I can pull back the decorative curtain yet still be able to keep an eye on the kids while protecting the rest of the room from splashing- but if thats not a concern you can put both curtains on the same hooks. I'm not trying to be sarcastic or harsh- I guess it could be difficult to see thru the clear panel with all that clear liner in the way....."
5,i need a bed spread!,I just re-did my room and got this striped shower curtain and I love it! The only problem I have is I need a bed spread to go with it. I am painting my room red and this is the only shower curtain I found that I actually like but I really need a bed spread to match it!! If you see any bed spreads to match this shower curtain please e-mail me at wave10soccer@yahoo.com!If you sell the material or see it any where let me know.Please e-mail me I really really like this shower curtin but all I need now is a bed spred to match it!
2,Beware Plastic Clips,"This is the first wiper blade that I have ever broken. The plastic clips on this wiper that hold it to the car's wiper arm are very prone to failure in cold weather. Mine snapped at zero degrees for no apparent reason. Replacement blade is working fine and the blade on the passenger side (smaller at 18"") shows no sign of failure."
4,Great wiper,We purchased this wipers for our Trail Blazer. These wipers work better than normal or winter wipers on the curved windshield. In a freezing rain storm we had less build up than any other car on the highway. Not zero but less.They also work well in the rain. I would recommend them for any vehicle.
4,Good Product,So far it performs better than traditional products. Windshield is clearer. At least the wiper looks cool.
3,I Have Doubts,"Ok...we haven't seen Kirby in quite a while and it is pretty cool seeing our pink inflatable hero eating his was back into action. But, I don't think this game is going to live up to its hype. I've played a game that has a similair layout and was very dissappointed. Kirby will most likely be much better on the Gamecube."
2,Very disapointing,"I 'm sorry, but this game was one of the worst games I have ever played. You just start the game by going through levels using the powers, but your not as aggressive like in Kirbys Super Star, now that was a game! Every time you get hit, you lose your power! It is mad annoying. The story of the game isn't explained until you beat it which doesn't take long at all if your good at adventure games. This was a poor excuse for a Kirby game. There was no story and Kirby's powers weren't the same and cool as Kirbys Super Star. So I don't reccomend this game, I had to find out the hard way how bad it is."
3,fun while it lasts,"Kirby is one of the few title where you can say, with full confidence and sanity ""i just kicked a whole army's ass with a pink, puffy,.....thing!"" nightmare in dreamland is definately not the kirby for the ages. The game itself is classic kirby fun, witha few new added morphs. unfortunately, the storyline is sketchy and hard to follow, and the game is extremely short and easy. i personally put abot two of my gaming hours into this game, which is a meer drop compared tot he 37 hours i have saved to my final fantasy X file. Also, once you ahve run through the game, there really is no reason to do so a second time, because there are NO unlockables waht so ever. Don't get me wrong, the gmeplay of this game is still good fun, but if you have a super nintendo, you will find much more entertainment in kirby superstar."
5,IT REALLY IS A DREAM!!!!!,"This game is the best game for GBA I have ever played in my life! You're missing out on everything if you love GBA. It's really a good game. My sister traded me this game. Boy, is she crazy!"
4,Kirby rocks!!!,Kirby is a fun expierence. There are sub games I made it to level 6 right away.You have to fight monsters. I recommend this game. It was my brothers but I play it all the time!!! Im 7 years old and its good for my age
5,This game is so much fun,"Trying to beat some of the bosses as you get up to higher levels can get pretty annoying and frustrating, but this game is tons of fun."
4,"Short, but fun","Kirby Nightmare in Dreamland is a remake of the original Kirby's Adventure, but there are a few new things about the game. Once you beat the game with Kirby 100% you get to play as Meta Knight in a game called Meta Knightmare. Other than that, there are no other major additions, but it's still a great game. I rate this game 81/100."
2,This game RULES!!!!!!,"Sure, Kirby might be a pink ball who looks pretty cuddly, but in Nightmare in Dreamland, he is a mean, Nightmare-beating, enemy-sucking, power-stealing ball! With 8 levels of hard play and fun mini-games, Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland is a must-have for all Nintendo and Kirby fans!! Kirby RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,NID is the best game in the world,"Kirby is back, and better than ever!!! With tons of attacks and surprises for you!!! If you don't have it then GET IT!!! Also you can link up with your friends for more fun for all!!! The only cons are price and length of gameplay."
2,sure is a nightmare.... :(,"I knew this game wasnt worth table scraps and I was right. The game is way too short!The bosses are too easy, and the ability to have combination copies is nowhere to be found. The only credit I could give this game is the nice graphics. Evrything in it doesnt even come close 2 Kirby: Crystal Shards. I'd recommend Kirby: NiD for kids 7 and under...."
4,fun game but doesnt last long,Yes this game is very fun i got it yesterday and i alrdy beat it so if u play gameboy advance alot i wouldn't suggest this game u will beat it within hours.
5,Short but fun,"Well this game is a little short but a lot fun.Graphics: 10/10 very good graphics, kirby looks very goodGame play: 9/10 you can have a lot of fun playing this game but you can't decide where to saveControl: 10/10 very easy to controlDurability: 5/10 the game is very shortReally if you buy this game is not a waste of money and you will like it, kirby looks good and there are a lot of enemies and bosses (some are easy to beat)and you also have some extras during the game (like museum and sub-games). Also the sub games are very cool you have 4 mini games and you can play with your friends but 1 pack, in adventure mode you can play with a friend wich is very good, but who have the original Kirby game for NES is a remake of it so dont waste your money in the other hand people that are starting with a kirby game is a good choice."
3,Cute but a little too lite,"This is a remake of Kirby's Adventure, a game released fairly late in the NES' life. Although Nightmare in Dream Land is pleasant enough, it does suffer from two large problems. The first is the graphics. Many of the backdrops look like grainy, blurry desktop wallpapers. This is kind of ugly, and it clashes with the sprites. The second problem is the stage design, which can be too easy-breezy. It is not good when players can fly over most obstacles in a stage without at least some aerial resistance!Nightmare in Dream Land is very short. I finished it on a Sunday afternoon. The final boss is nice as heck. If you are looking for another GBA Kirby game, Kirby & the Amazing Mirror has much better level design, but it retains the unattractive backgrounds and has an unhelpful map. Still, I would recommend it over NiDL."
4,An excellent game.One of the best on the Game Boy Advance.,This game is a lot of fun. Its the sequel to Kirby 64 which was one of the best games on the Nintendo 64.All platform style Kirby games are really similar but that doesnt really take away from how fun they are.The graphics are great and the music is pleasant and Kirby is one of the best heroes in video game history.This is one of those games that you can play again and again and not get sick of.Now for the pros and cons-Pros: One of the most fun games availableGood graphics and soundKirby can copy enemies abilitiesRanks up there with Super Mario World andthe Sonic Advance gamesCons: May be a little too simple and easy for moreexperienced gamersCuteness may be a turn off for some peopleAll the Kirby platform games are very similarIn conclusion the good outweighs the bad for me and people like me although more experienced gamers might want to stick to games like Zelda and Metroid.
5,Good for any Kirby fan!,"I've been a Kirby fan scince the Anime came out. I loved it, and after I saw it I wanted to get all the games. That's when I noticed that Kirby's Adventure was for NES, and my brothers sold the one I had years ago. When I heard this game was a remake of that one, I was VERY exited! I got it for Christmas eve, and beat Nightmare on Christmas morning. After playing for a while, I got 100%, and unlocked Extra. Normal was easy, but EXTRA... You only have 3 HP! It took me over two hours to beat Nightmare! I'm not telling you what I got after beating that, but let me tell you this: IT WAS WORTH IT! I say EVERY Kirby fan should own a copy of this game!"
4,THE BEST GAME YOU SHOULD OWN IT!!!!,I think this is one of the best games it is so much fun and i never get board of it its not to easy but not to hard its perfect it is challenging someimes but it makes the game more fun and intresting if you like kirby games you should get this the graphics are great the sound is great i would give it 100 out of 100
4,"The funest, coolest, not boring challenging game EVER !!!!","Kirby is a relly fun game you can suck up your enemies and spit them back out, or take over there powers over. i bought this game after Christmas. For me i have other stuff to do and i didnt beat it yet. But this game is pretty challenging though but at the same time easy."
1,pros & cons,The story is horrible and the game is too easy. I beat the final boss in 3 tries. and i beat dedede only using the laser powerupPro:Easy to controllCon:Too easy
1,not as good as i thought.....,"this is definetly not worth your money. this game should be classified under ""kids games"".this in not even challenging. it's not even really fun either. there are so many short stages( about 6) in each level,and you only spend about 15 seconds in each stage.they should have spent more time making the stages longer and more difficult,instead of having a bunch of short easy levels that waste your time and aren't even worth picking up your GBA.this is a boring and money wasting game. don't let the cute pink guy convince you it's a good game. have you ever heard ""don't judge a book by it's cover""well all i say is don't judge this game by it's case."
1,A port that seems all wrong!!!,"What were they thinking, porting one of the Greatest NES games of all-time Kirby's Adventure to the GBA!!! The music is wrong, the sounds are wrong, The gameplay is wrong, and the difficulty is easier! It coundn't have gotten worse than this. If your gonna make a port atleast leave the game as it was and try to get the name right or it will ruin the game for everyone!!! They shoud have came out with a totally new Kirby game for the GBA and brought this one to the GC in mayby something like a Kirby Collectors addition with games such as: Kirby's Dreamland 1,2,and 3, Kirby's Adventure,Kirby Super Star, Kirb:The crystal Shards, and more!!! Now that is a great idea!"
4,"Great Game, but not as good as it looks...","I picked up this game a couple of weeks ago and it had many great new things in it including new and different powers, sub-games, power museums in the each world, and possible multiplayer. The only problem that I saw was that the game was unexpectedly short. The game only has 8 worlds (excluding the final boss) each with 5 levels, a couple of sub games and the boss of the level. It took me about 2 days to complete the game and move onto another game. I may not be a very smart man, but I do know the difference between too long, normal, and too short. Otherwise the game is easy enough for a 3 year old to understand. I would recommend it to any Kirby lover!"
4,A bit on the easy side.,"This is an extraordinary game on the game boy advanced. Although it is a re-make of the Nintendo game, it has stunning graphics and vivacious colors. The game play is fun, simple and addictive. The controls, well, the controls are great and easy to master. I give this game an 9.333 out of 10.0. I recommend it for anyone from 6 to 60 years old."
4,"Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland, Rated by an 11 year old.","I think this game is very fun, and much better than the classic version. There are more transformations for Kirby to use. The gameplay is great, considering the more sophisticated games I play. Though if you play this game a lot, it feels really short (I finished in in about 3 days :P). The bosses at the end of each world start out easy, but they get really really REALLY hard. This game has mini-games too. They are fun, and there are 3 plus one called ???? ?????????. Well, I won't give you the name of it, BUY THE GAME TO FIND OUT!!!"
4,AWESOME game to play on the Game Boy Advance,"Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land is a AWESOME game to play on the Game Boy Advance game systemI give it 5 Stars ""Highly Recommended"" REALLY TOTAL WORTH IT TO BUY & PLAY this game on your Game Boy AdvanceREALLY TOTAL WORTH IT TO GET THIS GAME AND PLAY IT FOR YOUR SELF ( this is must have game to get)"
5,Kirby Nightmare In Dreamland rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-CBH,"kirby nightmare in dreamland is an excellent gaming experience thats worth every penny you pay. Kirby has 24 different forms he can turn into. Tornado, wheel, sword, and laser just to name a few. The best things about the newest addition to the kirby series are the gameplay, graphics, and fitness. When I say fitness I mean that this has absolutely not one bad thing in it. That's why I rate it E for everyone. The only bad thing about it is how short it is. It took me only one night to beat half the game! The multiplayer stuff is awesome, and you only need one game and a hookup cord to play with two people.(As long as you have two GBA.) In my opinion, this is the best game out right now for the GBA."
5,Read,You know I've played A LOT of games but... this is probably the best game boy game in history. Others may disagree but I got this game 4 months ago and I still continue to play this.Out of 5Education:3Fun:5Action:5Graphics:6(yeah amazing graphics)Overall:Out of 10 9.99
2,The Jesus of History and the Christ of Faith.,I was very disappointed by this book. The title promised a scholarly account of the historical Jesus and of the evolution of Christian thought. Instead the book turned out to be a coffee-table style publication with pshort passages of text brokn up by pictures and bullet inserts after the manner of a popular encyclopaedia. The text itself read like an impersonal and superficial assemblage of facts - as if hoovered up by a machine.I had ordered this book in response to a bright young student who had shown an interest in researching the historical Jesus - and all that followed. But there was no way that I would insult him or hope to interest him by giving him this book to read.
2,Where's the science?,"Fast paced but where's the science. Elite light infantry combat with rifles and grenades. So far so good. But, nothing heavy, like a mortar? Artillery? Oops, left em orbit. The good guys are great and the bad guys are evil cardboard cut outs with no attempt to explain why they do anything they do. Good action, crummy story."
1,What a piece of JUNK,"Purchased 2 of these as part of a larger installation package for a Viper 5902 system going into my 2007 Toyota 4Runner. Had a certified/reputable local stereo shop do the installation (not a big chain electronics store, but a small boutique store with an experienced installer who's been doing installs for 20+ years). Just about 1 year out, 1 module dies. Now, a little under 2 years out, the other module is starting to malfunction.I've also had the backup siren from DEI go bad as well, about 1 year out.I learned my lesson the hard way--and won't be going with any DEI product (Viper, etc...) again. Their stuff is made-in-China cheap, and you could probably source electronics from Harbor Freight Tools that would last longer. I'm very disappointed in the price I paid for the quality of their components!"
3,Works but not in my 07 Chrysler 300,"Installed this module in my 2007 Chrysler 300 Touring, and after intallation along with the Viper 5901 it worked fine except after arming the car windows roll up but as soon as it hits the top they roll down..."
2,Its not that good,"I installed that with viper 5902, from best buy they charge me $100 extra to install just this, which is twice the price of this product. It roll up the windows when you armed, but it never roll windows downward properly you have to press again and again to roll down"
2,Not for newer vehicles w/o alarm systems,"No issue with the product or the seller. Shipped on time. If you have a 2008 or newer vehicle and want one-touch-up power windows w/o an alarm, then this is not the right module. When I talked to a professional installer, they could not guarantee the one-touch at the switch would work (even with an alarm)."
2,Not Grahams best,Graham has a great idea behind how the photographs are presented but in the end the statement comes out a little flat and simplistic...and this is if you have the stamina to wade through what seems like a bloated edit. The middle photographs are beautiful however and really quite nice on their own as weird street photographs.
5,Great product,"I bought this lens to take photos at Ironman Louisville. The photos came out great. While shooting during the bike portion of the event, I set my camera (a Nikon D50) to manual mode and shot in the continuous mode. The lens accomodated quickly and I had no issues with focusing. I went with this model for the VR offered, and I'm glad I spent the extra money."
5,Sweet Lens,"I love this lens for my Nikon D3100. The 55-200mm lens is great for portraits, pet photography, etc. The lens is easy to use and has worked flawlessly for me. I keep this lens on my camera in my case. I only change out to my 18-55mm kit lens of 35mm fixed lens when I have a specific purpose for it. The 55-200mm is my go to lens in most situations. It really allows the background to be blurred and the subject to stand out in sharp focus. Buy it. Use it. Love it."
3,Do not buy a used lens,"I was a litter disappointed when I receive this lens, scratch all over the bottom of the lens which means the pre-owner of this lens use it a lot. I can not complain it because it is a used lens and $100 cheaper than the new one. When I put it on my nikon d7000 and taking a few photos, I found the lens does not focus on the place that I want it to be. even if I adjust the focus manually, the lens does not focus on the center area of the viewfinder. Do not buy a used lens. hope this review might helps you ."
4,cheap quality lens. makes a little noise on the focus though,"i bought mine at a pawn shop for $100 and it works great for what i need, i had my standard kit lens from my d3000 and needed an upgrade. i am in no way a professional photographer. but if you are looking for a step up from a kit lens you own this is a great place to start.i bought this since i am going to new york next week and need a larger lens than my 18-55mm. so far it has been an okay lens although it does make some noise focusing if you shoot in auto. sometimes it also has trouble focusing but this could be because i have bought a used one, and the previous owner may not have cared for it correctly.this is a great lens but i wouldnt have spent $250 on it but getting it used for $100 is a steal and it came with a bag and hood.one more thing, the glass quality is very poor for a lens but you are getting what you pay for in this situation."
3,"VR is sweet, but lens is painfully slow","If I had to do it over again, I'd probably save for the longer, faster VR lens."
2,Okay for Expediency,"As long as you view the photographs under 100% magnification, it's okay. But at all focal lengths from 55mm to 200mm, it's soft. If I were Nikon, I'd be ashamed to put my label on it. But because it's so lightweight and inexpensive, I could see this lens being used for quick, utilitarian use that does not require much technical prowess from the lens. This would be a good lens for children and students in order to get acquainted with digital photography.What are the alternatives? The 18-200mm VR & VR II is much sharper. The 70-200mm F2.8 VR or VRII are the very best."
3,eh. not a fan.,"i felt this was a waste of money. we hardly ever use it. the pictures come out nicely, that's for sure, but it just wasn't for us. i'd prefer one lens instead of multiple ones."
3,Okay but...,"I bought this lens as a result of a review of telephoto lenses. It wasn't rated as best but as worthy of consideration (if you want to save some money). Generally, it works well especially considering the price I paid. The one shock was a very obvious, and distracting, lens flare that I got when photographing the moon. It's very possible that it was my fault since I'm not a very good photographer but it's worth looking into if you're considering buying one."
3,Disappointing lens,"I read the reviews here, I read Ken Rockwell's review and looked around through photo forums and thought I had stumbled upon a great deal. This is my least favorite lens. It is definitely not crisp or tack sharp like other reviewers said. Maybe I'm just spoiled by my perfect Tamron 90mm macro, but even on a tripod with VR off, this lens isn't what I would consider sharp. Maybe I just got a dud, but if there's one dud, there are thousands out there. I have to do a lot of sharpening in Photoshop to make up for it. It does focus very quickly, but I find the autofocus doesn't always focus on the point I've selected. It's light yet feels fairly sturdy, but I do worry about it breaking since the mount is plastic. Overall, though, I know I can't afford anything better right now, so it was a good buy. Good but disappointing."
3,So So,"Well, i'm just gonna talk about the negatives of this lens.1. Image Quality at high zoom (200 mm) is average at best. Under 150 mm this thing is great, tho.2. At high zooms, the auto-focus doesn't always focus where you want it to. When i have it locked to the center, it sometimes 'misses' and zooms maybe a meter or so away when I'm at 200 mm, making the subject a little blurry :( I shouldn't say sometimes, I should say about half of the time. SO make sure to take a lot of pictures because half of them won't be perfect focus.Those are my main gripes. This thing is still a steal at 200 bucks tho, but if you're looking for great quality telephoto shots, you may wanna spend a little more $$ and get something better."
3,not too bad.,I first I was afraid because the product made some funky noises. I purchased this item used so the price wasn't too bad. after a while I found out that the noises were normal. Has a high frequency sound when the VR is turned on.Lens is not too bad. Might go with the 18mm-200mm though.
4,Nice addition to my kit,I bought his to complement the 18-55 mm lens that came with my nikon 3100. It is a very good lens and great value...
4,Not a Bad Deal,"I bought this because I needed a zoom on a bargain budget and this was the best I found for my Nikon D90. It has all the issues everyone has already mentioned, but for the price I think it's a great deal. I recently used it to shoot some action shots of a dog jumping competition where they land in water and the pictures came out much better than I expected with this lens. I love the VR feature, since my hands shake a little and this feature helps a great deal. I think it's a good lens for everyday use, but if you really need a zoom lens for more professional work, then save your $$$ and get a higher end one. Overall though, great buy!"
5,Great Product,This lens has really opened up my range of shots. I had the standard lense initially which couldn't get close enough. It's very easy to install and works really well.
4,Second lens review,"As I said in an earlier review I returned my first 55-200 VR lens as defective and received another. It works a lot better. The first one only produced sharp results on the right edge of the frame. The replacement zooms more smoothly, and has typical better center than edge sharpness especially at 200mm. The 55-100mm sharpness is very, very good and although the 200mm is a little soft wide open, it gets much better a stop or two down.Recommended... if you get a correctly assembled lens. Well worth the money."
4,Best Lightweight Budget Telephoto,"Biggest asset is its incredibly light weight. My f/1.4 50mm prime is heavier than this, and although that is partly a matter of plastic vs metal construction, having a lens that equals 300mm on digital barely weigh anything at all is great. Speaking of plastic, the construction is durable, even in the steamy rains of a Costa Rican jungle. The VR does wonders in cutting down on grain and noise, and in daylight and cloudy conditions, the image quality is amazing. However, these things increase when the sun goes down, and then you are almost required to use flash (which I try to avoid.) In addition, this is not a fast lens by any means. Shooting futbol/soccer games are a joke with f/5.6 (although I tried this indoors...) but capturing things such as birds in flight, etc. with good light easily done. All in all, a wonderfully light and sturdy lens for most telephoto situations, but look for faster glass when shooting faster subjects or in low-light."
4,Good lens,"It's my first non-kit lens, I got a 100$ reduction when I got it with my Nikon D40 with kit lens from Amazon. I was revolving around Canon xti and the Nikon D40 for a while, But when I noticed this deal in Amazon I didn't think for a sec, just grabbed it. No regrets now.. This lens is superior to the kit lens in sharpness and can yield professional looking images. I am a novice and got appreciation for most of the pics take with this lens from my friends. You might have to step down the aperture for this lens to get the best results or else you might have to post process the pics to resharpen them ."
4,great lens for vacation,"I bought this lens for the convenience of travelling. I have 80-200mm f2.8 lens which is very much heavier and bulky. Of course the quality of this lens can't match the f2.8. However, no complaint from my kids to hand held and took some shots with this smaller lens. If you need a decent size zoom/telephoto lens for travelling, then this lens might be the right one."
4,Excellent,I recently purchased the nikkor lense for my D40 SLR camera. I have taken few pic with that lense and it looks amazing.I love it with the price and quality.
4,Very nice lens,"I have been a Nikon owner since 1973. I recently sold my Film cameras and bought the D40 and this 55-200 VR lens. It is very sharp and does amazing on the long hand-held shots due to the VR. Price was reasonable. My only complaint is this; it is a fairly slow lens F4-5.6, yes I know that I could have bought a faster lens, but I had a budget to work with and this lens fit the budget. Would I buy it, if I had a chance for ""do-overs""? YES, the speed really hasn't affected any of my photo ops to date."
5,Get it - great lens - great price - and great pics too!,"Don't let the price of this lens fool you into thinking it can't compete with more expensive lenses - the VR system in this lens works beautifully allowing you to take fast and blur free shots in decent lighting - I highly suggest getting this lens if you're on the fence between this lens or the 70-300mm VR (more then twice the price) but not twice the reach - lighter and much easier to carry and handle - the ultimate walk around unit - I suggest getting a good external flash unit to complement your camera as well as the lens - as the build-in camera flash are limited for any serious application moving forward in your photographic journey - hope this helps you in your moment of desperations before ""pulling the trigger"" on this purchase."
3,Works Well For The Price,"This lens works well for distance shots but I find it unusable if the subject is too close. I have used zoom lenses in the past where you could zoom in on fine details such as flower petals, humming birds, etc. This lens does not perform well if that is your intended use. Anything closer than 20 feet cannot be focused. Anything further than 20 feet can be zoomed and focused very well. Good product but not for fine detail. It is also very simple to change out- a real plus when you are on vacation!"
3,"Good lens, bit inconvenient","I got this for my D40 about 6 months ago (the D40 I've had for over a year).I'd describe myself as ""enthusiastic amateur"" - wanting to make the step up from compact point-and-shoot's. I've read a couple of books and online reviews and this seemed like the lens to have.I can't disagree with what anyone's written about the technical ability of the lens - it takes some good (to me anyway), photos. I've got some great close up shots of my dog and it really highlights the coloring.I just wish I'd bought the 18-200 instead. I find the 55-200 terribly inconvenient for the type of photography I end up doing and am frequently changing the lens - something I'm wary of since the first time I ended up with a large smudge on my sensor despite being (I thought) careful.If you do the type of photography where you're not continually recomposing then go for it............but I'd happily sell you my 55-200 and put the cash towards the 18-200 instead."
4,Great but just upgraded,"This is a great intro to telephoto lenses. I had it for my D40, but just sold it to upgrade to the 18-200mm VR.If you can, save up for the 18-200mm. You'll save time and get more shots by not having to swap lenses."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"Apprently alot of the reviews say its a real sharp lens but performs slow.....My take is that its good for OUTDOOR WELL LIT environment, otherwise its totally useless."
4,Just right,Just introduced my wife to DSLR with a D60 Nikon. This is the perfect lens for the novice photographer to compliment the 18-55 that came with it at a very reasonable price.
3,Nikon 55-200mm,"I liked that it was affordable, but I was in the middle of a shot when the lens just froze while the shutter was closed. So I had to turn off my camera then turn it back on to get it back to normal."
2,Nikon 55-200MM VR Zoom Nikkor Lens,"The lense is heavy and a challenge to focus; both distances and up close to the subject. It did not live up to my expectations and was returned to Amazon for a full, hassle-free credit."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"Unfortunately, I found that the VR on this lens didn't perform as I expected (comparing it to the image stabilization on my previous Canon S2 IS). I also didn't like that the focus ring is at the far end of the lens, making it especially difficult to use if the hood in attached."
2,its quality is less than I expected,"the auto focus does not working well, the picture taken by this lens seems not in perfect focus, there are noice ...all the timeI am doubt , is this from Grey market or not,(since there is no USA series number ) but I did purchsed and it is sold by Amazon LLC..what is they hiding ?compare the lense Nikkor 18-55mm are better than this 55-200mm one"
3,It`s ok,"Lens is ok, works fine. however it does use quite a bit of plastic. the plastic makes it light weight, which is great but i was expecting it to be more beefy."
5,Upgrade from the non-VR 55-200,"Upgraded from the non-VR 55-200 lens about a month ago when I was also upgrading from the D40 to the D3200. Haven't had too much of a chance to test how much the VR helps, but from what I've seen indoors in low light, it does make a difference to me. Seems like a quieter motor than the one I had before too."
5,Great lens,Great for shots that are outdoor and from a distance. I do not recommend this lens if you plan on shooting indoors or in room size areas. Easy to use and very reasonable price.
5,excellent product,"I like it a lot, its a good product and the service is excellent too. I waited lot of time to buy it, Im from Colombia, and the product came here in excellent state."
4,good,works ok I should of spent the extra $125.00 and got a new one if you want an ok lens for the price buy it
4,LENS BROKE BUT NIKON CUSTOMER SUPPORT REPLACED IT...,"i purchased this lens in april 08... it broke for no reason after only using it to take pictures on a few occasions. basically it stopped focusing... the motor would just run but the focus would not lock. i sent the lens to nikon customer support and they replaced it immediately. i gave the lens 4 stars because although the lens broke, it was replaced with a new lens without any problem. i enjoy my new lens very much- the photos are wonderful! (i should note, i am only an amateur ""photographer"".)(FYI- before sending it back, i found a few other posts on random websites, reporting the same ""focusing"" issue with this specific lens. all of the problems were with lenses purchased around the same time that my lens was purchased. it seems it was probably a defect in a ""batch"" of lenses that were manufactured at the same time. i am hopeful that this review will help someone else who may have the same issue.)"
3,Good but touchy,"This lens works well but the focus ring is very sensitive, making it difficult to quickly focus on a subject while in manual mode. Otherwise it's what one would expect from Nikon."
3,not what i expected for nikon brand,"I purchased a bundle with my d90 that included this lens and the 18-55mm dx vr. I understand that this is considered a kit lens and I shouldn't expect it to produce professional quality results. That being said, my experience with this lens was lackluster at best. Every shot I took zoomed past the 100mm or so mark was super soft on the focus. Indoor lighting seemed to make this lens hunt for focus like no other I have used (I have somewhere around 15 lenses total ranging from bower t mount all the way to tokina pro uwa). this may cause an uproar but in my honest opinion the sigma 50-200 hsm vc seems to be much sharper throughout the zoom range. I have already replaced this lens as well as the nikon 18-55 with the sigma counterpart. Sigma sold me with the metal mounts, Hopefully Nikon will realize that plastic mounts just turn people (me atleast) off to their lens offerings."
5,SUCH A GREAT ADDITION,"Ok, I'm not photography expert and I'm just a family girl, so my pictures aren't supposed to be professional...however, this lens has helped me look professional. I love the defocus of the background. I've gotten so many compliments on my photos, and a lot of it has to do with this lens and my D3100.I would buy this again in a heart beat. Works great and you won't be disappointed!"
4,Nikon Zoom,"Really appreciate the light weight of this lens. At first not sure of the stabalization feature working, but then the familiar knock sound when system was locking on. Haven't taken many pictures so far with the lens but what I have, seems to be sharp and color right on. With carrying various pieces of equipment on a photo shoot the weight is a big plus."
4,LENS REPLACEMENT,"I found this lens to take the place of four other lens. I wish I had bought it first, It would have save me lost of money"
4,Light weight lens ideal for traveling,"This is a light weight lens, ideal for traveling.This lens is quite sharp from 55mm to 105mm wide open. From 135mm to 200mm, you may need to step down or do some post-processing to sharpen the image a little. VR works as advertised. You general gain about 3 stops. For instance, you should be able to get reasonably sharp images at 1/15 sec at 55mm, and 1/30 sec at 200mm.Vignetting (darker corners) is not noticable from 55mm to 105mm. Vignetting is very pronounced wide open from 135mm to 200mm. Again, stepping down one stop relieves the problem.If you are looking for optical excellent telephoto zoom, you may want to consider 70-300mm VR. If you need a lens you can take with you without breaking your shoulder, this lens is a good choice."
5,Excellent Bargain VR Lens!,"I've read both good and bad about this lens. But I wanted the features such as VR and decided to go ahead and get it. It arrived yesterday and I am very happy to tell you that its well worth the price and more. Its sharp from edge to edge and fast to focus. I have two other VR lenses, both I'm extremely happy with and this one falls in with them. I'm using this lens on a D80 and I've tried it several different conditions including overcast sky, moderate sunlight and indoor lighting and its given excellent results every time."
5,Awesome,"I bought this when I needed some more zoom length. It is truly an awesome lens. I use this for my primary lens. I actually shot an entire wedding using this lens and had no compaints. It was a little tough in low light, but nothing that couldn't be overcome. I didn't see any distortion at max zoom (pincushion) at all. Overrall this is a great lens and a must have if your a Nikon shooter."
4,Good entry telephoto,This lens is a great complement to the 18:55 kit lens which comes with most cameras. Focus is fast and sharp with only some blur in low-light. The vibration reduction is a great feature and should be used. A great option for someone who does not mind switching lenses rather that going for a much more expensive 18:200 lens.
5,great lens for the price,"I've only been able to use it a few times since I bought it, at a parade and at the Fort Worth Stock Show and have been pretty pleased with the results I'm getting with it. I like the fact that it has the image stabilization, comes in handy for those tight close ups of objects that are far way. Haven't really had the auto focus problems that some people are having, it's always locked right onto my subject and kept them in focus.And the f/4 gives you just enough to depth of field to throw the background out of focus to make your subject pop out, which always makes for a good picture."
2,Either a defective lens or mediocre performance,"I just received, and used this lens at a wedding last weekend. I was not thrilled with the results. I expected sharp, snappy contrasty images but they weren't - just okay.I then mounted the camera with this lens on a tripod, switched off the VR and autofocus and took a series of left, right and center pictures at different f stops of a distant sign with lots of lettering. I was even more disappointed as the left edge was blurry, and the images got better tto the right of the frame and not the center as expected. I hope that this is a sign of a defect, and not sloppy manufacturing.This lens is bargained priced, with the VR feature which seems to work, but at least in my instance the image quality is poor. When, and if I can get a replacement lens I'll update this message after taking the same test shots."
4,Nikon DX VR,"Great piece of equipment, the 200mm is just what we needed for close up shots at the speedway, while being a safe distance away I would give the lens 5 stars but i was a touch un-impressed with amazon's speed of delivery for a product of this much quality and cost.rockmullinville ks"
2,Not up to Nikon Standards,"I wondered how a Nikkor lens could cost so little - now I know. The quality of construction of this lens is shockingly poor. Especially in comparison to the other AF-S DX lenses in this series. The mount is plastic. The image quality is poor above 150mm. Bottom line: I'll save up for the new AF-S DX NIKKOR 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR, which reviews indicate has a better build quality and overall performance. It cost almost twice as much, but in this case saving money on the cheaper model is not a good option."
2,Nikon lens took too long to deliver,"I was very disappointed that the lens didn't arrive until after Christmas. They were a gift from my daughter to her husband. The seller had 9 days to deliver the lens but it took 11 days. It took the seller too long to get it to Fedex and the lens arrived in Kent, WA 2 days before Christmas and it took them 4 days to get the lens 35 miles."
4,93% of Amazon reviews are Favorable,"198 out of 214 Amazon reviews gave this a 4 or 5-star rating. That's a 93% favorable rating. Pretty good for a lens at this price point.I have it and also have the 70-200 f/2.8 at $1600.For regular family shots, newspaper shoots, this is a 4-star lens. It is very light, too. VR works very well. The f/2.8 is like carrying aroung a lead pipe, so I leave it home when I shoot parades or have good lighting situations. When I want the best I use the f/2.8...but, you'll find critics of this lens, too.Let's face it: Most lenses today are pretty darn good. At this price it's hard to pass up. If you don't have a long lens, want to have some fun, and not rupture your bank account, this lens is for you."
4,Great lens for beginner.,I bought this lens for my 16 year-old daughter who has taken a real interest in photography. This lens gives her another dimension to explore her interest and she loves it.
1,Reviews were great but mine came defective,"I purchased this because the price was right and the ratings were high. The item arrived appearing fine but after I put it on my Nikon D5100, I quickly realized something was wrong. When I tried to focus, the lens movements were very loud, and certainly did not sound right. There was no way of focusing on the lens.... it had blurry spots on the sides. I tried playing with it and adjusting it to no avail. I ended up packing it up and sending it back. It's a shame since I was looking forward to a nice lens like everyone said it was."
1,Not Reliable,"I purchased this lens from Amazon in October, 2007. It seems to be defective. When using the zoom at 200mm, the autofocus constantly clicks (like it's hunting for proper focus), and the pictures all come out blurred - more like double vision - in bright light. The VR didn't help at all.The problem is not present when using the lens at 55mm. Go figure.Sending it back to Nikon for repair or replacement - Amazon was no help. I'm a huge Amazon user, but in this instance I probably should have purchased locally so I could just walk it back to the store in the event of a problem.I'll update this review with how Nikon ends up resolving the problem."
2,Not sharp :s,"Well, I got this lens because I wanted a zoom for my photowalks to the zoo and such.I got this one because I cant really afford the 70-300 and decided to settle for thisone, Big mistake! The pictures are not sharp AT ALL, as soon as you get to 135mm everythingstarts to blur.I really say that if you can afford the 70-300 better go for that one, because this lens doesnot provide pin sharp images or anything close to it for that matter."
3,not bad but not very useful,"it is very light and if you need to take a close up of something that is not too far away then it will work for you. It has difficulties sometime when focusing on something at around 200mm. If you want to have a tele lens and do not want to spend too much money then it is a good choice.I would like to suggest to get the 18-200mm for the convenience if you want to have one lens for everything, especially if you take pictures mostly indoor or in city. If you need a tele lens and you are on a budget, then get the 70-300 for $100 more and get more tele power.It does not work if you use it as one fits all lengs. You can only use it as a tele lens so you will need to switch with another lengs when you are out taking pictures. Also it dost not give you too much tele power. So that is why I would like to say it is not very useful."
2,nikon 55-200mm VR zoom lens,I use this lens with my D50 DSLR camera. The auto focus broke on the lens after the first 50 pictures. I had to manually focus. Will soon see how good Nikon's warrant repair is.
2,Most of photos coming out are not sharp,"Having used zoom lenses in almost the same range from different producers (Nikon, canon, Sony, Promaster) I found this lens disappointing. Specially that I had high hopes to a Nikon built kit lens (my 18-55 is excellent).Most of the photos are out of focus and not sharp. The fact that some photos are sharp tells me that the focus is to be blamed (in a tripod setup , VR off).The VR (version 1) was a total disappointment to me too (again in comparison to Sony's in-body, Cannon and VRii on 18-55). It hardly compensates 1 stop for me (while I was hoping for 3). It appears to me that it does not even turn on sometimes (judging from the VR motor's noise).It is possible that the lens is defective but Amazon's ratings should also reflect quality control of products.I obtained the lens from overseas and I could not even use the Guarantee, but that's another story (my own greed for a 20% cheaper price)."
1,Very disapointed. Not focus.,"I had this lens for 4 months. Images are soft in all light conditions and for all focual lengths. Not even one sharp picture in 4 months shooting. VR is good, focusing speed is okay. But if it can not focus, it is just a piece of crap. My word to you is that don't be carzy about brand names.I am puzzled by so many 5-star reviews. May be I just had bad luck picking up one rotten apple in basket.Sent the piece back to Nikon for servise. Will update."
1,I am hoping that I just got a defective one.,"I can't say that I am all that impressed with the VR function. Using it on my D80 and their is very little difference between VR and non-VR photos inside on a bright day. I hate using a flash and hoped that this lens would help me capture photos in lower light without the flash. I was dead wrong. In my living room on a very sunny day setting the shutter on 1/25, I still got a huge amount of blur. I have not been able to get any of my photos to look any better with the VR on vs. the VR off. and I have tried everything. I spent an hour on the phone with the Nikon rep who couldn't figure out what was going on.For the most part, this has turned out to be the exact same lens as my 18-135mm kit lens with a small weight difference."
2,"Expensive anywhere, not enough extra zoom for price","For the money paid for this extra zoom, i wasen't impressed at all with this product. It's ok, but unless it was cheaper than before, I wouldn't reccomend it.................."
1,Packaging for shipment,"I received the lens I ordered but the packaging bubbles were flattened. I am not sure the lens is not damaged, as it is a gift to someone who has a Nikon camera. It does not appear visibly broken but I am not sure what to do."
5,very happy with this lens,Great service and all that I expected. Even had it checked out at a local camera store and they were impressed how good it was.
4,GOOD LENS,"I purchased this lens for my daughter as a graduation present. She is more than satisfied with the quality and performance of this lens. I, personally, do not know much about cameras or photography as she does. Giving her reactions to the performance and construction I can recommend this to others wishing to purchase the lens."
5,Lens,Since I purchased this product I am enjoying taking pictures. This telephoto lens has given me some excellent pictures. I would recommend this product for beginners and the everyday picture takers.
4,Hard to decide,"I bought this lens 2 weeks ago, and now I used it several time. Generally, it's ok for most situation, and you can feel the advantage of VR. However, in some conditions, especially when the object you want to shoot have the similiar colors with the background, it can't focus correctly. In my conclusion, it's fair considering it's price, you can shoot sth. that kit len can't reach it, and the photo quality is ok, but you also need to tolerent the inconvienence of switching lens frequently."
5,THE LENS,"This is the lens I use almost everyday. I have an 18-55mm lens and I'm afraid it is going to waste because I love my 55-200mm VR to death. The funny thing is the VR isn't even noticeable until you see the pictures it creates. Decently fast focusing makes tracking objects easy. The only drawback is that it stops at 200, and a few times I've needed that extra 100mm. So I might end up buying another lens."
2,Mechnically fragile,"No problem with image quality. Mechanically, however, is not very solid. Auto focus stopped working after few uses. Cannot figure out why."
5,Great upgrade lens,"I purchased this lens for my Nikon d40 , the VR works great and pix are very sharp.Great value for the money."
5,Must have..,great add on to existing d3000 with 18-55mm lens. need to have to zoom into shots from a distance. this is a great price for the lens.
5,good,got what they said about the product.i always trust this site.i got this product on time and lences work as good as new . thanks
4,4 * only because of price,"I have been using this product for years and I love it. The natural scent of almonds, the smooth consistency, and the way my skin feels afterwards are great. In fact, all the Dr. Hauschka products are superb! Ideally, one should use them long-term, as the skin needs to learn how to heal itself. Sometimes that may involve a short ""healing crisis"" or as described by other users as 'whiteheads'.It's too bad that this cleansing cream is so expensive :("
4,"Great stuff, whimsical and fun","Most of the songs verge on being laugh out loud funny. Mixed in are one or two more serious (or less amusings) pieces, as well as one or two that fall flat. I think my enjoyment of the CD is enhanced by the fact that I've seen KY&E live, and they give good show. But if you're in the mood for something different, with perhaps a touch of Presidents of the USA, give Kenny Young and the Eggplants a try."
4,A Helpful Guide,"I read this book in two nights. I would recommend it especially to any parent whose child has been recently diagnosed with ADHD. Especially informative where chapters regarding working with the school system and educators. Clear and easily understood information regarding diagnosis, evaluation, the IEP process, IDEA, 504 plans etc. would be especially helpful to parents entering into the educational system. Chapters on home behavior management and techniques, and information to help parents better understand our wonderful children who live with ADHD will help any parent be a better advocate for their child. Highly recommended, an easy and informative read."
4,Steven's word,"I love it !!! I had the orignal Pronto for at least 5 years and I would have never parted with it , but I dropped it. The new Pronto took alittle time to learn and has more manual buttons , then pure touchscreen buttons. Overall I recommend the Pronto for anyone that has more than 3 remotes for their home theater."
4,Good shoe,"A little stiff at first, but now they fit great. Awkward spot for the velcro strap when you're standing and just trying to kick them off, but that's a minor quip in what is really a well designed shoe."
5,Excellent Value,"These sandals are of very high quality leather - very comfortable and after a month of nearly daily use, promise to be quite durable."
4,Very Comfortable Sandals,"This is my third pair. The others each lasted several years with daily use from May to September. There is a notable cushioned feeling with each step; no hard landings.The loop through which the strap pulls is a little too small, and so I have to diddle with the strap a bit to loosen the strap completely. A better sized loop and I would give these sandals 5 stars instead of 4.The sandals are very comfortable.I typically am using two brands of sandals, Rockport and Clark, both the same style. They are equally comfortable, although the Rockport has more cushion. I alternate wearing the two brands, because the variation is support between the two brands is good for my 75 year-old feet."
1,Awful.,"This broke 1 week after we received it. Oneof the rubber covers on one of the controls comes off which is a chocking hazard for my other smaller children, even though they do not play with it they will find it on the ground.If this didn't come with my GameCube and I had bought it alone I would be even more upset."
3,Spongebob Controller,"Overall, the product is quality is fair, in my opinion. The controller that I received seemed lighter and less sturdy than the officially licensed Nintendo gamecube controllers. I also noticed a fair amount of play in the seams between the upper and lower portion of the plastic body of the controller that I received, which causes me to question the controller's longterm durability. The aesthetics are great (my kids love the looks of the controller) and the button functions are just as good as those found on the standard Gamecube controllers. If I did not have the durability concerns, I would rate this product much higher."
4,Spongebob Controller GameCube,This is a good controller. I have a used one and it works fine except it takes some effort to press some buttons and the control stick isn't very comfortable. The great thing that I love about it is that the cord length is pretty long.
2,We love Spongebob but we don't like this controller!,"This controller initially worked very well with my childrens' Game Cube, but after some time of using this controller my children complained of the characters moving by themselves and then the system would not stay on for very long before it would cut itself off. I ended up calling Nintendo and was advised that aftermarket controllers and memory cards can cause this conditon. I was told not to use the controller anymore and since then we've had no more problems."
1,Keep Away,"Purchased from Home Depot in 2008. Never used to mulch, blower only. Died on 10/07/2009 in the middle of major clean up.Keep away from this product. Not much of a value.I am going to buy other brand"
4,It Works,"I like using it as a blower and as a mulcher; the two speeds are more valuable than I would've thought. The only drawback is the position of the zipper for emptying the leaf bag. If you're putting mulched leaves into bags, it's almost impossible to do so without spilling some leaves (the zipper is on the long edge rather than the shorter one). Otherwise, I like it."
5,BETTER THAN EXPECTED !,"I BOUGHT THE TORO MODEL # 51592 TO DO MY LARGE PATIO CLEANING AND WHEN I RECEIVED IT, I WAS MORE BLOWN AWAY THAN THE MANY LEAVES I HAD TO CLEAN OFF THE PATIO. IT CAN DO IN A MERE MINUTE WHAT SWEEPING TOOK 15-20 MINUTES TO DO. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT ! I HAVEN'T USED THE VACUUM PORTION OF THE MACHINE YET, BUT I'M EXPECTING EXCELLENT RESULTS. THE ""REGULAR"" BLOWER SPEED IS MORE THAN ADEQUATE. SELDOM USE ""HIGH""."
4,Hubby loves this.,"My husband loves this now that he has read the instructions. He thought it was defective on 2 different occasions. First he wasn't putting it together correctly. More recently he thought the battery was waring out prematurely. Turns out you can only use it on high for a limited period of time and it shuts off. That too is explained in the instructions. If you are purchasing this product, make sure you read the instructions, even if you are a man who likes to bypass that step before using something new. Otherwise, it's light weight and works great!"
5,It works great for what we need it for!,"My husband uses this to vacuum up the debris that falls between our 1""-2"" decorative river rocks. It sucks up the leaves, but not the rocks. He's also used the blower function in the small backyard. He's quite happy with it overall. Easier to vacuum the backyard debris than tugging around the shop vac."
5,Very pleased,This is our second one. Glad to find that it works just as well. Would highly recommend to all. Also a very good price with free shipping.
3,Too heavy,"The machine works well, but needs to be made lighter. As an elderly person I am able to use the leaf blower/vacuum only for short intervals because of its weight."
5,Great item for the price!,This item works great! I've been using for about a month and everything works perfectly.
5,Toro 51592 Super 12 Amp 2-Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum,Very cost effective Blower/Vacuum. This is my second one. I used the first one for many years until the blower fan blade broke. Both were purchased thru Amazon.com and I am very happy with its performance and longivity.
5,Great little tool,This blower works so well in blowing leaves off of our decks and also in gently blowing them into a container for curbside pick-up.
4,great machine at a great price,"This leaf blower / vac works great in our smaller 2000 sq foot garden. The vac mulching attachment probably gets leaves condensed about 3 to 1, resulting in less bagging and less bending over. The blower has enough power to blow leaves big and small, two speeds give you great control. What I love most about this machine is the cost, for only $55, leaves are easily manageable (no more paying for garden services!)"
4,Toro Super 12 amp blower,"This unit lives up to its specification on wind speed. However you have to use the nozzlereducer to reach the maximum speed. Two speeds allow for lower velocity blowing. Reasonable weightif you can handle the electrical cord, its a very effective blower, without the hassles and pollution of two cycle-power gas alternatives."
3,"Nice, but not great","I don't know where they got the 10-bags-into-1 idea. It works great, except that it needs to be emptied more frequently than I would have expected/wanted. Also, it doesn't suck up leaves that quickly either. However, it definitely picks up all the leaves you put it near."
3,Not a huge fan...,"This leaf blower is just okay. I really don't know too much about them, so I do not claim to be an expert. It is powerful enough to blow leaves around. However, if there are a lot of leaves or when the pile starts to get deep, this leaf blower does not have the power to handle them. I would say it is great for light yard work, but I would recommend going with a different option if you have a lot of leaves that accumulate in your yard."
5,Loud but works great,"Excellent product. One tip though, I wrapped duct tape around the bag connector to minimize any fine dust escaping. It is loud, as others have said, but you should be wearing ear protectors anyway. Be careful as the suck and mulching action really works. I inadvertently sucked up a pair cheap brown cotton work gloves and thought ""no problem, just stuck in the fan"" but no, they didn't even slow it down as it mulched them to fine pieces.thehman"
1,Dead on Arrival,"This was an anticipated Christmas gift. However, after unboxing and assembling the blower, it would not start. Reseated all parts, checked extension cords, and it still would not operate. Called Customer Service and was advised to return the unit to the Toro Service Center, pre-paid. This is not a small unit and the shipping cost was $20. It will take approx 3+ weeks for the repair.There is a huge quality control problem here. This unit never should have left the factory. If your unit requires a repair, know that there is no easy or inexpensive solution."
4,Leaf Vacuum,"My purchase is an electric Toro leaf blower and vacuum. Item performs much as claimed, strong vacuum and blower capability, not very good as a mulcher. Price was very competitive. Believe I will receive good service for my intended use."
4,blower/vac review,"I had an earlier model of this unit and it lasted for 8 years, I couldn't find it locally so was very happy to obtain it thru Amazon.com, it works just great and I hope it will last as long as the previous model did"
1,shortcomings of the Toro Ultra with hose and bag,"The 12 amp Toro motor is strong. So strong, in fact that it will blow the hose and collector bag right off your garbage can creating the biggest mess you've seen. The hose goes into the top of the bag so is continually trying to collapse the bag. The biggest problem is that the bag doesn't have enough surface area to allow the volume of air produced by the motor, to escape. So you can't use the tool at peak efficiency without creating the huge mess. At the slower motor speeds, the process is painfully slow- easier to hand rake. Toro has no solution and is not interested in discussing it. If you don't mind carrying the shoulder bag around the product works ok."
4,Price only decision.,"I actually only looked at this toro to compare with all the other 12 amp 2 speed blower/vacs. I bought the Black and Decker for 2 reasons. 1. I'm replacing my blower/vac that I've used since 1985 that is still working but very much ""worn out."" The price of $49 is well worth it. Looking to get another 26 years out of this one."
2,Only lasted 2 seasons,"This unit was well-reviewed by ""a leading consumer testing company"" and I only used it for leaves in the fall, both blowing and vacuuming. It lasted 2 seasons before the motor just quit. My previous Craftsman lasted almost a decade - now that's reliable."
4,jacksT,"This blower/Vac meets my needs in every way. If my yard was large, it might be alittle slow, but for a typical yard, it should meet most people's need. Having two speeds in quite adequate. I am a little bit concerned about the plastice impeller. From time to time I get some acorns which could potentuially damage the plastic impeller.Switching from blower to vac is a relatively simple task. All the connecting parts are made of plastic. I can't judge how long the plastic parts will hold up.Having used this blower/vac a number of times, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this Toro again."
1,Weaker than the old one,This machine is less powerful than the same one it replaced. Tested it against the old one and that one was stronger. Looks identical but this new one is way weaker. Just too much of a hassle to return.
5,Suck it up,"Bought this blower/vac last year and it works perfectly. I have yet to use the blower function, but based on other reviews it appears that it will work well. Vacuum feature works very well, and am able to fill up one of the paper leaf bags very quickly. Previously when raking my lawn it would take 3 leaf bags to take up everything on my lawn, with the mulching feature of this blower/vacuum only one bag is needed. Only one caution, vacuum leaves when they are dry because the attached cloth bag tends to leak on your trousers and when you are done you need to change trousers. If you turn the bag inside/out when done vacuuming it drys nicely, and when it gets really dirty just throw it in the washing machine and it comes out almost like new. Excellent machine with no problems."
3,"Excellent blower, but don't use this one for mulching","I've used this as a blower for about 6 months.However it is spring now and the yard needs some cleanup. I thought I would use my Toro as a vacuum and mulch some leaves.It lasted about three minutes before it suddenly started shaking uncontrollably. Inspection showed that one of the fins on the (plastic!) impeller had broken off. It is now useless as a blower as well.If you have a choice, go for the more expensive version with a magnesium (metal) impeller:Toro Ultra 12 Amp Electric Blower/Vacuum #51599.I am now ordering a replacement magnesium impeller (SKU TOR-108-8967) from M & D Mower in Ohio for $16.96 (shipping $7.95 to NV).This is the second time where I have bought the cheaper option of two identical products, and the extra $10 would have saved me a lot of headaches.If I had to rate this as a blower only, it would get 5 stars, no question."
1,RECALL needed : Used 3 times - It went up in smoke...service/repair has been problematic,I had a previous version of this blower for 5 years. Worked great until the impeller broke while mulching. I decided to buy the newer version.I've only used it 3 times only to do some light blowing of leaves and grass.The motor began to slow and surge ...then began to smoke and spark. Obviously Toro has a quality control problem with these units.I've had fits trying to get it repaired. I went to Toro's website and local Ace Hardwares store that are supposed to service it are all saying we can't. Since I bought it from Amazon I just can't march back into the store and demand my money back. Be warned..you will have problems if you buy this unit and it needs repair. I will try another brand next time.
5,Wicked Awsome,Has a lot of power.Great for home owners.Will save you from hiring someone to do your clean ups.Even the kids will like using it.
4,Toro leaf blower,"This blower does a great job of blowing and vacuuming leaves. It has plenty of power and is user friendly. The collection bag is an adequate size. The attachments are simple and easy to use. It was a little more bulky than I thought it might be, but it certainly does the job !!"
4,TORO LEAFBLOWER,"I have used it numerous times. It has surprising power. I bought it to replace my Craftman gas blower which was junk and never ran well from the time I got it. Although this is an electric model and the cord is somewhat of a burden you just plug it in and turn the switch, it works every time. It mulches leaves just as good as the gas model and blows almost as well on high speed. It works surprisingly well and the price $45 with free shipping was an added bonus. I would easily recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a large property."
4,"Very Pleased, Except for the Bag","I bought this item because of users' great reviews. It works wonderfully, except for the bag, which is unwieldy for a woman of moderate height. However, even the six foot tall man of the house also thought it uncomfortable. I found myself trying to set it on a lawn chair while vacuuming the leaves (which were in a pile). The documentation is superb though--very unusual these days."
1,cheap crap.,My four year old could have done a better job. Get what you pay for though. they don't fit adults.
1,Miserable,"Cheaply made, the ear clips are very uncomfortable. NO matter how much I try to open them up, they stay as is."
4,Mirror Lenses US Air Force Style Aviator Sunglasses By Rothco,I received the glasses promptly and they were well packnaged.The glasses themselves are pretty much what you see in the ad photograph.I find the materials suitable for everyday wear and had no trouble adjustingthem to my head.The case is a basic one so you might want to get a separate hard case.
3,These fellas stick far off your face.,"They wont come off, thats for sure, but i like the kind that hug youre eyes, theyre about a 1"" and 1/2 from your cheek."
3,"Looks Good, But!!!","Glasses were as expected, but, Case could have been of better quality material........... made of cheap plastic, or something like plastic...."
4,good glasses,These glasses are great they block a lot of sun and wont fall off your head.Overall a great product.
3,Short but sweet,"These glasses look great. I can't wear them, however, because the arms of the glasses are too short to rest comfortably around my ears. Also, the case you see is completely disposable, it is not a hard shell case; don't let the included case be the thing to push you in the direction of buying these."
1,Kids toy glasses,Is this some sort of joke? Not worth two dollars! I feel robbed of the ten dollars I spent on these toy glasses.
4,How many times can I say it great!,"I have been waiting on this cd for years. I was in 6th grade when it came out. I have been sing Got a Date to myself for years. Now I can hear it properly. This collection is need to also to hear the original version of ""So Amazing"". Luther later re-recorded ,and then there is a beyonce and Stevie wonder version. But Luther wrote it for his idol Dionne and it it is perfect. When he recorded it he did it the same exact way."
4,Lutherized Dionne,"""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" is the best track on this old school Arista LP. Warwick shines brightly on the obscure track. It alone should have been released as a single for R&B; consumption. But, Clive Davis and co. only wanted big money from Warwick's pop following. Ill promotion bought ill sales results. DW's duet with Luther did generate some charting on R&B; thanks to a video they shot. With exception of ""Got A Date"", this LP is a ""B"" overall. It ranks second to ""Heartbreaker"" for me. I am a diehard Warwick fan with knowledge of all her recorded work.""Thank you, very large""."
2,Too much work to be worth it...,"My son LOVES the Wizard of Oz movie, so I thought I'd get him this for Christmas...well, it's February, and we still haven't cut out any of the masks. Not only are they very difficult to cut out, but you need a whole bunch of other tools, like an X-acto knife, and the old time paper prong connectors that I can't seem to find anywhere. This will probably go unused for quite a while."
3,"JD, a top producer, but still got stuff to learn.","Don't get me wrong, the album isn't the worst ever, but I feel Dupri lacked a bit of imagination. Wit' Ludacis (2:Welcome to Atlana,) Nate Dogg (8:Ballin' Out of Control) and Kurupt (13: Whatever) on the joint, the album can never be poor, but I feel wit' the album 'Life in 1472' to live up to, he was never gonna reproduce the masterclass on this album.Overall, not bad but wit' a bit more effort could have lived up to his previous album. Dirty South 4 Sho'!!!"
1,JD looks like a Burnt Smurf.,"Man, good CD, but I have trouble getting past his burnt smurf persona. This is one funny azz lookin dude."
2,more instructions,i've got two things to say about this album. he took to long and tried to hard. the last album was far tighter.
2,....,"I have never really been a JD fan, but I decided to give him another chance when I got this CD. And I still understand why I didn't like him from the beginning. His flow is too commercial for my liking and his verses are focused on materialistic things. One up side to the album, however is the beats. They are some really good beats, but too bad they are wasted on this trashy album.JD should stay away from rapping and stick to producing. There are only two really good songs on the album, Welcome To Atlanta & Hate Blood. And neither of these songs are good because of Dupri.There are some really good people featured on the album, and that makes the CD twice as dissappointing. JD - you need to improve your rapping or just give up altogether."
1,"Just produce, and keep your smelly mouth shut. You midget.","He can produce, props for that. But he should just keep his mouth shut. Damn, that annoying voice. Damn, it's a shame how he rapes his own beats by rhyming over them."
4,A lot of information....,"As the other reviewer said, this book is not as user friendly as it could be. That said, however, this book has a massive amount of information to pass on. It is definately written for the experienced sewer. The book details the alterations needed for nearly every body configuration that you can think of. A good index would make this a valuable ""cookbook"" of solutions for nearly every fitting problem that a person could present, but I don't think it would be fair to concentrate on that shortcoming to the exclusion of all it does offer. As I said, this is for experienced (advanced) sewers. I really appreciate this book and have bookmarked the parts that apply to me and keep in my sewing room so it is available whenever I get a new pattern that needs ""adjusting."""
3,The Sew\Fit Manual- A Guide to Making Patterns Fit,"This book contains some very useful information, but it is not very user-friendly. For example, it is very difficult to refer to the steps outlined by the authors when the book itself will not stay open without breaking the spine. A ring-binding would have been less frustrating. Missing words, confusing diagrams, awkward sentence structure, written in an atmosphere reminiscent of college educational theory courses makes this text hard to ""digest"". However, I am determined to get past these obstacles because the core imformation seems worth it. I hope that a truly revised edition is planned for the near future."
3,Not Bad,"The book is indeed the one advertised - but it is a MUCH older version than what is on the market today. It is the 1978 edition. I do wish I had known that it is the old version of the book. In fact, it is the precursor to Fitting Finess by Nancy Zieman. The book arrived as was promised in the condition stated. For a beginner sewist it is a great book. It explains in great detail all the steps to be taken, working in tips on measurement. A peek inside the book would have helped me make a better choice since I already own Fitting Finess which has all the same info in it in a more modern approach."
5,Buy this and not the $150 kit,"The CD has the text of the $150 kit on it. And the latest version of all the utilities. What? You actually thumb through manuals? No you don't, you go to the index and look it up like everybody else. You find what you want and use it. All you need is on the CD. Just change your paradigm. Get with it, this is the real thing. Throw those thick manuals away, they're just stroking your ego, sitting on a shelf letting everyone see that you use NT. BIG DEAL! Get some work done with this."
2,Only get it if you have to...,"There is no book included in this. The CD is essentially the same as the Supp 1 CD with only a few utilities changed near as I can tell. Get it if one of the utilities you have problems with is fixed by it, otherwise wait for the next kit.."
1,Wait.,Don't waste your money on this. If anything put the money towards a subscription to technet and wait for this CD to be included in technet's updates
2,Microsoft should have held off the release,"No book, some new utilities, a few updated utilities, updated online help documents, and a TechNet CD. Unless there are some stunning new utilities in Supplement Two that I haven't discovered, I'd recommend that you save your money.Peter"
1,Looks good -- didn't work,"Nice looking product, but it didn't work. I liked its look enough to keep it if the kg setting would consistently work (I'd much prefer the lbs setting), but it would only work if I fiddled with the switch for a while -- and it would never come 'back to life' the way it was supposed to."
2,nice until it broke,"Nice-looking, sleek design, nice price... Unfortunately, you get what you pay for- scale would not turn on and/or would not zero out less than a month after purchased. I ended up returning it."
3,trendy but inconvenient.,Looks great but the touch part doesn't work... I have to pick it up an inch and make it fall onto the floor before the sensor realizes I want it to turn on. Very inconvenient when I've had some before where I could just tap it with my foot and it'd come on..
4,Nice accurate scale!,This is a nice looking scale and it's very accurate. It is very clear to read while standing on it. I love the digital scales much more then the not so easy to read dials.The only thing I don't like about this scale is it doesn't turn on my tapping it. I've learned to pick it up using my toe and dropping it just a tad. Then it turns on. In the directions it says to tap it with you feet and I just can't seem to do that right.Otherwise this is a great scale for the price.
2,Ok,"It serves its purpose, but you need more than a foot tap to turn it on. Basically you have to hit it to get it working"
1,it is borken,"i don't know it is a broken one. my friend told me it is not always happened. unfortunity, i got it... i think if it is a good one, i will like it so much."
2,Newline Bathroom Scale,"The instructions said to ""lightly tap"" the scale to get it to turn on. The reality is that you need to drop it from at least a foot in the air for it to turn on. I can't use this scale in the morning without waking up the entire house (and possibly a few neighbors). This scale looks great, but the functionality doesn't follow. Why not have a power button like every other device?"
4,Precise but not accurate.,"Precise (repeatable) but my unit was off by 3 pounds (inaccurate) compared to a more expensive digital scale (not sure of make) and my doctor's certified scale. I want to retract my previous comment that it is a battery burner - the batteries that came with the unit were defective (Chinese) and even though they started out at a full voltage, they didn't last. Duracell 2032s have worked for many months and can be bought for $1 a piece on line. All in all a good buy. Place the scale where you can't step on the edge and, through leverage, send it flying - probably not good for the strain gauges."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I purchased this for my son to take to school with him - I had to send it back. 3 Reasons Not To Buy This....1) Quality - There is a reason this product costs what it does....it's 7mm glass, so it is really flimsy & if you weigh over 120 lbs it feels like it is going to crack under your feet.2) It has a very small display so it is hard to read the what the weight measurement is.3) Accuracy - The weight measurements were not consistant. I really question how accurate this scale is.The item ""looks"" good....until you get it home....Try another scale !"
4,Mostly good.,"I got what I expected with this scale, thanks to the other reviews on Amazon. There really isn't much to add. It works well, and is mostly designed well except that the ""light tap"" to activate it is more like a heavy stomp, which is irritating. Another reviewer recommended lifting up the bottom edge with your toe maybe half an inch and letting it drop, and this seems to work pretty well, despite the ""clunk."" But with that being the only thing to complain about, all in all it's a good, reliable scale."
1,Newline Best Value Digital Bathroom Glass Scale -It's OK,"I agree with everyone that this is a very nice LOOKING scale but when it it comes to using it.....well. YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY DROP THE SCALE ON THE FLOOR FOR IT TO TURN ON!!!!! I thought at first it was just me, I fooled around with it forever thinking they COULDN'T of made it like this, THEY DID. If you don't mind having to drop the scale on the floor multiple times to turn it on this is the scale for you!!"
3,O-K But Not Great,"I bought this a few months ago when I decided to lose some weight (which I have). I like the look of the scale; minimalist and modern. However mine does not work if you step on it or push on it, as it is supposed to. I have to lift up one edge and let it drop onto my hardwood floor. This usually wakes it up (unfortunately it also wakes up my downstairs neighbor!).Others might have sent it back but for what it cost I didn't bother. I will buy a different, more expensive scale later. Until then I will just use this one, but only when my neighbor is at work."
1,thumbs down,I was so excited about this scale - it looked great! Sadly it did not function as expected. In order to activate it I had to lift it up and drop it on the floor which made me nervous since it is made of glass. I am sure my downstairs neighbor did not appreciate that either. Sent the scale back to Amazon the next day. Newline customer service was less then helpful.
3,Some parts are misleading,"The only thing the U.S. Federal Government is guilty of is not heeding the warning of their informants inside the militia and hate groups. Hoffman's explosive experts are convincing in their assesment of the bomb damage, a larger bomb or more explosives would have been necessary. The other part that is believable is the connection between the U.S. hate and militia groups. As for the eye witnesses that saw McVeigh talking to Arabs or seeing different McVeigh's (Hoffman says that their is an ATF agent that looks identical to McVeigh), they claimed things that only trained proffesionals would be able to notice. All in all the book is worth reading, it's a definite wake up call to what is happening within the borders of the United States. A sourcebook for what these militia/hate groups are capable of doing when they are financed and organized."
2,Nothing like the Classic movie,"Our two year old son loves the original Winnie the Pooh movie, so we decided to purchase this video to accompany it. This DVD just doesn't compare. We were disapointed with it."
4,Good Read before the Election,"The late Donald Westlake was a master of his craft. Crisp, realistic dialog, with a judicious use of slang make his novels some of the most readable there are. Put a Lid on it, is the story of a career criminal who is sprung from jail while awaiting trial on federal charges by the President's reelection committee. ""Nixon botched the Watergate break in because he used political hacks, instead of pros."" It's a great story idea and Westlake pulls it off. I would have given the book 5 stars, but I like my bad guys bad. These guys are ""good"" bad guys. The novel reminded me of Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr series, which I abandoned in search of real bad guys. Westlake wrote almost 100 novels under a dozen pen names. I read 361 before Put a Lid on it. In 361 there were lots of bad guys and shootem-ups. I'm going to read more of Westlake's works. In this political season, Put a Lid on it, is a fun read, regardless of your political leanings."
5,Enjoyed it a lot!!!,"I've been a fan since ""What's the Worst That Could Happen?"" and didn't think that the ""good crooks"" could get any better than Dortmunder, but I fell in love with Meehan. Clever, funny, and smart. I enjoyed this one from beginning to end. There were times when the humor was so subtle that I almost missed the joke. I like books that make me have to pay attention. This is another Westlake winner. I highly recommend it."
3,Don't Keep a Lid on the Secret that is Westlake,This mightn't be Westlake's greatest literacy achievement but it is still pretty good. Meehan a career criminal who has spent much time behind bars hijacked a federal truck mistaking it for something else. He now faces a lifetime in a federal facility and does not look forward to it. One day a man comes to visit him telling him he is his new lawyer. Meehan sees straight through him but this does not matter he is still recruited. This man and others want Meehan to commit a crime to save the president of the USA from a scandal and if he does he will be a free man.This is an interesting book although not Westlake's best. That title would by far go to his masterpiece the Ax. Corkscrew is another good novel as well. This one is worth reading as well but it is not in the masterpiece league of the Ax.
3,The lid was loose,"I'm familar with most of Westlake's work and a large fan of his fine Dortmunder series. In Put a Lid on It Westlake targets his bitting sarcasm on current American Politics and people he observes every day in Manhatten.The anti-hero ""Hey"", noted as what the cops call him in the fly-leaf, was jammed up on a charge of robbing the U.S. Mail and a representative of POTUS asks for his help. The novel follows the hero's days as he races to complete his mission and show up the elitiest of American political circles.'Hey' Meehan is not part of a criminal network, as note to exist in the Dortmunder novels, but does manage to recuit help he needs to finish the job, find love and expose a Middle Eastern joint task force, whose cooperation would make the FBI and NYPD jealous.An enjoyable read and proberly a new charater for Westlake.Earlier books to read by Westlake include Up the Banner and Help I Am Being Held Prisoner. I would also recommend the 'Sullivan' books of Lawrence Sanders."
2,Strange,I do not like this game because its hard depressing and not fun. As wario you look for lost treasure beat bad guys so on. Bosses super hard THIS GAME IS FRUSTRATING!
4,Sure whatever kid.,This game looks and sounds like it will be the next big Nintendo game. If you liked the Wario Land series then you will probably love this. You get different hats that give you special abilities and you also get to swing enemies around in a 3d world. This will probably be more satisfying than Super Mario Sunshine is.
3,"short.. yeah, short..","I rented this game some time ago, and I'm slightly surprised by the high ratings. I consider it pretty average. It looks pretty good, and it's amusing, but I beat it with 100% completion the first time through. It was very, very short. I rented it and returned it early.. so it took less than 2 days to beat it. The mini games you unlock are fun 2-3 times. They can't actually be beaten. You just keep playing a circle of strange little games that get harder and harder till there's no way to pass the level.All in all.. I'd rent it, beat it, return it. Not a whole lot of replay value. Not a bomb, but no worth buying. Thusly, the average 3 stars."
4,Does it have to be hard?,"I really did not know what to expect from this game. I have heard that it was easy and so far thus be the case. I do not think that a game has to be hard to be a good game. I was pleased with the graphics in this game and story behind it. I had to smile when I heard Wario say ""have a rotten day"" after throwing his enemy out of sight. I have never seen Mario throw an opponent during his adventures, and I do not wish too. With Wario's character the role fit nicely and even had a humorous side. I would recommend this game to anyone."
3,very fun but gets killed shortly (im a kid),this game rocks! levels are filled with enememies continously comin and trust me beating them up is funny and fun. you can ground pound the seemingly idiotic baddies and laugh along side with ur friends. u can pile drive them yes its a wrestling move. u can throw them off the stage or spin them to kill other enemies or activate stuff. a tottally wacky game with enviroment that is cool. tons of collecting and smashing. also great for wario hes in 3D. although at the end of the day its just another collecting. and is very short it can be beat in about 3 hours. because of that i cannot reccomend you should buy it just rent. but if its for a child or your a serious fan get it. still its short.
5,Fun and Enternaining,"This game like MarioWorld is very much fun to play and recommend it to all who remember enjoying Super Mario Bro., just don't forget to purchase a memory card, you will want to save this game."
3,What a freak!,"The graphics aren't the best with a tendency towards repetition, but the right effects and touches have been utilized to create varied environments, including staples like snow, desert, circus and jungle. Wario's animations are spot-on, and each of the weird enemies really captures the oddity of the world. I think the game would have really looked sharp if they opted for more of a claymation feel ?some of the creatures look halfway there already.The music plays up the action nicely and the sound effects are deliciously evil, with Wario singing nah-na-na-nah-nah during the paused screens, plus plenty of Wario outbursts left and right.Wario is a strangely endearing lug. It comes through in his goofy walk and his inexplicable self-confidence. I mean, here he is, ugly as sin, yet he still struts his stuff. Wario World is equally goofy and strange, but in an unassuming way, it's also good, unpretentious fun."
2,What a rotten game.,"Watio World is effectively a throwback to the 16-bit era of 2D side scrolling platfomers. Unfortunately, it is not a patch on any of them. The emphasis is on tedious button bashing. Instead of quickly dispatching your enemies as Sonic might do with a quick bounce on the head, gland-challenged Wario has to knock seven bells out of them first, which makes the pace slow. With the much better Viewtiful Joe out on the shelves, Wario World is the worse platform beat-em-up by far. Strangely, its' fans seem to really like it. I can only think that they haven't played Streets of Rage or indeed any 2D platformer of the Megadrive/SNES era."
5,took 10 minutes to install,Very easy to install the hardest part was removing the old air box. the new one goes right in with all the parts needed included in the box.
2,NOT step-by-step,"Well, the book has gotten great reviews and all by people that know a lot about the subject apparently. As a novice I do have to warn you, this is NOT the book to learn C++ self-tought or on an Online environment. It just gives you definition after definition (although very well described), then some examples and that is it. It does not take you by the hand and teaches you how to write a program, a method, so you start to understand the thought process behind it all. I suppose that if you know C++ you get to appreciate this book a lot more. But if you already know C++ then any book is fine."
5,I used this as a college text...,"The first two computer science courses at Seattle University use this text. Learning C++ was a breeze with this book. It covers classes, variables, loops, user defined types, and much more. The examples are great, better yet it's readable, and I dare say it's sometimes humourous. :)"
4,Great for beginning...,"I've taken two classes using this book at Ohio University. The book was great at the beginning, but I relied on it less and less, until I was only using it as an occasional reference. I think it's a good way to start, but once you're more comfortable with the language you might want Stroustrup's book or some sort of concise reference."
5,Savitch's C++: Clear Plus Concise Plus Comprehensive,"Geared towards beginner with no prior programming knowledge, this book teaches the fundamentals of the C++ language in a way that is extremely easy to read yet is very comprehensive. Savitch's down-to-earth style doesn't attempt to impress the reader with overly complex examples or ambiguously stated text. The book was designed to give the reader a solid understanding of the basic programming skills involved with C++ and does just that in a clear, concise manner. The book includes questions and answers along with suggested programming projects designed to sharpen skills."
5,This book is a must-have,"The best way to get into programming is to have this book, it's easy, well designed, you can even read it any where... just do one thing: go and buy this book and start your PC and you will be a programmer."
2,This book is outdated,"My intro CS class used this book. I don't care for it myself. He uses outdated (pre ISO Standard) methods to teach C++, although the book was written after the Standard was published. I also have the book ""C++ An Introduction to Computing"" ISBN # 0137443927 which I think does a much better job. So if you are not required to use this book, look elsewhere."
5,Excellent introduction to programming!,"Well, finally I found it! The one and only book I needed to learn how to program. And believe me, I've tried a few. The main reason I love this book, is because it's not only a C++ book. It's also a book that teaches you how to think to be able to write programs (in any language). It delivers what it is supposed to deliver; the knowledge on how to program, in C++. On top of all this, you also get to know some of the really cool obscurities of computers and programming, like the origin of the ""bug"". Buy it, read it and vote for it. It deserves every star it could possibly get!"
4,a good place to start...,"... but it's really annoying that a new edition (the 4th) appeared so quickly on its heels.There's a lot to like about Savitch's thorough presentation. I must admit I find his prose more suited to an oral hearing than a reading; he just gets a bit too cute at times. That, I admit, might show my generation gap-py away! I do find the graphics miles ahead of his Java book and the earlier C++ books. The programming examples are excellent, and the self-tests are great. What I would like, if the publishers are into popping out new editions, is solutions to a few of the more complicated programming challenges at the end of the chapters."
5,Excellent undergraduate text,"I have looked over a good number of C++ books for several of the undergraduate courses I teach. The wrong introduction can turn students off a language for life. Finding an introductory book with just the right pitch and level of difficulty is difficult. Savitch's book seems to fit my needs in this respect. It is accessible, readable and the examples are clear enough for students to work through without having to look over their shoulders continuously. yes, it is a litle on the wordy side, but it is a small defect overall. If you will continue to use C++, Savitch is a firm foundation for moving on to other more advanced texts. The bottom line is that you have to start somewhere in learning programming and this is as good as I have seen in C++."
1,BAD BUY,These protectors do jack squat literally. They made my cards even worse. One time they were stuck to the cards.(wth??)When I finally got my cards out all of them were ruined and they were valuable cards too!!
2,OK For Kids I Guess,"This game reminds me of the movies that Disney used to make years ago. Pirates, buried treasure, villains, boy, girl, smart parrot. That's about it. The graphics are good. Sound is fine. Puzzles are mostly of the inventory type, except the last puzzle which requires you to decipher Mayan symbols and push many buttons. This puzzle may take as long to solve as playing the rest of the game.While this is not a bad game, I doubt that it will hold the interest of many adults."
4,Destination-Treasure Island,"It's a good game- treasure after treasure, but little too easy, my grand son more enjoy it than me I still think should more deeper."
1,Waste of $10,"I couldn't get the game to install on either my new Windows 7 gaming laptop, or on my older 2006 Windows XP PC. The installation repeatedly failed during the final portion of installation from disc 1. Both my laptop and PC have a GeForce graphics card (but different versions). I have zero interest in installing a game in safe mode from Worse yet, while researching on Google, I discovered I could buy this game on BigFish for $4.99 (normally $6.99 but on special at the time). It downloaded with no problem. Wish I would have gone there right from the start."
4,Great game! Kids loved it too!,We really liked this game. It was short but not too short and easy enough that the kids could figure it out without me. It was humorous and the helps during the game kept it moving along.
1,Not able to play,"I was able to load this game all right only when I went to play the game it would not display any titles or script, and some parts of the first puzzle were not displayed eather. I went on their web site and discovered it was a known problem with some graphic cards. They pointed out you needed to eather update your display card or turn off somthing I was never able to find in my contral panel. I tried to update my display card, which didn't have any updates, and after much looking & fooling around with my hardware, and messing up some of my settings, I gave up.I'm runing XP on a Pentium 4 with 2394MHz and 512MB memory. My display card is a NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 440. The display card they listed on their web site was also a NVIDIA GeFroce but a stightly different number. If you have a NVIDIA GeForce display card I would suggest you do not buy this game as you may not be able to play it."
1,Horrendous,"Absolutely terrible. By far and away the worst movie I have ever seen. It is very difficult to even put into words how poor this film really is, you are better off renting it from your local library(so you don't waste your money) and seeing the horribleness for yourself."
1,Worst. movie. ever.,"Don't be fooled by the cover. This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. The production budget was probably $3, and the movie looks like it was made for $2. Every aspect of this movie is terrible from the script, acting, lighting, dialog, sound and music. It looks like they put more effort into making the DVD cover than the movie. The main ""actor"" is terrible, and sadly he is also the director. Apparently no one told him the movie was so terrible because he was the boss. I don't want to waste another second of my life even thinking about this piece of junk."
1,Don't Even Think About It,"I'm a horror buff and that's why I bought this let me see oh yea pile of crap waste of plastic and paper DVD.To give it away on purpose to save you $7. or so.One,The acting is very very bad.Two,The fight scenes look very very fake at points of impact from punches,kicks,etc. and the following sound effects of impact even worse.Three,I't has about 30 chapters and turned it off after 3rd thats how bad it is.I originally bought it to shed some light of curiosity of those horrible Juarez,Mexico murders of women if it's a cult,cartel,etc. but it's back to google for more information.Don't even think about it."
3,Ok movie,"Well, I would say that this is not the best movies that I've watched, but I think that the drama is good, it is only that the actors weren't that graet, and maybe there was a better way to send the message of this film to the public.*Sponsored Post"
1,Low Budget Travesty,"I watch at least two films a day; its a passion and an obsession. Most of my favs are of the horror/thriller/mystery variety. Being a junkie for these kind of flicks, I pre-ordered Juarez given its deep history and vast possibilities.All I can say is, this is absolutely, one of the worst ""films"" I have ever seen someone put out. Unbelievably bad acting, sound, cinematography, dialogue...everything is the utmost worst you can imagine. Assuming you need to see every movie released in a year, watch this. Otherwise, save your dough, save your time, and steer clear of this dog. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Brutally bad..."
1,Poor belt case,"the case makes the phone too hard to go in and out, when trying to get it out while on your belt it's almost certain that u will drop the phone. this case should be a sleeve not a case for the hip."
2,unusable for iPhone 4 (S),"This case is huge for the iPhone 4. The length and width are perfect, but the two panels are too far apart to hold the phone in. There's about an extra 5mm's of space (about half the width of the iPhone 4, extra), which even for the 3G would make it too big. This makes it basically usable as the phone falls out quite easily. Also the belt clip is junk, and I wouldnt bet on it staying put for very long. For the price I suppose it's difficult to complain about, but this case is near useless. The generally quality aside from the belt clip is decent, and I like the mesh at the bottom to allow you to hear sounds from the phone; just wish it would actually hold the phone in."
2,Too tight for iPhon,This case is too tight for iPhone and need to put a lot of effort just slip in and pull out the phone from this case. I stopped using it after a day!
1,poor quality,"I purchased one of these - within a week the stitching was coming apart and the faux leather on the belt clip seperated exposing the metal clip itself. This was after nominal/normal use.In short, very poor quality construction..."
1,Not Worth Getting,"This case has shown itself to be a pain in a couple of ways. The first is the designs let in the screen after the iphone was stored in the case. The fingerprints, after being rubbed off, leave a residue on the phone. This case then paces designs on the touch screen area that can sometimes be difficult to remove and can get pretty annoying. This is caused by the pointless diamond designs printed on the inside of the case. The second issue I have with the case is that it holds the phone too tightly. The black plastic piece on the bottom back of the phone can begin to come loose just from removing the phone from the case and reinserting it. This has moved me to purchase a casing that covers my entire phone to prevent it from falling apart."
1,Belkin F8Z169 Slim-Fit Case for iPhone,"is the worst investment I ever have made. it get broken in the first week of normal use, of and executive person."
4,"Great case, a few flaws","This is a nice case, the leather quality is decent, and it does the job. There's not much I can say that others haven't. However, I will warn you: the case is quite snug initially, so that the only way to get your iPhone out of the case is to push the bottom of the case to push the iPhone out. The problem is, the bottom of the case has a wire mesh, which WILL scuff up the bottom part of your iPhone a little.Other than that, I do like the case better than most I've seen on the market."
1,Watch Out,"This is a nice slim option for carrying your phone, but beware of the flimsy belt clip. It easily slips off and can result in a lost phone. It happened twice to me before pitching it into the garbage."
1,"If you care for your Iphone, do not buy.","I'm very dissapointed in this case. I bought it and the 3rd day of use, the belt clip detached from the case and it (along with my iPhone) fell to the ground.Now I have a dent on my phone on the top corner where it is not protected. I trusted Belkin's products but not anymore. I thought $30.00 would be sufficient to protect my $500 phone but aparently it is not. Go elsewhere. I went back to using my Cozip case.If I could give this case a 0 out of 5 I would."
1,Poorly constructed,"I have used these types of holders on previous phones and was hoping this one would turn out the same however it was not to be. The belt clip came fell off after a month as I was walking through a parking lot. The tension on the elastic part that holds the phone stretched out so the phone would easily fall out. The stitching that attaches the bottom mesh started to come undone. This all started within a month or so of using! Piece of junk, save your money and get something else."
1,Not well made,The clip on the case broke the second day I used it. The clip appears to be glued onto the case in between the leather and the lining. The clip now slides off the case making the case useless for clipping on a belt.
1,Cologne,This was one of the worst experiences of my life it was handled by a third-party with very negative results. Mhg
5,Classic Jackie!,"I read the book within a couple hours, it is classic Jackie Collins with interesting characters & multiple storylines. My only complaint is that it reads as if it is the first few chapters of her usual novels, however, the ""mini series"" technique will involve quite a different investment! I'm anxious to see how much time evolves between books. You know how frustrating it is when you're in the middle of a good read & you can't find your book, or you forgot it? Well, welcome to L.A. Connections!!"
3,Predictable but the ending got me hooked!,This part of the series was predictable but the ending made me want to read the next one. It's very short it only took me like 2 hours to read. Very light reading. So I guess If I were you I'd just get the collector's edition of L.A. Connections that way you won't have to keep going to the library or buying the next book in the series. I wonder if the 2nd one is good...........
2,An Unexpected Short Ghost Story,"I had just bought a real 1928 Austin Seven car and was buying every book on the subject. I did not notice that this was a fictional story about a haunted Austin Seven. Nevertheless,the book is an engaging short story about a haunted 1928 Austin Seven. A good quick read for Austin Seven fans or people who enjoy a good short story. Unfortunately, the cover photo is not a 1928 Austin Seven saloon (sedan), as described in the story, it is a later open car with a special body by Swallow (later to become Jaguar)."
5,AMAZING DVD!!,"Without going into a lot of detail, let me just say that the talent and quality of the DVD are superb! If you like Santana and/or Jazz, this DVD is for you!"
1,USB DRIVERS,"I purchased the Entrega UPG-PCI-2U USB Upgrade 2-Port and it didn't come with a driver. I need to know where I can download the driver for the port. If you can send it on a floppy disk, I would greatly appreciate it. I rated this product with a 1 star because I haven't been able to use it yet."
2,low budget review,"This CD shows the mastery and potential of being a great piece of work, but with static and distortion, this takes away from being CD quality. The compositions are great."
1,Major Dissapointment,"I was really looking forward to this release-what a dissapointment to find it had the EXACT SAME SONG SELECTION as the ""Crazy Cajun"" recordings, already in release.The sound quality is poor and the songs are NOIT country- instead, we are ""treated"" to some sort of ""Pseudo-soul"" music.This set is terrible.I do reccomend ""The Essential Ronnie Milsap"" available at Amazon at a great price, and BJ Thomas's ""Crazy Cajun"" recordings- two true winners.Avoid this one."
3,Good for what it's worth...,"Good quality, just about what I expected. Very imaginative storyline and erotica. Not many extra special features (e.g. commentary, interviews, previews) but a must have if all your looking for is the picture itself."
2,Cool but noting special.,"For al the fuss that was made over this film decades ago, I expected a lot more and was slightly disappointed by what I saw. This doesn't quite hold up to other adult film classics, like ""Debbie Does Dallas"" and ""Deep Throat"". It's decent at best. Borrow, but don't buy."
1,Rip Off,"Started video and it played for about 20-25 minutes, then quit. It appeared to be on pause mode and would not continue. Attempted several times to restart and play again with the same results. Total rip off!!!"
2,Ehh...,"It wasn't that great. I like vintage porn, but I do not think it was that remarkable. I probably will not watch it again."
4,Love it!!! Can't wait for the movie!,"We purchased this set as a Christmas gift for our 7 year old daughter. The dagger, scabbard and vial are made of a nice really hard plastic that will last. The vial and the scabbard have a belt clip. The vial has glitter inside. The only cheap part of this set is the cape which is made of cheap felt but enjoyable nonetheless! This is a great colorful, life-like set for your little Lucy and will bring hours of imaginary play!"
5,Lucy playset,"My (...) daughter loves this toy! Both my girls have read the complete Chronicles of Narnia and are very much into role playing. This is the perfect set to enhance their play. The Edmund's sword and shield is also excellent, but hard to find. I highly recommend this for any young girl that wants to be just like Lucy! Great fun!"
2,"no gapless play on mp3s, Beware. ineradicable gaps between tracks that should be connected","I think the title of this review says it all. These are wonderful performances, it's just that Amazon's mp3s have ineradicable gaps between tracks, which fouls up the listening experience in the 6th symphony especially. This is an endemic problem on Amazon."
3,Couldn't possibly achieve all it attempts,"This is a bold attempt by the author to weave magic and history, and it ultimately fails, although it was probably worth the effort. Doesn't quite get where he wants us to go, but it's a fun trip, anyhow.Much of the book is based on Michael Lesy's ""Wisconsin Death Trip,"" an historical record of life, death, and madness in Northern Wisconsin at the end of the 19th century. Lesy's book succeeds where Jones fails, simply by letting the events and Schaik's remarkable photographs stand on their own. There is no need to resort to the supernatural-reality is more than bizarre enough."
5,Rod Jones,I've written my thesis about this author. I would like to meet other people all over the world interedted in Rod Jones.
5,Excellent Blades,"These are pretty nice and effective blades than the old wiper blades, I would highly recommend these."
4,Who are America's Favorite Disfunctional Family?,Are you a huge Simpsons fan? Do you watch Jeopardy! every day? Can you answer in the form of a question? Then this is the game you've been waiting for! Enjoy -- Good Luck!
2,"Just ""OK""","I did not revert to my youthful, hormone laden woman I used to be. I actually just took some tablets, and then I was out, and that was that. Very anti-climatic results for a run-of-the-mill product. You can buy these herbal tabs at Walgreens and probably obtain the same non-results for a lot less money."
4,a fun toy for a 5-year old,"My son loves this toy - of course, at the moment he's a rabid Spider-man fan so he loves all things that have Spider-man image on them; but this is still his favorite. It's pretty sturdy, easy to play with; not much of an ""educational value,"" to be sure - but we weren't planning on that, either! Overall, I would have probably purchased it again."
2,Broke within a week :(,"Bought this toy for my son (who is 4) for christmas. He was thrilled. After playing with it exactly 3 times, the toy broke. He can still play with the spiderman that comes on and off the bike though... However, the wheels on it are garbage. Rating this a overall 2 only because he can still play with the action figure, but its very poor quality."
2,Barely average even for the home workworker,"I've owned this router table for a couple of years now and have used it on a regular basis for various projects. The adapter plate came in handy for mounting different routers which is good.The bad...The screws on the legs come loose frequently and the whole table is very unstable which leads to chatter even when making slow passes. The fence lock down handles don't allow enough space between themselves and the fence to get a good grip in order to secure the fence. Even if you could, the nuts on the underside of the table only sit in plastic guides which wore out quickly so the fence moves while working causing (of course) very inaccurate work.It is also very hard to change out bits which leads to a lot of wasted time in the shop.I am now planning on spending a bit more money to get a stable, well-made table."
5,Cheaper than the real thing...,"I have yet to find anything that this wouldn't do in regards to your typical financial calculator. Add in some bonuses such as a more visual, intuitive approach to dealing with TVM and Cash Flows and this is a much better (and cheaper) choice for HandSpring owners than buying an HP calculator."
1,Taking so long to shipped,"2 weeks allready and they didn't send it, I dont know whats the problem, because I need it for now"
1,Old News,"Rohit Ramaswamy has presented us with a dinosaur view of how to manage service processes. It reflects the old ""inside-out"" view of service management, which is now widely discredited by leading service managers. Hence the emphasis on widespread internal metrics and the operations orientation. True attention to service implies driving the company's service offering from the outside-in, and is keyed by customer satisfaction measurement rather than operational measures."
1,"This is not stretch, it's more LOW impact aerobics.","At first I thought the tape didn't match the box! This is fast moving, more very low impact aerobic style. I wish I hadn't bought it."
4,A good stretching routine with mild aerobics,"I like to use this video on stressed-out days. Scott Cole says some unusual mystic-type stuff about ""healing power."" I try to ignore that and enjoy the stretching. Flexibility is important when you work out every day. This is a nice break from my more hard-core workouts."
5,Michael : Angelic Communication,"Great Examples and stories from the past and present , also how to call upon Angels for help . Nicole Author Rainy Day Poems and more 1 and 2"
1,Readers Beware,"Catholic and all traditionally Christian readers should know that this bookencourages un-Christian practices such as candle magic, crystals, and dreamwork.It is more of a New Age work than an orthodox work of Christian theologyor spirituality. That is simply an honest assessment that buyers need to be aware of.Those looking for traditional Christian understandings should look elsewhere.TAN Books and Publishers has a nice mini-book with some solid history of devotionto Michael the Archangel and prayers."
1,Not at all what I wanted,"I had this book for quite some time, before I had a chance to read it. It is not ANYTHING I would want in my home. Never had I been taught that St. Michael, the Archangel would communicate with those of us on earth by using, ""The magic power of Candles,"" ""Crystals,"" ""Chakras,"" and other various ways. I will remember not to purchase any book by Richard Webster again. His version of how to communicate with St. Michael will collect dust in the corner of a junk closet."
4,Tommy Lee gettin it done!,"Good stuff! Kid Rock's guest rap is excellent of course! Snoop Dog & Limp Bizkit were great add-ins too! Lil Kim sounds as good as she looks (Girl you are fly! I mean, DAMN!) But this isn't ALL about that. This is about Tommy Lee asserting himself with his own sound (much like Kid Rock did) and it works - VERY well in fact!"
1,TRASH,ONE WORD SUMS IT UP: TRASH.There's tons of good music out there and I just happened to pick the worst. My bad. I threw it away yesterday.LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY.
1,Why Tommy Why?,"One of metal greatest drummers, becomes a trendy Nu-Metaller, how sad. Hold out for the new Crue, forget this rap/metal/garbage hybrid!"
1,this has got to be a joke,"I'm glad I didn't buy this cd. I heard it from a friend. This is nothing but hip-hop and rap. I was expecting some sort of...hmmm, I guess it's called rock and roll. Something that Tommy Lee is usually known for. I guess he must have picked up a Snoopy The Dog cd last year and this is what he came out with. I can't believe he gave up Motley Crue for this. This cd is an insult to longtime Motley Crue fans. I have nothing against musicians wanting to explore a little, but this is ridiculous. It remined me of Paradise Lost trying to sound like Depeche Mode on their lastest cd. Only get this cd if you're a fan of hip hop music like Limp Bizkit, Britney Spears, Korn, Kid Rock, or Backstreet Boys. If your a rock and roll fan, don't even bother with this cd."
2,"Recount of other's journeys, how useful?","This book is an anthropologist's recount of her and a group of her friends' lives. It demonstrates the artfulness and creativity required to compose a life in today's ever-changing world. Then again, these women made these life altering decisions in the past ... how relevant is their journey to that of young women today?"
4,Inviting Life to Get in the Way,"How refreshing - a book about 5 entrepreneurial women who had 'normal' lives - marriages, children, divorce, earning an advanced degree in their 40's! This is real life - and each of the stars in this book invited life to get in the way rather than lamenting how life's events prohibited achievement of dreams, goals and aspirations.A great read for every woman contemplating her future!Susan BockBusiness CoachSusan Bock Solutions[...]"
4,"Five Women of Vision, Creativity and Intelligence","The author examines how five women of intelligence, creativity and vision composed their lives.Bateson discusses the traditional ways of viewing life as a single uninterrupted strand from beginning to end. Instead of viewing life this way, she chooses to define life's journey as enriched by tangents, change and rerouting. She makes the case that women's work has prepared them for this. Women cook, read, pursue professional goals, raise families - - all at the same time. Women are eclectic and are accustomed to being up-rooted.Bateson sees the new age as one that requires this kind of preparedness and skill. She discusses how derailment usually can be viewed as beneficial whereas traditional views stress certainty and defined continuity. This is an interesting thesis and she has chosen interesting women to make her point. Parts of the book are repetitive but, overall, it is very interesting and thought-provoking"
1,"""waaaaaaaaaack""","This CD gets 1 star for the simple fact that it has 5 good songs, that's it!! Those are are trks. 2,4,7,9 &10. rest is garbage."
5,The Single-Disc Version of Their Greatest Hits,"This does not include the remix disc, and it's better that way. Nothing to complain about! The 20 song selection is perfect with two exceptions - no room for Life Becoming a Landslide and Ocean Spray. There's only one selection from The Holy Bible, but that's as it should be - that album is a separate entity that needs to be listened to in its entirety! So this is the more pop/rock (not punk/metal) side of the MSPs - which is not a bad thing. The music and lyrics are terrific! And they've included the elusive Suicide is Painless and Motown Junk! A pretty much perfect collection of political rock n roll from the great Manics! You NEED this!"
2,Pretty Bad,"I found myself questioning whether such a character couldactually exist in the real world. The main character hadsuch extreme shifts in mood, thought processes, concerns,and morality that she seemed better suited for an institution.And in the end, you are expected to believe that she will livehappily ever after."
2,Not really for someone trying to learn the game,"I bought this book mostly on the recommendations of the other readers here. But I have been disappointed with this book. I was hoping for more strategies and methods of winning poker. I understand this is a complex game and Andy Nelson does provide some good insights. But as a beginner, I needed a more basic book with techniques I could use. Also, this book uses some jargon that only more experienced players will understand. Maybe after I master more of the game, I'll reread this book and see if it offers more help."
4,Pretty Good Book,"This was my first poker book. I had Just started to play in a casino. but knew i was missing something. This book enlightened me as to what to look for, It was a good book for me to start with Not overly technical and Pretty easy to read. gave me the basics"
2,Merely interesting,"This book contains some interesting thoughts and lessons for serious poker players. However, David Sklansky's ""The Theory of Poker"" is clearly superior, and essential to the aspiring player."
3,"The book was quick, but I learned more while actually in Gettysburg","I rated this book at a 3 because it was short and to the point, which I liked, but I also would have enjoyed more detail. I know that contradicts each other. What I mean is that at the end of the day, I would have enjoyed a book that was longer that really told me more about the battle, but since I didn't get that, then I'm glad that it was short. I have visisted Gettysburg many times and truthfully have leared more while there than I did in this book. I guess I expected more detail as to what it was like to see the battle occurring right outside your window. The book was good in that she told you about friends she made with soldiers and since she stayed at a different location than her family, you got a nice look at what it was like in both towns, but really at the end of the day, there is not much in this book that is really worth reading. The one thing it did have going for it is that it was a fast, easy read."
5,Good Film,"I caught an an advance screener for this film and really enjoyed it. Being a bit ambivalent on the existence of heaven, hell and god myself, I could relate to Nick's surprise at his predicament."
4,Disciplined Democracy,"The author's central argument is that product liability lawsuits are an essential vehicle for enabling citizens to impose societal values on powerful corporations. The market can't do this because the profit motive can encourage corporate behavior that unfairly imposes business's costs on the public. Government regulation is often hamstrung by the pressures powerful competing interests bring to bear on the political process. But, combined with important safeguards built into the judicial process, juries bring diverse life experiences, societal mores, and a gut-level sense of fairness to important issues that impact citizens' lives. The common law enables the community to extract information from hard-to reach places and to provide a democratic check on the powerful. I would say the author made his case."
5,GOOD UNIT FOR THE $$$$,"The unit works great, can't beat the price. Only thing is that you will need an extra key in the device."
1,Universal bypass not so universal,"This ""Universal"" bypass was not universal enough to work on my 2004 Truck. Thankfully the company that installed my remote start took it in on trade."
5,Tempts 'Gettin Ready',"A perfect collection for anyone who loves the ""Classic Five"" Temptations. There are several goodies on this cd... including a couple that feature the yummy, soulful baritone of the late great Paul Williams."
4,A great album,"This was the Temps at their best. Plenty of great hits on this one.Listen to ""Not Now, I'll Tell You Later."" Worth buying for this tune alone. Talk about a song that should have been a number one hit!!!"
5,Classic Soul,"'Gettin' Ready' is one of my favorite Temptation lp's! This Lp is just classic Motown Soul, featuring the big hits 'Get Ready', 'Ain't To Proud To Beg', 'Fading Away'.. also two of my favorite Paul Williams leads on 'Lonely, Lonely Man Am I' love the background hamories on this song! and 'Who You Gonna Run To' and Eddie's joyful lead on 'Too Busy Thinking About My Baby', and David on 'Say You' i've always felt that this song is underrated in the Temps catalog, I just love it. This cd includes two bonus tracks, This lp marked a turning point for the Temps because 'Get Ready' didn't hit the tep ten on the pop charts Berry Gordy felt it wasn't a hit(GR was a #1 R&B hit) so Smokey Robinson was no longer the main producer for them and the Norman Whitfield years began, (personally I like alot of the Norman productions but the Smokey years are my favorites) no soul collection should not be without this wonderful set of songs."
5,Precious Memories,"What can I say? Thier 4th album on the Gordy label and it get's better. I was only [...] and remember going over to my oldest sisters house and hearing ""Fading Away"" blasting from the 2nd story window. ""Fading Away"" was a bigger hit in DC more than ""Get Ready"". My favorite is ""Lonley Lonely Man Am I"". Paul really can pour his soul out. This overall is a great album. As one review put it, this was the transition album. Paul is not leading the majority of the songs and Smokey Robinson passed the production torch to Norman Whiffield who took the Temps to another level. The ""Distinguished Gentleman"" as I call them were the best male group of thier era. My two all time favorite male groups ""the Spaniels"" and of course the ""Temptations"". IF you love the Temps, get this cd."
5,LOVED THIS CD!!!!,"All the tracks on this CD are great--I had the vinyl album back when it first came out--but moving from Connecticut to New York back in 1968 plus playing the album over and over just wore it out. I am so glad this was issued in CD form. ""You""re Not An Ordinary Girl"" should have been a single. It reminds me so much of ""Aint That Peculiar"". I loved David Ruffin singing ""Say You"", he kept the soul going way past the fade!!!"
2,Doesn't last,This might be fine for an occasional user for sharpening a kitchen knife. But if you intend to use for mower blades and tools I would buy it. Get a Norton stone. Like a Norton India Oil Stone.
2,cheap stone yall,"cheap stone, cheap price so thats fair but i hated paying for the damn shipping yall, but it came it one piece, one side was a litte bigger and it wobbled if you layed it flat, but thats fine yall"
2,Arrived broken,"This sharpening stone was about what one expected. Except, it came in two parts instead of a usable one piece. :-(It was a little more coarse than I expected. I got it to sharpen a machete, and unfortunately (probably due to my lack of skill and technique) I made it worse.So, all in all, it was a failure. But, hey, the price was right!"
5,Simple and effective sharpening stone,"The product works as described. Shipped promptly. All the packaging is in Chinese, so don't expect any instructions. The price for this product is great. Would recommend to to others in need of a simple stone to sharpen pocket knives, kitchen knives and such."
1,You get what you pay for.,"i had this on my wish list for a couple of weeks and when i saw it on sale, i was pretty excited. but when i finally got it, it came cracked right in half. i would have to start from the cracked half down t get an even edge."
3,It's cheap,"As my title says, it's cheap. I received it with a big chunk broken off on one end due to the crappy job of packing. It came in a small box, but was then packed in a larger box without any padding to stabilize the contents...stupid. That being said, it works as it should, it sharpens dull knives."
3,ok sharpening stone,Not the best I bought but did the trick in sharpening my knifes. The stone fell apart as I sharpened my last knife.
3,It's alright,I couldn't get a knife sharp with this stone. When it arrived it had a chip out of the side of it but that didn't effect it. It's probable the user more than the stone that makes a knife sharp.
2,Not worth it,You get what you pay for..don't expect this to last long if you use it every week. I used it with water after I saw a lot of dust and it was made debris. I also bought the diamond that was also cheap..er and I think it will outlast this thing. I haven't used any lubeon the diamond The diamond is half the thickness. Both made over seas. I guess it will work but idk I already used the diamond first and was pleased.
1,Dont buy it!!! Not a good product,I got this one a week ago and tried it on my knives. I ended up buying another sharper the day after I received this stone. Just not working on my knives at all. The stone keeps losing sand. I have shopped a lot from Amazon and this is the first time I am not happy with the product. Just a piece of garbage for me
1,Spend more $ for something that works,Save your money. This product is junk. You cant even tell which side is 120 or 240 grit. When you rub your hand over the stone it just crumbles. When you run your knife over the stone it crumbles. This product is already in the trash after one week of use. very disappointing.
1,Not so sharpa stone,"The sharpening stone arrived in fine condition. I started using the stone and it just started desolvimg under the knife blade. The more I used it, the more it came apart. Sent it to the trash. I do not recommend it."
1,Arrived broken,"This item arrived broken and unusable. Waste of money. Find something else to use to sharpen your knives, you wont like this."
1,Junk.. Plain and simple,Don't wast your money on something like this. Save and get a quality sharpening stone. This just isn't worth the hassle.I am completely unsatisfied with this stone. You can barely tell which side is the 240 or the 120. Either way after attempting to use what you think might me the grit side; it become the fine side after a few strokes anyway. 100% J-U-N-K.. But if you make the mistake of purchasing this thing anyway then I think the lighter side is the 120(gritty) and the dark might be 240(fine).. But don't make the mistake in the first place..
4,great book,This is a wonderful book that can be used to teach students how to write an opinion writing piece. I am glad to have found a copy at Amazon.
5,Love it,"I realy love this book! And my 6 yr old son too, everything was as described. Will recommend to buy for your kids"
4,Wonderful book,My son had done a project and his teacher read the book to the classroom. He wanted the book so I found it for him.
5,11 years later and still phenomenal,"I purchased this album as a sophomore in high school, around the time when I was very eager to soak up as much knowledge of classical works and composers as possible. Because of this interest, I bought a lot of compilation albums, most of which I now view as trite, hackneyed, even. At the time, they were a great and inexpensive learning tool for me. However, this album has been a solid rock in my life for over 11 years, now; and I still relish in its indescribable beauty, often. Please do yourself a favor and get this album. It's been one of the few albums I have put on every single iPod, laptop, and phone I've had, throughout the years. Hats off to the producer who selected this wonderful variety of well-known to unheard-of works that has changed my life!"
4,Classical Dreams: Music to Inspire,The music and performance was excellent. The only negative element is the volume is too low. When I play it in a sequence of other similar CD's it is too soft and I have to adjust the volume control.
5,1984 World Series,"High-priced, but worth it for all the behind-the-scenes footage that's included.Brought back fond memories of the second World Series that I ever watched.I was eleven years old at the time!!!!"
4,Sonecor headset/hands free telephones,"I work for a Virtual Call Center, and a hands-free telephone is a must. This has proven to be THE most reliable equipment I have found. Features such as volume control, flexibility of the headset and mute button are wonderful. The only drawback that I can find is the headset is fragile. My equipment doesn't get proper care, (too many cats) and the headset doesn't last as it should. The dial pad will wear forever. I highly reccomend (sp?) this set. Just be careful with the junction of the microphone and the headset itself, that plastic piece breaks easily."
4,Slashing critique of a consulting firm and client,"Soldiers of Fortune 500 takes Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) and Nationsbank (now Bank of America) to task for spending too much money on an ineffective information technology program. Romaine expands this personal story (in which he partook as a consultant too) to condemn the consulting industry in general. If only the consultants and clients listed were able to defend themselves...The subject is germane today, but the book has not stood the test of time. Perhaps intended as the Liar's Poker of the consulting industry, it ends a more specific diatribe against the parties listed."
4,Definitely a worthwhile read!,"This is a ""must read"" for any consultant and more importantly any one who works with or hires consultants. From my perspective (as a finance professor) perhaps the book's greatest benefit is that Romaine lays out a rarely talked about conflict within the nexus of contracts: the shareholder vs. the consultant. While not necessarily always opposed to each other, the consultant has a much shorter time horizon and hence differing incentives. Given the fact that incentives matter, the book is a good introduction to an overlooked conflict that is worthy of future academic research.oh and it is interesting too! :)Jim Maharhttp://www.financeprofessor.com"
3,Response to Previous Review,"To correct a previous ""reviewer,"" as author of Soldier of Fortune 500, I have received numerous personal letters from college professors regarding the book. One stated it was ""a good resource for faculty and students."" A University President noted in his letter, ""the topic is both important and timely."" Another University President wrote, ""it is clear that your book offers a uniquely personal and in depth perspective of the perils and promise of management-consulting relationship."" Subsequently, as suggested by another, I sent emails to professors from select colleges who were teaching business management and / or who had published articles in this area. This was not a bulk email as previously suggested.Steve Romainewww.sof500.com"
5,Good size for the price.,This is one big stick of compound for the price you'd pay for a small sick at the store. Well worth it.
3,Not the correct compound for stropping a knife.,"Not the correct compound for stropping a knife on a leather strop. Once rubbed on the strop, the compound begins to slowly flake off as you strop the knife."
5,the music suits the movie,"I have not listened to entire CD, but I had the chance to see a special screening of the movie. The music completed the film. The kabuki drum would bang at the correct moments. The cello and the organ fit the movie perfectly. This soundtrack completed the already very sensual movie."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"Fell in love with this hauntingly beautiful music while watching the movie. Outstanding. Oftentimes, soundtracks sort of fade into the movie and are not memorable. The music added greatly to the ""feel"" of this movie. Especially, the emotional scenes. As one reviewer said, you will appreciate this music much more having seen the movie. Excellent!"
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big James Newton Howard fan, but I found this to be rather disappointing. Too loose, new age in style without the rich themes and scope JNH ususally brings to his film scores."
4,Good batteries.....,"I like Duracell batteries and I use them a lot for camping, for my biofeedback equipment, etc. They seem to last longer than anything else and I've never had one leak and ruin an expensive piece of electronic equipment.If you are ordering batteries online, be sure you are aware of shipping costs. They are quite heavy and therefore, expensive to ship. If you purchase online, then I would find out the shipping cost and buy in enough quantity that it's worth it."
2,The Enforcer kinda sucks,I got the enforcer drumset and it has bad cymbals and the highhats always fall out of place. my Wing Nut Broke when I screwed it on. it is a good drumset if you don't want to play any music and just Rap. The high tom communicates with my snare too much as well. I got ripped off. You could get a tama drumset for cheaper with better stuff for cheaper all you would need to do is get a Crash and ride seperate. oh yeah it doesn't come with a ride cymbal. after 6 months the cymbals are bending alot. The Giant E on the front makes it look like a joke. the reason it didnt get 1 tar from me is because it is the enforcer and it will kill you.
2,Brain Dead Comedy,"I swear, the briefcase switch is so old...It reminds me of an Hope and Crosby ""Road"" moviewith the leads having zero talent, singing or otherwise...The two stoners on the road has been doneand over done,and these two add nothing new to the mix."
1,Stone & Ed,"You think you cant go wrong on a stoner movie but boy they screwed this one up. Its like someone wanted to make a stoner movie that never smoked in there life. At best its a real real real bad rip off of ""dude wheres my car"" I say this cause it will kill your buzz if you watch it high.. So avoid this one at all costs"
2,ok,I am reading this book at the present moment and finding it slow in plot and not able to understand so of what is going on. It seem like the premise is good but lacks something at least for the moment.
5,Maybe S. Turnbull's BEST ever !!!,"This volume introduced me to the world of the Samurai, and author ""Turbull's"" vision of the Glory that was Japan's Diamyo (great names.) The illustration's compliment (without overpowering) the photo examples in a perfect blend that other, similar efforts just will not achieve. After collecting book after book that follows the story of feudal Japan -while seeing Mr.Turnbull grow in prestige and authority it is my own notion that this might have been the best blend of art, photography, page layout and overall written presentation that S.T. ever achieved.- If you own any other Turnbull ""Japan"" title- add this one to the collection it is a masterpiece. KS-"
4,title of review,"It's amazing how these guys can take a bunch of tired Ramones riffs and make songs that really have a life of their own. This record is catchy like the plague. I don't think it's as good as Born On The First Of July, so maybe buy that album first, but after a five year break between albums, and assuming I'd never hear anything new from these guys again, this album is a nice surprise, and a thoroughly worthwhile antidote to the pretentious cynical rock scene of 2005. It even has an audio commentary at the end, where they play the album a second time and talk over it."
4,a heavy duty hook,I wish the design of this hook were a bit nicer but it does the job. This is a very large and heavy duty hook that can be used for something like bag storage. I use it in the kitchen and inside my closet.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Empress is dead, and her successor must try and find a way to stay alive and solve the usual political problems. The twist is that the Imperial house types all have psychic abilities, which is what gives them their ruling class advantage.The inbreeding and problems with these Talents seems to make it hard for them to reproduce, so holding on to power is a trick."
3,Alternate history/Far Future,Imagine the Roman Empire didn't collapse and its empire grew to encompass the stars.
5,TEXTBOOK CHARLIE is great Should Trees Have Standing?,"Very informative book. It really makes you think. Also, TEXTBOOK CHARLIE is great, the book was in great condition for $2.00."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"I am a big fan of Stott Pilates Essential Matwork tapes - I recommend them to all of my Pilates students - but I find that I'd like to issue a BUYER BEWARE about these Stott programs. Every program I've viewed since purchasing the original DVD's are all the SAME EXERICES, the same warm-up breathing info that goes on way too long and takes up a big portion of the program, and that if you have the Essentials DVD's, you have most of what Stott has to offer on DVD at this time.I'd love to be able to return the new purchases, but if course cannot, now that they've been opened, but I feel that I have wasted my money on the possibility of pretty positions on covers that do not have anything to do with content."
3,GOOD RECS; SOME INCORRECT INFO THOUGH,"I found this book to have some good recommendations and it definitely offers a good idea of what San Antonio has to offer but there is plenty of incorrect information in the book as well (wrong addresses, wrong hours, wrong info, etc.). All in all a great place to start but information needs to be verified before acting upon."
4,Danni is on Fire!,"Danni Ashe is the most downloaded woman on the internet for good reason. Her short frame is all about sex! And this video, while far from being her best, does showcase her amazing breasts in several vignettes. There are other models in this video, but none to compare with Danni. If you're one of her legion of fans, buy this."
5,"Great Camera, Many Functions","This is a spectacular camera. It takes good pictures, has many options, and works great. It's so small and light weight that I take it everywhere with me to make sure I don't miss a shot. The price here on amazon.com is so low too, I reccommend buying it from here if you get it..."
5,"great translation, great notes","The Durling-Martinez edition is the one used in my college Dante class. Together with their translation of Purgatorio (their edition of Paradiso apparently still in progress), the two works have great endnotes for every canto of the poem, good appendices and Purgatorio has a series of 'intercantica' notes which refer the reader to all the parallels between the two works, so you don't have to remember that the Gates of Hell and the Gates of Purgatory are found in Canto 9 of their respective works.I wrote this review because the top reviews for this edition were all in fact for other editions, and this one definitely deserves its due. It may be more expensive than Mandelbaum's paperback, but its worth it. The print is larger, the language clearer, the notes more useful. Try it out."
3,back to the drawing board,"I was so excited to see this marvelous book ported to kindle I ordered a copy immediately. I love and cherish my physical book versionThe Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri: Volume 1: Inferno (Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri Vol. 1)and could not wait to have it accessible at any time on my kindle. Unfortunately the formatting is horrendously dysfunctional. Since the text of the original Italian and the English translation are on facing pages they muddle into each other. Also this version has only location numbers and not the numbers of the text pages that so often accompany the text of other books. It would be really nice if these things could be fixed, making the kindle version as nice (i.e. useful) as the physical book."
2,"the ""P"" Code","I love Hip-Hop okay. Call me a Hip-Hop fanatic. Thats the reason why I dispise to hear and see my fellow hip-hop fans giving there money away to useless, ignorant, redundant clicks like Cash Money Records. Do you realize how simple these four clowns are. These so called artists will be short lived and Juvenile is definately no exception. This is music your kids will be laughing at you for listening to when they're old enough to make an informed decision. Please people, for every album these clowns put out, put that money in a money market account. In one month you should have, let's see; Sixty Bones. Fifteen dollars a week. Not Fifteen dollars for the weak! Save your money."
4,"WAY BETTER THEN NO LIMIT, JUV IS TIGHT","THIS ALBUM IS TIGHT. MY FAVORITES ARE G-CODE,LIL BOYZ,CATCH YA CUT,AND DA MAGNOLIA.hIS LAST ALBUM IS TIGHT TOO,ESPECIALLY HA REMIX WITH JAY-Z.WHEN IS Turk album coming out because him and wayne be rocking. Turk is alwas rockin though."
1,Sssshhhhhh don't buy it,Damn that's funny. This cd is garbage. There is only two tight songs on the whole album.
3,"YO Juv, what happened?","I was not feeling the CD that much. It needs some work. Juv baby, you need to listen to 400 Degreez then listen to THA G Code and figure out what happened. I was feelin 400 Degreez so when i got this album, i was hurt. I gave him 3 stars for trying"
3,decent follow up to a classic album,"My favorite rapper. Juvenile returns with another album with a bit of deja vu with his first single u understand. The song is okay but not as good as Ha. This album though got some great songs its just not as good the only songs i don't like is the final two songs. But its seems juvenile did not try that hard with the album. I listen to it a lot but i somehow find 400 degrees so much better. The best songs are track 3,5,6,7,10,12,13,and 14."
4,same ol j,"Juveniles new cd ""tha g code"" is a pretty good cd but it lacks hits like juvies 400 degreez album. I think he should have put a little more effort into his beats, but overall his lyrics where there but not quite the same. Pick it up though because the songs are still kickin."
5,THE BEST SINCE 400 DEGREEZ,I THINK NO OTHER RAPER CAN TOP THIS BECAUSE CASHMONEY BLOCK IS STILL HOT U HEARD ME .
3,Aight..,"This CD isn't so great, if you're not a good fan of Juvenile. It has a few good songs here and there, but it definitely wont go down as a great CD. It's iffy if it is worth your money or not, if you like Juvenile get it, if he's just another rapper in your opinion, dont waste your money."
5,Hot Boyz,I really enjoy your CD and Lil' Wayne and also B.G you guys really have alot to say I want you to continue doing your best because some of your songs really help me out
1,I would have given it a zero but amazon won't let me.,"This cd is really terrible! When I got it I thought it would be awesome, but i guess i was just trippin. It's terrible and i think even if yanni was dead he could have done better. This is really a terrible cd. Get 400 Degreez if you want real Juvi."
1,Bad work,I think this is the worst Juvenile CD There are know good songs at all the 1st one was way better
4,Could be better but dtill good,"Juvenile'd new cd THA G-CODE is very nice andit;s got the beat to it. i love it.i have a lot of Cash money Records CD's including the Hot Boy$, B.G., Lil Wayne and some others, The G-Code is oreheaps is the best one. it's got the sharp lyrics, and very nice music by Mannie Fresh. The old CD 400 Degree$ went triple platinum thank to Back That A$$ up, well the new album contains a lot of good songs that in fact might be some of Juvenile's big hit."
1,dawg from thieveland,"I'm a real rap critic and a dj, and I got to honestly say this album was double booty. It has one true song ""u understand"" and the rest was wack. People only request one song and I gotta say his last album was much betta. I wouldn't advise anyone to rate this one higher than it actually should be rated."
4,Juve hits off with another tight album,"With ""400 Degreez"" STILL in the top ten on rap charts a year afer its release, Cash Money knew the faster a new Juve CD came out the better. Some of the track on this CD sound a little rushed, and its not better than ""400 Degreez,"" but this is still a very good album. ""Guerrilla,"" the last track on the album, might just be the best track anybody from Cash Money has put out. Juve teams up with B.G. over a hauntingly eerie beat while a thunderstorm lurks in the background. UNBELIEVABLE. Just pure genius. This track alone is worth the price of this CD. If you like Cash Money or that Down South sound, you'll like this CD."
4,Yall the CD is good!,"U guys have to stop bashin ""Tha G-Code"" Its a good CD. Like all Cash Money releases, the songs are always very catchy and they all get u pumped. As is the same for ""Tha G-code"" If u purchase CD, i can garuantee u if u listen to all the tracks u will be most impressed. 400 Degreez is hard to follow up, but tracks number 2,6, 8, and 13 are all extremely good.... and other good tracks are 2,9, and 10. U probably will like the some other tracks, too! BUY THIS CD, RIGHT NOW, ITS WORTH IT!"
3,Understand This,"U-Understand is a tight song but its the only tight song on the album. I was disapointed when I heard this album, It was almost as bad as Solga Rags. The best Juvie album is 400 degreez."
2,Not his best work,This isnt Juve's best work sorry to say it but he really let me down. Million and one things and I got that fire and catch your cut are the best songs on the cd to tell you the truth. i was expecting better from Juvenile. Only if you are a TRUE CMR fan then i suggest buying Tha G-Code as a used cd from Wharehouse Music or borrow your friends.
3,Can't touch 400 degreez.,"This c.d. is all right. There are probably three songs that are really good. This album's beats are fast but they have no bass what so ever, and the few that do have bass the words don't flow together very good (with the exception of the G-Code). U understand isn't the best song at all it may be the first single but it isn't that good. If you liked the Lil Wayne ce this one is definitley for you. It reminds me a lot of c.d. I used to say Cash Money was the best record label but after Wayne and Juvenile I'm starting to think aftermath entertainment is the best labe. It has the God Dre and Eminem."
2,The downfall of Cash Money? (Read please),"I have the G Code and think it is horrible. 400 Degreez is much better. The G Code doesn't have any songs that stand out except for #9 Catch your Cut ( Very tight track ). As for 400 Degreez there was Back that Azz Up, Ha ( Hot Boys Remix ), and of course Juvenile on Fire. The c.d. isn't good and it is a waste of money, especially with all the other good cd's out now like DMX or Nas. Save your money up and buy that Drag-On or something."
1,This is terribel! just like cash money,"this cd is terrible! i cant believe any1 would actually like this cd, him or even cash money. if u want a good cd then go get master p ghetto d, master p, da last don, master p, only god can judge me, heck get any master p cd they are all great u could also get any tru cd, and silkk the shocker cd, any c-murder cd, heck almost any no limit cd is better than this DONT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!! MASTER P AND THE REST OF NO LIMIT IS BETTER!"
1,Sssshhhh dont buy it.,"Juvenile just coming off of his huge hit 400 degree$e takes a nose dive with this pathetic album i mean this cd dosent even deserve the cash money logo. The only respectible song is U understand, and even that gets old after a while"
2,Saen McDonald is Gay,"I have to agree with that opinion of him cuase he's a hater.But I have to also admit this cd sucks.If you are late to the whole bling era like I was, DO NOT COPP this cd! Get BG's Chopper city in the Ghetto. That was at least 601 degreez.I'm sorry. I'm a hardcore hotboys fan, but I will never think Juve is a good rapper. EVER! I will continue to copp his cds for collectors sake."
4,i tell it like it is,"i don't really like cash money, i am writing this review for one reason. this cd is hot, its much better then 400 degreez. don't listen to the other reviews if their hatin and listen to the g-code cd,every song is tight. i know back that azz up and ha where hits but that whole album does not stand up to this one. straight up the best cash money cd, pick it up and then U UNDASTAND what im talking about"
3,Worst,This CD was a big dissapointment . I only like about 2 songs . LiL Wayne is the best on the cd. I liked a few things though. (1) The cd had some pretty good beats . (2) The flows Were Pretty nice . But If you want a good cd get Hot Boys - Get It How You Live.
2,sounds the same as ALL CMM,"It's ah-right, but c'mon, do they have any other beats? Pretty boring stuff after a while, you know? And alot of the rappers at CMM rap with the same rhythm. You know when you listen to something produced by Dr. Dre or RZA you go ""alright!"" after hearing the first couple beats because it bumps and it's not like anything they've ever done. With Juvy, I have a hard time paying attention to his lyrics because everything else is so boring. Sorry CMM fans, but it had to be said, you know it."
3,It's ok,I was a little disapointed by this album. Ther is really only 2 tracks on this cd. #2 U Understand and #13 I Got That Fire. I think this album is only for serious CMR fans.
1,WHAT DA HELL IS DISS MESS YO JUVY U CAN DO BETTA DEN DAT,SORRY PEOPLE BUT LET ME SPEAK MY MIND. DISS ALBUM IS GARBAGE YO MANNIE FRESH RUNNIN OUTTA BEATZ BECAUSE DATZ WHAT PEOPLE LOOK 4 DESE DAYZ IS JUST BEATZ. I MEAN DA LYRICS CAN BE WACK BUT DA BEATZ CAN BE HOT. I HOPE WHEN BIG TYMERS ALBUM COME OUT IT WON'T BE LIKE DISS GARBAGE ALBUM. I GUESS IF I LISTEN 2 IT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE ALRIGHT. ALL OF THE SONG ON HERE ARE SLOW AND SLUGGISH. SWIZZ BEATZ $ D.J. PAUL CAN MIX BETTA DEN MANNIE FRESH.
3,he CAN do better,"This cd was aight but not his best. He'll be lucky if this cd even goes gold or platinum. Also the songs listed on this sight aren't even on the cd. The cd I have has 16 songs and I only reconize the intro, G-Code, and U Understand. What's up wit dat?"
1,This is whats wrong with rap,"Ever heard of phony rappers? Well heres your example Juvenile and the Cash Money Millionaires. Their beats are all the same, the lyrics mean nothing and they are fake fake fake. You want real hip hop try Talib Kweli, because this is WHACK."
4,Kaplan gets it done,"I purchased this product for my 16 year old daughter. My impressions are based on her comments and reactions to the software which have been uniformly positive. She spends a lot of time at the computer already and, having the software loaded, finds time to practice in between other activities. There is a tremendous amount of content in the product with lots of opportunity for practice and review. The interactivity makes the review and feedback process very fast. Highly recommended, especially when compared to the cost of the in person courses."
5,Holy smokes!,"This disc simply ROCKS! I've always loved Derek Bailey, but for most folks, his fully improv can be hard to get into. But Tacuma and Weston make up an absolutely stunning rhythm section which render DB's playing ""almost accessible"". It's a truly infectuous recording, and an absolute listening joy from start to finish."
3,"OK, but not what I expected","I have been waiting for this book for several months, and was a little disappointed when I finally got it. It features 8 party ideas, such as Bongo Beat Bash and Island Luau. Each of these sections features several interesting cocktail and appetizer recepies, as well as related Shag artwork. All of this is OK but more than a bit sketchy. Except for a bare-bones introduction at the front of the book, there is nothing from the writer on how to throw these parties; even some basic fashion, decorating or organizational suggestions would have been good. I can plan a tiki party with the best of them, but it's still nice to consider other ideas.Not bad overall, but also not a shining example of retro chic either."
5,Great for energy,"I have taken Estrin D for the last few years, and I am in my 50's. I take just one in the morning on an empty stomach, and it gives me energy and lifts my mood. It does help control the appetite, but its biggest advantage is that it acts almost like an anti-depressant. It definitely enhances your emotional mood. Again, I have found it most effective on an empty stomach and in the morning."
1,worst pill,"This is the most worst pill. Im 46 years old good healthy condition,this pills made me feel sick, most all day had headacheDo not waste your money"
3,"Well researched, but somewhat misguided at times.","The Politics of Rightousness: Idaho Christian Patriotism by James Aho is certainly a well researched and well written book about an issue of supreme concern in our country. There are times, however, particularly in the first 150 pages of the book, during which Aho's subjects and points seem to be forgotten and/or spread too thin. In other parts of his book, he seems to base some of his premises on farfetched ideas and foundations. Albeit the foundations of many of the Identity ideals are farfetched within themselves. Regardless of these lulls in Aho's focus, I would strongly recommend this book to anybody who is interested in learning about these dark and mysterious cultural misfits."
3,"I bought this expecting crap, but I'm pleasantly surprised.","I'll be straight with you, if you're expecting Motley Crue music, you're wrong. This is like Kid Rock, except with more uses of the turntable. This is where in my mind, the album fails the most. Honestly, who would prefer electrified noise over a good guitar solo? As far as lyrics go, there's some originality New Skin and Metamorphosis, but most of the words take on a lame idea that Tommy Lee is a gangster. Another failure is the reliance on other rap artists to appear on songs that have nothing to do with what these artists have to say, as in New Skin. Sex is also a downside, (seriously, a grown 35 year old should be a bit more mature than talking about getting naked.) But all in all, this is a good album worth a listen to and comes through in certain circles. If you're a hardcore Crue fan though, you may want to stay away from this Mayhem."
5,The best rap-rock CD EVER!!!!!,Tommy and Telo RULE. All i can say is that this CD is very short (just over a half hour in length) buy it KILLS Limp Bizkit and all the other pretenders out their. Its origional and oh so funky. Great beats and excellent vocals. BUY IT NOW!!!!!
2,huh,"M.O.M. isn't too shaby. However, it's not in the least way an orignal thought. They seem to be simply regurgitating concious thoughts rather than letting the music flow. Want real music? Try: DOUBLE DRIVE, Incubus, or the Deftones. Double Drive is huge, they've been around for a while, however, they are now armed with a real contract, and the guys rock. With FEELING, not some fabricated lyrics."
5,All songs are superb!!!!,"This CD is excellent. It is created by two white guys (Tommy Lee and Tilo) who do a cross between rap and heavy rock. They are helped by Fred Durst (Limp Bizkit), Snoop Dogg, Kid Rock, Lil Kim, Mix Master Mike, U God (Wu Tang). I loved all the songs, not one was terrible. So when you buy this CD you will be paying for 100% good songs -- unlike some CDs when you buy the CD for the songs played on the radio, and that's it, you don't play any of the other songs because they're not very good. Methods of Mayhem (M.O.M.) is just the opposite. You'll be playin' these songs for a long time (intil you are dead) before they ever get old. Some songs are heavy like ""Hypocritical"" other are softer, like ""Metemorphasis."" No matter hard or soft, it is all good. Don't bother with the edited version it ruins all the fun. If you can only get the edited version, wait until you can get the real version. It is worth the wait. Now buy this CD and get your daily dose of Mayhem for the day!!..."
5,IT ROCKS!,"I loved this CD, it's really different than most of the other junk out there. If you like Limp Bizkit, or Kid Rock, you should check this out..as a matter of fact they are both on it! A buncha cameo's and many different beats make this worth the money. It even includes the Get Naked Video. Only downfall, it's not that long, but I'm sure everone can find a song they like on here..GO BUY IT!"
1,Pathetic,"Tommy Lee's musical future probably would have been more successful if he had stayed with Motley Crue. Even the addition and cowriting of several hip/hop artist on this album are not much help. The music is not concise and lacks a consistant melody and beat--which is necessary for a hip/hop record. The lyrics are trashy, leading one to believe that Lee's thoughts go no deeper than sex and vulgarity. On the brighter side, as poor as this album is, MOM can only get better."
1,"Go Back to the Crue, Tommy!","How amusing. Tommy Lee, drummer of world renowned Motley Crue, has started a rap-metal band. Talk about trend hopping! He goes from 80's hair metal, to the 90's equivalent: rapcore. There's absolutely no doubt that Methods of Mayhem would never have been formed if not for the recent explosion of rap rock. That being said, the ""artists"" who supposedly ""pioneered"" rap rock make guest appearances on this pathetic pile... Kid Rock & Fred Durst. Both on one CD. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Hell. There is simply no other way to put it... this album sucks. Methods of Mayhem are simply another parasite, leeching away at the foundation of rap-metal. The music is bland and uninteresting. The lyrics are terrible. But what do you expect with song titles such as ""Who the Hell Cares,&quot... Total garbage. Avoid at all costs. I can't believe they were on Ozzfest..."
3,METHODSofMAYHEM,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE OTHER FOOLS ARE THINKIN' THIS ALBUM RULES! IF YOU LIKE LIMP BIZKIT,KORN,AND RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE YOU WILL LUV THIS! METHODSofMAYHEM RULES!"
4,Methods of Mayhem,"If your looking for the old Tommy Lee, go back under your rock and blow the dust off your records! This is definitely not for you. If you like Limp B, Kid Rock, and Rage, with down and nasty lyrics, this will be right up your alley. I had to go out and purchase a new amp for my car that went all the way to 13 for this one! Keep it loud and keep it on! Hard beats with lots of change ups, good cuts, will keep me interested until I wake up and realize I have no taste in music... peace."
4,"Excellent, but short","Minus one star for being only a little over 30 minutes. Besides that, this album is an excellent cd. It even has a multimedia part that lets you play the Get Naked video on your computer. The guest artists are also a major bonus to this album."
4,Very rangy style!,"Tommy Lee and rapper Tim ""TiLo"" Murray hook up to create yet another record that sounds like Limp Bizkit...this album even includes Bizkit frontman Fred Durst in ""Get Naked"", which is probably one of the better songs on the album. ""HypoCritical"" is my favorite song, including a catchy chorus and some sweet drum beats. Lee and Murray make good attempts at producing songs where singing actually occurs - that's something to be avoided...However, the humongous list of guests makes this album well worth buying for rap, metal, rock, and techno fans alike."
1,here we go again (sweet jesus why? ),"Wow how surprising another $3 bill (mr pam anderson) thinks hey everyone else is doing it why can't I. Just what we need ANOTHER rap/rock record full of garbage so called music. Oh hey Mr Anderson Lee love the corn rolls or braids or whatever you have you hair styled in, your so so so original and hip. Tommy Lee here's to your wife cause it's the only think that makes you noticed. Your pathetic go back to the crue before it's too late. No wonder vince punched you, too bad it didn't knock any sense into you. Little doubt that this soft boiled effort will fade fast and the record company will regret sinking a penny into such nonsense."
2,"Oops, go back the Crue man!","Don't get me wrong, there are some good songs on this puppy, but not enough to save it. It is altogether to rap for me. Redeeming values: ""Hypocritical,"" ""New Skin,"" and to a lesser extent ""Get Naked."" Get this Cd used at a garage sale for a buck or 2 ok?"
2,good for a laugh,this album is just plain silly. the sad thing is i dont think tommy and the boys are joking here. the record features a lot of guest appearances from a variety of today's stars such as the angry guy from limp bizkit but it cannot save a band concept rooted in bad ideas.
2,Poor Audio CD,Very difficult to get into. Misled by the good stars given by others. Listen to audio CDs frequently and rarely encountered one as bad as this.
4,Enjoyed this one better than Morrigan's Cross,"I felt this book moved more quickly than Morrigan's Cross, although I did like the Glenna & Hoyt's story. It is definantly a different type of series for Nora but I like it so far, as long as you are willing to let go and just accept the fantasy of it. It is much more violent than what one would expect from her books but it fits nicely into the subject...she doesn't allow sugar coating there and I am glad for it. Looking forward to the next one!"
2,Not Nora Robert's Best,"I read the entire trilogy, hoping the books would improve. They did not. There is poor character development and a sad plot. Even the ""twist"" at the end of book three was predictable mid-way through book one. While I am normally a Nora Roberts fan, these books were obviously only published because Jove knew they would sell no matter how bad they were, due purely to the author's name on the cover. For shame!"
5,dance of the gods nora roberts,"when the good lord was handing out talent, nora was in the very front of the line. who else but roberts could have a set of books that take the reader from the twenty-first century ,microwaves and mp3 players to the days of stonehenge, castles, and no indoor plumbing...and make it all sound plausible! the ""dance of the gods"" is the story of blair the vampire slayer (think a mature and edgier buffy) and larkin a shape-shifter. i liked the way roberts paired this modern day/ancient day couple. they faced the trials of the quest and of melding their two worlds with humor and love. this series is a slam dunk! and i loved all three of them"
5,Dance of the Gods,"This book along with the first two is awesome. I am a huge Nora Roberts fan and this trilogy will not let you down. I loved the way she described Gaell and how she brought the past and the present together. I can't say enough good things about this book. If you haven't read this trilogy yet, it is a must read."
2,Vampires,"Although Nora Roberts remains one of my favorite authors, I could not read this book. Her writing and subject matter made me stop after 40 pages. What happened to the wonderful books of the Irish or the brothers from the Chesapeak?"
1,"Disgusting, bloodthirsty garbage--""0"" stars","I have been a Robert's fan for 2 decades--own just about everything she has ever written--and this trilogy is the most disgusting, bloodthirsty, violent, grotesque piece of trash I have ever read. She just can't have written these. If the rating allowed ""O"" stars that would be my rating. Unfortunately, since so many millions of us buy on faith, the trilogy will most undeservedly end up a best-seller unit. I read #1 and threw it out, something I have never ever done with a Robert's book. Got 1/3 of the way threw #2 and into the garbage along with the untouched #3."
2,many books georgia,"This 2nd book was a little better than the first but slow and diappointing, I am surprised that Nora would write such book. Not her usual greatness. I would not recommend it and I love Nora's writing most of the time."
5,Great continuation of the series,"Another Nora Roberts classic. Great characters, more complex than previous books.Characters are appealing, no weak pathetic women that you find in normal romance books!"
4,Good book.,Pretty typical Nora Roberts book. I like vampire stories and this one was had some interesting twists. The 1st and 3rd are excellent as well.
5,amazing,As usual nora roberts delivers another amazing book. her talent for writing is top notch. this entire trilogy has been spectacular.
5,The best way to get your daily fiber,Just a cup of this stuff gives you 28 grams of fiber for only 120 calories...and it doesn't taste too bad either! Way better than All-Bran. No contest.
3,Good book on grasses with excellent illustrations.,"This book offers a fine overview on grasses and is particulaly strong in the range and quality of the photos. If you have trouble choosing or identifying grasses from descriptions or line drawings this book will help enormously. My particular interest is the bamboos. There are photos of bamboos not often seen in this country (USA). The photos make the book a valuable addition to the books available on bamboo. But the text dealing with bamboo has many errors, surprising with an author with Roger Ground's experience. The book is published in this country by Timber Press and in the UK by David & Charles Publishers but is clearly a UK book reworked for the US market."
2,Only for a very particular audience,"This novel is really geared toward a very specific audience. Let me briefly tell you about the language and situations in the book so you can see if it is a good choice for you. First it all takes places on one part of an international corporation which caters to men who like to consume ejaculate. Second, this particular branch uses equipment and terms which equates the men who produce [sperm] to cows. There is also some more resort style arrangments in the hotel part of the farm but by and large the fantasy is farm and animal based. Normally I'd give a book that focuses on such a specific fantasy three stars however I also feel that the motivations and internal drives of the characters are seriously short changed in this novel. Likewise the plot cuts off then we flash ahead to months later and frankly the events that lead up to those runaway mancows would have been entertaining. Thus I give this 2 stars only."
2,ho hum...,"the book has an awesome premise and the beginning is FANTASTIC, but then the author takes it away from the delightfully sadistic, perverse angle it was going towards and suddenly i was reading a story about a male whorehouse where it's all oral sex with the focus being swallowing semen (yawn). if the author had kept the tone that was in the beginning, this book would have been perfect. as it is, don't waste the time reading it."

3,"Good coffee, but...","When ordering, please be aware that this unit is all plastic with the exception of the carafe. The picture gives a very different impression. Also, after several uses the mechanism that allows you to interrupt the brewing cycle to get a cup of coffee started malfunctioning so that the basket filled up with water while the carafe was in place. After this happening twice (be aware we just set it up to brew and the coffee maker did this on its own), I removed the spring that makes the mechanism close off the drip. Now we won't be able to interrupt the brewing cycle, but we won't have overflows either. When it works right, the coffee tastes great."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I purchased this coffee maker a week ago, used it for three days, and then put it firmly away. I will not go to the closet I put it in; it is an Ugly Place. This coffee maker is horribly made. The lid has to be pried off of the carafe, and its hinges appear to be so weak and apt to break that you find yourself preforming an oxymoron and prying gingerly. The filter takes an act of God to remove and put back onto the machine; you have to lift and turn and adjust and pray that *that* hinge will not break in the process. (because it, too, is a thin little piece of plastic) Worst of all, the carafe doesn't fit onto the hot plate. It sits askew and no amount of adjusting will make it flush with the plate. The coffee was good, although not very hot (see askew carafe), but all in all, this was just a poorly made piece of jumk."
2,The spilling carafe,"What good is a good cup of coffee if you are constantly wiping up spills from the carafe, either when you are pouring water into well, or when you are pouring coffee into your cup. We have never been able to avoid spills from the carafe. Frustrating enough to bring old machine up from basement and start to use again.This is a shame becuase the coffee was excellent. We are considering retrurning the unit."
2,Steamed,My Hamilton Beach 43425 Platinum FlavorPlus 10-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker creates so much steam that I had to move it away from my cabinets as it was removing the wood stain. It seems to lose most of its product through steam.
2,nothing special,it's nothing special for the price. and where in the world do you buy a replacement carafe?
1,Awful,"This book is the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune of reading. It sounds like it was written by a 13 year old whose teacher told them to ""use very descriptive words."" You will probably hear something like ""the tears poured like a waterfall from my sad-looking face into the ocean of my painful tears"" or something like it, at some point while reading this trash. The only time I would recommend reading it is if you just swallowed poison and need to get it out of your system, because this book will make you nauseous immediately."
5,a must have!,"This is a AWESOME soundtrack. I love the movie and everytime I watch it I see more depth. It is sneaky funny in some parts and just hilarious in others. The movie would not be as good however, without this amazing compilation of songs. They fit the changing moods perfectly. I listen to it the car and at home. The movie introduced me to a couple songs I hadn't heard and reminded me of some I had forgotten. You can enjoy it over and over."
4,"Good music, but incomplete album","I loved the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed all the music mentioned and played. I especially liked the inclusion of the Dylan song and ""Twist in My Sobriety.""However, I am not sure why the U2 song was not included, as it's played twice in the movie, and is especially significant as the closing song. The only reason I can think of is that the group did not agree to having it on the soundtrack. If that is true, shame on U2 for marring a great set of music! If it was the producers of the album, shame on them for depriving us."
3,But were is MSI!?????,"Yes, this album is very very incomplete. Aside from the great U2 not being there, where the heck is Mindless self indulgence(my favorite band )??? They were played for like a minute and a half when Bruce willis and that other guy walk in on that young guy and that girl making out. It was a song called kill the rock and its great. So i don't know why they didn't put it there!"
3,Where's U2?,"Why do soundtracks always seem to be missing one big song or another? In this case, they left out the awesome U2 song ""Beautiful Day"" and possibly others that I'm not recalling right now. This makes listening to the soundtrack like seeing the Three Stooges without Moe. Maybe people would be less critical if they haven't already seen the movie."
5,"I don't need love, I've got The Radio Dept","This album was released directly after ""Lesser Matters"" and is a continuation of the same style. While later albums like ""Pet Grief"" found the band exploring more synth-style pop, ""Pulling Our Weight"" shows the band at its peak. Every song on the ep is classic and flows just as smoothly as ""lesser Matters"". There is an overall grandiose feeling to these songs, only on a laid back scale. If you dug their first album and wanted to hear more like it, than this ep is a definite own."
2,All Things Townshend,"Chances are, if you're a Townshend fan--You've got acoustic versions of his songs already from ""The Secret Policeman's Ball"" series. There's one or two things on here I liked, but overall, I was disappointed with Raphael Rudd's inconsistent diddling on the harp.The final three songs on the album are truly hideous. Caterwauling of the same verse over and over while banging on a piano. I was always of the opinion that Pete knew more than three chords, but he didn't use any of them here.Tying ""Tattoo"" to his religious beliefs reflects poorly on Pete AND ruins a humorous song.I did, however like ""Sleeping Dog"" and ""Let My Love Open the Door"".This album's for completists only."
2,Not Fit For Release,Pete Townshend's Oceanic Concerts is only interesting for its historic value. It amazes me that a recording of such low quality was officially released. The generally monophonic recording sounds like a bootleg. Distortion can be heard when Townshend plays his acoustic guitar too loud. The performances are nothing special either. Raphael Rudd's harp and piano playing doesn't fit well with Pete's guitar. It doesn't even seem like they rehearsed the few songs they played together on.Oceanic Concerts just shows that objectivity must be observed when releasing a CD. Quality should be paramount.I would rather hear an expanded version of Deep End Live which would include the songs from White City that were performed.[DW]
3,Tease!,"Pete, I love ya, but please stop jerking us around. Expand, remaster, and reissue your Deep End Live concert! Your loyal fans are waiting!"
2,Oceanic Concerts is a Washout,"I never heard of Mr. Rudd. His fortune to play with Pete Townshend adds no value to this recording. As a Townshend fan and music collector, I now own another recording I do not really need. The recording value is awful. The performance value is questionable. Pete's tunes hurt my ears even though the selections were choice. Rudd's selections are plesently esoteric. Its too bad the source material could not be improved upon with today's technology. I fail to see or hear the historical value since after three or four listings I would have to swim the Atlantic before needing to wet my appetite again with this disc."
5,"""I have come not to teach but to awaken""","Let's start off first with an acknowledgement. If you have not figured out by now that Pete Townshend is not The Who(God bless you Keith Moon R.I.P.)then you should not be reviewing this CD.For those of you who just poured a shot for the greatest(rock 'n' roll) drummer that ever lived--thank you.For the fans of Peter Dennis Blandford Townshend you already know of his genius. Raphael Rudd's work on this CD is more than pleasing. It brings to mind some of the better ambient works by Eno. That is only meant to be a comparison that unfamiliar rock fans can understand. His playing can be passionate and discordant as well but for god's sake he's not trying to be a rock star, he was classically trained at the Manhattan School of Music. Listen with open ears to ""Sound Barrier"", then listen to his accompaniment on songs like ""Let My Love Open the Door"" etc. Pete Townshend fans will love this CD, especially the superlative rendition of ""Drowned""."
4,"A Classic, Intimate Portrait","This is a fantastic unplugged album, though it was recorded well before the unplugged idea came into being. There are probably four or five essential tunes here, including versions of The Who classics ""Bargain,"" ""Drowned,"" and ""The Seeker."" Those tunes barely prepare you for the stellar version of Townshend's ""Let My Love Open the Door,"" which appeared on his Empty Glass album about the time this set was recorded. In between those highlights, Rudd provides some really fine moments on the harp. The insightful, occasionally intimate ramblings of Townshend between songs adds to the value of this package. The primary flaw is the distortion we sometimes hear coming from Townshend's guitar...this is bothersome, not a deal killer. Essential for all serious Who/Pete Townshend fans."
5,Townshend Adds to his Legacy...,Simply wonderful...a departure for Pete that finds him in fine form. Raphael Rudd and his harp and piano pieces really blend well with the Who classics as well as the then new (1980) songs from Empty Glass. Can't go wrong with this one...grab it and let a master take you on an amazing journey.
4,Very lovely.,"I have both size and love them both. However the bracelet will come off easily enough and you may lose it, which I probably have since I just realized I wasn't wearing it."
1,Horrible,"This book is boring for my kid. A better book is Everyone Poops or The Gas We Pass. The quality of the pages, illustrations, pages, binding and especially the writing is also not up to par at all. I felt really ripped off by this purchase. Don't buy it!"
5,"Very high quality, very reasonable price",I got this book to give as a gift to a friend in China. It is very high quality and specific to the USA as a reminder of our friendship.
5,Take a moment to reflect...,"...on the extraordinary beauty of this nation of ours. I have seen many a pictorial essay on the varied landscapes and cityscapes that make up the United States, but have never seen one that is so flawlessly beautiful. Each of these photographs manages to perfectly capture the many varied moods and seasons of this vast nation and they are all breathtaking. Whether it's a picturesque colonial street in Nantucket or the awe-inspiring majesty of the Grand Tetons, each subject is given equal attention; the composition of the pictures never want for anything. Sit back, relax and take it all in. There is a greatly deal here to both enjoy and inspire."
4,"Great album, except for one thing","The songs are uplifting and inspirational. The only drawback is most of the songs are sung at a live concert, judging from the audiences clapping in the beginning/ending. I wish the cd cover had indicated this before I bought it. That's why I give this a four star, instead of a five star. Fortunately, you can get rid of the clappings if you have editing software and save the songs to the computer.""I Rejoice"" stands out. What an energizing and amazing piece! I don't think anyone can top the way it is chorused by this group of women.Rita Baloche's tender interpretation of ""But For Your Grace"" brought tears to my eyes the first time I heard it and renew my heartfelt appreciation of God's mercy and grace every time I listen to it.I have the upbeat ""We Bring The Sacrifice Of Praise"" from a Don Marsh album, however, the one on this cd is a slow tempo and in its own way beautiful."
4,podria ser mejor!,Encuentro bueno este disco de anastasia. Es muy entretenido el karaoke. Se lo recomiendo a todos los fanaticos de anastasia.
5,SEXY MEN AT IT AGAIN!,"These sexy men don't stop on this great Essence c.d. called The Love Songs! It's a great gift for that specail lady in your life to express the way you feel about her! With artist like Eric Benet, Joe, Keith Washington, and D'Angelo it's a sure thang! It will have your lady grabbing for a fan or grabbing for you! So go out and get it, it's a sure thang!"
2,"a compelling read, but rife with errors","If the author could be more careful with facts, I for one would welcome a second edition, because I enjoyed the first one so much, despite the howlers."
3,Surreal Reading is more like it,"Perhaps the author got a little bored with covering the details of the artist's lives. It couldn't have been all action-action-action, they had to write, paint, create sometime. It's when she starts to dive into the murky waters of their disagreements and breaks over the minutae of esoteric intelli-quibbles that the reading drags. Decent in parts, and a worthy education, but a little like taking medicene in parts."
2,Blow out central,"I received these as a gift at a baby shower. Most friends recommended Pampers Swaddlers for my son, and had been using them until I ran out. I tried these Huggies and they leaked almost every time I used them. I kept using them, to give them another chance, but after 5 leaks/blowouts, I threw them out. I swear by Pampers Swaddlers!"
5,Make you wanna move,"HIs guitar playing is incrediable, his other band memeber can carry their own!!! You don't know if you want to dance or sit and listen as not to misss a single note"
2,"wordy, too much detail, too theoretical",This book snow-balls the reader with tons of trivial details that have little to do with clinical endodontic practice. It provides a confusing picture of how to function clinically. Out of touch with reality. I don't know why it is so standard in dental schools.
1,It's got too much word than information itself,"It had some OK pictures and the context is not well organized.Paragraphs are too long and doesn't attract readers attentaion because of too much word then the content itself. I met Dr. Cohen in San Francisco and found him to be a good Sales man then a good Doctor or an Author. I've attended his lectures and find him too wordy and not enough meat in his lectures either. Not sure why so many Professor still recommend him.Personally I think this book should be utilized as recycling item because I didn't get any useful information out of it. Please try to read other dental authors book, for sure this one is NOT the one you really want to read. It's waist of money and your time."
1,Boring!!,"I've never fall asleep reading a book. I fell asleep ready this book twise. BORING!!It sure is wordy and waistful. I am an average ""A-"" student and usually don't critize any book but this one I felt that I waisted my money. Content is disorganized. WORDY. This book makes me hate dentistry because of so much garbage is in it, not enough content...Don't buy this one, you'll regred."
1,dont waste ur money on this product,they wiggle on the gun and the screws snapped wen i tightened them. dont buy these just get the steel breach if you hav the 1377. dont spend ur hard earned cash on this POS product.
3,A convenient accesory,"works good with light sights... I got it to put on top a light red dot sigth, I'm not sure it will be sturdy enough to use a full size scope."
4,Intermounts work well with a little modification,"I purchased these intermounts for my Crosman 1377 Air Pistol. Since they are about the only option to attach a scope or sight without getting a whole new breech, I purchased them, but was a little hesitant after reading many of the reviews that said that the mounts were loose on the barrel. I simply put a small piece of black electrical tape (sticky side against the inside of the mount) inside each mount where they wrap around the barrel and I have a very firm fit of the mounts to the barrel, without having to tighten the screws so hard that they strip as many others have had problems with. I have mounted a weaver rail to the intermounts and a Leapers Red/Green Dot Sight to that, and it all seems to be pretty well solidly in place. Overall, this is a decent product with just a little simple addition of electrical tape to make it grip the metal barrel more firmly."
4,"Works, but needs work!","These work very well on this gun. However, you will strip out the puny screws trying to tighten them enough. I drilled them out and tapped them for 6-32UNC. I used a 5/8'' socket cap screw. Other than that little issue, they are very nicely machined."
3,crosman mounts,the mounts are made well for a crosman 1377 pistol but not a lot of scops the red dot scope i bough the mounts for didnot work to well i am looking for a new scope now
3,Better to get another receiver.,Not too impressed with these mounts but they'll due until I buy the steel receiver.
1,These mounts suck,I got a set of these mounts for my 1377 and when mounted they move from side to side enough you can not set a scope or red dot sight zeroed!! Get you a steel breack kit and not this junk!!!
4,Works,Did exactly what they say it should do. for when you dno't have a aftermarket breech on your Crosman pistol. mine fit tight but I retapped to 8/32 anyway.. easy to do for most.
5,Dependable mounts,When think of a mount for a rifle here it is nothing fancy but it does the job. The one thing I wish it had was a built in red dot scope or a mini fridge
2,works but Just..,Pluses..Very good price. Negatives can't be tightened very well and the screws can strip. I have a pair of these on a 1377 crossman and they are usable but the scope moves around more then I like. If this is all you can afford buy them. They work. If not get the far better crossman block mount.
2,Not worth the money.... Please read....,You cannot use these mounts to solidly put a scope on a Crosman 1377C. The fit is so loose and wiggly that putting a scope on top of the mounts is useless. Spend the extra money for the steel breech kit that should come on the 1377C in the first place. I'm returning this product immediately. I hope this helps some folks.
2,Quality NOT acceptable!,The screws are not hardened steel. Make any adjustments as few times as possible or you will strip the screw heads. I purchased this item for my crosman pump pistol and scrapped that idea. I gave it two stars because Quality is far from satisfactory!!!
1,Not what I was looking for,wanted to mount a red dot sight on my taurus 22. The clamps have no kind of tightening ability and if it is not the gun they were specifically designed for they will not work. A bolt and nut through them would work better than this set up.
5,human-centered e-business,"Most literature on e-business falls under two categories: books for pratictioners, full of programming and system configuration examples, and economics essays aimed at executives and businessmen in general.This book is different, and I strongly reccommend it to those who seek the computer scientists' point of view on e-business and its relationship with ongoing research in human-centered computer technology.Human-centered computing is, according to many, one of the most exciting research areas in CS. Check out this book to understand what it us."
4,Kingston Memory,older computer custom build 2005 needed some fresh memory Kingston Memory 1GB DIMM 184-pin DDR 400 MHz PC3200 - unbuffered delivers as promised
5,A must have for Masada/Zorn fans,Young Danny Zamir presents a very Masada like album in Satlah. Zorn's influence in this album is very apparent especially in his 3 tracks on this album. Zorn does a great job of bringing out the best of Zamir. A must have for all Masada fans!
4,I really like these shoes!,"These shoes are super light! Due to this, they are somewhat minimalistic. The advantage is your foot breathes like no other shoe I've worn before, the downside is your feet quickly get wet in bad weather and they aren't all that durable. They also have less cushioning than my last shoes and initially my feet would get sore on runs longer than about 90 minutes, but that quickly passed and I recently used them for the Philadelphia marathon without discomfort (in my feet - my legs were quite another story!!).They are wearing quicker than other NB shoes I've had.I have noticed my running mechanics are better in this shoe, my toes normally point outward quite a bit, with these shoes I run with my feet straight.I use them on all terrain: asphalt, grass, trails and a little concrete with no problem.I set my 10k PR wearing these shoes.Bottom line: I'm sticking with them."
5,Great Guide to beginnning your SAR canine,Great book for gettting the basics for beginning Search and Rescue work with a canine. Book gives a step-by-step approach to training the canine as well as the handler. I recommend this book to anyone that needs information in canine SAR work.
5,"THIS IS ""THE"" BOOK ON SEARCH AND RESCUE!","This easy-to-read, well-researched book by an obviously experienced search and rescue person covers everything from the history of Search and Rescue through every possible aspect of training, including the basics of how a dog begins to learn. Illustrated with photos and sketches, this book provides a wonderful resource for anyone interested in Search and Rescue. It's no wonder this book was nominated as a Best Book of The Year by The Dog Writers' Association of America! It's a job well-done by an author with first-hand knowledge of her subject."
5,"Excelent, easy to follow","Excelent, very good book, easy to follow, if you know the basics of training. (operational cond.). If you're interested in SAR, this is a MUST. I begin in this, asking for the best books, all the people involved in this, recomended this as the 1st. choice...."
5,One of the most comprehensive books on Search & Rescue,"Susan Bulanda's new book ""Ready""! explains how to train a handler (and the dog). Starting with a brief history of dogs in search and rescue, it provides an overview of the training required to attain the necessary SAR skills-for both handler and dog. Specific commands and article retrieval are finding are presentedin an easy-to-follow format with training goals,methods, testing and problems clearly defined.Practical & well researched the book is illustrated with many photos. Ready will be of interest to dog handlers and casual readers alike.SARSCENE a publication of the National Association of Search & Rescue"
5,Great Value,This buffing compound is as good as any I have used in the past. I use it to polish plastic. It is great for polishing headlights and taillights on your car. Excellent value.
4,"Supports ""Big Picture"" spreadsheet work & multi-tasking as well","With a net screen size of just over 12"" by 19.5"" this unit allows for arranging data -- at an easily readable scale -- either vertically or horizontally such that complex larger spreadsheets, or multi-spreadsheet / text reconciliation / comparison work, can be arranged and worked on very effectively. While for my purposes I do wish it were available ""wider"", on the order of, say, 15-16"" x 19.5"", never mind: this monitor makes for a major improvement in working with such data, and has been a very worthwhile expenditure."
3,Not the Intro to Darkwave I would have done,"The tracks on this CD are fine songs, for the most part, and the CD is well worth getting, but I'd describe less than half of the tracks as darkwave. Tracks 5, 6, 7, 11, and 14 could be described as precursors to darkwave. Tracks 10, 12, 13, and 15 don't really belong in a darkwave compilation.Of course, it's a matter of opinion, and there are no set rules as to what constitutes darkwave, but I think most darkwave fans will agree with me that the following artists are good examples of the genre: Aenima, Dargaard, Pilori, Qntal, Estampie, Unto Ashes. They're a good place to start if you're interested."
4,Holiday Music,Christmas Cocktails is a interesting Christmas CD. It reminds me of thehard to find misic that you can hear on the Radio Stations. I wouldrecommend it to listen to.
1,Overrated underperformer,"This is NOT the best of both worlds; in fact, it's not good as either a slant or a point tweezer. The pointy end doesn't work at all. The slanty side doesn't grab the hair. I don't mind paying good money for a good tweezer but this one is two thumbs down. (I tried to give it zero stars but the lowest the system accepts is one.)"
4,"Very nice, does not cut hair while pulling it off","Excellent quality, I own 2 different types of Rubis and I am planning to get lots more products from them (i.e. scissors, cuticle clips and so on). I personally prefer Rubis Swiss Cross - Slant Tweezer (it's red with swiss cross on it) to this one, but Slant/Point is also not bad."
2,Doesn't grab hair. Go for the rubis slant.,I have a pair of the plain slants and love them. These are terrible. They are super pointy and appear well made but the slanted edge does not come together and grabs no hair. The only effective area on these tweezers is the very tip. I'll be returning these and getting another pair of the slants.
4,Cute Book!,I laughed out loud in several places in this book. A sweet love story in spite of the death of somebody we never meet. A light hearted summer read. Tuck it in your beach bag or back pack.The one thing that bothered me was the fact that I didn't know the age of anybody other than Nick and Hortense. I guess I need that frame of reference. Somewhere it was mentioned that he was 35. I figured out Hortense's age when I read that she'd been 14 four years before. I would like to have know Lyddie's age and the twins. I kept thinking those 2 kids needed to be laid over a knee for a good whack or two. Especially the girl who never seemed to care that they caused so much trouble and pain for the rest of her family.I look forward to reading more of Tori Light's books in the future.
5,Good collection from past Vogue issues,"Some sporty styles, some classics -- all at varying skill levels, so anyone can find something in this book to knit. Most of the sweaters are from more recent (last 10 years) magazine issues, so you may have at least a few of these already. Others I haven't seen before, even though they look fairly current. If a yarn is no longer available, the author offers a substitute. As usual, the knitting instructions are clearly laid out, so knitting these sweaters should not be troublesome. For simpler designs, Malcolm has published a very easy, very vogue edition which also has a nice variety, mainly for a beginning or early intermediate knitter. But again, beginners or intermediates can find a lot for them in this volume as well."
3,Not my favorite,"Some of the designs in this book are good, but most I am not interested in knitting. I like the vogue book ""Very Easy Knits"" a lot better. I would not recommend this book, the styles are outdated maybe if you wait 15 to 20 more years these styles might come back in again."
4,Classic Patterns,"I love this knitting book which is filled with classic patterns from the past. It is similar to Vogue Knitting: Very Easy Knits, but the patterns are more complicated. The one thing I don't like about this is the fact that some of the styles use shoulder pads which are no longer in ""vogue"". The patterns would have to be altered to change that. Most of the patterns are usable as is, however. There are many elegant, classic sweaters and other garments included in this book. I would recommend it as an addition to any knitter's library."
4,Rhino Puts Soul into the '70s Again,"Can You Dig It? is a fantastic and eclectic compilation of some of the best of `70s soul...perhaps the one musical genre of the decade that didn't suffer from overt corporationalism or camp. The lack of a 5-star review only reflects the fact that there was quite a bit of bleed-over from other similar Rhino theme products, with a number of tracks included here repeated from the Have a Nice Decade box set and the Didn't It Blow Your Mind series. For those not familiar with these other selections, Dig will be an indispensable addition to your collection. For those with a bit of ""polyester"" in their CD library, there's still a lot of hard-to-find, yet timeless tracks in this set impossible to find elsewhere."
2,O.K. for the price,"This two video set is soft-core all female pornography. The women contained within this video undress from various outfits, then run their hands over their bodies. They touch just about everything except their vaginas. The actresses range from ""solid attractive"" to just less then attractive. The acting itself is poor. Overall, the two videos should have been condensed to one.This video is worth the money you will pay. However, realize that it resembles more of a fun, party film. It is not very erotic."
1,Disappointing performances and recording,"Very disappointing. For those who love and remember the original Cash recordings, most of these performances will be disappointing and uninspiring. The entire performance was shot with strong blue lighting which doesn't help the video quality. The sound recording - which is listed as PCM 5.1, Dolby 5.1 and PCM Uncompressed Stereo - all sounds bad - with a lot of apparent echo and ambience added to the recording. Anyone interested in an authentic tribute to Cash should check out the Cash Music Festival 2011 DVD recorded at the Arkansas State University - a benefit concert to restore his boyhood home. That DVD has better performances and better recording."
5,Finally!,"I love this book! Being a Christian, it was nice to finally see someone make no apologies for their beliefs and not sugar coat things so that they don't offend anyone. The very first passage is offensive to anyone who isn't a Christian because it talks about, of all things, people going to hell. Heaven forbid.The book is very well written and for those of you who aren't aware of this, it is not self published. Publish America is a very well respected small publishing company based in Maryland. A simple Internet search would have pointed this out to you.My only complaint with the book is that it is too short. If you're a Christian get this book."
1,Wishing I could give it zero stars,"Do Not buy this book, it is self published and sure shows it. The author needs to get basic grammer skills of the 6th grade. The story has zero suspense and non entertaining. The only reason why I finished reading it is since I was on a cruise to Venezuela in Bad weather, if not for that I would have thrown it over-bored!"
3,Wish the magnet was a little stronger,"I used to have a magnetic paper towel holder that was better than this one, but I guess this is best one available now. I found that if it was placed horizontally, it would fall off the refrigerator every time I tried to tear off a towel. But if I place it vertically, and remember to always pull up to tear the towel, never down, it stays in place and is quite usable."
1,magnetic paper towel holder,"I really loved this product when it arrived at the house! However, at approx 1:00 in the morning (on the night after it arrived)the rack and roll of towels fell down-leaving the magnet stuck to the refrigerator. We used superglue to readhere the magnet to the foam that was stuck to the towel rack-which worked for a few days until the foam and magnet released the roll and rack again. I really think that there are better products out there-maybe one whose manufacturer uses a better adhesive? Anyway, it's in the trash now-what a waste of money!"
2,Magnet is attached with weak glue,"I've owned two of these. The first one lasted for several years, but then the magnet that holds the towel holder to the fridge peeled off the towel holder. I bought a new one. Apparantly they started using a weaker glue on the newer models. The magnet peeled off again, but this time it was just a matter of months.I think they should attach the magnet with some recessed rivets or get some stronger, long lasting glue. I'm not going to pay 8 dollars + 5 for shipping every five months for a cheap towel holder."
4,Magnetic Paper Towel Holder,"A great space saver and convenient to use. Every once in a while, especially when I'm attaching a new roll of paper towels, the magnets don't hold and the holder either slips or falls. Fortunately, it's easy to put back in place!"
3,It's ok...,It's a decent paper towel holder. Still slides around when you go to rip off the paper towel. It doesn't fall off the frig though.
1,Not very magnetic,"There is not much magnetic holding force. The holder with a paper towel roll will just hold on the side of a Kenmore Refrigerator. Most of the time, it comes off the refrigerator when you try to pull off a paper towel."
2,THe magnet part of the magnetic paper holder keeps coming off- Reglued several times,"Not ery happy with this product. Magnet keeps coming off and after several glue attempts, it is useless"
1,Buyer Beware,"After working rather well for about 4 months, the adhesive holding the magnetic strip to the plastic began losing its sticktuitiveness. Maybe it was because I switched from Viva to Bounty and the product just couldn't handle the additional 2 ounces of paper. Once again, cheap Chinese crap being unloaded on un- and suspecting Americans. Seller would NOT stand behind their product ... probably in fear for their lives."
2,Good idea but poor quality,"I have had this item for roughly a month now, and I was very happy with it at first. However, a week ago the paper towel holder fell off the magnet, leaving the magnet on the refrigerator and the foam adhesive on the holder. I tried gluing it back on but that only lasted for two days. I am very disappointed with this product, do not buy! It is a great idea but needs better adhesive."
3,just what i needed,a no-brainer. works great cuz i can't drill holes in my kitchen. stays in place on my fridge.it didn't take long though before the magnet came unglued. so now it just sits on my countertop until i get this glued back together.
1,Hate It,Magnet NOT strong enough! Keeps popping off of my fridge! Waste of money! Very disappointed!
1,Got abad one!,"Based on all the positive reviews, I orderd one. I put it on the fridge and within 5 minutes it fell to the floor. Well, not all of it; the magnet hung on to the fridge, the adhesive on the magnet had failed. I'm waiting for return authorization from the seller."
1,Did not last even a month!,"I got this, thinking that it's going to save counter space. What a waste of $14 (I think so inclu. shipping) I stuck it on my fridge, but it was constantly falling, while pulling the paper. And one day it just fell on the ground, with the magnet still stuck on the fridge. I scraped the remaining sticker which was on the unit. Got a strong adhesive wall mounting tape and now stuck it on the kitchen wall above the gas range. It's even more handy then the original."
1,Casey Kasem would love this one..........,"Oh brother, it's like listening to the top fourty countdown! Some of the songs are good, but they're just thrown together. This compilation would have been better if they invested more time in picking out the songs. Disco, dance and pop music don't belong on the same cd together! But that's my opinion, to each his own."
2,What a Let Down!,I adored the movie Moulin Rouge and the soundtrack is one my favorite CDs but the book was a great let down. I was hoping to find a written explaantion of how Moulin Rouge was made and to see pictures from this glorious film. Instead it seems more like an overpriced graphic novel. The fact that there is not one clear photograph of either Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor is ridiculous. Hopefully some one else will write a real book about the making of the film.
1,Moulin Rouge! -- RETURNED,"When I saw the film I was blown away. I love to know more about how a film was made and what was in the filmmaker's mind when he/she made it. In the case of this film, I REALLY wanted to get into the director's mind. I was also very interested in seeing the production design and the art from the development of the film. Boy, was I disappointed. This glossy hardbound coffee table-style book is nothing more than a ""photonovel"" -- you know, one of those books that's a rehashing of the story with stills from the film? There's a fair amount of text about how the film was made, but the visuals? For such a visual film, seeing mere stills from the motion picture left me wanting more. There's literally only ONE piece of production design art from the movie in the whole book. Seeing the film in motion was a trip. Seeing still photos left me cold. If you're looking to swoon over the stars or see stills from the movie, this book is for you. If you're hoping for more... pass!"
3,Not bad but for beginners to the subject,Brennan recounts the old stories of ancient archaeology through most of this book. He sites a lot of bible quotes to reinforce his contention that we came from Mars but doesn't really give any hard evidence as to how this was possible. This book is basically a collection of other books that I have read that were more interesting. More for people who don't know too much about ancient archaeology and what to start out with the basics.
2,Little connection between the title and what is delivered.,"Although this book does present some intriquing archeological anomalies, and thought-provoking speculation, it fails to even come close to delivering the goods. The author revisits ground well-trodden ('face on Mars', ancient mysteries, mythology-as-fact), but offers nothing new. It is disjointed, and seems to have been put together hastily. Sub-par."
3,"Quick, compelling, well-researched","Brennan's book is far from the definitive book on possible extraterrestrial intervention in our species' history. But it's surprisingly cogent, fast reading that raises important questions without insulting the reader's intelligence. Brennan's thesis isn't developed into a working hypothesis; he leaves this thorny task for others to unravel. But the material here is certainly worth the few hours it takes to read ""Martian Genesis."""
3,interesting theory,this is an interesting book...and it makes you think what could have been on mars. its an easy read. i have nothing else to say about this book.
1,Am I supposed to believe this?,"How half of the archaeological sites mentioned in this book have anything to do with Mars is beyond me. If we came from Mars, then don't you think there'd be some kind of oral or written history about it? There's an oral history of Noah's flood, and of Jesus allegedly rising from the dead, but there's no mention of us coming to Earth from Mars. How could people forget such a momentous occasion?The whole premise of this book is solely based on one picture. Overall this book sucks."
1,the product is not what is represented///,"if your going to sell electronics, at least know what you are selling////"
2,don't waste your money,I purchase this for my dual sport bike. It was a waste of money. If your buying handguards spend 75 and get a decent product. These are not the quality I hoped for.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The iDOG did not quite live up to my expectations. The speaker is somewhat tinny sounding and the barking is quite annoying. However, it does do the job and is useful. It travels well and is a good on the go speaker. But I would recommend splurging for a more expensive speaker if you want quality. I would recommend this product for children and early teens. But definately not adults."
4,The Hottest Robotic Pet Around!,"Remember those potted flowers that jammed to music not too long ago? The iDog is much like that but more fun and updated for the ""Pod"" generation. Although this dog doesn't walk, it does toss it's head and swing to the beat. The cord to connect to your iPod (or any other music device) is included and you can also put it next to any speaker (which I was not aware of)--ergo, you don't have to have an iPod to enjoy this toy. All the kids want one from 10 on up it seems, and if you want to get even more hip, buy a iBag to keep it in. I'm not sure how long this fad will last, but if you're looking for something to entertain everyone this Christmas, this is it!"
3,Really Cute and Fun!,This is a great fun way to listen to your I-Pod but I wish is had a power cord that allowed it to charge while using it. I find that it eats up the batteries quickly. I ending up buying a desk top speaker set and using the i-Dog only on a fun occasion. Would I buy it again? Maybe ....
1,idog - don't buy,"It is very cute - but after a few minutes - the thrill is gone. The ""dog"" makes the same sounds - gestures over and over - and then getting him to turn off is quite a task!"
1,Not Worth It...,This toy is worthless. There is no value to it. All it does it does is wag its tail and eat up batteries. The tiny light show is horrible. Get something more usefull for your iPod. If you drop it it will break.
1,Remember the Commador Vic 20?,This toy looks like it was created in the 70's or 80's. I thought it would be cute for my daughter (age 5) but she kept saying that it looked like our neighbor's baby monitor and she is a 'big girl now.' We returned it because it did not captivate her interest. This may be fun for pre-k or younger but a karaoke machine or CD player would be a better choice.
1,Just a toy,"I bought the idog and did not expect the sound quality to be so poor. Nice decorative item, but again, sound quality is POOR!"
2,OK Fun But Save your money,"This toy is cute and that is about it. If you need a decent speaker system look elsewhere. This dog does not follow commands, he does not walk. In fact all he really does is three things. Shake his head to the music (kind of like the old coke cans and dancing flowers) and light his lights to the music he is playing through the bad speaker he posesses. THis dog is a cute novelty, but only a novelty. Buy at your own risk."
4,I dog,I think this is soo cool i cant wait to get one! Dont worry if you dont have a i pod cuz it says it hooks up to most portable mp3s! I'm going to wait for christmas but if i dont get one then i'm so gonna buy it! I cant see an 8 year old with one though maybe an 11 yaer old. I think its just the cutest thing!!!
1,Pointless,"This toy is pointless and will break down after you play with it about 10 times. Sure, it is very cute and it's a great price for a speaker, but honestly, a dog ""dancing around"". It's designed to be like real dogs. You have to ""feed"" it every hour or so with music. Tell me, why would I waste the time to do that? Also, the sound quality is horrible. If you're wondering what to get your daughter/son/niece/newphew etc. for Christmas, do not, I repeat, DO NOT get them this toy, unless they aboslutely beg you for it. This is all."
4,Very cute but Battery life is AWFUL!!,"My daughter loves her new I-Dog. She is 6 and absolutly loves it. The only problem is that the Battery Life on the thing is only SEVEN hours. Today we put new batteries in and by 7:30 she needed new ones. I thought that we must have had a defected one because she kept needing new batteries all the time but when I looked at the Hasbro website it confirmed that the battery life was 7 hours.Like I said she LOVES it and shoot I must admit I wanted one too, but not now! We can't afford all the batteries! =o) We do love it and I would recommend getting one!"
4,iDog is Fun,I bought an iDog mainly because it is cute. But I found that it's portability allows me to bring my iPod and play music from all over the house with ease. It is the perfect size and the music sounds pretty good from the little speaker. I use it almost daily.
3,A friendly companion in the car but motors a little loud....,The I-dog is very cute and a great decoration in the car or office. But the motors are a little loud when it moves. Generally not a problem when the music is turned up.
5,Hasbro i-Dog a winner with the kids!,"I purchased the Hasbro i-Dog for my 10 year old daughter. She LOVES it, and so does her 7 year old brother. We have had no problems what-so-ever. A big plus is that the batteries have been in since Christmas Eve and with numerous hours of play and we haven't had to replace a one."
4,Doritio dog,The Idog was a big hit with my son who used a Christmas gift card to purchase it. His only concern is the volume is not very loud when his Zen MP3 player is plugged into it. The dog works much better with his CD player.
5,ilove idog!,"Oh wow. This thing is not only really adorable, but also the perfect accessory for a music lover such as myself. The speaker quality really isn't that bad considering everything else the pup does. I love the dual-connector cord, it fits everything else I use my iPod with (stereo, aux cable in car, etc.) so I can easily listen to my music on any one of my stereo systems while still connected to the iDog. He's a fairly inexpensive and very amusing gadget, thank you Hasbro!"
1,A simple annoying toy,When I first saw this toy on TV I thought that it wasthe coolist thing ever. When I started to think aboutit and saw the camertial agian I thought how laim!All the adds don't realy tell you what Idog does.That's because well it doesn't do much.Idog is just a simple toy that lights up makes noisedances and has good advertiseing. After a fueminutes it becomes annoying.Many stores try to sell idog for fiffty dollers!if youy are going to bye idog at least get it for agood price!
1,NOT AN IPOD. A PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The iDog is NOT an ipod. All it does is play your music. It doesn't record and then later your thinking it;s going to play what you heard early NO thats not the point of an iDog. So do Not buy this iDog. I will say it again DO NOT BUY IT! It is a piece of TRASH!
1,no good,"when I purchase the price it is great, but after make payment next day the price go up, how can I purchase item form your company next time. everytime I purchase a lot, not 1 or two at the same item with the same item. and this month the item no needs shipping fees, so that is very good service, but that is not fair for me, because I paid lot of shipping fees for my item. So what can I do next time?"
4,iDog was a hit!!!!!,"I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter to go with her iPod and it kept her, my 10 year old niece and my 6 year old nephew busy for a good 45 minutes the first time they used it......."
4,fun but gets old,I got my idog last month. And for a few days it was the coolest thing ever. But after a bit it got kind of boring. Becuse it dose not do much. The idog is best for a young kid. not for a teen ( like me ). The idog is just a fun toy that barks all the time. but I still like to play with sammy ( thats what i named my idog).Also its says the lights chang to sute in muice you play but no matter what i play the lights stay the same corer. so i am a bit bumed about that. on the puse side the batters last a long time. But wach out wheen the batters get low the idog will keep comeing on and will not tern off ( i fond that out the hard way). And the idog is varry durable i have droped it a few times. But it stll works like new. The idog is fun for ervyone my sister loves it. The speaker works grate when its terned all the way up the whol house can hear it.
2,disappointed,I was expecting the i-dog that moved ears and paws. this must be the last season product since only the ears moved. Now I know why it was cheaper on-line than in the stores. I was disappointed.
3,fun for a while,"cute, but not much play value. My daughter just ad to have this. after playing with it a few times she side it doesn't do much, just moves back and forth.....boring."
2,2 Words - Rechargeable Batteries,"My daughter got the iDog with the IZ for her 6th bday. While the iDog is cute, it is a bit too complex for her to understand. It works well with the IZ. The biggest issues we have with it is that it eats batteries. Have had it less then 2 days and have gone through 4 AA batteries. Which, if we were using rechargable would not be that bad. What makes the battery eating iDog difficult is the access to the batteries. You will need a screw driver handy.Needless to say the IZ is staying and we are returning the iDog."
4,Hot Christmas Gift,"I have a relative that works for the Hasbro Toy Company, and she allowed me and my two sisters to try the iDog for about two weeks and to see how we liked it. I am 19, and I found it to be really nice to have on my desk. However, I have a 9 year old brother who simply loved the toy!! He thought it was so much fun to ""feed"" the toy with music. He could sit there for hours and play with this. So, if I were to reccomend the toy to a specific age range, it would have to be to grade school children. There aren't any other changes I would make to the toy. It would be nice to have it come in other colors though, similar to the way iPod mini's did. But, other than that, I think it's a really nice toy and it's a fun and interactive way to listen to music."
4,idog is a fun way for kids to enjoy their ipod music.,"I bought the idog for my daughter who is 9 and she is enjoying it very much. It has a neat colorful display, it has some interactive functions for kids to enjoy, and the sound is decent as well."
4,White iDog,"This is a cute little guy. He sits on my desk and plays my music while I am at work. If there is too much of a pause between songs, he barks or growls. At first it was funny, but now it kinda gets on my nerves as it can be distracting and startling. Overall, he really is cute. My kids love it when we take him on road trips and treat him just like an actual family pet."
2,"I have to say after reading the last review, I'm not buying it.","What good are speakers if they have no volume control? Also, they couldn't afford to put in an adapter so you can listen to your music without your batteries running out?Not good."
4,Decent but needs an extra description,"Gu is one of the best energy packs. It's tasty and it's well-designed for quick consumption (I find it less messy that Powerbar gels). This box of Gu is a great deal, how it would really help if it was mentioned in the description that over half of the packets are caffienated. I'm sure a lot of people would love the kick, but some people (like me) need to avoid caffiene due to preference or health conditions."
4,Great for hiking,"Started using Gu Energy Gels after a long hot day hike left me totally spent. Not that these replace those valuable electrolytes, but the Gu gels will give you that boost for the last few hills. These are convenient and store easily in a daypack or pocket. Good price as these run about $1 more each in retail stores. The gel is easy to get out while on the move and the taste is good-tolerable. Only downside is that if you don't get all the gel out, it is a bit sticky on your hands."
5,"Great flavor, great energy.","Even the ""plain"" flavor was much better than I expected. I had my heart set on getting the Vanilla Bean, but it was often out of stock. I opted for to try other flavors to test others and was surprised by how good tasting they all were. I actually enjoy matching my workout moods with the different flavors! Now I will just get this mixed flavors box every time."
5,Tastes Great!,Not only does gu gel give you the energy that you need but the chocolate outrage tastes great! Sometimes with other energy gels and flavors I cringe when I take it but with this one I actually look forward to it!
4,Nice to add energy,It is good to have it because:1. You can use it while running.2. Only 100 calories3. Effective in adding energy
4,Good if you like flavored slime when you run!,My husband loves these when he trains. I cannot stomach anything slimey when I run. He swears by them. Amazon has a great price on the 24 count compared to buying them individually in the stores. It is one of the better flavors out there so if you like the slime this is the one for you!
5,Favorite,Love this flavor! Can't eat more than 2 a run though. Usually eat one every 8 miles or so and one before the start
5,Gu,I'm a runner and Gu is an essential to my long runs. It also helps on those sluggish mornings when I just need a pick me up
4,Good GU,This is the first energy product I have ever used while running and doing strenuous hiking. It put the spring back in my step.
5,Arrived fairly quickly and as advertised,"I was happy with the customer service, the price, and the product was as advertised. I would definitely do business with them again."
5,Great Taste,The tri berry flavor is light and easy to digest. I like how this flavor also has caffine. I use these before my runs when I don't have time to eat.
4,Race Fuel,"I have used GU gels for triathlons, bicycle races, running, and adventure races. I like the product because it is easy to pack and offers a predictable taste and nourishment. In the middle of an event, I don't like any surprises in my food. The GU gels give a lot of options for flavors and also a mix of caffeine/no caffeine. This particular flavor, Lemon Sublime, is similar to lemon lime soda such as Mountain Dew or Mellow Yellow. Surprisingly, it is caffeine free. The GU packs can be annoying to deal with at times, as the little tab at the top comes off and used packs can be sticky. I usually place them in a ziploc bag to keep my bike bag or pockets clean."
5,Rocket Packets,I love using this while running long distances. It helps when your body is starting to beg for food and gives you a nice little jolt. I did notice that when I rely on this too heavily I cramp. Stick with water if using it as opposed to gatorade.
4,Great product,"I really like the GU's for marathons/long distance runs. It's a great variety box for those who want to try out different flavors. My only advice is to drink a lot of water with them. If I don't, they seem to give me stomach cramps. Almost like a dehydrated feeling. Other than that, I really like these gels."
4,Good Product,"Have used powergel for years and wanted to try something new. Flavor is good and has a little grittiness, which is a good thing. I will deinitely buy these again."
4,impressed,"I am impressed with gu lemon sublime. Tastes great, good consistency compared to others I've tried. I am a beginner triathalete and I notice the boost especially on the bike climbs...Good product and I'll order again."
5,My favorite energy gel for running,"After trying lots of brands and flavors, I finally settled on GU energy gel vanilla bean flavor. I find that this gel not only helps me to revive during my run, but I also like the taste and can handle without water if necessary. I use it during my half marathon training runs that are 7 miles or more and for the race itself. Great product. It's the only one I buy anymore."
5,My wife's favorite,"I like several flavors of GU Energy Gel, but Chocolate Outrage is the only one my wife uses when she runs. Tastes a little like chocolate icing and has that consistency when it is colder outside."
4,GU Gel,Best Energy Gel on the market. Tastes great and works well. The Chocolate is by far the best.
3,Expires in one month!,Gu comes with a 12 month expiration period. They sent me a 24 packet box that expired in one month. Not the quality of service I expected...
1,Despite the page label...these aren't all Roctane options,The page made it sound like I was getting a variety pack of Roctane...instead I just overpaid for a pack of GU.
5,Strawberry Banana GU,I use GU every time I run long distances (usually 5 or more miles) because they're the best energy supplement I've found for running! Strawberry banana is the best flavor I've found so far.
4,difficult to tear the opening,"The taste is not bad and the package is good for racing. However, I experienced problem tearing up the top while racing. I had to bite hard to tear it open. During a race, I wish I didn't have to be troubled by a stubborn gel pack that just wouldn't open.Also, the consistency is more jam-like. It was thick and not easy to swallow, compared to PowerBar."
5,Tasty and effective,"I use Gu for cycling and get a step function performance difference, starting at 9-12 minutes after ingestion, then ending 20-40 minutes later (20 minutes for hills, 40 for flat roads). Very effective for whatever ails my energy system."
4,Love this stuff,"This is like eating chocolate frosting out of the container. Which is to say, HEAVEN. It works well as an energy supp and I've used it during long runs, marathons and hiking at high altitude. Great buy. Will purchase again."
5,Not just for running,"Typically a marathon runner's bread a butter, I use GU most frequently for late night ice hockey games. Keeps me skating hard through the 3rd period. I initially got the variety pack to try all the flavors but settled on mint chocolate as the best. GU has a consistency that most people aren't used to but mint chocolate is certainly palatable and worth the energy kick."
4,"Superior results, great absorption.","I'm one of those people who has a stomach that just doesn't tolerate food while I'm exercising, which makes fueling before a race or just a training day a hassle to say the least. I'm also one of those people who is naturally skeptical of any ""energy"" product that comes out. I've tried a ton of those as well, mostly out of curiosity, including 5 hour energy. Nothing compares to GU Energy gels or the chewy bites, my stomach has no problem digesting these little wonder packets and the taste isn't bad either. I usually take 2 packets 30 minutes before a workout, or 1 packet of the bites, plus one gel packet if I need an extra pick me up (sometimes you don't have time for a cup of coffee). They work out great either way, as far as running long distance like over 25 miles, I've yet to use them, but some of the other reviewers seem to have experienced good results."
2,"Item is fine, seller lacks motivation.","Gu is great energy for endurance athletes and I've used it during many marathons and triathlons. The caffeine in the chocolate flavor makes it hard to sleep afterword, though.Main problem with this transaction was that the seller kept my money for several weeks before even bothering to fill the order. Totally unacceptable, and I won't order from them again."
5,The best GU flavor,I love GU - for training and racing. This is a must have for my runs over 1hr. This stuff tastes so good it gives you a little extra motivation when running the long runs!
5,Just Plain Tasty,"I've tried all the energy gels out there and my two favorites (for taste) are GU Just Plain and Hammer Gel Raspberry. Also, it works."
2,"Works ok, tastes terrible!","I thought that the new gu would taste like the old stuff but it has a pungent taste! It works ok, but the taste makes me gag. I'd recommend saving your money and sticking with the original gu."
3,its ok,the price is very goodi got it on timethe only think i didn't like is that the product can be used until feb 2014
5,My Experience,"As a Triathlete, I Just Can Recommend This Product Because It a Fast Shot Of Energy. I'm Very Happy With This Purchase."
3,Warning: Non-Caffeinated,It was unclear whether these were caffeinated or not. They are not. The consistency is thicker than Hammer Gel's and Roctanes.
5,Gu Not Gross,Does what it needs to do. I've tried other brands that taste disgusting and this one actually tastes like candy.
4,Excellent thrill ride from beginning to end,"David Morrell does it again! This is a great story about a well trained assassin, Drew MacLane, who has had enough of the killing. Seeking to be forgiven of all of his sins, he withdraws from the world as he new it and lives the life of a hermit in a monastary. After six years, someone from his past who knows all about him will stop at nothing to see that he is terminated. Being pulled back into a life of lies, betrayl, and murder, Drew is forced to return to his old ways just to survive. The chase is on and the body count rises as Drew desperatly tries to find out who is behind this. Action packed and fast paced."
4,A Correction to Another Review,"I just wanted to offer a minor correction to Mr Minde's review. He mentions ""The League of Night & Fog"" as an earlier novel than ""Fraternity...;"" ""League"" was the third novel of the trilogy, ""Fraternity"" was the second. In fact, Drew (the main character in ""Fraternity"") teams up with Saul (the surviving main character from ""Brotherhood of the Rose"") in ""League."" A minor point, I know, but I thought it was worth mentioning."
4,Good Vampire Read,I thought the book was good. I did download it for free on my Kindle and after reading it was glad that I had. It is entertaining and an easy read. I think the harsh reviews on it are strange. It really is a decent book. Was it hilarious? No. but there were some funny parts. Enjoyable
4,Cute & fun,I really liked this book. I blazed through it on a business trip waiting for airplanes and it really passed the time well! :)
4,"I like it and I will buy the author's next book. Yep, I'll pay.","I got this book because it was free, I like vampire fiction and the description intriqued me. A vampire and dentist seemed like an interesting pair. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. The main characters' romance was a bit more adolescent that I usually read, but I actually enjoyed it. A lot. I wouldn't compare Sparks to Linda Howard quite yet, but I think she'll get there. I will pay for the author's next book."
4,how to marry a millionaire,I enjoed this story and world enough that I have the original paperbook and now kindle versions. I recommend this book and the series!
1,Horrible read,"Terrible story line and terrible read. Not sure why anyone would rate this a 5 unless they have never actually read a good book. I agree with another reviewer about Roman's quote ""God's blood"" which would make for a great drinking game."
3,Just Okay,"My first Kerrelyn Sparks book. Light, humorous quick reading. The style and tone are simple and matter-of-fact.A vampire, Roman Draganesti, loses one of his fangs by biting into a doll with synthetic blood and needs to find a dentist soon or he'll be a one fanged vamp for all eternity. He is already the millionaire creator of synthetic blood that saves humans and gives vampires a morally correct food source. The doll is a recent invention to give the vampires the feel of the bite while getting synthetic blood but the plastic she's made of is just a little bit TOO tough. The dentist he meets, Shanna, is unlike any mortal he's ever met and she needs his protection because she witnessed an earlier murder and the baddies are out to get her.Just okay--with so many good vamp series out there, I doubt i'll follow this one."
1,Almost Painful,"I have a problem where I must finish a book I started. Its a flaw because God's Blood this book was terrible. The lead character was so annoying. Shanna spent the whole book in love with Roman, then out of love, then in love, then out of love. If that wasn't bad enough the lead guy, Roman, spent the whole book in love with her, then not good enough for her... you get the point. The plot was pretty dumb along with the title. I should have read the reviews. This books savings grace is that it was short. It didn't take long to put this book out of my life forever."
1,"Wanted to like it, but...","This book doesn't reinvent anything in the romance genre, but it still would have been a great read if the writer could have only breathed some life into her pages and her characters. While she had a few good ideas as far as the storyline, not giving anything away here by talking about the choco or diet blood to which some of the ""hilarious"" references might be aimed, she just never seemed to make the story become an escape for her readers. I never cared for the characters at all and I easily lost interest in the book a lot. Only purchase if it's free."
2,I must have read the wrong book...,"From all the 5 star reviews I am thinking I read a different book. This book was beyond terrible. I kept thinking since it had 5 stars that the book would eventually get better, it never did. Had I know that I would have never bothered finishing it. The plot and the main character, Roman, had such potential for a fresh story but in the end it turned into a mess. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1, was for the potential."
1,God's Blood it's Horrible,"I have to write this review just to add another one star rating to try to offset the 5 star ones. I have to admit I couldn't even get to the point where there was an interesting twist to the story. The ""God's blood"" repeated over and over again by the H drove me absolutely crazy. There was nothing about the beginning part of this book, that I made it through, to make me be able to continue to read it. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Don't waste your money. I don't know how so many people could have given this book a good review???????"
2,it started out strong,"at first i loved how well written this story was. strong plot and strong characters but then it shifted and started to fizzle. it seemed as if the author had a deadline and stopped putting thought into the story. it became cheesy and the ending reminded me of a sit com. quickly wrapped in a happy ending while the bad guy cries out ""you have not seen the last of me!"" and the canned laughter laughs along with the other main characters. quite the dissapointment."
3,good story but...,"I liked the story but the over use of the phrase ""God's Blood"" was sickening. I would think that even a vampire could come up with something different to say from time to time. In one area on my kindle this phrase was used 1 time on each page for several pages. Please teach this vampire to say, good grief, oh my, anything else...."
4,it was a good read,the book was a good read! it was a cheap read so .....really u cannot beat the fact that it was cheap and good. If would recommend this title
4,Go for it,"I felt for the charming Roman Draganesti, he was a gentle and misunderstood. All he ever wanted was love. Oh and he didn't want to look stupid... lets hear it for the damsel in distress. Great book I enjoyed every moment."
3,Pretty funny :),I had fun reading this book. I didn't think I would like it but I really did. I enjoyed all the characters especially the Scots men :) I loved that they talking with their accents that was fun to read things they way they would say them. This was a fun and funny story. I'm excited to follow up with Shanna and Roman to find out what happens next for them :)
3,"Great Promise, Failed to Deliver","This book had such promise. I thought the title was a little silly but it got pretty good reviews so I thought it was worth trying. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75% of the book, but then the book changed. It stopped being smart and funny. It got downright juvenile in the writing and suddenly the characters turned into silly adolescents. It almost seemed that the author was trying to rush the ending in order to get it done OR failed to do some serious proof-reading before finalizing it. I ended up not even being able to finish the book, and being an extrememly picky reader, I doubt I'll pick up another book by this author."
2,Blech!,"One of the silliest books I've read. Well, read half of, for I couldn't even finish it. Harlequin romance for vampires. I thought it would be cute. It wasn't; it was cutsey. Maybe something for a teen with low expectations as to a book with a decent plot that is moderately well written. This is neither. Total waste of six bucks. I'm embarrassed to even write this review showing I purchased this dreck.I give this one and a half stars. Two was being very kind. How this got a four star average is beyond me."
2,Mildly entertaining premise - horrible writing,"I really could not get into this book because of the constant use of ""Sheesh"" and ""Jeez"" by the female protagonist and endless ""God's Blood"" by the main Vampire character. The extremely cliched use of what the author presumes to be a Scottish brogue also did not help. The clincher was when the over 500 year old Vampire discloses that he is really a virgin and has only ever had mind sex. Honestly !"
1,disappointed,"I was hoping for so much better after reading the many good reviews. Possibly it was a question of timing. I read this book right after finishing Queen of Shadows by Dianne Sylvan - which i found to be a truly fabulous story. By comparison, How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire felt embarrassing to read. Another reviewer used the word ""cutesy"" and that's probably quite apt. And i agree with whoever made the point about the use of the phrase ""God's blood"" - I was reading on a my iTouch and at one point the term was used once per screen for several screens in a row! Anyway, if you are in the mood for something campy and silly, this might be what you're looking for; the book does have a decentish pace with lots happening."
1,Not for me......,"I've read many different type of Vampire books and seemed to enjoy most. I just couldn't get into this book. The writing style, story was a weird read for me. I like Sookie Stackhouse, The Blackdagger Brotherhood series, Twilight series, Anita Blake series something along those are what I tend to go for."
3,"Strong title, weak story","I want to say that you should not judge a book by it's cover. I am guilty of this one. But lets face it, the cover is the first thing you see, if you like the front, you look to the back, and then if it passes your inspection, you bring it home. It obviously passed for me. It's a quick read. It's not entirely unpleasant, in fact, the bones of the story are quite good. It's just that the writing is so dry. I have read many vampire romance novels, and if you compare it to the whole, it will fall flat. If you don't compare it to anything, I would probable like it more. So as long as you're not a big vampire romance fan, I would buy it, and enjoy it. I would think twice before buying this one if you're a big fan of the genre."
4,Parents can get a lot wrong,Enjoyed reading how Roman didn't want to turn Shanna and how they live in the moment is truly the whole meaning of love.
2,How to marry a millionaire vampire,"I guess I was expecting a book with alot more humor then this one had, although this book did have some humor. The vampire hero was so ordinary. He could have been any succesful business man in any harlequin novel. It was very slow paced and it took the heroine forever to figure out the hero was a vampire. Roman and Shanna were just not that interesting as a couple."
2,Utter crap - albeit very entertaining crap.,"Had me hooting with laughter at the overwrought and downright atrocious clichés. Seriously someone published this!?! I skimmed through pages and pages of mindless drivel, chuckled over the interaction between the leads and resisted hurling my kindle out the window at the frequent repetition of lines. The author is a good storyteller but the publisher deserves a damn good slap for not editing this harder. I won't buy any of the others but I do foresee myself reading bits of this for a laugh. So as I said, it was entertaining. It's just I could have cut half the book out and not missed anything."
4,Good Sunday afternoon book,"This was the first book I've read by this author, I'm a diehard any book with a vampire person. Very cute, good ending, kind of left you hanging, but I think this will be the first of a series, she introduced some characters that have story lines worth pursuing. Worth buying to read during these long drab winter days."
4,Worth the time,A good read. Easy to get hooked into the story. Likable characters-primary and secondary. Lots of funny lines. If you're looking for a good story to pass the time and entertain you this is a good choice.
4,I am surprised,"Though I do agree with some of the negative reviews, the heroine can be annoying at times, bold as brass, and overly sarcastic, but I really did identify with her (which may not be the greatest thing, but it is painfully true).It wasn't ""Not-put-downable"", but it was definitely good.and the use of ""Gods Blood"" was overly annoying too, but the Scotsmen clad in kilts made it exciting.It wasn't a literary genius at work, but I read to be entertained, and I was. However, I have not read romance novels of this genre before, so I may not be the best judgeBut for free on Kindle, I thought it was AWESOME."
4,Fun Read!,A really fun read. Story moves along quickly with great humor that is unexpected in a vampire novel. Recommended it to family members.
2,Weak,"The story is weak, and the writing is not the best. I deleted it off my Kindle. I know free is tempting, but honestly skip it."
2,Cheesy,"I can't believe I bought this book. It's one of those books you read it till you get half way through, because you're expecting it to get better. It doesn't. The sense of humor in it is cheesy. You want a book thats hilarious with Vampires, demons, etc... Pick up a Kresley Cole book or a J.R. Ward."
2,Wasted potential...,"I was looking forward to this book and was intrigued by the story-line, which was very interesting in the beginning, but one third of the way through, it just lost it for me. The intriquing story-line fizzled and turned into predictable mush. There was no humor and so help me, if Roman said, ""God's blood"" one more time, I'd have thrown my Kindle across the room... But, I love my Kindle, so I didn't do that. Had it been an actual book, I would have. :)"
4,How To Marry A Millionaire Vampire,Great Quick Read!!!!I read the Second book first Vamps in the City. So I just had to find this one.Characters like Shanna and Roman are wonderful and you just hope that things work out. The supporting cast of characters are as colorful and enteraining as you would find in any book.The Bad guys make you want them to get what is coming to them.If you are looking for something that is enjoyable to read this book is a good grab. Having read this one and the next I think that this will be a series of books that will get lots of attention.
3,My review,I liked this book but there was I did not really like the heroine that much. Roman went out of his way to bend over backwards so she had everything she needed. He tried hard to keep her safe. He almost desperately tried to get her to love him and yet she never thought about any of that through out the book. She knew the mafia was after her and yet she ran because she was jealous over another woman. Yeah I agree she should have been upset about the women but she should have asked him about it instead of hauling ass. Especially knowing she could get killed or get other people killed it seemed like she acted fairly petty. Once she found out he was a vampire she had a right to be upset but even when she decided he was the good guy she still spent most of the book making excuses about why he wasn't good enough. Personally I think he was too good for her and I didn't like her.
2,God's Blood.,"I was thrilled to find a vampire book that had the word ""hilarious"" in the description, and it was free, so even better. Then I started reading it. I get why it's free. If Roman didn't say ""God's blood"" on every other page, I'll eat my Kindle. It would make a great drinking game, not a great read. And yes, Roman is a monster, forsaken by God...we get it already. As for the ""hilarious""...WHERE? The only mildly entertaining thing that happened was Roman losing a fang in a sex doll. That's it. Glad it was free because I would have been royally ticked if I had paid money for it."
2,"Eh...not horrible, but not good","I am a big vampire fiction reader and have read many other vampire romance/adventure novels in the past. Although this books keeps you somewhat interested you never really dive into the story. It's too cliche and everything seemed too convenient. All the characters lack depth, and when she tries to make each one quirky it comes off as trying too hard. One guy was too Russian, One girl was too Parisian, Another guy was too nervous. Most books have a way of expressing themselves and you can imagine how the main character looks, acts and feels, with this main character I kept changing her in my head about 50 times. Was she smart? Dumb? Ugly? Who knows! Half way through the book nothing exciting has happened, and when something exciting DOES happen it falls short. I've read fan fiction better than this!However, if you like fluff than this may be the book for you it does have some cute moments and again it is a romance novel."
3,how to marry a millionaire vampire,"Its a good story and thats why I rated it a 3, otherwise the title has nothing to do with the story. No female is plotting to marry a millionaire vampire whatsoever and that really is terrible. It set me up to read a really good story and I did but not what I had expected. What I got was the usual girl in trouble and vampire on a white steed coming to the rescue and I got this story for free and I still feel gypped."
3,"The main character must have said the phrase ""god's blood"" over 1000 times","This book was ok. Defineetly on the lower scale of writing. I liked the story, but it was not very well written. If I had played a drinking game based on how many times Roman say ""God's blood"" I would be dead from alcohol poisoning"
3,Fairly entertaining,"I received a Kindle for Christmas and ""How To Marry..."" was one of the first books I got. I loved the idea/plot of this book but there was something about it that made me feel like this author had never written before although I know that's not true. There were times I thought I would scream if Roman said ""God's blood"" one more time but all in all the book was pretty good. It wasn't one of those books that I would find myself wanting to read again and again but I'm glad I got it."
3,"Good performance, but disappointing sound","The sound quality of the concerto was particularly disapponting. The piano seems very distant in the sound stage.This apparently was a 44 khz digital recording done back in the early eightties. I have generally been happy with SACDs made from old analog, tape recordings. But SACD discs upsampled from older digital recordings are proving to be disappointing. I would avoid this disc if you have recently purchased an SACD and are looking to build up your library as I have been."
2,Oddly I had the opposite experience than previous reviewer,"My wife has a version of the ""Emperor"" by the LSO and Kovacevich and I had bought this. We did a comparison today. We both loved the Kovacevich version but the recording had a very high noise floor, however the instruments sound very real.This performance was lethargic, un-engaging and dry, while Kovacevich was the complete opposite. His was emotive and involving and you felt drawn in. I couldn't help but wanting to speed up the performance from the BSO. It was too sticatto, too smooth. The sound was extremely clean and clear. Great seperation of instruments, deep and wide soundstage as though you are rear of mid hall. However, like I said before, completely uninvolving to my wife and I at least."
1,"A boring, one hour waste of cash!","Come on Jackie - this gets an ""F"" - what's going on? Lately your stuff is getting so dull. These books, 4 at $4.00 each are terrible and also a very expensive way to be bored."
5,Brains of the world unite!,"For anyone who has ever been called a nerd, geek or brain, this is our show. I actually have a sister like Quinn, and I can really relate to Daria. I especially love her deadpan comments and her constant mocking of her parents and other authority figures. This video rocks! Does anyone know if there will be any others released?"
4,MTV's Daria video 1997,"I highly recommend this Daria video. It was humorous and very well done. I have only been a fan for a month now, and since I don't have cable here I rushed to buy this video, and found it well worth the price. Definitely more realistic and has better scripts than the more recent episodes."
4,A little taste of murder and Hamlet!,"Reginald Hill is an author to be reckonned with in the British procedural genre, and his long-running Dalziel and Pascoe series is a winner. Any of the many books is a fine example of intelligent writing. This book is not a disappointment. It is a book where Pascoe figures a bit more prominently than Dalziel, but we do have Andy there in key spots. It gives us lots of examples of his blustery non-sequitors. Dalziel and his crew are trying to unmask the Yorkshire choker who has a taste for the Elizabethan bard (in particular the play ""Hamlet""). We also have a clan of gypsies to help make things interesting. This is intelligent writing that keeps you guessing until the end. Hill has an uncanny ability to set his novels so realistically, and his very human characters help to reel us in. Don't pass up this series."
4,"What do you think, Peter?","As a fan of the PBS series about Dalziel and Pascoe, I thoroughly enjoyed the narration of Colin Buchanan, who plays Pascoe, in this audio version of the novel. Actually, this one should be entitled Pascoe and Dalziel, as Peter plays the major role in this investigation of a series of stranglings. Witty, humane, and entertaining, Reginald Hill does his usual admirable job tackling such issues as racism and prejudice. Gypsies, divorce, and adolescent mistakes all figure prominently in this mystery. Buchanan's dialects and voices make differentiating among characters easy for the listener. Very enjoyable."
1,Lasted Less Than 3 Months,"I had my Pollenex DM 209CR for ""almost"" 3 months when the bracket that connects the unit to the shower arm cracked, water went spraying in every direction! - cheap plastic! Don't waste your money."
3,I have been drumming for 10yrs..,This DVD is great if you like amature rock to jazz drumming. It only fetures two pro drummers and is low video quality.
1,currently have the phone,"I have this phone now.I recently purchased it off on ebay.I bought it for the looks and the sleek design.It was working well for a while,then it kept on dropping my calls and it would freeze up on me.I realized that it was the software causing all this trouble.Now I have a purchase a new phone.I am not satisfied with this phone.I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone."
3,"I prefer video two, for track two . . .","This is straight-up bootleg. But, since there aren't copyright laws for videos yet or probably never, there is nothing illegal about this DVD. But, as others put it, it's very low quality. But, it does have the videos from the Elephunk album, plus videos before Fergie joined.I'm a little bothered though, that the tracks (videos) on the DVD don't match to the digital tracks on the DVD. Meaning, if you press forward or next track on your remote, it won't line up with the videos. Also meaning, a bit a of hassle.Overall, decent. The videos are good in themselves. Watch on! . ."
2,poor.,this video is not what I expected. I take it. It is bootleg! the audio sucks there is no menu. the videos are not in order and some videos weren't on it. Do NOT BUY THIS. I have ordered many times through amazon. BUT this is the worst product i have ordered. JUST trying to help others. REPEAT DON'T BUY THIS.
4,Sweet Betty Reigns!,"This powerhouse blues singer delivers a powerful musical journey. Her deep soulful pipes rip through some blues, gospel and soul. I love the vibe of Live and Let Live. This cd never fails to lift my spirits. Here is hoping this woman gets her due."
4,Magnetic switch,I used this product for my safe... I used rope light inside to light it and wanted the lights to come on when the door opened for quick access... the switch works great...make sure to wire it to DC current only! I gave it four stars because the first one that came did not work...Amazon made good and sent me a new one at no charge with two day shipping...so I would give Amazon 5 stars on service.
1,"Too fragile, shorts will fuse switch in place","I was using these to make cabinet lights - so when you open the door, the led lights would come on.They work as intended (Normally Closed means that electricity will flow when the magnet is far away) but I've had 2 of these ruin because of a short occurring after I was sodering the leads to the LED strip. The switch is now in the ALWAYS on - meaning that the magnet has no effect, thus ruining the entire configuration.The LED strip I was sodering it to was 15"" long, so very minimal amount of current flowing through.Buyer beware - if you are a good soderer, and you can somehow protect the leads, the product will work as advertised, but any problems and you just through $8 down the drain. (I'm counting S&H; as part of the price)"
1,A very tiny guide book or a very big brochure,"The miniscule contents of this book reminded me of those tiny books you see at bookstore checkout counters. Nothing more than you would find in a handful of pamphlets at a police station. It's an assortment of tips like, ""Call 911 when someone attacks you."" I expected more insight, more psychology. From the other review, I expected real-life stories from which to debunk myths and glean profound insights. No such luck. It appears these police officers just threw together safety brochures they picked up here and there. I teach women's personal protection, and books like these are inspiring me to seriously consider writing my own."
1,Keep your money.,"I was very disapointed when I read this book. It looked great, with a beautiful cover... Remember this old adage : ""Don't judge a book by his cover ""? It is true that this book offer great tips, but there are the kind of tips you already know (even if you know nothing in the field of self-defense). This book contains no more information that the free pamphlets you can find in your local police stations. Self-defense is a vital subject : don't waste your time (altough this book is read in twenty minutes...) with this one. There are many other book about this subject you can find, and believe me, better ones for sure."
3,ok but lots of news clips that were too detailed for me,"this was a decent book but i found the characters uninteresting for the most part and couldnt get attached. i also found the in-between chapters full of newpaper articles distracting - unless you know a rediculous amount about egyptian current events and politics it can be confusing. overall an ok read, but i wouldnt recommend it."
5,"NoT widescreen, but almost one.","I didn't want this monitor, the company send me the wrong one. I was kind da so called Bull_dog -mad. I did have complaint file on the company ""Computer Brain"". They Had Fast Shipping, but lack of ensure the product is cosumer demand.About the monitor. Even is was not widescreen, but wide lenght is longer than the height by2-4 inch. It pretty big monitor for good price. you can watch movie in widescreen, by had the black bar top/bottom ont the screen, It good for PC Gaming, movie, TV, and Next-Gen Video game console.It had contrast, brightness, and other options to control change the image.Make-sure if you buy for many purpose of used not just one purpose."
5,Easy read,I haven't finished the book yet but so far so good! It's an easy read and I read it when I have time. Small enough to carry in a bad and take with me everywhere. So far I've learned alot and hope to finish it soon!
2,Book Summary: save money,"If you already are a saver or slightly financially savvy, this book is useless: Its a book to convince you to save money and contribute to your 401k. It uses alot of embelished examples: if you put $2000 in an account now and it earns 10% interest look how much money you have when you are 65!!! True, but anyone out there know of a stock or bond or CD earning 10% a year? Or if you buy a house now and it doubles in value, what a great investment. True, spend 50K now and get out 100K. If you pay rent, you lose that money: but by owning you also have property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, repairs like a roof, interest on the home loan to consider, not to mention, do you live in a housing market that will double in 20 years? The vast majority of the country does not."
5,Smart Women Finish Rich,"I recently got divorced and needed some financial advice. I bought David Bach's book ""Smart Women Finish Rich"" and was hooked right away. He gives sound advice in an easy to read format. I have made several changes for the better (i.e. saving for retirement, deciding to go back to college) since reading his book. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Great but Missing Something,"This is a great book. I enjoyed reading it but somewhere towards the end the author lost me. He puts a lot of focus on managing the money you make, investing towards retirement, dreams and security but there is nothing in the book about managing debt.Everything he talks about in the book, if you are in debt, they are worthless. However, this is a book worth reading because too many women out there are waiting for prince charming to handle everything for them. This book is a wake-up call for women, single, divorced, married or widowed to take care of themselves."
5,This is a must read!,"I also picked this book up by accident at a local book store. I saw the title and thought that maybe this book would help me get my financial life in order. I am 20 years old and thought that the best time to start was now. I was hesitant to invest and save for retirement, but after reading this book, I'm glad that I have started putting money away. Mr. Bach explains terms in a way that are easy to understand. I was intimidated by words and phrases like '401(k)' and 'money market accounts'. After reading this book, I feel like I have a much better understanding of these concepts and can put my new found knowledge to good use in securing my financial future. This is a must read for anyone who is looking to better understand the investment world and start saving smartly. It is a great book for women, but it can also be shared with your male relatives and acquaintances. It is just an all around great book!"
2,Beware!,"Warning bells started ringing in my head when early on the book the author recounts how he commiserated with one of his female seminar attendants that of course she doesn't have time to manage her personal finances, who does? At that point, I knew the book wasn't for me and I started skimming. He later (surprise!) suggests that readers seek the service of financial planners, even though he admits that they could cost 1-3% of your portfolio value annually. Other infractions include promoting variable annuities (he downplayed the cost and asserted that any costs would be recouped with the annuity's tax advantage!) and using VERY sloppy math to supposedly illustrate the Roth IRAs superiority to the Traditional IRA. The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star was that there was some standard common advice, such as every woman should know where her family's money is stashed and other similar advice."
4,Smart women finish rich,"I am almost finished with the book, and it is a very interesting book. I liked the Automatic millionaire more, but this book does so into more depth about investments and saving money. It is a good read, and worth the money for the information."
5,A must-read for women who want to live well,"I was astounded at how much I gained from this book: not only have I been able to better define >why< I want to be financially secure, but I have been given the hope that even on a low salary, I can still make a difference in my way of living and increase my security for the future. David Bach presented all his ideas very effectively and thoroughly. Reading (and implementing) the strategies presented will forever change my life. The best part is, anyone can do it!"
5,It literally changed my life.,"I can't recommend this book enough. I have given it as a gift to friends. I was a financial mess after a divorce left me with two children and a bankruptcy. I picked this book up while trying to survive a long delay at an airport. From the moment I started, I couldn't put it down. Completely accessible and filled with relatable stories, this book is a crash course on personal finance for the ignorant. By following the practical guidelines, I am now independent and in control of my money, not the other way around."
5,smart women finish rich,well i must say that the book has helped me very much with my finances and I highly recomend it to all my frieds ! my daughter was very pleased when I gave her one of the books as a present she is currently reading it.thank very muchgloria jimenez
5,"Awesome, highly recommend","I picked up this book because I like to read as much as I can about investing. I thought I knew it all--but learned a ton from this book. This book is for every single woman out there. Being financially literate is as important as having good health. It is vital to get finances in order and this book explains how, is easy to followm and Bach makes the topic of money and saving a lot of fun. A must have in your library."
1,Utterly Worthless,"This author should write a book entitled ""How to write an utterly useless book, then package, market, hype it such that it hits the bestseller list."" If you don't beleive me, go to Barnes & Noble and skim through it.This book does not contain a single original idea.Here are some of the key lessons -1. Money you save now will be worth more later (assuming the interest exceeds inflation). Wow...really? Thanks for that insight.2. Take advantage of your 401k.3. If you don't have a 401K get an IRA.4. Audit your expense trail and uncover needless epenses (e.g. daily lattes).That's it. I am shocked that this worthless POS has hit the bestseller list.Dear author - PLEASE write a book explaining how you pulled it off.JW"
1,I read the comments and I did not find anyone telling about the results,"You all praising this book, how smart it is written, how valuable. But what are the fruits? Show them. Who can say that because of this book she got out of debts, bought a new house and moved from Harlem to 5th Avenue? Or smth like this? It seems to me that it is one more well-marketed book with no real advice in it. Everyone who wrote a review seems like struggling surviving individuals. I don't wanna join you guys if so. Please, who can tell any real outcome they had after reading this book, and then I will buy it."
1,Smart Women Finish Rich,"In a word: Great!Love this book! Along with Rich Dad Poor Dad (Robert Kiyosaki) The Automatic Millionaire, also by Bach, These books have really changed my life.I'm even starting to carry cash again! Ha! It's incredible that simple, little things like writing down your expenses on a daily basis really changes your relationship with money, how you spend your time, etc., can change not only your bank account but your financial I.Q.I'm now going to enroll in Personal Finance classes and courses on Investing.Thank you Mr. Bach for sharing your knowledge and inspiring me in so many ways.Sincerely,Felicia"
2,not so straight,"I ordered three of these bands because they seem like a cheap bi-metal band with potential. I have a Grizzly dust collector, and it's a decent machine for not much money and so I figured what the heck?Well, the band has some twist in it. I have not had this problem with Suffolk bands but I have had it with Olson. The band does not run straight - it wobbles and has a bigger kerf than is specified for the blade, which sucks. It seems reasonably sharp -- it had no trouble resawing 6"" marblewood and 4.5"" greenheart. I imagine its durability will be about on par for bi-metal blades. The weld seems okay and is reasonably smooth. But the wobble is just unacceptable. I am hoping the other blades will be flatter."
3,That's right.,"The product itself is great, but that flimsy attachment broke right off for me too. I am so angry that I taking it right back to the store."
2,Limited application,"This is too small to be anything other than a hand steamer for wrinkled clothes when one is traveling. At that, it spits out water when it's heated. It should be advertised with that limit on it. It is much too small to use over straight fabrics like bedspreads, linen, bedskirts, which is why I purchased it. I wish I had not purchased it. Deluxe Fabric Steamer it is not."
1,"Holds little steam, works poorly","I was very disappointed with this iron. It does not hold enough water to steam more than a few square inches of fabric. It took an hour to do one shirt, and it was still wrinkled. The water tank holds so little that it must be refilled every 2 or 3 minutes. I would have returned it, but was traveling. I just use it now as an iron, and would rather have had a regular shaped iron, which would do a better job of ironing. Forget it as a steamer. Total waste of money. Hate it."
1,Lousy product and lousy customer service...stopped working after 20 uses!,"I bought my Conair Hand Steamer a short while ago. At first, it worked great. I used it about 20 times over the course of a few months and then it completely stopped working! The motor did not pump the water from the reservoir to the iron. It is a piece of crap! Furthermore, I contacted the company via email and got no answer...not even a recognition of receiving my complaint. Lousy product and lousy customer service. I do not recommend wasting your $$$ on this steamer. Save your money and buy something that will work more than 20 times!"
5,BABYMOTHER,"I REALLY LIKE THE MOVIE AND I WAS HOPING TO GET THE SONUDTRACK FROM YOU BUT,YOU DO NOT HAVE A MAILING ADDRESS AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL HAV IT OUT SOON.THANK YOU FROMSHIRLON C"
5,recommendation,"a friend told about this book, from her narrations I got interested in the book, but where I am, is my problem of geting one. I told that my friend who lives in USA and by name Shamirah Alhassan to try and get me one,but she complained is not easy. and from her narrations about the book entaice me to talk about the book.But any other means that can let me have one of the book would be much appreciated. thank you."
1,COMMERCIAL GARBAGE,"I was very dissapointed with this release I never thought Id see the day when Flex went commercial but it happened and it happened in the worst way this album is the absolute worst commercial garbage I have ever heard sure if your a commercial MTV radio rap listener this is a five star album But this is what id expect from some one like DJ Clue not Funk Flex. The only good track is the Biggie Tupac freestyle. Flex really let the underground heads down on this one because after listening to mixtapes 1,2 and 3 which are all clasics numerous times I have to say that this album is the most unlistenable piece of trash that I have come across in quite some time. Where you at Flex have those clothing endorsements and corporate sponsorships gone to your head GET IT TOGETHER MAN!!!!!! WE NEED YOU!!!!!! Peace to all of the real reviewers who are not afraid to speak their minds when an album truly sucks"
2,Weak...,"ick...this album is garbage. So many big names, yet so many weak tracks. The Pac/Biggie Freestyle is the dopest cut on the whole album. ""If I Get Locked Up"" by Eminem & Dr. Dre is a decent cut, if only for Em's lyrics, once you hear it a few times, it'll get old. ""True"" by Meth is a decent song, nothing spectacular. ""Dem Want War"" by Raekwon is one of my favorites, but it's too short. ""Ill Bomb"" is a dope cut, I don't like LL too much, but the beat is hot. I just named all the semi-good songs. Everything else is just pants. Skip this album, pick up Flex's Mixtapes, 1-3 if you don't have them."
4,The Tunnel is a good party album,"Funkmaster Flex is a good DJ. On The Tunnel him and fellow DJ Big Kap assemble the biggest names in hip hop. This is definetly a great cd to get a party started. The best songs are Real G's with Snoop Dogg. He raps freestyle over Notorious B.I.G. beats provided by Flex. Other songs that are good are the 2Pac/Biggie live freestyle, but too bad it's short, Raekwon on Dem Want War, a rare rap artist to be featured on this kind of mixtape. Method Man's song is okay, but it isn't produced by Flex or the RZA too bad! Funkmaster Flex and Big Kap produced maybe like 5 songs on it but the others are done by Rockwilder, who produces the crappy Jay-Z song and Mannie Fresh who produces the Cash Money Millionaires song. LL Cool J's song is pretty tight. Good beats good production. Other than those songs that's about all that is good on this mixtape. It is a great cd to get a party started."
5,Flex does it again,"I really don't understand how anyone could not love this CD, I don't know anyone who owns this CD that has put in another CD since they bought it, and I know quite a few people who own it. Even the people who don't like the CD have admitted that the Biggie/Tupac Freestyle and If I Get Locked Up are both phat tracks. I can't believe no one has mentioned track 6 yet, True with Method Man and E-Dub is by far the best track on the whole album. This CD is worth buying just for that track."
5,They should have called it the Furnace....tight!,"This new one from Funkmaster flex and Dj Kapp is their tightest cd yet. It's not much dj's out there besides clue, and Kapri that can hold it down in hip/hop...but with this cd......Flex and Kapp will be at the top for a while. The songs here to look out for are from:.....Mary J., Jay-z, Ruff Ryders, Dre + Eminem, Redman . MOst of the tracks are good though and my Fav. track is with Dre and Eminem....the beat is crazy.If u never heard flex....get this! If u just looking for a tight mix cd period...then u should stop reading and starting going to the store or start clicking on the order button!"
4,Nice Looking--Handle with Care,"This pillow sham was purchased for my daughter--a big Saints fan. It is attractive, and she liked the fabric. One word of caution--wash by hand or on cold/gentle cycle to keep the printing from cracking. It was well worth the price and will make your Saints fan happy--even if the team isn't having a good day!"
1,Not impressed.,I have better body lotion for my face. This cream is a waste of money in my opinion. Different skin might do differently though. This is just my experience. I take CoQ10 capsules so my guess is I really don't need the cream.
2,moisturizer,I have been using this moisturizer for the pass 4 weeks and while it does moisturize I haven't noticed any improvements made by the claims of this product. Also not a fan of the scent.
2,"the clock looked like Light/Medium OAK in the picture, was dark wood in reality. Wasn't worht sending back.","the clock looked like Light/Medium OAK in the picture, was dark wood in reality. Wasn't worht sending back. Be careful."
3,From this moment on,"I am wanting to buy From this moment on, but I am looking for a Karaoke version that has the spoken part at the beginning of the song. Does this version have that spoken part at the beginning?"
3,passable cheap band,"I got a handful of these bands when I was trying to save money. They were not all straight, some were a bit twisted. Welds were okay, cut reasonably fast, lifetime was about what you'd expect from an average cheap blade. If $$ are tight you can get by with these. Just don't expect to be able to resaw your expensive exotics for maximum yield."
2,"Good toy, but not good collectible.","If you want a toy, then go ahead buy this. But if you want a collectible scout figure, forget it. The figure only articulates at the neck (up down only) the shoulder and hips. The elbows and knees don't bend. So you can't make it stand straight. The speeder bike is so-so. As I said, a good toy, but not a good collectible even though it costs less than a single figure itself."
3,Good lenses but--,"quality has dropped in the Serengeti line.I have owned Serengeti sunglasses for years and have bought many pairs but lately have been noticing a lack of product quality.The four pairs of Aviators I own have a insentient tendency to lose frame screws. I can't count the number of times I have tightened screws and a couple of weeks later have the screws fall out. Also the eye-pieces or rests that ride on your nose have lately been falling apart.Right now I have a pair of Aviators that needs screws, a Georgetown and another pair that need nose pieces. The kicker is that these are fairly new glasses.Bad to pay the price for what you would expect to be excellant sunglasses and have cheap four or five dollars sunglasses have better durability."
2,Slightly Boring and very undetailed,"This book, though pleasing to read is slightly (and annoyingly) boring - it is written in a way like ""he goes here"", ""he goes there"", ""he then goes there and does this"".It has detail to an extent, but in 70-ish pages, the author explained little. This book is being stretched out, when indeed it could be kept together in out book making it exciting and INTRESTING."
5,Very sharp and very long lasting quality knievs!,"I highly recommend to anyone who wants, needs, or is searching for knives to would be worth the price and last very long!!!!!"
4,Fun updated Frogger!,This modern 3-D update on the classic arcade game is very enjoyable. It is perfect for kids and even adults who aren't advanced enough for some of the faster paced technical games that are out there. There are plenty of levels so it doesn't get boring and is complicated enough to make it challenging without being overwhelming.
3,Frogger Beyond the pond,I brought this game and I have problems with it. I have no dataon it I put on the xbox and it won't let me play the game and I have not anyother problem with my other xboxs games.
