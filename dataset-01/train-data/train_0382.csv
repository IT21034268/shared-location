5,Some of everything you'll love.,"I agree with all the five star ratings! This book has it all. Interesting characters, plenty of adventure, suspense, surprises, sexy romance and a touch of magic in a unique South American setting. Definitely a page turner."
4,Nice read.,"I enjoyed this read, it is not overwhelmingly supernatural which makes it easy to get into if you're not a paranormal romancer.It has a good story line and dips into native beliefs and acts along with action and suspense and love."
4,Cultural flavor!,A great storyline with the search for the elusive orchids she once saw. A little mystic with the culture of the rainforest. A budding romance with definate sizzle (and more sizzle). Also full of mystery and suspense. A bit more graphic than I likebut by the time I got to it I was wrapped up in the plot and couldn't discard it.
3,Not the rapture I expected,"I discovered Glenna McReynolds with ""The Chalice and the Blade"" and was blown away by her thorough creation (or recreation, to some) of the Celtic and magical era of the English countryside. The other two books in that series, ""Dream Stone"" and ""Prince of Time"" were equally as impressive, well thought-out and executed.So I had high expectations for ""River of Eden,"" but should have known when I saw it published only in paperback that I was in for an entirely different experience. This was a decent story, exciting and with a little steamy romance, but not at all the emotional and dreamy fiction created in the former series.""The Chalice and the Blade"" left an impression on me, and changed the face of the romance genre a bit. This novel contained none of that power."
4,Great new storyline,"I particularly enjoyed the totally new storyline of the plot. A definite ""read it again sometime"". Tara Janzen is a consistantly good read."
3,DOA,"Mine arrived DOA. If I installed either the amp or pre-amp portion, it destroyed my analog reception and removed all traces of digital reception. It is a well reviewed product so I'm tempted to order another but I wouldn't have expected both pieces to be defective or either piece to actually block reception. That they both did makes me suspicious of their quality process."
2,Not impressed price vs. performance,I have a $20 amp from Walmart that works almost as good. 2 bars difference on channels. For the money it cost almost 4 times that of my old amp and just isn't worth the money in my opinion.
2,Great while it lasts,"I've bought three of these over the last year, two for indoor use and one for outdoor. They work as advertised until some sort of a power surge comes along, like the power going off and on. Then it's all over: you have a nice 2-piece expensive paperweight. I'll buy a Winegard next time and see how that one lasts. This one I can't recommend unless you operate it from a backup UPS."
2,Disappointed From the Start,"Be advised that you will not be getting the item pictured here. One of the main reasons I ordered this product was because it had inputs for both UHF and VHF, however, the CM-7777 that I received only has one input and one output. It looks exactly likeChannel Master CM-7778 Titan Medium-Gain Mast Mounted Preamplifier.This thing may work great but it is not what I was expecting and that is very irritating."
1,deceptive discription,this product is not the same as pictures or described. it is the old model not new as described. if you want an old style amp. this is the place.
1,Disappointed,"Installed the preamp per the enclosed instructions. It worked for twenty minutes and then failed completely. The worst part of this was having to take down the antenna for a second time because of the preamp failure. I bought this item because Channel Master has been in the TV business for a long time, and I felt quite sure it would be a quality product. I was highly disappointed. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
1,Customer Service At Channel Master Terrible,"I bought this off of Amazon warehouse store. It came in the mail not working. I climbed to the top of my tower numerous times to trouble shoot (not fun). I sent back to Channel Master. They have the most terrible return and service people. If you ever have a problem with their products, watch out for a long delay and terrible communication. Their phone and email service were both bad. Do yourself a favor and buy Wineguard. They are above reproach and value their customers. I have bought with both companies and have had returns with both companies."
1,DOA,After going through all the steps for installation it was quite disappointing to go from 21 channels and hoping to just get a more consistent signal to two channels. I sent it back and choose a different model hoping they can manage to ship units that work.
1,Does not help signal,Does not improve signal at all. Amazon promptly sent UPS to retrieve item and refunded my money. They are the best.
3,channelmaster 777,It didn't get me any more channels in my area as I have alot of trees but the picture quality did come in a little clearer. I would recommend this product.
1,Does not work,"I receive almost all the digital signals depending on the weather and the trees blocking signals from ABC and public TV. I am 30 miles southwest of Chicago. After installing Channelmaster 7777, I was not able to receive any stations from 2 through 7. I was able to get channel 9 and above. Channel 11 is WTTW public radio and the signal was sporadic. I am returning the Channelmaster 7777 and getting an antenna rated for 60 miles and above. These amplified devices have never worked for me."
1,preamplifer with power supply,We hired someone to install this for us and they never could get it to work. We got no stations with the preamplifier and without several. The part could have been defected we don't know for sure so it was returned.
3,Customer Support Problem,"This is a solid product, BUT.... the manufacturer, Crutchfield, is very stingy with support unless you buy directly from Crutchfield. I emailed a modest question about installation and they replied:""Product Support Advisors are reserved for Crutchfield Customers. Since you ordered the item from Amazon I am not sure if it came from us or not.""Really lame. But a great product and were it not for the attitude, I'd give it five stars."
5,Worked great!,It worked great...antenna is only 10 feet off the ground. 34 miles from the tower. Using the CM7777 Amp is a must if you want more than 10 channels... I got 40 once I hooked up the CM7777.
4,easy install and works,"Installed DB8 SW Florida - 65 miles from transmitters in Ft Myers. I have installed in 2nd home where I am using only part time. received so-so signals on 12 stations, 15 at night. during day and in windy conditions, experienced pixels and drop off. I research Amazon for pre amp. CM7777 had strong db increase with very little signal noise...most desireable! I ordered 2 day air and arrived next day - cool! install was a snap. came with one cable from power supply to spliter/injector. I now have 18 stations rock steady. HD is much more vivid than cable or sat tv. This give me TV at a most reasonable price. Thanks again Amazon."
3,Product Change - 2 input model no longer made,"I received my 7777 and it only has one antenna input, not two as pictured. I bought the amp to connect two antennas, one now, and one in the future(someday). But it only has one input. The other issue is the power supply was DOA. I had an old power supply and I'm using that while I work with Channel Master to replace the dead PS. A CM tech contacted me the day after I emailed him and we're working it out. UPDATE 4/4/12. CM tech confirmed that Channel Master no longer makes the two input version of the 7777. I ordered a new 7777 and swapped power supplies and shipped the defective unit back to the supplier. It's all working, but in the end, not the product I expected."
3,When it works it's great.,"We had our first Channel Master for 15 years and it worked great until it wore out. The next one we had for little over a year when it got hit by lightning. This last one was working great for a little under a month and then one day by that evening it just stopped working. When they are working they bring in a great picture and a strong signal. When they are not, the picture is grainy and the signal in weak to nonexsitent. We went from 20 channels to 3.(some of you are laughing but do you really need more?) There is no other way to test them other than to hook it up and test it out, but the picture is worth the risk."
3,I have TV.,My old TV booster ceased to function so I was looking for another. I bought and returned two before getting the Channel Master. I do not get as many stations as I got with the old one but I have TV.
2,This item is not working for me!,"I bought this product to replace an older model which was only delivering one TV station. But having installed this product I am receiving no stations. Perhaps I am doing something wrong in the installation, but so far I have been unable to get it working. Any suggestions would be appreciated.Thanks, JohnEins"
3,y,i am not very happy with this purchase. it did not work don't know if it is faulty or too powerful for my system. shipping was fast and reasonable.
3,good well it works,Put this unit up. worked great.Pulled in all the expected channels and a few extras. Too bad this unit stopped working after only 3 months.
1,CHECK YOURS ASAP - MINE WAS DOA - MADE IN CHINA,"I bought this CM 7777 amp about 4 months ago & just now have found time to mount it. It replaces a lower gain CM 7778. The CM 7777 was dead out of the box. Be aware that Channel Master gives only a 90 day warranty, so I missed out by a month. So I am SOL. Their tech support was useless - basically sorry about that, tough luck. Can't say a lot about the apparent Quality Control & Testing but what do you expect from China? If you buy one test it out ASAP. Also I would strongly suggest sealing the Type F connections with ""liquid electrical tape"" and the case with silicone rubber sealant - it is not sealed in any way - it does not have a gasket."
4,A wonderful discovery,"The arrangements are full of soul and skill, the harmonies outstanding, and the tone worshipful and full of hope. This early John Michael Talbot album has been difficult to find in electronic format. It's a delightful discovery."
4,Curious About This One,"I read it and I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a refreshing read. The author started the book off in a way I expected him to. Then he took it in another direction, to keep control of the grandness of the invasion, and I thought that direction was very clever, indeed."
1,Awful!,"Archer makes Stephen King read like Joseph Conrad. There is virtually little plot, character development or suspense and lacking a central hero to root for. I know these things are supposed to be fun and I enjoy violence when it can be fun but I have to draw the line when it comes to the senseless killing of children."
4,Very fun to read at night when home alone.,I just finished reading Mars Attaks: Martian Deathtrap and I belive that it is a very good book if you are into science fiction. It was really a great book.
4,Best documented book,"As a professor, I do think that this book has brought essential knowledge to the student community. But as a novelist, I am afraid thatwe are missing the intrigue, until we finally understand the real plot at the endof the novel."
2,"Boring, Dull & Repetitive","Blue gender doesn't have any real energy that the other Anime series give you. To much attempt at Drama with no comedy for the entire series. Plot isn't explained thoroughly. And the action scenes, when they happen are recut, rerun snippets over & over again. Snore Fest."
3,Worth a look for any medievalist,"This book manages to be of interest to anyone who wishes a travelogue of medieval pilgrimages, a humble recognition that even the oddest among us can have their minds very occupied with the divine, a look at the first autobiography of an English woman, or a case study in obsessive compulsive behaviour. Margery's disjointed recollections, coupled with her constant references to her revelations and retroactive ""virginity,"" admittedly are not a fun pursuit, but her extreme case does seem to place much of the deficiencies inherited from the worst in medieval spirituality (a legacy of the Plague ... even if the best of the era was the finest in history) into perspective. I guarantee that, while one may find Margery as troublesome as did those of her time and place, one will never find her recollections dull."
4,The recipe for rage.,"This was the second Type O album I bought, the first being ""Origin.."". I found it to be in keeping with the heavy duty rock riffs contained on ""Origin"". I like some of the versions of songs that appear on ""Origin"" better than the originals found here, but it is good to hear them in their virgin form. ""Gravitational Constant"" is just about as heavy as rock can get and still sound really good, with an incredible chanting ending that rides the album out perfectly. No other band would be able to pull off an anthem about hate (Der Untermensch) and do it with the flair that Type O has. ""Glass walls of limbo"" is absolutely spellbinding, filled with visial imagery. I call this album perfect listening if you are mad at someone.....or want to be. Stay Negative."
5,"an absolute must for the deranged,morbidly depressed,violent,cheated and just angry!!!!!!!!","as far as i care this is the only type O neg. cd ever,pete steel come accross as an even more violent and deranged jim morrison(lyrically poetic)amazing lines mixed with the bi polar music soundtracks of somber tone then brutally violent bursts of aggression.word can do this cd justice but if you like type O neg.and never heard this forgetaboutit you hate this cd because this is more like carnivore but years advanced musically.but don't forget about the origin of feces live these two cds need to be re mastered and double disc formate.these are no love songs goth style this is pure adulterated morbid hate."
3,"Good, but not as powerful as their later stuff.","I was first introduced to Type O Negitive with World Coming Down. I later bought bloody kisses, and october rust. There were all great. This wasn't as serious and it didn't have the same style as there later stuff."
2,"Sorry, but....","I suppose a lot of people like this cd, but not me. First of all I'm not a fan of hardcoure speedmetal. I was first introduced to Type O Negative with the cds ""Bloody Kisses"", and ""October Rust"". I prefer the melodic, moody, atmospherical, hardrock of this two cds over the harsh speedmetal of this cd. This one is unlistenable at times. I don't see how people like this! There is only one more cd that I sort of like and that is ""World Coming Down"". Is hard and melodic. There is actually singing and not screaming like ""Slow, Deep, and Hard"" I gave this cd 2 stars only because the song ""Hey Pete"" is a parody of Hendrix's ""Hey Joe"", and i though it was great, even comical!"
5,Works as advertised,Not sure what to say about this other than it's been very handy and it works as you'd expect. Has been very useful for all the projects I bought it to use for.
3,Good Enough,I bought this card to replace my old wireless adapter card because I needed something that would work under WPA2 security. The card does work OK except for one quirk. On boot up and every time the card is activated a dialog box comes up which says that Wireless Manager has discovered an error and has to close. It gives the option of sending a message to Microsoft or not. I'm calling this a quirk because the wireless signal does not get dropped. It's just a bit of a nuisance clicking off that dialog box every time the adapter card is activated. I am guessing that it has something to do with my computer because other reviews don't mention this problem.
4,Interesting Collection of Essays,Very thought inspiring collection of essays that address the social and economic implications of technology. Not very light reading and not very heavy - somewhere in between. May help to have some very elementary economics background. Worth reading if you're interested in understanding what technology may do to capitalism and the workforce.
2,measure twice cut once,"Not what I was looking for, I should have measured my space better. It is much shorter than I expected out of the product. Overall, however, the product itself if fine, though not as sturdy as some others I've come across."
1,"A review of the vendor, not the item","Customers should be aware that the vendors inflate the weight of this item by 19 pounds to increase their shipping ""costs"". Compare it with the other vendors on amazon that sell the same item, and with off-Amazon vendors. It's improper to do this."
3,Little known slasher flick from mid-80s isn't too bad...,"Job Bob Briggs is included on this DVD with an intro and commentary track. He's a big fan of this movie apparantly.The film is a departure from your run-of-the-mill 80s slasher flick but essentially follows the conventions of the genre with a few novel twists.It's a low budget offering with some inventive kill sequences (I particularly enjoyed the prologue) but the acting and directing are somewhat uneven.The outright sadism of the kids is hard to take at times. Just why are they so mean spirited towards their teacher? There doesn't seem to be any justification for the malevolence directed at her. It reminded me a little of ""Demented"". (I'm sure there's hardly anyone who has seen that sick little movie)You'll enjoy the movie a lot more with the Joe Bob Briggs commentary track turned on.For completist fans of 80s slasher flicks only."
2,Hell High or just Hell!!!!,"Overall the picture quality is superb compared to that of the vhs transfer. I did notice, however, that there are a few scenes edited out for the dvd version. There is a scene in the vhs where John John goes to steal a football jacket from a classmate and a few scenes with Dickens and Queenie discussing what they have done. It's at least five minutes edited out. During the scene where the teacher is laying on the ground you notice a slight pause then it cuts to Dickens eating a hot dog but there is no time gap so the dvd doesn't skip scenes but in fact that material was edited. Overall the movie is worth having on dvd but if you are fortunate to have the vhs-keep it!"
1,Nothing to see here,"This film suppose to show how hard it is to immigrate, and live in the united states as an immigrant with limited to no english proficiency.. but its a bunch of boringness.. i suggest you do not buy this movie its a sleeper"
2,Formulaic,"Like Endgame and Enigma, this is the story of a team of covert operatives on a secret mission for the government. The book closely parallels the first two in the series and, once again, the romance and action are too similar to make any of the books notable. Endgame, Enigma, and Exposure could easily be the same book - just insert the new characters; that is how formulaic and boring the series is. I wasn't captured at all by this book and will cross Dee Davis off my list for good."
3,The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church: And the Causes That Hinder It,"This is a book on how the organized church tends to discourage people who are excited about God and telling others. The organized church then either pushes them out of the way so the professional people can do the job: or they tend to make the person go thru all of their years of training and by then there is not much excitement left. So if you are excited, don't let them steal what God gave you and keep talking sharing and be excited! Of course you do need to learn more and be open, just be careful not to be quenched!"
2,"Interesting story, poorly written","While the story in this book is compelling and an interesting read, it's carelessly written. It is fraught with misspellings, typographical errors, poor grammar, redundancies, and simply non-existent editing. Running this manuscript through basic spell-check and grammar-check would have flagged 90% of the problems. This carelessness drove me crazy, to the point of red-penning the book! ""Sorrow of Heart..."" was co-written too, supposedly by an experienced author."
2,Not in the condtion advertised,I purchase many books & DVD's from Amazon sellers. The majority of the time what arrives is in the condition that was advertised. Most sellers want to help. This seller offered to refund the purchase. The book backing was broken & the cover was not attached. We opted to keep the book & try to repair the damage. Buyers need to read all the details listed about the product they are interested in purchasing and ask seller questions before making a purchase. I was disappointed in this order.
2,Not as good as some.,"Although normally I thrive on Bill Myers books this one didn't hold the same interest as the others usually do. It was an interesting plot but the ending wasn't quite right. Although as a Christian, I support the belief that prayer and faith can get you through anything, the story simply didn't appeal to me."
3,"Basic Plot, Good Character Development","The Forbidden Doors series has been one I normally enjoy. However, it usually incorporates things a little more realistic than fighting off vampires in Transylvania. This book is very basic as vampire stories go. There's no intense suspense or drama, except for very near the end. It's on an easy reading level, but I doubt it would appeal to the 9-12 age range.I disagree with many parts of Bill Meyers's work. His constant stressing that only Christians can be trusted becomes radical. Christians are never bad guys in his books, and I dislike the prejudice.It's worth checking out, but I'd recommend Buffy the Vampire Slayer or the Fearless series over Forbidden Doors."
5,Essential!,"I can't think of what else to say, some of the reviews on here really nailed it on the head. Suffice to say if you consider yourself a death metal fan and don't have this album, get real! I believe this was at the time the best selling death metal album ever, not sure if another has surpassed it since. Also the album cover is awesome and looks about like a Missouri/Kansas sky when a tornado is coming."
3,pretty good album,"I didn't think that this was as good as ""Cause of Death"" and I will swear all day long that this isn't as good as ""World Demise."" Having said that, a mediocre Obituary album is still better than most other bands work. There is some killer guitar riffs here, and John Tardys vocals just kill.The big problem to me is the production. Everything sounds very muddy. Listen to ""World Demise"" and then listen to this immediately afterwords. This just sounds too muffled, and not as intense. If it had a better production, I would like it a lot better.If you are new to Obituary, then this isn't the album to get. Get ""World Demise."" This is pretty good and has it's merits, but isn't their best work."
4,My Favorite,I love this salad dressing! I can't eat salad without it. It is very unique. If you like Italian dressing with a soy base you will love this. Amazon is the only place I can currently buy it. Love It!!!!!!!
1,Expiration Date Just Ten Days After Date of Receipt,"I received the item (it's not a refrigerated item) on 2.12.13. The label says that it should be used by the expiration date. Guess what the expiration date was? 2.22.13! Normally grocery items can't be returned. I'm working with Amazon customer service and the Seller (which primarily seems to be selling mints and candies). Grocery items normally cannot be returned. But even if I get a full refund, you can imagine that this is a hassle. This seller clearly does not have quality control. I'll update my review with my experience, but I'm pretty disappointed."
1,Please....,"Do people really buy this, or does the band pay them to buy it? I've never heard such stuid, boring, unmemorable music! This band is beyond horrible. Is their music fast?...yeah. Is it good...no! I highly recommend this to anyone that is a big fan of rotten music. Go buy a cd from a band that can actually play! Save your money; you'll be glad you did."
2,If you like DEATH METAL then . . .,"buy this piece of crap. This album is almost the same as the debut (Self titled). About half of these songs are unlistenable garbage; some of them have really cool riffs. The lyrics are unintelligable without the aid of the little booklet, but they do sound cool as sound effects rather than actual words. The content of the lyrics is worthless as they all salute death, satan, Charles Manson, and other awful things. These are just to shock and cause controversy and media attention. DEAD BY DAWN is the only musical gem in here with really cool sounding lyrics and heavy music but with no intelligence at all. Anyone who takes this kind of stuff as serious music is just as much of a poseur as anyone who likes the Backstreet Boys; just with different tastes in sound effects."
1,THIS IS THE WORST CD EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,A GREAT CD FOR FANS OF TERRIBLE MUSIC ! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
4,"A feast for the heart, soul and mind.","I have loved almost anything Asian most of my life. May be this is why I have not only been a life-time student of several martial arts, but also of Asian philosophy, art and poetry. One of my favorite books of poetry has been this collection. Unlike much of western poetry, which sometimes rambles on and on with no purpose, most of the Japanese and Asian approach to poetry is to have you experience a slice of life in a short sentence. The beauty of this book is that the author has each selection written in English, Japanese and in Kanji characters. Over the years, I have read this volume numerous times and it is always a joy. In conclusion, this is a book for anyone who is interested in Japanese poetry.Rating 4 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Haiku Moments: How to read, write and enjoy Haiku)"
5,A favorite,"If we could only get Amazon to delete the ""reviews"" here from jokers making lewd remarks about the bottle shape, I'd be more comfortable buying it here."
5,liquid gold,"Our kids call this dressing ""liquid gold"" because it is so good AND expensive. We always buy it through amazon as it is difficult to find in stores. Our kids eat it on iceberg lettuce, rice, grilled meat. When we were in the military overseas, the company even shipped it to us free to thank us for our service!"
1,So bad it induced labor.,"The only good thing about this movie was my wife going into labor 2 hours later. We must have fast forwarded 1/2 the movie, and it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. My wife enjoyed labor more than I enjoyed enduring the movie. Be careful if it's not close to your due date . . ."
3,Pretty good material.,"I find this solo album from Gene Simmons to be pretty good. All eleven of the tracks are listenable and satisfying. Most of the material is in a straight-ahead rock direction. The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are good and solid. Female background vocals are used quite frequently throughout the album, too. A choir is utilized on a couple of tracks (""True Confessions"" and ""Always near You""). There is also some orchestration on some of the tracks. Gene Simmons does an energetic and enjoyable job with the vocal duties. My favorite songs are ""Mr. Make Believe"" and ""When You Wish upon a Star."" ""Mr. Make Believe"" sports nice background vocals, while ""When You Wish upon a Star"" benefits from the beautiful orchestration and background vocals. This is a pretty cool solo album from Gene Simmons. It's good from start to finish and is worth a listen."
4,This album rocks and shivers !,It's my second Kiss solo-album favourite ! Gene's album is almost as good as the Ace Frehley one. Don't hestitate to buy them both ! You'll keep playing them over and over - and : Hurry - these are limited editions !!!
1,Gene Simmons - self-titled (Mercury),"Are they kidding with this release? This is the 1978 solo record by the blood-spitting Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. Paul Stanley's solo lp is much better (see my review). I couldn't honestly see too many fans actually buying this CD reissue EXCEPT for maybe bored (yawn!) completists. I don't like to whine that much, but this disc was sort of tough for me to sit all the way through. There are a few so-so cuts, like ""Burning Up With Fever"", ""See You Tonite"" and possibly ""Mr.Make Believe"". But the album's closer ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" almost made my dinner come up. Simply avoid at ALL costs."
3,Not what I expected but not horrible either,At the time this came out I liked it ok. As the years went by I grew to hate it. But now I've come full circle. For what the band was going through it really wasn't that bad of an effort from Gene. He stays true to his beliefs and gives us a decent set of songs.
3,1978 the solos,"Gene's is the most experimental of all 4,but that is good. I enjoy listening to this record more than Destroyer even. Very Beatleseque. Like See you tonite, Mr. Make Believe,and Nowhere To Hide. Personally fave Radioactive."
4,Severly underrated,"Unlike Ace and Paul, Gene and Peter seemed to truly understand the idea behind the 'solo' albums. It was to let them each create without having the others critique, something that would never happen on a Kiss record. The 1,000,000 copy release of each of the four albums almost bankrupt the band and Casablanca Records, with Ace scoring the only hit, but the songs on Gene's and especially Peter's albums showed something that at that time was far removed from the standard Kiss rock tunes."
3,Gene shoulda borrowed Aces Guitar.,"Radioactive kicks off the album. It features a very nice orchestral opening, and then it becomes an excellent blues rock song. Gene couldn't have started the album off better. We get more blues-based rock in Burning Up With Fever and True Confessions which are a bit dull.I like Mr.Make believe,which is a cool tune.See You In Your Dreams is a poor attempt to better a version on Rock And Roll Over,this version stinks.The album closes with When You Wish Upon A Star, which is a cover of the song popularized by the Disney corporation. Why on Earth he did that song has got me buggered,while he did his best to get real emotion in that song,this album never hit the spot like it should have."
5,Gene Simmons: KISS Solo Album,"Even though a lot of the songs on the record weren't what you would call KISS worthy songs, Gene did a good job putting this together. I was impressed by the quality work and the effort he put into this album."
2,What the heck?,"You would expect the demon of kiss to have a heavy enerjetic solo album but its the exact opposite. I think there are 2 good songs on it. I believe we actually have Cher to blame for this because she was dating Gene at the time and probably influenced him. There is a good version of ""See you in your dreams tonight"" which was on the kiss album Rock and roll over. Do your self a favor and don't buy this unless you are a kiss obsessor (like myself)."
3,THE DEMON,"Peter's solo album was eclectic, with Gene's solo album it just seems a bit unfocused. Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with experimentation (I guess thats what the solo albums were for), but at the end of the day many of these songs either try to be too clever, or too obscure..and that ends up being the albums down fall. We cover all kinds of musical ground here from Beatlesque stylings ""Mr Make Believe"" and ""See You Tonite"" to great pop metal with ""Radioactive"" and ""Livin In Sin"", to the outrageous and awful ""When You Wish Upon A Star"". Again I'd say they are all great songs (with the exception of the last) but it just makes it a little too hard for the listener to take this in as an all round listening experience. Taken apart from the others many of these songs work real well. Perhaps if we were to place a Paul song every second song, it would work real well! Wink Wink! Oh hang on that's called a Kiss album...go figure!"
2,Gene's Ego Running Wild,Unfortunately this was done in 1978 when nearly all music was horrid. Radioactive is fun and some of the stuff is ok. I was on the floor laughing the first time I heard the lyrics 'I'm living in sin at the Holiday Inn' because it was so stupid. The music on the song was good though. Hearing Gene sing 'when you wish upon a star' is very painful. Overall this album is just too slow - call me a purist but one slow Kiss song a record is plenty.
4,"God of Thunder, and Beatlesque Tunes","I think there's enough cool songs on here to outweigh the wacky ones. One thing I'll never figure out is why all 4 members decided to have female background singers on their records. More groupies I guess? Anyways, ""Radioactive"" is a cool Gene tune and sounded great live on the Dynasty Tour. ""See You Tonite"" is Gene doing a great Beatles interp., but I like it. I also like ""Man of 1000 Faces"" and ""Mr. Make Believe."" Gene gets silly with ""Living in Sin"" and ""Tunnel of Love"" and ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" But having the Kiss guys branch out and do different things is what makes these solos cool and unique. At this point, they had to write some different stuff."
2,An Okay Album,"Of all the Kiss solo albums, Gene Simmon's release would have to be the most experimental. Almost all of it isn't my taste, but it's not completely bad though. ""Mr. Makebelieve"" would have to be the best track on here. ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" is also surprisingly good. As far as I remember, when I first heard that song I was quite baffled. But it's not bad. I actually give this album 2.5 stars. I think this could have been a better album--heavier."
1,Cheap Joke,"Gene Simmons never stopped criticizing the solo-effort of his collegue Peter Criss. But where Criss really tried to make a 'solo' album, not a great one but a good one, Simmons never came any further than hiring a couple of famous names, without even considering taking time to write a decent tune. This resulted in one of the worst Kiss albums ever. It contains a couple of decent songs, but most of the songs are rock-musical based tunes that are just not good enough. Wanna buy one of the solo-albums? Don't go for this one..."
4,the demon shines but........,"gene simmons solo effort is just as you'dexpect. very strange, mysterious and showbizzy but has some great songs. Radioactiveand Tunnel of Love could've been on anyKISS album while the rest might have madeDynasty or Unmasked. It's good fun rocksongs with some ballads like 'see you tonite'which was redone for unplugged. Gene's talentis always good because he knows what the fansexpect from him and this is good fun."
2,When Gene Wished Upon A Star,Buy this one for the front cover art only. If you want to listen to good Gene Simmons songs listen to almost any regular Kiss album. These must be a collection of songs that were voted down by the band on previous albums.

1,A failure to understand...or was it psychopathology,"Baldino's book in a single writing appears to include evey misconception of the methadone patient that might be written. The book is more to the fear of the writer than would allow her to write an effective treatment of the patients she should have served. Stigma, fear and and a failaure to understand are the driving forces of this book. And, the patients are made to suffer still again because of it."
1,This Book is a Horrible Misrepresentation,"This book just goes to show that you do not have to know anything about Methadone Treatment to work in the field. The facts are in and this author has missed the boat. Hopefully, she will go into a proffession where she can do no more harm. Methadone saves lives and patients see their lives improve dramatically. I am truly surprised that this book was published at all, however since it was it should definitely be listed under the Fiction category. This book gets a big fat zero for its rating."
2,Beware! Does not fit every rubbermaid,"This trash can lid is described as fitting any 32GAL Trash can, that is not the case, it did not fit our regular 32GAL Rubbermaid. We decided to keep them as it covers and fastens under the handle, however it is too large for it.Update:The description for this lid has been altered, when I purchased it, the details and description stated the lid would fit any Rubbermaid trashcan 32Gal. Since that is what it claimed I purchased it only to find out it did not fit my Rubbermaid. I do not own the Roughneck Trashcan and so cannot review the product as it is described to be used now. I am keeping my 2 star review because I am still stuck with wrong lid for my Rubbermaid thanks to the description this product had when I purchased it."
3,Trash can lids,"They are adequate replacement lids but do not fit as well as originals, the locking mechanism on trash can is incompatible with replacement lid."
2,Wrong size,Wasn't accurate with the size of our garbage cans and the lids are too big. Problem is that it is too expensive to send back for refund and I can't find anyone who has these giant size garbage cans. Thinking about putting them on Craig's List for FREE just to get rid of them. Will be much more careful in the future when I order on line!!!!
2,Way too big!,"Does NOT fit my 32 gallon rubbermaid can, returning it is too much of a hassle. Save your money!"
1,paying as much for lid as original can is out of the question,We use 4 square/oblong w/wheels for garden 'stuff'Dollar General $15 and $20 depending on sizeThen butt together fronts with handles to outside and secure lids across top w/each end of bungee cord looped into handle - $2.IF cracks in lids develop cover w/$1 shower curtain or vinyl picnic table cloth and bungee around. After 60 and 65MPH winds yesterday [2/25/11] - all still intact outside - and bins more colorful depending on what U cover them with.
5,Engaging from Beginning to End!,"Oh, what a different sort of guide to teaching playwriting! The author (and playwright and teacher) is clearly an expert at sharing the tools needed to write a stageworthy play. And she makes it fun, lots of fun. Like the best writers and teachers everywhere, Maureen Brady Johnson takes the everyday and makes it new -- whether it's a rock on a college campus where students paint (and repaint) messages, Halloween vampire teeth, or a shoe on the highway. Lessons are clearly described along with their objectives. Teachers and writers alike will soon find their copy of this book (like mine) dog-eared from use!"
3,"""One chip off from perfect""",Ordered for my wife and gave to her for our anniversary. She likes them but one diamond chip was missing. Amazon indicated you had no more available and offered a 'return'. Elected to keep and had a local jewler replace the chip. Similar earrings in local stores were three to ten times the price so I cannot complain. I think the 'fix' only cost about $20.
5,K&N Replacement Filter,Filter is as promised...great quality and a good price for a part that will last indefinitely. I like the idea of cleaning and re-using instead of buying and discarding an air filter for my vehicle. I have used K&N in the past and have never experienced any issues with the product.
5,Awesome Replacement Filter,This is a great replacement filter if you are in the market. I have already cleaned it one time and it is very easy to do so. I highly recommend buying this product because of the money savings factor.
5,Top Notch,"As usual, K&N filter works perfect, gives you that extra kick of power when needed and helps get better gas milage too."
1,wrong size,"i love these filters. i have one on all of my cars , and have had for soom time, however the filter shipped was not the right size"
5,Breath a bit easer with this filter,"Your engine will thank you for installing one of these. Mine has been installed now for 70K miles or more. I often am on dusty roads, and this filter has paid for itself over and over again. Every 4 to 6 months, I pulled it out, and rinse it off with plain hose water, and let dry overnight. Once a year I clean it, and then used the K&N oil maintenance kit. DO NOT OVER OIL this filter and you will have MANY MANY MANY years of use."
1,lets too much dirt in,"doesnt work well as a filter. thats why car makers dropped the idea of cotton gauze as a filter medium back in the 50s. the intake on my truck was filthy on the inside after just 25,000 miles."
5,Comfort and qualtiy,The slip-on shoes from Clarks are very comfortable and excellent quality for the price.
5,The Story of Creation with Colors! AWESOME!,"This book goes beyond creative learning with simplicity as the key. Each day of creation is associated with a color of the rainbow (""On the first day, God made the light - White!"") and as the babies get older, they associate the basic bible verses with that color, i.e., ""Blue - That's the day God made the great big sky, Dad!"" (That's from my four year old) Also, there is a mirror on the last page so when you read ""God Loves You"" to the baby, he/she is seeing themselves in the mirror and gets the concept right away. Awesome!The same thing happens with animal sounds in the God Made Animals Book. Amazingly cool!"
5,One of the best baby DVD's out there!,"As a first time babysitter of twins I really appreciate this DVD series. I bought ""God made Animals"" as well. Once the video comes on they stop what they are doing and are glued to the screen. They love the puppets, voices, and music. They prefer these videos to any of the other baby videos that they have. A truly wonderful biblically based video series that is educational and entertaining for little ones."
4,"Overall, a good book, but...","I read this book to my 5 and a half year old daughter, two chapters a night. We both enjoyed it very much. However, when I finally said ""The End"" to her, she looked at me like I was kidding. When I told her that it was truly finished, it left us both a little disturbed. We figured there had to be a sequel (there isn't). I'm sure White intended this type of ending to be symbolic or something, but for a young child, it doesn't make much sense. If the movie ends the same way, you can bet the test audiences were not happy."
1,bizarre! poor harriet! what a rude man-mouse!,"I've just read all 99 reviews and can't believe no one mentions how bizarrely Stuart treats Harriet Ames! He goes out of his way to invite her down to the river at sunset for a boat ride. He tells her he's well-proportioned and and also suggests she not tell her parents she's coming to meet him. weird. But stranger yet- she does come to meet him, and when Stuart discovers his canoe has been damaged, he speaks bitterly, sulks, screams, and acts like a rude jerk toward his guest. When she keeps trying to encourage him to make the best of it, he acts selfish, spoiled, and abusive. He refuses a peppermint she offers him. She invites him to come with her to dinner and out dancing and he says no I have to leave early in the morning. Finally she leaves. Is this book a primer for children to explain how men treat women badly? How bizarre!!!"
5,Classic story of International Interest,"My 8 year old Grand daughter in Italy was thrilled to get this fine edition, with E.B.White and original drawings."
2,Okay for grownups - not great for kids,"I read this book to my five-year-old. I was expecting a wonderful adventure story and was disappointed - so was he. It started out fine - with descriptions of Stuart's family situation and the struggles he had with being ""like a mouse."" But the story quickly went south as Stuart went north to look for his bird friend. He simply leaves his family and doesn't seem to miss them because he is so obsessed with this bird. Some of the situations were funny to me as an adult but were totally lost on my child. Therefore, I think this would be a good book for adults but not a good story for kids. We rented the movie this weekend and it was much better than the book (I don't think I've ever thought that before!)"
3,Cute but strange ending,"This was a cute book about litle Stuart the mouse in NYC. I listened to it in my car a week ago. Its a great book for kids, but I kept thinking how bizarre some of the events were. The voice of the cat in the book is agravating, like fingernails on a blackboard. The book kind of trails of in the end when Stuart starts looking for his lover, the little bird Margolo. Then it ends. Odd. But a great book to read to kids at bedtime. ."
3,"Good book, bad ending","I enjoyed this book, but I didn't really enjoy the ending. The beginning and middle were well written, the characters were well thought out. The boat race was probably the most exciting part. The ending was poorly written. However, EB White was suffering from hypochondria, and this is why he ended the book so abruptly and never wrote a sequel. He could have written one, but was suffering from this illness. I prefer the movie, very sadly, in this one instance."
1,Please watch the movie instead of reading the book.,"I have seen the movie Stuart Little way before I read the book. And the book was just not good.It begins when Stuart Little was born to Mr. & Mrs. Little. In the movie, Mr. & Mrs. Little take Stuart Little in to thier home (even though he was not born to them).One Day Mrs. Little loses her ring. And sends down Stuart to get it. She lost it in the drain of the bathtub. In the book, they like ping-pong. In the movie they never say that they like ping-pong.One Day, when Stuart was about 3 years old, Mrs. Little is not smart and though he was in the hole in the hose. When he really was in the shade.Even in the movie, Mrs. Little is not smart. Don't make me go that far. Later on in the book, a bird named Margalo shows up.The movie is mostly diffrent from the movie. Expect for there is the boat named the Wasp. But not owned by George Little."
2,Strange ...,"What a strange little book. Much is made of the fact that Stuart's parents - especially his mother - worries about him constantly, yet when he runs off to find his bird friend, he tells no one! And Stuart is obviously gay, not that there's anything wrong with that (I'm gay ... check out the illustration on page 31) He doesn't really want to date the girl, he's more interested in his canoe ..."
4,An Analysis of Stuart Little,I feel the book Stuart Little should be read in an elementary school classroom. Children love to read books about animals. The book Stuart Little tells the tell of a mouse and his many adventures. Stuart Little is also shown love which is important for children of all ages to feel as well read about. Personally I was read Stuart Little as a child and still remember his many adventures. I recomend this book for children I the 3rd or 4th grade although any age group in the elementary grade levels could apply. Children as well as adults fall in love with Stuart and wish to read more about his adventures.
2,"good start, amounts to nothing","This was the first chapter book I read alound to my three-and-a-half-year old. The situation and the language were very evocative for my boy, and he wanted to talk about it all day long. The boat race was especially inspired, fun to read aloud (although I didn't know half the jargon), and my son repeated the colorful seefaring phrases for days. However, I grew frustrated as the story grasps for bizarre plot arcs (I'm willing to accept a mouse that talks, but a 5-inch tall girl named Harriet Ames is just random).Because my son is adopted, I appreciated the ""different kinds of families"" theme at the beginning of the book. I don't want to spoil the story, but I felt the ending undermined this theme."
3,Stuart Little,"Stuart Little by E.B. White is a classic story.I never knew what was going to happen to this courageous little mouse.In the book it is like you are reading through the eyes of a mouse as you go through some of his adventures.This book follows the life of a city family called the Littles.They adopt a son and name him Stuart, but the catch is Stuart is a mouse! So why would you want to read a story about a mouse?You would want to read this book because it is packed with adventure! You never know what is going to happen next! The story goes from Stuart befriending a bird named Margolo, to sailing a sailboat,to trying to drive his own car!Oh, and did I mention the CATS? It was interesting to imagine in my mind what the world looked like through a mouse's eyes.Any person who likes adventure and little animals will love this book. It also doesn't take very long to read. I read it in two days because I liked it so much! I can't wait to read more of E.B. White's books and stories."
3,Missing Ending,"I like reading this book with my class. The story of a mouse born to a human family and the problems he faces is really fun. However, the ending is awful. It leaves the reader hanging, wondering what really happened. It's as if White had to hurry up and finish it without really deciding what happens to Stuart. We always write our own ending to the book."
4,Stuart Little,"This book is very interesting and fun to read. If you have to do a report for a book or what ever you should read Stuart Little. I rate this book 4 stars because it is fun but could do better. But it was good . People 8 and up should read this book, just to read a book. If you are looking for more good books you should read more of E.B Whites books they are interesting and fun to read and passes the time fast because you get into it so fast."
5,Children's literature but no lack of complexity,"I read Stuart Little when I was in second grade. I can honestly say that it is one of my absolute favorite books.Stuart is a mouse, but he's not some passive polite little creature. He is witty, intelligent beyond his years, and persistent in his goals. He has the mind of a philosopher; he is always cheerful even though it may not seem that way. He is wise but not self-righteous. Indeed, Stuart is a near-perfect role model. This book was one of the first one I ever read that really stuck in my mind; in my attempts to discover even more about Stuart and his goals, I took on his personality and set about solving my own philosophical ideas. It truly helped the development of my persona. A book that has such an effect on a person is nothing less than a true classic."
2,"Perhaps this would have been a ""masterpiece"" if...","The beginning was good, the middle was good, but the ending? Blah...And I quote "" He headed north, and somehow, he knew he was going in the right direction"" What kind of an ending is that, I ask? And of course, E.B. White didn't write a sequal, so you never know how the story ends! Skip this one and read ""Charlotte's Web""."
2,Not for anyone over Six,"I see the reading level as 9-12. Yikes! If Harry Potter is 9-12, then Little should be 1-3. I did love the beginning of this story. There is no explanation as to why a human mother presumably gives birth to a mouse instead of a human child. The story goes on without anymore reference to it. As if this is just the way it was. End of discussion. I loved that! Funny. And the writing is charming, to be sure, but the story just goes on without getting anywhere. It's one adventure after another without an end in sight. No goal. That's my trouble with Stuart Little.To explain the sudden and unsatisfying ending, I did hear that the author, White, was quite a hypochondriac. At the time of this book's writing, he was convinced he was going to die at any moment, (He ended up living a number of decades after Stuart Little was first published.) So, fearing certain death, White demanded the publisher to publish the book now!, as is, ""before I die tomorrow!"" Amazing, but true."
1,NEVER RECEIVED BOOK!,"I CANNOT TELL YOU IF I LIKED THE ITEM OR NOT BECAUSE I NEVER RECEIVED IT. BUT, WE HAVE READ THE BOOK AND MY 7-YEAR-OLD SON LOVES IT. GREAT ADVENTURE TALE."
3,Stuart Little,"This book was about a family with the last name Little. One day the parents go out to adopt a brother for their son. When they arrive, a mouse starts speaking to them. They are so confused thinking of what kid they can take home with them. The mouse starts speaking to them of how much he would love to have a family. He would have loved to have a family like them.So afterall they adopt him. when they take him home the real son of theirs does not believe them that the rat is their brother. He also gets very dissapointed. One of the mouse's fears was that, big mean white sharped nailed, cat Snowball. Many times Snowbell tried eating him. Later on in this story he and Snowbell make good friends. Snowbell starts protecting Stuart from all of the street cats. Stuart sleeps in a match box. It's very hard for him to get around the city because he is so small and anyone may step on him. There is a movie and a book mad of him. The both brothers are put on a soccer team."
3,Stuart Little,"Stuat Little the book is a little bit odd in a way. I say that because it is not that believable to me. It seems that the author I'll be nice and wont give out a name,but the author to me must not be concentrating enough when he/she writes. To me I can undestand what the author's thoughts of the story ar, but they don't seem to go together, come on now have you ever seen or heard of a mouse that wals and talks and who is adopted to human as a son come on now, and who is going on adventures in the sea. I have to be honest the movie was even better than this. Like I said I can undestand the point of view of the autho but this is sure not to be read by o middle school student. I know this is fiction book, but at least come up with a better topic. So this is just a measage from me don't buy this book it's just a waste of money as well as your time."
3,STUART LITTLE,Have you ever seen a big house and such a small mouse in the house? Well now you can just read stuart Little. I am going to tell you a little about stuart.He is a very small mouse that is a very small mouse that is on an adventure to the bird named Margalo. This book is like the movie in some parts and the other parts are different. I recomend this book to someone who likes adventure and excitement. Because they would really like it and get into it.
4,My First Long Book,"Stuart Little is a story about a mouse. He can do lots of things. I liked when he shot an arrow into Snowbell's ear. Snowbell the cat was trying to eat Margola, the bird. He can drive a car. He can paddle a canoe. I also liked the part when he gets trapped in the garbage can. He chops down a dandelion with his small ax. I would like to do that too. This is a good book for a second or third grader."
4,Stuart Little,"Stuart Little is brave, young mouse living with his human family. He runs away to find his good friend Margalo, the bird. Find out more about his adventures by reading this book."
2,Dull family classic,"The second son of the Little family turns out to be a mouse, whom they nevertheless name Stuart and raise as their own. I was somewhat underwhelmed by this family classic. Stuart's ""adventures,"" such as riding on a toy boat and going down a drain, are related briefly and dully, without developing much tension or excitement. The characters are unfailingly stiff and polite with each other; even the interaction between family members often comes off like conversations between strangers at a cocktail party. The Little family's treatment of Stuart seems quite neglectful as well. Mr. Little, in particular, seems to think nothing of sending his little son into potentially dangerous situations, such as down a drainpipe to fetch a ring. At one point, the book describes how it becomes Stuart's job to go inside the piano while it is being played and hold on to a key that sticks, even though doing so subjects him to loud noises that affect his hearing for hours afterward."
2,"Famous author, over rated book","The first half of the book is charming and enjoyable, but my family and I lost interest in the second half, which seemed to be ""fill"" to complete the work for publication. We found the book to be inconsistant in its style; Was STUART LITTLE meant to be complete fiction, with disappearing cars, other little people, and people who accepted Stuart's made up money, or a story about a small mouse-boy in an otherwise normal world? Save yourself some time, and skip STUART LITTLE. If you're interested in a story about little people, I'd recommend THE LITTLES by John Peterson ."
3,"Harriett knows best, but she gets insulted - and now I know why Margalo flew away","Lovely book, beautiful prose, interesting adventures of a mouse and his improbable family. Loved the bird Margalo -- innocence and adventure, a true free-spirit with the soul of a philosopher. Stuart's attitude directed toward Harriet (""I'm afraid a woman can't understand these things"") rates a Bronx cheer from me. Harriett had alot more sense than Stuart, and could have saved the day, but his attitude and ignorance ruined it all. When I was a kid I tossed books like that, and this one gets tossed too."
4,We loved it,The price matches the quality. A very good novel that entertains children as well as parents.
3,Ordered by mistake but daughter likes them,"My daughter's crocs size 9-10 are too small. I ordered the next size which is unfortunatley 11-12. I wish they made a 10-11 size as the 11-12 in the mary jane style is WAY too big. She can't wear them yet, but decided to keep them and wait for her to grow into them instead of paying the return shipping charge. For a todder/ little kid, I prefer the cayman style - just an easier fit."
4,great little kid shoe,"This are great summer shoes. I got them for my 1 yr old little girl and they are perfect for when she is playing outside and gets sand or water on her feet. They are easy to clean and very cute on her. The only drawbacks are that they don't have much support for her feet like a sneaker or ""real"" shoe and the plastic makes her feet a little sweaty. Of course all the gibbets make them fun too:)"
4,Good product,"It's perfect for my two and half year old daughter. Comfortable, durable and easy to clean. The only concern I have is that she may twist her ankle in these shoes, but it hasn't happened yet."
5,Please see previous review,"As I have already stated I will not waste my time on these reviews and will only fill in ""stars"""
4,a good book with a broad coverage in the image processing,"This book helped me gain the basic knowledge in digital image processing. Although it doesn't have any sample programming code, the description and the math functions in the book are good enough for me to understand the different imaging processing techniques and finish my image processing programming projects at work."
5,MAGIC,"Someone gave me this book, I don't know who. I think it was a gift from the newspaper,... Anyway it was fantastic. Rading this book was like having the need of knowing more and more about it. On the one had I wanted to end reading it but on the other hand I had a sad feeling of doing it. I had ever heard nothing about Paul Auster, but since then I started reading any thing I found about him. He is an artist. I think that there is not much people able to write as he does it. His descriptions are exelent, and all the people he introduces you seem to be real and near to you. First of all I tried to tell my friends to read it , but his name seemed strange to them and didn't trust on me. But now I feel I am not the only one."
5,Riveting and intriguing character study,"I began reading Leviathan with no knowledge of Auster other than that a friend enjoyed his work. The book read quicker and more easily than I expected, but it is by no means shallow or simple. Having now read several other Auster novels(Music of Chance, Moon Palace), I can't helping believing that much of the book, at least in terms of character study, is autobiographical. The plot does require a certain suspension of disbelief, but this does not diminish its artistic merit."
5,One of the best books of the century,Not much more can be said about this incredible book. Paul Auster is a real master. A writer that capture you with his writing and don't let you stop reading and for me Leviathan is his masterpiece.
5,A Collapse into Estrangement,"This novel is troubling. A man the reader gains great respect for hides from society and we are left to fill in the blanks. Why did he leave a wife of beauty and intellect? Why did he leave a friend remarkably loyal? To answer that question, Auster has us look at the world, that is to say, America. In a brilliant mixture of mystery and drama Auster tells a story of America not unlike a Vonnegut or Alex Ross critique."
5,excellent!,"i am slowly becoming obsessed with paul auster! he is a brilliant writer who sneaks into your mind and does a little jig!after reading 'new york trilogy' i had to read 'leviathan'-- now i can't wait to start 'double game' by sophie calle, an art-piece about the novel 'leviathan'.auster rocks!i obviously recommend this novel!"
3,Disappointed,I expected something much weightier than what I found in reading this book. The storyline was slow and mildly interesting.
4,"crafty, but flawed by the writer's philosophizing conceits","The book is meticulously written and structured with knowing complexity. What usually hurts Auster's books are his overreliance on the philosophical issues to propel the narrative or define the characters' motivation or psychology. The books simply become illustrations of the ideas rather than ideas revealing themselves out of the writings. Nevertheless, Auster is powerful when indicating small metaphysical details that everyday existence represses, and elegance of his prose is perhaps only matched by DeLillo among Americans. One other point: Auster has not thoght through the textual implications that first person narratives present. At the end of the book, there is a passage indicating that the narrator gave the very text that he wrote to the FBI agents. How could he have written about the act itself given that we should believe the verity of this writing as a confession?"
2,Mildly interesting - too slow.,After reading the reviews I figured this book must be a great work of literature. I didn't even get interested in the story until halfway through and even then I was only mildly interested. The pace was too slow and way too may digressions. I just kept wondering 'when is this book going to get good?'.
5,Fiction at its best,"LEVIATHON by Paul Auster is, in my opinion, one of the best examples of American fiction we have. Auster takes elements from his own life and weaves them together with flights of the imagination. Auster is one of the few writers out there who consitently produces work that is entertaining and remarkable at the same time. Too many authors devote their talents to being ""clever"" or ""difficult"" these days. Auster, while at times experimental, never loses sight of what should be, what absolutely must be, every fiction writer's goal: To tell a story."
5,Leviathan has human touch,"Leviathan is a great book, Auster's most emotionally moving novel to date. Also less experimental than NY trilogy, but that's okay; Auster has shown that he can excel with experimental narratives as well as traditional stories (he wrote the script for the film Smoke). Do the characters represent real-life people? Well, the narrator's initials are P.A., just like Paul Auster. There are a couple of facts that link Benjamin Sachs with Don Delillo. Delillo, like the Sachs character, wrote a political novel--Libra. He was also in negotiations to turn it into a movie, but a film version was never made--just as Sachs' novel was never filmed. Interestin', eh?"
3,"its..OK, not a whole much more","dont know why, but i guess i dont like Paul too much, and i wanted to read one more book before i finally say that his not for me (after reading ""vertigo"" and one other, in hebrew) ive decided to read this one in english.... to say that its more than OK i cant... so, thats that."
2,Astoundingly banal.,"Briefly: ""Leviathan"" suffers, tragically, from a deep lack humanity and Auster's kitsch ""book within a book"" gimmick employment. Folks, this is a rewrite of the far superior ""The Locked Room"". Still, it almost makes it; had the development of Sach's and the narrator's relationship been more deeply considered this may have been quite good. At each point in the novel we are given a situation that brings us almost, not quite, a little bit further... to the development of any sort of dynamic between the characters. Relationships go from white to black with the drop of a hat. Somewhat contradicting myself, Auster could have successfully dropped all relationships in the novel for a development of a philosophical theme."
2,"Started great, went sour","This author has a lot of talent, but it really lost it the minute the scene in VT occurred. I think he just ran out of interest decided to make it sensational to sell it, and went back and stuck some motifs in the beginning to make it 'look' like a coherent book. The last 50 or so pages were really bad.All the same the guy is a very gooooood writer at his best. Almost reminds me of a cross between Summons to Memphis and LA Confidential. The writing from the narrator's point of view was stunning at the beginning. There were just too many coincidences in this book that to me would have been better off as mysteries and ambiguities."
3,no masterpiece but not good enough,"This is not a book I would rave about, but having read it, I would call it descent. The characters are well thought off, they are unique and personal.The book if too full of its message, though. It tries too hard to mask itself as one of those books that make the reader think about the meaning of things. The author desperately wants the reader to question his work, to scrutinize it for symbolism and hidden meanings. Problem is that its way to obvious and much too direct. The book lays claims to a realm of higher meaning which it is not written nearly well enough to reach.However, taken at face value, it is a pretty enjoyable read."

The good vocals and catchy lyrics can still set the dancefloor on fire. The production is on point. This is recommended to those who enjoy sexy, danceable songs that are not too intelligent for its own good, yet not banal either. Just good dance club music."
5,Wow!! Amazingly uplifting!,"This production captures the entire soul. It reaches deep inside and pulls from you heartfelt feelings of both compassion and gratitude. You cannot help but feel compassion for all who struggle in this world because of undeserved hardships due to nature or nurture and for all who suffer at the hands of those who strive to oppress not only the body, but the spirit as well. You feel a sense of gratitude for personal blessings and for the heroes and heroines of life who, like Rudy, emerge from their hardships and trials as butterflies from their cocoons. Their beauty inspires, brings renewed hope, and fosters courage........they truly teach us that we too can fly. Thank you for taking the time to share this sweet and profound message with the world. May it's message open our eyes and hearts, enabling us to see more and do more and be more. And, to love more."
3,Waiting for the whole movie,"So far the movie is an interesting premise, but this DVD was only a few minutes of what they say will soon be a full length film."
5,Philosophy,"I got the books sooner than I thought. They were in perfect condition, never used. I will get a lot of use out of these books."
4,A Good Buy and a Solid Translation,"This in my opinion is the finest one volume collection of the works of Aristotle. I cannot offer anything novel in my review; other reviewers furnished numerous pertinent instructive descriptions. Having the material in one volume is very helpful and I too think the Oxford work isn't as rigid. I recommend it to anyone who desires the meat of Aristotle's work in a format that is inexpensive and convenient. Textual criticism may not allow one to know which texts are genuine among the extant material, but what we do have of assumed Aristotelian thought is utterly important and stunningly relevant in today's philosophical discussions.All philosophers, epistemologists, and apologists should own this compilation and contrast it to the Oxford edition."
5,One of my favorites,"No, it doesn't have the great introductions you will get in the individual copies of the texts; it has very simple, nice outlines of each section at the beginning of each book though. The fact that this book is massive (around 1600 pages) and contains the complete editions of his most famous works - Metaphysics, Ethics, and Politics - and is less than twenty bucks makes it a steal. It's easily one of my favorites of all time."
4,The Truth Hurts,"After centuries of persecution and anti-semetic feelings towards the Jewish people, the truth is clear, The Church (our) hands are stained with blood. I read this book almost a year ago and the message still touches my heart. If you want to know the extent at which you have been effected by anti-semetic feelings towards the Jewish people, read this book. Dr. Brown, a Messianic Jew, is a scholar and does a very complete job of handling the anti-semetic attitudes of past Church leaders who are highly recognized and respected. This book is very helpful in it's history and in it's tenderness and forgiveness offered to the Church for her persecution of the Jews. Dr. Brown also very scholarly answers the assumptions and speculations that Church has replaced the Jewish people as God's chosen people. No, God will save the Jewish people. The veil will be removed and they will see their Messiah and turn to him with all their hearts. And the Church and Israel will kiss. Glory!"
2,Not what I was looking for,"I read this book wanting to comprehend how anti-Semitism first originated, flourished, and then culminated in the Holocaust with Christianity as part and parcel of the whole process. Instead, I got countless examples of this ancient hatred and how it manifested itself in the past and present time. I guess this approach was fine for someone who needed to be convinced of the existence of anti-Semitism. But, this approach didn't really help me to better understand the cause and reason behind the subject matter."
3,The Boer War: Origins and Consequences,"This book does a fine job of explaining the origins of Dutch resentment of the British in South Africa, how the bullying of the British led to the tragedy that was the Boer War, and how England's desire for reconciliation following the war led to the state-sponsored discrimination instituted by the Afrikaners that would have disastrous effects for South Africa throughout the 20th century."
4,Extensive history of the British side of the Boer War,"Pakenham's exploration of the Boer War is dense and exhaustive, but ultimately readable. It traces the follies, bloodshed, and innovations that surrounded the war that began with the British annexation of the Transvaal region. Goes through the major battles and politics in close detail, but is lacking most sense of the Dutch/Boer perspective on the war. I would like to have seen more about the concentration camps from the Boer side and it would have been interesting to have more coverage of the European (particularly Dutch) response to the British actions."
4,A real classic,"South African illustrated edition. Bought on the Jan Smuts Airport in Johannesburg, and I spent most of the trip home to Norway reading. Flights are boring so I always try to read something and this book made me enjoy the flight. Well written. Not extensively illustrated but sufficient - and adequat maps of the main battles. Describes especially the foreplay of the war in an excellent manner."
2,not all it's cracked up to be,I loved the artwork John Byrne has always been a favorite of mine but unfortunatly that's all I got out of this book. the story jumps around too much I wasn't really sure where i was in the story. The charecters were not as fleshed out as I anticipated. To shorten my critique It's a beautifull package but not much more than that.
1,Worst. Origin. Ever.,"I bought this from Amazon because someone recommended it to me. Clearly, this is the most overrated Superman story ever conceived. I have read a lot of Superman stories, and every origin of Superman ever written, from the newspaper strips to Superman: The Secret Years, to Superman:Birthright is better than this one.In fact, buy Superman: Birthright instead."
5,John Byrne--WORLD's Best Storyteller!!,"I will never get tired of a good, old-fashioned John Byrne story. He is always able to take and insignificant book/character and give it cosmic importance. Where many writers and/or artists have failed to craft an interesting story--John Byrne consistently SUCCEEDS! When you read a John Byrne story, you never want it to end. Thank you, Mr. Byrne for all the years you put into the industry elevating your craft."
3,Man of Steel,"It's okay. This is a very classic looking book, and its all very beautiful on a technical level, but I guess I was just hoping for more. Compared to Ultimate Spider-Man, this retelling/reboot just can't compete. I guess you had to be there back in '86 when all the changes and updates to the Superman mythology were new and could surprise you."
5,An interesting re-boot story,"Back in 1986, when this story was first published, I was just barely beyond the learning to walk stage chronologically. As I got older, I started reading comic books. Superman began to take his place as my favorite title. People recommended that I read his 86 re-boot and so I as a first step ordered this book. I have to say that Ther Man of Steel: Vol 1 is no doubt an incredible piece of writing from John Byrne. in the near future, I intend on buying subsequent volumes to learn more about my favorite heroes beginnings. At the same time and not to go to far off topic, I also liked the PRE-CRISIS superman. I understand why he had to be re-booted though. This book is a must read for any Superman fan."
2,smad,"This is my 3rd set. PIAA Intense White were the best. Sylvania had a bright white color, but the pattern on the road was terrible. Just bought these thinking, these would be more intense white and/or purple bluish tint, neither is true compared to the PIAA intense white bulbs. The PIAA website description claims 5000K, but does not look it at all. My best bet would be the PIAA intense white PLUS next time. PIAA bulbs are far superior for the on-road pattern compared to Sylvania silverstar bulbs."
5,Did just fine for me,"While they're not ""super bright,"" they work just fine for me. They're bright enough and definitely better than the stock bulbs I had and they provide a nice color. I've owned other PIAA bulbs and these met my expectations. If you want something to blind oncoming traffic, maybe you should consider H.I.D.s?"
5,A Most Appropriate Find!,"Literally, a find indeed. I have used several of the more popular Mapping and Phone listing programs for what I use this software for, and I have even used previous versions of Street Atlas and Phone Disc, but this is by far the best as a combination. In comparison the mapping is superb, and the phone listings have not let me down yet. The ease of use for a package of this caliber amazes me. You get so much for a reasonable price! I can't say enough about the product. If you are looking for Business, Personal or Census Info. This one is Very Good! And it doesn't take Big Blue to run the program! I'm happy with it."
4,Wrong label and discription for this item,"First look at the label, it shown Vicent Zhao and Peter Ho in the Wind Cloud TV series 2002 [...]. Is this a false advertise? I have not see the 1998 TV series, but the 2002 that I saw on youtube.com was great. Vicent's fighting skill as well as Jet Li. It was entertaining and addicting like any great TV series. I am going to get the correct content from [...]."
5,What A Plot!!!,This movie puts so many other local movies to shame. Such a big plot! So many intracacies. Why is this not a video game yet?!!!
1,The worst martial art movie ever?,"This one has to be the worst Chinese martial art movie I have ever seen. I know that the movie is based on Chinese comic book, but the story is ridiculous. And the fighting scenes... they are some of the worst choreographed fighting scenes ever, if i can call them fighting scenes. Avoid this one like the plague~!!"
1,Puzzled,"I am surprised by all the positive reviews here on Amazon. Even more amazing is that this was supposed to be one of HK's top films last year. I am still scratching my head. This is supposed to be a fantasy action/martial arts film, but the fight scenes totalled only 20 minutes in this 90 minute film. The fight scenes, often mixed with CGI effects, were so fast that they were difficult to follow. Curiously, the special effects made the few martial arts sequences messy and confusing to watch. Furthermore, like many other Hong Kong films, the script, plot, and acting were nonsensical. It is movies like Storm Riders that reinforces the reputation of Hong Kong cinema as corn."
5,fantastic!,"this movie is based on a popular comic. the special effects are very nice. the fighting moves are great and the casts give a good performance. the extras on the dvd are also quite good for a chinese show. but if u know the original story, you might not like this show because it changed a lot of things from the comic. any way, i feel that this is a must get dvd."
4,Pretty good,"This film is pretty good, the action is well done, and the special effects are good. This being said they tended to overuse the special effects. The last fight is really pretty boring with all three guys just shooting light out of thier hands, no real hand to hand combat at the end was kind of disapointing. This movie is very well put togeather, it has a good story, good special effects and the action is good as well. Overall I like this film just wish it had a little more hand to hand fighting and a little less colors shooting out of everyone's hands. People have said that the two main characters are too pretty but I believe they pull off their roles nicely as Wind and Cloud. I recomend this movie, but there are better Hong Kong action movies, like Iron Monkey, Tai Chi Master, and the Once upon a time in China series, also Fire Dragon and Dragon Inn these are all better films."
3,"Good action, bad editing, and a so so story","This movie was supposed to be a sequel to the well received Hong Kong action feast Storm Riders. What it is seems to be more of a TV series edited to be a full length movie. The cuts are bad and the English dub, is sub par, especially the annoying villain. However the fights were amazing, and the special effects, though not on the level of Hollywood or even Hong Kong blockbusters were entertaining. I gave the movie 3 Stars for it's great, though Power Rangeresque action, and it's full hearted but low budgeted attempt at making a sequel to a movie I thought really needed one. If you like the first movie and you like over the top action, you'll like this movie. But if you're looking for a movie that has the same feel and polish as the first movie you will be dissapointed."
2,Soap opera?,Thought I was actually going to see a sequel to the original movie. Instead It looked like a cut up version of a tv series. Not much action and story was confusing because too many pieces were cut out.
2,A Video Game on Film,"I had high hopes for this one, but was left very disappointed. I'd assume that most people are watching this hoping for cool fight scenes, but the ones in Storm Riders are way too short and too focused on effects. It comes across as a really long cut scene from Final Fantasy or some other video game instead of an actual movie."
1,Not the one I was hoping for....,I ordered this movie thinking it was the one I watched before and was EXTREMELY disappointed! Was only able to watch 10 minutes of it and turned it off. I was finally able to watch the whole DVD and HATED it! I wasn't able to even GIVE this DVD away!!! Hopefully this time I found the right DVD (the 1998 one)
3,Taiwanese version not as good as Hong Kong one,"The actor list which includes Takeshi was what prompted me to buy this, but he wasn't in the movie at all! The other thing is that although containing some special effects, it pails in comparison to the earlier movie version made in Hong Kong starring Ekin Cheng and Arron Kwok because the storyline ran a little wide. It is supposed to be the sequel to the story, but seemed more like a poorly made drama serial - any avid drama serial watcher usually is able to tell the diff between the hong kong made ones from the inferior ones made else where simply because the hong kong made ones have better execution, direction and script because of their experience."
3,can someone give a review on this disc please,"I JUST WANNA KNOW IF THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIE STORM RIDERS, BECAUSE THE COVER OF THIS WIND AND CLOUD CERTAINLY LOOKS DIFFERENT."
1,The movie is good but the dvd sucks.,"This is a good movie, but the DVD works like a cheap bootleg. My DVD player was fresh out the box and for some odd reason this DVD kept skipping parts of the movie."
1,Totally dissapointing,"This movie has received rave reviews from almost every reviewer on multiple different HK cinema websites. It is also one of the poorest movies I have ever seen. My hands literally shook with anticipation when I saw The Storm Riders at my local video store. I had heard so much about it and when I saw that Sonny Chiba was one of the actors, I nearly lost it. Needless to say, I was quite saddened by this trashy CGI laden attempt at a martial arts flick. I thoroughly enjoyed ""A Man Called Hero"" which also starred Ekin Cheng because the CGI effects really enhanced the film and helped create a surreal and fascinating enviroment. In this movie the effects are so overused there technically isn't even a single fight sequence in the entire thing. Every encounter involves merely shooting strange energy balls and putting up magical shields and a whole bunch of other nonsense. Not one martial arts technique was used and even if you don't look at it as a kung fu movie, it's still terrible."
4,WIND AND CLOUD...Storm Riders Part 2,Wind And Cloud is part 2 of the original Stormriders starring Aaron Kwok and Ekin Cheng. Vincent Zhao sure can fight...for those who know his work in THE BLADE and FIST POWER know that this guy delivers and isn't giving you some half baked attempt at a kung fu kick. Great martial arts flick. Highly entertaining.
1,Very Over Rated,"Well, when I finally saw this movie I was extremely disappointed to say the least. I had heard so much good stuff about it and none of it was true. The fight scenes last about 2 seconds each, the characters are paper thin and the plot is like a rejected story from Dragon Ball. If you want good quality HK movies, try A Chinese Ghost Story, Bride With White Hair, Time & Tide, Iron Monkey, Comet Butterfly & Sword, but be warned, stay clear of the Storm Riders...."
2,The Storm Riders,This is 1 of the best movies I've ever seen it's really cool...if u like visual effects then this is 4 u...buy it..keep it and see it again and again....I am sure that if they invested more money in this film it would look even better and better.
2,too heavy on special effects.,The charcters and story are great but it's all ruined by the special effects and lack of decent fight scenes.
3,Storm Riders,"I love this movie, my sons remember watching it with me when they were little. This version however has english subtitles which makes it hard to watch. Still a good family action movie."
2,Not in English,When I purchashed this movie it did not indicate that it was not in English. I wanted this movie because I had seen it on tv in egnlish. I was very disappointed to see that I had to read the whole movie. Still looking for the English version.
4,Kung Fu + Anime + Star Wars = Storm Riders,"Storm Riders is a high-voltage martial arts epic fantasy that took a lot of risks and gambles with its special effects. The bet paid off - characters fly, shoot power balls, swing flaming swords at dragons, and rip off their own limbs. By Hollywood standards, the effects are mediocre, but don't let that discourage you,it looks great.The Street Fighter Sonny Chiba is Conquer, lord of someting or other. He, you guessed it, conquers the land with his forcefully adopted sons Wind and Cloud. (He killed their parents because of a prophecy, etc.) Wind and Cloud feud over Conquer's daughter and split the clan. There's more, but I'll stop here. High energy anime style action throughout.I loved this movie for its creative special effects and non-stop action. Sonny Chiba's voice is deep and resonating, he sounds great as the evil villian, a clear derivative of Darth Vader. A box office record holder in Hong Kong, Storm Riders is a real treat."
2,the actor list is all wrong,"I bought this because I thought Takeshi Kaneshiro is the lead actor. When I got the DVD, then I realized he is not in it at all. Besides, the actor credit is all wrong for this movie. Misadvertisement. DON'T buy this movie if you are looking for ones by Takeshi Kaneshiro"
1,don't say you have not been warned,"This films is all about style and no substance. All the talented actors are wasted on something on cameos and all the pretty faces are on the screen doing absolutly nothing but showing off.Only exception is Sonny Chiba, who is trying to give this heartless piece of celluloid some soul.I recommend only to the fans of Aaron Kwok & Ekin Cheng."
1,Not worth the money,This movie is somewhat confusing. There is no real plot. The kung fu are unreal compared to other kung fu movies. The only entertaining part is just watching the 2 cute main charaters other than that don't waste your money.
3,"Great story, WEAK special effects","For a movie with such a great story and acting, I can not get past the absolutly ridiculous special effects during the fight sequences. Instead of showing the moves of the actors, the directors place swirls of color all over the place, and the blue screen work is hideous. It appears as if they tried to cram as much special effects as they could. I love high flying wire work, and all facets of fantasy martial arts fighting, but the fight scenes looked like a jumble of color rather than fight scenes. This movie is however worth watching for the wonderful storyline. It is both cool and moving. The acting is also top notch. While the fight scenes come close to ruining this great movie, they don't go that far. I would still recommend this movie to any fan of the genre."
1,This is not a Kung-Fu movie!,"This movie is beyond ridiculous. The effects are horrible, there is no plot, and the fight scenes are juvenile. The worst thing is that this is not a martial arts film. If you are a fan of The Power Rangers, then this movie is for you! If you like kung-fu flicks (Drunken Master, Fists of Legends) then avoid this movie at all costs."
1,Don't waste your time,I didn't like this movie. I didn't like the look of the film or it's simplistic plot. Move on.
1,Duplication,Growing Orchids is a duplication of The Practical Encyclopedia of Orchids by the same authors.
1,Inefficient way to learn Perl,"The author doesn't know how to write a book in a didactic way. He uses concepts in his examples without explaining them until later chapters. In the chapter where he finally attempts to explain something that he used earlier, he refers you back to the beginning chapters where he mentioned its use. His chapter on OOP should be skipped all together. His explanation of patterns is sketchie. His chapter on CGI programming is a poor introduction.The typos, grammar, and overall flow of the book demonstrate that he wasn't interested in spending the time to put some thought into the project.I have over 12 years of experience with C++ and other languages, and I think that this is one of the worst presentations I've come across in years.He really makes the learning process a lot harder than it needs to be. Look elsewhere."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"The examples are full of typos which will have you going crazy trying to figure out why it doesn't work. How can you learn a language when the material you are learning from is wrong!?!? Finally went and bought Perl 5 for Windows NT in 21 days. Now that is the book you need. Normally I wouldn't advocate anything with ""21 days"" in the title but this book is definitely the exception. But whatever you do, don't buy ""Perl from the ground up"" unless you like headaches."
4,Its true,"The book cover boasts 'Open this Book as a Novice and Finish it as a Pro'. The book has excellent material on the fundamentals and examples that work. The language basics are easy to understand and implement. The book covers enought object oriented concepts to get you started. There is minimal coverage of regular expressions, so get outside reading on this powerful Perl feature. Open this book, and write code that works."
1,"Typo Nightmare, High ""Huh?"" Factor","Don't buy this book. Here's why: 1) It is full of typos. If you're new to Perl like I am, they'll make your head swim. 2) I read and re-read and read again the explanation of refereces and multidimnsional arrays on pages 48 to 53. I know less about that topic now than when I started."
3,Sample Code Buggy and Unavailable,"I purchased this book in Sept 98. When some sample scripts didn't work, I tried to download the source code. The file was incomplete and corrupt. I contacted both the publisher and the author. Although both admitted the errors, the same broken file is still there as of Dec 98. As the sample code in the book was buggy, a source of error free source code and book errata is what is needed. Can we please see this sometime soon?"
3,Good basics but example code very buggy!,"The book starts off very well, and gives a good grounding in PERL, but is badly let down by very buggy example scripts. You can type them in exactly as printed and get pages of error messages. I was also less than impressed with the Windows NT / Unix information, which doesn't point out the myriad of facilities which do not work in the NT version of PERL (Ping, for example is supposed to work, but as of August 1998 relies on an alarm function which is not implemented in PERL for Windows NT. To be brutal, PERL's own HTML pages have been more helpful once I got beyond chapter four."
2,"Great book, great soundtrack, bad movie","I watched the movie because I read the book and listened to the soundtrack since I was a kid. But the editing is some of the worst I've ever seen. They used a butcher's knife to edit this movie. Scenes cut in and out at the wost places - the theme soundtrack cuts in abrubtly and ends just as abtrubtly. The movie lacks passion or the sense and feel that it deserves. Watch it if you must, but you'll probably be disappointed just as I was."
3,"I love this film, but...","I've always had a soft spot for this movie, which was filmed mostly in and around Esfahan, Iran in 1977 while I was living and working there. The script unfortunately doesn't do justice to Michner's novel, but the scenery is beautiful and Mike Batt's soundtrack is exceptional. Some of the acting is truly awful and borderline embarrasssing (particularly Joseph Cotten and Michael Sarrazin). All this said, I confess to loving this movie as in many ways it is a trip down memory lane for me. I orginally recorded the film from TV onto VHS tape about 15 years ago and was glad to see it finally out on DVD....although the DVD quality is poor, unfortunately. I wish there had been some extra features on the DVD as well."
3,Caravans the movie lacks passion,"I bought this movie having never seen it before. My father purchased the sound track album in the early 80s and my whole family flipped over this sound track. The sound track is one of the best sound tracks I have ever heard. It is very moving. I was in my early twenties when I fell in love with this sound track and now in my fortys, I still crank the volume for the caravan theme song. I had heard the movie was not very good even though it has a lot of big names. In my opinion the movie lacks passion. You do not feel the passion that the missing wife has for the life she is now leading and never understand why she left her husband or even married him. You do not feel the love that any man has for her and three men are in love with her. The only thing and it's a BIG plus is that the movie comes with the soundtrack. The sound track is worth every bit of the cost of the movie."
3,There are two reasons to view this film . . .,". . . a super soundtrack that has haunted me for years and the stunning views of the Iranian desert. I saw this movie back in the early 80s and managed to tape it the next time it came on--and that was the last I heard of it. I'd watch my ""edited for TV"" tape every so often and have nagging memories of what was left out. I do like this movie. True, Jennifer O'Neill is totally incongruous amongst the nomads, but hey, it's a movie. I am glad it's finally available on DVD, but the film quality is poor. One of the extras is the sountrack--and that makes it worth the purchase. On a side note, when I first saw the film, I went and read Michener's novel. I didn't like Ellen as well, but the cultural and historical aspects I picked up on Afghanistan have served me well these past 25 yrs."
5,Excellent product,I burn a lot of CD/DVD lables. These work well. Iwould buy again. The price is very agresive too. Thanks.
2,25 Percent Failure Rate!,"This is the second box of 20 I purchased. No bad burns in any of the first 20, plus the other pack of 10 I got from Amazon. This is discouraging, especially after buying Verbatim USB Flash drives recently, which are pathetically slow. Prices go down, and perhaps, quality goes with it. So far, 3 coasters out of 12 used. I use the slowest 10X rate for burning, and still Verbatim CDs fail."
5,Excellent product,"Great sound, great Lightscribe image, great gold color, great price for 50 whole CDs! I would definitely recommend this product."
1,BAD MEDIA!,Lots of coasters!I contacted Verbatim with no response.Awful product support!I'm using a new Dell 18x burner using Nero's newest version.Stay away!
1,High failure rate.,"I have purchased 6 x 50 of these in the past. Of the 300 there were 13 fails. Mediocre but not disastrous. I recently purchased 2 x 50 more. All 21 tested have failed. They have been tested on 2 dvd burner systems and 4 computers. They will not load. Morale of the story , you get ( eventually ) what you pay for."
1,Fails with lightscribe,"The first CD worked for the lightscribe burning just fine, then after - nothing.The entire spindle is defective for lightscribe burning. It says ""media not detected,"" and yes, I'm putting them in the correct way.Computer Network Admin 9 years."
2,Not too useful technology,It is not really a review of the discs but rather of the entire LightScribe technology. I am new to this technology - just purchased my first Verbatim discs capable to LightScribing. The quality - mainly contrast (with setting for high contrast) - is so low that I simply cannot understand how this so imperfect technology has survived for several years. And it takes about 30 min to label one disc.
3,Weird color,"I wouldn't really call the color of these 'gold' but more of a matte yellow-y tan. They work fine, shipped quickly... just a little strange on the color. I'll probably just get plain white or silver next time."
4,Better than HP's discs,"I'd been having trouble with the LightScribe process. I triple checked that I had all the latest drivers. I futzed with the software. Finally, I decided to try a different batch of discs. Voila! I've gone from having about a 60% failure rate with the HP discs I was using to about a 20% failure rate. Still not perfect, but a significant improvement. In fairness, my HP discs were at least a year old. If there were manufacturing improvements since then, they may apply across the board. All I know is I'm once again a happy LightScribe user."
4,Verbatim CD's for Lightscribe,This item works fairly well-seems like the print doesn't show up as good as it should but it could be I haven't perfected how to use the lightscribe program well enough yet. The music downloaded on them sounds great.
5,Great!,I was very pleased with the service I received. It was just as described and arrived quickly. What else can you ask for.
3,Not for recording music,"Amazon advertised these CD-R's when prompted for music recording media. Be advised that they will not work for transferring music from 33 1/3 discs or tapes on the TEAC or similar units made for such activity. You must use the Memorex or other discs the specifically say ""Music"" in their title. They are more expensive, but necessary to complete the task."
4,Verbatim LightScribe CD-R Discs,"As with my previous review of the DVD-R discs, these arrived in the same condition, hot and with a cracked spindle cover. They also performed well for both recording and labeling. I did want to mention that someone else's invoice was in the box. Imagine my wife's surprise at seeing an invoice for baby wet wipes and pampers. My credit card reflected the correct amount so no worries but somebody in shipping is napping."
5,Really cool product!,"If you have a lightscribe cd burner - these disks are great! You can print your label RIGHT on the disc - very cool! Quick shipment, quality product/packing."
5,Great for LightScribe drives,"I haven't experimented with other brands of LightScribe CD-R's, but based on bad reviews of others, I stick with these. They work great and create impressive labels with the LightScribe drive."
5,Lightscribe blank DVD's,Verbatim is the best of any lightscribe DVD's currently available on today's market. I would not bother experimenting with other brands.
4,Verbatim 95460 CD's,The color option makes the light scribe a little more noticable.The Vervatim disks record and maintain fidelity very well.The light scribe option is not as crisp as with Hewlett Packard disks.
1,Lightscribe CD's,The spindle of these Verbatim LightScribe disks that I purchased was an extraordinary disappointment. My Nero Lightscribe writer only recognized one of these disks one out of ten trys and on that occasion it mis-printed.
1,"Wow, these are a waste!","I bought two of the 30 packs of Verbatim Lightscribe CDRs from Best Buy. I would be very optimistic in saying that 1 out of 3 actually worked. Oh, the music burns on to them no problem, but when I flip them over to do the lightscribe label, it tells me the media is not recognized as lightscribe. This happens no matter what program I use! And what sucks even worse is that with the coating on the cd, it's almost impossible to write on, so you end up with an un-labeled cd anyways.Oh well, back to the HP discs :)"
1,Very disappointed.,This product is supposedly for the lite scribe machines however after attempting to scribe each and every disc in the pack none would work. Several other brands worked just fine however so I will not be using this product again.
5,"Great CDs, Lasting Results","I bought a package of these Verbatim color lightscribe CDs over a year ago and have made many wonderful gift-quality CDs for friends and family. Early on, I messed up the burning on a red CD (my fault), so I burned a fun image with lots of variable contrast on the lightscribe side. I've truly mistreated this CD. I've left it in the sun, lost if for a while under the couch, and it has sat for months under my halogen desk lamp. The printing has not faded at all, and has maintained its original contrast. Other than this single CD, I have had NO coasters."
1,horrible,these discs stink the scribing does not last on them unlike the non colored discssave your money
1,Nice results don't last,"I've had good results with other Verbatim LightScribe discs, but I won't use the colored discs again. They looked terrific when I first burned them, but after about two weeks the images started to fade and blur - even on discs that were stored indoors and out of sunlight."
1,Overall Very Bad Quality,"Got a 25 pack of the colored CD-Rs. After going through all 25 I now have 15 working discs and 10 coasters. Half of the ones that did work aren't recognized on my Mac or on my PC, it just shows that there are 0 bytes available and 0 bytes free (though they do play in my CD player in my car). The ones I could get to burn I had to put in multiple times before iTunes would recognize it as a blank CD, and Toast completely froze whenever trying to burn some discs and had to Force Quit. Had no problems with burning the labels, though even after adjusting contrast settings they're not very dark and look somewhat blurry. Overall it's just an incredibly bad product and I'm very dissatisfied."
1,Fading Fast!,"I thought I was buying a high quality product in Verbatim. And even though I have not had any trouble recording music or burning with LightScribe, the fact is the images DO fade over time leaving you with a rather shabby/disgusting looking CD. I made a number of CDs for gifts to family and friends and I will likely end up cutting new ones (on another brand, of course). Live and learn."
3,"Good product, recieved in bad condition","The lightscribe cdrs work as advertised no problems there at all, the shipping was quick BUT upon delivery the case for the Lightscribe CDRS was cracked on one side. I'm VERY glad that nothing was fragile in the package or else I would have had to return it. The ""it's okay"" review was for mainly the cracked case of CDRS."
5,Works as described,"My review is on the product itself, not the LightScribe technology.I expect my CD's to come out with 80min max of whatever music I choose every time. This technology should not have many flaws at this stage. And... they don't. I have performed 10 or so burned compilations without fail. Designs are laser etched every time. The CD's do what is expected of them. 5 stars for the CD's though they smudge real easily - cosmetic issue only.LightScribe is another issue, and while it's my first time using the technology, I expected better.TIP: I'm sure its a combination of the software to design them and the burner itself, but unless the images used in the design are dark, you won't get a good result."
5,Lightscribe CD's,Item was just as described plus shipped in a timely manner. 5 stars in my book!!!!!!!!!Bill
4,verbatim 95115 700 mb 52x 80min lightscribe disc cd-r 10-disc spindle,it is good!! i would buy again if i didn't need many of them but i would probably buy the larger count. it is good!! it is good!! it is good!!
2,"Watch out, probably won't fit","Two stars because it looks like the unit will do what it says, PROVIDED your camera isn't very big. Mine (a medium-sized Canon S2 IS) is WAY too big, front to back. There isn't much adjustment in that dimension, and the web page says nothing about that. Misleading.I happen to have a Canon A410 compact handy. That one fits, but with only about half an inch to spare, and that's a very small camera with a pretty modest lens projection.So, if you have a long-zoom camera and you were hoping to get even more zoom out of it by attaching it to a scope...forget this item. Only compact cameras will work."
5,Good choise!!!! Great Recording!!!,"It is very hard for any band to replace one musician, but it is harder if you need to get a new singer. Queen finally decided to play the cards and go out and play with one of the best rock singers ever: Paul Rodgers. What they have done is to let the 3 of them sing. You can even hear Freddie Mercury s' voice when Brian May takes the lead vocals on some of the songs, particularly ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".....This is a solid record by one of Rocks best bands ever."
2,DISAPPOINTING,I WAS SO LOOKING FOWARD TO HEARING THIS ALBUM AND HAD MAYBE UNREASONABLE EXPECTATIONS DUE TO PAUL ROGERS FRONTING QUEEN - THE FIRST DISC SOUNDED MUFFELED AND THE ENGINEERING WAS HORRIBLE -DISC 2 WAS BETTER SUNDING BUT SOMEHOW PAUL ROGERS DID NOT PULL OFF THE NECESSARY VOCAL RANGE NEEDED TO FRONT QUEEN -HOWEVER THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN THAT PAUL ROGERS HAS A BLUES AND NOT A POP VOICE.
4,Paul Rodgers is the highlight,"Five stars for Paul Rodgers, but the Queen-only tracks definitely take it down to an average of 4. I was a Queen fan in high school/college and saw them in concert in 1982; they disappointingly just phoned in their performance. I very, very rarely listen to the old recordings anymore, as they strike me as faddish and dated. But I've been a Paul Rodgers fan since Free, and for me, he's the real thing and brings passion, sincerity, and energy to the Queen material. For me, he's the reason to buy this CD. His vocals are incredible; in his mid-50s, he's a better singer now than he was 30 years ago. (He looks a lot better now than he did then, too; get the DVD.)"
3,"Instrumentally great, vocally fair","While this CD is no embarrassment to Queen or Freddie Mercury, Paul Rodgers' vocals can make the listener hyper-aware of Freddie's absence. In contrast to George Michael who sings Queen songs as if they were written for him, Paul Rodgers struggles to deal with the musical range of many songs here and covering his range limitations with Bad Company gritty vocals doesn't help. The one success on this CD is the new version of Hammer To Fall which Rodgers makes his own and is a beautiful slow remake of this hard rocker.At the same time, the band is flawless and reproduces the Queen musical sound as well as ever before. This excellent instrumental effort does compensate for other cd weaknesses and may make the cd worthwhile for many Queen fans."
2,"Not bad, but not a classic","Having been a lifelong fan, I wasn't expecting too much from this watered-down version of Queen minus the late Freddie Mercury. If ""The show must go on"", they should have done it with someone other than Paul Rodgers. He doesn't like to stick around in one band too long. To a degree, the album works. If for no other reason than to hear what these guys have been up to. All the hits are included on this CD however, it would have been nice to hear some new material. Paul Rodgers doesn't have the vocal range for a lot of the familiar favorites like ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Another one bites the dust"" and ""Radio ga ga"". This CD is mediocre at best. If Rodgers sticks with the group past their concert tour, I'd be interested in hearing a studio album however, I wish they would drop the name. These guys are established enough already individually. I'd give it a spin."
1,A Crying Shame,"Dont be fooled by all the other rave reviews. This is NOT a Queen album, and this band is NOT Queen. This is Brian May and Roger Taylor blatantly grovelling for money and attention. Queen's music deserves more respect than this hard rock sludge fest. I saw Queen twice in the 70s and have collected every piece of live video and audio I can get my hands on. May and Taylors playing on this piece of junk is lackluster and uninspired. If they truly were interested in being the most progressive innovative rock band they once were, they would have auditioned for a proper singer and plummed their back catalog for superior material. This is a shameless greatest hits show with a third rate Robert Plant clone who knows nothing about dramatic vocal interpretation. Spend your money on ""On Fire At the Bowl"" and see what Queen was really like!"
5,Welcome back Queen. Freddy would be proud.,"When I first heard that Paul Rogers (former lead singer of Bad Co.) was going to tour & record with Queen, I wasn't sure how it would sound. How could you replace a distinctive voice like Freddy Mercury? When I heard some cuts from this album, I was amazed. Rogers sounded better than ever and was hitting some seriously high notes without losing it. He doesn't come off as trying to imitate Freddy. Rather, this album offers new renditions of the old Queen classics, as well as a couple of Rogers' own early classics. In short, the combination works out great & proves that Queen is alive and well and are still ""Killers."" I think Freddy would be proud."
3,Good but another singer should have been picked,"Im a big fan of Queen and Paul Rodgers but this is a mismatch.I remember when George Micheal covered ""Somebody To Love"" with Queen at the Concert For Life at Wembely.He really nailed it.George Michael would have been a great pick to fill in for Freddy Mercury.As much as I like Rodgers,he just doesnt have the vocal range for Queen.That said,the cd is worth a listen just for the high energy.Brian May still rocks!"
2,Not so good,"This is the worst thing Queen...er...half of Queen...have ever done. It's even worse than Hot Space. Kudos to John Deacon for sitting this one out. Paul Rodgers just cannot sing these songs, and he sounds ridiculous trying. I like the songs that Brian and Roger sing, but that's about it. If you want to hear Queen songs performed live, don't buy this. Instead, buy Queen at Wembley Stadium or Queen On Fire- Live at the Bowl. This cd is for the most hardcore Queen fans only. I'm a pretty hardcore Queen fan, and I almost hate this album. This is not Queen. This is half of Queen, that dude from Bad Company, and three other guys most people have never heard of. This cd will only make you want to hear Freddie. Let's just hope they don't do a studio album."
1,BIGGEST DISGRACE IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC,"This gets a - 100 score from me. And the same with the so called new joke Doors. My jaw drops when I see anyone giving this 5 stars. They definitely were not true Queen fans. I have no comprehension or understanding of disgracing Freddie's name with this total nonsense. Might as well have Ringo and Paul get replacements for John and George, huh? What do those think of that that give this a good score. Might as well keep it consistent.A true crying shame and totally intolerable."
3,worth a listen,"Here is the truth, short and sweet. Queen on the Free and Bad Company tunes, Absolutly awesome. Paul Rodgers on Queen material, hits the mark about 75% of the time, even if he has to change the feel a little. In short, this is not really Queen because there's no Freddie, but it's still great Rock."
1,musical adultery,To try to replace Freddy was a tall order to begin with but Paul Rodgers does not even come close. Too bad George Michael couldn't have worked out a deal with the band- he was the closest they could have come to Freddy. Taylor and May sold out to keep their Queen wet dream alive with a far inferior lead singer. GOD SAVE QUEEN!
4,Very Well Written,"I needed this book for my into to Soc college course and I found the book to be really easy to understand, which made the course that much easier!"
3,Another Textbook for college (BUT WITHOUT ONLINE ACCESS CODE),"This textbook was required in my Sociology class, but same ones that were sold at college bookstore (for almost same price) had CD or code for online access, and this one did not come with one. Thats why I gave it 3 stars. But maybe this is just noCD/noCODE edition, but info should specify it. Other than that the book came in brand new condition."
2,"when you order,its because you NEED the book.","I ordered the book and got a confirmation. Several days later, after all the used books were sold from the book store I got a notice that the seller did not have the book in stock. It was too late to order on line again, as my duaghter needed the book. I had to scour campus to try and find the book used,as new it was very expensive. I had to pay twice as much for a used one that I swould have had to pay on line.Yes I hate this deal......"
2,"Informative, yes. But how do you troubleshoot?","The book was great for specs, but there are no troubleshooting tips, especially for the fuel injection system. It was not as helpful as I thought it would be. I suggest the Bentley shop manual. More money, but well worth it."
5,Great stuff!,"I was so happy to find this on Amazon. I checked several stores that I used to purchase this product and no one had just the regular malt flavor, only the fish, etc. flavor which my kitty does not like. She absolutely loves this stuff. Received this product very quickly from the vendor and I will be ordering again. I like that it was a larger tube than what I was normally purchasing."
3,Stinger Quicklift 3 1/2 Ton Jack,"First time I tried the jack it would not lift. I bleed the unit as directed and it worked once. I had to bleed it two more times to get my car off of the ground to a working position. The jack also leaked some fluid during this time. I have not tried using it again at this time, but I will be using it soon."
1,"A rambling, repeating, mess of information, with few specifics","This book, like many pioneering works, is low on details and a little too preachy for a ""manual"". I was looking for a ""how to"" and what I got was a vague pile of information that could have been pulled together by an average internet searcher."
4,Compost tea,The book is well written and very good. Before I place my order the estimate delivery was three days with any kind of shipping the delivery was more like 10 days. Why is that a problem for a book.
2,Really Good...BUT.,"Since I had my say about Champion's Cotton workout pant... tell you my thoughts on these. I love them, BUT... if you work out alot (and not just when you're sweaty) you will leave a damp spot that takes 20-30 seconds to evaporate...in the exact dimensions of your bottom equipment. Guess because they don't absorb dampness, just transfer it. As a shirt...Dri-Power can't be beat."
2,pants too long!,The fabric is great but the pants are too long (can't hem length since zippers on leg) and the waist tie rope is too short(or maybe I'm too fat).
5,I am buying it again!,"I read this book many years ago. I remember it as the best book I have read on this particular subject. I am re-purchasing it because I know I have given it away at some point in the past and for the price it is an amazing deal. Anyone interested in the subject of faith healing from a Christian, yet not gullable point of view should read this book. I believe in faith healing, I do not believe in every faith healer. This book takes a similar stance - exposing many frauds."
3,the queen of reggae? i really do not know.....read more...,"i was about 11 years old when an older cousin took me to a reggae concert. it was an outside/open door concert. and it figured sister carol. prior to that day, i had heard some of her stuff and was excited to finally see her live. she did not disappoint me. i purschaed her jah disciple about a year ago. first, i must say that i love her voice. it is very soothing. her writing skill is also some-what impressive. my favorite songs on the album are jah disciple and wicked collie. i can tolerate the other songs. however, i expected more...the album simply does not move my consciousness that much. too much experimentation on the instrumentals."
4,Don't listen to the bashing reviewer below (luis hernandez),"whatever this guy says in his review about this cd is sooooooooo not true. I've never heard more of a lie, this is a great cd (except for the ballads, which are somewhat boring) and if you think she's so bad, why don't you try singing, yourself? she's just trying to do what she's always wanted and you should admire her courage to do just that. she is totally wholesome (except for that dress she wore @ the grammys)and a very talented artist. As for the snide remarks about Jennifer's a$$, i think weve all heard enough and it's getting really old"
3,Alright,"I bought it and it is true, she doesn't have the best singing ability but her voice is good enough to pull it off. Some of the songs are ok but others hit you right there if you know what I mean. I'd recommend this CD. But if you are just buying into the hype that she's the greatest thing to the Hispanic culture since dirty rice, don't get your hopes up or see if the good songs are available on singles."
5,Great Book,My daughter is 19 months old and will happily sit through the entire reading of this book without losing interest. The story is great and the pictures are hilarious. I love all of William Wegman's books but this is one of our favorites.
3,had creases in new first edition,"First one had creases, cheerfully replaced by Amazon. Second one not in pristine condition either. Kept them anyway to go with my son's Epiphone Emily guitar.(Guitar Rocks !!!!!!)"
1,Physics was never this dull,I am a physics major at Wyoming State University and have studied physics for the past 10 years of my life. Raymond A. Serway makes another attempt at physics but once again falls horribly short. This book is awful and I would not reccomend it to anyone
5,phantom shifters,"This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard, from start to finish there isnt a bad song on this CD. Classic sounding 70 riff rock with some punk, hard core , straight up balls to the wall rock. You cant go wrong!"
4,Simple and elegant,I used these for my Christmas cards and they looked terrific. The template is easy to use and they printed well. They are sticky enough to stay put (you can't reposition them once they are on). I'm going to use them again next year.
5,Worked Great,"I used these for addressing Christmas cards and they worked great.They were easy to set up and use, adhered well and they looked great!"
3,Disappointed,I've been an Avery labels fan forever. These were disappointing. The ink seemed to take longer to dry than on other sheets I've used before which resulted in some smearing (could only print one sheet at a time because they'd smear if I removed them from the printer right away or if another sheet printed out on top of them).For some reason my black ink didn't adhere. The other colors were OK but plain black seemed to fade to a light shadow. Since the other colors all printed OK I am thinking it might just be my computer.Overall I wasn't as thrilled as I have been with all of my other Avery labels. I think I'll stick with white or clear going forward. The gold was nice for Christmas cards but I don't think it was worth the extra time and hassle.
5,Perfect,"Exactly what I was looking for and the silver is a true, vibrant silver... Definitely worth the price which was very reasonable and shipped very fast.."
3,Does not work on laser printers,I purchased these to use on small trophies to give to my volunteers. I set the printer to what was suggested and it would not print on a Samsung Laser Printer. I really wanted to use these but had to use someting else.
3,Adds a nice accent,"I used these for envelopes for a party. They didn't print out as easily as I'd hoped on our printer but they did work on a laser printer (even though they are marked for inkjet...which I have). That is why I gave a lower rating.Other than that, they were easy to use and I would buy again"
4,A great collection of short films!,"This is a very nice collection of short films. Animation fans should find ""The Bad Plant"", ""Billy's Balloon"", and ""Nocturne"" especially satisfying. They are three of the best animation festival shorts of the past year."
2,I don't get what's so exciting about this book,"When I got this book, I had very high expectations. It got two very prestigious awards and had pretty good ratings but I wasn't impressed after reading the book. The things about the Pattern and crossing between shadows were too confusing. Corwin seem to be the only good prince and should get the crown but he wasn't too smart in trying to usurp Eric. The other books might be better and shed more light on the world of Amber but I like to be pulled into the story from the very beginning not in the middle. This book is also too sci-fi for me. I expected it to be more in the lines of knights and sorcery not Mercedes and guns. This book was disappointing."
5,Captured my imagination and never let go,"Nine Princes in Amber is the first of the original five books in the Amber series. I have reread this series several times and each time it recaptures my imagination like few stories ever have. The unique nature of the universe Zelazny created, the twisting plots, the engaging noir/fantasy characters and the sweeping scope are guaranteed to impress any fan of fantasy or Sci-Fi.You will come to know the members of the royal family of Amber in great detail and you will love and hate them. The story will keep you guessing and the action is well paced. Zelazny is a tight writer and keeps things moving.These days I hear the Amber series described as a ten book series. This isn't accurate, it is composed of two five book series and the less said about the later five books the better. The first five books dealing with Corwin are a complete story that simply must be read.You owe it to yourself to read the five books of the original Amber series."
5,Captivating,"Someone said this book was full of cliches. This book is one the best ever written, but you have to have the ability upstairs to appreciate it. It's sad that some readers cannot get it. It is very esoteric and there are great threads of humor that blend very uniquely with the action and adventure. Zelazny is like many of the unusual great writers that stand out that have surpassed their art form. Why else would it still getting 5 star rave reviews long after it is out of print with no advertizing or publicity to taint it. In this book, there is philosophy, modern science fiction, medieval history and tragedy, the tragedy of the loss of one the great writers who wrote this. I have read a lot of biographies and reviews of Zelazny and, while most reviewers just don't get it, one came close when he said that what is unusual about Zelazny is that he speaks to you with such a perfect voice - the voice of a good friend, who is right there beside you, experiencing the adventure."
5,The best book of Zelazny,I've read this book in french but I can say that it was a book fastly read. I have bought the 10 and I'm playing the game. I think it's the best book for Amber.
5,My favorite book for 17 years,"I read this book when I was 17 and I loved it then. I read it again at 34 and I still loved it. Then my husband, who doesn't normally like to read, picked it up and he was hooked as well. So we bought the whole set. I've read everything from Sir Walter Scott to Shakespeare and beyond but this book will probably always be my favorite. It's a great romp through the pages."
5,Amber - an incredible book about the one true world,"Nine Prines in Amber is a work of art to be remembered for all time. Masterfully written by acclaimed Science Fiction and Fantasy writter Roger Zelazny, Amber will pull you into a world of treachery, mystery and intrigue. You follow the adventures of Corwin, a prince of amber as he plots to achieve the thrown and rule the one true world, where everything else, including Earth is just a shadow of a shadow of reality"
2,I really wanted to like this book,"Original? yes. Lacking any and all emotional impact, yes. I wanted to like this book. I read the other reviews the people here posted and ordered all ten books. I guess its just me, but i thought it was dreadful. This is a warning to any like me who read the reviews for this and may want to buy it. I gave it to my father as well. He stopped after 80 pages with the same opinion as me. I have read many books, but this is among the worst. Perhaps I am too old for the series(25), maybe if I had read it in junior high."
1,Aweful-- Choppy Film Noir dialogue with minimal plot,"I was shocked at just how bad this book was given the high ratings. What did people find to like? The dialogue and internal monologue is uniformly written in short, choppy simple sentences-- like a bad film noir movie. The basic premise isn't explained well enough, even once the protagonist recovers from amnesia. This leaves the readers plodding through action scenes (again with no interesting detail typically) without understanding why the battle, overall journey or any of the characters matter. Avoid this stinker!"
1,Poorly written pulp!,"I came on this book through an Easton Press leather-bound edition and assumed, because of the presentation, that it would have some quality. I have never tried to read more poorly written pulp. It is a complete mystery to me how this could even be considered worthy of publishing, much less a ""classic"". The multiple rave reviews simply convince me that the readers of this genre must have very low standards, like for instance ""romance novel"" readers.The writer's style (or rather lack thereof) wanders all over the place, as do his ""literary allusions"", his characterizations and his ""plot"". Just an extremely lazily written piece of fiction which could perhaps be excused as a very young writer's first effort. Where were the editors on this atrocity?"
4,Unabridged is far superior,"It would be nice if someone could finally offer the unabridged versions on CD-- I believe a lot more diehard fans would come out of the woodwork to buy them. The abridgments (the editing)take a lot of language out of the works...a lot of Zelazny's little touches of charm and wit are lost for unknown reasons. It's good to see the interest, but to reiterate, I would prefer to see the unabridged versions on CD."
5,i was hooked from the ending. :),"the first book is so well written and zelazney is so smooth with transition and imagry, it was a great book. i laughed, i stared in disbelief, i cursed the writer at one point even. i gobbled it up in about three hours and when i got to the end where...sorry, i can't tell you how it ended. let us just say i was hooked from there. my advise. get this and read it. then read the second one. then read the third one. are we seeing a pattern? trust me. once you read one you will have to have all of them, and all of them are worth it. five stars."
4,Scientific Papers,"Used it for scientific research papers in college. Great reference, easy to understand, plenty of examples."
3,Good Guide,This is a good guide to write papers. It is a little hard to follow but I do recommend this book. This guide was recommended to by my Marine Ecology professor.
5,An English Book for Science Majors,"Most science students know that the MLA Manual of Style is useless for their classes, specially with writing intensive professors. This book is the answer to that problem. It is an English book that is tailored to the Biology discipline, even thought Im certain chemists and physicists could use it too. The spiral binding makes it easy to flip though and to have it at your desk. The first chapter also includes a list of databases that can enhance those already available through your university website. I recommend this for any undergraduate or master's student (even high school students in AP biology could use this book)."
2,Fast Read - Thank Goodness!,"Nothing remarkable about the story or the characters. Thom just a little to good to be true, yes I know it's a romance but come on!It reads fast but the character development leaves much to be desired."
5,Moen hand held shower wand,"Great great item! So easy to install! The plumber's tape that is required is included with the package. It's tiny, so keep your eyes peeled. Great wand with pause control. The long hose is wonderful and convenient. I searched the internet for hours looking for the right wand and couldn't find any others at much higher prices, that had a pause function. If you're looking for a hand held (it also has a cradle it sits in if you want a regular type shower) please consider this one. You won't be disappointed! Well worth the money and cheaper than many! My 80 year old mother uses it daily and just loves it!"
2,Worked for just one year and a week,"I purchased this for my dad so he could shower with a bench and an extra long hose was needed. I have had the impression that Moen was a quality manufacturer but the hose fitting began to leak, my dad tried to replace the o-ring which didn't solve the problem, and he overtightened the plastic hose fitting which promptly broke. Thanks Moen."
5,Love the shutoff & extra long hose,"I was skeptical about buying a showerhead marketed for special needs but the removable handle, shutoff button and the extra long hose have made me a convert. I'm ordering another one for the new house soon. It's well made, has been in daily use for almost a year with zero problems. I installed this in about 15 minutes and have used it to wash my baby since birth. The nozzles are easy to clean and haven't needed much cleaning since it's been installed. The shutoff button is super handy for soaping up and shaving. There is just enough water trickling out during shutoff to clean the razor or get soap off my hands. Spray patterns are simple but pretty strong and easy to adjust, even one handed. I actually love everything about it."
2,Leaks From The Seams,The shower head that I received was defective. I sent it back. Water not only came out of the intended holes in the head but also came out of all the seams down the sides of the entire hand set. I was looking forward to the pause feature on the showerhead thinking it would be convenient when bathing my dogs. Unfortunately it did not work out and I'm leary or ordering another one.Aesthetically the shower head is attractive except the hose is a bit strange. It is just a gray soft plastic hose that was rather stiff but it was nice and long and looked like it would last even though it was a little ugly.
3,Nice enough,"My mother in Law is 87, and we recently bought her a Shower Seat. Well, that is fine, but it is kind of hard to use with a standard shower head. So I ordered her this one. Fine, it has a longer hose, and has 3 spray settings, plus pause. That is fine. However, hubby was putting it together, and it just snapped in his hand. The little connector on the end of the hose was so cheap, that is broke. He had no tools, just his fingers. I called Moen, and they are sending out a new piece, it should be here Friday. But for it to be that weak, I am a bit disturbed. The thing will be fine, but I am very nervous about a handicapped shower head being so fragile. After all, if she drops the head, is it going to break again?"
4,Where's the proof!,"The Eye is another King Diamond classic! It's a story about witchcraft, nuns, and priests that are based on real people from the French inquisition. An innocent women is burned at the stake for witchcraft. The next day two little girls are playing in her ashes and find a necklace called ""The Eye""..."
4,Look into the EYE - this is based on fact!,"King spent much time and research getting the tracks just-so, and digging up the stories behind them. He even had help from the late Anton LaVey to get this project done right. The theme is the horror of the Chamber of Fire in France, with the witch-craze and fanaticism of the age...the northern cousin of the Inquisition, or Salem, Massachusetts. A magical necklace has the power to take you back there and of course, someone has to pick it up and look into ""the eye"" opening the door... As usual, King's work borders reality and becomes darker and scarier for it. A real artist who finally hit a subject that got him into BMG magazine when it was released. This is hardcore - not for those who just like the small shiver up their spine."
5,One of the classix,"You have to admit it-This is one of the King's best works next to Abigal and the ""Them"" triology.The title track is a beautiful piece of music and art.It does make a point that someone with a high athority will always abuse it's power and will.If you say you are a metal head and listen to those Mtv ""rap/metal"" bands.....DIE.Stop ruining the name of metal.King Diamond, Mayhem, and Slayer are my gods"
3,Get to know your Porsche,"The Haynes manual covers all aspects of service and repairs of your 924 and lets you follow a complete disassembly/reassembly of the car in text and pictures.The book does have a few faults, and lacks some details here and there, but overall it gives you a great insight in how the car works and what it takes to do repairs.Combine this book with the 924 Workshop manual, the PET (Porsche Electronic parts guide), Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management, and participate at www.924board.org, and you will be equipped with all the info you need to do any kind of repairs or restoration on your Porsche 924 or 924 Turbo.It's possible to learn everything about the 924 without this book, but reading this book first will get you there 10 times faster. Recomended!"
5,Gorgeous Hostess set,"My Oneida Wedgwood Gold Seville 5-Piece Hostess set arrived promptly, a couple of days from when I placed the order. It's got very high quality and the design is very elegant! I have been hand-washing my set to protect the gold accent from fading with the dishwasher and I don't see any fading so far. I highly recommend it!"
3,Not bad but...,"I purchased these rings to mount a Barska 30 mm scope on a Crosman 1377 with a steel breech.The good news is the rings are of solid construction and seem fairly sturdy.The bad news is they will not tighten up enough to synch the scope to the breach rails tightly, allowing the scope assembly to slide fore and aft.They may work on another gun just fine, it is really a question of close tolerances. For the money, they maybe worth the gamble on your .22 or pellet gun, but won't work on mine."
1,What Was I Thinking?,"Terrible book. There's not even a mention of the Thunderbolt GreaseSlapper, Baron Otto Matic, Gertie Growler or even Clutcher.I'm kidding, of course, but inclusion of these characters might have at least generated a little interest into the ridiculous yeti legend.Tom Slick and the Yeti? Well, he went on one expedition, then his mother (I'm not making this up) told him he couldn't go on any further trips to Nepal because he bruised his knees(!). He sponsored a couple more, but that's about it.The evidence for proof of the existence of the 'abominable snowman'? Droppings. Yes, they found yeti crap, in numerous places all over Nepal. And tracks that could have been made by some other animal, maybe a snow leopard. Probably the source of the droppings also.Pure speculation, and not worth wasting your time reading it."
5,Not your everyday J-pop...,"I was pleasantly surprised when I purchased this album. I saw the video for ""Hino Tori"" (track # 3) and impulsively purchased the entire album.Even though this album may be categorized as J-pop; this artist deserves far better than to be banished to the ranks of the Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson-types. Instead, she delivers complex lyrics backed by a musical score that is infused with Jazz and Latin (and maybe a little Caribbean on track # 9??) beats.I'm actually reviewing this album after I purchased it a second time (I carried my first copy around everywhere and it became too scratched to play properly)."
5,GREAT- I CAME TO THE SITE TO LOOK FOR MORE FROM CAMPUDONIO,"It's funny that zzz.cat says it reminds him of Antoine De Saint Exupery, because my boyfriend's two favorite books in the whole world are The Little Prince and Wendal, His Cat, and the Progress of Man. He bought them for me for Christmas '97, and I absolutely treasure them. ""Wendal"" is good to let people read when you wish to learn more about them (it only takes about 10 minutes). It's sort of like the boa constrictor with the elephant inside, from The Little Prince. Many people think it's a hat. Of course, some of us will understand."
3,Number One on My Bucket List,"My 2nd grade teacher assigned her class to read this book back in 1957. I failed to do so. ""210 pages for a 2nd grader? Give me a break!""I found a copy in good condition through Amazon.com and completed my over-due reading assignment. Item number one on my bucket list can now be checked off."
3,Just Gus,This was a nice read but was disappointed it was not more story than pictures. Too high a price for no more story.
3,Just Gus,"I expected this book to be more about the relationship between Gus and the women he loved, and in reality it is, however much of that relationship is told through photos rather than words. It is often said 'a photo speaks 1000 words' and that is very true, but i personally was slightly disappointed with the lack of story. This is no fault of the book itself, more my expectation of it. Gus is a truly lovely and lucky dog. A nice, but not taxing, read."
4,Easy reading that will grab your heart,"This writing is not particularly deep and was not meant to be, but it will touch you deeply. I loved it! It sits on my coffee table and I have had to wait for guests to finish before we can leave."
5,Response to firewomann review,"""Just Gus"" is the book that made Howard Stern cry. He also followed up on this comment by interviewing the author on his show."
3,I was expecting more of a story.,"I was disappointed in this book in that it is very short. Considering the time left for this lady at the time she acquired Gus, I guess there could only be so much story there. The relationship appears to have been rewarding for her, and it is wonderful that she had Gus for her remaining lifetime. Overall the story was just a little superficial and I don't believe it came close to conveying the depth of the relationship that probably existed between Gus and his owner."
3,College paper,I wanted to get a better handle on castle architecture and this is.... It reads like a doctoral thesis and includes material on ancient and midieval castles but nothing in depth. My bad... I forgot to read the blurb at the bottom of the page.
2,No wonder it's forgotten...,"Listening to this album, you'll get a clear idea why this band wa buried forever in ""underground"". It's a pedestrian, generic and hardly innovative metal band. None, absolutely none of the songs are memorable.Their only quality is their leader, Burke Shelley, who really has a great voice."
2,Most of the time it's average rock without a thrill,"The rockers on the album is nothing special but of rather mediocre or average standard. The real highlight are the slower acoustic ""Rolling home again"" and ""Make me happy"", and especially ""Rolling home again"" is good, very good!"
2,An average performance by Piero Piccioni,"This CD has the merit of covering all of the movie's songs, including several versions of one same tune, which is always a good thing. Whether one likes or dislikes the music is a question of taste. I don't think this is Piccioni at his best, but some late '60s ""groovy"" music fans will no doubt enjoy this."
2,A pale imitation of Paulos,"I read this book a few years ago. The book is little more than a pale imitation of John Allen Paulos' highly successful ""Innumeracy"" series. I decided to review this book now because I recently read another book, ""Debunking 9/11 Myths,"" in which Dewdney's name came up. Apparently Dewdney has spent most of his spare time over the last few years peddling ridiculous 9/11 ""Reichstag Fire"" type conspiracy theories. I strongly recommend that you read John Allen Paulos' ""Innumeracy"" or anything by Martin Gardner instead of Dewdney, who has degenerated into a crank of the highest magnitude."
4,200% of Nothing....by A.K. Dewdney,"Truly an eye-opening book, pointing out many often overlooked flaws and abuses in the use of mathematics to sell a product or advance a political agenda. Should be required reading in any consumer education course."
3,"Stick to the subject, leave the soapbox alone","A very amusing fast read. Having worked with the media and the general public regarding statistics, I found myself nodding and smiling often at the examples presented. However, the last chapter really detracted from the overall flow of the book. The tone changes. Dewdney gets on a soapbox, telling everyone how the world can't live without more mathmaticians. Puh-lease!"
1,Kindle Version a Disappointment,"I bought this book for my Kindle because of the $2.99 price and I wanted to learn more about the Ancient Near East. The book is less of a history than an archeological account. The original book was published in 1929. Though the book is quite dated, it would still be of interest as a time capsule of archeology. It must be said, however, that the Kindle version -- which does not have the original illustrations or maps -- is a waste of money and time.I would be interested in reading the original publication with the illustrations. I cannot recommend the Kindle version."
2,THE DVD and Elizabeth Taylor,"Of course, this early Elizabeth Taylor movie is good and also the Cast. So I give them 5 Stars.Picture quality is not bad at all but not perfect.But please Warner Bros. The DVD and specially the Grand Dame Elizabeth Taylor deservs a much better DVD release with chapter menus, restoration etc, and SUBTITLES FOR DEAF HEARING PEOPLE."
4,nice fixture but be careful,"very nice quality but if you are a first time DIYer like me, make sure you pay attention to the color coded hot/cold valves. instructions do not mention the color coding and they can be installed backwards. easy fix but a bit of a pain to remove and re-install."
5,Hattie Marshall and the Dangerous Fire,I liked the book because Hattie is sort of like me because she goes through problems everyday like I go through.I have a brother named Sam and Hattie has a brother named Sam.Hattie is also involved in adventure and mystery and I like that too.
2,Chilton's Honda Civic and Del Sol 1996-00 Repair Manual,"Adequate for simple repairs and a general understanding of the cars covered, Chilton manuals are a cheap alternative to buying the ""real"" shop manual. Unfortunately, for whatever the reason, they are fraught with errors and omissions. Wiring diagrams may not be correct, and often simple step by step instructions are unclear. I have had Chilton's manuals for several of the many cars that I have owned and I often swear at them more than I swear by them."
2,Could be a lot better,Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Honda Factory Service Manual. The instructions are vague and the pictures are wildly unhelpful and ambiguous.
2,very frustrating,"Disappointed with this & all Chilton car books. If you are a complete beginner , the explanations & pictures are not clear enough to make you feel comfortable.The descriptions are not clear & there is a need for a lot more & a lot clearer batch of pictures.They may work for you if you have some car knowledge but take time to read through them before you buy.I do not feel that I got my monies worth & wish that I had looked at other options."
5,Helpful Information,This book has saved me $$$ many times. Although it is not in depth as a Factory service manual. It is money well spent!
2,From a book worm's perspective,"I thought this book was not written in an exciting or enticing manner. I felt the author lacked passion and maybe even her interest while writing.I'm a big fan of The Rolling Stones and only read this book out of boredom rather than interest.The author fails.She shows some photos of herself, though none at all of her WITH Brian Jones.(except for her at the house and near The Pool.)I didn't find her book convincing. It seems as though she wasn't With Brian Jones much at all, except for his tragic and mysterious death.Since her story is written so blurred and passionless, I wonder how much passion she had for him. That was about the only subject that aroused my curiosity.I notice she's written another book also about Brian Jones.I'm not buying that, Anna."
4,A Must!,"Ms Wohlin has apparently had battles with lawyers over the publication of this book and I think one has to read between the lines to find the truth. She has told as much as she was allowed to with regard to Brian Jones death and it is all there if you can but see it. I found it a fascinating insight into the last few months of Brian Jones life. Not the wasted, washed up, lost soul that the Rolling Stones would have liked you to think but a newly regenerated force to be reckoned with, had he lived long enough to start a new band. Great book, well done Anna for having the guts to write it."
2,Good Idea... Poor Quality,"My son received this for his birthday and was very excited. It is a great idea and he enjoyed playing with it, BUT ... after a few hours of throwing the LAX ball at the targets it started getting holes in the tarp. The original target had a line of the laminate come off the tarp when we unfolded it from the box, so we sent one back. The second target had similar problems, although not as severe, when we unfolded it from the box."
5,So far so good,"I bought these due to the high number of positive reviews, and all I can say is that after about 10 burned, no problems."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased a 50-pack of Verbatim single-layer DVD+R discs not long ago, and while I have a high opinion of their product overall, I ended up with fourteen failed burns out of the fifty. I contacted them via email about this and never did receive a response. So while I will continue to invest in their dual-layer product, I now shop elsewhere for single-layer discs. Evidently no manufacturer is perfect, not even Verbatim."
1,Waste of Money,Many of rhem don't work.I can't fromat them.A waste of money. I would not order them again. I have not had this problem before.
5,Verbatim DVD+R Discs,"I purchased these after having a terrible experience with another brand (Sony). The other brand took forever to create part of a backup set, only to fail the consistency checks at the end for several disks. I took back the Sony discs and researched the user experiences on Amazon. The Verbatim discs worked quickly and flawlessly during the backup process."
4,Seem to be OK,"I needed a bunch of DVDs to create a system image, so I ordered these. I've used 6 of them so far, and one was bad. That's probably about average."
4,Fast and flawless,"The lot I received had no visible imperfections. Compared to the old batch (4x) I had been using, these are much faster to write, which is a nice upgrade. Verbatum remains a reliable brand for me.I always update reviews if the situation changes. If I have any problems, I will update this review.Four stars means ""I like it"". I reserve five stars for products that exceed expectations. These work fine and live up to my expectations, but do not exceed them."
1,would not write,"Product would not write/produced write error with my PC and several others. Compatibility should have been fine as other DVDs burn fine. I may have gotten a bad batch.Of note, if you buy try them out quickly as the return window is limited."
2,Kinda disappointed,"Thought I was getting a good deal when I purchased Verbatim DVDs, and for the first 10-15 DVD burn jobs it was a great deal.. But the last 8-10 burn jobs only ended up only being partial burnings smh... Which means the whole movie didn't burn leaving me with a useless DVD! I've used Verbatim in the past, and really didn't have this problem before, and for now will have to find a more reliable brand until the problems fixed..."
5,Life Saver!!!,"I was at a loss as to where to find the third season of Army Wives, all the stores had season 2 and season 4, but none had 3. Thank God I found it on Amazon as it was a much wanted Christmas gift for my daughter!!"
5,Armey Wives Season 3,"I purchased this for a christmas prestent, my daughter requested it she likes the show, I am a truck driver and dont get to watch TV anymore :( but my daughter enjoys the show Delievery was fast."
5,Army Wives - Season Three,"This season is excellent. I enjoy every new season more than the previous one. Characters, story lines, actors - perfect combination for a great series."
4,Really enjoyed!,What can I say? Looking forward to starting on season 4. Easy to get hooked on the stories that unfold in each episode.
1,save your money,"For variety, it'd be nice to have a pretty lady to lead the exercises. This isn't the DVD for that. The cover says she's a teacher, but inside it says this is not for instruction -- fact is, she's not a teacher, and she seems to be doing each thing for the first time, and she keeps whispering and looking to someone off camera to tell her what to do. The camera work and setting are poor. Also, I really don't care for rings in the lips, arm hair, or tattoos. Save your money and don't buy this . DVD. I think the three favorable reviews had to be associated with the production company -- they can't be implying straight faced that this has to do with teaching yoga, or even doing it well."
1,"No Teacher, No instruction","Yes, the fake reviews here are from a person associated with this one trick pony. Why call it Yoga Teacher when there is no teacher and no instruction. Just one pierced stripper faking yoga. There are actual Nude Yoga instructional dvd's sold here with lovely ladies. This one defeats the purpose."
5,betty boop towel set,i really like the towel set. it is a wonderful addition to my collection of betty boop items and serves as a pretty decoration in my bathroom.
4,Good value for money,"First, disadvantages:- too few maps and those available are with a small scale, so one can get only a rough idea about the changes on the word and especially European political maps within the century;- the timeline doesn't contain the exact dates wherever it is possible (months, at best).Meanwhile, all in all, due to the brilliant and concise annotation it is worth keeping for reference even by advanced students of this period. I also consider it good value for money"

4,Hayley Westenra - songbird,"Hayley Westenra is a lovely singer with a clear beautiful voice. I enjoy the music in this selection. I learned of her by chance looking for the song, ""Pie Jesu"" and became enchanted with her rendition of it on YouTube. I searched an album with her singing that song and found this one. The only disappointments I have are that some of the songs are sung too quickly for my taste and the price was a little high. Otherwise she has a pure true voice. I heartily recommend her album."
4,Not as good as I hoped,"Hayley Westenra is my favorite musician, but this is my least favorite of her CDs. I still listen to it quite regularly and recommend it but not if it's your first CD by Hayley Westenra."
3,Nice frist Cd from a great young singer,This is a nice frist Cd from her. But pure is better. The songs on Prue for the most part are better but she does do a very good I dreamed a dream and there are other songs that she did a very good job with.
3,BFarron,"Not nearly a Charlotte Church;lacks the power and note-holding ability. Would compare more to Enya, but without the haunting capability."
5,"Darker and heavier than ""Demanufacture""","This cd's Fear Factory death-indust metal side.The song's lyrics are depressing and the music was dark,but very awesome.The synthesizer sounds are gloomy,and sometimes scary,but impressive.Guitar riffs are good,drums not bad,in a few songs too simple,but it isn't a big dissapointing thing.The vocals are heavy...Burton's not a Corpsegrinder (Cannibal Corpse) but he's voices are good,and the singing is very clean.My 3 favourite songs int this cd : Crisis,Big God-raped souls,and Self Immolation .""Soul of a New Machine"" isn't an other ""Demanufacture"",but talented and original album."
5,Great album...true metal..almost melodic? ;),"I had never seen nor heard of Fear factory until i saw them playing a four-band bill (with Sepultura, Clutch and Fudge Tunnel), and when they took the stage I was like huh? Then they unleasehd one of the best live sets I've ever heard. The next moring with a stiff neck and an abundance of moshpit bruises, i hustled over to tower Records and bought this album...wow...""Martyr"" remains one of my favorite songs today...That whole ""Got to get away"" growl sticks in my head for weeks after listening to it...Buy this album then buy all of the FF albums..then check out their killer website."
1,I would rate it zero if I could,"Do not buy this album if you like harmony and music. This is not music, it is noise and screaming. The lead ""singer"" screams so loud you cannot understand what he is saying. Do not buy this album."
5,Back when Fear Factory were still awesome...,"God, FF used to be so friggin' good. Now, they are not horrible now, but their first few releases were so much stronger than all that they are releasing now. I got this cd after purchasing Demanufacture (another superb metal album) and was blown away by the level of heaviness this cd achieves. This cd came out in the era where FF were still just a heavy-as-hell death metal band, and hadn't really explored the industrial/melodic DM they are now. I would highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes death metal. Note: Burton's vocal style on this release is even more DM than any other, and sort of sounds like a heavier Johan Liiva (formerly of Arch Enemy),or Glen Benton from Deicide (though burton is far more easily understood) Recommended also to fans of Cannibal Corpse/SIx Feet Under and similar bands. Buy with confidence, its a great cd."
2,so-so much better alblums came for fear factory,It's just not as good as newer releases like demanufactured and obsolete.ff is one of my favorite bands their has devloped into one of the most cutting edge newmetal sounds around
4,Foundations of Fear Factory,"This CD release set the foundations of Fear Factory and in later albums they built from. In this album the band struggles between the metal sounding of 'Concrete' and their future direction of Industrial Metal. The songs that stand out are in the first 8 tracks and they are; Leechmaster, Crisis, Lifeblind and Flesh Hold.I wasn't really keen on the others however Self Immolation sounded pretty good. (see the remixed version of the song - even better)"
4,A good C.D? YES! Their best C.D? NO.,"Fear Factory is a great band, one of the best in fact. If you own any other of their alblums such as ""Demanufacture"", then this is not what you are used to. Instead of sounding like Fear Factory, they sound more like Cannibal Corpse, just not as disgusting. It's still a good C.D. with many good songs like ""Martyr"" & ""Scapegoat"". It just lacks their musical genius in a few of their songs. If I could, I would give 4 1/2 stars."
4,"Great product, less than perfect reception","Great item, but very poor reception in certain areas. I use it while running outdoors, and I have had absolutely no service for 30 minutes at a time, at times. I am hoping that the antenna headphones will improve the reception. Other than that, I love it."
3,weak signal,"Without the special headphones w/antenna the reception horrible. I am familiar with other xm-to-go products, and understand needing a clear line of sight. I guess I assumed that the internal antenna would bestronger than it was, or just did not think about the user's body blocking signals. Other than that and now that I have the headphones w/antenna on headset all is well."
2,Does not work in Buildings,"I am currently sitting in the Auburn University library, right next to a window, watching this thing tell me ""No Signal"". It received no signal in my apartment either, unless you attach the antenna. It receives an in and out signal outside, and in a moving car. If your car is stationary the signal remains strong. If you hold the unit in your hand, or next to your person (Belt Clip\Arm Band) you will not receive a signal. This item does not function properly as a portable ""On the Go"" device."
1,Marginal service - crappy support,"I've been using my Helix for over 2 years now. Biggest complaints:1) The reception has NEVER been good on this radio2) After giving up on decent radio reception, I decided to use it as an mp3/podcast player. That probably would have been ok, except that over the years as Napster has changed it's program, XM has done little or nothing (mostly nothing) to coordinate with Napster on the Helix/Napster interface. You can no longer use Napster to manage songlists. Napster has been as helpful as it can in suggesting work-arounds, but one technician finally told me that XM has done nothing to update its drivers in the Helix. I'm not technically proficient enough to know if that's the case or not, but that's what I've been told. I do know that if I had to do it all over again, I would NOT have bought this product."
1,Terrible warranty service from Samsung,"When the radio works it is good (except for frequent loss of signal when walking with it in standalone mode, ie, no external antenna), but pray you never have a warranty problem. My radio died, Samsung has had it for almost 6 weeks now and I can't find out from them when it will be returned. And I've called every number I can find!!! Meantime I keep paying my XM service. I would recommend you buy local from some place that will honor the warranty IN HOUSE!!!!"
3,"Not quite ""CD quality""","I have listened to this for almost 3 months now and find the sound quality to be only acceptable. Even in the relatively open SW (eg: no tall buildings or trees) where I live there is quite a bit of static, more like AM or FM radio rather than satellite quality. To be honest, I'm rather surprised as other satellite broadcasting I've used is really superior to their over-the-air counterparts."
1,Don't be fooled by the hype!,"This product (as with the Pioneer Inno) was intentionally downgraded, so that the FM transmitter will only work if you buy the car kit. Now you can't take it to your office and use with your boombox, etc. Perhaps they think they will sell more hardware this way.However, in the days of advancing electronics we should expect better. Don't buy this product until they change it back! Don't worry, a competitor will soon improve on this situation!"
1,Beware of the short battery life and poor warranty support,"I'm on my second unit and am still experiencing the same problem. On a full charge, I will power the unit off and leave it off for a couple of days. Two days later, the battery is completely dead. The problem is that if you travel much, don't go far without a charger. According to the people I spoke with at Samsung, this should not be the case. They replaced it after 6 months of bad service from their outsourced service company (CVE) in New Jersey. (Instead of dealing with the battey issue, they just reformmated the unit!) I got this product on Father's Day of 2006 and as of Nov 24, I have been able to use it for about 20 hours without problems!"
4,Good XM radio,"I use my XM2go radio mostly in a fixed location with the antenna pointing south for good reception. My main goal is recording old music. I like that the radio can record a song as long as it is playing; it will not pick up the beginning of a song if the song is already playing when accessed.Converting the captured songs for play on a computer is not an option, however, playing the captured song from the headset jack into a line input jack works, which must be captured. The quality is good. The line volume might need adjusting coming out of the radio, an option is provided for line output level from the menu."
4,Very pleased,"The Helix has surprised me. The home kit fits perfect in my car and uses the same power adapter and antennae as my XM sportscaster. The radio works fine outside as long as you hold it. In the carry case it will lose signal if you turn away from the south. The XM antennae head phones will probably solve that problem.The memory has only two settings. 100% XM or 50/50. You can not partition for 100% MP3.The radio actually picks up a strong signal in my living room with no external antennae attached.So the cradle stays in the auto connected up. Nice:) When I'm out of the car I just bring it in, connect it to the AC power supply it comes with and connect it to my amp using the headphone jack. Works great. The record feature is very slick.It appears to be very well made. Nice fit and finish. Screen is big and clear. It rotates if it's in the cradle. Nice feature."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I was so excited for this unit, only to find that it wasn't the quality I expected.First, the FM transmitter only works in the Car Dock (not included) so if you want to use it at home, make sure your stereo has audio jacks or an aux jack.Second, the product was defective. My songs on the MP3 repeat sometimes and the headphone jack is faulty causing the sound to cut out and sound bad unless you hold the cord into the unit. This happens with both the MP3 and the XM sat radio - so I know it isn't reception.Samsung offered to repare it but the tech support is awful and unknowledgable. We'll see what happens."
1,Only Because Zero Stars Isn't An Option.,Mobile radio reception is horrible. Totally incompatible with Mac and iTunes. Record function is spotty at best.
3,"Part of the standard bio set, but not the best read","Because this is considered an important piece of work about a figure with whom I have long been fascinated, I chose to slog my way through. However, I much prefer the biography written by Alison Weir. It is a smoother, better written piece of work that captures more of the excitement that is the life of Eleanor. On another note, the map in this edition is appalling! It wasn't even readable. I had to dig out a good historical atlas to make sense of it. Since Eleanor's story is one that covers a lot of ground, this is an important point. Should be updated in future editions."
3,"Good history, tough read","I did a research project into the Early Plantagent Period of History, and this was one of my sources. Although Amy Ruth Kelly has a lot of insight and an interesting tale to tell in this carefully researched and historically acurate book, she tells her story in an obtuse and overly unclear way. This is a very tough read as the prose is archaic and intricate, but the story of Eleanor is absolutly fascinating."
4,good book,"This book is more of a history of the life and times of Eleanor than a traditional biography. Or if it is a biography, its a bio of its literal title (Eleanor AND the four kings). The French Carpet kings and Henry of England both are well covered as are her children. The research is good. The book is well structured covering subjects directly related to Eleanor and subjects that are not so directly related. Its well sourced and is willing to admit that there are things we don't know.The writing style is a bit ""flowery"" on occasion. And the author seems sometimes to get swept up in the romance of the era on occasion. Most of the time its ok. The only chapter where it became a problem was the chapter on her so-called ""Court of Love"" at Poitiers.But all-in-all, its a good history of Eleanor's life, the second crusade, the rise of Henry II's empire and its eventual decline & fall."
3,Rob,"This is undoubtedly a well researched and detailed account of a truly fascinating epoch in European history. But be forewarned, this book is not easy to read. Although published in the middle of the twentieth century, it could almost surely pass as a product of a much earlier time, say the fifteenth or sixteenth century. The prose style is highly pretentious and the vocabulary and phraseology are self-consciously archaic. While some readers may find this charming, others, including myself, find it more than a bit annoying. One can imagine the author being so steeped in ancient texts that she is unable to render their contents in a modern style to a contemporary audience. I consider myself a relatively intelligent and serious reader, but I found ""Eleanor"" to be a genuine chore to finish."
3,Great history of the time but not much on Eleanor.,"I agree with the other reviews that this is dated in terms of style and verbosity. While it seems well researched, it errs in giving too much information about other key figures of the times and very little in parts about Eleanor. I was disappointed not to know what she was doing during vast and important parts of the story."
2,Point to Point Navigation,I do believe that Vidal was a smart and clever writer. However I was overwhelmed by his narcissism.Glad it's over with.
2,Gore Vidal Point to Point Navigation. This should be titled Ramblings of an Old Man.,This book was not an easy read and I have read many of his works. He didn't flow with one thought but flitted through many and lost track of the original thought many times. It was a name dropping fiesta for the most part and a disappointment.
2,Why So Hate-filled?,"While Mr. Vidal has a way with words, those words apparently spring from a poisoned soul. From his conspiracy theories to his hatred of all things that smack of conservatism, patriotism and Christianity, he comes off like a sad, bitter old man. What a damaged individual."
3,Read with caution,"Readers are well advised to not take anything for granted with this work, as with any work written by an outsider about another culture. Courlander did not live with the people, in fact much of what is contained in this volume are the writings of others about the various cultures. So, it's not entirely his work, but the work of others that he's compiled. Because of the wide net cast by Courlander and the absolute inability to be intimately aware of all of the nuances of the language and culture of all of these peoples, there are some blatant inaccuracies in the information compiled within this volume."
5,"Treasury, Indeed!","A Treasury of Afro-American Folklore: The Oral Literature, Traditions, Recollections, Legends, Tales, Songs, Religious Beliefs, Customs, Sayings and Humor of Peoples of African American Descent in the Americasby Harold Courlanderis is a much loved, often used book and cited text in my personal library--it is bound to be the same for anyone interesed in African American folklore. This book is encyclopedic in scope yet it is also very rich, diverse and deep. Contains the stories of Africans in all points of the Americas, even countries where African presence and contribution has been largely overlooked. This is an essential text for the student of African American history, folklore or arts. Highly recommended!"
3,Middle of the Raod Barzun,"Before reading this book, I loved Darwin, disliked Marx and hated Wagner (how could you not!). After this book, nothings changed except that I actually found myself defending all three against Barzun's onslaught.This book can read two ways. First as a biographical synopsis of the three writers and their cultural backdrop, and second, as an outdated diatribe. The reader should ignore Barzun's polemic (?) and read it as a history. This, of course, is Barzun's strength and he does not fail to meet high expectations.The polemic is of course outdated. The whine over materialism taking the magic and mystery out of life has been rehashed too many times. He is especially hard on Darwin, who he seems to think can be blamed for Herbert Spencer.Read the book anyway. Not only is the writing superb, the point of view is interesting and if anything it will challenge you. Though not an easy one, it's terser than most authors could do given the subjects."
3,Dry Bubble Level,Received the antenna without any problems other than the bubble level for the mast was bone dry. I sent an email to the supplier and asked for them to send me a new bubble level and I never heard a word from them at all. Additionally I have not received any information from Amazon regarding this issue either.
1,defective,Item received with no visible damage. When installed no signal whatsoever from any of the 4 outputs.Was this on sale because it was defective merchandise?
3,Does the job,"Its a decent no thrills dish, and for the price its a decent deal. It works with just about any type of dish plan you could imagine."
1,Damaged goods,The DX antenna was very poorly packed and was damaged when recieved. The Antenna itself is unusable.
3,Bad Rap?,"This novel is an anomaly in James's canon - a mid period piece which completely lacks the ""Sinister Undercurrent."" It is a comedy, everything works out fine in the end, and the characters dissipate in the air a few weeks after you've read it. However, if you are a grad student looking to knock out another thesis on the transatlantic theme in Henry James, this one is a must read. Near the bottom of the list for me as far as James goes, but I liked it better than ""The Europeans."" Read it for curiosity's sake: how often does everything work out happily in a James novel?"
4,indisensable if you go beyond just most classical greek,"handy relevé on the subject which allows us to understand the ancient greek language much deeply, the book is infested with too many typos which are annoying for supposed readers who normally encounters cited dialectal words for the first time in this book. the book has a table of errata which, as my impression goes, would correct only half of the errors, and itself has some typos... this important flaw rips one star, unfortunately.i recommend to associate to this book the Morphologie historique du grec (isbn 2252033975) by P. Chantraine. this book explains the attic&homeric; morphology with method of comparative linguistics, citing forms from indoeuropean languages but also from dialectal greeks including the mycenean."
2,Mostly Empty,"Light on content and substance, this book is mostly a compiled bibliography. It's as if the intent was ""If you want something interesting to read, go read this other book."" Topics are not treated with much depth and more could be gained with a few hours surfing the internet."
4,Took me on a power trip,"I just recieved this album today and I'm pumped to hear it. Overall, it seems to me like the band took a new approach to the musical aspect of their songs. The tracks here seem more progressive but still good nonetheless. Now the musicanship is above average. In fact, I thought it would be bad but im really glad I got this album. The vocals do sound like Chuck Billy, but around this time, thrash was pushed to its limits so everyone sorta sounded like everyone else. Overall, this is a good album, not a thrash masterpiece but a good solid progressive thrash album. I really wish I could have heard this band a lot sooner than I did. Good buy for anyone who loves thrash."
4,Holmes Half Achieved,"In his novelette named The Golden Fortress Ray makes an admirable effort to make Feluda reach the deductive heights previously reached only by his much-liked Sherlock Holmes, albeit in a much more light milieu and non-professional manner. The effort does not go in vain altogether as the book turns out to be an interesting spend of free time. The end is somewhat unexpected too. Indeed, I could go on to say that if you give Holmes 10 on a scale of ten, then you're bound to give this story a 7.5.Good enough, eh?"
3,sellers fault its a flop I think....,I think it is the sellers fault I feel this product is a flop. beautiful perfumes was the seller when I ordered. The perfume was OLD and the bath beads were like a deflated soccer ball old and wrinkly. The perfume kinda smelled like baby soft but not really HAD to be OLD.
2,Too Trashy,"Though I thought the book was certainly funny at times, I just did not find the characters really likeable. I also like a relationship based on love and caring not a bunch of casual sex. She is established as a goody goody and him as a casual cowboy. There is quite a bit of oral sex (from him and her), which doesn't bother me it was just the casualness of it, there was no talk of any type of lasting relationship pretty much assumed by both as a fling(until the very end)."
2,Crazy. Absolutely crazy.,"(...) This book is an adventure story about a guy who has a gun and a whole buttload of pigpeople to kill. Zoom! Boom! Bazoom! That's what I think his shotgun sounded like as he unloaded it into those foul creatures! It's crazy, I tell you!Then he goes into space right? To the GREEN SUN. Obviously a play on the Loc-Nar from the movie Heavy Metal. What a load. William H. Hodgeson obviously travelled into the future to copy it. Or maybe the Grimaldi guy went back in time and showed him the story boards. I don't know. But it's crazy, I tell you! (...)"
3,It's worth reading...it's short,"This book was very promising at the outset. It was a masterpiece in the making but the author never followed through. The plot took a very unrelated twist and the thrill of the old house was lost in the bizarre pursuit of the theory of the end of the world. All that was set up at the beginning was never returned to, and I was very disappointed at the non-ending. I did however generally enjoy the book and would recommend it because it is short, and reads fast."
3,This graphic novel takes some nasty liberties with the original book,"The first time I checked out the graphic novel adaptation of William Hope Hodgson's THE HOUSE ON THE BORDERLAND, I was repulsed by what happened to the only female character. I checked it out again because I was reading the original and wanted to compare the two.Parts of this graphic novel are definitely taken from the original. However, what repulsed me in Messrs. Corben and Revelstroke's version isn't. I really wish that they hadn't combined the two female characters in the novel into one woman and then given her such sadistic treatment.That said, the framing sequence here is much more horrifying than in the book. I think it's quite the best part of the comic -- and that Mr. Hodgson's nameless recluse might prefer this fate.If you hate women, you will love what happens to Mary."
5,The House on the Borderland,"I love creepy and this fits the bill. I have not read all of it, but so far really good."
2,I did not like it.,"First half was fairly ok.. Then on it was dull reading. It has tried to package too much of time travel, testing one's patience."
3,"Great story, poorly rendered","I've been a Carnacki fan for decades, so any W. H. Hodgson work is of interest. This is a wonderful 'house that's not quite right' story, that would easily have earned five stars were it not for the typographical errors in the etext; primarily ridiculous overuse of commas, which this reader found distracting."
4,starts out great and fizzles,"I give the book 6 stars starting out then it gets a bit spacey, Its a good read, dont miss this one."
3,The Roots of Horror,"Lovecraft spoke highly of Hodgeson, as did Smith. This particular book definitely fits into the genre of weird. The reason that I gave it only three stars is that I have read or seen these ideas before. However, the reason it gets as many stars as it does is that this is most likely the source of all those other texts and films. Many of the concepts that horror writers and film makers use seem to appear in this book, though long before they became so easily recognizable. I imagine someone reading this volume without having had the benefit of years of horror films and books to desensitize one to the concepts introduced, and I imagine that this book freaked the holy bejeezus out of him. Don't break the bank to get it, but if you're interested in turn of the century horror this will be one you won't want to miss."
3,Unsatisfying,"This was a fairly entertaining book, but it left me unsatisfied, since it was primarily concerned with emotional effects, to the detriment of plot and fleshed out ideas. It was similar to Lovecraft, with a little Stapledon mixed in, but not quite as good as either. Also, the character of the sister was a major problem. It was hard to believe that someone could be so oblivious to these bizarre events, or that her brother could be so oblivious to her. But I can see how this book had a big influence on later science fiction and horror writers"
2,Dull,"People make a point of the grand sweep of the cosmic, but I just thought that ended up dull. Cosmically dull is not a good outcome."
2,"okay, but not THAT good","it's alright, but a little hokey and dated, and i don't know what book most of the other reviewers on this page read. two young men find a manuscript in the ruins of a castle about a guy shooting white pigs out his window. wow. talk about ""cosmic dread"" and ""icy terror"". there was nothing spectacular or even slightly memorable about this book, except the beginning. the reason everyone gives such verbose praise to this thoroughly forgettable, antiquated novel is that lovecraft said a few good words about it. but let's remember our friendly neighborhood sheep, he was a man of his times, and i seriously doubt that if he was alive he would have such lavish praise for this novel now. lovecraft's material dated well (except for the racism), so did blackwood's (aside from the pantheism), so did lefanu and bierce's:hodgson's most certainly did not. skip it and read something by arthur machen or thomas ligotti."
3,Not easily forgotten,"This is a story that will stay with you long after finishing it. Although I did find it a bit frustrating, as most questions asked never seem to be answered (Such as what do the swine-like creatures signify?),maybe Hodgson never meant for us to know the answers.For me, the most memorable part of the story is during the main character's ""journey"" in which he travels billions of years into the future to encounter the death of the solar system. Here one cannot help but feel the utter lonliness of being the last human on a dying Earth.I would not categorize this book as one of the horror genre. It was never truly ""scary"". Fantasy/Science Fiction would be more appropriate. I am truly glad to have experienced this story and would highly recommend it."
3,revew of house on the borderland,"it was a book of a specific genre - in the lovecraft school and well written. it had a dated feel because of the language but it was also free and useful background for those who like modern books of this genre. finally, the price was right and it did well in keeping me amused while traveling."
5,Stephen King Lovers TAKE NOTE,"The great granddaddy of horror classics, The House On The Borderland won't fail to scare the goosebumps off you. From age 13 to 113, readers will be uniformly chilled by Hodgeson. While the book was written before World War I, the concepts seem contemporary as Hodgeson takes fear of the unknown, and the dark, into ventures into time and space. Truly a forgotten masterpiece, this work influenced H.P. Lovecraft."
4,A truly haunting tale.,"House on the Borderland is a must-read for those who appreciate the atmosphere Lovecraft created in many of his tales, such as The Lurking Fear. The swine-things in the subterranean pit are the most frightening thing I have ever read. The story does drag a bit toward the middle-end, as our protagonist is travelling across time."
3,Overwrought but interesting,"This story is quite reminiscent of Arthur Machen's work, with a similar feeling of weird alienation. It's not as well done as Machen, I think, because Hodgson's style is one of piling on the creepy events with little coherence to the whole. But there are memorable images, and the overall effect is quite unsettling if you take it seriously."
2,Only partially true to the original,"The original story was one of wonder and terror. This version is mostly wonder, where the good stuff from the novel went. Where is the arena, or the silent and unmoving gods, or the end of the universe? This is only the monster story of the attack of the swine things. Yeah, the swine things are important, but they are NOT the most important part of this wonderful short novel. Unless you are a real comics fanatic, or hate the writing of Hodgson, don't bother with this rip off. It's okay for what it does, but compared to the original novel, this is a couple of mentally retarded children drawing scary pictures."
4,Fascinating but disjointed weird novel,"As someone who really likes turn-of-the-century horror writers like Arthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood, this book sounded like something right up my alley. Like a number of other reviewers, I thought the beginning chapters dealing with the pit and its creatures were terrific (in the true sense of the word), but the author lost me somewhat in the very long cosmological journeys through space-time that make up the middle of the book. It almost seemed like two novels--one that I really wanted to read, and one that I had to wade through to get back to the one I wanted to be reading. Unfortunately, the latter interfered with the experience of the former.I'd still recommend it as a quirky and interesting--if ultimately a little disappointing--read for people who like the gothic fiction of this period. Some of it reminded me of H. G. Wells at his best, and I would definitely give other stories by this author a try."
2,Not great,"One dish - AFTER you use 3 more dishes to pre-cook the noodles or rice, the chicken or beef, make the sauce, sautee the vegetables, or boil the cabbage/spinach. Cooking times are often way off (I just cooked a dish that had a 40-minute cooking time and the chicken is quite raw), and measurements are ambiguous, e.g., one package of spinach. Fresh or frozen? size? Some places, steps are left out, and no indication whether to cook covered or uncovered. And if you don't like artichoke hearts, a good portion of the recipes will be ruled out for you. Really disappointing."
2,mind over matter,Disappointed with the book. It gave examples of mind over matter in history but no real tangible way how to master it. Too much of the author going off into tangents. Did not like the book at all.
4,previous reviewer in error-missing songs from original release,"While this is still a good album, it is not a cd version of the original album There are songs missing & added to this version-in particular jet boy/jet girl is NOT here as mentioned below."
1,one hit wonder,I purchased this cd for $4 on ebay and think it was a waste of $4. Nitty has a hit in nasty girl and a decent song with abc but fails to produce another decent song. i would not recomend this cd.
4,Gentle humor on choosing to be childless,"I thought this was a funny book, and refreshingly without the acerbic tone of some books on this topic. I loved the illustrations and found them a perfect complement to the narrative."
1,"For me, this book was not funny","My husband and I didn't think that this book was funny. At all. Not good for a book which is designed entirely to be a comedy. So it is now at a thrift store somewhere.Everyone has a different sense of humor, so I'm not saying that this book isn't funny, just that I didn't find it funny. Oh well."
2,Nothing Insightful,"This book was a disappointment. The extremely light read was a bland description of the utterly obvious. Nothing insightful, helpful or of quality can be found to counter the ""Pro - creation"" attitude in America. If you are looking for a read that will occupy time in a waiting room you found it, however if you are looking for insightful thought on the childless revolution this is not your book."
3,I was disappointed...,"I was hoping for an intelligent humor book about being CF. What I got was essentially a paperback coloring book. Lots of HUGE fonts, bad jokes and even worse illustrations. I was not happy with this book at all. If the jokes had at least been funny I probably would've given a better review, but they're not. I can't remember even cracking a smile once."
2,A bit of a letdown,"I didn't find this book very humorous, and definitely not very substantial. It is an easy read - the typing is large and there are only 70-something pages. The book makes a few humorous points about the joys of being childfree, but is an overall letdown and left me thinking, ""Is that it??"" If you're looking for something that will keep you laughing, read Adrianne Frost's ""I Hate Other People's Kids."""
2,Not that funny...,"This was not NEARLY as funny as I was expecting. Baby Not on Board is a much more entertaining read. The artwork is not that great, either. I wouldn't recommend this. I give it 2 stars because there are some good ones in the book, but not too many. Save your cash."
3,Strips or chunks,"My definition of strips is different than theirs. these pieces are square or rectangular. Strips to me are long and narrow. The leather is fine, just not what I had planned on. I'd call them chunks before I'd use the term strips"
4,Snugglers Dog,"I bought this as a X-mas present for my 8 year old daughter and she loved it. The best part is that since it does not come stuffed, you get to buy the type of pillow you want separately to stuff it with."
3,snugglers,"This is a very cute toy and my kids were so excited to get them, but they are made out of slippery nylon, so they aren't soft at all, and not, in my daughter's opinion, ""snuggly""!"
5,Great introduction to heavy-duty truck systems,"This book, along with Ian Andrew Norman's book, gives a fantastic introduction to the world of heavy-duty trucks. If you are diesel technician student, or a journeyman mechanic, this book is definitely for you."
2,Difficult to use.,"This filter worked well when it worked. You need a separate power head to run the Lifeguard. I had great difficulty getting the Lifeguard going again everytime I cleaned the power head and hooked it back up. I ended up getting rid of it - too much hassle. They need to provide a dedicated, matched powerhead and connections - the list in the instruction manual of compatible units is not accurate!"
2,Would Be Great Except For Stupid Design Flaws,"This would offer an immense amount of biological filtration for the dollar except for two stupid design flaws. First, anytime the power goes off and the filter loses flow, the sand fills up the input tube. This requires removing the sand through the hole in the top and replacing it the same way, which is an extraordinarily tedious task. Second, the seal on the bottom is very poor quality. I've had two develop leaks, one right out of the box. Lifeguard probably saved a dime in manufacturing costs and the result was a very bad product. Dumb, dumb, dumb."
2,bad product,"if it works, it works good but after some time it start leaking. This happened me twice at the bottom of both filter. Bad quality. cheap glue used I think"
4,Good buy,"I haven't installed the replacement units I purchased yet. Cleaned up the old ones and put some dielectric compound on them. But when I do need them, I now have them ready to go!"
5,Item just as described and 1/2 the price of the dealer,This item was brand new in the package and it was exactly what we needed for our 99 Buick Century - I works great is was over 1/2 the price of what it would have cost at the dealer.
5,Auto Headlight Part,I purchased this part for my 1999 Olds and it was an exact replacement. Was I pleasantly surprised. You can't beat the price!
5,Nick's Granddaughter,I love my pop-pops CD...he is the best grandpa! i love going to family parties and hearing him sing! pop-pop your GREAT!
5,New Re-Mastered Edition To Be Released!,"The SOMERS DREAM ORCHESTRA is proud to announce a NEW Re-Mastered 2001 Edition of their critically acclaimed CD, ""A Mid-Somers Night Dream.""

4,"However un-pragmatic, An Ideal Supposition","Mr. Brown's proposition for a wholly independant Black America is the best thing I have read in a while. However, I find fault in his conclusions because he speaks too much of ""what could have been"" had the civil rights movement taken a different angle. We must discuss a viable solution for 1999.I laud Mr. Brown for his stance on Black Capitalism! If Money=Power, then More Money=More Power! The primary goal of Black Americans should be to start their own businesses, small and large, manufacturing, wholesale, retail, services etc.! Once this takes place, we can build our own economic infrastructure, semi-independent of that of the ""establishment"". I believe this is what I read in Black Lies, White Lies. It is the defnitive solution to Black dependance."
2,Disappointing,"I wish I could enthusiastically recommend thisbook, but I found myself with too manyopen ended questions and not enough informationwith which to resolve those questions.Tony Brown appears to have meticulously referencedthe information presented in his book. Afterthat comes the hard work of looking at hisreferences, where did they get their information,what is their ideology, how did they conducttheir research, was their research biased, howdo the alternatives he presents and conclusionshe draws hold up against conflicting alternativesand conclusions.True to the title of his book, he does not appearto be interested so much in contrasting his viewswith those of others as much in presenting ""thetruth"" as he sees it.As a reference for Tony Brown's point of view, Ifound this book interesting and refreshing. Asa book of scholarship there's entirely too muchhomework at the end of his point of view for meto wholeheartedly recommend it."
4,INDISPENSABLE TO THE FANS,"this release was clearly aimed for the established Mercyful Fate fan,as these are essentially unreleased /out-takes of various sound quality.this should not be construed as negative,however as these tracks have that inmistakable Fate magic - all the ingredients are present;heavy,catchy & King's classic falsetto.for the uninitiated,one should probably start with one of their earlier studio recordings for a point of reference(again,the production differs from track to track here).for the fan,add another star"
2,A Fair Compilation.,"This is a fair compilation of Mercyful Fate's unreleased and rare material. Nothing really stands out on this release. King Diamond did sound quite different in the earlier days though. The songs aren't bad, but don't leave much of an impression either."
3,"Should have been titled Pictorial History, not Atlas.","We couldn't wait to order this book when we read about its release. How disappointed we were when we began to read it.Silly us; we had expected maps in an atlas.We didn't realize that this was a picture book. There is text, too, and it is informative. Many people are unaware of the eastern European origins of the Celts, or of their unique cultural contributions to later culture.The photos are beautiful. One can learn much about Celtic History from this book; however,if you are expecting a book of maps, you might be disappointed."
4,A broad and brief history based on latest facts,"This book covers a lot of history so it is understandably brief on some aspects. This book is good for anyone looking for an accurate and fun introduction. Lots of pictures helps to give context. A lot of focus of the book is on archealogical finds. A good starter but for history buffs the ""eras"" (i.e. pre-roman contact) of celtic civilization are going to give a couple of archealogical facts but mostly the authors interpretation is given. Konstam and Kean clearly are knowledgable, up-to-date with archeaology and interested in challenging myths of celtic history."
3,Nice Watch if You Like Pink,"You can't really see it in the photos but the hands and wings are pink in color and look bad.It's really too bad because other than the poor color choice it's a very nice, big watch. It has a quality Myota non-hacking automatic movement. You get a nice view of the movement through the see-through back. Overall this is a high quality automatic watch for an excellent price, I just wish it didn't have pink highlights."
4,Very large Watch,"I own this watch, it is a 21 jewel automatic, not quartz watch though. Bought the self winder, through Amazon to keep it wound and keep the time up-to-date.. Not my every day watch though."
2,Hard to grow,"Although I followed the conditions for this plant, it failed. I have an excellent growing area, but all I grew were fungus flis. I would not recommend this for someone who does not have a greenhous. Very lovely plant, but not good for the average home."
4,Decent,"This book covers Russian small arms ranging from the AN-94, VSS, Groza, and even some of Ivan's underwater guns. The author quite clearly knows his stuff and provides interesting and useful information for those interested in the development and capabilities of Russian small arms. I would like to see another edition of this book in the future, (I would most definitely purchase it) and maybe even a bigger section on handguns. Other than that, I have no real complaints with this book and think it was worth the price I paid, and a welcome edition to my small arms reference library."
3,Great Everyday Watch,Great watch to have when you need something you don't mind getting beat up a little. Wears great!!
5,A must in your CD library,"I originally purchased this as a gift. After reading the reviews ordered one for myself and then 3 more as gifts. Obviously I was extremely pleased with this CD. The original purchase was for my therapist who holds meditation sessions and she loved it as well. My life has been upside down and this is helping to relive stress and help me take back my life in many ways. Example, my attorney, after 8 months without a car keeps telling me not to buy a car until my affairs are settled which could be another 3-4 months. After listening to this CD I took charge of my life and realized I am the only one who knows what I need. I bought a car. It has helped me to empower myself."
3,A little too much intro,"I ordered this CD because the ones I have are all over 2 years old now and I wanted something new to listen to. Overall, this meditation is ok, but there is approximately 6 minutes of intro. at the beginning detailing the benefits of meditation, etc. For someone who has meditated for a while, this is inconvenient and annoying to have to listen to every time. This could have been put on as a separate track to be listened to once and then not have to be dealt with each time one wants to meditate. My current CD player does not have a 'skip' function, so everytime I want to meditate to this CD I have to stand there and hold down the fast forward button until I get past 6 minutes. Not the worst thing in the world, but irritating and I certainly don't want irritation before meditation. So, if you are more tolerant than I or if you have a 'skip' function on your CD player, then I would say to give this CD a try."
1,Silly whispering,I agree 100% with the reviewer who stated that Mantell whispers to the listener as if he/she is a child. What a disappointment this CD is after reading all the positive reviews here. Pretty short and lacking in depth also.
5,Great! Muito bom!,Entregue no prazo correto. A embalagem também foi adequada. A meditao guiada e excelente para usar no trabalho ou em outros lugares públicos.
4,Stress Relief CD,"Good guided meditation, which is very relaxing. I find that I very often drop off to sleep while listening to this CD."
2,Too Short,"""Your Present: A Half-Hour of Peace: A Guided Imagery Meditation for Physical & Spiritual Wellness"" has a misleading title. While the CD is 35 minutes long, there is a 10 minute introduction and 10 minutes of music at the end. The actual meditation is only about 20 minutes long.There is only 1 track on this CD, so you can't skip the introduction. You are better off buying a different meditation CD."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have been meditating daily for about 5 weeks by now. At first, I used to think meditation was ""such boring homework"", so I bought some guided meditation CD's. Now I prefer just sitting with no CD, but I still think it might help you to start meditating if you have no previous teaching or experience. Nevertheless, I would not recommend this specific one. I wish it had less distractions. I wish the music were not digital, and I wish the narrator talked a lot less. If you are looking for some guides, buy something else or check out You Tube. If you type ""guided meditation"" at You Tube, you will find lots and lots of stuff to start with. And then see if a guided meditation works for you at all."
5,Perfect for relaxation,"When I get tense and stresses, this cd is my perfect get-a-way to a different, relaxing place. It carries me there and gives me a break from the fast- paced life I live. It's a treasure that I share as a gift for birthdays and weddings (great for a couple to do together)"
3,Long and Boring Introduction,"Susie Mantel has a soothing voice but her introduction goes on far too long. And you have to listen to it each time you play the CD. There is no way to jump to the actual meditations. She is giving us a rather syrupy ""pep talk"" and promising great things to come if we just de-stress. But words are cheap and it is a long, boring time before we actually get some instruction as to HOW we can improve our lot.However, if and when you get to the de-stressing part, it is pretty good. The music is pleasing but more often than not I just can't put up with her sermon-like beginning to finish the CD. I am finding it is my last choice for these types of CDs. I love Indigo Dreams and Sleep Solutions because I can skip to the parts that really help me."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"The cd is okay. Below is a list of pros and cons.Pros:-It is relaxing-I fall asleep each time I listen to it-I feel more rested in the morning when I listen to the cd-Some of the exercises could be helpful to multiple peopleCons:-There is only one track on the cd, so you have to listen to the same introduction each time unless you fast forward it.-The woman talks very closely into the microphone, which can be annoying at times."
4,One of the better ones out there,"This would have been better if there had been 2 tracks, so that when you're ready to listen you could just skip the intro instead of having to press the fast forward button when she starts with ""Please don't drive while listening to this.""The music is perfect and she does have a lovely, friendly voice and great pace to her narration. It's great to help you sleep. One of the best things I can say about this CD is that I've never heard the end of it. I'm always well asleep before it gets there. A great CD to listen to with headphones."
5,This is a Tape to Help YOU Help YOURSELF,"We each pull from this tape exactly what we need. I look forward to listening to it every night. Her voice, the background music, and the imagery are soothing and healing. I have never made it to the end of the CD because I fall asleep within ten minutes. My mind used to race at night and not even Ambien could put me to sleep. This CD and the DVD Yoga for Stress Relief have helped me immensely and now I feel empowered and at ease with life. This CD is true to its name: it will bring you peace and physical and spiritual wellness. This is the CD you have been waiting for your whole life - ORDER IT NOW!"
5,Meditate: Find Peace and Happiness,"Meditation is an incredible tool to ground yourself and find peace. It has changed my life.I began meditating after reading and listening toLiving The Secret Everyday. As a follower ofThe Secret, I have found that changing my thoughts has changed my life. I still use My Secret Workbook and the companion CD daily. I recently added this CD which is wonderful as well. Another CD,Meditation for Beginnersis also quite effective."
4,helps you to relax,"This CD does not really helps you to sleep, but it does achieved the relaxation part which is very important to have a pleasant sleep, I never have sleep problems but sometimes after I listen to it I feel alert and awake . The music and the voice are very nice. what it really does it helps to let you day begin a refresh you mind. The magical part of it is, every time you listen to it you ll find something new or something has new meaning as she says. that is awesome"
1,Really? An award winner?,"I, like some others here, purchased this based on ""as seen on"", ""highly recommended by Library Journal"" and lastly the gold seal from Publishers Weekly. I wished I had noticed that there was no way to sample this and that should have been a red flag for not buying it. I won't make that mistake again. I found this woman's voice very annoying and her message contrived. The choice of music was equally annoying. The only thing I can figure out from all these rave reviews is that there must be some type of connection with this woman and the people who gave it 5 stars. I really resent that I paid money for this CD. I will stick to my other guided meditation CD's or a class for further instructions. Amazon, please enable an audio sample."
2,Disappointed,"I was under the impression that this would be a collection of music to just ""relax"" & ""unwind"". Instead it was ""talking over music"". It was not what I expected."
4,great item,"Originally I thought this item came with a book. Let seller know this, they sent a book, to remedey the situation. GREAT CUSTOMER service. Thanks"
2,"It was ok, not wow","I was expecting a longer session, tone and background sounds are perfect for mediattion though. I dont use it as much as my other products"
2,not quite a sleeper,"This is the standard guided imagery stuff, from head to toe. You know the drill. ""Feel your little toe: tense and relax. Ahhh - there. Isn't that wonderful?"" And so on all the way u[ to the top of your head. It is distinguished from other similar products on relaxation only by the somewhat artifical and condescending voice of Mantell. Honestly, the coyness and honey dripping from her lips are more effective of keeping you awake than in encouraging relaxation. Her voice encourages you to lie there and wonder if she is for real, and soon your mind is going a mile a minute trying to remember if you have ever heard anyone else with such cloying vocal qualities. If you like being talked to as if you were a child, especially one looking for sympathy, then this CD is for you."
1,A big disappointment!,"The exceptionally long introduction was extremely annoying the first time through - warning listeners not to listen to the CD while driving, etc. I just knew I couldn't listen to this every time I wanted to hear the CD. I found it so frustrating and never listened to it again. There are much better relaxation CD's available! Try ""Sleep through Insomnia"" instead."
5,I love this CD,"I love this CD. I hadn't listened to it for a while, but last night I was tossing & turning until 3 a.m., the alarm was set for 5:30 a.m. I felt so helpless. I had work issues on my mind, very stressful project at work. I just could not calm my mind. I noticed my cd player on the nightstand and this cd was already loaded. I put on the headphones and drifted off into blissful sleep not even making it to the end of the cd. I woke up on time and felt like I had a full night's sleep. I am ordering extras for friends and relatives, this is the perfect gift."
2,"It seems everyone else likes this, but I was disappointed","I couldn't stand listening to this woman's voice. There was just something about the way she whispered to me like a 5 year old telling me a secret. It just drove me crazy and was definitely anything but relaxing.I'm glad it is working for other people, but personally I just couldn't stand it."
4,Beautiful Guided Imagery audio cd,"I love this cd, I awake about a half an hour before I need to often so this cd works beautifully with 35 minutes of guided imagery for physical and spiritual wellness. Even if you drift in and out the benefits are magnificent. You awake refreshed and soothed, I recite and write down a few affirmations and gratitude notes and off I go to enjoy my day."
5,Love this DVD!,"I have had this program in tape format for years and decided to upgrade to a DVD. I LOVE this program. It is perhaps the most useful tool that I use in a day. It's great for clearing your head, relaxing, and focusing on what really matters in your life. It's only 30 minutes, and even if you choose the option to relax and fall asleep, you will actually wake up after 30 minutes. Undoubtedly all the good ""stuff"" is still rolling around in your head. I highly recommend this program!"
3,"Good, but needs something","I've never tried meditating to a recording before, so this was a new experience for me. There's a warning at the beginning that says to not use this while driving (well, duh!), but it should also mention a bit more about your position, sitting, lying down, etc before it starts. I do wish she would speak a bit faster during the instructions, as it adds several minutes to the cd. Over all it was pretty good, but about the time I started dozing off, she started talking again!"
2,Didn't last the whole CD,"This CD is someone talking with very quiet music in the background. There isn't anything new here - New Age affirmations, positive thinking, etc. I became bored and turned it off."
2,Based on the awards & reviews I thought I would like this...,"But it has not met my expectations. To me it seems to rushed and does not give good imagery or any relaxation exercises such as breating, or tense/relax. I rarely listen to it. For an excellent relaxation CD, buy Kalamalka Colors"
3,Not as wonderful,"Before deciding what relaxation audio to buy, I read the reviews on this page and based my decision on them. The CD is not as great or magical as described by some of the other reviewers; it certainly does not make me fall asleep. And it really does not help you relax. Maybe the reviewers *believe* or *sense* that the CD helps them relax since you are sitting still or laying down with your eyes closed for thirty minutes. And that is relaxing. But then you can do that without purchasing this CD."
5,Excellent!,"Ms. Mantell has done a wonderful job with this CD. I am a person who ocassionally suffers from insomnia and after a week of listening to this, I fell asleep! Her soothing voice lures you into a relaxed state without you really realizing what has happened. My husband, who has a very stressful/busy type of job likes it because he can listen to it during his lunch hour and feel refreshed for the rest of the day. This is a must have. I recommend it highly."
5,"Pleasant voice, efficient relaxation","I found susie mantell's voice such a lovely soothing voice tha I would recommend the CD just for her voice! Her technique is quite efficient too. You will really relax during her half hour which she calls your present[privileged time to spend with yourself for yurself]. This CD is also a present, a gift to yourself if you buy it. It will create the desired effect and promote healing.I like especially when she speak of a bridge to which you come; she gives you the choice to cross it now or later. So much of my life looks like a road reaching a bridge that it is a very speial proposition to me to consider crossing the bridge!At least cross the bridge to acquire this lovely CD and spend so many relaxing half hours that you'll find really pleasant."
5,An opportunity to relax and release your creative flow.,"Often, when the creative juices are flowing too rapidly, stress responses set in. Just a half hour with the soothing sounds and guided imagery on Susie Mantell's audio allow me to re-focus, relax, get centered and be even more creative without stressing out. Sometimes it's helpful to make a space for this meditative time in the late afternoon hours, when food might be the band-aid for a stressful day or at night, just before falling asleep, I use the imagery to set myself up for peaceful dreams. It's a wonderful gift to give to myself."
5,I feel 30% better each time I listen to the CD,"Each time I listen to this CD, the soothing voice and music create the feeling of being loved and a flow of nice sensations. The moment I hear the music I get aware how tense I am, how ready to defend myself from all the possible and imaginative attacks, from pain, and guilt. Susie helps to let the tension go and allow something gentle and caring to come in, and also discover along the way what I really want in life.I practice regular meditation; however, from time to time I play the Half-Hour of Peace and it is like balm. I highly recommend this CD."
2,"cute, but not a good sorter OR pull toy","This is a well made and attractive wooden toy. As a pull toy it falls short in that the string is too short for the wheels to stay on the floor with our child has the string in his hand. As a sorter, it is useless. Maybe as a child gets older, he will put the shapes into the proper receptacles. Until then, if he uses the shapes at all, he puts them into the open back. The open back is a problem, though. When the toy is pulled (carried around) the shapes just fall out the back. Our guy does seem to enjoy placing the driver into its proper spot, at least. Save your money and buy a GOOD pull toy and a GOOD sorter. This one is not good in either category."
2,does not roll well with string,with the string you would think this is targeted at slightly older babies but it does not roll well and constantly tips over. My daughter was never interested at all and the pieces are a bit small. bought something similar for 1/4 the price at IKEA she likes much better.
3,Not much fun,"I bought this as a birthday present for my one year old. I myself love wooden toys and he loves trucks and cars and anything with a string attached! He has not played with it much. The quality is great, but it only comes with three blocks, kind of lame. Also, if you move the car at all the blocks immediately fall out, the ""dump"" option doesn't really work either. All in all a good quality toy but not very well thought out."
1,Inaccurate,I purchased this as it was top rated by Cooks Illustrated Magazine. The first use proved that it was wildly inaccurate as compared to 2 other reliable instant read thermometers. Buy stuff like this locally as it is a hassle to exchange via the mail.
5,Taylor Wireless Oven Thermometer with Remote Pager,I love it!! It is easy to setup - none needed. I can set any temperature I want and the remote stays in range anywhere in the house when I use it on the grill. No more hovering over slow cooked meats getting bored.
1,Base appears to work - but remote is a joke,This is a cheap piece of junk. The base won't communicate with the remote even after extensive review of directions and trying different channel selections as directed. The plastic housings are so lightweight I don't think it'd survive ordinary outdoor use either. Certianly not a drop off your grill. Felt like I had to handle it gingerly so I didn't crush it with my hands. This one is going back -Sorry AZ.
1,Stopped working almost immediately,"This thermometer worked well once or twice, and then it quit on me. I'm hoping to return it for something better."
1,Really no stars,Product read 140 degrees on meat that was directly out of fridgerator. With in 1 minute product read 150 degrees. didn't work at all can't tell you if it ever read right due to BQ fire.
1,Worked brilliantly exactly once.,"Worked brilliantly, but only once. The probe burned out after only one use."
2,Great device - Until the probe fails,"If the probe was not so fragile I'd give this unit 5 stars. The remote works well although I have had it lose contact with the sender if I was out in front of my house (my grill is on the back deck). This is a minor annoyance, but what really ticked me off was that the probe failed (indicating ""HIGH"" reading) in conditions where my MIU France unit keeps on going. Unfortunately the MIU France unit doesn't have the remote capability. I purchased about 5 extra probes for the Taylor unit directly from Taylor by mail. But within a few weeks several of those failed. I don't mind having to replace a probe once in a while but when you have to replace two in one cooking session it gets pretty annoying. I'd suggest staying away from this unit."
1,Unit Failed,The product has a real cheap feel. I have another unit from another manufacture and it's feels more solid and seems to work better.I liked the features but it just doesn't seem to hold up. The unit I have right now no longer will show the temp. It just shows HI or LOW. Before that I had issues where I had to reboot the system or power it off and leave it off for awhile before it would work again. The unit just needs to work. You have cooking to do not fighting with your tools.Just pass on this one and buy someone elses product.
1,Broke after one use,Nice idea but it broke after one use. Polder makes a better one. So does Sharper Image.
1,Cook's Illustrated recommendation a.... !DUD!,"This item was recommended by Cook's Illustrated magazine.I used it to grill a london broil. I set it to med rare.It worked for about 10 minutes. This was the first time I used it.I do not believe the meat reached 140 Deg.The gas grill had a full corrugated bottom plate between the gas burner and grill grate. (No open flame on cable) The cable was only exposed in the grill for approx 6"".I will not buy Taylor products again or renew Cook's Magazine.If I do not get a full refund, I will not buy Amazon again."
2,The ball is pink...,"Would be nice to get a ball that is as pictured...I thought I made a mistake, but clearly, the product page shows a black/green ball. Not going to bother returning. Too much hassle."
2,My boys aren't thrilled we got a pink ball....,Ordered this ball which appears green & white and got a pink ball - needless to say my two boys are not thrilled.
4,CNN Video - War in the Gulf: The Conflict Begins,"Description from the back of the cover:Narrated by Bernard ShawOn August 2, 1990, Iraqi tanks rumbled into the tiny oil-rich emirate of Kuwait, triggering the turmoil that would soon engulf many of the world's nations in conflict. For the first time in a century, Arab attacked Arab, sending shock waves through the Middle East and beyond. But the war drums had been beating for months. And the conflict between Kuwait and Iraq had festered for years. Were the signs ignored? Did the White House know more than it revealed? CNN's award-winning ""Special Reports"" team forges the global newsgathering efforts of the Cable News Network into a compelling tale of historical hatreds, diplomatic ploys and military might in the opening chapters of the War in the Gulf. Runs approximately 90 minutes, not rated."
4,well fitting and nice profile,"fits me well without being too big. bought this in both the rainbow colors and plain black. skirt is a nice touch without being overwhelming; I do a lot of swimming, and the skirt does float up in the water, but because there isn't too much material, it doesn't slow me down, and yet I feel ""covered up"" when I get out of the pool. runs a little smaller than I thought a 16 would be (fits more like a 14), but it was surprisingly comfortable and shapely."
3,MSW II,"Although I love the series of Murder, she wrote, I should have known better than to order the 2nd season with it being on a 2 sided DVD. I went through all kinds of problems with the 1st season because the one disc would not play at all. I tried 3 of them. At least I can say that with the 2nd season at least the entire disc is not faulty. It's just 2 of the shows that will not play. I don't think I'll order anymore DVD's that are two sided."
2,murder she wrote--second season,"the disks in this set are double sided and there are problems. one or two of the episodes are unreadable. we returned the first set, which had an entire unreadable side on one of the cd's. the replacement was better, but not perfect. the single sided cd's in other sets are MUCH better and highly reliable as to quality. double sided just have built in flaws and i wish they would discontinue them."
2,Bad DVD quality,"Unfortunately, Universal continues to use 2 sided dual layer without much success. The 3rd episode on the first disc was unwatchable. This happened in the 1st season as well. What's up with this?????????? Can't they provide single sided DVDs and quality? --- Universal must not have anyone that actually sits down and watches it end to end. I don't get the set to return it multiple times and finally just end up keeping something I can't watch all of. What a shame as Murder She Wrote is a true classic."
2,"Good series, awful dvd","I bought this for my mom who enjoyed the series and I found that I actually enjoyed it also. The one problem, and a big one, is that the dvds are defective. I tried playing them on three different players and the results were the same. The pixels were messed up on several of the shows and, in two cases, stopped playing altogether. A couple of the shows could not be watched to the end because they would start and stop and then eventually stop completely. Returning the item is too much of a headache so we decided to let it go. I also purchased seasons 1 and 3 for her and have no such problems. One I believe I purchased through Amazon and the other elsewhere. We just decided we will be purchasing no more boxed sets in this series."
2,I thought it was my DVD player,"I should have read the reviews first and I would have discovered it wasn't my DVD player at all. Well, I went out and purchased a little more expensive one it wasn't that expensive so I don't feel totally awful. Universal didn't mess up a great series because the shows are still great it's just that the DVD's are awful, they messed up the DVD's and they need to send new copies to everyone who purchased the sets free. I am hesitant, and probably will not, purchase set three until I hear they have corrected the problem."
2,Can't watch the whole DVD,This WOULD be a great DVD set if I were able to watch all the episodes that are listed on the backs of the cases. It is bizarre to me that the cases list 13-14 episodes when I can't watch more than 3-4 before it cuts off and takes me back to the main menu. What a rip-off to advertise so many episodes and offer so few!
5,"Murder, She Wrote - Season Two",Angela Lansbury is one of my favorite actors. Season Two was even better than Season One. I would recommend this purchase for all fans.
4,"5 stars for the series, 1 star for DVD","I initially bought the first season over a year ago direct from Time Life and was so disappointed by the quality of the DVD's. two episodes would play halfway through and then stop, it was so annoying. A a fan of the original series and the reruns although they are getting harder to come by, I am still interested in the discs but thankfully my local library has them so i don't have to spend good money for poor dvd's. A true fan will suffer through them out of love but the quality will not entice newcomers to this beloved series. Universal had better wake up and start puting out better merchandise for the money."
1,Murder She Wrote Season 2,"I had to return set because Disc 1 was damanged, replacement was also damanged. Would like to repurchase when problem is resolved."
1,"5 stars for show, one stars for disc quality","i must echo complaints about disc quality. two sets i bought at costco have problems in the same area: the last two episodes on the first two discs jerk and freeze and pixelate. one side is completely unplayable. the only side that worked was the very last side with only two episodes. good thing costco has a 100% return policy, even on opened DVDs. will keep returning this dvd until i find a copy that plays, or costco runs out of sets."
5,Murder She wrote: 1st season,Got both the 1st and second season packs for my Dad for Christmas. They are great. We watched the first two hour episode on Christmas night. Would recommend anyone who wants a good mystery without the gore and sex found in so many of the newer series.
3,Yea! Can't Wait!!!,I am sooo happy this is coming out-just in time for Christmas family! I love this series and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD. Universal please keep putting them out as soon as possible!
3,Correction,Angela Lansbury's husband was Peter SHAW not Peter Fischer as noted in a previous review.
2,I will never buy used dvd s again,I have not viewed all three disks of Murder she wrote yet. So far the first disk will only play half way. I hope the other two disks are better. from now on I will only buy NEW.
5,"Murder, She Wrote","I ordered a set of shows and when I tried to play them I, too, experienced frozen frames and an inability to skip to new chapters. Thankfully, I was dealing with a reputable seller who not only replaced the flawed set, but did not even require me to return the damaged one. So--unhappy with the manufacturer, very satisfied with the seller."
2,So disappointed,"First of all, I am very happy with Amazon's service. They were fast, the price was right, and--after the problem was revealed--they handled the return with no trouble. I am just so very disappointed that this product was defective. I ordered the 2nd Season of Murder She Wrote twice--from another vendor and then this time directly from Amazon. Two disks in this season were so defective (pixelated, getting stuck, just not working right) that we just could not watch them. I asked if I could purchase just the disks and could not."
2,Show Series Great; DVD Quality Poor,"I love the Murder She Write Series and greatly anticipated the show being released on DVD. I have both Season 1 and Season 2. I love watching the episodes themselves, but am very disappointed in the quality of the DVDs themselves. I understand that it is not happening with every DVD set, but a lot of the sets (including both of mine) have DVDs that skip and stop. I have to skip entire chapters of the shows just to get to the next episode. The problem is using both sides of the DVD to store the episodes on. If any research had been done on two-sided DVDs prior to putting this wonderful show on the cheaper two-sided format, then we would not be having so many DVDs sets skipping. I really wish they had gone for the better quality route and not the cheaper route."
1,ME TOO!! FIVE STARS FOR THE SERIES BUT ONE STAR FOR THE DVD QUALITY!!,"Does anyone know a phone number or email we can write to at Universal to complain about this? The same thing happened with first season. Many episodes freeze on their frames and cannot be watched. Surely Universal has had several complaints about this. Does anyone know if they are going to do anything about it? The series itself is exceptional but we, the buying public deserve a quality DVD. This is not what we're getting!!"
1,DVDs did not work!,What a dissappointment! I gave this to my husband for Christmas and the first side didn't play at all and the second kept freezing. I saw that several other people had the same problem. So glad I didn't buy another DVD-player; I almost did. I assumed it must be my player. I hope that this will be fixed in the next releast since we both love the series. There was no problem with the first season. Too bad!
1,Heart broke,"My daughter has ordered four sets of this season and not one of these sets will play good enough to watch. The first two sets were Christmas gifts. The second sets were replacements for the first two and they would not play either. We tried them in different dvd players to no avail. I can't tell you how disappointed we are. It looks like we will have to do without the second season until Universal gets their act together. I also doubt if the third season will be purchased. To anyone buying these dvds, good luck."
2,Murder she wrote second season,"We like the series, but the second and third disk were defective and stopped in the middle of the story."
5,Murder She Wrote - Complete Set,"TV seems to be more interested in the cheaper productions and not on quality programming we have enjoyed in the past. Some TV channels like Hallmark may show one of the older involved programs (like Seventh Heaven or Murder She Wrote) then if they get complaints they take it off the air. By having this boxed set, it has been wonderful to start with the first show and watch one or two shows each evening - with the luxury of no commercials - to your hearts content. The first challenge for us was discovering that each DVD was recorded on both sides so far - the second surprise was to open year two or three and find only an empty box. Not to worry - it was promptly replaced and all is well. Thank you for your broad range of choices and your responsiveness."
5,Everythng old is new again,This season has some of my favorite episodes. It is so nice to see classic television whenever you want.
2,Damaged but credited,"Several of the episodes on the DVDs were damaged. When I contacted the vendor re an exchange, I was told that they did not have another copy to exchange so they issued me credit. This was disappointing but satisfactory."
5,Good buy,"I had read the previous reviews on this about how the skin collects lint when you put it in your pocket so that worried me. I've had it for several months now and I found that is a very minor issue. I just use a moist lens wipe and the lint comes right off and it looks brand new. The skin itself is awesome, but I wish it glowed! Another weird thing is the assembly: the nano slides in through the window, which is do-able, but difficult. And I had originally thought that the screen protector was part of the skin, but that's separate and slips inbetween the two skins, which is a little difficult to position. Overall, very happy with it! Highly recommend."
4,D's. Grandma,"My Grandson loves Sonic. He was so excited to get this not so tall version. It looks exactly like Sonic and was the best representation of the character that we could find. I personally think the character is ugly but then I'm a Grandma, not a child. What would I know? D.(age 6) is very, very happy with his Sonic."
4,My son loves it!,"My son absolutely loves this toy. It's actually very well made. The legs are a little floppy, but as long as your child doesn't try to rip it apart, I think they would hold up. My son brings it everywhere and calls it his ""brother."" I'm happy with this purchase."
2,My son loved it - but the head almost fell off...literally...,"My son absolutely loved his doll!Unfortunately, it was poorly made and the head almost fell off. The shape of the head made it difficult to sew the head back on, so for now it's pinned on until I can get it out of my sons grip in order to sew it back on.It served it's purpose, but it was poorly made."
2,plush sonic the hedge hog,Cute but not for heavy play. Has a string on top of its head like you are supposed to hang it. Material doesn't seem durable for a child to play with.
4,good book,"this book is not only cheap! but is also a very good reference book. It might not be very reader friendly at the beginning, but if you have a sort of background it is ok."
4,Not bad... Internal fan's a little loud,Pros:-Two outlets to use-Works with any standard US plug-Don't need additional/special cords to plug into carCons:-The internal fan is a little loud... but not loud enough that you can hear it on the other end of cell phone conversations.Some uses:-Charge an electric razor to freshen up between calls/meetings-Charge laptop between sales calls/meetings-Charge cell phone & BlueTooth headset at the same timeMust have:-If you live in your car-If you are a salesman-If you have more than a couple of electronic devices and don't want to buy/carry additional cords for them in your car
4,Only one issue,"I used the Smart AC 210 Watt Inverter on a recent 8 hour cart trip. The biggest issue I had with it is the two outlets are so close together that it precludes the use of two AC adapters at once (regular sized plugs might work). As a single outlet, I was first able to plug in a small router to get WiFi access in my car. Later, we used it to plug in my son's Nintendo DS. We had no problems with it, but the DS plug and the router plug did not fit on the inverter at the same time.I could not hear the fan noise over the noise in the car, which included my daughter's DVD player and the radio. Other than the inability to use both outlets at once, I am happy with this product._______UPDATE 2/2/13: I plugged in a small handheld vaccuum, and the power outlet immediately ceased to function. My fault for not thinking about the wattage. :("
4,Road Trip,I hope this works because i only have a 12v-10w output in my acura MDX and i heard that this one coverts it into a higher voltage i want to hook my xbox 360 up with a tv the xbox is 100 watts and the tv 56 so im oretty sure it will work. IM GOING ON A 10 HOUR TRIP TO NORTH CAROLINA WOOOOOOT!!!!
1,Serious Frustration even for a 6-year-old...and boring...,"Our 6-year-old daughter just got this bear for her birthday - unfortunatley, it doesn't work the way they claim. I hid it at one end of the house, my daughter began searching in the opposite end of the house and the transmitter said ""You're getting warmer... (which obviously she wasn't...)"". Half the time she just found the bear accidentally without it giving any hints at all - it just kept saying comments like ""You're fun to play with"" and other such statements, but nothing to help direct her to the bears location. She just ended up wandering around the house and the comments coming from the transmitter were mostly haphazard and had nothing to do with where the bear was located. So the ""fun"" lasted for barely 10 minutes. I would love to return it, but we already threw away the box... If your child wants this toy, I would highly suggest you try to guide her toward something else."
1,Junk,"The product more or less randomly tells your child she's getting warmer, and occasionally colder. This is a useless toy that should never have been sent to market. Even worse, you have to reach into the bear to get to the ""off"" switch, which makes me wonder whether I'll have to put new batteries in every time my kids use it. Save your money."
2,care bear hide-n-seek,"this was terrible...first they had the control box wired into the box it came in, so we literally had to RIP it out of the box to get it out...it will not tell you that you are warm or close unless you are about 1-2 inches from the bear...do not buy!!"
1,Disappointing,"The hide n seek care bear really wasn't all it was made out to be. My kids played with it, with my husband, on Christmas, and they all gave up after 5 minutes. It was giving out wrong directions, and just wasn't really a good substitute for a game of hide and seek. So my girls forgot about the remote control and play with the doll like it's an ordinary stuffed animal--an rather expensive stuffed animal!"
3,Fun for the very young,"I fully believe that the messages on this toy are random, I don't think that there is any device that measures how far away the bear is. If there is, it malfunctions badly. The info page on this states 4-6, 6 is really too old for this toy, a 4 or young 5 year old would find it most entertaining - a child that does not have the ability to remember which way they were ""getting warmer"". This is not the toy to teach a young child the basics of wayfinding, it's a silly game of hide and seek with audio and flashing lights. The bear should be hid within the child's ability to find it on their own, perhaps confined to one or two rooms. The child had a lot of fun with it when she turned 5, then she seemed to hit a mental threshold later and found it annoying because the messages made no sense."
1,Small,These were way too small for my needs. And over priced for the size. Which I would of gotten something different.
2,A Little Too Thorough!,"I used this book as the text in a university linguistics course. Baker and Jones are very thorough in their analysis of bilingualism and bilingual education. At times, they are so thorough that the subject matter is much too elementary and common-sensical. It's also extremely repetitive. However, as a basic and solid reference for any questions or research one might need, this volume is sure to help."
1,A piece of crap,"This is one of the worst albums ever made. Peter does songs that are pure moronic delights from the ridiculous ""that's the kind of sugar papa love"" to his pathetic cover of ""Tossin ' and turnin"".The song selections are just pure crap for peter criss's voice. Why didn't he perform songs like ""Black Diamond"" and ""Beth"".These songs suit his voice perfectly and though they have that Kiss sound it still is the only fit for his voice.This album is equal to a day on the toilet with diarrhea.It adds up to a long day of endless chunky dumps!!!!!!It is just pure crap and Peter would've known better if he hadn't been busy boozing and drugging it up..Oh well.If you're into torture or into smelly poop then scoop this one up.It's sure to stink up your crib!!!!!!!"
1,BAD,"I do not understand how any Kiss fan could listen to this album. I still have this album on 8-track, I got it for a dollar and I still think I was robbed. There is not one song good on this album. I may be biased but Eric Carr is 20 times the musician that Peter Criss is."
1,An obstrocity to the Rock and Roll era we once knew !,This album is a Dog ! When I found out that I wasted my money on this I wove out a tapestry of obscenities that as far as we know to this day still hangs in space over Lake Michigan.
2,One Listen Is Enough....,"Yeah, yeah, yeah....listen with an open mind. This is still the worst of the 4 Kiss solo albums by far (Ace's is the only one worth a dang). Even if you can appreciate the varied musical stylings, Criss is still a very weak drummer; and by his own admission tone deaf! I would bet my life savings most people who bought this album gave it only one listen, if that. In the days of vinyl, most Kiss fans never even turn the disc over to side 2...back into the paper sleeve it went! One star for the music with an extra star for Peter to have the b@lls to put his name on this."
3,Peter Criss first solo,"First off Peter Criss does have an interesting singing voice.It's a nice departure from the vocals of Gene or Paul.I always liked it when Peter sang a song for Kiss.But it's a pity the talent does not shine on this solo record.I remember as a kid trying to like this record,after all I was a fan and I liked Peter so I didn't want to say anything bad about it.But it's years later and I can honestly say most of this record just plain sux!It does have some excellent songs with I cant Stop The Rain which is a real emotional song and i love it.Also Dont You Let Me down is another one which i like.Hooked On Rock 'N' Roll is ok but realy i havnt played this album alot over the years."
3,Peter's Influences Really Shows,Not a bad album. You can definitly hear thye big band influence with all the soulful songs on here. His downfall is that he included too many ballads. everyone likes a ballad but they get boring if there are more than 2 on any given album.
4,The Cat's Meow?,"I'll admit, this music isn't really my cup of tea. But, for what it is that the Catman did here, he did it really well, I thought. It sounds touching and heartfelt. It is kind of ironic how the song Beth, from the KISS Destroyer album, was the band's highest charting song, yet Peter Criss' album was the lowest charting of the solo albums? Still, it's a solid effort from Peter Criss and I have to hand it to him...He did it his way, and that is something to be admired."
3,Criss goes for a different sound,Criss pretty much fails in his efforts to create an album of 60's type music but I will give him some credit for trying.
3,Old Style,"A lot of Kiss fans hate this Peter Criss solo album simply because it does not sound like Kiss. Isn't that the whole point?Peter wanted to do a solo album because he was beginning to feel constricted with the hard rock format.Having being tutored by the great Gene Krupa and brought up on early do-wop and soul,it was only natural for Peter to tread down this path.Some songs work (DON'T YOU LET ME DOWN,TOSSIN' AND TURNIN',YOU STILL MATTER TO ME,I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN);some don't (HOOKED ON ROCK'N'ROLL,EASY THING,THAT'S THE KIND OF SUGAR PAPA LIKES).One thing is for sure:the Catman himself stalked it from the alley and it tested good to him,so it can't be all bad to us."
3,Honest and brave,"Peter Criss took the opportunity to record music rather different from the traditional Kiss approach. This album is rock `n' roll with a touch of disco, something you easily hear on songs like ""You matter to me"". The more straight rock `n' roll direction can be heard on ""Tossing and turning"" as well as ""That's the kind of sugar papa likes"". The opening ""I'm gonna love you"" have a melody that is hard to get out of your head - very catchy. Some songs seem to be a try to make another ""Beth"" but it certainly doesn't work. While Paul Stanley and Ace Frehley did more or less what we could expect, and Simmons tried to be musically interesting in what seem to be a calculation way, there's a sense of honesty in Peter Criss' solo effort. And it's better than its reputation!"
3,Catman!,"I think that the reason why Peter's album gets bad reviews is because of its complete departure from KISS music. Its not hard rock, its swing, jazz, soul, r&b, basically everything but hard rock. I am one of those KISS fans who loves the classic line up and make up. For me, the best music was recorded with the original KISS line up. As a drummer, I was influenced by Peter Criss and I feel he and Ace Frehley played equal roles with Gene and Paul in the creation of KISS. In fact, most people I know, when asked which member is their favorite, the answer is usually either Ace or Peter. Anyway this album is not that bad and if you are a big fan of the classic KISS, you'll want it. Even though I dont completely agree with a certain review below, I still liked the use of a quote from ""The Christmas Story"" to explain a reaction to this record. I understand where the reviewer is coming from, and ""ha ha ha""."
2,Not a good effort,Peter Criss didn't try a lot for this record. Some covers and his songs (except 2 or 3) aren't up to the KISS standard. Not a bad album but not KISS.
5,"Not what I expected, but I loved it.","I was heartbroken when Peter left the band. His departure, however, brought forth the second greatest drummer of all time, Eric Carr. (Any guesses on the first?) To fill the void, the Peter Criss solo album became a permanent resident on my record player for years. That is, until I discovered my beloved five-disc CD changer. Now, this CD and Ace's solo album are always just a push of the button away.This album truly shows Peter's musical upbringing. Not the thunder of drums, but the rhythem and jazz he loved as a kid are the highlights of this CD. He proves he is the touch of class that lies hidden within the fantastic nightmare that is KISS. This man really likes to make the girls cry."
4,Former KISS Drummer Does Good.,"By looking at the cover of this album, you'd think the whole thing was nothing but drum bashing, guitar screaming, firework exploding metal music typical of KISS. Well it's not. Oh true, there are some rock songs on this creative work by Peter Criss, but they are more in the style of Bob Seger and Rod Stewart than KISS. Hey, I love it, it's a good ablum, just not what I expected from one of the members of the most recognized hard rock band in the world. Peter's raw/coarse voice (he sounds similar to Bob Seger and Rod Stewart) is excellent to listen to. The famed singer of the Top Ten smash ""Beth"", displays his best vocal attributes on ""I Can't Stop The Rain"", ""Kiss The Girl Goodbye"", and ""Don't Let Me Down"". If you love ballads,a jazz/blues/rock sound, you'll love this album."
2,Not That Good,"I know that this is not technically a KISS album and should be treated as Peter Criss' first solo album, but it isn't that good. It sounds more like a Jazz-meets-Pop-meets-Blues album. This is a must-have for the seroius collectors, but if you're not into the aforementioned style of music, avoid this album."
5,Peter Criss review,"Fantastic album by a great rock musician.great songs and great vocals, and most importantly finishing with a powerful ballad"
3,"While 3rd Best, it's Not Bad!","Peter's album is actually quite well done and very listenable in spite of it being (in my opinion) the third best of the solo efforts. Although I consider Paul's and Ace's respectively to be the best two, Peter's is at least comparable to theirs, especially considering the dismal album done by Gene (yes, I'm the one who wrote the scathing review of Gene's album as well as castigating Ace for being stale and repetitious in his playing). With all of this in mind, Peter's album is a lot better than most want to give him credit for."
5,Consistently Solid Album,If Peter Criss would have released this after leaving Kiss it might have been a hit album. The make-up and the Kiss link stopped this from having much of a chance. It should be re-mastered and released with a different cover.
3,Listenable and satisfying.,"I think that this first solo album from Peter Criss is good and listenable. There is a total of ten tracks, and I find all of them to be satisfying and solid. Some of the songs are in a straight-ahead rock direction, while others are in more of a soul-oriented musical vein. Peter Criss does well with the drums, and he also does an entertaining and all-right job with the vocal duties. The musicianship is tight, the production is solid, and the songwriting is good. The guitar playing is also energetic. Female background vocals, brass instrumentation, and orchestration are also used in places throughout the album. The song that I like the most is ""You Matter to Me."" This tune is upbeat, danceable, and sprightly, while the keyboard playing is also melodious and infectious. The album contains four nice soft songs, too. This solo album from Peter Criss is good and worth a listen."
4,not the best but still very very good,"There's no such thing as a ""bad"" Motorhead album. They ALWAYS deliver. The only thing better than a Motorhead album is a live Motorhead album. Pure rock & roll energy that will kick your [...]. No Sleep At All is not as good as the double live CD Everything Louder Than Everything Else or the classic No Sleep Till Hammersmith. It is, however, easily at least a 4-star CD and better than 99% of the music on major labels from any time period in rock history."
1,One major flaw,"These entry knobs will open from the inside while locked. This would be okay if it unlocked the knob, but it doesn't. My older knobs that I replaced, when locked, would not allow the knob to turn from the inside and outside. You had to unlock them to get out. I see this being a problem for me and a lot of others who go out to check the mail and, not realizing the door knob is locked, come back to find a locked door."
5,Super travel book,"I always packed this book when we travelled, since it is very interactive. My daughter, now 3.5, loved making the different faces and pretending she was angry-sad or happy. The mirror worked well way before she could even talk."
3,Good for a baby!!!,My son loves to look at himself in the mirror. It's about teaching face expresion to young ones. Its a book you can live without but since I already bought it I let my son play with it.
2,Spongebob going downhill...,"These episodes is not bad, but they are not great. There were some funny parts, but they were mostly boring."
3,Pretty well-written for thrash/hardcore.,"Pete actually gets occasionally pensive on a few of the songs in this double EP. Steele whips out his Wildean wit on more than half the tunes given here; making ""Retaliation"" a better read than listen. And listen I did. Peter puts his often (unintentionally or not) comical lyrics through his grating thrash machine. Best read's ""SMD"" and ""Sex and Violence."" Hey, it's even funnier than any of ""Tank's"" recordings!"
3,"do the trick, but not really great looking","After washing a few times some of these don't look great, but they do dry OK. If you're looking for something to hang up in your kitchen or guest bathroom and look nice, these are OK but there are others in the same price range I like better. These are real weave-y, so don't hold their shape well, unless you feel like ironing, and start to look frayed. They seem a little smaller than some of the others too. The colors are nice and they hold their color pretty well. For the price, they do the trick, but I was looking for something a little nicer to display. At the new lower price, they are worth the money. They are great for drying hands."
3,okay at $8.99,I don't use cloth towels for big spills but for spot wiping and it has definitely reduced my paper towel usage so I am not that particular about absorbency. The hardest thickest fabric of the set came out shriveled from the dryer and would require ironing but I use it as a drawer liner for my global knives so I don't care.
4,Good quality dish towels,These are some decent quality dish towels in a variety of colors. A nice compliment to kitchen towels.
4,Would rate 5 stars except...,"...that this performance was trumped by the Lincoln Center performances in 2004. I've enjoyed the Berstein/Hadley/Green CD version of this piece IMMENSELY for many years, but as a live performance piece it lacks the pizazz of the Chenoweth/Lupone version.IMHO, of course....But is it worth buying? Oh for God's sake YES!"
3,Metallica?,"I just had to write since there was other review saying this sounds just like Metallica. Nothing to do with Metallica! Basic okay european modern power metal. So more like Edguy, Iron Savior etc."
5,The gold standard,"This book is an indispensible source of straightforward description of qualitative MO theory for any organic, organometallic, coordination, or materials chemist who uses MO theory. As a professor, I use it for my graduate class in inorganic chemistry regularly."
1,Boring,"I bought this book based upon all the readers' reviews. I love Russian culture and thought this book would be great to read. I forgot to read the Editor's review which says ""...much of the book is plain boring..."" And I totally agree. I found a little bit interesting but in the 850 pages there really isn't enough worth buying or reading this book. I would find another book about this subject if I were you."
3,A Good Read.....But...,"The first 30 or so pages will really get you going. There were no heated conflicts between Delia and Marcus, which could lead the reader to anticipate rough waters ahead (nothing in life is too good to be true, anyway) and expect something exciting. However, along the way the story fizzled out. The consequence of the memory loss sustained by Marcus was just not believable. The plot was good, though, it had a small twist that one could guess from the get go."
3,On the fence about this one,"I am not sure how I feel about this book other than I don't absolutely hate it or love it.Most of the story happens at the beginning and then just drags on. The champion quilting thing was a bit much...guess Ms. Palmer needed something to make the gangster hero seem gentle. I didn't like how Marcus didn't want kids (at least not right then) but wasn't as cautious as he should have been. After Marcus got his memory back, he showed an abundance of emtion that made the story better to me. I do wish DP would throw away her cookie cutter characters though."
4,texan lovers,"I'm Melini from Indonesia. I love Diana Palmer's books. Texan lovers is the first book that encourage me to read english book. I read it using dictionary.In Texan Lovers, you will smile, laugh and cry. But, i just want to say Diana Palmer books always typical. You read every story with different name but the same character. What i mean that every story have the same typical story. The man always big, handsome, rough and very 'experience' also a little bit old. The woman always young, fragile and alwaysss virgiiiin also have a big crush for the man. But i always waiting for the next Diana Palmer's book."
4,Interesting personal library book,"This is a nice book that compliments the Quiltmaker's Gift. The illustrations are wonderful, the story is okay. It has a great beginning, but then it seems to rush through to explain why the woman chose to live the way she did, which is the most important lesson in the book. Still, it is a nice story with excellent illustrations. I think I enjoyed it more than my child, though."
3,Some memorable footage,"I don't regret purchasing this dvd and have watched it several times. Unfortunately the commentary on most wildlife films ranges from insipidly trite to downright annoying - this seems criminal, given the quality of the movie footage and the tribulation involved in capturing it. On this one the monologue is mostly innoffensive.Although the quality during the introduction has the appearance of an old video, the rest of the film is fine. While not in the same league as, say, Derek & Beverey Joubert, there is some memorable and engaging footage in places and I will certainly be watching it again."
3,SO SO,"NOT ALL THAT GREAT QUALITY, I PLAYED IN ONE MY PLAYSTATION 3 & IT IS VERY POOR QUALITY DVD. i THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WITH THE PLAYSTATION 3 BUT IT WAS TH DVD EVERYTHING ELSE PLAYED CLEAR & SMOOTH."
4,Encyclopedia of Witchcraft,"Encyclopedia of Witchcraft By: Raven Grimassi Llewellyn Publications, (2000). ISBN: 1-56718-257-7The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft is a beautifully illustrated guide on Ancient and Modern witchcraft. It is easy to read and you can quickly thumb through to gain information on a wealth of subject matters. I was particularly pleased that it was written from a magical perspective and covered such topics as: Theology, History, Ritual Objects, Tools, Rites and Invocations. I did however think that the biography section could have been written much better and should have included many more influential practitioners both past and present. Overall, it is a wonderful work and reference tool that has been long overdue."
3,Informative...,"Althought this is a helpful book with mostly accurate information, it is heavily biased by Llewelyn. Some information might have been slightly altered by the editor (assuming Llew has one!), like some of the biographys of mostly Llewelyns authors. It does contain some VERY good information, and definetly deserves a warm spot on any Wiccans bookshelf."
2,INCOMPLETE,"I very much enjoyed Mr. Grimassi's ""The Wiccan Mysteries"" and was looking forward to reading his ""Encyclopedia of Wicca and Witchcraft."" However, I was very disappointed to find very few of my favorite wiccan authors (i.e. Laurie Cabot, Gerina Dunwich, and other ""non-Llewellyns"") listed among this who's who of the witchcraft world. In my opinion, to be a definitive encyclopedia of wicca and witchcraft, ALL prominent members of the wiccan community should be included, and not just the ones who write books for Llewellyn. For a more better resource of pagan biographies, I would have to recommend Raymond Buckland's ""The Witch Book"" (Publisher: Visible Ink Press)."
1,Subjective Trash,"I thought this book was extremely subjective, showing the Craft from only a single perspective. I was quite disappointed to see some reputable people not even mentioned in the book, and yet there is a multi-page entry about the author alone. This book is apparently very self-serving of its writer. All these other pumped up reviews are either from the writer's lackeys or an uninformed audience."
5,An Amazing Work of Integrity! Bravo!,"Grimassi has done it again! An amazingly deep effort that represents our path for the first time as it truly is, not through the filters of a judeo-christian culture. I expect that this work will continue to be the source for our community.It is interesting, that people tend to skim Grimassi's books and then mis-represent what he presents. In his intro to this encyclopedia, he is very clear that some members of the Craft community chose not to be included in this effort. This has nothing to do with Grimassi or his publisher editorializing or censoring certain individuals or groups. This is (like the Craft) about the freedom of those individuals choosing not to participate. This does not take away from the awesome depth of this work and I appreciate Grimassi's integrity in being up-front about what is and is not included.Thank the Goddess that there is someone in the Craft community who truly seems to present his work from spirit rather than ego."
3,Sex and suspense but not enough of either,"An indifferent transfer. The story's point is that love conquers political betrayal. Just wish this were so.Robert Taylor and Elizabeth Taylor, especially Elizabeth are better in their parts than anyone has a right to expect. The story doesn't really work but well worth seeing for the subject matter. The reds are the bad guys. Never be done today. Although it would probably be done better. Too bad."
3,"Great to look at, difficult to listen to.","I purchased this movie because I had read about it, but had never seen it. The fact that it was made in England has a big impact on the overall look and sound of the film, when compared to American films of the same era. Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Taylor look great in the movie, the script is fair, and Elizabeth does a pretty fair job in her first adult role. Although it lacks the gloss of an MGM picture of the late 40s, Conspirator's greatest determent is its score. MGM scores during the late 40s have a distinctively lush sound, crisp and clear,and usually a major asset to the films for which they were created. Take for example The Yearling, Cass Timberlane, Madame Bovary, etc. This score sounds like a poorly recorded 78 of a symphony orchestra . . . which it is! It is incredibly bad, and it detracts from the movie in a major way. I enjoyed the film but the soundtrack almost ruined it for me."
2,QUEEN ELIZABETH,I was stunned when I saw this film two days ago... The production values are alarmingly low and the script let the stars down. Elizabeth Taylor- in her frist adult role - struggles valiantly - and succeeds... It`s a shame her privatelife overshadows her great past.... She is a method actress and her warmth and choices makes me proud of her. Miss Taylor has the gift of letting us think acting is the easiest profession in the world.I hail u the greatest movieactress of the last century:-)
4,An Excellent Watch!,"This watch is very appealing to the eye. It is an acceptable substitute to its Submariner counterpart without the 5-figure price tag. The face is more purple than blue, but this does not detract from the watch's elegance. When I went to a local jeweler to get the watch sized, he enthusiastically said, ""You just purchased an excellent watch!"" I am extremely happy with this purchase."
4,A little on the small side.,"I want to say that this is NOT a poor quality watch. I don't get all the complaints of poor quality with Invicta watches. I have several of them and haven't had the least problem with any of them. This watch is only $64 and while it certainly isn't on the level of a Tag or Rolex it is far above the quality of anything else out there in this price range. My only complaint about this watch is the size of the face. While I don't like the 'Mega face' trend watch makers are tending towards these days, this one is goes a little too far in the other direction. In fact when I opened the box I have to say I was a little shocked and thought I had ordered a women's watch by mistake. But if you can live with that this is a really great looking and well made watch for well under $100."
3,Very nice looking but not much quality,"My wife ordered me this watch for Christmas and I love the look of it but it quit working 6 months after I got it, had to have the battery replaced and it works off and on I constantly have to adjust the time. But with all that said it was a cheap watch so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,good for the money,"the watch looks really good, people think its a real gold watch....the watch is good for the money you paid.but the band is not a wide band its in the middle not too wide not too small."
5,Fun! Smart! Enjoyable,British shows are a bit different than American shows but they do a very good job with this show!Very close to an American TV show.Smart scripts and good acting and very enjoyable!This show lets you know just how dangerous the spy business is!
4,Another great season for MI-5,"This season was up the high standard set by the previous three in my opinion. The great things about this show are the British perspective and also the fact that no character seems sacred. On the other hand, the fact that no character is sacred is also a bit of a short comming. I would like to see a little bit more character continuity, but overall still a great show. Only the Brits would have an episode dreaming up a conspiracy within the British intelligence services to knock off Princess Di!"
5,Great season,"As always, MI-5 does not offer cheap thrills or gauranteed success of ""good"" over ""evil"". Almost all episodes remain complex and often morally ambiguous, with everybody paying the price."
5,Another great MI-5,"This is a great series: Well-written, great presentations, strong acting and very intelligent. Many controversial issues involved in the world of counterintelligence or the so-called ""War on Terror"" are addressed thoughtfully and with more balance than in shows heavy in propaganda (e.g. ""24"")."
3,"America, bad!! UK, good!","I have enjoyed the first few season of MI5. However, there seems to be a consistent theme running through it. America and the CIA suck, MI6 generally sucks, MI5 is good. Can't remember which episode but when London came within feet of being obliterated by a Thermal Nuclear Bomb, I was so relieved that a total of four MI5 agents, under the age of 30, two of which had never received any agent training, saved the world, so to speak. And, they were good looking with nonBritish teeth. Every time America is mentioned I know there is evil on the cusp. Kind of like our Law and Order. Every time a cross is prominently displayed in someone's apartment, you know who the murderer is."
4,A fine gift for yourself or a friend moving to Louisiana.,"This very short book lists names of places,rivers, bayous, and lakes in Louisiana. It givesthe origin and meaning of the name, and the native American tribe that it was derived from. If you live in or are moving to Louisiana you will enjoy this book; a great gift too. Mike Waldon"
5,Completely engrossing,"I've been following this series and this is the best yet! It has historic information as well as some very intense spell working advice. This one has changed my awareness of the world around me forever. I think this author gets better and better with every book she writes, and will be keeping an eye out for anything new from her!"
5,"Dangerous Games, dangerous loves","This was a great book. I loved the plot and all the romance! I would definitly recommend this book. If you like the Nancy and Frank angle, read the Last Resort or Secrets of the Nile. Keep writing Ms. Keene, the Nancy Drew and Hardy boys supermystery's are the best!"
2,No Squeak!,"When I first got this in the mail, the chick squeaked at a VERY low tone. However, shortly after Easter without being touched, it never squeaked. It is so little and just not worth the money. Luckily my infant daughter will never know the difference."
1,Guess she missed the lesson on charity,"By the middle of this book I found myself siding with Ms. Rosen's fundamentalist monsters. Why? Certainly not out of any respect for their fear-driven madness, but out of revulsion for the unrelenting snide tone of the author. Sure the stories border on the grotesque, but so does Ms. Rosen's smug self-righteousness. I'd say she has more in common with the Keswick staff than she realizes."
4,lol,hehe.. i went to that school..i think i might read it if i ever have the time...i didn't think it was bad most of the time.
3,Did she say lucky?,"I attended Keswick, from kindergarten through graduation. Yes, 13 achingly long years. And to think that my mother and siblings and I went without so many of life's necessities (i.e., pest control) just so my mother could afford the tuition. From the horrible movies of the ""tribulation"" (Distant Thunder and Image of the Beast), to the scanner at Publix being a tool of the devil (think 666, mark of the beast), to thinking the rapture had occurred when hearing an ambulance siren, to the boycott of 7-11. I do not recollect my years at Keswick with the same fondness or gratefulness as the author, but it was somewhat comforting to read this book and realize that others, at the time we shared these experiences, felt the same as I (even if we do differ now on our feelings in retrospect)."
5,weird and wonderful,"this is the first film by jean rollin that i saw and it really left an impression. i remember sitting there thinking ""wow!"" and then wanting to see it again because it was so mysterious and poetic. it's like a dream on film with it's unusual twists and weird and yet often beautiful moments."
4,A interesting french thriller,A Robbery that ends very badly is the violent start of the film Requiem and though it slows down it will keep the viewer guessing as to what will happen next and who is the puppet master. It can be quite violent at time so for those who don't take to violence stay clear. If your looking for a gothic thriller that has great locations good actors does'nt spare the claret then check Requiem out.
1,WARNING; DON'T BUY THIS TRASH,"I watched this movie the other day and all I can think is I CAN'T BELIEVE I BOUGHT THIS PIECE OF SH*T!! I've only seen one other Jean Rollin film before and it sucked, too. I was hoping that Requiem would be better, but it was WORSE. There's no plot in this movie, the imagery is pointless and unmoving, and the acting BLOWS. Jean Rollin, if you are an Amazon customer and are reading this, let me tell you that you SUUUUUUUUUUUUCK !!!!"
4,Daevid Allen - 'Guru Live Zero - Beauty The Basket Case' (Bananamoon Obscura) 4 1/2 stars,"Great CD compilation of 'live' tracks from various location in the states, 2002. Check out the trio of players - Daevid Allen - gliss guitar & vocals, Kawabata Makoto - guitar and long-time Acid Mothers member Cotton Casino - synthesizer & voices. Couldn't get enough of this import title - especially the three Gong-like tracks ""You Go On Yeah"", ""Psycho Delicate Hessianskin"" and ""Elastic Beaverzip Cadenze"". Also need to mention the out-standing Acid Mothers Temple-like ""Dread Lady Humanoid - The Return"". When will the madness stop? Hopefully, never! Highly recommended. No. 17 of a limited edition of twenty unreleased Daevid Allen recordings."
5,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Minnie's Bow-tique,My grand-kids ages one and four love the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse video's.The tape is a excellent learning tool. Great for Christmas!
2,damaged DVD,Something is wrong with this DVD. It doesn't have fastplay so I have to pick the episode I want each time and once the episode is over it will go back to playing the same episode over and over again. I buy lots of DVD's through amazon and I never had that problem before. It's annoying not to be able to play it all. Every 30 minutes I have to come and choose the next episode. Other then that the stories are cute- what else would you expect from a Mickey Clubhouse movie?
4,Mickey Mouse Scary?,"My two year old LOVES anything Mickey and Minnie Mouse so when this DVD came out, I immediately bought it for her. Little did I know it would terrify her! There is an episode where they are having a sleep over and hear scary noises in the night. I don't really think that it is toddler appropriate. My daughter watched it with two friends and I very quickly had 3 crying toddlers on my hands."
3,Minnie Mouse's show for Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,Another in the series of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse offerings. This one is up to the high standards of the earlier ones. Cute stories. The Bow-Tique story is probably aimed toward girls more than the boys.
5,Great Volleyball shoe!,My daughter plays Volleyball and is totally satisfied with her this pair of shoes. And as her mom I am totally satisfied with the price!!! The color is bright but goes perfectly with her team colors!! I recommend them!
5,Great Product,"received product in a timely fashion, the shoes were new and great quality. It was the first purchase I made from this merchant, I have made three more since then."
5,Not just frightening for women!,"As a male Sophomore in college reading this book I was thoroghly terrified! It is noted that this does not just happen to women, but to men as well. Many times after reading this book was I looking around my car before getting into it, just making sure Fran Nightingale wasn't lurking behind it! Genuinly frightening (moreso because its a true story) read for either gender!"
2,Great subject; horrid writing.,"I bought and read this book when it first came out, and promptly returned it to the publisher for a refund. It was riddled with misspellings, poor syntax, and bad punctuation. If the physician-author wrote the book that way, shame on her. If the publisher hired someone to proofread and edit this book, they failed miserably: these were the errors I'd expect to see from a third-grader; not someone who purportedly has at least a four-year college degree.If you're curious about this phenomenon, there are other, better-written books to be had."
3,Who Proofread This Book?,"As a school media specialist, I purchased this book to add to my lower reading level biographies. It is an easy, quick read with basic facts about the actor. However, I was appalled to see that Gandalf was spelled ""Gandolph"" on page 30! It made me question how many other errors are in the book, who proofreads these books (it is a very quick read, and I caught it right away) and if the author did his homework thoroughly. Elijah Wood is a very articulate individual who spent years working on Lord of the Rings, and I wonder what he would think about the casual treatment of such a famous character."
2,Saxon Goes To America,"Destiny was the very first Saxon album I purchased. And as such I have to admit to having a slight bias towards this album.The second song "" Where The Lightning Strikes "" was and still is one of my all time favorite songs. I love the guitar riffs and 80's style chorus.Of course when you start comparing this album with earlier and later material, is simply falls flat on its face like a mouse that decided that the cheese on the trap looked rather tasty.There are a few other tracks that stand out but as a whole this album is one to miss. Start your Saxon adventure with Denim and Leather or a couple of the newest releases as Saxon have blasted back into life recently."
1,Diappaointment,The only disappointment in the entire Saxon library. There are albums that truly need to be remastered on CD. This one should not have even made it to 8Track. This was a great example of how not to attract new fans.
1,"Too late, too late","Unfortunately, reality has caught up with Hitchins. What might have seemed thoughtful in July has been proved wrong in August.If you haven't read the book before, don't bother...unless you, knowing what you do, enjoy watching someone crawl farther and farther out on a limb."
2,Long On Rhetoric Short On Insight,I have heard Hitchens speak in a public forum and his anti-anything religious venom leaves him unable to understand anyone religiously motivated. He thinks of them as children incapable of rational thought and thus discounts them out of hand. Hence he will never understand Islam and what motivates the people in Iraq. He needs a healthy piece of humble pie before he goes anywhere or says anything about anybody. He comes off as extremely arrogant which turns many people off. This book reflects that mind set.
1,My personal view as an Iraqi,"If this person does not believe that this war was about oil, then he seriously needs a wake up call. How can anyone in their sound mind call this a liberation? When in history has an occupation liberated its occupied? What has this invasion brought? Nothing but the very same terror that the US is supposed to wage war against. It is sad that no one realizes that WAR is the biggest TERROR that any people can experience."
5,Intellectual Masterpiece,"For those individuals that believe Mr. Hitchens is ""dumb"" or ""stupid"" obviously don't know anything about him. This is one of his many books written through intellectual curiosity, truth, and historical facts. Mr. Hitchens does not spin the facts to suit his own methods, as many political writers do. Instead, he will quickly and effeciently analyze facts and thoroughly present his position.If you are interested in reading an intellectual analysis of Iraq and the build-up to war, read this book. Those idiots who haven't read Mr. Hitchens but continue to ridicule him have no justification for their illogical rantings."
1,Makes the Reader Blush,"Without doubt, Hitchens' worst book.It's a shame that such an incisive, and normally clear headed journalist and critic could have been so wrong about the war in Iraq.None the less, it stands as an excellent example of how good people with the best of intentions can proudly support what becomes terrible evil.Doubtless millions of good decent Germans made the same sort of mistake from about 1930-1945."
3,A wholly different case,"Hitchens' tidy little book makes several different cases to support going (or now, our having gone) to war against Iraq. His arguments have merit and reveal a lot of information about the situation there that is new to me. It is clear that Mr. Hitchens has a lot of personal connections to people in Iraq and Kurdistan, and it is for those people that I believe he sought the end of the Saddam regime. BUT (and it's a mighty big but) the case he makes here is clearly not the same one the Bush administration made. That's pretty well supported by now, so I won't get into that. I do want to know why we weren't given a better, clearer view of the situation in Iraq by Rumsfeld, Cheney and Co. If it was a good cause, why did we need to be manipulated by phony WMD evidence? I hope Mr. Hitchens can address these questions in future writings of his. I may not be on his side, but I enjoyed his book."
3,outdated,"At this point, this book is of interest only to historians.Hitchens is a more than acceptable writer, but this thing is as out of date as Windows 95. It was published in April, 2003, a month after George Bush II invaded Iraq. The last essay is dated April 16th of that year.Yeah, it's basically an anthology of Hitchens's writing (culled from various periodicals, such as Slate, the Atlantic Monthly, etc.) about the then-new Iraq war around that time. The title is a little prescient, since it wasn't till long after April 2003 that the war started bogging down.Yet so much has changed since then that Hitchens's remarks now seem wide of the mark.Like I said, at this point it's useful only for historians for furnishing evidence for how the war was thought of before it became a quagmire.If you're looking for insight, by this point you've got to go elsewhere."
2,Nothing to brag about...,"I actually switched grad school courses because I wanted to read this book, but I was actually disappointed. The main (and most important) point of this book was missed: the dialect in African American communities differs tremendously from location to location. There are accent situations in St. Louis (the emphasis in the 'r' when speaking) versus Chicago (the lack of the 'r' when speaking) among black people. When meeting people from New York, there's an ""ah"" quality in the pronunciation in words. Format is different as well. Without the location differences, this book lumps all black people into one talking category and lacks credibility. On top of that, it went on far too long in overanalyzing the 'be' in vernacular, which is not as apparent in northern cities as much as in southern states. I wish the authors would've interviewed more black people from different regions (and different classes) before writing this book."
3,a good comedy,"I can't say it is the best of Benny Hill in my opinion, but that's only my opinion.... the biggest problem is the quality of the picture... not so good."
2,Not Benny's Best,"I've been a big Benny Hill fan for years, but I was disappointed in this video. I can't believe anyone would call some of these skits ""the best of"". Sure, there are laughs, but not as often as I would expect in a collection of this sort. There are some typical sexy scenes of women in revealing outfits, but that wasn't enough to make me want to try any of the other tapes in this series."
2,May not be the best of Benny HIll,"There is so much of Benny around, the best becomes a judgment call. I would choose differently."
4,benny's the man,I love Benny Hill. This dvd features alot of the older skits I never saw. They were very fun. Like I said Benny's the man.
2,"Hilarious content, but terrible transfer","This DVD from Anchor Bay is somewhat of an aberation from their usual quality product. The picture is on a level with a worn VHS tape. Maybe this is as good as the source material gets, but I tend to doubt it."
3,Not the best bits but still funny,"There really is no such thing as ""bad"" Benny Hill skits, but his earlier skits are far superior to what's on this DVD. A few gems such as the hospital sketch and ""throw open your window"" are scattered between other material that you can either take or leave. The transfer from Anchor Bay is excellent, and though lacking in bonus materials it's a decent disc for the price.Aficionados of the naughty ol' man will enjoy this disc, but newcomers to Benny Hill may want to catch re-runs on PBS before buying this. It's not the Best of Benny Hill, it's merely good."
2,Review of Best of Benny Hill,"This was purchased for my husband because we were great fans of Benny Hill when his shows were on TV in the 1970's and 1980's. When we viewed this DVD, we were very disappointed in the content. Most of the skits were very obscure. It contained only one or two of his best quality work. It definitely was a far cry from being the ""Best"" of Benny Hill. As a matter of fact, if it were possible, we would like to get a refund for this item. It didn't come close to being as advertised.Thank you for asking."
3,well will do,"I grew up watching Benny Hill comedy I can honestly say I was slightly disappointed with this dvd, it said ""the best of benny hill"", ""some of the best"",would have been a bit more appropriate. But, it is still funny and I am happy to have it nonetheless."
1,Stupid,"As an Englishman, it's hard for me to explain the popularity of Benny Hill in the USA without being very rude about the American people--which I have no wish to do. But look--what is so funny about this oafish, ridiculous little man? Chaplin, he's not. In England, Benny Hill was broadcast on the stupidest channel and watched by the stupidest element of the population. If you think that's you, be my guest."
1,The most boring of Benny Hill,"...would have been a more appropriate title. Having watched the TV series in the 80s with much delight and pleasure, I was appalled and very disappointed what I watched on this DVD. Whoever was responsible to make this selection, deserves to be awarded with the order of ""Humorless Bore"". But, hey, if you need something to exercise your yawn muscles with, this is the right movie for you. I have given it one star, because it is not possible to select a zero. My final comment - a total waste of time and money."
1,Definitely not the Best,"Only 1/8 of this CD was worth watching. The major portion of this CD was not funny. Some of the video had a washed out look as if from old tapes gone bad and the audio was not good in sections.With all the good shows Benny Hill did, it is hard to imagine putting out a DVD with consistantly mediocre material."
1,"Horrible picture quality, but great contents!",I had VHS version with the same contents as this DVD. I decided to buy this dvd expecting to have better picture and some extras.These are my truly technical comments about this DVD: 1) No extra features! No subtitles at all! If a trailer is an extra then I'm wrong here. 2) Picture quality is really poor. It's so bad that my VHS version plays with much better picture quality than this DVD. (DVD Player is not the problem as it works fine with the rest of my DVD collection). Probably I will just throw it out and stay with VHS version. :(Contents of this disk is great!
5,CLASS A PERVERT!,"Benny Hill's ""best of"" DVD is a skit classic, Benny's play on words is probably what I love the most about his comedy and that talent is very apperent in his Garden of Love song, it is classic Benny Hill and my favorite part of this classic comedy DVD. Maybe not worth buying, but definitely worth watching."
5,About Eldar,"Eldar Gaurdians form the backbone of any Eldar army. Though they are not as strong as their dark bretheren, they do have more shots then them. The amount of Gaurdians you get depends on what craftworld you get. This is not very durable if you use reg glue, you have to use polystrene cement or superglue. It might be sold here at amazon. All in all, if you want an Eldar army, always get Gaurdians first.(unless you are feilding a Lyandan Craftworld, they have Wraith gaurd as troops)"
1,Broke after 2 months,I used the roaster no more than 10 times in 2 months and it broke. I had to return the old one and order new.
4,good book,"a really good book about weight training, with specific drills for volleyboll. I have already increased my jumping and endurance."
5,"""Speech Science"" the best primer is updated","This text has, for the past 10 years, been the best and most prestigious of introductory books in our field. It is a fine lead-in for students wondering how speech is constructed. A follow-on for the more advanced student is my ""Acoustics of Speech Communication: Fundamentals, Speech Perception Theory and Technology"" 1999, Allyn and Bacon. J.M. Pickett"
2,Not the best,"I wouldn't recommend this textbook for a couple of reasons:1. It is not an easy read- -Since acoustics is not the easiest topic to learn about, one should look into a textbook that better explains the information in a simpler way that will benefit more students.2. I was told to purchase this textbook for a university level acoustics course and out of the entire class, not one student seems to enjoy reading the textbook, nor seems to understand the information clearly.I'm unsure about the other acoustic textbooks that are available out there, but I hope that there is a better one for students because this one is confusing and complicated- - also, I know many others that are not fans."
4,"Blender leaks, but Cuisinart will send replacement blade!",Cuisinart must have just had a bad batch of these blenders because mine also leaked initially. I called Cuisinart and asked them to send me a new blade assembly. They sent it out immediately through UPS. It arrived in 2 days! The blender does not leak anymore after putting in the new blade assembly--works great!
2,"Loud, leaky, and lumpy","I don't know what kinds of horrible blenders the other reviewers had before buying this Cuisinart, but this model could only live up to quite low expectations.I was impressed at first with this model. Good, solid, heft. Nice glass pitcher, wide mouth and base, and plenty of speed/power options. And, it all comes apart for thorough cleaning.But, when making smoothies, it would leave big frozen lumps. And the wide mouth doesn't have much of a spout, so lumpy smoothies or soups don't pour well and drip down the side. Plus, it seemed un-usually loud at any setting. Within a few months, it started leaking. I traced the leak to a hair-width crack in the blade housing, which quickly became a total failure. The blade is now in two separate pieces.[...]"
1,Don't bother,"I purchased this blender based on the reviews I saw. I found this blender to be loud and very slow! I replaced my old cheap Hamilton Beach blender with this Cuisinart and it's actually worse than the old blender I had. I would not recommend this blender if you are a serious cook. I had a hard time making pestos, chutneys, and olive spreads with this blender. Not to mention, this blender is extremely loud. I would not recommend this blender at all."
5,Better than many others,"My blender has to be tough, since I grind horseradish with it every year,spring through the first freeze in the late fall. My new Cuisinart is tougher and more powerful than any blender I've ever owned. The glass container is a major plus. It crushes ice like nobody's business, yet, on the lowest setting it is able to stir gently. Great buy for the money."
1,Product malfunction out of the box!,"The blender leaked out of the box... a poor trait in a *blender*. Milk was poured in for a smoothie and dribbled right out the other end, all over the counter and the base of the unit--after assembly instructions were *carefully* followed.This ""quality"" product obviously isn't."
1,Don't buy this blender......,"I decided to replace my 20-plus year old blender with this modern piece of equipment. BIG MISTAKE!! I had only used it a handful of times before it died on me. The motor just hums now when it's ""on"". Needless to say, I will pay more attention to the negative reviews in the future. I'm also disappointed in Cuisinart since their products are ususally of good quality."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I had this blender for about a year. The rubber feet kept coming off, so I ended up taking them all off. Lid is hard to put on. The speed control in the front is meaningless. It does not do anything. So you ended up holding the middle speed button with one hand and the blender with the other. You can not leave it and do something else. Then it started leaking and I found the plastic shaft for the blades had cracked. So in the trash it goes. DO NOT waste your money on this product!"
5,Hit the price-performance sweet spot,"This is a fine, basic blender. It doesn't have a flashy design (basic black), and it has the requisite glass pitcher. The mouth is wide, the pitcher short (good for stability.) The blades are sharp enough to chop cold beef for hash. The controls have an ice pulse button which works for short pulsing anything. At the price point, this blender beat many others much more expensive. It's a bit plain in looks, but it sure does the job."
5,Great blender,"I've been using this blender for a few weeks now, and it's a pleasure to use! I make a daily smoothie using frozen fruit, which it handles with ease. I don't usually crush ice, but I did a test batch just to see if it worked well, which it did. I especially like that the base which screws onto the container is broad and shaped to match the lower part of the blender, so it is very stable in use. The one piece glass jar is easy to clean & looks better than the plastic ones some other inexpensive blenders have. The speed control is just a knob which you turn up or down as you are blending, which I find to be intuitive & easy.It seems to be on the noisy side at top speed. I rest a hand on the top to calm it down if I'm using ""high"". I find that it blends everything just great at low to middle speed, so I usually just stay in that range.--I'm adding this comment after 5 months of daily use. The blender keeps on doing what it is supposed to, day after day..."
2,Crash and Burn,"I've had this blender for several months. The selling point was the ice crush feature. I make a lot of smoothies and throughly crushing ice was key. I loved it for a few months. But then..it burned out. It started shaking and I always had to push my hand down on the lid to keep it from shaking. Then it started leaking, not from the rubber gasket, but from the blade. Liquid slipped through and after blending, I would pour my smoothie only to notice that the liquid mixed with the motor and black liquid leaked all over. So, my $40 blender lasted 6 months. I alway thought cuisinart was the best....but I think I will try another."
3,Cuisinart Smart Power 18 Speed Blenders,"Compare the reviews on this blender with the reviews on the White version, Model CB-18. The only difference is color and that does not explain the wildly different opinions of the blenders. My opinion of the reviews has been degraded by a long way!!!!"
1,Gross,"Top kept coming off. Numerous times I would have HUGE messes to clean up from milkshakes & the likes splashing all over. Not to mention, the dog got to lick some of it. This product was so loud I had to warn the family before turning it on. They complain when I say I need to use the blender. We went from Blender all the time - Blenderific family to Anti Blender.Gross Product, don't buy it. If you are training to get on the floor and mop away, or indure loud sounds, this is perfect for you. For my family, this is just about the worst thing we've ever wasted our money on.Don't get me started with this horrible product!!!!"
2,It leaks,"I got this blender y'day, i tested and it started leaking, a huge disappointment, Amazon is giving a replacement, but it was not expected from a brand like cuisinart.I got the replacement and it leaks"
1,A Disappointment,"Three months after purchase, we can no longer use this blender. The first month, the clear plastic in the lid shattered. Last week the base with the blending blades cracked. Now the liquid seeps out and drips into the motor."
1,Defective from Day One,"The Cuisinart SmartPower Basics 18-Speed Blender proved defective right out of the box. Although I precisely followed the instructions for initial assembly and washing, the motor emitted a burning stench. My wife and daughters walked into the kitchen holding their noses. This blender truly stinks!"
1,It died...after two months!,Just when my husband and I were getting used to making the best concoctions together the darn thing broke! That metal piece at the bottom that spins cracked into two pieces. It's just sitting on the counter waiting for it's new piece. I have no idea where to go to get that piece and I'm wondering if I still have warranty on it. Wish me good luck!
1,Huge Disappointment,"After having the same problem as a previous reviewer (the blender I got leaked profusely), Amazon replaced it without question (probably a known problem?). Well, the replacement was used approximately 5-10 times in about 2 months and now it doesn't work. You hit any of the buttons and it just hums. When it worked, it did seem very powerful, but 2 months of service is unacceptable. I'm just glad I didn't spend more than $40."
5,Very Good Resource,"This was a very good, easy to read book. It was very interesting and I am intersted in learning more about the topic."
1,"""POOR"" Print Quality!","I am extremely disappointed in the print quality of this book. The pages are off center, and the type is smeared and hard to read. I'd like to know what I paid $23.52 for. My 11 year old grandson could have did a better job at producing a copy of this book by printing it off the webpage. How come the ""Click to LOOK INSIDE"" doesn't show how shoddy the print really is? It is really a misrepresentation. I will never order another book from this printer (Kessinger Publishings)!Sincerely,DAK"
3,"Ladies, release your girdles and breath!","This little book is probably of more historic interest than practical help. It is an author-discovered method for activating the third Chakra, written for a victorian readership. As such it is littered with quaint inaccuracies, but rather amusing. It also contains some timeless advice on cultivating vitality and grace. Recommended for those with an interest in Kundalini Yoga and health, but if you are seeking to rebuild your health or create a spiritual practise you might find contemporary books more helpful."
2,"""Going Potty"" - the not very interesting interactive book","We have Bear tapes, cd's and books. We LOVE Bear, but we don't love this book. The story line is very specific but not anywhere as good as the plot in the TV episode ""Potty Time"".First, the flaps are uninteresting. In one Ojo merely moves her hands to her crotch (one supposes to indicate that she has to 'go'. And in another, Ojo holds Snowbear up higher. Boring for me and my 2 year old daughter. [There is also a pull tab which in one case lowers a stool to the ground, and in another lengthens TP hanging off a roll. Wow!]Second, where there is innovation, it is difficult to use. There is a wheel which makes it look as if water is running in a toilet & in a sink where Ojo is washing her hands- the mechanism is difficult to use, even for me.Perhaps this is book is just age inappropriate for us....Pam T~mom and reviewer at BooksForKids-reviews"
2,Beware,This lock allows you to open the door from the locked position. If you go out and shut the door the door remains locked and if you do not have the key you are locked out. I would not buy this lock.
4,It's hardly techno or hip hop,"This is another album of the Hieronimus era and, as such, it's very different from those of the classic Popol Vuh era and not quite as brilliant. It's however as fresh as anything else from Florian Fricke and very pleasant. Hardly techno and hip-hop."
3,Meh....,"MEGALODON is a so-so monster movie that starts out badly, but starts getting better once the titular giant shark finally shows up. Unfortunatly, the titular giant shark shows up when about 60% of the film is already over. A drilling operation in the arctic ocean releases a giant prehistoric shark. Check it out if you get bored one day and need to kill some time."
3,ENJOYABLE B MOVIE! GOOD CGI SHARK!,"Ok ok...it's not JAWS! Hell it isn't even JAWS 2! However it was a short fun movie with a good plot and an excellent CGI shark. What you need to expect is some bad acting by some, mixed with good acting by others. My biggest dissapointment was how little the shark is in the movie. It appears halfway through but when it does the movie is alot of fun."
3,I've seen clips,"When I heard the name Megalodon I was excited. I've seen clips of this movie on Youtube.com and i'm like wheres the blood? I have to admit the shark looks good but I dont see any blood. The scene where that guys jumps in the water and Megalodon eats him, there wasn't any blood. When those people were in that raft and got eaten there wasnt anything gore."
1,Horrible Flop,This movie is a cut rate crappy film with no true plot. You barely see the shark and they keep calling the shark Megladon. The acting is bad and there is no reason to watch this movie. The movie will probably make you lose brain cells. Don't waste your time or money on this film.
3,MEGA CRAP FOR FIRST HALF,"I tell ya, Ive been waiting for this movie to come out well over a year (Funny was suppose to come out way back when but happened to uh never make it..now I know why) and to watch and be disappointed. Im not telling the story for whats the point..And if your like me...I get upset if someone tells me what happens in the film and then I dont want to watch. So heres a straight to the point telling of this film. Acting was very mediocre in this film. Some parts were interesting...but overall sucked. Now ALL of the cgi in this movie rocked. Pretty nice representation of MEGALODON...that is when you finally got to see it...After it finally showed it it wasnt bad. But it took almost half the movie to see it. Nuff said..if you can...just rent this movie...I learned the hard way.. :("
3,It's no Jaws or Deep Blue Sea but....,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer for the most part. It's really a shame the MEG film hasn't been made yet. Steve Alten's third MEG novel PRIMAL WATERS came out this week and what should have been the Jaws type franchise of the 21st century seems to be in perpetual turn-a-round due to these mediocre low budget films beating it to production.MEGALODON is better than most of the other Shark Movies out there,RED WATER,DARK WATERS, and the bottom of the barrel SHARK ATTACK Series 1-3(Megalodon). Curiously even those not about Carcharodon megalodon seem to be titled similarly to the third novel. I doubt it's coincidence."
2,Disappointing,"This is a nice looking watch and substantial in weight and features. However I have been unhappy with its reliability and it is not water resistant. I took it swimming in 4 feet of water and it leaked badly. Even before that the timer didn't consistently reset back to the starting point. Very disappointing for a ""quality"" brand like Acutron."
2,not reliable,"Lets face it, we buy a watch to tell the time! This watch has had so many returns it was actually replaced under their ""fixed 3 times within a year"" it gets replaced policy. In other words, it has spent more time in the mail and on their work bench than on my wrist. I do not abuse it or subject it to extreme envirorments unless the shower or dresser top is extreme. Will not buy another watch by this manufacturer again period."
1,Disappointed,"Marcel Khalife is one of the most interesting singer and Oud players in the Arab world. I knew him more than 15 years ago and I was listening to his songs since secondary school. He's just great.Unfortunately, I'm profoundly disappointed with this DVD. I thought that I will have a lot of his songs he sung all over the world, but I was surprised to see that all the movie is about his suffer and hard live, and all songs are truncated, so I did not enjoy as it should this DVD.Hafid."
5,Love it,Yummy! I add it with a bit of heavy cream or half and half. It keeps me in ketosis so that I continue to lose weight!!!
5,Great Blues music.,This was recommended to me because I love Blues music and couls listen to it all day/night long. I am from kansas City and often visit Blues / Jazz clubs and festivals. This is defintely Blues all the way through.
3,STICK TO YOUR STRENGTHS!!,THIS IS A GOOD CD AT BEST. THE SELECTIONS THAT FEATURE THE ACOUSTIC GUITAR ARE BY FAR THE SUPERIOR ONES. THERE IS NO NEED FOR HER TO ATTEMPT HIP-HOP FLAVORED TUNES...IT'S NOT IN HER! MY ADVICE TO TOSHI IS TO BE YOURSELF AND LET GOD DO THE REST. HE GAVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED!
5,A great book to read!,"I found that I sat down with the book once, and I didn't want to put it down. I've read it 3 times so far, and I know I will read it many more. If you want a book that has a great storyline and characters, this is the book to read. Also, if you want to read about the rest of Maddy's family, (sisters and brother) you should read Without a Trace, The Last Honest Woman, and Skin Deep."
3,"Dance for your supper, cry for your love..","I wasn't all together thrilled by this book but it was good. I loved how Nora Roberts throws the readers into the world of dance...and she doesn't describe the dance moves but then again she does. She shows us that the world of dance is anything but glitter and glitz, it's hard work and long hours. It's your life. I liked the romance aspect of it, and I loved Take It Off, but Reed...damn. He was dead from the waist up. He never truly admits to loving Maddy till the end which is frustrating....and Maddy, who claims to be strong, turns into a weeping little kid the moment she ""falls in love""...not to mention that what his mom did to him was exactly that...his mom. And he takes it out on the entire female race. Anway, good book but I wouldn't read it again. I love romance novels, but somehow, when I read the last page I was left feeling empty...to me, thats not a good sign. Read it, enjoy it, but don't expect Gone with the Wind kind of love..BW~"
4,O'Hurley Saga Continues,"DANCE TO THE PIPER is the continuance of the O'Hurley saga and focuses on Maddie O'Hurley - one of the talented triplets who becomes a Broadway icon. Even as a child Maddie was a graceful dancer who could learn new routines at the drop of a hat (as seen with a few well placed flash backs and remembrance scenes in this book). A guest appearance from Frank O'Hurley, the patriarch of the talented family and a flamboyant character himself, shows us that his goal has always been to enjoy life and live vicariously through the fame of his children. His appearances are always a welcome detour from the main plot.In the typical genre of romance books, this love story is far from a smooth ride but is an enjoyable journey along a bumpy road filled with characters you'll never forget. Unfortunately, the story line is not as unforgettable as those in it!"
4,love this family,"after reading all of the books about this family, i feel as though im part of it. this was a good book! i really like father/son secret as it explained a lot about his actions/reactions. until that point, i really didnt like this male persona. it was almost a first but once again, Ms. Roberts pulls it off ::smile"
3,The Piper review,"The story was good but I didn't enjoy it as much as I did, The Last Honest Woman, I think the problem for me with the sequels to the first story they about a more glamorous world, the first was more human."
3,start of the capitalism,the book concerns about the two main point of the last 5 centuries: religion and capitalism. they are together and separate.read it
4,Winners And Sinners (1983),"JACKIE IS NOT THE STAR! This film is silly but nice silly, you know? It is about a group of ex-cons who try to go clean after being released from prison."
2,It was not that great,"I do not see what is so great about the movie. The best part of the film was the roller skating sequence. There was barely any fight scenes, I like Sammo Hung, but he did not fight that much eaither.I would put this film in my top 30. But still it is worth waching. I also did not find the film funny at all."
3,"great action, not that funny",This movie had some great stunts and fights. especialy the ones with jackie. I didnt like the humor it was just immature.
3,Great old Jackie Chan Flick,"I am a new Jackie Chan fan, and I still enjoyed this film. Sammo Hung, and his gang of ex-cons/house cleaners are very funny. The background music also reminds me of a Chinese street performance. There are a few good stunts, and good fight scenes in the film, but don't expect great action. It was made in the 1980's, and it is obviously old. This film is much more humor, and less action. Jackie Chan only has a small role as a cop, but his scenes are good."
4,A fun movie,"Not so much a Jackie Chan movie, but still a fun movie that anybody will enjoy. Some good fights and great stunts by Chan."
2,Not much Chan in this one!,"I didn't care that much for this film--I checked it out to seea Jackie Chan movie, but he's not really in this one that much,although the two longer scenes he is in are good ones, and generally the fight scenes are pretty entertaining. However, the humor in this one seemed moronic to me, and there was SOOOO much of it! But if you really like Sammo Hung and his sense of humor, you'll love it."
1,Oh Lord...,"...this was a waste of time, plastic and studio hours, really. Pilar, you can do better, girl!!***Oh Dios... esto fue un gasto de tiempo, plástico y horas de grabación, en verdad. Pilar, puedes hacerlo mejor, mija!!"
1,Shame on you ! if you buy this Horrible CD!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't you dare waste your money like my self, on this ridiculous CD, she's not Puerto Rican , she can't sing !!!!Please buy real regeeaton, not this marketing joke !!"
5,This thing is amazing,"I was a little suspicious when i first saw this on Amazon, but i ordered it because the doctor said i needed to stretch because i have a herniated lower back disc. Im in my 30's and thought i knew how to stretch, but i realized i wasnt doing it right and was just hurting myself more. I have been using this every other day, and it really works. It helps to stretchcorrectly and maximizes the stretch by forcing you to go a little further than you possibly could on your own. Its like someone is helping you stretch. I absolutely reccomend this."
4,Simple but effective,"It's the right tool for the job. Other than the fact that some assembly bolts were missing, this has been a good purchase. The simplicity of the device is key. And the chart of stretches is extremely helpful. It has already helped increase flexibility in my low back and ham strings."
2,Just a model now,"This phone looks awesome. It's exactly what I want on my desk when I need to make a call. Too bad it doesn't work as a phone after the warranty period. Developed a loud buzzing sound on the line that was audible to both parties. Hooked old phone back up and it went away, so it wasn't the line. Looks nice over on my shelf, but that's not what I bought it for."
1,AMAZON YOU TERRIBLE!,"MP3 download is taken from different sources. Tracks 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 are all from the louder, remastered best of from 2003, the other tracks are lower from the original CD tracks 1, 5, 9, 10. Does this bother anybody but me? And why does Amazon and itunes do this? The album is the same on itunes. Anyone with a ear can hear the loudness difference, thus it just ruins the album experience. If you source this album then source it all from the original.. So what if there is a best of remastered of the some of the songs.. This is is the second album I notice Mp3 downloads where the album is culled from different sources (INXS - Swing) see my reviews for more info.."
2,Stick to his work with Harlow.,"This album can be summed up it one word, disappointment. For those that have listened to Junior on ""Salsa"" and Hommy: A Latin Opera"", you would come to expect much more from him. First off, the sound quality is lackluster, as are the topics and lyrics chosen for the songs. The music is just uninspiring, along with the fact that it is short (7 tracks), it includes a merengue and bolero. The only songs worthy of mentioning are ""Doce Caravanas"" and ""Canto a Borinquen"" a nice jibaro like tribute to the motherland, a very typical Puerto Rican sound. This saves the album from a 1 star rating."
4,A well done beginning prolog book,"This book is a great introduction to learning prolog. I was learning prolog for neurolinguistics and AI applications. I have some facility with programming, python and C++, but am not a pro and it is not my day job by any means. I found this to be a very good basic introduction to prolog. There are a few typos, and a part on data structures where the commentary and the code it's on are switched. The book also loses pace and points and has to be plowed through. But on the whole, an excellent solid book to learn prolog a little."
4,The original Clocksin & Mellish book is now dated (surprise),"The Clocksin & Mellish book was once thedefinitive guide to Prolog, but is now fairlydated and of historical interest. As I understandit, Clocksin has updated the 1981 work several times"
2,I still say they suck,"Yeah Kiss takes a swipe at their detractors with the sarcastic cover, but then obliges the faithful with more excruciating forays into disco and mounds of cotton candy. My goodness how could a band so completely lose the plot after making history and winning two championships (that's two blockbuster live albums baby) in only three years? Maybe a case of not handling success because despite some great songs (as Gene says now: ""K-Tel records had great songs, doesn't matter."") everything about this: the cover, the content (I like ""Two Sides,"" ""Torpedo Girl,"" the reggae tinged ""Naked City"" and ""Is That You?"") just sticks out like a turd in a punch bowl; I'll never forget the agony when my bud Chris Jones told me his mom liked ""Shandi."" ""Back in Black,"" ""British Steel,"" ""Women and Children First,"" the first Iron Maiden, and ""Animal Magnetism"" all came out this same year and what we got was a parody of a Kiss record, that's right...parody."
4,Better than average,I like this album. It's no destroyer but it's a good album. Their albums after this were no good but this one is a keeper.
2,SILLY,"Gone was Peter but the band did no tell the pulbic about that at the time, when Anton Fig handled the drums in UNMASKED. The album is not a total waste at all, but is clearly one of KISS weakest efforts. It's not bad. It's almost impossible for musicians like Gene, Ace and Paul, aided by expert studio musicians and executives, to release something that ""Bad"". It's just not so great, that's all (but SHANDI must be praised as their worst song ever!!!0"
3,"Too much Ace, but some good tunes...","Ace is a poor vocalist at best. His lyrics are dreadful, but his musicianship is enjoyable. I'd like to see what Paul or Gene might have done with the music to Two Sides of A Coin or Talk To Me. Torpedo Girl is by far the biggest mistake KISS ever recorded. It's a joke, it's weak and although I've always applauded KISS for their experimentation THE BEACH BOYS is going to far! I especially enjoy Easy As It Seems and Naked City. Nostalgia adds an extra star to my rating of this CD. It's one of KISS' lowest points, but can be a fun listen."
1,KISS Neutered,"Why neutered? Because this CD doesn't have any balls. This is a very bad record and is the worst KISS album of them all, not counting the solos. None of these songs would have made it on any other KISS album. Talk to Me and Naked City are the only songs that I'd even consider as good as poor. The other disco-like songs are just dreadful. It is hard to believe that just 2 years earlier, this same bad delivered Love Gun. The only good thing about Unmasked is I now have 2 CDs I can have my kids listen to without being worried that I'm exposing them to harmful words or subject matter: Kiss Unmasked and the Chipmunks Movie Soundtrack. And yes, the Chipmunks CD is much better."
1,Embarrassing,"This album caused Kiss to lose most of their fan base for years and years. In fact, they never actually totally recovered after releasing this clunker. Its no wonder, this album is a total sell-out. Its Kiss trying to appeal to the 6 year olds and their parents that were coming to all their concerts and buying their toys. Its Kiss puking out a painfully drab hybrid of pop and disco. Basically its a disgusting blight not only on Kisstory but also on rock music in general.Recommended: Hotter Than Hell, Creatures of the Night"
4,An underestemated album.,"In my opinoin Unmasked is really an underestemated album. I think it has some rellay great songs from this era in time, I mean it was all about disco in those days and KISS made an effort to do a rock/pop/disco album and I think they did a great job. I dare you to listen to it again and tell me that ""Shandi"" isn't a totally awesome song with a touch of that summer feeling when you're cruiseing down the highway blasting the radio at full speed. And what about ""Talk To Me"" with the lust and dizzyness between a man and a woman;), and not to mention Gene's ""She So European"" with that whole world feel to it and women from another continent that speak with an accent;). Seriously this is an awesome album, so if you just sit down i that favourite chair give it a chance, I bet you'll find another great KISS album with a differnt touch to it."
2,Rock or Pop?,"I don't know what are they thinking about in the early 80. Kiss doing pop music?. Maybe Bon Jovi, Poisson, but Kiss???. Really I prefer other albums like ""Love Gun"", ""Rock and Roll Over"", ""Creatures of the Night"". There are only two good song: ""What makes the world go round?"" and Ace's ""Torpedo Girl"". Gene do nothing in this album (a disaster!). Buy this album only if you are a truly Kiss fans like me , otherwise don't miss your money!!"
2,Kiss - 'Unmasked' (Mercury) 2 1/2 stars,"Review no.95.Originally released in 1980,'Unmasked' was the 8th Kiss album.Certainly not their best work,but tolerable.In my humble opinion,it's simply too tame as well as just too commercial for my taste.That's not to say that some Kiss fans that haven't heard 'Unmasked' before wouldn't dig it.Remember hearing how this lp had quickly reached the 'gold record' status when it first came out,but then overnight dropped off the charts completely.Can see that drummer Anton Fig had filled in for Peter Criss.Anyway,some of the decent cuts here are ""Is That You?"",the lp's single ""Shandi"",""Tomorrow""(seem to recall a semi-lame video for this song),""Two Sides Of The Coin"" and ""Torpedo Girl"".A second-rate hard rock sellout catalog release.Purchase at your own risk."
2,Milquetoast Kiss,"After rocking the nation through a progression of solid rock and roll offerings such as ""Kiss"", ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Hotter Than Hell"", ""Alive"", ""Destroyer"", ""Rock and Roll Over"" and ""Love Gun"", the boys released ""Dynasty"", which was hit and miss. Then came ""Unmasked"". There are a couple of decent rockers on it, but not enough to placate the faithful. It's mostly middling pop and lite-rock. Of all their albums (make-up era), this one just might be the weakest. For the newbie, get the first six studio LP's and ""Alive"". Truly an excellent way to initiate oneself into the Kiss Army!!"
3,"Realism, If You Please.......","This looks like one of those CDs that people either love it or loathe it. I think KISS Unmasked falls somewhere in between the grey area. It's hardly KISS's best OR worst. (Actually, it's hardly KISS at all; most of the instrumental work comes from NON-KISS members).Taking it for what it's worth, it's an enjoyable CD. I think it stands up to some of KISS CDs released in the 80's. But let's be truthful; it has NOTHING on their 70's work.So there ya have it: a good albeit light weight CD and not essential. Anybody that tells you so is likely a die-hard fan, and as such, their opinion is too biased to give you honesty."
2,REALITY CHECK ON THIS CHEESEBALL BOMB,"People get a hold of yourselves! The four and five star reviews for UNMASKED are, frankly, an abuse of the Amazon.com review system. Look, a five-star album is STICKY FINGERS or REVOLVER or BORN TO RUN ... not a goofy slab of ear-candy from Kiss. Even if you have a sweet tooth for power-pop, UNMASKED is a cheeseball affair. Bands like Cheap Trick and the Babys could best this platter in their sleep. Heck, the Knack does superior work.I'm giving UNMASKED two stars only because Paul Stanley seems to be having such a good time crafting catchy, featherweight ditties like TOMORROW and WHAT MAKES THE WORLD AROUND. I could never take Paul seriously as a rocker after hearing him croon a goo-fest like SHANDI with such conviction, but you have to give him an A for effort. As for Gene, it took him years to get over this wacko play for the teeny-bopper crowd. Sometimes it seems he's still traumatized."
2,total sell out,first off by this time kiss had dropped peter criss and once again use anton fig too record this. also the type of sound on here is really just disco and by this time they were a kid band. its just okay its not really that good at all only for the kiss fan who needs everything by kiss but for most kiss fams steer away from this cd.
3,spoiled by an umistakeable 80's flavor,"Ok, I AM a diehard KISS fan, and a member of the KISS Army, but...even KISS has afew turkeys. When this came out I was waiting with baited breath, but I knew I was in trouble when the first single on the radio was SHANDI. While, its not a terrible song lyrically, execution is everything! That unmistakable electronic 80's production feel is prevellent through the whole album. The best songs on the album are 2 ACE Frehley tunes: Two sides of the coin, and Torpedo Girl(which is good only because it dose not take itself seriously...its for fun!) This is remarkable because ACE, while I admire his ability to play guitar; HE IS NOT KNOWN FOR HIS SONG WRITING ABILITY!( I am not trying to insult ACE, or his fans.) The only other cool thing about this album was the poster that came in the LP!"
1,It's Crap! That's all there is to it!,"They might as well just have took a dump in the record jacket and sealed it up for shipping. The stench of musical poo poo was evedent from the cover art, Kiss' attempt at humor. As the last frame of the cover comic confessed...(on this LP) They Stink! Why, oh, why is this album still in print? Have they no mercy? And why, oh. why, after so many years of being a rising force in the world of rock and roll would KISS allow this embarrassment of an LP to hit the market? It sucks, it blows, it stinks, it reeks, it deserves to be hidden away where no one can ever hear it again. Compared to UNMASKED, The ELDER sounds like Led Zeppelin II. And ALL KISS fans know how horrible the ELDER was. UNMASKED should surely go down in history as the ISHTAR of record albums."
1,I'd be ashamed to release this,"I wonder if the band listened to this album before they released it? I would hope that they didn't and that's why this abysmal album made it onto the market. It has comedic value, but I don't think that's the effect the band was going for. If this was the only Kiss album I had ever heard, I would never listen to them again."
1,Absolutely the Worst............Ever,"I own between 450 and 500 CD's. This is probably the worst of them all. I am a Kiss fan. I have every ""paint"" era album. This is painful to listen to. The only song worth checking out is the Ace song ""Two sides of the Coin"" I believe it's called. Words cannot describe how awful this album is so I'll stop now. Even Ace's songs on this album don't make it worth buying. But then again, if you are a fan you'll buy anything...that's how I ended up with this garbage."
2,Kiss lost there sound here.,"I bought this album when I was around 12 years and found it a little lame. O.K. a lot lame. Even as a kid I remember it was just a flat album. Peter Criss didn't drum a single damn beat on it and the Kiss sound was completely lost here. Fans of the original kick-ass fire breathing, stage smashing Kiss can just skip this one.It does have some nice preformances on it especially Ace and Paul. Pauls vocals are fab as always. But the whole Kiss thing was over."
3,BUBBLEGUM KISS,"I've always had a soft spot for this album. While far from the band's best, UNMASKED is still a worthy addition to the catalogue, if only for the beautiful ""Shandi"" and the catchy opening stomper, ""Is That You?"""
4,Polished and unapologetic,"I agree with those who love this album. It may sound strange, but I compare Unmasked to a modern version of early Beatles; as in everything up to and including Rubber Soul and Revolver. Think about it; simple and very melodic rock and roll with very strong and distinct verses, chorses, and bridges. In my opinion this is KISS' strongest pure musical offering. Gene's lyrics are somewhat sincere and are not seemingly written by a 9th grader with a constant boner living out his fantasies like ""Calling Dr. Love"" or ""Christine Sixteen"". It is four guys playing two guitars, a bass, and drums. When I listen to Unmasked, I DO NOT associate the album with disco glitter balls or The Bee Gees at all. I think the ""Disco"" label was something attached to the Unmasked by their haters. In my opinion, this is way more new wave and it came along before new wave really broke out...very innovative!"
5,UNMASK THIS ONE,"ONE OF KISS BEST ALBUMS, EVERY TRACK IS GREAT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE AWESOME SHM AUDIO FORMAT. MUST HAVE FOR ANY CD COLLECTION, BUT DON'T PAY THESE RIDICULOUS OVER-INFLATED RIP OFF PRICES, I BOUGHT MINE FROM THE MUSIC SPECIALIST ON E BAY, SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF CASH.CHEERS!"
2,good songs with poor production?,"Unmasked is far from one of Kiss' best albums. It's probably near the bottom and should be considered by diehard Kiss Army members only. However, it's not a total disaster. I think there are some good songs on here, but the production is horrible. It sounds like it was recorded in a tin can on the moon, and has such an ""80s processed"" sound it ruins the whole album. Can this be re-recorded or something?! Is That You is a very good Kiss song. Talk to Me is decent. I also like Naked City and Tomorrow. The rest is forgettable. This was obviously done when the band was in turmoil and half the members were half gone."
3,kisco disco,"after the 1979 hit with ""i was made for loving you"". i guess they wanted a whole album of disco hits. wanted to give this 2 stars, but as a KISS fan since 74 i couldn't. never liked gene's songs on this one. always felt that 3 great songs from the DEMON would have pulled this up to par. looking back 1980 was a good year for hard rock/metal,but not for kiss."
2,The cover is cool,"Wow what can you say this really sux! If you want to bother someone put this on.just plain and simple horrible!!! everything that could be wrong is wow just bad ,but it gets 2 stars because it's not as bad as the elder! whew 2 in a row just..."
2,The First Song Rocks! But.......,"Unfortunately it is straight down the dustpipe from there. I remember when I bought the original vinyl back in college. After the first listen, I put the lp back in the sleeve and it's been gathering dust there ever since. Virtually unlistenable when compared to any of the groups previous efforts. Why 2 stars instead of one? ""Ace Frehley lead guitar!"". The final nail in the coffin of the original KISS."
3,kiss unmasked era,this is a pretty good album its a little to disco though but that was kiss back then. buy this one if you have a lot of money to spend or you just want to collect all their albums. buy it if you our a old time kiss fan not recomended for people new to kiss. i used to like it a lot but now i dont like at much i still like it though so just buy it used or new.
4,GREAT ALBUM!!!,"I don't understand why is everybody (or almost) rating this album as a really bad album, and still has 40 REVIEWS!!!. Ironic, don't you think????? Well, to tell you the truth it's not the best KISS album, but they have 28 albums or so, What can you expect?. I don't think it's the worst KISS album. I really enjoy every now and then hearing songs like: Is that you?, Naked city, What make the world go around, Talk to me, etc.When your are listening to this album it really makes you think at what point of their career KISS were. You have to be a really big KISS fan to understand this album. You like KISS? Buy it. You like BON JOVI? Buy it. You like Def Leppard? Buy it. Otherwise, don't expect too much if your thinking in the ROCK'N'ROLL OVER album.Highpoint: Talk to meLowpoint: She's so european"
3,Pretty SHANDI,"I remember ""Shandi' on the Top 40 back in '80 when I was in high school. I thought it was a pretty tune; it gets short shrift from most Kiss fans."
4,Too mainstream for Kiss but still Kiss,"After ""Dynasty"" they had already lost legions of old fans, so because they had new fans know, I suppose they wanted to keep them and were lured into the continuation of pop rather than rock. They exploded in Australia after ""Unmasked"".Anyway, ""shandi"" is a good song, quite catchy and songs like ""Naked city"" and ""You're all that I want"" do have the same energy (even though it is played way slower) as ""pre - pop"" Kiss claasics like ""I stole your love"" or ""Christeen sixteen"".It is part of ""Kisstory"" and still has its highs."
2,What the??,"What are you doing? Are you thinking of buying this? It just better be to replace a copy in your collection if you are a Huge KISS nut like I am. Because this was the worst! Disco? Hey Dynasty had disco and was good. Music From The Elder had an enjoyable edge to it so, listening was kinda fun. This was just painful. Shandi? C'mon you can do better than that!"
1,Unmasked? you cant be serious...,"""Unmasked"" has got to be KISS's least creative album. It was clear in the music that there was unrest and finger pointing in the dressing rooms and in the studio. In fact, if I remember my KISStory right, Peter left the band during the production of Unmasked. I like the song ""Is that you?"" but other than that, I can see why the tape was a bargain bin favorite and had many birthdays in record stores. Please, people, If you want definitive KISS, pick up ""Hotter than hell"" IMO one of their best studio efforts"
1,KISS at Their Worst,This is just about the worst pop music I've ever heard. Any self-respecting rock fan will pass this one by.
5,Garmin City Navigator Europe,"I recently used this product in my Nuvi 360 for three weeks in Austria and Germany and found it highly accurate and the equal of the guide for the USA in terms of driving directions and POI's. It got us through the winding streets of Vienna, Munich and other towns and highways along the way with no problems. We were also in Budapest, though without a car, and it appeared to have a very complete map of that city. We found that the American English voice (Jill) butchered the pronunciation of German street names so switch to the German voice if you understand German. If you know no German (or other local languages as the case may be), then the American pronounciation will probably be useful in recognizing street names phonetically, and of course you will get the driving directions in English.The Garmin card has absolutely no instructions regarding how to boot it. You must insert the card, turn on the device, then go to Tools>Maps>Map Info and check the Europe Navigator."
2,Amazon sold me an obsolete product,"Garmin is great, but Amazon when I called to talk to them about getting the additional software for my Garmin I purchased at Christmas, they sold/sent me the DVD version which is not the correct item. You need the SD card version so it fits into the Garmin. I called Garmin and they walked me through on how to use the DVD. I had to go and buy a 2G card and then download the DVD and then transfer it to the card..and of course it didn't all fit on the card so I had to delete some countries..it was a mess..I couldn't return the DVD since I had already opened it. The product of the maps are great but Amazon should have known that the DVD version was obsolete and not sell it."
5,"This one's great, as is the entire series","My mom bought many of the books and DVDs in this series for my son, and he loves them all, far more than any other series like Baby Einstein, etc. Although simple, the videos calm him down, and he adores the puppets- this one by far is his favorite with the ducks, lions, Noah, etc. I'd also recommend God Made Music and the new Christmas one. We generally don't let him watch much TV, but when we do, it's one of the Babyfaith Videos, and the accompanying books are some of his favorites too (although at 14 months he is now starting to like the VeggieTales books as well). It's nice to expose him to the simple Bible stories they feature, and the background music is hymns (no singing, though, just music) so I'm usually humming along as well."
3,Kinda just like baby Einstein,"A little disappointed in this, it's very much like Baby Einstein...only with an added eerie-sounding woman saying ""God Loves You"" in between each segment. I would suggest this for infants up to maybe 18 months old."
5,A God-send,"This video is perfect for little ones 1-4 yrs. Our grandchildren call it the ""Bible"" video and sit glued to it for the entire 30 min. They never tire of the puppets and the colors. Their interest in this video allows me enough time to get a shower, cook dinner or sit and enjoy it with them. I never tire of it either! I have several of the Baby Faith series, all of them excellent..."
4,Hector's Golden Moment,"Lavoe's haunting memento to a lost relationship makes a reminder of humanity as we begin to listen to Periodico de ayer. A testament to a woman he no oonger loves, Lavoe relases the passion of a man who seemed to forsee his own death. Also reflecting this very idea, El Cantante expresses with the same haunting clarity what it is to sing to an audience, portraying felicity and happiness, all the while being torn up inside. The album is not all a reflection of sadness, El Todopoderoso is a homage to god, a pristine example of Lavoe's devotion to religion. The other two tracks I MUST mention on this album are party starters as well as classics. Rompe Saraguey is a romantic little tune that you can easily sway to, and get all the salsa dancers in the room all warmed up for the jamming Songoro Cosongo, which he sings in Eringonza, en Espan~ol o en Ingles......."
5,Learning to make rocks?,IF your learning to color rocks this is great. It showed me a lot. Well worth the price. I loved it. And it wasn't that badly priced.
4,it worked.,"I'd been struggling with my calling for years, never quite getting the right sound out of my call, even on the basic quack. But after listening and practicing along with the CD for a couple of weeks I finally sound like a duck."
2,Happy...not happy,"I am pleased with the overall color, description and price of these panels. However, the first time I ordered these, one of the panels was without a top hem so I had them replaced. Now, I have two new panels that are lopsided at the bottom. The bottom hem is on an angle and one of the panels is about three inches shorter than the other. So the price is right but is the inconvenience worth it? It is to me because curtains are so expensive, but it's still a pain."
4,Cheap price but really great curtains!,These curtains were so cheaply priced but I took a chance on them because I wanted an alternate for when I take my other ones down. I LOVE THEM!! They are a beautiful blue tone that reminds us of the sea. Very lightweight and sheer...yes one is longer than the other... but you get what you pay for after all. I love them.
2,ITS NOT BLUE!!!,"The color says SLATE as being BLUE, but its NOT BLUE, its green!!! So if you're looking for that pretty blue color that its showing that it claims it is, KEEP LOOKING, this is NOT IT. However if you are looking for a dark green grey with light blue shimmer, but OVERALL DARK GREY OLIVE GREEN, then this color is the one for you."
2,Careful of color,Quality of product is OK but I needed slate gray and these curtains are definitely not slate but light sage green.
2,"Worked for a while, and customer support was a pain","I ordered one of these for my kid last Christmas. It showed up quick, but the LCD screen was broken. I sent it back, and waited over a month for a new one, and had to make multiple phone calls to people with minimal English skills to make it happen. The unit itself worked ok for a while. The controls are funky, and it too easily switches to oriental characters so you cant decipher the screens. The headphones stink, but the sound was OK after replacing them with some more expensive ones. After about 9 months of use, the headphone jack crapped out, and now the sound only works in one channel. All in all, not worth it, especially for 256 lousy megabytes. Definitely buy a Sandisc Sansa. 8 gigs of flash, and it works fantastic, for only 175 bucks."
1,Don't work the item,"I am writing to complain about a item, in which the item don't work anymore before 3 days left.I believe that the provider will be change the item, but don't do anything, I want payback for that item or to change the product for another, I will pay for the shipping, but I need an answer as quickly as possible. The provider don't send me nothing.I would be very interested in knowing your comments regarding the above complaint.I look forward to hearing from you."
2,Found It,This isn't the worst vampire movie but it is dated. This movie does have the vampire levitated and impaled at the end.
5,Mars attacks!!,"In Mongolia we meet a man named Dog. He is riding around basically trying to make it in life. He meets a guy named Bynar who tells him the Martians have invaded and set up a wall to protect their conquered lands on earth, in an ironic twist of fate the old great wall of China has been incorporated into this ""World Wall."" The two then forge an alliance and vow to find out what is going on.I liked this book, this and the movie make a great edition to any sci-fi buffs collection. Whatever you do, don't miss the last 20 pages."
1,Skip this book unless you love words and have much time to waste,"This book has an enormous number of synonyms and antonyms. The problem is that the index is so tiny, it is rare you will find in it the word you want, or even one near to it. So you go on a hunt. Take the word ""primacy"". The nearest word in the index is ""prime"". But this is in the section on preparedness. So perhaps ""primary"", but this is not in the index. Try perhaps ""first"". There is much there, but nothing near ""primary"", and with no assurance that ""primacy"" will be anywhere nearby. By now you have read hundreds of words and are nowhere near the word you set out to find. I rarely find anything I'm looking for in this book. My advice is find an indexed thesaurus that has a large index. This one is only 43 pages long in a book over 900 pages."
3,"Decent reference, but strangely","This thesaurus would be good a reference for someone looking for alternate words to describe things in a horror story or maybe a murder mystery. It just seems geared towards things like that both in the way that it is organized, into descrite sections by subject, and the content that it contains. It is not the most complete thesaurus, however, and therefore may not be for everyone."
3,Fine Book,"This is a fine book. It is quite large however, and I was looking for a slightly smaller, pocket edition. I returned this product and the process went very smoothly. I got my credit within days."
2,Time consuming,Takes too long to find what I'm looking for.Waste time looking for word.Then you must find the section.Then choose one of words to continue your search.
1,Parents and Administrators BEWARE,"This thesaurus is very complete! It is filled with all today's current slang. There are 26 threads for the f-word, as well as, graphic sexual terms. It's unfortunate because the way that this book is set up is very useful, but it is not child appropriate at all. I was very disappointed."
5,INDEX-STLE THESAURUS!,"This is it! The thesaurus with an index that's almost half the book -- usually the word you need is right there in the index, without having to plod through several paragraphs or even pages. This thesaurus has the whole spectrum of language, from current slang to quaint old-fashioned expressions. Those who have been frustrated by a thesaurus ""in dictionary form"" will find this much more complete and easier to use."
5,The best thesaurus but what happened to the book?,This is the best thesaurus out there but what happened to the printing? The paper is now thicker and cheaper feeling. The binding looks substandard. The thumb indexing is now every two hundred sections rather than every one hundred. I prefer the feel of the older editions. Ths is too bulky and less attractive.
5,Love it,Radical departure from the Roget's of the past. Referencing is much more advanced and inclusive. I dig it!
4,Got what I wanted,"This just what I was after.Had an old one, but wanted a more up to date version,for the kids to use when they come here.Good reference book."
4,-One Of My Favorites-,"If I'm not using ""Merriam Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus,"" I am using this one. It's not as well laid out as some of the earlier versions, and it does take a little more time to find the words you are looking for, but I still like it and will always own/use a current copy. It's A Classic..."
4,Terrific edition -- but wish it had a smaller footprint or be available as an e-book,"Kipfer, the editor of this edition of the Thesaurus, is to be congratulated on putting together a terrific update to this title. I've been using the fourth edition since sometime after it first came out, which is to say the edition just prior to the HarperCollins take over of the title in 1992, and it has served me very well---in particular, it's handy size (6"" x 9"") that fits comfortably in the hand despite its girth. One can't quite say that about this new 7th edition, for it's approximately 7.5"" x 9.5"" and printed on heavier paper stock making it 25% thicker and perhaps as much as double the weight of the version I was using. And this newest edition has only half as many thumb indexes as does the fourth edition. But all that is styling. As for the content, this new edition is very good. What I'd really like is an e-book!"
4,Ok - but don't toss your Third Ed!,"After getting many years of excellent service from the 3rd Edition (bought new for $$$) I decided to 'upgraged' to 6th Edition. For the most part a great tool and highly recommended. Especially if you are new to a good thesaurus. HOWEVER - every silver lining has its cloud!The paper used for the pages appears to be a high grade newsprint. Probably is a bit better than that, but after the brilliant white, sensually-thin paper of the 3rd Edition, a bit of a dissapointment.The word lists: A real dissapointment! In the 3rd Edition index there were special entries when a pertinent word-list existed. Under COAL, there would be an entry ""Types of ~ 330.10"". Sadly this handy feature has been left out of the 6th Edition - you have to stumble across the word lists by luck.So my 3rd Ed. will remain a backup. I wasn't sure what to do with it anyway..."
2,Not a weekend crash course,"I bought this book based on the reviews and summary because it sounds like a book that a beginner could really learn from. But not so. I've made it to chapter four but I'm finding I can go on no longer. This book is basically straight text. There are no step by step lessons to demonstrate what the lesson is talking about. The book does provide some sample code, but it is presented as an example; you do not build it yourself. This book tells you what to do, but you don't get your hands dirty by actually writing codes yourself and then seeing what the code does.I will say this though. The text itself is well written and is readable enough, given the dry nature of the subject. But I do feel this is more of a reference book for beginners. I'm going to buy the Microsoft step-by-step book, then come back to this book.I'm giving it two stars simply because I do not believe this book is what it claims to be, a weekend crash course."
3,Missing exercises and examples,"I thought that the material was thought through and presented well. It fell short, in my opinion, because there weren't enough examples or any exercises to demonstrate how to apply the programming techniques to different situations within Excel.A workbook would be a great addition to this text."
4,Great Book,It took exactly a weekend for me to digest this book. The author's writing style is clear and the book was clearly well designed. You should write this from cover to cover and you'll get exactly what's you are promised to get: a course on Excel macro and excel programming.Good value for money.
1,"Poor examples, it tells you what to do and does not show you","This book is extreemly frustrating as it tells you what excel can do, gives brief formulas but then does not show you how to use them in detail so it can be difficult in trying to acheive the result with the given formulas."
3,More defined sections,I have enjoyed located and rating my Disney Pins. The only problem I had was locating pins. The book needs to have more specific subsections. This will help you locate the pin you are looking. Overall I enjoyed using this tool to determine what ranking my Disney pins were.
3,Disjointed but ok read,"I loved the premise of this book and I had enjoyed the first book in this series but, this one was tedious. I found that many of the flashbacks were annoying and I still don't understand why a few of them are in the story. While reading this book it felt like the author just pushed it out to get another book in the series done. It was jumpy and not many of the scenes were fully played out, making the reader go ""ok, so they are doing what now"".I found Dom to be a male ""pig"" that apparently changed almost overnight, which is a bit unrealistic. I found Mia really needed to grow up. And who gets married, whether for love or money who doesn't tell her best friend for days after she comes home, Come On!If you have a burning desire to read this book I suggest find it either on bookcrossing.com or a used bookstore!"
4,Good sequel,"BRIDE NEEDS GROOM starts out with Dom(inic) on a business trip in an airplane to Las Vegas where he meets Mia. Mia is in a wedding dress ready to get married to her mail order groom, which she has to do in order to keep her inheritance and luxury lifestyle.They get talking to each other and after Mia decides not to get married to Derrek (her mail order groom) she comes to find Dom, who agreed to marry her to help her out. It was planned as just another business deal but of course they can't deny their growing attracting for each other and end up staying together.Even though this book isn't as good as the first, it was still a nice refreshing fun read with lots of laughs and insides in the characters unusual meeting and way of thinking."
2,Disappointing,"The book shipped early from amazon.com and arrived September 17. It's only worth reading if you became a Chickalini family fan from prior books. The author is still having serious problems with the internal time line. In ""Once upon a Blind Date,"" Dominic Chickalini was 28. Now he is not quite 30, but Maggie and Charlie, who married at the end of the prior book, have children who are four and two, and another baby born in the course of this book. Meanwhile, Dom's sister Nina and her husband Joe who had baby Rose in ""The Nine Month Plan,"" now have Rose as a ten-year-old. At that time, Dom had just graduated from college, so if Rose is now ten, he ought to be 32.Aside from those and similar nuisances which are calculated to drive the reader nuts, the heroine is a cypher, Dom is obnoxious, and the ending is contrived.Maybe that should have been one star."
4,Wild Strawberries,"This is Bergman's first work where surreal sequences are imbedded in the picture. Though not intertwined with reality as in his later films but rather clearly separated from the flow as Borg's dreams, those scenes are terrific and must be very unusual at the time. Ingrid Thulin's calm beauty compliments her excellent performance greatly. There are a few minor but irritating details one cannot miss, particularly, the highway accident with the car hurling into a ditch as a football and its passengers getting out with a smile and without a scratch, and Sara and the boys. While Bibi Andersson looks just a bit older than the 17-year-old character she plays, the boys long forgot when they were that age, now both of mature complexion and well-shaven. Slightly over-hyped, it's a very good film nonetheless."
4,mild strawberries,To begin with I am usually hyper-critical of older movies. I don't like the over acting and bad close-ups for dramatic effect and bad music score. But this movie had none of that. Lots of sentimentality. Great acting. I liked all the characters. Beautiful shots. I rented this movie and now I will buy it on DVD. Not the best Bergman but a good movie overall.
3,Not Wild About Wild Strawberries,"I hate to disagree with all of those reviews out there! But, I must if I am to be honest with myself. I am a huge movie buff and so I will watch nearly anything. I heard this movie was very good and so I put it on my list of movies to see. I taped this off of Bravo and waited to watch it when I knew I was attentive enough for subtitles.I watched the whole movie with interest. I consider it a mediocre film at best. It was interesting to travel with this elderly man as he journeyed through his life again, reliving and contemplating key scenes. Also, I was intrigued by his aloof manner, especially with his daughter-in-law. She was staying with him because she was unhappy in her marriage to his son... mostly because the son was too much like his father in his obtuseness.In summary, 'Wild Strawberries' is interesting and thought provoking, but I was not wild about it... I hope you will enjoy it more."
3,Classy Swedish Number,"Criterion is known for releasing totally 80s and 70s films on DVD that are foreign in the United States. And again this fails to pass the American rating system at even a PG 13 level that it should be at because it's in a third world dialect of the Swedish language. These films Criterion releases to us on DVD here in the states, are racist to its own people. While this film Wild Strawberries is easy to follow without reading the subtitles and nothing bad happens on screen, it's in a third world dialect of Swedish. This is actually a pretty good Swedish film minus the dialect, and is not remotely close to Criterion's release of Salo 120 Days of Sodom, Italians eating their own feces. Instead here in Wild Strawberries we have Swedes refusing to admit they're good looking, and that's it. The Only reasoin someone would want to move to Sweden is not its econimic security, but good looking single Swedish women are easy to come by in the country on Sweden, not the states."
1,Masterpiece?,"Is it me, or is there anyone else out there that can't understand what qualifies this movie as a timeless masterpiece. The questioning of God is not deeply moving, but almost comical. The old man's rigidness is reminiscent of Ebineezer Scrooge, but you don't feel his pain as you do ... say...Henry Fonda(On Golden Pond). I guess you have to really study film to understand. However, if a movie is as great as this is supposed to be shouldn't it transcend all boundaries and be felt by all?"
5,the blood sweat and tears of perfection,"Everyone has heard a musical artist talk about how much work goes into making an album...but Imogen by far exceeds and is the definition of the word WORK. Buy this video, become inspired and appreciate the work of a TRUE atrist who has made a name for serself and is kind enough to share the journey so very few fans ever get to see of someone they look up to. If you've never heard Imogen's music, this is a perfict place to start and if you're a fan, a base to fall in love with her and the madness that is her musical creations all over again!This is no American record company pop garbage creation. So few artists are lucky enough to make music that is theirs and that they love. Imogen creates on her terms, her timeline and redefines perfection. She has compiled a loyal base of fans that continue to grow and is picking up more along the way. This is by far the best documentary you'll sink your teeth into this year. Enjoy-"
5,fascinating beyond words,"i looked into imogen heaps' music when i wanted to study production,i have been hooked ever since!she writes like no one else in this day and age, she has versatility, technical expertise, an eye for perfection and detail, and breathtaking sounds.this inspired me to work as hard as her for the career i want, and i will.she is a lovely person who deserves to be selling millions more records than britney spears or anyone else like that.i am forever in awe of her musical talent."
2,Good - yet dreadfully detailed...,"Say dear, if you are interested in Sgt. York's life, this book might be just what you are looking for, but if you are curious about the war, I don't recommend it. A very small portion of the book is given to discussing Sgt. York's involvement in battle, and the rest is a rather painfully detailed account of York raising money for schools. Though his cause was always worthy, at times the reading becomes mondane with financial and political jargon. The book seems to be worth reading, but perhaps with a little scanning being done. I believe the best part of Perry's writing, is simply seeing Sgt. York's character and reading his charming letters. Ho, ho. Only read this book if you are prepared to do a little perservering to find some gold."
2,Very inspiring but too detailed for the average reader.,"The quality of this book was undoubtedly superb, however, I would not recommend it to all audiences.. It is a very detailed account of Sgt. Alvin York's life before and after the war. The author did a wonderful job pulling together a vast amount of information into a readable 320 pages. But for someone who just wants a general account on the life of America's greatest World War 1 hero, it is much too in depth and almost boring. The book in itself was very well written, but like every book, the audience needs to be decided before reading it."
2,"Just read the first half, then skip to the end.","I would have given this book 2.5 stars if I could have, because only half of it is good. The first half is basically about Yorks life before, during, then after WW1. It's entertaining, I looked forward to reading it, and it is well written. The author uncovers a fascinating history, but after that the book goes down hill. Now the second half begins to go deeply, actually more than deeply - intensely, deeply, deep into his life after the war. The author puts in tons of information, some in which I can't imagine anyone would be interested in. The only way I could see this whole book being good would be if one had to do an in depth research papper on a specific factor of Sgt. York's life after the war. So skipping the second half would make this book great."

1,Boring!,"I'm going to do what the author couldn't seem to do ""get to the point"" This book was very dry and I hope that Sgt York had a moreexciting life (other than his war experience) than this book makes it sound. I had a hard time getting through it."
4,A DETAILED account of an amazing mans life!,"John Perry does an exceptional job writing this book on a very remarkable mans life. He writes of his war experience and of his devout, uncompromising faith in God. This book is however; a little to detailed in the last half. It can become quite tiresome in certain sections. Despite this I highly recommend it as a good book and as an accurate account of SGT. Alvin C. York's life. It is obvious that John Perry put forth an incredible amount of research to write this book and make it as accurate as possible."
5,Play this While you Soak in A Lavender Bath...,"An absolute must-have. An amazing woman--amazing music. If you must file it, file it under mod Latin music."
4,Delicious!,It's nice to find a coffee pod with some flavor! More mocha than cinnamon but really very good.
5,Great cup of coffee,"These pods work well with my Simplehuman coffee maker. And I can get both an 8 oz. cup and an additional 5 ozs out of each pod. Taste of the mocha cinnamon swirl is balanced and not too sweet. But do some comparison shopping - if you buy directly from the Java Podz website, the cost of both the pods and the s/h are lower than buying through Amazon!"
5,My intro. to poetry beyond Dr. Seuss,"I first heard of Anne Sexton when I was 14 and I had asked my aunt's boyfriend (a writer) to recommend a ""good"" poet. He hesitantly mentioned Anne Sexton and got a swift kick under the table from my aunt. I bought the book, and I loved it. I love the way she plays with language and explores the taboo and even the way she goes a little bit overboard. It's this fun communal voice, which is desperate and funny and beautiful and I love it. I would highly recommend this collection, which contains some of my favourite poetry."
5,Sexton a Gender Specific Voice,"Anne Sexton was an incredible poet her work is powerful, mesmerizing and thought provoking. Qualities that I definitely look for in great poetry and work that both genders can appreciate. But, part of what makes Sexton's poetry so powerful is the context under which it was written. She wrote deeply p personal poetry about women, about herself. About anger. About female anger. That is part of the reason her voice is so powerful she and Sylvia Plath were two women in the mid 20th century who were allowed to be angry, who reveled in their anger and claimed it. Her poems are not about abstract ideas, about Grecian Urns, but many of them about her personal experience as a woman, a wife a daughter. And people bought this. That was amazing, when you think about the roles of women at that time. Her collected work is interesting not only as great poetry but also as an amazing commentary about the status of women of her generation"
5,"Amazingly deep, personal, Anne","Of course, no words can justify this book, you really have to read it for yourself. Sometimes I find myself sitting around for hours just going through it--it seriously feels like dreaming. A lot of times they're nightmares, but they're always passionate. The feelings expressed can be found in all of us in some form, but if you can relate to Anne's struggle on a personal level, they'll speak even louder to you."
4,"Great Book, but would be better in hardback","I love Anne Sexton. She is one of my favorite poets. If you like Anne Sexton this book is great. It is so nice to have so many of her poems available in one place. If you are interested in this great poet's work this is a great and inexpensive way to start.The book itself is fairly sturdy, or at least as sturdy as a large paperback can get. I would, however, have preferred it in hardback, just so my copy would last through more readings."
5,Try it.,"If you grew up reading fairy tales and now realize that life is not always about happy endings, this collection may be for you. Anne Sexton's poems deal with love, loss and growth. In one poem, the speaker is a mistress writing to her lover, who has returned to his wife. The speaker describes herself, saying (something like), ""I am like watercolor/I wash off."" Sexton's poetry is full of such great imagery. Try it."
3,She is so depressing,"I love Anne Sexton, but really, one can only take her a little at a time. Having read her bio and her daughters book, ""To Mercy Street and Back"" I had to have her complete works. Here is a woman who is stark raving mad, incests her daughter, and is still a great writer, but even my dark side says ""too much"". I can't read too much at a time. Still, i'm glad to have it in my library. It is amazint too me how much medication her doctors kept her on, on had an affair with her, one sold her tapes, supposedly confidential information. I feel a great deal of empathy and pity for this woman, oh she also had a husband who liked to use her as a punching bag and a mother in law that took over her household she lived with a bunch of enablers, without which she might never have become a writer, but maybe would have had a chance at life. A true American tragedy of a woman abused in every way, but still a genius."
4,"nice shoes for running, less for walking","Got the shoes one week ago, I found that the shoes are very good for running, as it's pretty springy. But not very good for walking, with the narrow bottom. It is also pretty airy inside, perfect for my sweaty feet."
4,ehh - they're ok.,"Pros: Great cushioning / support! Simple design, and not too flashy. Very breathable, allowing plenty of air circulation around your foot.Cons: Not really comfortable. They seem to really wrap around your foot, which is fine if you go out for a run; but for walking / everyday life, you can't really let your feet 'rest'. I did have minor chafing (back of the foot) after the first run in them."
5,This Book Is Sooooooo Adorable!!!!,"This book is simply amazing, but I certainly wouldn't advise letting little kids get ahold of it, it could give nightmares!!HAHAHA!!!But it's perfet for the freaky, punk, goth, metal-head, or any dark soul in your life who needs an interesting coffee table book!:-D"
3,Too gory for toddlers!,"My son (2 years old) adored Kutner's book Zombie Nite Cafe. We checked it out from the library and he was starting to memorize verses so I ordered it from here. I also thought I would get this book without previewing it first.It's basically an alphabet book, but of Monsters, zombies, and everything ghoulish. The illustrations are really meant for older kids (10 and up) who wouldn't be spooked by some of the concepts. I thought since it was an alphabet book that it would be a little lighter with the illustrations, more like cartoons. One of the pictures shows a beheaded queen with her head dripping blood. I DO like the book, but it's put away on a high bookshelf for a couple of years."
1,Not for kids!,A friend's son brought this book home from an elementary school library. This disturbingly dark book has nightmare inducing pictures and phrases. I would not let my children read it nor would I recommend it to anyone.
2,Dry lecture,"I had the pleasure of reading reviews of this title before buying the product. Unfortunately the reviews I read did not clarify my mind about the product and I ordered it anyway, I was under the wrong impression that this dvd will create interest in various topics of physics among my students. However, to my utter dismay, the video is for those students who want to learn the subject without a teacher and to me it looks like a dry presentation of a very interesting subject. I would be useful only for those who wish to study the subject of physics at home without the help or guidance of a teacher.-drheracoaching"
3,no title,"This was a pretty good read, even if the writing was a tad simplistic. A little overblown. A lesbian murder mystery very much in the vein of Agatha Christie, with a huge cast of characters and lots of red herrings thrown in. I never did figure out the murderer with any surety. The description of the various lofts was quite intriguing, as was the well-described Minneapolis winter. Each of her characters was given a very delineated personality, but some of the conversations were stilted. This is the fifth in a string of Jane Lawless mysteries. Hadn't read a mystery in ages. Was a good choice for a vacation. I passed it on to my husband, who also read it. The title was used early on and did point to the murder. Again, very nicely drawn characters."
1,Faint praise for Faint Praise,"As a mystery, this was pretty good. But I couldn't get interested in the main character. During the course of the novel, her life is saved by two people, but she doesn't thank them or show any sort of gratitude towards them. Nor did she feel even the slightest bit guilty about her feelings or actions. I doubt if I'll read any more of Ms. Hart's books, even if they are set in my hometown of Minneapolis."
3,Not what you think... or is it?,"Another of the Bananamoon Obscura releases, the cd finds Daevid Allen doing a rehash of what sounds like a couple of older CDs, Gong In The Seventies and History & Mystery, with a lot of new agey synths throughout. Think of it as a dj set, but certainly NOT the Gong band."
4,Street Visions,Street Visions is a hot album. I could relate to his songs because I've been in those same positions. Me and my crew are always listening to that family ties because thats how we roll. I had to put my girl up on that True Feelings song to let her know how it is with other females. Trials of Life is the deepest song on the album.It is so graphic that you could picture just what he is saying. His flow and voice is also tight. I hope more people get exsposed to this blazing artist.
3,ZE1210 needs bios upgrade to keep from freezing up,"Our HP Pavilion kept freezing up. So did all the ones on the shelf at Best Buy. The technicians there were great. They found the BIOS upgrade info. When we searched HP's site there was nothing on freeze ups. They loaded it up, and when we get Microsoft to reregister Office we'll be hunky dorie. Kudos to Best Buy. Hands down to HP and Microsoft. If your HP ZE computer can't find a file on bootup you too have this issue."
3,Average,"So we where incouraged to buy this book for an advanced graduate level course in QM. I wouldn't recommend it though. I feel it is a hard book and that the explanations are often very unclear. All toghether however it does cover a lot of material which you may not find on analogous books. It was apparently chosen for this course because from a survey it came out as the best graduate level book to learn QM. I don't know, I'm glad I actually knew quite a bit of QM before starting to use this book otherwise it would have been a disaster."
5,"incredibly extensive, imaginative, and compelling","There simply is no other book like this on the market. In terms of Christian ethics, the editors require us to see that our worship, the manner in which we are liturgically formed, produces the kind of people we are. They begin with a few chapters explaining how Christian ethics came into being, and how they are determined by our worship practices. What follows are creative/provocative essays that span a wide range of issues including: gender, war, abortion, money, marriage, euthanasia, sex, arts, politics, and the environment. What renders this such an incredible book is how the authors explore what the eucharist, baptism, hymn-singing, footwashing, passing the peace, prayer, and other Christian practices have to do with the aforementioned issues. If you are interested in Christian ethics, and you want to read an accessible book from reputable sources, then you can do no better than this book."
4,Bass case,"Decent case for the money. A lot lighter than a typical ""hard"" case. Wouldn't want to throw it around as much, probably tend to tear it up if you did. Zipper works good but will have to see how long it holds up. I just use it for home storage so if you gig with this your milage may vary."
3,"Please, don't re-record songs without saying so.","Bought this album expecting it to have some of the songs from ""Starlight Dancer"". The song ""Want You To Be Mine"" is not the original version, and wasn't the original version on at least one other Kayak hits album I got. It's frustrating to buy CDs to replace vinyl but wind up with different, and therefore inferior to me, versions of the song. I expect studio cuts to be the same unless explicitly tagged ""re-recorded"" or similar. I like the band, and I like some of the songs on the album, but I want original versions."
3,Not New - A Collection of Already Available Titles,"How disappointing that there appear to be no new episodes on this video. From the short manufacturer's summary, it appears that the titles on this disc were previously made available on other discs. It's got ""Sinbad Sails Alone,"" ""Pirate Camp,"" and ""Tale of the Mighty Knights"" (mis-characterized in the summary as including a ""not-so-nice dragon,"" but rest assured, the dragon is nice). I guess this would be a fun gift for a toddler who likes pirates and doesn't already have the original discs, but too bad it's not a collection of new stories for the legions of ardent Backyardigans fans (both child and adult) out there."
1,"LOVE backyardigans, HATE this rip-off","Clearly, there is only 1 new episode on this dvd. All the others have been previously released. The proof is here:[...]How ridiculous! How insulting to those of us who have purchased all the previous dvd'd."
1,A Great Disappointment,"Schlage has cheapened their knobs in every way conceivable. The metal is thinner, the knobs smaller, the metalwork is shoddy, the lock feels chintzy when you turn it, and on and on. I went out of my way to buy Schlage, thinking it was better than your average lower-priced knob. Boy, was I wrong. I installed three of them to replace knobs with tarnished finishes and had them all off and ready to return by the next night. Save your time and money and get something better. These scream junk!"
5,Beautiful chimes in both appearance and tone,Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. The sizes of the wood pieces and bells are much larger than expected. Very nicely made and provides delightful gentle tones. Very pleased with this item and highly recommend them.
4,Big step above Total Terror!,Bill leep quit with skinny puppy to start his own band cause he wanted to be a lead singer thats wierd cause there are only 3 songs with vocals but it's not a big problem the keyboard are good without vocals the only song i enjoy with vocals in it would have to be Black march.Think of this album haveing all the good songs from Total Terror part 1 & 2 and not the boreing ones... that is the simple way of saying how good Initial Command realy is!
3,Not my favourite FLA album,I don't know why however this CD just didn't appeal to me at all. There was no song that stood out to be counted. This was FLA when it first started out and the listener will be able to feel the 'primitiveness' and 'beginner's touch' in each song on this audio CD. The songs are too repetetive for long songs and sound too drawn-out. There is no spark that ignites the listener's imagination like so many other FLA songs do. If I had to pick a standout song on this album I would reluctantly say Track 8: No Control for even though it is very repetetive it does show that little spark of imagination. Other than that it is a missable album.3 stars are because of my respect for Peterson and Leeb and Fulber with all that they have accomplished in FLA and Delerium and the other side projects.
2,Contains sucralose,"I was disappointed to discover this product is sweetened with sucralose (generic name for Splenda). It also contains artificial flavors. I prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners, and was surprised to find it in a ""health product""."
5,Charming for catlovers/tea enthusiasts; value of companions,"I came across Mr. Putter and Tabby Pour the Tea recently when visiting the wonderful Rosetree Cottage tearoom and gift shop in Pasadena, California. I purchased it as a treat for myself and wish I now had copies for my friends. It's a small book, simple to read with nice illustrations. It's a collector's item for catlovers and tea enthusiasts alike. It tells the story of elderly Mr. Putter living alone and wishing he had a cat as a companion. He searches for and finds an older cat with similar qualities as himself. He chooses and takes home this tabby and they become close friends and companions enjoying each other's company including having tea together"
5,Great Book and a Great Series,Mr. Putter and Tabby show young readers that not all things need to be new to be worthwhile. Mr. Putter adopts an old cat and the two become comfortable companions. Experience is valued in this book--an excellent lesson for children.
3,"If You're a Beginner, It May Help...","but if you know what you're doing, there is not much that you haven't figured out. As a long time mac user and someone who has read considerably in the mags and online, there was very little of interest. But if I was clueless, this book might be handy. Pretty pictures, tho."
1,Don't bother with this one.,"I purchased this book a while ago, and was disappointed with it ever since. Regardless of what Amazon's Editorial says; it is a NEWBIE book. All of the tips and tricks in this book are common knowledge among the Mac community. I'd say out of the entire book only 5 of the tips are useful. The book uses its design and layout to padd out the size so that it looks worth it. Its not.If you want more knowledge help books look else where. If you need help with Jaguar or Panther check out sites like <http://www.macosxhints.com> or the others.I'm sorry but this book left me disappointed and wanting my money back."
4,Fun bathroom reading,"This book is great for the few spare moments you might have during the day. You can pick up non-obvious tips to enhance your experience of using OS X; or, at least, I did."
4,May look too simple but it is beyond that,"When reading this book, it is easy to think that the author will more often than not use simple things as tips, that the book could also be a lot smaller. But there is nothing more wrong than that. Those who persist will find gold hidden among the very ilustrative and pleasant pages. The humor is unfortunately annoying instead of light and supportative. But don't get distracted by that. There is a of value in it. Highly recommended."
5,Interesting Tidbits,"Not the manual, but just what the titles states, all cool tips and enough attitude to keep you amused as can be expected from Scott."
2,Not worth it,"I was very disapointed with this book. I bought Mac OS X The Missing Manual along with this book, but the Missing Manual is by far the superior book (for about the same price).This book uses full color pages, large type, and large screen captures to waste space. It could easily have been condensed into half the number of pages, or better yet, just put online in the form of a web page where something like this belongs.The tips are mostly very trivial and obvious ones - I'm not sure I came across a single one I wasn't already familliar with. I *suppose*, if you don't know any of the little keyboard tricks for navigating your mac quickly, this may be useful to you, but I think I'll be selling mine - I consider it a waste of money."
1,Disapointment,"I bought the ""Killer Tips"" in the hope that it would help me acquaint myself with differences between Mac OS X and the previous Mac operating systems with which I consider myself reasonably familiar since I am a Mac user of moderate competence. The book did not fulfill this expectation largely because the lack of a reasonable index which has only about 500 entries, far to few to find answers quickly to the questions that arise inevitably in the process of one's switch from previous to the latest operating system, a Jaguar of spots distinctly different than its ancestors."
3,Great for complete beginners,"If you've used OS X for a little while you'll know most or all of these. (Unless you're pretty slow to pick things up on computers.) If the book were marketed that way, I'd give it 5 stars, since it looks great for complete beginners, pointing out little things like ""Command-A selects all the files in the folder you have open"" I'm not kidding! the things are that obvious. Anyone who takes the time to look at the keystroke short cuts listed in the menus and play around and hit all the buttons and right-click everywhere will already know 95% of this. I did learn two things: you can add aliases to your button bars in the Finder, and leaving an app open in OS X barely uses any resources. Nice but not worth the price of the book.Get Rael Dornfest's OS X Hacks instead if you want to learn something new."
2,Don't state the obvious,"Scott Kelby has written a book that is beautifully typeset and in fact does contain a useful tip or two, but the majority of the content feels to me as ""stating the obvious"".It might be a good guide for those among us who do not adventurously explore their new environment once they made the leap from MacOS 9 (or even Windows) to MacOS X, but I really doubt if this book gets used as a reference manual after the first read.In my opinion ""Killer Tips"" is not a good title for this book; it's more like another ""MacOS X, the Missing Manual"" type of book."
4,I am somewhat disappointed,"Dont get me wrong this album is pretty good for what it was. I am a Pethead so I cant give Petra anything less than 3 or 4 stars. The thing(s) I dont like about this album is its shortness(the concert was longer). 3 songs were cut from this recording for times sake(I dont buy that). The reason I dont is because Captured In Time and Spaces is considerably longer. it is apprx 73 minutes. There wasn't much talking on this one either.Enough of my ranting. The nagative things I described have nothing to do with musicianship or even the quality of the recording, both are somthing special. The choice of the song list is preety good. They are all the classics. The rock medly is my favorite.To sum it all up. This is not my favorite Petra album(I own em all) BUT it is definently a great one reguardless of my disappointment I just wish it was longer."
5,Petra Leaves a Masterpiece,"After 33 years, Petra says Farewell with what could be their best CD ever. Every song is filled with emotion as the band shows their appreciation for their fans.I wasn't at the taping of the CD, but I was at a show a few weeks later and you can just tell that this CD and the tour are a labor of love to the fans that have stuck with Petra through good times and bad. John Schlitt's vocals are near flawless and Bob Hartman, as always, just rocks. Hearing Greg X. Volz sing again was a real treat and to hear the keyboards of one of my favorite bandmembers of all time, John Lowry was pure bliss.When I play this CD in the car, I turn it up all the way and just sing at the top of my lungs because it rocks from beginning to end with a few minutes of rest during the ballad section.Petra fans will sense the energy in this CD and if you have never heard Petra, this CD gives you a sense of their history."
5,Another obscuro so I'm keeping it brief,"What an intoxicating collection of cutting edge music. One splendid tune after another, played with verve and grace, sterling solos and glorious rhythm. These recordings are nearly 80 years old, made in primitive studios with rudimentary equipment, yet the beauty is dazzling. There are way too many Ellington releases out there, with overlap and duplication and lesser or better transfers. But this one works for me. Hear Duke the composer. Enjoy Duke the bandleader. Savor Duke the pianist. These guys can play!This CD has provided many hours of pleasure. What else do you need to know?"
4,Intense story of an airline hijacking written for the teen market,"This is an intense story written for the teen market. Linda Logan is on a flight from Dallas to Jamaica and she notices a man behaving oddly. Even though he passes all security checks, he still frightens her. It turns out that her instincts were correct. He is one of a team of hijackers with bombs strapped to their bodies. They force the crew to simulate a crash by diving towards the sea while issuing a mayday hail. The pilot is instructed to pull out of the dive at the last second and then fly on to Belize, where the hijackers have removed the jungle growth from an old airfield.The ransom demands are issued, but Linda manages to escape and find help from an unlikely academic source. When the soldiers arrive, she bravely volunteers to go back to help free the remaining hostages. The story is tense, the action is exciting and you are relieved when the hostages are freed. I enjoyed the story and recommend it to teen audiences."
2,Machine,"The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are amazing, but aside from an unexpected ""Pin (Remix)"", these songs are among the band's worst."
3,Too Good To Be True,"We love the bandThe DVD was fun as a view of the Moody Blues.It was not a concert performance - it was karaoke (a lip-synch concert).We were hoping for more, but the package did not promise it.Too bad."
4,THE MOODIES WERE THE GREATEST.,"AFTER WATCHING THE DVD FOR A FEW SONGS I WONDERED, OH NO, IS THIS REALLY LIVE? I JUMPED TO AMAZON TO READ THE REVIEWS (HEY, THOSE REVIEWS ARE REALLY HELPFUL), AND SURE ENOUGH, SADLY, NO, IT'S NOT. I SHOULD MENTION SOME OF THE SONGS DO SOUND LIKE LIVE VERSIONS. AT ONE POINT, RAY AND JOHN START TO SING A LITTLE EARLY, AND IT COMES OFF AS A HONEST CONCERT MISTAKE. NEVERTHELESS, IT'S A GREAT LOOK BACK AT A AMAZING BAND AND IS AS STATED, A MUST FOR FANS OF THE MOODIES. BY THE WAY MIKE PINDER, THE BANDS NOT BEEN THE SAME SINCE YOU LEFT, SO PLEASE IF ABLE DO A STUDIO ALBUM WITH THEM, ONE MORE TIME. GOD BLESS."
5,The Lost Performance,"I received my DVD from Mike Pinder's website. Early and signed by him. It is a great DVD. I was not able to see them during the 60s and 70s. So it is nice to see what they looked and sounded like. You can't put today's standards onto something that was done in the 70s. So if you are looking for a concert as it would be recorded today, than you would be disappointed. I on the otherhand thoroughly enjoy watching it. Even with all of its flaws. So if you are a true fan, You will want to own this DVD."
1,"No wonder it's a ""lost performance""",I highly doubt the group or anyone in their camp gave the approval to release this thing. Most likely a case of 50 different possible scenarios that plague veteran rock bands on a daily basis.
1,IT'S NOT LIVE. THEY ARE MIMING TO RECORDINGS.,"This is basically The Moody Blues miming to pre-recorded music. It's ""Live"" only on the sole fact that there is an ""audience"". And on top of all that Mike Pinder is ""playing"" a Hammond C3 organ and not his trusty Mellotron, that was what gave the Moody Blues they're unique sound. I purchased this a while ago and returned it to the retailer with the statement that they need to put some kind of disclaimer that this is not actually a truly ""Live"" performance. If you're a big MB fan than I guess you need this, as there are not a lot of ""Live"" performances with Mike Pinder in the group but what a let down. Wait for the Classic Artists documentary The Moody Blues this spring that should have some decent live performances.So in summation: it's not a live performance, it should have remained lost"
1,toucansam,"I watched this DVD tonight, and have to say that it was great! I loved seeing the original Moodies smoking, drinking, and just getting into their music. I also really enjoyed hearing some music that didn't make it into their later performances; like ""Tortoise and the Hare"", ""Don't You Feel Small"". ""Never Comes the Day"", and ""Lazy Day"". These, among many of their songs, were not part of their later concerts.Although the sound was not up to current standards, it is still a great concert!"
5,STOP ALL THE WHINING! GREAT VINTAGE MOODY BLUES!,"Okay, I see this DVD has been getting some bad reviews, so I figured I'd chime in a bit. Regardless of whether it's lip-synched or not it's still classic Moody Blues and something most have never seen before. The picture and sound of this DVD are great. The song selection is also stellar. Come on, you can never get tired of listening to Nights In White Satin. And let's not forget the very subtle but attractive packaging. I love the color choices. The silver they used on this packaging, it just pops, very nice! And the background almost looks like rain. It really fits the image of the band. Definitely an A+ title, go and buy it."
1,Nice photographic pressed flower and that is all,"I hastily bought this on pre-order thinking Alive Plus 5 Moody Blues quality on video, well what a let down. If you like looking at the Moody Blues, this is a fine and fairly clear picture of them. For that it is fun, as for the performances, ugghh. I adore the Moody Blues and this is pale and lifeless. With a few exceptions these are just the Moodies mouthing over the studio versions of the songs and it is painful. If you sit there wondering if it's live, it is not a good sign. It is a nice memento of them in pictures and that is all. If that is enough for you, then buy it, if like it does for me, the music comes first, then save your money."
3,Bootleg?,"I love the Moody Blues, especially the older songs on this video.Sadly, though, the quality of this video is poor, especially the sound.Still, worth the price for a die-hard MB fan.."
2,An Interesting Piece Of History,"This is a raw piece of work. The cameras are in all the wrong places and the over-dubs are apparent everywhere. But, this is the only footage from that era that I have seen. It isn't a great show, but it is a piece of history."
4,Best Little Green Machine,"I've used other portable steamers in the past, and the Bissell Little Green Proheat is definately the best one I've purchased. I only wished I would have got one of these a couple of years ago. With three dogs and three cats this steamer gets used a lot."
5,Excellent around the house machine,This is an excellent machine to have around the house for cleaning up after pets or anything else. It is nice and small and works very well for such a cheap unit. Also great for cleaning couches and the interrior of cars.
1,Breaks,"I have owned two of this product. The first one that I had, I hadn't used it very often when the head snapped off where the blue part connects. I thought that it was my own fault for pushing too hard (trying to suck all of the liquid out of the carpet). I bought another one, since that part was not a replaceable part. Now with my second one, again, not using it very often, but also past the one year warranty, the hose just broke and is also not a replaceable part. This item costs over $100 and it seems that they use poor quality of plastics or a poor design and have NOT made a durable product. I am highly disappointed in this product and will not be purchasing yet ANOTHER REPLACEMENT. I will look for a different brand until they can provide all of the necessary replacement parts for their poorly designed device."
1,SUCKY Vacuum!,"This vacuum is a waste of money! More time spent cleaning it after use than it saves you in cleaning spots. Best to use a sponge,detergent/water solution and an old towel. DONT BUY!!"
3,Good for small jobs.,I bought this because I have an older dog who sometimes has accidents. It works pretty well on small areas and is simple to set up. Cleaning is a bit of a pain but a necessity. The clear containers make it easy to see how much solution is left and how much dirt comes up. The cleaning solution is a bit pricy but I haven't experimented with a concoction of my own and use the recommended Bissell cleaning solution.
3,Good for spills - but have to unclog sprayer often,"Have had this model for over 5 years. This works great for extracting spills. However, if you do not religiously run clean water through after you use it, the Bissell cleaning solution will solidify in the heater. We dismantled the whole unit after it quit spraying and found the heating element completely clogged with ""soap"". We have only used the solution specifically for this unit.Bottom line: works great. Do not store solution in tank. After use, run clear water through system to clean and sprayer should stay patent!"
2,Not worth the money!,"I bought this hoping to use it for spot cleaning and areas stained from high traffic. I wasn't impressed with the brush use or with the suction capabilities. The biggest problem came only after a few uses, when the suction failed altogether. The problem (after my husband took everything apart) was the heater element itself. All the water has to go through it and it had gotten clogged with calcium deposits from the water (or cleaner fluid - that came with the product). It worked briefly after getting cleaned out, but that was a royal pain to do! It clogged up again after 1 or 2 uses and finally, after taking the heating element out altogether - it works ok. It mainly just takes up room in my hall closet, because I never use it!"
1,Sprayer Problem,"I had an older Little Green, used heavily and loved it, so I bought this model and have the same problem. It's a few years old and used only a couple times. The sprayer no longer works."
1,Clogged Up!!,"When I first bought the Little Green ProHeat, I loved it. I have an older, often incontinent dog and thought the Little Green ProHeat was the best thing since sliced bread -- small, easy to carry, easy to use, easy to clean, great suction. Then after about 3 months, it stopped spraying. At first I thought it was just the nozzle so I cleanned it out, but still no spray. I see another reviewer found a problem with the heating element clogging so I will open it up and try to remove the heating element. If I bought a new one I would get the one without the heating element. I have the big Bissel upright carpet steamer without the heating element and love it."
1,Spray broke after 6 uses,"The first time I used this machine I thought it was ok. It did spread the dirt and so instead of cleaning up just the spot, I ended up doing the whole area.. Small, easy to carry. Be careful when you put it back together after cleaning--if it doesn't work, you might have the gasket on backwards. On the fifth or sixth time, the spray nozzle quit working. Haven't been able to repair it.I wouldn't buy it again. . .for the money I'd spend more and buy a full size machine or rent one. For spot cleaning, I use one of the spray and pat dry cleaners (Nature's Miracle since I'm usuallly am dealing with pet stains)."
3,Solution capacity,"The little machine is real nice to work with, light, compact, easy to use, and it really does a nice cleaning job.The only item that could improve is the capacity for your cleaner and the capacity for the return water. Really too small.Somehow the manufacture should double it in size now that would be a nice unit. I also found the tanks somewhat awkward to handle because of their shape.If I did have problems with this one I must say I WOULD WITHOUT ANY DOUBT BUY ANOTHER ONE, it does the job and does the job well."
1,"More flavour, please","As my princess loves raspberries, I figured this would be an ideal gift.Alas, her over-enthusiastic use of this product did not produce the expected result - the cheesecake didn't taste of raspberries.Worse, we both felt a little hot and bothered afterwards and needed a long, cold shower to recover."
2,Useful but not objective,"This is a book on Kashmir by a friend of Benazir Bhutto, thediscredited and corrupt former prime minister of Pakistan. Althoughthe book is an improvement on many others on the subject by its consideration of the ethnic and linguistic complexities of the region, it suffers from its over-reliance on the leftist viewpoint... But in spite of its obvious failings the book will be useful to many readers who wish to get started on the subject.We are waiting to see if her new book on Kashmir will be more insightful."
2,Mediocre and Overpriced,"Romance Silver is a very generic scent, you've smelled this before. To me it smells much like most other scented men's products like shaving cream, deodorant, etc. A very linear light, fresh, crisp, scent. That being said, it's not bad. They did a good job creating and fine tuning a basic fragrance, just at a price of around $1 per mL you would expect a more complex cologne. Smelling this fragrance brings back memories of high school for me. Not a bad thing, but just not what I'm looking for, definitely a fragrance for the young crowd.If you're looking for a basic, crisp, clean, fresh scent and can afford it, then this product may be good for you. If you're looking for a refined, mature, complex fragrance keep looking. I'm not a fan of this cologne."
4,A Star Wars Disc for everyone!,Meco will forever be associated with Star Wars for his 1977 Star Wars Medley. I remember what an incredible affect that song had on me. The combination of music and dialogue from Star Wars only reminded me further of the excitement the film had brought me. I will always remember that song. He furthers that legacy with his current release. Meco's interpretations of the original music mixed in with his own composition leaves you feeling extremely energized. The combination of the symbolism and emotion of the film score remixed so masterfully leaves you in a state of euphoria. Everyone will enjoy this cd. It is especially great for those Saturday night parties!
4,All Albums By Meco,"Meco is an incredibly talented and fascinating artist...I love the genius of Meco's music.Of all the Meco Albums, Meco's latest album is his best...Trivia: Did you know Meco produced Kenny G's First Album? It's true! Meco please keep on going in the music biz...Great Web Site and a very nice collection of music."
2,"Sorry, not a Meco Fan","Perhaps it was my fault for not reading the reviews or description more closely, but this CD is not at all wat I expected or wanted. While the CD is fine if you want a 70's Techno-Dance version of the various themes, I would have prefered a version closer to the original. Also, in another reviewer's commentary he or she mentioned voice clips from the movie. Well those are not the originals, and I found them quite annoying especially when Meco did a very poor Yoda impersonation. This CD reminds me of one of those 60's or 70's classics CD's where the songs are poor renditions by ""various artists"" as opposed to the original groups."
2,Uneven and incomplete collection,"I've been a fan of MECO's music since the time of Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk. This latest CD was a disappointment. The fidelity of the album is poor, surprising when considering the tracks were digitally rerecorded and remastered. Case in point: The Empire Strikes Back tracks. The album title is a misnomer: Not all songs are complete as is the case with The Force Theme, Finale, and Ewok Celebration. And at a total CD time of 41:33, it wasn't due to lack of disk space. As for the new tracks, Duel of the Fates/Augie's Municipal Band stands out as the more interesting. But all in all, I found this a half-baked album. Meco should consider rereleasing some of his earlier LPs on CD, such as Encounters of Every Kind and Music from Star Trek and The Black Hole. As dated as disco may be, MECO was responsible for some excellent music."
3,Well !,"Biggest Meco fan here, and to me the biggest, hardest, issue here is the quailty of the product from 2 different points 1st) Its overall sound: This should be Great but its more like Average or just below and 2nd) (most importantly) If you asked me, I would say Meco have very little or nothing to do with the Main construction AND/OR editing of this Album. I LOVE THIS GUYS STYLE, but its clearly missing from this album. Like he signed off on the release but didnt go in and re-produce it, all just done in the recording studio from older info. But It is MECO so gotta have it. With all the newer Movies released since those time (Batman, Superman 5, Spiderman, the X-men, Watchmen, I wish he would do a New album with some of these flicks..."
2,Needs Work,"The graphics are really poor and the whole book reads like an ASME Y14 manual. The only text that is descriptive is mind numbing repetition of what the particular lesson is about. I bought the book so I could use SW more effectively and try to get away from going back and forth to ACAD all the time. It might help, but the pain really isn't necessary. A cut below what should be expected from a $50.00 book."
3,I've read better but this isn't bad,The forms in the book are probably the best part of it...they give you patterns to follow for planning out goals and evaluating your performance.
1,kjg,i would recommend this to others to buy the tape on the back held pretty well. i only put a 1 star since it didnt fit my picks
5,Very Nice,"Great finish, easy to install and very smooth, solid operation. We have had these on three other doors now for about a year and they look and operate as the day they were new."
3,SCHLAGE PASSAGE KNOB,"SEEMS TO BE WELL MADE, BUT HAD I SEEN THIS IN PERSON I NEVER WOULD HAVE PAID THIS MUCH FOR IT. VERY UN-SPECTACULARWHEN IT ARRIVED."
2,"Should be called ""Atlas of Jewish Diaspora and a Few Others""","I read this book last year and wound up returning it due to what I thought was missing content (and a misleading title that caused me to buy it in the first place). Although this book gave an in depth look at the Jewish diaspora (covering nearly half the book) and a good discussion on the definition and introduction on diasporas, it gave less coverage to many of the other diasporas. The Armenian and African diasporas were worth a look, but other nationalities were glossed over (i.e. Greek, Kurdish, etc...)."
5,Metheny delves into Acid Jazz!,"This CD has to be the most satisfying of all his releases. Not only does he satisfy the Metheny fan, he makes new fans out of those who enjoy hip grooves. Take your pick on this CD. Title track, To the End of the World, Red Sky, The Girls Next Door; Metheny and his band gives the right touch to this release. One of my favorite CD's!"
5,What!!!!,"All I have to say is that I'm on my 3rd or 4th CD because each one I've gotten I've worn out! This CD is classic and gets me through the day, it stays loaded in my disc changer in the car."
3,"Worth a shot, but don't depend on it","I bought this to cover up a shoulder tattoo that was visible when I wore my strapless wedding dress.I have to say that this wasn't the solution for me, but that doesn't mean it won't be for others.I actually ended up going with a random assortment of concealers and loose powder. The cover that I got from this product, looked as though I had covered something up. I wanted my covering to not be noticable. I could also feel it while it was on. The makeup route was more comfortable.I want to be clear that this product does work. It covers the tattoo. But, the application is a long and arduous process that is better left to someone with professional makeup application experience, and if you're going to that extent, you may as well not even buy this. They can cover a tattoo up without it."
4,Heady travel fare...,"Picked up a copy in a gift shop at Chicago O'Hare airport. Laffed my way Albany, via Pittsburgh. Throughly enjoyed the ridiculous and oft times ""confusticating"" cyber-punk. At first it struck me as the private musings of a terminally bored and out of work english major but indeed impressed me for what it was in the end. A cynical, silly, ridiculous and at times much more serious than you might think collection of short stories. The 4th star was for the cover art. Huzzah."
3,This is not literature,"But it is funny as hell. Kind of like watching South Park. Is it important? Is it going to change your life? Well, no. But it may, like David Byrne writes on the back cover, make you laugh out loud in the bathroom. Great entertainment, but if you want literature pick up a book by Vollman or Faulkner."
5,a howl through America's icon from inside a maniac's brain,"The most original voice in America today. Certainly a proponent of the old saying, ""if you remember the seventies, you didn't do it right&quot"
2,"Funny, but that not that funny","Is Mark Leyner funny? Yup, and clever too, and ""My Cousin, My Gasteroenterologist"" is full of good jokes. The problem, then, is that they're buried under so much junk and pseudo-transgressive ""genre-busting"" that you'd never know they were there unless you look really closely, and having to put that much effort into finding humor kind of negates its value as humor. Which is a shame, because Leyner's obviously smart and has something to say about something (His short piece - not in this collection - about the Death of Postmodernism is fall-out-of-your-chair funny). Kinda just wish he'd settle down and stop congratulating himself and write a real book, one of these days. This one's an amusing diversion, and he's obviously talented, but it's not much else. It'd be sad if Leyner wasn't satisfied with just a smirk."
2,"And before Robbins, Richard Farina (w/paragoric Pell Mells)",Mark simply isn't taking this stuff seriously. This book makes a mockery of the great American economic system and all of its munificence. This great land of ours deserves better than the heir to Tom Robbins' Tomfoolery...
1,What was the point of this?,Sure it was witty and off the wall but annoying as hell to read. Well written but no point.
1,DON'T EVEN BOTHER; HE IS THE WORST AUTHOR EVER!,"Unfortunately I read Tetherballs of Bougainville all the way to the bitter end, so when I picked up this one I dropped in the trash without ever even opening it. I ordered them over the net for a very good price and now feel like I was robbed. This guy is the worst author ever."
3,This must be for Experienced JSP programmers,"I bought it because it was cheap and I could not afford JSP Complete Reference at that time. Anyway, if you know Java maybe it is best to get an introductory JSP book prior to starting this book.It gets very confuse, because it throws many information at once and does not explain it in detail. Instead, it is left as known by the reader. The book calls it self Complete Guide, and yet it covers every important aspect of JSP, it fails to teach beginners.I had to bought a new book and also get a few on line tutorials so it is as complete as it calls it self.I wonder that I consider it because even though I am intermediate Java programmer, I am completely new to TOMCAT and JSP. Maybe I will change my mind after learning JSP and then being able to understand this book as it should.LATER EDIT ( 2010 ): Please use ASP.NET and C# instead of any form of Java web programming.Java is very cool I admit, but not for web."
2,JSP and JAVA,"look at 1st a few chaps, could find myself getting more confused. Symply saying the usage of params as well as sort of ""why"". I could not say ""I did my Apache-Tomcat config well fit into each other"", even if I read and read... If this were valuable to people who's new to Apache tomcat, it should have had sort of explanation to default configs made by initial Apache/Tomcat installation. To make this book yours truly, reader'd better have sort of experience in Apache/tomcat. Every thing I wanted to know was explained or touched, but I can not figure out how to do. To do is to believe. not that to read to believe. I don't want to kill my time any more reading this, at least at this moment. If you don't have even basic-basic-basic.. commands or concept, think about buying this after you read steb-by-step book first. This is NOT the STEP-BY-STEP book."
2,Not much to this one...,"Yeah, there's this coven of witches, and a couple of cute girls are being lured into it, but that doesn't prevent this film from being only so-so at best. One of the girls becomes the plaything of the head female witch, but any potential eroticism is wasted as they never actually do anything together. Aside from a couple of brief moments when the girls are without their clothes, this film was just plain boring."
2,this is for children,this dvd is a waste for adult.its just a peek tour of 10 food factories. i wanted more detail of how machine do their things.i can't remember seeing anything like what's on the dvd case.its a total let down for me.
5,"El Sabroso [""The Tasteful One""]","Very authentic tasting nacho tortilla chips...don't even hesitate to buy these...they put all others to shame! A scrumptious creation: light and crunchy texture, sufficiently cheesy, pleasantly hot, and set off with just a whisper of lime. If you're into health, they're weighing in at only 1.5 grams of saturated fat, zero trans fat, and two grams of fiber. So order up, crack a cold-one, and prepare for some nearly guilt-free, munching pleasure!"

3,A snapshot in time,This book was written in the middle of the Second World War by one of FDR's top Lieutenants of the New Deal and W.W.II. The job of organizing and prioritizing petroleum production and delivery fell to Harold Ickes. It was a huge challenge and involved delivery of fuel and other products to every corner of the globe. Ickes created delivery systems and pipelines that were vital in the war effort. His discussion of oil shale and oil sands aspossible replacements for conventional petroleum sources is much the same as those being put forward 65 years later. The appendix has a glossary of terms that shows how little has changed in more than half a century in the oil patch. This book is not a page-turner by any means. it is more like a diary.
4,Swimming Pool Sunday book,"My wife would like to read everything written by Madeleine Wickham, aka Sophie Kinsella, and this was the last book we found that she had not read. It is different from the others as it does not have the humor factor, but is more serious. However, it still is a good read."
2,Swimming Pool Sunday,An indifferent read. Good for taking away on holiday when you could read it and not concentrate too much on it. Sadly true to modern life and the damage lawyers can do to situations that are definitely an accident.
2,Condition,"I was pretty disappointed with the condition of the book when I received it. It was very yellowed and had previously been in a library as noted by the stamps. I don't think the description of this book 'Good' or 'Like New' was accurate, I would have gone with another seller if I knew what I was receiving.I love Sophie Kinsella, but unfortunately don't think this was her best work. Good, quick read, just not the best."
2,super sweet,"I sought out this syrup due to the fact that it's one of the few that does not use high fructose corn syrup. I guess that's why I seemed so shocked that it was SOOO sugary sweet. Additionally, the individual flavor of pistachio is hard to discern, unlike other pistachio flavorings I've had."
3,Jimmy Gentry,"It was not what I expected. I thought it would be a movie, not documentary. It was interesting information. He is a true American hero."
4,Wonderful book although it doesn't address American Slang,"I originally purchesed this book to help with a historical writing project I was involved in. It proved to be somewhat useful in that endeavor, limited only because it didn't address American military slang during WW II. It's also just plain fun to read, offering, along with definitions, almost anthropological insight into (mainly) the WW II era British Army and Navy. A wonderful reference for anyone trying to get down the military slang from the 40's."
4,Basic doorknob,"Bought 5 of these and they're easy to install basic doorknobs. The only problem is 1 package had clearly been opened before and resealed. That set was missing some of the screws necessary. I had extra from another project so not a big problem for me, but I would have been really irritated."
4,"Easy to install, work well","We purchased these to replace existing, cheap plastic door knobs. Installing these was pretty much foolproof, only requiring a screwdriver. A significant improvement!If you're looking for an inexpensive, nice looking door knob set, without getting the full architectural look (with matching prices), these would likely meet your requirements."
1,Huge disappointment,"I bought this machine to replace a $15 Hamilton Beach blender that was ready for the Salvation Army. Now I'm going to give this piece of junk away instead. First, it isn't ""18-speed"" - it's just a continuous adjustment from slow to faster. They could just as well call it 6 or 12 or 24 or 32 speed. Second, it can't even completely blend a ripe banana into a milk shake without leaving 2 or 3 little balls of banana in the bottom. And third, it's EXTREMELY noisy - screams and vibrates like it's trying to destroy itself. I bought a Cuisinart food processor about 20 years ago, and it is still an excellent machine that I use frequently. It's hard to believe this ... blender bears the same name."
1,DON'T Buy this one!,I have just about every Cuisinart product they make and LOVE everything. This is junk. I have only used it a couple times and it stopped working. It's really too bad they have a nice line of products except this. Yikes.. Steer clear or this.
4,Excellent for Florida Boys Quartet Fans,"If you are or have been a Florida Boys Quartet fan, then this is an above average musical journey through their early years. While not my favorite group, they had a long history of high quality recordings and were part of (and host) of the Singing Jubilee along with the Happy Goodmans and the Inspirations. This would be a fine library addition for the dedicated southern gospel quartet fan. Bill Gaither also had a VHS 3-volume compilation set of the Singing Jubilee and various southern gospel group performances that is outstanding."
1,Huge disappointment -- OLD reruns with only one new episode,"My daughters (3&1.5Y)love the Little Einsteins. However, we were didappointed to find out that the DVD just compiles several episodes of the Little Einsteins. In addition, the episodes (except the elephant one was the newest on our DVR) seem to be older ones. My daughters love the format of having a mission, patting for ""super fast"", and the ""curtain call"". The older episodes do not have ""super fast"" and ""curtain call"", which made my daughters less interested in the ""mission"". Overall, it's a good DVD, but had I known that it's just several old episodes, I wouldn't spend money on buying it."
4,Very nice,"I like the helmet a lot. It fits perfectly and looks pretty good. I did not have a problem taking the stickers off. I only gave it 4 stars, because a little more padding would have been nice."
5,Great product!,"Looks fantastic. The leather and detailing is just great. Looks a lot better on than most half helmets that are up to DOT standards, not as chunky as our other half helmet. Good price too - would recommend this product to everyone!"
4,Good looking but with some shortcomings,Bought this helmet to replace a similar Bell Shorty Leather where the zipper on the removable ear-flaps gave up.Helmet looks pretty good and is not too bulky.However I didn't like the stupid stickers that teared up the low quality leather imitation when you try to peel them off. I also agree with another reviewer that the strap is to vertical and pulls unnecessarily hard on the wind pipe.For the price a decent buy but room for improvement.
4,Good for the most part.,"I am technically a medium, but the large fits better. The medium was a bit too tight, so if you think you are a medium on maybe the larger side of medium, go for a large. The look of the helmet is nice. I would recommend it."
2,DVD in Spanish with no English subtitles,"The movie is in Spanish. I have rented it before and viewed it with English subtitles. Now I bought the DVD for my own library, but unfortunately there are no English subtitles. There was no indication of that fact on the web site when I bought the DVD. I e-mailed the store about the problem, but never heard from them."
5,Just Plain Delightful!,"This is one of the most delightful books about my favorite breed of dog that I have EVER read! I love beagles and as the owner of a beagle thoroughly enjoyed this one. The lovable Queen Beagle and her beautiful puppies are sure to delight all who read this book. In fact, the Queen Beagle reminded me of my own lovable hound dog.Each character brings fun and smiles to the story and readers of all ages will love it!"
5,These treats are great for hiding pills,"I have a cat that has hyperthyroid disorder. Unfortunately, he does not like the Greenies Pill Pockets. He just eats around the pill and will spit the pill out. I found the Defurr-UM treats are perfect. He loves the crunchy texture. I break the treat in half and push the pill into the gooey middle. It helps to give a non-pill treat first, then the pill treat, and while he's eating the pill treat I give another non-pill treat under his nose on the floor to make sure he swallows his pill. Works like a charm every time. Plus Defurr-UM treats are cheaper than the pill pockets. It's a must have in my home."
2,Cats don't approve,"My cats have a lot of hariballs, as many a few a week. I was hopeful that these would work some magic on the problem yet neither of cats would give these a try. The cats looked at treats, seeminlgly uninterested, gave a little sniff, and walked away. They rejected the snacks. I tried sneaking it into their food but stil no luck. It's almost as though my cats know it's medicine, and therefore they avoid it.I've been able to get them to eat another brand of hairball treats called temptations, but I'm not sure if it's been effective at reducing their hairballs.Guess it was too good to be true that a kitty treat could work any magic on their hairballs."
1,Cat wouldn't go near it,"Unfortunately despite the positive reviews, my cat turned his nose to this product. These treats have a extremely strong soy sauce like scent to them.He wouldn't even go near it when I would leave it on the steps where he normally eats his snacks.Oh well. I guess it's always trial and error."
4,Defurr-ums for Tinkerbell,"Our Cat Tinkerbell loves cat treats (which cat does not?) and also has a problem with hair balls. Our veternerian recommended the Defurr-um treats. She likes them and has much less problems with her hair balls. Her coat looks better also. Sincerely, Means Johnston III"
1,package we got was dried out and no good,I really don't know what the product is suppose to be like or if it works. When we opened the package they didn't smell very appealing and our cat had zero interest in them. The picture on the package indicates the centers should be soft and rather liquid. When we cut one in half the ones we received seemed dried out and somewhat hollow in the middle. It may be the package was old or defective. We did not try to return them but just disposed of them.
5,James Stewart Westerns,"All of these films are good and a couple are classics. One of the best boxed sets I've ever purchased. Good price too.Try them, you'll like them."
4,movies,I enjoyed all the movies I've gotten so far and am very pleased. So far I have had a good experience dealing with Amazon.
5,jimmie stewart,an excellent collection of western films depicting a lifetime of great work by one of our best known actors.
3,Not His Best,This collection is just passable for Jimmy Stewart fans.Only Destry Rides Again is 5 stars. Rare Breed is 1 star. The others fall in between.
5,Belgian Chocolate Rooibos loose tea,"I have truly enjoyed this tea. I drink it most every day and it helps me to relax. It is not meant to be a weight loss tea, but since I have started I have noticed great changes in my body weight and inches. It has a great chocolate taste and with that taste helps me not to go for foods that are chocolate and not good for me.I will definetely order this product again. It give me lots of energy too.I do wish for my next order the shipping not to be so high, it really defers me from ordering with the way the economy is these days.Thanks D.G."
4,Ahhhh Scary!,"After listening to this for the first time I immediately thought I should go to church. But putting that aside, this is a great CD that just gushes evil. The guitar riffs shred and the drum work is awesome. Also Glen Benton is a very good and original vocalist. If you get past the cheesy lyrics this is a definate headbanging CD."
5,Still a favorite,"I got out of listening to death metal several years ago, and this is the one death metal album I find myself still listening to now and then. Unquestionably their greatest work, and the best in the ""Death Metal"" genre. A must buy for anyone looking for something hard and heavy."
3,Why do people stoop this low?,I'm into metal but I also belive in the Son of God. I wonder if deicide would have the courage to Blaspheme the Holy Spirit. I'm sure they would not. They would only face there puppet master whome they thought was there gift on this earth.
4,Woah,"This album is super fast, super evil, super heavy, and really cool. I would even call it essential, as it is a great embodiment of everything that is great about Death metal. Classic."
5,DEATH METAL CLASSIC !,"To basically sum this album up, one could only say...""And the serpant said nothing, just grinned with knowledge."" Hail Deicide"
3,I don't understand,"I don't understand, I agree with the other person that said who would have the courage to blaspheme God? I like heavy metal, but i don't agree with alot of their lyrics. deicide has some cool music, but they need to think about where they're coming from. BUt aside from that, if you like satanism, than this is your c.d."
2,Over rated but okay,"Deicide's debut is one of the biggest titles mentioned in death metal circles. I bought it one strength of reputation, as I did with At The Gates... At The Gates proved very worthy of their fame, Deicide on the other hand were just okay. They're a good band, the music is quite aggressive at time's. But at others it's just plain boring. Their is little sense of melody or technicality here, just monotonous thrashing and growling. Hey, don't get me wrong, I love thrashing and growling, but these guys sound very samey. It's hardly distinctive. Perhaps thats because pretty much every other American death metal band tried to rip them off afterwards, but it does sound cliched. I was expecting something really distinctive, but it's nuthin that hasn't been done better by other bands. If you're gonna go with an American death metal band i'd go with either Death (for melody and structure) or Cannibal Corpse (for sickness, brutality, and un-melody and un-structure)."
5,Hail Satan! Hail Glen Benton!,"This album is the best album that you can buy for Satan worshipping. If your not a Satanist, or if your just a ""wannabe"" Satanist, I suggest you not even listen to it. If your into ""hardcore"" death/black metal I suggest you buy this album, it is a WELL put togeather peice of art,..."
1,Worst Death Metal Album Of All Time?,"...at least its somewhat laughable. Deicide embody every known cliche the underground has to offer. Talentless guitar playing, ridiculous and childish lyrics, god-awful vocals that sound like a possessed Linda Blair trying to impersonate Satan... Its all here. One of the worst Death Metal albums ever! The band is a complete and utter joke."
1,Still Better than anything lUKE hURRLE (wORLE) likes,"These vocals suck, how can anyone tell the difference between all these Death Metal bands when their vocals are all the same.Oh well, the vocals are still better than anything Billy corgan ever sang, I'll give them that."
4,very cool,"This is a very cool album. it's very diffrent from insineratehymn which is the only other i own. this is pretty raw and in my opinion you cant hear what the guitars are doing unless you listen very carefully. but this is a very cool album from the best death metal band in the world so just press ""add to cart"" now. my personal favs. are deicide and crusafixation."
2,A long freaking book,"The Talisman was a book that was written for people who like fantasy. This is not a darn horror novel. The book starts out boring and get's good when the character Wolf comes in. The hero of the book Jack was not a character I liked. When it came time to read about him most of the time I was bored out my brain.Stephen King couldn't have written this book, it seems like Peter Straub wrote the bulk or this wordy book. A lot of the descriptions were not needed and 735 pages was not worth it. I liked reading about the character's Twinners. I also liked reading about Lily, Morgan sloat and Sunlight Gardner. I was dissappointed in Stephen King. This book took me 2 1/2 months to read and I won't be reading the sequel."
4,An interesting look at all things nocturnal,"Being the night owl that I am, this book certainly caught my eye. Plus, there's the cutest little kitty on the front cover, not to mention mice (what IS it about the mice in childrens' books? There's something so endearing about them). This brightly-colored book shows children what happens at each hour of the night and early morning in the city (ok, we're talking about industrious people here, not street bums). There's a lot of great information which will open their eyes to the world at night, but I like all the little details: a clock on each page, little mice hiding throughout the book (performing the funniest antics!) and best of all, the view from a window bearing a remarkable resemblance to Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"". The bold illustrations are certainly a plus, inviting kids to read through this one over and over again."
2,Bleh... Not so great,"It looks like a good idea, but really isn't. Get a brush with a long handle. The brush is more versatile, and easy to maintain. This thing isn't convenient to store, and I found it a little too abrasive. I like my bath brush and sea sponge so much better than this thing."
1,Not a smart product,"I was inclined to buy this belt scrubber because it was made from natural fibers, etc. But I had to throw it away after less than one month because it started gowing mildew. Unlike a sponge which you could sqeeze to keep it fairly dry after use, the fibers in this belt scrubber are really coarse and retain a lot of water. There was no easy way to dry it out between uses, so the mildew grew and grew."
5,Dare to Dream!!,"This product was excellant. I have used it for 4 months now and find very little at fault with it. I use the 500 for work and usully put in over 20 addresses a day, it always gets me there! It takes a little time to learn but it is like any other electronic device; to use it properly you must READ THE MANUAL. don't listen to the negative reviews of people who couldn't get it to work right because they were to impatient to read the manual."
3,Enjoyed but slightly comical,The movies are very old and kind of comical.I enjoyed the Gideon film the most.
3,Judo Champion as Biblical Strongman,"As a longtime judo practioner and fan of sport judo I've wanted to see this film for some time.Recently a friend purchased it for me from Amazon as a present.It stars Anton Geesink,the first non-Japanese to win the world judo championship,as the biblical strongman Samson.The herculean(6'6"" 260lb.)Geesink actually does a credible job portraying the tragic hero.The film itself is a retelling of the story of Samson and his betrayl at the hands of the temptress Delilah.Not done on the same epic scale as Cecil B.De Mille's classic starring Victor Mature this film and it's companion feature about Gideon seems to have been made for Sunday School audiences and not regular theatre patrons.It's still a good entertainment and it was interesting to see the Olympic and World Champion in action.It makes you wonder why no one thought to cast him in one of the gladiator-type movies that were popular at the time this film was being made."
4,Great book,I've read all three of the sexual healing books and their all great. I wish there was a fourth book. This one was my favorite though. The story was great and out of the ordinary. I've definitely become a fan of the author.
4,Hits the Spot!,"While this is the third book in the series, it's the first I've read and it'll have me hunting down the others.I really like the unique theme of this story - the idea of sexual healing. It's not something I've read before and it can be rare these days to find something different so that alone would earn it 4 stars.Add to the unique theme characters that are well written and easy to connect with and you have a winner. You could really feel the struggle that both of the main characters were going through and I formed an emotional connection to them which made their story painful to read.This one is definitely high on my list of recommended books and re-readability and I'm looking forward to reading the others in the series as well as different books by this author."
2,"Not flawless, but it covers.","If you order this kit, make sure you have time to practice with it! It takes several practice applications to get the shade just right. While it does cover completely, it is not flawless. You can tell that you've covered something up on your skin. If it's not a big deal, you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup cover it for you with this kit."
3,decent product,"this is a decent product for covering tattoos. i've tried a few different lines of make-up, and this works the best. takes time and more than 3 layers, but works. color is a bit off, and others can tell that you're covering something up..."
3,"Good, but not great mystery","I really don't understand why this book won so many awards. The characters are unique-with a female Episcopal priest (Clare Ferguson) partnered up with the Chief of Police (Russ van Alstyne). They're both ex-army, and some of their conversations are quite appealing. The mystery revolves around an abandoned child left at the door of Clare's church. When the teenage mother turns up dead, the search for the father commences. When suspicions of incest arise, the girl's father is murdered as well. But the ending is just too incredible, with Clare diving after a baby who was thrown in the water by the murderer. Good set-up, but the ending falls through."
4,"Terrific mystery, interesting protagonists","The protagonists in this mystery are realistic and people you might like to know. The skill set the priest brings makes a fast paced action mystery possible. She is in the tradition of Nevada Barr with the interesting vocation of the priesthood. I'm glad to see that this is a series, I will probably read them all!"
4,in the bleak midwinter,"drama setting& characters are well placed and story developed interestingly, just describing the situation was too long and flat taking out of crimax. like ending, should be short and give reader wanting more. Othewise I enjoyed the book very much."
2,It's not bad but it's not good.,"I found Reverend Clare totally annoying. She had no business playing (fairly stupid) cop; the supposed sexual tension was way out of line. Single young female priest do not hang around endlessly alone with a married man. The amount of dinners and rides she had with the lonesome police chief would have her booted out of a small town parish in a flash. Couldn't they just have a platonic friendship? Her constant meddling in the murder case was laughable, her near demise, ridiculous. The writing style was okay but it wasn't enough to make me like this book. A very medium effort."
3,nothing to write home about,I was able to finish this one but it won't stay with me. I didn't feel much of a connection to the characters and wondered if a minister/priest would really get that involved or spend that much time with a married cop she didn't even know in a town she had just moved to. It didn't seem likely to me. I don't think I'll read any more of this series.
5,Let it snow!,"When a vicar, new to a small rural New York State town finds a newborn bundled in blankets on her church's doorstep, the web of greed, abuse & murder begins to unravel.Make way for a new crime-solving duo in the world of mysteries. The modern priest & police chief are richly drawn characters with histories to tell.I agree with everyone else's observations about inappropriate blunders, however, they detract only a tad from a well-written story.Julia Spencer-Fleming's debut IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER has a wry sense of humor, hair raising adventures while telling a tale of what moves people to do horrible & brave things.RebeccasReads recommends IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER for a fine, thoughtful mystery"
3,in The Bleak Midwinter,"The novel begins when a baby is found on the steps of a church in the middle of a snowy winter. While investigating whose baby it is, the Chief of Police, Russ Van Alstyne and Claire Ferguson, the female priest of said church discover that the young mother was murdered.As the story unfolds, the reader gets to learn more about Claire and Russ. These characters are well developed and have a chemistry that makes their investigation fun to read. I found this to be an enjoyable mystery."
5,In the Bleak Midwinter,"Great first entry in an appealing ""cozy"" mystery series. This book features 2 interesting protagonists and a town filled with an assortment of local characters. Lots of fun."
2,Meh,"As a mystery lover and avid reader, I had high hopes for this book - especially based on the reviews here. What I wound up reading was simplistic writing and dialogue that made me wonder if this writer was straining to guess how an actual conversation would go in the situations presented in the story. If you had a hard day at work, read this to unwind. If you want to read a book for adults, find another author."
4,All the elements we love,"Julia Spencer-Fleming clearly realizes what makes a good serial - a little hint of forbidden love, of course. The tantalizing relationship between Claire Ferguson, her main-character former-helicopter-pilot-current-priest, and Russ Van Alstyne, married chief of police, keeps us coming back for more. This series is well-written, dramatic, entertaining, and complex - neither the author nor her characters shy away from timely sociatal issues nor the ambiguous fraility of the human heart.The books are taunt without being gruesome, gripping but not terrifying. In short, highly recommended. I foist this book, the first in the series, off on all of my friends and they all come back to read the second, and the third, and the fourth..."
3,Our book club read this...,"Most of us could not find the characters believable. Her descriptions of the landscapes and the feeling of winter in upstate New York were very good. Clare, the main character, was not at all credible. This is the first book in a series and I will not be reading any others."
5,Holy Cow...this is great!,"This is the kind of book that makes you sit up and take notice of a writer's talent. Julia Spencer-Fleming has not only written an awesome book, she has introduced us to people that we can care about and admire.Clare Fergusson is a classic heroine for our time. She is caring and responsible and yet so human in her flaws. The relationships she builds with the other characters in this book are so real.Julia Spencer-Fleming has a talent for bringing the reader into the surroundings--her description is vivid and mesmerizing. You can see and feel and smell everything around the characters...it's like being there. This book was an emotional high with the potential for sensory overload.Excellently crafted and perfectly implemented."
1,Extremely annoying!,"While this book was well-written and I did finish it, it was way too improbable to be believed.No law officer would allow a civilian to continually accompany him on his duty, especially when there was danger involved, or allow her to continually interfere in an investigation without even letting him know what she was doing. No married law officer and unmarried priest would spend so much time alone together in compromising situations in a small town where everybody knows them and get away with it. No supposedly savvy and well-trained woman would remain in inappropriate clothing and transportation throughout the whole book or rush into dangerous situations alone and unprepared and without telling anyone where she was going, or confront potential bad guys with everything she knows without any protection or backup. Characters and atmosphere: interesting. Plot: totally ridiculous."
4,The 1st CD from Leeb & Peterson under Intermix,This is the first CD release by Leeb and Peterson under their side project banner of 'Intermix'. Bill Leeb is more synonimous with his partnership with Rhys Fulber in FLA and Delerium. Intermix is the creation from the mind of one talented Bill Leeb who had brought on Chris Peterson who is a well known mixer of industrial and ambient themes. This album was initially released in 1992 by Third Mind Records and being 13 years later this album still is powerful and mind-boggling in execution and sound. This CD is a 8 track album release covering every aspect of industrialized electronica with several songs dwelving into a soft techno beat. What makes this CD so that much better is the inclusion of Fulber in the last three tracks - they feel and sound a tad darker and has a Delerium feel to the songs. This side project was one of the most successful in their careers with Bill Leeb's other side project 'Pro>Tech' being the best.
2,Boring light techno,"Wow, the original Intermix album! Maybe it will be of the same creative caliber as Phaze Two, which I found a mind-blowing ""intermix"" of urban, techno, and industrial sounds.But no. Basically boring light techno, only S+M=Y being worth listening to a second time on account of some industrial flavor to it."
2,Where's the action?,"This book started well with Gunny Bass returning to the 34th FIST but it trails off from there. There was very little combat and when there was, it was very sporadic.The dialogue and the innards of the Marine relationships was outstanding as always, but I felt that the perspectives were too diluted. The point of view seemed to come from every single fire team leader, squad leader, platoon leader. It made the whole story, well boring.I would have given it 3 stars but I've also compared it with the other books in the series and that is why I've dropped it down to 2 stars.I will continue to read this book because I feel a major conflict brewing between the 34th FIST and the SKINKS."
3,Too much hype!,I thought I would get great coverage with this concealer and I did for about a half an hour- then it faded and settled into lines even with eye cream! I gave it 3 stars for the color and value. The color was perfect!
3,Not too bad; Sheila Keith is clearly the star,"Servicable Brit horror entry in the early '70s about an elderly couple who was put away several years ago for cannibalism; the husband wants to put it behind him but the wife (Sheila Keith) can't help but lure visitors with promises of Tarot readings, which turn out, of course, to be dinner with the guests on the menu. And their 2 daughters are in the thick of it. Keith is lots of fun in this Pete Walker entry, which is miles better than his House Of Whipcord (also starring Keith). Not very gory, as British critics might try to persuade you to believe (only slightly cut for VHS release), and not great either, but worthwhile for Keith's enjoyable performance. Should be remade someday, with more gore, of course."
1,Uneventful and boring Film,"I am startled to see that there are hardly any 'negative' reviews ofthis routine film, on the advice of the positive reviews I bought thefilm and was utterly taken aback at how boring and amateurish itlooked.The start looked promising, an eerie promenade at an abandonedcarnival but then it went downhill from there. Most of the screen timeis taken up by inexperienced actors who can't hold a scene together and the story is tepid and unworthy for a long feature. Nothing ever reallyhappens and there are no scary moments or plot elements that make usshudder. The 'murders' look fake and are exaggerated to the point ofridiculousness. I kept waiting for something startling to happen but itnever did, just banter between dull British folk. Avoid this at allcosts."
3,"Lots of fun, pretty scary","This Brit slasher flick created some chills. The story concerns a grandmotherly type being released from an insane asylum because she is cured. Any fan of this genre can tell right away that the cure didn't take as granny gets her jollies making people bloody. The film creates a few tense moments and there are some scenes of gore; however, it's a BIG strech to compare it to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". This film is not a horror classic, but if you just want cheap '70's drive in shocker trash then this one is recommended. The DVD plays well, full screen, nice sound but has no extras."
1,Defective copy,?he copy of frightmare from the box set is problematic. Pixelisation and skipping start at 46:05 and through the second half. Pete walker collection-shriek show. I could not watch. A dissappointment!!!!!
4,Industrial techno at its' greatest,"Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber are two of the greatest musical geniouses of our time. I am a fan of all their work: FLA, Noise Unit, Delerium, Synestasia, and Intermix. They are masters of industrial and techno and can easily blend the two. They combine heavy beats with samples and metallic sounds and just about anything else.( By the way, any fan of Consolidated will definitely appreciate the track ""Funky Hell"")"
5,Doughnuts and crack,"I came to this one after ""Every Dead Nanny"" and ""Happy Never After"" so for once I'm reading a series in the right order. I thought this was the best of the three. The plot is believable from beginning almost to the end (I never quite buy those heroine-save-in-the-nick-of-time scenes but they seem obligatory in this female private eye genre which is a descendant of romantic suspense). It unfolds piece by piece rather than being a series of interviews and the murderer is the kind of surprise that has you turning back pages and saying ""why didn't I think of that?"" Some great writing. I loved a scene where she describes a vivid temptation to buy Krispy Kreme doughnuts and then looks across the street and describes a crack-buying transaction."
5,LOVE THIS WRITER!,"I have read every book of Kathy Hogan Trocheck /Mary Kay Andrews. Never disappointed.... I want more! Please keep writing the Callahan Garrity Mysteries, and LOVE LOVE LOVE ... Weezie and Bebe........ The books are a fun and transporting read!!!Great!"
3,I really wanted to like this book but I couldn't,"I was looking for something that would show the Atlanta I know and love, but the main character just was too self-righteous; one who appears to be so open minded, but had clearly never even considered riding a MARTA bus. The plot idea was original, but I was not suprised by the ending given the main character's leanings. I loved the descriptions of the area and all the other characters; they were all so more grounded in reality. If the author considers writing about them and less about her heroine, I'll definitely read it."
1,Pompous Pseudo-Intellectual Babble,"This book is absolute proof that it is possible to create a connection between any concepts, no matter how strained, nonsensical, or fabricated that connection may be.Pompous pseudo-intellectual babble and ultimately a waste of time and paper."
4,"There's a lot here, some of it very good, some not.","Clearly not your typical rock an roll book, which tend to fall into the categories of either poorly written self-aggrandizing ""autobiographies"", or breathless anecdotes from managers, groupies, hangers-on, etc. Ben Watson's book is a thoughtful examination of Frank Zappa's lyrics and the overall meaning of his career.Sadly, the book does not devote as much attention to Zappa's music, which most people would consider far more significant than the lyrics. Although many reviewers point out Watson's farcically ""deep"" reading of Zappa's lyrics, it is his relative disinterest in the music which is the book's greatest stumbling block.That being said, there is an awful lot for hardcore Zappa fanatics to chew on here. In the end it's certainly worth the effort."
1,Psuedo-intellectual tripe,"God, how I hated this book. I'm been a huge FZ fan since the '60s; have everything he's ever put out (& then some); but if I had read this book first I would never have even given him a listen. This book is more about Mr. Watson showing off his psuedo-intellectual prowess than it is about Frank Zappa. Mr. Watson attempts to psycho-analyze every word FZ wrote when FZ himself said that on most songs his lyrics existed solely to highlight the music. FZ would spend weeks writing the music then dash out the lyrics in a half hour. Mr. Watson has certainly researched FZ's music but he has researched it to death, attributing the lyrics with all sorts of hidden meaning. Come on! 'Sometimes a banana is just a banana'."
1,exactly what frank was talking about,"If there was one thing that FZ hated, it was critics. Frank hated them because they didn't understand what he was doing. Frank hated them for not understanding music in general. But mostly frank hated them because as the old adage says: those who can, do; those who can't, teach; and those who can't teach, criticize.While this is a wonderfully written book, it is a critics view of Zappa. It expounds on the meanings Frank might have intended in his work, yet many of its quotations can be found in ""The Real Frank Zappa Book."" If you want to know what Zappa was really about, get that book, not ""The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play."" Better to get information from the man himself, instead of through the eyes of a critic."
5,Excellent resource,I especially enjoy all the back stories on Zappa's incredibly creative approach to his music.
3,"Heavy on the esoteric, light on the music","I enjoyed this book, although I must admit that many of the references were lost on me. Like Frank's work, its a very deep and analytical book. The focus is more on each album and era as whole. And while many of the tracks are discussed, many are not. I would have preferred this to be more focused on the individual songs, their origins, and some of the musicianship, lyrics, and the process of the writing and producing of each song, or at least for some of the more important tracks. This book focuses more on Frank's influences, themes, and connections to other sources. All in all a good read, but I was hoping for something that was more of a reference for information about the Zappa catalog instead of essentially one long esoteric essay."
2,Watch out Ben! The poodle bites.,I hope no one will ever read this and take it seriously. Somehow I have a hard time thinkin Frank would be impressed with this self-indulgent intellectual nonsense. I will give Ben credit for be slightly amusing. Anyone who has read this book should visit Mike Keneally's web site. He has carefully pointed out all of the misinformation contained within this pompous tome. Good job Mike!
4,stalking the crux of the cookie,"If you have read this far then you are probably enough of a fan to get a deep kick out of this book. It is...thorough. It is detailed, dense and it delivers. I was greatly enlightened as to the nature of Frank's conceptual continuity.Frank loved it, so did I."
5,"This Blu-Ray release rated against your DVD called ""Queen: We Will Rock You""","Well, to be honest, it is the same concert. It's just that Pioneer/Mobilevision released the DVD of ""We Will Rock You"", and EagleVision HD released the Blu-Ray version.The introductions appear differently at the beginning and end. One the WWRY DVD, Queen and the artists names are in big bold pink print, where as, on the Blu-ray release of Rock Montreal and Live Aid, it's in simple smaller white print.But, the concert is pretty much all the same. There may be a couple of different camera angles here and there, but nothing truly too much different between these two releases. I thought that the regular DVD of WWRY looks pretty good, even comparing back to back with this Blu-ray release. So honestly, buying the Blu-Ray release of ""Rock Montreal and Live Aid"" to replace your DVD of ""We Will Rock You"" really is totally unnecessary. They both look pretty good."
5,A prize possession for any Queen fan,"Amazing !!!!!! The only negative for me was the Montreal audience wasn't as passionate as I would have been! A flawless performance from Queen for sure. Although the video quality of the Live Aid segment didn't match the Montreal concert ..... the sheer magic of the event and the response from the audience and ""back stage guys"" was extremely emotional for me. This DVD is the pride of my Blu-ray collection"
4,Great if yours Queens fan,Some very good songs and the Blue Ray dvd is more than decent. I enjoyed it but not as good as Elton or Roy Orbison
2,scratched,Mine arrive with a scratch - says trying to skip over error on the disk. Right at the end too.Carolyn
5,easy 5 stars,"how can anyone give this DVD less than 5 stars?...A great Queen performance in montreal, and their legendary ""live aid show"" in one package."
5,Sound is Incredible. Picture is too!,This concert is excellent. Clear picture. Amazing sound. A true Queen masterpiece to watch over and over again. It is like you are transported back to the 1981 concert in the front row watching Freddie give yet another stellar performance.
3,Mixed bag,"The content is AWESOME. Live concerts dont get any better or historic as this. That being said, the VHS quality of this was sad and difficult to watch."
4,Killer Queen!,"The Montreal concert is a killer! Freddy Mercury is really a star performer, and so are the other members of the band. The Live Aid concert is a great bonus... that part where the audience was clapping their hands in unison for Radio Gaga just shows you how much influence the band had on the people back then. Great stuff!Now, why only 4 stars? The concert was great but of course the video was not taken to take advantage of the HD quality that current systems now have to offer. The video was grainy at best and parts of the Live Aid coverage had green bands showing. Not sure what the DVD version has to offer (in terms of content) but this is not an HD/blu-ray material.Anyway, I recommend this video to everyone... especially those who were already alive and kickin' back in the 80s. My friends and I had a great time watching the concert over a few bottles of San Migs."
2,Queen: Rock Montreal & Live Aid [Blu-ray],I knew it was an old concert but both the audio & video quality were not up to my standards.
2,Not impressed,"I know this was taken from old footage, but I was not impressed with the quality of the audio or video considering this was a blu-ray transfer.Compared to Roy Orbison - Black and White Night (5 stars)"
3,2 or 3 Good Songs,"While admittedly live performances are just that, live, I still dislike it when the lead singer feels the need to vary from the original recording. What I hear first is what I think it should always be and Freddie Mercury chose to accessorize the songs and the differences were annoying to me, but that is just me. If you aren't that familiar with the songs you won't notice any problems."
4,A Concert For Keeps,"My wife and I never got to know Freddie Mercury when he was alive. We only learnt about him through what people had presented through the internet and through the tribute concerts we got to attend. Seeing the concert in hi-def really brought the concert to our living room. My wife enjoyed every minute of it and we got to see the through showman that Freddie Mercury was. And to quote her ""Freddie still rocks and he will sorely be missed.""An in-movie menu allows you to choose the song in the concert to go to. Pity that the extra material was not in HD, and the repertoire of songs did not include their iconic song ""I Want To Break Free"". Else it would have really been a jukebox of Queen's best. Well, at least in my books. But all in all a keeper that all Queen fans should have in their library."
4,Great video quality for something shot back in 1981,I recommend this Bluray.....for something shot in 1981 the video is amazing. Great songs. There is however a lot of grain...but hey its from 1981.
4,Winding the Clock Back,"I was not a Queen fan until I saw a portion of their 2008 Ukraine show with Paul Rodgers on DirecTV. I liked that well enough to buy that DVD, and it is now a favorite. So I wanted to wind the clock back and see how they were when Freddie was their lead singer. This DVD is smashing. Freddie was waaaay over the top, but an amazing performer. He had an excellent voice that he shows off nicely here, along with good piano action. After first seeing them in the 2008 show, seeing this 1981 show put Queen in better perspective for me. Freddie could have been a top Broadway star if he had lived. What a loss. As others have already said, the video and audio quality on this are top notch. And Freddie was in great form."
5,"queen will,queen will rock you!!!","This concert is amazing. The picture and sound quality are just awesome. This is the tour for The Game, and it has everything from their 1st album up to and including The Game...which i consider their last great cd...definitly worth getting the concert dvd...with bonus Live-Aid performance...This concert dvd is probably one of the best ones in my collection."
3,Remasterd?,"One big question. Who said this album needs to be remaster?This is one of the most natural sounding albums there is, meaning you dont hear compression or equalisation. You could hear the minimalistic micking technique that Rob Eaton used only 10 years ago in the first full 24 bits album.You should write who does the remaster if that is so important."
1,Another piece of junk from RCA,I bought this thing in December of 2002 for $650. It was manufactured in October of 2002. In December 2004 it started making a strange sound whenever it was plugged in. Estimate to repair is over $400 because of a bad flyback transformer.I think I'll just throw it on Circuit City's front steps.
2,"Great Tape, For A While","I work in a frame shop and bought a pair of these. This tape has been used daily, tossed around, dropped, and about everything you can do to a tape measure. The mechanism worked flawlessly (which I have gotten use to).......for about 6 months, until the blade tip snapped off at the first rivet. You usually see this in very old tape measures. Cannot find replacement blades so I tossed it. One still works so I gave it two stars instead of one."
3,Time capsule,"This book is a time capsule for the time it was published, having advice that isn't specifically relevant any more (how to travel with glass bottles, how to teach kids about the cold war, etc) but still contains gems of practical advice."
4,Delightful music inspired by Rumi's enlightened poetry,"If, as I do, you love the poetry of Rumi and other great Sufi masters this beautiful collection of songs will come as a boundless treasure of love, inspiration and magic inviting you to join Rumi on his spiritual journey. Mischa Rutenberg is not only a very talented composer and musician, he also has a voice that dispells clouds and sings directly to the heart. Listen to this album with family and friends; or play it in your car on your way to work: your day will have no nights! Although I value night as much as day - especially since many of Rumi's spritual wanderings took place under the Persian moon..."
1,A great disappointment.,Very disappointed with these renditions of Rumi's poetry. I also wondered if the other reviews were written by friends of Mischa Rutenburg. TERRIBLE!
4,great book but lacks application problem,"Great book but lacks application problems. I am told this book is more for an indepth analysis of topics already learned from other coureses with the addition of Observers,state observer feedback, Intro to the use of Kalman filters, state variable feedback, and optimization. The optimization section could be better but if you have a great teacher its a good reference. I had used this book as an undergrad and told its a reference for grad students."
3,If this is the best of I'd hate to see the rest,It wasn't that bad but it wasn't that great either. I was expecting UFC level fights and I shouldn't of. They had some big name fighters and a few good fights. The main fight I wanted to see was the Leben fight. That fight wasn't even that great. For 10 bucks its not a bad buy though. I quess I'm kinda glad I bought it because its a nice add to my fight collection but if I could do it all again I wouldn't buy it.
1,There is one good song,"The rest of it is made up of somewhat interesting hooks, unfortunate timing changes and lyrics an orangutan on Rohypnol probably could have come up with. Ugh and he's the talented one."
5,UNQUESTIONABLY THE BEST OF THE SOLO ALBUMS,"I LOVE THIS CD, I ACTULLY LOVED IT WHEN I HAD IT ON 8 TRACK TAPE IN THE 70'S. THE SONGS ARE PURE ROCK AND THE GUITAR WORK IS FANTASTIC. SOMETIMES SPACEY, BUT ALWAYS FUN. ALTHOUGH PAUL STANLEY'S SOLO EFFORT ISN'T A TOTAL LOSS, MOST OF THE MATERIAL THAT IT CONTAINS SOUNDS OUTDATED. WITH CHEESY BALLADS AND LAME ATTEMPTS AT ROCK ANTHEMS. IT HASN'T STOOD THE TEST OF TIME THE WAY FREHLEY'S ALBUM DID. GENE SIMMONS AND PETER CRISS SOULD HAVE MADE AN EFFORT TO KEEP THEIR ALBUMNS OUT OF PRINT, BOTH ARE MISGUIDED, BORING, AND VERY HARD TO LISTEN TO(ESPECIALLY PETER'S). BESIDES FEELING THAT THIS DISC IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER SOLO ALBUMNS, I THINK IT IS BETTER THAN ANY OF THE KISS ALBUMNS THAT FOLLOWED IT, FROM DYNASTY TO PSYCHO CIRCUS. ACE'S VERSION OF ""NEW YORK GROOVE"" ALONE MAKES THIS ALBUMN WORTH OWNING. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AM A HUGE KISS FAN AND THIS REVIEW COMES STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART!"
4,"Good Rocking Album, but it has its limits","Overall, Ace's solo album is pretty good but not the best of the solo efforts. Ace proves himself to be an excellent song-writer and pretty good singer as well. In spite of the fact that he is responsible for putting guitars into the hands of multitutes of kids and providing inspiration, it has to be stated that he is really only marginal as a lead guitarist. This is not meant to play down the impact that he had made. He has survived the test of time and will always be considered to be one of the greatest and most influential players of all time. Unfortunately, his later solo efforts would prove his limitations as evidenced by his use of the same ""boxed-in"" stale, repetitious limited vocabulary of licks. Paul Stanley was correct in his assessment of Ace's playing when he described his ""Jimmy Page-ish"" style that simply failed to develop. This continued all the way through the Comet days to Trouble Walkin' and into the modern reunion era."
5,Stands the test of time!,"This is not only the best of the 4 solo albums (as everyones seems to agree), but this one still sounds as fresh and cutting edge today as it did back then. Ace is the best! The words 'eternally cool' come to mind. I enjoy each and EVERY song so much here. I don't think I can say that about all of the original albums by the entire band (and KISS is my fav alltime American band). Can I say enough? Even if you're not into KISS, but love classic rock/guitar rock--- you must own this one. Side note: My 4 yr old daughter heard Fractured Mirror yesterday and I didn't say who it was playing, she just looked at me and said 'Dad I really like that music!' --- that's my girl!"
4,Ace Delivers The Goods,"Of the four solo albums Ace's was the biggest surprise due to the success of the Russ Ballard penned New York Groove. The album was produced by Eddie Kramer who had previously worked with Kiss on Rock And Roll Over and Loved Gun. Perhaps that's one of the reasons Ace's album sounds the most like Kiss next to Paul's album. As expected there is plenty of rockin guitar from the Spaceman. My favorite tracks are Rip It Out, Speedin Back To My Baby, What's On Your Mind (love the chorus!), New York Groove, and the excellent instrumental Fractured Mirror (which would later give birth to Fractured II and III). Paul's album is still my favorite but Ace's is a close second. Get em both if you don't have them already!"
3,A cool and lively album.,"I've always liked this debut solo album from Ace Frehley. I remember first getting the record many years ago when I was a kid. Ace Frehley was my first guitar hero. There's a total of nine tracks on this disc. I find every track to be good and energetic. The musical direction of the album is straight-ahead hard rock. Eight of the tracks are straight-ahead hard rockers, and the other one is an instrumental (""Fractured Mirror""). The musicianship, songwriting, and production are good. The tracks that I like the most are ""Rip It Out,"" ""Snow Blind,"" and ""Fractured Mirror."" Ace Frehley does a cool job with the guitar playing, and his vocals are good. ""Snow Blind"" sports a catchy guitar riff, and the instrumental ""Fractured Mirror"" is also very nice and enjoyable. I have always liked the cover painting of Ace Frehley, too. This disc is good and worth a listen."
5,"Great LP, How do I buy it in normal vinyl insted of picture vinyl?",I order this LP thinking it was normal vinyl and it was the picture disk that will not play without back ground noise. How can I buy a new black Ace Frehley LP with NO picture on it? Thanks
4,Solid solo effort,"Ace Frehley (1978) was Ace's solo album when each of the four members of Kiss recorded their own separate solo albums in 1978. It's the best album of the four. The album has some cool tracks, such as Rip It Out, Ozone, a remake of New York Groove, Wiped-Out, and the instrumental Fractured Mirror. The music is hard and simple, but the bottom line is that it rocks.I think Ace's voice is pretty good. Kiss should have had him sing a lot more songs. He only sang a few during his time with Kiss. I think it's cool that all four members of Kiss sing songs rather than having just one lead singer. Blue Oyster Cult does the same thing.Overall, this is a solid album that rocks. Ace is a great guitar player. The next best solo album from 1978, in my opinion, was Paul Stanley's."
4,AMAZINGLY ENJOYABLE !!!!!,"Fantastic songwriting, good old-fashioned hard-rock, precise playing. THis is in this package, full of great guitar work by charismatic ACE. The best solo album by Kiss'members."
4,very relaxed and steady sound : Ace is cool !,"I love this album for over 15 years now, and it still keeps me hooked ! Listen again and again to 'New York Groove', 'I'm in need of love' and 'Rip it Out' ! It's the best Kiss solo-album available !"
4,Back in the New York Groove,"Not a bad album at all. A good rock album. Not KISS, not his solo stuff, but a good solid outing nonetheless. This is definitely worth listening to."
5,Great CD,"In 1978, at the height of KISS's popularity, rather than release a new studio album, all four members simultaneously released a solo album. Although critics have often called this nothing more than a gimmick, there is no denying the quality of these recordings. All four albums are well written and crafted. All four members of KISS really put their heart and soul into this project and made a solo album that really reflects their personality. KISS was like a stew, made up of four separate ingredients. The KISS solo albums of 1978 really let you see each member and what it is exactly they brought into KISS.This cd has Ace at his very best.He has released other Cds since but this is is best in my opinion.From start to finish its good.Some of my favorites from the cd are,Speeding Back To My Baby,New York Groove,Rip it out and Ozone."
4,"It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's Ace Frehley","First of all, let me preface why I gave this four stars instead of five. The only reason is that I don't give perfect ratings easily. Plus the rating is my own subjective opinion anyway, obviously. Your mileage may vary. But this is a great album. Paul is obviously a more talented singer but Ace's album is better overall. (No offense, Paul - you still rock! :) I'm not going to try to break this down track by track, others have done that already. But if you're a KISS fan at all you should have this album, and Paul's too."
3,"It's rather good, but surely not a masterpiece","Kiss fans are very loyal and Ace Frehley is many fan's favorite member. That might blur the judgement regarding this album. I wouldn't say it's a bad album because it's not. ""Speeding back to my baby"" and ""New York groove"" is both very good if not great, and ""Rip it out"" is sure an attractive tune. But overall it's not great and I strongly believe that the proper rating is 3 stars. And even the most dedicated fan can deny that Ace Frehley isn't a good singer."
4,Second Best Kiss solo album,"Ace Frehley is, at best, an excruciatingly mediocre vocalist. This CD however is powerful, energetic and contains some of Ace's greatest compositions ever. Paul Stanley's album outshines it, but Gene and Peter don't even come close. Some great guitar work."
2,Over Rated,"Regarded as the best of the KISS solo efforts, I feel this album isn't that great. The songs lack charisnma, and compare poorly to KISS tracks- Shock Me, Save Your Love, 2000 Man, Rocket Ride and Save Your Love. Though a talented musician and vocalist, I feel the album never gets going and besides New York Groove doesn't offer anything worthwhile. I prefer Paul Stanley and esp. Peter Criss' solo efforts to this."
2,"Not the best album in the world, but neither is this page","Not really many comments for the album. Vocally, Ace was probably the weakest in the band. However, ""New York Groove"" hit during the disco era with it's twangy guitar riffs - great for the period. What I can't believe is the fact that there is no sound clip for the song here. Apparently, it was not an old Kiss fan who wrote this page. ""New York Groove"" made it to #13 in Billboard's 1979 Pop Singles chart.In addition, the Gene Simmons solo effort should be packaged with Ace's efffort for your two-album savings deal. (The Paul Stanley album had no hits that I'm aware of and my Kiss-fan friends & I hated it!) Gene Simmons' ""Radioactive"" only made it to #47 in the same chart during 1979, however the album itself went to #22 in Pop Albums.Just some marketing hints."
4,Easily the best of the Kiss solo albums,"Ace Frehley's self-titled debut is far away the best of the solo albums the members of Kiss released in '78. This is just a great, no-frills rock n' roll album and its good songs and raw production separate it from the uneven solo albums from Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, and Peter Criss.Most of the tracks here are very good and the lyrics reflect the wild times that Ace was living during the band's heyday, particularly the substance references on ""Wiped Out"", ""Ozone"", and ""Snowblind."" The best tracks here are ""Speedin' Back To My Baby"", ""What's On Your Mind?"", ""Rip It Out"", and the instrumental ""Fractured Mirror."" ""New York Groove"" is also a very good track and would become a Top 20 hit. This is clearly Ace's best album and absolutely blows away the faceless hard rock he'd record in the late 80's with Frehley's Comet. Definitely worth checking out."
1,"Commercials, Commercials, Commercials","THIS IS A WASTE OF A DVD. IT SHOULD BE TITLED ""DOUBLE SECRET COMMERCIAL TIME"". What a drag. I've already sent back my copy, and bought an old video copy on ebay. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Product Placement Reigns Supreme,"A classic film like this one deserves so much better. The reason the DVD is called double secret probation edition is that you're forced to sit though tons of ads, without any other option, to get to the meat of the matter. You're on probation, for sure...And then, once you see the movie, you find out that the special fatures meat is like a hot dog: way lots of filler without the beef. If you're looking for good new stuff, you're out of luck.Senator and Mrs. John Blutarsky should launch a senate investigation."
5,A real classic,"I especially enjoyed the biography disc because my yearbook photo is in it. Chris Miller, the co-author of Animal House, was my fraternity brother."
3,"Good Video, Adequate Audio","Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was pretty good, not great. I noticed some grain in a scene or two, which was okay. The picture just wasn't real sharp and clear like a Blu-Ray should be. But, I am satisfied, and don't feal ""ripped off"". I give it an 8.0 out of 10. The aspect ratio is 1.85:1, which filled my widescreen LCD.The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was just okay, nothing special. I didn't notice any surround sound or sub-woofer bass. Everytime I paid attention to the sound, it was coming from the front center speaker. I didn't even notice any sound coming from the front left and right speakers.The movie lasted one hour and 45 minutes. I don't think it is as good as ""The Blues Brothers""."
1,Great Movie - Horrible Ads,"I like this movie. What I absolutely hated was the fact that I had to sitthrough endless (okay, more like 5) minutes of advertisements THAT YOUCANNOT SKIP. It is ridiculous that I have to pay for ads now."
2,What a Commercial piece of Dung!,"From the moment I opened up the DVD case I was let down. The only insert card on the inside case is some coupons to buy some useless [fluff]. No chapter reference card. How cheap can you get. Once I inserted the DVD, another dissapointment. You are forced to watch some [fluff] ""Upcoming"" commercials. These can not be Chapter searched past, fast forwarded, and you can't hit the menu button. This is even worse than Disney releases. At least you can chapter past the commercials. Thanks Universal, for a less then spectacular re-release for a great movie. You should be ashamed."
2,Get the regular edition!,"This rating is for the presentation only, not the film! What do you get for the extra $$$? A box that will sit on your shelf, a softcover booklet with some weak humor, and the movie in a regular snap-case that will find its way into your regular DVD collection(sans oversize box).What could have they done better? Publish the booklet as a mini- hardcover, included some liner notes/essays,vintage ads or reviews,included the CD soundtrack, a shotglass, postcards or some other kind of merch.Pretty half-hearted effort.Save your money and get the regular edition."
5,The Best Ever,It doesn't get any better than this. Where was 'The House' when all those top 100 lists came out. Too many good scenes to count. Go on John - smash that guitar! Did you notice that the check out girl also appears as in Caddyshack as Maggie - the Irish girl who dates Danny Noonan. Bet you didn't know that!
5,This movie rules!,"Even though this movie has it's moments just like any other, John Beushi brings his brilliant acting into the movie resulting in a film that will amuse anyone with a ""twisted"" sense of humor and leave them yellingTOGA!!!!!! TOGA!!!!!"
4,If Looney Tunes Wasn't a Cartoon...,"If Looney Tunes wasn't a cartoon, this movie would be the result. While I went to college in the mid Seventies rather than the mid-Sixties, I can identify with almost every aspect of this movie. I was surrounded by crazy characters who thought nothing of committing insane acts of mayhem for the sheer fun of it. We also seemed to consume massive amounts of alcohol but threw in a large amount of drugs. This is not a movie about being in college. It's a movie about surviving college. In the wildest fashion possible. I love this movie. I've been watching it since it hit the theaters, and I will probably never tire of it. It's a trip down memory lane for me. Just like my book.Bob Wayne, author[...]"
1,i don't even own this,"I don't even own this, but if what the others say is true about forced advertisements and/or previews, then I want on the hatred bandwagon because that sucks hardcore."
1,"Great movie, bad DVD","After reading some of the reviews here, I must say I will not spend a freakin dime on any DVD that forces you to watch advertisements. If anyonewants to purchase this movie, I recommend buying the out of print blue DVD."
2,Ahh!!,"Kevin Bacon's first on-screen credited appearance is in this movie. This is where the legacy of the worst actor in the world started. I heard somewhere that Belushi chugged a bottle of Jack Daniels in this movie, that it really was Jack Daniels, and didn't die. A lot of people would at least have their stomach pumped. Well, I bet this review wasn't terribly helpful."
1,Dreadful,"For those who think that drunkenness, lewdness, and boorishness are the hallmarks of humor, this one is a classic. However, for the civilized, this is a steaming heap of trash, and nothing more."
1,"Um.. so this was the legendary ""Animal House""!","After receiving a flyer from a fellow college student to go toa Toga Spring Break party, I was curious and FINALLY got to see themovie that all of the other college flicks and fraternities pay homage to. I know that I am going against the grain here, but this movie was absolutely horrible! This was one of those movies that had to rely on one star to carry the entire feature. With the exception of Belushi's character, there was very little to actually laugh about, and even fewer characters to care for! Halfway through it, I had to fast forward through all of the other tired and cheap slapstick until I see Belushi's face just to get some laughs out of this! Come on guys! ""Airplane"" was a classic.....""Porky's"" was a classic..."" THE BLUES BROTHERS"" will always be a classic! But ""Animal House"" ! This must be a guy thing."
