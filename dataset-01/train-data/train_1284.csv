5,Beautiful Book,"One of my poems is in this book under the Pen Name ""Adam Elijah Cane"". The World Of Poetry Society was a Society back in the 1980s and 1990s that attracted a real mix of well established and prestigeous writiers and poets, young up and coming talent, celebrities that dabbled in poetry, and some amateur afficionados. It was a nice way to get one's poems read and seen by an audience with standing in the days prior to the Internet Phenomenom. The book is a mix of those that placed at least honorable mention or higher in the society's annual Peotry Contest along with contributions from writers and celebrities like John Updike and Bob Hope among others. A lot of fun if you're into poetry."
1,just bad,This book is obseen just to be so and for no other reson. I wasnt even able to finnish it. One of the worst books I have see.
4,Not typical Dostoyevsky,"This book in NOTHING like any of Dostoyevsky's other works. No rambling mind rants or outside society ""heroes"". Here he writes as if he had gone on vacation. He is informative about the subject, but I must admit he comes across a s quite arrogant,- labeling himself an aristocrat of sorts. You read this and his other works take on a new light. If you like what most would associate Dostoyevsky BEWARE!"
2,"Love Dostoevsky, didn't care for this one.","Wow, it was kind of rough slogging through this work. It generally lacked a plot. I agree that the writing was good, and no one does psychology like Dostoevsky, but I'd really recommend his other books over this one, at least for the casual reader (like myself). I'm fairly compulsive, so I read the entire book, but didn't really enjoy it much. Hope this is helpful. Just my humble opinion."
1,book,I am afraid we cannot review this book as he never received it. I'm sure my father in law would have enjoyed it very much as these type of books are his favorites.
3,a little tweaking,works well but had to make a few modifications to make it work. definitely worth the price and the effort
4,A good survey of Canada's contribution,"Canada's contribution to the Allied war effort in WWII is often overlooked, especially when considering army and air campaigns. Indeed, a good many Canadians served in the British military instead of the Canadian (especially the RAF), and they get lost in the shuffle. Contrasted against that, however, is the fact that the Canadian army had a D-Day beach to itself (Juno), and this army played a major role in the continental campaign that followed (just ask the Dutch and Belgians), not to mention the previous battles in Italy. This book helps to fill the gap in nicely, if in less detail than I would have liked. It is obvious that Bercusen has studied his material. The addition of some photos was a nice touch. Recommended for anyone with an interest in Canada's contribution in the ""last great war."" I look forward to reading his offering on Canada's effort in the Korean War (Blood on the Hills)."
3,He Must Have Been A Big Hit In Europe,"The caption refers to the fact that, in spite of managing just the one lonely North American hit, The Bear Family saw fit to release a Ray Sharp CD with TWENTY-SEVEN selections. All I can say is, this Rockabilly shouter from Texas must have wowed them in Europe.His one big claim to fame on this side of the Atlantic was 1959's Linda Lu which made it to # 11 R&B; and # 46 Billboard Pop Hot 100 for the Jamie label with the backing of Duane Eddy AND Al Casey. That, and the flipside - Red Sails In The Sunset - are both here, accounting for the 3 stars. Otherwise, this is an expensive way for charted hit collectors to seek out the one hit. I'm sure it can be found on a multi-artist compilation which will then, at least, give you several more bona fide hits. Unless, like me, you MUST have both sides."
2,Is 90 minutes really enough?,"I get a maximum of 90 minutes off my new battery. It works and, as long as I am near an outlet, I can perform some tasks during the middle of a flight. If this is your only battery then you will need plenty of writing pads. Draft your correspondence and then type fast once you turn on the computer."
4,my thoughts of the game,i think it is a must game to play if you like to see thing blow up and different body parts flying off. I most like when duke says words every time a alien gets blown up by a rocket or pipe bomb and you see the strippers. A must game to recommend.
3,why so bad you ask?,"this game has no soul. you just shoot aliens. like DOOM. The guns are pretty good and so is the AI. After playing quake 3 and unreal tournament, I coulnd't but help laugh at the graphics. Instead of the game i would suggest half life."
1,Beware of Description,"Buyers beware when buying this game. The product specs claim that it is for Windows, and Linux and Mac, but in reality it is not. The game itself does not work on a windows system, and the product specs on the box clearly say that it will not work on windows being that it is a DOS game.Needless to say I am out shipping costs because people falsely advertise this product.Just a side note, I have played the game and I am able to set it up on windows 7 though with a ton of trouble. If you are interested in getting this game you should research how to set it up on a windows machine through the many blogs out there. The game is awesome to play and is tons of fun. The sarcasm, raunchyness, shooting and general mayham is beyond great!To install on windows check out these sites[...][...]"
5,The best of its kind,"Duke Nukem gives gamers a bit of every thing. First it gives you action, which I like. Then it gives you humor, and many more things. The weapons are too cool, plus every now and then you'll get a funny Duke saying like ""bitchin'"". This game is a must have, and if you don't want to own it, at least download the demo. This game is totally awsome."
5,A Lifesaver!!!,"For anyone suffering with emotional pain and trauma , i tell you that you must read this book. Dr. Maccaro explains the dynamics of stress, anxiety and stress related illness so well because she herself walked through it. In this book she bares her heart and soul, as she lays out a protocol of amino acids, identifying the root cause of emotional pain and how to rebuild your stress weary body. There is a ton of applicable information. Her style of writing is suberb with continued emphasis on the importance of prayer in recovery. After applying her knowledge to my own struggle with anxiety and unrelenting stress, my life is worth living again!It is a Godsend."
3,I dunno...,"I didn't like this movie too much. It's obviously a fairly good sci-fi anime, but I didn't feel it was TOO much to hoot and holler about. With so many great movies out there, I'm afraid Maps just doesn't compete. I figure that a lot of people would find this movie entertaining, so it's probably worth your time, but as for my opinion, all I can say is this: I wouldn't want to watch this again, and if you're already hooked on something else, this will probably seem insulting to you. And parents, don't be fooled by the PG rating. They messed up. This movie is in NO WAY PG. I had to turn it off in the middle because my little brother was freaking out."
3,A Note on Print Quality,"I selected this text for a course I'm currently teaching in advanced multivariable calculus after examining a colleague's copy, which was printed back in 1977 when the second edition was published. When my desk copy arrived in the mail and the students' copies arrived in the campus bookstore, I learned that the quality of the recent printing of this book is very poor. The typesetting looks like an nth-generation photocopy of a printout from a defective, low-resolution inkjet printer. It's hard enough for math students to sit down and read their textbooks without making it harder for them by giving them a poorly printed book to read. This may be a deal-breaker as far as me selecting this text again in the future."
1,fairy solar light,This product was defective when I received it and would not light up. I sent it back. I think it was a really cute solar light and would have kept it had it not been defective.
1,expensively bad service,I bought 11 DVDs on ebay at the same time as I bought these. They only cost $20 for 11 and arrived before Xmas. These took 7 seven weeks longer to arrive and each DVD cost $20.- so expensive for such bad service. I will never shop amazon again
1,very upset!,I was looking forward to watching officer and a gentleman and not only was my package late but its the wrong movie. they gave me a triple feature with different movie titles and i dont even know how i would even get this fixed because the company had no number on the invoice. i would of given this a five star if i at least got the right movie!
4,Air race,This game is outstanding. If U are into flight simulators and just want to flight for the out and out fun and speed of it this is the game U want.
4,Great Sailing history book on the Clipper ship era,"Like the other reviewer, I found this book in a second hand bookstore and bought it on a whim. It turned out to be a great read. I'd always known that Clipper ships were the fastest sailing merchants, but I had no idea how hard they were to sail fast. Whipple goes into a lot of the history surrounding these boats, the gold rush, the tea trade, the Paris fashion trade with China. All fascinating stuff and well told. Not a page burner but a good book that I enjoyed reading."
2,"Decals came off during the first rain shower,","It was my Christmas present. I'm really into black and white cows. But the decals on the legs came off the first time water, in the form of rain, hit it. A legless cow just doesn't do it for me."
4,Riveting,"This set covers serpent worship, Viking history, & the Cross of Thoth--all three subjects of great interest to me. I think it's obvious why snakes are such a huge part of our religions & culture, as they have been our natural enemies since we began. What is interesting though is that serpents have been singled out so, as we have many other animal enemies...anyway, this DVD was pretty much what I was looking for."
5,A truly lovely book,"It's called ""Living with Quilts"" but the real question is how did we ever live without them? This fascinating book caters for the real hardcore quilters like myself, yet is accessible too to those uninitiated in this fascinating craft. An ideal coffee table book for those expecting middle aged women or gay visitors."
5,Invaluable Guide,"As a speech coach, I am often asked to suggest books on public speaking. I am happy that Ed Barks has written such a terrific book which I can now strongly recommend to any business communicator. Mr. Barks tells us everything we need to know to make compelling, persuasive presentations."
2,Rob Thomas something to be tour live at red rocks bluray,"Distressed!1 Disappointed?!! I did not know that BluRay discs had various world codes and that America & Australia consequently were not in the same code region..... so I'm a sad sack because I can't even play it on my Aussie devices...............but had opened the box, so probably can't return it, and am desperate to have it, so have sent for a DVD now. More cost. ARRGH!!"
1,Malo y aburido,"Serrat nuevamente nos trata de dar una leccion sobre la pobreza, el socialismo, y la amistad, con su rica y confusa prosa de la cual solo saque que si me interesa la poesia, compraria el libro, no el disco. Las melodias son aburridas, los temas de as canciones, un bodrio, y el disco se mueve al paso de caracol artritico. Este disco y ""En Transito"" (1981) son dos porquerias sin inspiracion pero grabadas y producidas a toda prisa probablemente porque tenia que cumpir un contrato con la disquera. Escuchen las muestras y eviten comprarlo. Yo lo compre cuando recien salio, hasta tenia un autografo. No aguante el disco. Lo vendi en eBay por $5-."
5,Awesome!,"This CD is amazing. Susan Ashton has such a beautiful voice that you don't focus on it, you focus on God and what He is trying to teach you through the song. Like another reviewer said, I love EVERY song on the CD and listen to it all the time!"
1,not as good as I thought it would be,The graphics are not very realistic. You have only 3 weapons to choose from and no choice of which ammo to use. Only 3 places to hunt and you can't walk while hunting.
2,A Good Days Hunting,"Not the best game that I have ever played, but still enjoyable. The game as a whole is not very realistic although I find that once I start playing I play for ages. I have not played the newer versions, but I am sure they are a better buy."
4,Gloria,"Buen trabajo, con buenos duos, pero nada particularmente extraordinario. La ventaja? Vienen DVD y CD juntos. Destacables lso duos con Sin bandera y Guzman."
5,Excellent quality!!!!,"Excellent concert, the quality of the shipment was awesome, neatly packed and on-time. We have enjoy it every single time. Thank you."
1,outdoor items,Worked for a week called Eco they sent new battery and it still doesn't work. Have to send it back now plus pay shipping back.
2,light not last,"it is gorgeous, but after one season I cannot get the light to power or light at all..."
3,Not so great,"I bought this solar garden fairy for my grand-daughter who is nine, and has her own little garden. The fairy is disappointing in a couple of ways, first the solar light is very dim, even with a complete day of sun to charge it, and second, the switch to turn on the light is confusing as it is so soft to the touch it's impossible to know whether it has actually been turned on or not."
2,Very pretty and petite,But it only worked once. I gave it as a gift to to my Mother for her wonderful Garden. Very disappointed that it has not worked since.
2,Echo Sleeping Fairy,"These Fairies are lovely in appearance, but Echo makes an inferior product. I have purchased 14 so far as I use them to light up a Chartres labyrinth that I made and five of the 14 do not work. Two were broken when I got them--one of these was my recent purchases from Amazon.I had an electrician friend look at one that stopped working shortly after I had it and he was not impressed with the workmanship on these. He was not able to repair it. I tried contacting Echo with limited success--their comment was that I didn't purchase the lights from them so I needed to go back to the source, but they took no ownership for problems.Of the 5 I purchased from Amazon, 1 was broken and two others had globes that were loose--one it looked like the glue had not worked and the other one had no glue on it at all.If I didn't like the looks of these on my labyrinth I would be looking for alternatives as I have not been impressed with the workmanship on the solar part of them."
1,shipping,I ordered this item and i took awhile for me to get it. Even then i didn't receive it. i had to call and see what was taking so long and they told me it wouldn't be in stock till the end of the next month! it still said in stock on their site! unacceptable.
1,Pretty but non-functioal,Received as gift because I collect solar garden items. This never worked nor was I able to repair it. (Vendor also never responded to email.)
5,I enjoy this purchase!,This lovely fairy completed my flower garden! She's cute whether it is day or night! Sunlight charges the solar panel in the back (can't put her in a corner) and the globe will glow for about 4 hours starting at dusk. I am pleased with this purchase and the price!
5,Not the average biography,"Tolstoy is one the greatest writers during what must be considered the heroic age of novel writing. He never makes a wrong move in his writing, but probably was one of the most unpleasant people ever to live. Wilson here gives us a view of both the sublime artist and the opinionated gad fly of his friends, family and country and presents a fairly complete picture of a divided man. This is a tell all book, but not in the usual sense. Wilson focuses on the inner life of Tolstoy rather than his day to day experiences which probably were not as meaningful to him as what went on inside. This probably is the best biogrpahy of Tolstoy in English. It is good for those who are familiar with Tolstoy's works and for those who are not."
5,"A wonderful, rereadable biography.","Trapped and ill in Japan for two weeks, I only had ten books with me to keep me sane. Fortunately, this was one of them. The best biography I've ever read, giving a wonderful portrayal Tolstoy's personality, and shedding new light on his works. Wilson is never less than brilliant, no matter whether he's discussing Tolstoy's fondness for women or his mildly dotty religious writings. I particularly love his commentary on the dilemma of being a Russian; that you know it's the greatest country in the world, but you also know it's hell to live there! It lasted eight readings in Japan, and I've read it twice since then."
4,Fascinating!,"Have been researching Molokans in Russia. The fascinating story of this eccentric and talented man included many tidbits applicable to our family history in Samara as well as recounting his personal story. Well written, enjoyable reading as well as informative."
2,SCRATCH THIS ONE,"SCRATCH is sort of a sequel to an earlier movie called KILLER RATS. Both are German made films and horribly dubbed. Aside from that, the scenarios are basically similar, too. In this one, mutant rats escape from a laboratory and wreak havoc in a little German village. Frank, our hero from the first film and his motley crew do battle. There are lots of scenes of scurrying rats but the plot is almost incoherent, the acting wooden, and the suspense minimal. For die hard rat lovers only."
5,Don's Review,"ScratchTHE DVD PLAYS JUST FINE AND I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH AT ALL. THANK YOU,D.R.B.DONALD BUTLERLOS ANGELES, CA"
1,low priced for a reason,I bought 4 of these clamp lights and every one of them arrived bent up 2 of them so bad that they look used. packing was poor and the thing bends almost as easy as foil. ouch!
3,Lamp that almost clamps,"The lamp itself is fine, but the clamp is a little weak and wants to slip off of whatever it is clamped to."
4,I could have owned this game!,"I never got to own this game, only play it at a friends house. It's a really addicting, though difficult game about marbles. It was created by Milton Bradley (no, not the arrogant guy who plays for that Oakland team).You, as a marble, go through 6 mazes. That's the point of the game. At the end of the game you find out how good you did by way of a scorecard. Simple, fun marble madness."
1,The Worst Game I've Ever Played in My Life.,"MARBLE MADNESS IS THE WORST GAME EVER IN NINTENDO HISTORY. THIS GAME IS SO STUPID BEYOND BELIEF. THE CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE! WHERE IS THE FRIGGING MAGIC WAND??? THERE IS NO INFORMATION HOW IT APPEARS. IT JUST DOES APPEAR SO RANDOMLY! WHY THE HECK DOES A MARBLE BREAK LIKE A FRAGILE GLASS? IN REALITY, MARBLES ARE TOUGH AS NAILS. I WAS ABLE TO BEAT THE GAME, BUT WAS IT WORTH IT? NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! I AM NEVER PLAYING THIS IDIOTIC GAME AGAIN THE REST OF MY LIFE. BAD BAD BAD GAME! THIS GAME MAKES ME SO MAD! BURN IT! THROW IT IN A FIRE! BLOW IT UP! DESTROY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!"
5,Good beginner book but....,I love this book. I'm just starting to learn mandolin and it has great exercises to practice from. However I have been reading music since I was 5. If this is your first attempt at reading music/tabs or your first stringed instrument I think the book may be hard to understand at first. That being said I would still definitely recommend you pick up this book along with another to start out on. I mean come on for this price why not right?! (:
4,Helpful guide to learning mandolin,"I bought this book at a friend's suggestion. She plays several bluegrass instruments and said the video was all she needed to learn mandolin. She took no outside lessons but had been playing guitar and some other instruments prior to picking up the mandolin. The book is helpful to accompany the video so that you can follow along and not have to pause every few seconds. Also, it is useful to have for practicing when you don't really need to see the video but need to see the music. Be aware that this book comes with a MUSIC CD not the DVD. The DVD is sold separately! I recommend the book. It is working well for me for practicing and I am slowly improving!"
2,One of the Lesser Entries in the Series,"I enjoy Robert B. Parker's work, but many of his later novels have a by-the-numbers quality that make them pleasant diversions and nothing more. PLAYMATES is pretty much a perfect example; there is nothing in this book that I haven't seen in other, superior novels by Parker.Unlike most of the other Spenser books, however, there are no real sympathetic characters in this book. The basketball player is arrogant and annoying, and is not worth the effort that Spenser invests in trying to save him. In many ways, he reminds me of April Kyle in TAMING A SEA HORSE and MILLION DOLLAR BABY -- a character with almost no redeeming features who Spenser forms some inexplicable attachment to.The plot of PLAYMATES is thin and there's very little true mystery or suspense. My advice is to skip this book and try other Spenser novels, such as EARLY AUTUMN, MORTAL STAKES, or LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE."
3,disappointing,"I've read all the Spenser books up to Playmates and have to say this one is disappointing. The characterizations of Duane and Chantel are well done, but the story truly strains the limits of credibility. And Parker seems to be stagnating with Spenser and crew -- there is little if anything here fresh or interesting, especially since an earlier book in the series already deals with gambling's influence on sports. Crimson Joy, the last book in the series before this one, was much better."
4,Spenser 4 Hire,"This is the first Spenser novel I have read, and I think I am off to a good start. I never really watched the tv show and I don't know if it was indicative of the books. I am a big fan of both Harlan Coben and Robert Crais and I feel that their characters and sidekicks are very similar to Spenser and Hawk. Obviously Parker's novels precede those two authors, so I have to say he originated a good trend of the witty private detective and his cool but dangerous partner. I am also a big sports fan, so this book was all the more appealing. It's a quick read, so pick it up."
1,An effort to finish,"I haven't read a book in a long time that I just wanted to give up on. I felt like it had a huge political agenda, which was very confusing to me and not of much interest. The names were very difficult to keep up with as well as the history. I finally finished it out of sheer determination. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you are from Egypt, then you might grasp it's meaning."
4,Good love story with authentic politics,"A previous reviewer called this book propaganda, saying that all the points of view are not presented on the history of Egypt. I felt that that was exactly the point - the Egyptian characters have Egyptian opinions, and their conversations and debates are written much as they would have occurred. It's not meant to be a history book; it's a historical novel which, in addition to a compelling (but somewhat standard) set of love stories, also gives an illuminating look into the Egyptian perspective on their own culture and history. I found it a fascinating chance to explore an Egyptian point of view, presented truthfully from characters whose motivations I could understand."
4,Love and politics,"I wouldn't say this book is for everyone but I loved it. It flows between characters, times and languages. There are really 2 stories here, both equally interesting and magical. The summary on the back of the book focuses mostly on the American woman, Isabel, and her discovery of the journals of her English great-grandmother, Anna. However, the story, was more about the Egyptian characters and Anna. Isabel is almost a minor character. The modern Amal becomes nearly obsessed with her grandmother, Layla, and great-aunt, Anna, through the journals. The story involves quite a bit of politics of the region as well. The love stories and stories of sisterhood are illustrated wonderfully on this political and cultural backdrop."
5,Love a Love Story,I love a love story that defies the time period; yet weaves generations during several time periods. I tell people about this sweet book all the time--it's so refreshing. It does not focus on a deep psychological sickness. It is beautifully written and a joy to read.
2,Dull love story,"Dull, dull, dull... The author tries too hard but the characters are simply too perfect to be interesting. Anna and her saintly devotion to her husband did not appeal to me at all. The present day story is more engaging but the politics and the heavy use of Arabic make it difficult to follow. A slow, difficult read which I wouldn't recommend."
5,Fabulous,"I notice a previous reviewer has dismissed this book as anti-western propoganda. What nonsense! This book held me spellbound, taught me things, and made me want to find out more. If you're offended by Moslems being presented as rational human beings, then perhaps this book is not for you. But if you love a well-written, multi-layered story which enlightens and entertains, AND is a decent size, so you can really immerse yourself, it would be difficult to find a better book than this."
2,Skip this book,"I had a hard time staying interested in this book. Was slightly compelling initially, then really dragged in the end. I worked hard to try to finish it, and was tempted to just stop reading in the middle (which I rarely do) and was then disappointed in the ending.I'd recommend skipping this book entirely."
1,Highly Disappointing,"I was eager to read this book after reading the reviews, and knowing it was a Booker finalist. I found it so disappointing that I gave up about a third of the way through it. I found the plots implausible, the characters 2 dimensional, and the poetic descriptions of Egypt beautiful but pretentious. I also agree with other reviewers that the use of Arabic was distracting, and came across as the author trying to prove her superiority to the reader."
2,"A fantastic idea, poorly executed","What a great idea for a novel - take two interesting, connected periods of tumult in Egyptian history, and compare them using a sweeping family saga of journals and personal relationships. Sounds interesting, right? The whole thing comes across as an unwieldly mess, unfortunately. I found myself trying really hard not to skip the ""modern"" passages, as they are the least interesting - and I am one who always reads cover to cover. The journals are probably the best (italics), as they are more focused and limited in scope. There are better books out there."
1,couldn't get through it,"What a confusing style. It's impossible to follow the switches between the diary and the person reading it to know who is ""speaking"" and when...to even begin to understand what the story is all about. I was supposed to read this for my book club and couldn't finish it."
2,Plodding and prejudicial,"I have been forcing my way through this book for my book group. While it has enjoyable moments, I am finding it heavy-handed and plodding. Worse than that, however, was discovering the anti-Jew, anti-Israel position espoused by the author, perpetuated through the voice of one of the protagonists, Amal. I found the stereotypes and lies most offensive. Had I known this before reading it, I never would have paid for the book and put money in this author's pocket."
2,J.P. Balogh,"Less would have been more. I am one of those readers, who does not believe that the more complex the story, the more worth it is. The idea for this novel is excellent and it could have been a remarkable book, but it is not. The intent of the author is obvious (too obvious), but not quite convincing. Anna's diary, quaint and very much late 19th century, saves the novel from becoming a tedious harangue. My initial interest flagged after a while, and I found myself skipping pages until I came to a secion in italics."
1,typos/errors galore!,"I enjoyed this novel, but it was VERY difficult to read on Kindle. The family tree diagram in the paper version was not in Kindle version plus there were all kinds of typos and errors in the electronic version. It was distracting and made it a more difficult read. Using the Glossary at the end of the book was also awkward. Very disappointed..."
4,"From the ""Golden Era"" of Science Fiction","While the prose is occasionally clunky, and the science outrageous, this is a 50s example of a successful SF series. It is still a fun read."
4,Chronicles of Lensmen v.1,"The book arrived within the time period stated when purchased and was in excellent condition.This was a gift for a family member who read this series as a youngster. Sadly his health has not been good the past while so some time passed before he had a look at it. He really enjoyed it, reading half the book when he first sat down with it. I'm so glad this series is available again. Thank you."
5,"*twitch, twitch* must get...",first of all i loved the first and i'm a gcn fanboy who is obsessed with great rpgs and action games so i had gotten a surprisingly large collection of rpgs but NO DECENT ACTION TITLES! then i saw the first in a magazine so i searched for some info on it and got it cheap at target ( $10.00s off ^ ^) and i loved it it was the best and next to all my zeldacube games and metroid prime this was one of my favorites then after i got obsessed with highscores and everything it became my second favorite (sc2 wuz betta)and now the sequall is here i'm so excited!
2,"Play the first one, not the second.","The first game was entirely new and fresh. This one on the other hand, is nowhere near new and fresh. The only thing that could've saved it was multiplayer, and hey, lucky us, there is no multiplayer.ONE STAR. BIG WASTE O' TIME. That's what I'd like to rate this, and probably should rate this, but there were a couple decent boss fights and power-ups that prevented me from totally hating it, but still doesn't stop me from disliking it.Get the first one for a good time, but skip the second one, because really you've already played that one when you played the first one."
5,Si te gusta la muscia con sentimiento....este es para ti!!!,"Yolanda del Rio canta con mucho sentimiento y este CD tiene puras canciones buenas, si teines ganas de llorar de sentimiento, este es el bueno."
4,Good story with a good message.,"This book was apparently written at a time in America's history where war, prejudice and morals were at heightened sensitivity. Today's young adults may not fully understand some of the military flashback episodes, or why the young boy who came home with their father was difficult for many people to accept. But what shines through the rest of the nuances being introduced, is having the good morals to do the right thing, not judging someone based upon their looks or origin, and learning what it means to be a good friend. Beautiful imagery about the horse and his personality."
1,it stunk,This book is a bore!If the author wants to write a book then she should at least write a decent one.
1,Horrible Movie,"0 stars! I just watched this movie and it was one of the kind that you really want to just stop watching, but since you paid money to rent it, keep watching, thinking it might get better. I wish I would've taken it out because the acting was terrible and the movie was one of the worst I've ever seen."
1,Cary Elwes stars in this annoyingly bad movie which seems like a comedy more then a thriller,"Someone out there is killing girls and videotaping them. Jesse, played by Rachael Leigh Cook (Tangled, She's All That); Jane, played by Annabella Sciorra (Underworld (1996), Law & Order: Criminal Intent) and Rob, played by Kip Pardue (The Devil's Pond, Rules of Attraction) all get involved with a show called American Crime hosted by Albert, played by a very annoying, lame and disappointing Cary Elwes (Saw, The Princess Bride). The cast is extremely wasted, why would Kip, Annabella, Cary and Rachael sign up for this huh? Where they dragged into it? Anyway, by the end I was ready to skeet shoot this DVD out the window. Badly directed and the actors dont even look like their giving a damn.Also starring Wade Williams (Candyman: Day of the Dead, ALI), Julie Cialini (Playboy Playmate I read) and Michael O'Neill )Dreamcatcher, Seabiscuit). Pass this trecherous toxic waste. Plays out more like a comedy."
2,It's a crime alright,"This movie was so terribly boring. What you have is a bunch of reporters, one constantly filming and talking and this long confusing story about how a stalker is after them one by one. I was amazed at how wonderful Anabella Schiorra looks though. She was the mom from Hand that Rocks the Cradle and she looks younger now than she did then!! Anyway this movie had a great cast, but god only knows why they chose to star in this boring mess."
1,Another Boring Dud,"It Starts like a campy horror flick...should have stayed that way......The acting by all was average at best,except the the high camp of Cary Elwes which was awful....Almost zero suspense..Anyone could figure that this turkey was going nowhere.The very end where a new video was dropped through a door slot was the typical surprise ending repeated over and over in a thousand cheesy horror flicks...Poor and boring trash."
1,utter nonsense,American Crime is neither thrilling nor humorous-boring and inane are the only adjectives that come to mind to describe it. The plot is about a serial killer who videotapes his victims before killing them. Who is doing the killing and why?-don't ask because these questions are never considered or answered in the movie. This is a low-budget movie with a weak script and bad acting-don't waste your time on it.
2,THE CRIME IS THE MOVIE,"What a shame..with an intriguing premise and some weird acting and photography, AMERICAN CRIME could have been a neat little thriller. Alas, by the time the scriptwriters get done with its incohesive plot twists and lack of a good ending, the movie has sunk to the rest of the doomed to the bargain bin collections. Suffice to say, you can hardly recognize Cary Elwes in his make up in the role of Albert Bodine, host of ""American Crime."" Rachael Leigh Cook, Kip Pardue and Annabella Sciorra all deserve better roles than the writers end up giving them. The movie starts off like its one of those true crime series but midways into the movie, we find out...well, I won't spoil it, but it makes little if any sense. Rent if desperate, but you can do better."
3,Go Bananas is Okay,"So far, I have purchased three Gamewright games for my almost five year old son. They are all good, but Go Bananas is our least favorite. Rat a Tat Cat is by far the most fun and original. He also enjoys Wig Out. The Gamewright games are neat and unique...the artwork is especially cool. I will continue to purchase more of the Gamewright games."
2,Least favorite...,"We own about 10 Gamewright card games, and this is our least favorite. It's just a slapping game, no strategy. Boring and slow! We played it once and it has sat in the closet ever since. Rat a Tat Cat and Sleeping Queens are much better."
1,Well....,Son de carton!!! y no tienen sonido como una corneta...que yo sepa los blowout suenan al soplarlos!!!...bueno...estos no...lo pensaria dos veces para comprarlo de nuevo...
3,Not a heavy duty pump!,Not recommened for heavy duty garage work.....But if ur looking for a tire pump for ur bicycle tires....the price is right!
1,Absolute waste of money!,I got this for my bike and I sure wish I didn't. This is more appropriate for balls or something. I could not get my tires pumped up all the way and on the 2nd use it broke!
5,Good Pump for the Price,"This is a good floor pump. Perfect for bicycles. Steel construction and sturdy. Fold-able, metal feet for anchoring. Note: 90psi max, which was fine for my 65psi max. tires. Also, light enough to carry if you just HAD to transport it while riding your bike. This pump has a schrader valve only. No presta attachment."
4,Very impressive,"I started getting into 50's Latin music about a year ago, and this cd made it's way to me. It's at times soothing and at times infectiously energetic. I dance to this cd while cooking or getting dressed - it's one of those cd's you dance to no matter what you're doing. Great big band, hip-shakin' stuff."
5,The Best of Tito Puente Vol 1,"To the writer Karen Tito Puente is not Cuban, he is Puerto Rican. This CD is the best. Never judge a CD by its cover."
4,Book has great ideas on parenting difficult children,I read 1 2 3 magic. I enjoyed that book and the ideas the author had. I was anxious to read another book from this author. This book had alternatives to counting. I found this book helpful.
1,Buyer BEWARE - this episode included on Season One Box Set,"Maybe I am an idiot, but I think Amazon should state clearly that the single episode on this DVD is included in the Season One box set. I had already purchased Season One and then I purchased this, opened it and now it is not returnable. My one star rating is directed not at 'Monk' but at Amazon."
4,Crimefighter with a difference,"It's high time Tony Shaloub made it big. His role as unhinged-movie-producer-from-hell in the Coen brothers' movie Barton Fink was exhilarating. As was his performance as superlawyer in The Man Who Wasn't There (the Coens certainly know talent when they see it).The only negative thing that can be said about Monk is that it's long overdue. The writing's good. It's very good actually. But some episodes are better than others. In Monk Meets Dale the Whale, for example, the dialogue is badly dubbed and the continuity is choppy and hiccupy. The storylines are mostly standard TV show plots, some even seem recycled from old episodes of Streets of San Francisco or Scooby Doo. So you shouldn't watch Monk for the ingenious plots - it's Monk's phobia-intensive behaviour and case-solving talent that we're after. Well, that and Sharona's great legs. And the theme tune is great. I sure hope those two get it together at the end; Sharona has appalling taste in men."
1,Amazon- watch out for your customers!,"I like Amazon and I love Monk, but they are not watching out for their customers by recommending a title that is included on season 1. Do they read their customer reviews? The good ones only come from the fact that the episode is awesome, but why buy one episode for little less than the cost of the whole season. Get it together Amazon!"
5,Well blended cast and great script,"I was really impressed with this Premiere Episode of ""Monk"". Of course, the lead character is played so well by Tony Shalhoub, but it takes more than that to make a premiere interesting enough to run as a TV series for another two seasons. The three main supporting characters are wonderfully written in the script and played to perfection by the actors. Every time I watch this premiere, I think I have a different favorite supporting character. I can't wait for the DVD to be released with the season episodes from season one and two. I think I like it so much because it's very different from all the rest of what's on TV these days."
4,Monk - the complete first season,"Today, 19th January, 2004, and I see an ad in Vanity fair that announces ""Monk - the complete first season now available on DVD"". But not at Amazon.com. The computer simply rejects the request with alternative offerings, like ""Friends - the complete first season"". Not even an opportunity to place a forward order..."
1,Needless Anxiety,"Do not waste your money on this book!!! When I first started reading it, I FREAKED OUT!!! The material it covers (and not well enough if you do not already know it) is WAY more advanced then the questions on the test. My money was better spent taking the practice test on line and focusing on the areas I needed to review (like basic geometry, basic biology, etc.)"
2,Over the top waste of time,"This Multisubject CST was much more simpler than this book would have you believe. For example, one question in this book asks about tRNA, mRNA, nucleotides etc. I haven't thought about tRNA since highschool AP Bio. Yet this book had me believing that the Multi-subject CST would have all these difficult questions in it. Like a previous reviewer said, most of the questions on the real test are common sense. I definitely feel like I wasted precious money and time on this book."
4,Good book overall,"I really liked this book.The only reason I am giving it only 4 stars is because I could have really done without Lewis and Cecil's chapters. The women's chapters were so interesting, dramatic and suspenseful that turning the page only to read about Lewis or Cecil was totally anti-climactic for me. If Lewis and Cecil were only mentioned in passing during the characters' chapters, that would have been okay but alone, Lewis and Cecil were rather boring and I had to fight the urge to completely skip their chapters."
3,Just A little Short,"I've read all of Terri McMillan's books. While I have to admit I like her writing style, I'm not really in love with the book. The situations these characters were really complex and I thought she could have delved a little bit deeper into them. Child molestation, drug abuse, low self esteem. Whats up with the cookie cutter ending? I wasn't buying it. She's written better. Buy either ""Mama"" or ""Waiting to Exhale"" they are much better reads."
5,WOW!,"Great, Great book! The characters were so real. You feel like you know them. I appreciate the family tree, I referred to it often. You will laugh and cry!"
2,Not worth your time....,"I've never read a Terry McMillan book before because I just watched the movies and was never really interested in reading her books. Reading this one certainly didn't make me want to read another. The only reason I read it is because it was one of my book club selections.This book is very dry, it's toooo detailed and very depressing. It's basically about a mother, her selfish kids and their issues. The first few chapters of this book is the most depressing part because the mother goes on and on and on with unnecessary detail about how her kids and husband have hurt her, themselves or other people. Almost every character in this book, right down to the grandkids has issues. There's humor in this book, also tragedy but it wasn't enough to make up for the poor writing. Also, this was not proofread well because there are an abundance of type errors in it.This was not a good read at all."
5,heart warming,"This book started off good, and it kept going after that, this book was about family and sticking together."
4,Overall I liked it,I really liked how you would see all the activities going on from each different characters point of view. I felt there could have been more resolution on some of the main characters. Some of them and their problems were not fully resolved. You go away feeling everything will be ok but I wanted the author to be more specific. Still would recommend it and still love Ms. McMillan
2,WEAK!!!,"This is one of McMillan's weakest books. It literally took me forever to get through it. I read the first 10 pages of this book, then set it down on my bookshelf. That was 3 years ago. I decided to finally finish reading the book this summer (2004). I haven't had to force myself to read a book like that in such a long time. She uses a lot of characters in this novel, so much so that she created a family tree in the inside cover just to keep the readers (and herself) from getting so confused. The story line itself is not as rich as her other plots. I'm a big fan of McMillan and have read all of her novels. However, this book just does not do her writing or story-telling skills any justice. She should have written a caveat emptor in her prologue that read ""Buyer beware. You'll be disappointed right down to the very last sentence of this novel."" I hope McMillan redeems authorship in more current novels."
5,Terry child you need to just sit down with a fan in yo hand.,This was so good. I love every thing you write and this is no exception. Keep on keeping on.
2,What the .......!,This book seemed like the watered down version of Momma. The reason I didn't give it a zero was because it had a few good parts.
2,Couldn't get into it.,"I have some of Terry McMillian's novels and they were really good, but this one, I just couldn't seem to get past chapter 2. I tried and tried, but if I can't get past chapter 2 then I don't see the rest of the book being that great."
2,Too much,"After reading A Day Late and a Dollar Short, i was disappointed after reading all 400 something pages. Depressing is the first word that comes to mind, because the book saddened me. The characters were angry, hurt, jealous, insulting and disrepectful to each other. No one was happy nor as family members did they like each other. This was a bit much to bear with 6 characters from the same family, from the mother to the youngest adult child. There was some of the usual McMillan humor when it comes to talking about people, and being descriptive these parts were very funny. The most light-hearted part of the story. I have been a fan of Terry McMillan since her first book, waitng all this time for the new book was disappointing. I hope her next book will deliver another message other than people are miserable and enjoying it, not real, not cool."
4,Don't Put Off Til Tomorrow What You Can Do Today...,"Terry McMillan has continued in her down-to-earth style to which every African-American family can relate. She incorporates themes of the good, the bad, and the stressful. And, of course, she continues to explore the close, and often painful, relationships between mothers and daughters. She also issues a reminder that we should live for today. Enjoy life and take pleasure in our familial ties while our loved ones are still with us. To say we're sorry when we're wrong and to forgive each other rather than bear long, hurtful grudges. All in all, it was a fast read. Always interesting. Great book, if you like her other novels."
5,Family,I loved this book because it reminded me of my family. Almost ever character reminded me of somebody in my family. I loved the book. It was like a real African American Family. She kept it real. And I loved the grandma.
4,For Anyone Who Has a Brother or Sister...,"""A Day Late and a Dollar Short"" does start off a bit slow -- you have to take the time to get into the heads of six different family members, each one writing a chapter in his or her own voice. But once most of them gather together in Vegas to aid their mother Viola, recovering from a severe asthma attack, all heck breaks loose and the book takes off... the characters come alive off the page very well, and you WILL care about them. The ending of this one seems a bit better than ""Stella"" or ""Exhale"" -- in those books, it seemed like McMillan just stopped writing, whereas with this book, you get much more of a sense of ""completeness"". Have a small box of tissues handy for this really terrific read..."
5,Love it,"Great book, enjoy reading it every time. Why do these reviews have to be so long? I think ""great book"" says it all"
5,Meeting my goals,I wanted a good copy of 'A Day Late and a Dollar Short' to give as a present and this one met my expectations. Thanks
5,Absolutely Engrossing,"This book was enthralling. I found that I could relate to it. Personally, felt that I knew everyone in the book as they seemed like members of my own family.The language and dialogue in the book were also realistic, making it even easier to understand and love."
4,Lost Love,I read this book in high school and spent years trying to remember what it was called. Trust me when I say that this book was worth all the time I spent rattling my brain.
5,Family First,"This book is great. The mother begins telling the story. She then describes her (family) husband, children, and grandchildren in a way that only a mother, wife, and grandmother can. It was downright hilarious. To my surprise,however, the husband and children tell their opinions on the family and themselves. When you see how the family sees a person as opposed to how the person sees themselves you begin to think about some of the attitudes you have towards members of your own family. The beginning of the book will have you cracking up and by the end you will be in tears. My boyfriend had to read the last chapter to me because I was crying too hard to complete it."
5,Truly Awesome,"I may be partly biased when it comes to this book seeing that I am truly a fan of Terry McMillian. But I must admit this book is truly awesome! Terry has not lost her touch at all! She continues to make you feel like you have known these characters all of your life, and that you are somehow connected to them by blood. I am not a very emotional person but I knew this book was a winner when I found myself crying at one part. It is a must read for all families that are not so ""normal"" (are any of us?). Dont miss out on this great read and come up ""A day late and A Dollar Short""."
3,okay but old story,"This book was enjoyable enough, but it's basically a retelling of the movie Soul Food. Siblings have problems, the matriarch dies, and then they all get their lives back on track and become a family again. *yawn*But the book is funny in parts and Viola is a great character. All of the characters are well-written and their individual stories are very familiar in today's world. The chapters are hard to get into sometimes because the point of view changes each time and each person telling it is different. I would have liked their names in the chapter titles to make the transitions easier.Good enough book but it's been done before."
3,Good Book!,"I liked this book, it's the first I've read by Terry McMillan. The characters were well developed, but at times I had trouble figuring out which character each chapter was covering.One question, Janelle was pregnant with George's baby, but McMillan never tells us if she gives birth or not at the end of the book. Very strange!"
2,Terry What Happened,"I didn't actually buy this book, my sister loaned me her copy. I don't often question my sister's sanity but this is one of those times I considered having the girl drug tested. This book is not Terry McMillan. I think an alien life form invaded her body and wrote this for her. It was awful. The first chapter is as far as I got. The mother in this story spent far too much time bitching about her useless children. After reading complaint after complaint I was ready to kill the mother ,the kids ,Terry ,and my sister. Terry can write better than this. I have her other books and was deeply disappointed by this one. Terry that young man must be wearing you out because you failed with this book. Don't buy it, it's not worth the money or time. Buy her other books you'll enjoy them more."
1,Ridiculous!,This book is basically the plots of every Oprah Bookclub Book ever written and shoved into one book. I was glad when it was over!
3,Terry McMillan is a male basher.,"If you read all of her books, the males, no matter how young or old are always dysfunctional in some sort of way. This book is no different. Just about every male in this book has some kind of deep dark problem. The one male that she reflects in somewhat of a positive light is Dingus. But even he has a little issue. I always thought that she was overrated and this book is a huge bore. Its showing nothing out of the ordinary at all. Its like reading a diary that is not good. I mean, after I read the book I found myself saying, ""who cares?"""
1,A Day late and dollar short,"I was disappointed in this latest edition of Terry McMillian. It was slow, boring and predictable. Terry has lost the magic of her earlier works...Mama, Disappearing Acts and Waithing to exhale. In my opinion, her sister Roslyn is a better writer."
3,A Day Late and A Dollar Short,"Well written, grasps the reader and holds the interest. You find yourself wanting to read it through at the first sitting. As much as I like McMillian this was not her best. Wish I had waited until it came out in paperback. Hope it comes out in a movie."
4,You Got to Read This Book,It was a great book. I loved every page of it. It portrays the family dynamics to which many of us can relate.
4,Lots of Fun,"A Day Late and a Dollar Short is a very fun read. It's the story of an American family, three sisters, one brother and their separated parents. Each family member tells his or her story from his or her opinionated point of view. Each story is both funny and sad and every one is well told. The narrative starts with Viola, the family matriarch, who is recovering from a severe asthma attack and is in the hospital. She goes on about all of her family members, including her estranged husband, alternatively picking out their faults and praising them. One by one, each of them chimes in with their own story, but we eventually learn that Viola pretty much had them all pegged in the opening chapter. We learn about family traumas, family squabbles. Each character is likable and amusing, and each will face down a difficult challenge before this novel ends. I truly enjoyed reading this one. Have fun."
3,Good but not great,"I was very excited about reading Ms. McMillan's new book, I suggested it as our selection for April's book to read for our bookclub group. I have to say that I was very disappointed with the book. The characters are exciting, but Terry takes to long to have the characters interact with each other. They never seem like they are talking to each other, it feels like I am reading a diary. In each chapter you are reading another characters point of view, I would have liked to have the characters come together and interact. I was bored with the delay in bringing the characters together. It was not quick reading for me, It was not as exciting as her other books that I have read. I did not get excited about reading this book until the last 2 chapters, I can say that I was not disappointed with the ending, but why did I have to wait until the very end to start really enjoying the book."
3,She's Back!,"If this ain't real life...don't know what is. I did find this book quite similar to ""Momma,"" but enjoyed it nonetheless. Keep writing Terry."
4,"Loved it, but I'm puzzled","I adored this book. It's funny, creative, well-written. But I am so puzzled about the number of reviews that say they identify with it so closely, and that is so like ""real"" life. I admit I am a middle-class, 50-something, white woman, but I certainly don't consider the characters in this family ""normal"". The men I know may not be perfect, but they aren't all as dispicable as Terri portrays virtually all of her male characters. Now, the sibling rivalry between the sisters made me giggle - I see this all the time. And the domineering mother - she's a hoot, and I know a number of them. Please, somebody tell me. Am I just naive, or is this really considered normal to others."
5,"""family problems""","This book took me away from my problems at home. Just to know I'm not the only one with ""family"". I laughed, I cried, and I read it all over again."
4,Very Satisfying Read,"The strength of Terry McMillan's writing is the strong characterization. At her best, (Mama, Disapearing Acts) her characters are just like folks we know - our mamas, our girl friends, our men. Their actions and lives ring true to us and when they talk, they often crack us up. We become vested in what happens to them. We root for them because they want what we want. And if they get it, so can we.Though Exhale and Stella were both wildly successful, to me they were less satisfying than the either of the earlier two works. Stella, certainly had it moments but left me with the feeling Terry had hardly worked up a sweat, ah writing the book that is.And then there was A Day Late and a Dollar Short. This is a wonderful exploration of familial relationships with some of her strongest writing yet. There were passages that I just had to stop and go back and reread. Poignant and heartwarming, Day Late is Terry McMillan back at the top of her game. I highly recommend it."
3,O. K.,"The story was ok, a little long and a version of the movie ""Soul Food"" in writing with some different events. The story was to long and after reading it for a while, I sort of wanted to hurry up and finish it. Very emotional, to long, overall it was okay."
4,EMOTIONAL,"It's been a long time since I have cried this much while reading a book. The characters were repeats of MAMA, but it's been so long since I read MAMA, That I have forgotten the plots. I was so into this book that I wanted to get in and talk to each person and share their lives. I could relate to the quarrels and most of the problems. This book gave me answers to problems in my own family. This was realness at it's best. Thank you Terry for telling the story for so many of us."
4,"Funny, good but language too rough!",I read this book dealing with a black family from a white point of view and I really did like it. The feelings and emotions they all experienced truly did cross any racial boundaries. My only real objections was the language they all used. I really don't think everybody talks this way. Or at least I hope not! I like the variety of problems that the character were carrying. I did really enjoy it but again I would not recommend due to the Exteme number of obsenities.
5,A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT - IS RIGHT ON TIME!,I love this book! It was very touching and emotional as well as extremely funny! What can I say Terry you done it again!Read this book! If you have any un-answered feelings or questions about amember of your family this book my help you understant their dilenma. We are all attached to some of the characters in this book one way or another.While reading I found myself tearing up and wanting to call all of my family and tell them I love them because one day it might be A Day Late!
2,Not one of my favorites,"I could go on and on here but in my personal opinion i couldn't get into this book because i thought that it lacked character development. As much as I tried i couldn't feel for, understand, of related to the characters. That lack of emotional attachment filtered into the book so it was hard for me to get through. :("
5,Terry McMillan's book is right on time!,"Another terrific book from Terry McMillan and I think that she progressively matures in her work. This book is a gut-busting, gaffaw-out-loud, 2001 look at the complications of family life at middle age. Each chapter of the book is ""written"" by a different member of Viola's family (including herself of course as the matriarch of the brood). This gives readers an excellent insider's view of each character while giving you the ""whole picture"" of their dysfunctional selves and relationships. (The good news is that there is a happy ending and hope for functionality). It's McMillan's typical gossipy, lively, trendy, characterizations. You'll recognize yourself (or at least someone you know) in every chapter. A FUN read!!"
4,A Brilliant Read,"As a first time reader of Terry McMillan I thought this book was fantastic. Every character is well written and has a ""real person"" feel about them. A real insight into families and their misconceptions about each other. Couldn't put this down and can't wait to get a hold of more of McMillan's work."
1,Not A Good Read,"This book was way too expository. The characters' monologues revealed too much and violated the ""show don't tell"" policy that EVERY CREATIVE WRITING STUDENT IS TOLD. A cliche, yes, but it is nonetheless true. Aside from their manner of speaking, there was not much difference in the personality of each character. And the monologues ran on for too long--I wanted more scenes, more action, more dialogue that revealed the character rather the character telling the reader what they are like. The tough issues raised in this novel were glossed over. Why bring up such matters if they can't be handled with more depth instead of being explained away in one sentence: ""Oh, she doesn't have that problem anymore."" All in all, the book was too expository, it was not well written, and it was Mama: The Sequel! Better yet, ""The Price Monologues."""
3,An OK read,"I have all of Terry McMillian's novels and they were really good, but this one, I just couldn't seem to get into. Loved Waiting To Exhale and Disappearing Acts better."
5,Terry at her best!!!,"This is the best book I've read in awhile. I loved the characters, and the book left me wanting more. It was so real, and I saw some of these characters in my own family. Makes me wonder what they're all up to now. Great job Ms. McMillan."
5,Best Book To Start The New Year!!!!,"A Day Late and a Dollar Short is definatly the best book I have read in a long while. It took me a long time to find a book I that I could really get lost in and this one hit the spot. Not only is it a good read, but you come to know and love the characters as if you were a part of the Price family. Every page was a revelation. Every word kept me hooked. By the end, I felt like a member of the family."
4,FOR CHORE CHART,THESE ARE THE STICKERS MY GRAND DAUGHTER GETS WHEN SHE DOES A CHORE AND SHE LOVES PUTTING THEM ON HERSELF AND THEN POINTING TO THEM OFTEN AS TO WHY SHE GOT TO DO IT. SHE LOVES ELMO !
4,Melange of classics,"What is not to like about music that carries the listener to distant lands and imbues a sense of animation and fun. Kabalevsky the Comedians has been used by many nature programs to capture the antics and elan of nature's comedians, river otters. The two travelogues by Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov provide a wonderous magical trip for listeners that capture and share the souls of Italy and Spain."
5,Unbroken is definately on my top 10 list.,"I love the mixture of unique instruments like banjo, violin, and flute that Eryca used on her latest release, Unbroken. Her soulful lyrics really show her talent as a song writer. My favorite song on the album is ""When We Believe"", it has a great message about faith and the instrumentation is great! I would love to hear Eryca's music on the radio."
1,incomprehensible,"This is the most incomprehensible book I've read in years, possibly ever. The author isn't self-conscious enough to be pretentious; he seems totally unaware that his style is often impenetrable, obscuring and obfuscating what seem to be an assortment of interesting ideas. Faulkner at his most opaque reads like ""See Jane run"" compared to this mess. Avoid."
3,Mixed emotions,"Yitzhak Shamir's statement had disgraced him - anti semitism in Europe cannot be denied - what also cannot be denied is that Poland was the only European country to give Jewish citizens rights, and had the only government which publicly stood up for its Jewish population when other countries scoffed. I resented statements that seem to project the idea that Poland was somehow to blame for the Holocaust - the German Army was to blame. I think although the author provided some excellent information and history not readily available elsewhere, he also forgot that Hitler's policy was to also exterminate Poles - and that in many concentration camps the first victims were Poles. There wasn't enough comparative info in the book, for example about America's role in denying the Holocaust during the war - even though Polish people cried out about what was going on."
2,K Source Honda Accord replacement mirror,"The mirror was supposed to be a direct fit, but it turned out to be anything but. I had to go to a body shop who ended up swap parts from the old mirror to the new in order to get it to fit in the door cavity, and also use new self-tapping screws to anchor it properly to the door. They also had to heat up the plastic and bend it so that there would be no gap between the mirror and the door panel."
2,low quality video,"Seller sent item in a timely manner and in new packaging, however, the video itself is low quality, with very old characters/decor and toddler isn't too crazy about."
1,DDR Ultramix 4 - Like an LSD trip? Not so good for exercise,"Ultramix 4 needs improvement. The background is very distracting (like an LSD trip in the movies) and makes it hard to follow the arrows while you are dancing. It is definitely not for anyone prone to migraines or seizures. The grading is harsher than Ultramix 2. Whereas you would pass in Ultramix 2, you fail in this game. When you fail, the game ends, and you don't get the exercise. The whole point for us is to get a good workout in a fun way. We recommend Ultramix 2 over this one."
1,DDR-4,We have DDR's 1-4 now. We enjoy the new music. The only complaint I have is that the graphics used in the background sometimes overpower trying to see the dance arrows. I wish background visuals were an option that the user could control.
2,I wish it had more techno-pop songs,"Is it just me or is DDR2 Ultramix still the best? I do believe the story mode is easier then DDR3 Ultramix, however it has the same problem as DD3, where there are not a whole lot of techno-j-pop type songs that I love DDR for. DDR1 and DDR2 are still my favorite. This songs seem to move slower and the steps seem to be less complex the other versions. Overall I think it will appeal to younger players who are not big on techno. If you are a big fan of the old DDR songs, I would not suggest you upgrade to DDR4 Ultramix."
4,DDR Ultramix4,A very active game like all the other DDR series.Had great music and is easy for beginners to start with.
5,Awesome!,This game is awesome! My grandmother got it for my sister and I for Christmas. We got the dance mats too.
4,Magazine for ALL interested in wooden boats,"It is true that this magazine isn't written for women. It is written for ALL who are interested in the technicalities, art and beauty of wooden boat building and restoration. If you want a magazine that is targeted specifically for women, it is true that you are looking in the wrong place. I personally happen to truly enjoy this magazine. This is regardless of the fact that I am through and through a woman!This publication offers everything the reader would expect. The cover says it is ""the magazine for wooden boat owners, builders, and designers"". The content matches the promise."
5,This Magazine is for EVERYBODY!,The person who reviewed this magazine earlier says it is not for women. What abunch of bull. The reviewer even admits that he/she has never even read the magazine. Well if that isn't prejudice. No wonder the Isreali that wrote that review has so many problems in his/her country... PREJUDICE!
4,Wonder Pets,I think that my child watches this one the most. The songs are fun and it has good animals in this episode.
3,bad marketing,"my grandaughter enjoys the wonder pets and likes the DVD. I however have a serious problem with the fact that once you start it, it will not let you access the menu. Your child must sit through 4 or 5 ads for other DVDs unless you want to stay there and manually skip each one. It also won't let you stop the DVD during this time. That is a marketing ploy I very much resent."
2,Its all episodes we have seen,My son loves the wonderpets and we watch them over and over. I was excited about the NEW dvd. When it arrived it was just episodes we had seen many times. My son still loves it and we may give it to grandma to keep at her house where there is no tivo.
4,Short and Sweet,"My two year old loves this DVD and I am not annoyed by it- even when it's set to repeat (you know how rare that is). It also comes with a set of stickers that I put on my little guy's sippy cup. He was thrilled. In my opinion, this DVD is worth every penny."
5,Wonderful Wonder Pets,"I have been a huge fan of the Wonder pets for almost a year now, and I don't know how I could not fall in love with this amazing children's series. The Wonder Pets teach children a valuable lesson in cooperation and doing good deeds for others. With Lenny's leadership, Tuck's quick wit, and Ming Ming's quirky phrases, the Wonder Pets are an absolute ""little"" crowd pleaser. I would definately recommend adding the WonderPets to any child's DVD collection."
5,GO-WONDERPETS!,"I love this show! I have seen them all over and over and over. My age you ask-56 years old! I have loved it since the first episode and now have my 6 year old granddaughter hooked on it. I tell everyone about it. A great show for young and old. Thnak you for putting out this DVD, and I am buying the CD at the same time. My granddaughter will love it too."
5,Try to NOT get this stuck in your head!,"Wonder Pets, Wonder Pets, We're on our way!:)This show is wonderful for the younger set, with catchy songs, interesting characters, and educational circumstances... with the occasional comment that will have the parents rolling on the floor."
4,Excellent for the Little Ones!,"All I can say is that since my 2-year old got this for his birthday he runs into the house after day-care and says ""Pets? More pets???"". I think that says it all. And yes, I agree with an earlier review - I cannot get that title song out of my head!!! LOL :) This is a MUST if you want your child to be kind to animals. Enjoy!"
5,Comfortable and Sexy,"This is the first time I bought a pair of heels as this. I was a bit nervous of the comfort level being they are 6"" and with a platform base. To my surprise, they were actually quite comfortable, the paddding is really good and the strap near the toes are great too. Now all I need is practice. Great heels tho, I plan to buy more of this particular brand in the future."
5,North American Indian,"I bought this book a few years ago for my kids. Recently, my son was doing a report on Apache Indians. I was amazed to find that an original photo I found on the internet matched the book illustration quite well. Everything in the book matched and sometimes exceeded all of the information that my son had on various Indian tribes. A simple, beautifully done introduction to American Indians for children!! I am going to buy a few more copies to give to my son's school library."
5,Children in the United States should have knowledege of American Indians. This is a good starting point.,"Living in the U.S. we can easily lose sight of the fact that before Europeans and other immigrants came to the U.S., the country was populated by American Indians. This book is a good introduction to the various major Indian tribes in the U.S. It's good for 2nd or 3rd grade, possibly 4th grade, although the actual pronunciation of the tribes might be difficult for some kids.The book has nice, soft, detailed illustrations on each page, and a short summary on each tribe. The actual description of each tribe might be only 75 words, but between the description and the detailed illustrations, children will form a well-rounded undestanding of those who lived in America for centuries before most of their/our ancestors arrived here. This is a vital chunk of history to inculcate in the mind/psyche of a child."
5,Greaat Children's Book,My grandsons were fascinated with this book. Now they want more stories like this one.
1,North American Indians,"This book talks about different Indian tribes, but it is very brief. Only couple of sentences about each tribe. It is like a summary in few words or information flyer. It is not enough to learn much. You can get that type of summary online from wikipedia and don't have to buy a book for it."
1,Amazon sucks!,"I bought this because I have a take home final to do, but amazon is making me wait until tomorrow before I can download it! I don't understand why I can't download it now, there is a message in my account saying the order is being processed. What needs to be processed?!? I am very upset, and I am never going to buy any kind of e-book, download, or anything that requires downloading from amazon again! I highly suggest that no one does until amazon fixes the problems. Amazon sucks!"
4,Fan since Da Committee,"A mix between LA and Bay Area flavors, but definitely West Coast. Not the typical gangsta [stuff]. ""Party"" is the party anthem of the album. More than 3 hits on the album. Both artists are lyrically inclined."
4,How did I live without them ?,"Seriously, I've seen a lot of reviews insulting these new miniatures. Like the elf archer with an unpainted bow... maybe some of them are painted, just to make it different? Or the bow could always be made of darkwood, use your imagination, it IS a fantasy game. I love the fact the figures are hardcore plastic and prepainted, I really don't have the time or patience to paint the old metal ones. Not to mention the price ... the Entry pack alone, which has 16 random mini's, costs less at full price than one of the old set with only five characters. Why complain ? Be happy and rejoice in the laziness of it... and my orc army! Mwahahahahaa!"
3,Must be nice...,"I've ordered 4 boosters, 1 entry, and a miniatures handbook on september 2, 2003 - yet i still havn't recieved a notice from Amazon.ca..."
4,Good for the action scenes,"These are one of those action packed movies where the storyline is not that important.Just entertainment, that's for sure."
2,Lara Croft Cradle of Life,The DVD was scratched and the movie stopped twice during viewing. It took several attempts to fast forward to get past the stalled part.
2,It's all hype,"Looking over her body of work confirms to me that I have never actually enjoyed any of Angelina Jolie's movies and some of her movies aren't even real movies but visual showcases. She's watchable and talented but she doesn't seem to get good movie roles. Maybe she looks too lush but many of her roles involve her looking like the archetypal beautiful vampiress. When she dyes her hair white or changes her accent, I tend to lose attention. I like the actress but there's been nothing I like with her in it. Gia showcased her ability to intimidate but perhaps like Elizabeth Taylor, this actress's career and fame exists despite the paucity of her roles even in old favorites with Montgomery Clift. Remember Butterfield 8?"
4,Good action for people who love Action,"Please don't take this the wrong way. I love seeing women being the main character in movies, as being the action hero. I enjoy seeing women kick butt."
5,"Great movies,","Great action packed movies, Angelina really made this movie worth seeing, just wish I had got it in Blu-Ray instead of DVD, but they are still great movies either way."
3,Not quite there.,"This is one of Maclean's earlier efforts and it unfortunately comes across as such. The plot is, as always, excellent, but the actual writing is a little laboured. It is noticeable that telling the story in the first person creates a difficulty for the writer, with small irritations becoming manifestly larger as the book goes on: I nearly screamed at the number of times the author used the word ""chagrin"" to explain the feelings of Mason, the lead character. But this is all too negative. The story is a very good one, you are kept guessing throughout (as with every Maclean novel) and the book ends on one of the more gruesome, and therefore good, ways to die in any fictitious medium"
1,Not an actual Alistair Maclean,"This edition of 'Night without End' is not the original version of the novel. The text has been adapted and shortened, for the sake of people wanting to learn or improve their English.This is not clearly indicated in the information about the book. So be aware of this before you consider purchasing it."
3,Not a regular paperback,This book is not a trade paperback. It is a condensed reader for new readers. It is a type of textbook.
4,Maclean is one of the Greatest....,"What can I say about Alistair Maclean? He is an all-time great and his stories have touched millions or people and been published in several languages. This is my first review of any of his work, but it is not the first novel of his that I have read.Maclean has a beautifully descriptive touch to his writing. He also has a great way of making the reader sit on seat's edge, anticipating the next page and chapter of the novel. This story was all of that, for me.I did like the first person narrative. It proved an unusual perspective to the story.I am looking forward to reading more of Maclean's work and writing more reviews on them. I am a long-time fan of the late author and I miss the fact that his stories have ended."
2,Not the book,"Quite disappointing. Thought this edition was a complete novel. Instead, it was an abridged version with ""helpful"" comments to ""improve"" the reader's comprehension skills. Unless you are beginning high school, (or younger), the book is useless."
2,Bad rating for incredibly poor proofing of ALL Alistair MacLean novels on Amazon,"I have bought a number of the Alistair MacLean novels from Amazon to replace my badly thumbed paperbacks, which I enjoyed in my youth. The novels are still enjoyable. However, I would expect that there would have been some proofing of what is obviously a scanned version of the book. If it was free I would not complain. But it's not - the Kindle book is riddled with typos that a simple spell checker would have picked up.When you are paying between $8 to $10 for these old novels, you expect some quality!!!While the first typo for 'fact', which was scanned as 'fart', was mildly amusing, when it occurred every time and in every MacLean novel, it was no longer funny.I am not sure what the publisher or Amazon do for the money you pay, but this is pathetic!! Where is Amazon's quality control."
4,A good solid story by MacLean.,"I have read about one-third of MacLean's books, and have just finished reading Night Without End. I thought that the story was very entertaining and well developed. Like many MacLean books that I have read I felt as if it could have been a great movie. The characters were interesting and like always I was not sure exactly who had done what, and his first person perspective is always as descriptive as it is limiting. Overall, I heartily enjoyed the book."
3,A good adventure for a winter night,"Four hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle. An airliner crashes in the Polar ice-cap. In temperatures forty degrees below zero, six men and four women survive. But for the members of a remote scientific research station who rescue them, there are some sinister questions to answer - the first one being, who shot the pilot before the crash?"
3,The exciting story,"This book is told via a main character, Dr. Mason, who is a scientist that find out why the plane fly so far away from its normal rout? I think this is a good strategy of writer to make the story interesting. Additionally it has an excellent introduction, good arrangement and has an attractive story that I can not put it down until the end. However, in any opinion some chapters still have a puzzle that makes me doubt and does not give the answer for me. Moreover the last chapter is quite short. Nevertheless, I still recommend this book, if you looking for an exciting story."
1,Two Lemons,"This gun feels good. Accurate & quiet.Downsides are: 395fps weak. You can see the shot go down field. The ""compensator"" is cosmetic only. Annoying grip safety. Thumb safety didn't always work.I've tried two of these now & had to return both due to mechanical misfire. The problem with the first: The cylinder didn't rotate after the first shot. The problem with the second. Cylinder didn't index with the barrel in semi-auto. Shot would end up sticking out of the front of the magazine bent to the left.I will not try my luck a third time with this model. Awaiting the shipment of a Walther CP88...Update: Walther CP88 has become the favorite pistol of my collection."
3,Detailed account,"VERY detailed account of Jefferson during the his life in Virginia. Although it had in depth description of the political structure, the people, and Jefferson's involvement in the politics of the United States and Virginia, it did not include a very detailed account of his personal life as is best depicted through letters. Surprisingly, despite Jefferson's extensive correspondence during the 41 years that the book covers, this correspondence was not used sufficiently to shed further light on Jefferson's personal life and intimate thoughts. Additionally, Dumas Malone did not focus enough on one of Thomas Jefferson's greatest contribution - the drafting of the Declaration of Independence."
2,disappointing,"I bought the six volumes because of the positive reviews by by experts. However, I agree with some of the critical consumer reviews that the text contains too many details thatr sometimes obscure the main events and that Malone sees Jefferson as a great man with hardly any faults. I think that Jefferson is a very interesting, important and enigmatic man and I have tried to find a biography that is more balanced. I doubt if ther is such a biography and that is very odd. Has no historian been able to do him credit?"
1,Would not recommend this product,"This product is labeled for ages 9 - 12 years old, but is very juvenile. It would appeal to children in kindergarten, but definitely not ages 9 - 12. There were also some glitches in the product that made it lock up."
5,Witting and Delicious,I've read this book many times and very much love it. Bagshawe's work may be a bit repetitive in terms of plot out line but I thouroughly (sp?) enjoy the catty remarks that fly and the raw ambition of women through this novel
1,Hillbilly garbage,R. Kasten doesn't know what he's talking about because NO self-respecting REAL hippie would EVER listen to any of this hillbilly junk!!!!
5,Fantastic,I heard Sam for the first time play with Lyle Lovett last summer. It was an amazing show with Sam on the mandolin. This album has met all my expectations for great blue grass. Same Ol' River simply rocks.
5,great product for men,"This is an excellent formula for men's prostate health! It contains specific herbs and nutrients that protect the prostate against free radicals, keeps the cells healthy, and helps with the problems of aging - i.e. frequent trips to the bathroom at night, urination urgency, you think you're done and as soon as you walk away, you realize you're not, etc. My husband has prostate cancer and this product, along with Econugenics ""Mens Longevity Essentials Plus"" (a men's multi-vitamin) has made a tremendous difference in how he feels. These products, along with a healthy diet, a wonderful doctor who uses a multi-faceted approach that includes alternative treatments, have made his life, as he calls it ""the best!"". My husband and I totally recommend Econugenics Integrated Prostate Care. Plus, Amazon sells it for a great price."
4,Lovely collection of Alfie stories,"My son (nearly 4) has loved Alfie since he was 2. He wants ""Alfie gets in First"" every bedtime. Just beware that this edition is a US edition, and does not feature the original words, using Americanisms that feel weird if you have read the original. e.g. (Alfie's mum is called ""Mom""). I think that if you want the original wording you need to look for the ""Alfie Treasury""."
3,Mapping boundaries.,"The current boundary between Germany and Poland, along the Oder and Neisse rivers, was the last of many changes in the line that separated German and Polish governments. Controversial during the Cold War, it produced this study in the 1960s. The appeal for the modern reader lies in its excellent color maps, which detail the castles of the Teutonic knights, the borders of the 18th century partitions of Poland, the changes created at the end of two World Wars, and the movements of German-speaking populations."
3,En Un Acto,"The plays in the book taught me so much about the cultures in different countries of Latin America. I especially liked the story of ""Los Fantoches."" The symbolism in that play portrays life and death in so many levels."
2,only one side of story,"this book is a one-sided account of the whole issue. If you insist on reading it, only do so in combination with one of the more substantial and famous books on the subject such as why marry jewish."
3,not all that great,"This book was better than I expected. I was bored to death with the other books I read by this author, so it was a pleasant surprise when I discovered this book was simply boring and not simply horrible. I don't like to give bad reviews but you simply must be warned that this is still an awful book. I am a child that reads as much as I possibly can, I enjoy books that have cleverness and surprises, twists and turns, intelligent humer and witt. This book possesses none of these qualities. Somehow it seemed as though nothing actually happened in this book. If you enjoy books with no action and horses, read this book. If not....well either skip this or know you have been warned."
5,The Morgan's Past,This is a great and true story about the beginning of the Morgan horse. Little Bub can capture the hearts of adults and children alike!
3,Another Great Book from Marguerite Henry,I couldn't put it down! So fast-paced I was finished in a jiffy! This story is about a small colt that no one thought was worth anything because of his tiny size.When he grew up he became known for his strength and quickness. True story about how the race of Morgan horses started!
1,CENSORED,"For $14.98 (MSRP) this disc will reward you with a murky, washed-out 4:3 picture riddled with blemishes, spots, and streaks; audio accompanied by an incessant humming sound; and a thoroughly censored version of an otherwise entertaining Spanish/Mexican drama. If you're hoping to see Leticia Perdigon's full frontal nudity here, forget it. Censored. Ironically this is one movie wherein she bares more of herself than she does in her other films. As for Spanish cutie Veronica Miriel, her full frontal scenes are also cut. At least the censors weren't as offended by breasts and backsides as much as they were by vaginas. The original film has a run time of approximately 100 minutes, but this version is pitifully pared down to 83 minutes (the 90-minute run time listed on Amazon is inaccurate)."
2,I want to like it more than I do...,"Cal comes from a difficult background, he has abandonment issues, and it seems the only family that has has exited poverty is Uncle Trevor, and he is even more emotionally unavailable than mom. Long story short, only (2) stars because, the premise was good, but character development was incomplete. This story has a protagonist that is hard to like and even harder to sympathize with. Some of the best parts of the book, the Company, Fisher King, and Corbenic are only used to support Cal' s personal psychological analysis and NOT as interdependent storylines that come to life early in the book. Frustrating book, decent enough read."
3,"Intense, thrilling but loses control and crashes","The film's plot is a smart and entertaining thriller which brings you on this wild ride, but as it nears to the end it shoots down hill. With a young fresh cast the movie plays out really well, Cillian Murphy plays the villain brilliantly as you really feel threatened and scared of what this person is capable of. Rachel Mcadams plays the helpless girl who decides to fight back nicely.Wes Craven is a brilliantly Director as he has done such great movies like A Nightmare On Elm Street and Scream. But his one big problem is the cheesy endings in which he gives his films, I am sorry to say his done it again. A good movie up until the end where it loses cabin pressure and crashes."
2,"Average thriller, fun to watch, forgotten instantly","This is a pretty typically thriller with the usual plot twists and unlikely occurrances. While watching it, it has its fun, suspenseful moments, provided you don't think much. There are more holes in the storyline than stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Still, I can't say I didn't enjoy parts of it, but I wouldn't go around telling anyone that it's a must see."
1,oh,"This movie is really really bad. Bad dialouge. Bad plot. Not scary, and so not funny. Bad acting. It's basically an insult to other movies."
5,Rachel McAdams at her best! Amazing Thriller!,"A woman is kidnapped by a stranger on a routine flight. Threatened by the potential murder of her father, she is pulled into a plot to assist her captor in offing a politician. - - [...]OK so the plot is pretty simple. If you don't do this, then I will kill your Dad. But if you do do this, then you kill someone else. So whats the choice?Plain and simple huh? Well the movie had a lot more going for it. As the main character, Rachel McAdams is a strong and willing hero. She plays the character to a ""T"" and with Cillian Murphey as the creepy man threatening her, the acting is amazing. Cillian Murphey has a certain scaryness to him and the plot keeps rolling in the movie. I would recommend it to ANYONE as it is very entertaining. The acting is worth the money alone!"
2,"Thoroughly predictable ""thriller""","The only thing that kept this from being ABSOLUTELY predictable was that a dead bad guy did NOT spring back to life. I found myself saying ""Oh come on"" to one plot point after another (previous reviewers have covered these absurdities). The underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving (previous reviews in this thread provide details)."
3,Better Than Flightplan,"This movie is much better than Flightplan the other thriller plane flick that came out shortly after this one. This movie is hinged and succeeds solely on the ability of the two leads, Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are really good in this movie. The story is passable filler with no real thrills but it's decent enough for passing time.Worth a watch, not much else."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though it begins inventively and features a creepy Cillian Murphy, Red Eye quickly degrades into just about the most formulaic thriller you can imagine; look elsewhere if you want a movie that has something of interest beyond a laughably bad final shot."
2,Predictable!,"This is one of the most predictable movies I have seen in a long time. It did not play up to it's potential and the previews made it look much better than it actually was. The acting was good, but I wouldn't waste my money with buying this movie."
1,Can anyone tell me what happened to Wes Craven?,"Ok, what the heck happened to Wes Craven? Apparently, he turned into a lackluster hack. This movie was categorized as a ""suspense/thriller"" HA! What a joke. The movie wasn't the worst one I've seen but it was far from suspenseful or thrilling. The first 20 minutes of the film showed promise but when the plane took off, it went downhill from there. The big professional, threatening bad guy turned out to be a big wimp and poorly cast as well...it just wasn't working. I was glad when she stabbed him in the throat because I was really hoping that would shut him up. The whole plot was a joke as well. Don't bother with this one unless you are really desperate."
5,Woohoo!,"I was really impressed with the quality of my used copy of Red Eye. There was absolutely no scratches or glitches on the product whatsoever, and I'm thankful for that because although I have ordered movies from Amazon before, I always have my doubts."
4,FRIGHTPLAN...,"Hotel manager Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is on the red eye flight home after attending her grandmother's funeral. She is seated next to a young man named Jackson (Cillian Murphy from 28 Days Later and Sunshine) whom she had met earlier in the terminal. The two get along famously, until Jackson reveals his secret. Lisa is now part of a plot involving political assassination and the life of her own father (Brian Cox from Manhunter and The Ring)! Surrounded by a plane-full of clueless passengers, Lisa must figure out a way to stop Jackson's plan and save several lives. RED EYE is horror director Wes Craven's shot at a straight-out thriller, and he comes through just fine. The tension mounts while Lisa and Jackson are in the air, and culminates in a wham-bam finalé on the ground! Well worth seeing and owning..."
1,Come on...,"Anyone who gets kidnapped on a plane has got to be the most retarded person alive... Your in a what... Hallway for 3 hours? With a slew of other people on the plane? And this guy wants to win an election? The heck is wrong with this situation? Hmm, maybe all of it? Yeah, all of it. This movie was not horrible, it was worse than horrible, it had to be the biggest piece of garbage ever. I would say Boycott... But Im under 13 and as of thus far, I dont know what that even means yet."
3,Red Eye,"I love Rachael McAdams, so when I saw she was starring in this movie I was excited to see it. What a disappointment, the storyline is boring amd once you watch it I can't see watching it again. McAdams performance is great, as usual, but it hardly makes up for the $4 I spent renting this movie.I would not buy this movie."
2,"OK, entertaining one-timer/rental","I saw ""Red Eye"" at the theater, namely because it had Cillian Murphy, and I had just seen ""Batman Begins,"" in which he plays Scarecrow. I figured, any movie with Murphy playing the creepy villain he has played before would be worth seeing.And Red Eye was an entertaining slice of B-movie type cheese, held together with the performances of its lead actors -- Murphy and Rachel McAdams. (hey, Murphy and McAdams).The setup was better than the eventual conclusion, but it was a nice two-hour diversion. And if you haven't seen it yet, it's probably worth a rental, not a purchase. The movie doesn't have enough substance/depth to it to warrant a deeper look. There's really nothing you can't grasp on a first viewing, and under greater scrutiny, there's at least one glaring plothole.Unless either Murphy or McAdams are your favorite actors, you can pass up on buying ""Red Eye."""
3,Don't know what movie the rest of you saw,"Look, I love Rachel McAdams, she is the next big thing.This is a good vehicle for her in some ways. However, this movie is not suspenseful, one or two scenes maybe. McAdams rises above an otherwise by the book ""thriller"". You do care about her character. Brian Cox quite literally phones in his performance.Cillian Murphy is creepy admittedly. It is timely with regards to its terrorism angle. Not even going to say this movie could have been much better. It's just a weak plot all in all. Sorry, but thumbs down."
1,Probably the worst film I have ever seen,"I brought this film because I saw a trailer a while back and thought it looked quite interesting and different. However within the first 10 minutes of watching it me and the person I was watching it with were shocked as to has bad the acting was. That was my first impression. I was told to stick it out, so I did. I'm affraid it got worse.If you want a poorly acted dreadfully directed predictable film about a over written plot which makes no sense, this is the film for you. And the line at the end, ""shove it up your..."" classic"
2,"Absolutely painful comedy, I mean thriller, to watch","I give it two stars because the beginning was somewhat entertaining and it has Cillian Murphy in it (who I think is just now starting to hit his stride). But overall, the movie s-t-i-n-k-s. I have seen better acting in amateur plays. Additionally, I was laughing at the supposed intense parts - pitiful."
4,Flying's a #itch!,"Red Eye starring Rachel McAdams is a great thrill ride. The film takes place on a plane, hence the title and she meets a seemingly nice man played by Cillian Murphy. Lisa (McAdams) is terrified of fying but that fear suddenly evaporates when her fellow passenger threatens to kill her father, don't want to give too much away but Red Eye which is directed by Wes Craven will have you creeped out right 'til the very end. Enjoy!"
4,Not Exactly the Friendly Skies!,"Rachel McAdams is a hotel manager flying home for her grandmother's funeral. She sits next to a guy she met at the airport, and he says that if she doesn't help him assassinate a top diplomat, her dad will die. He wants her to move the diplomat to a different hotel room than normal so that they can kill him in that particular room.The movie is a thriller and even though it is not completely unpredictable, it is good, suspenseful entertainment, and you'll escape from the boredom and stress of your lives for 90 minutes."
3,Red Eye,"Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy are superb together in this action packed thriller. Red Eye is by far both of their best performances. Especially for Cillian Murphy, a character whom you just can`t take your eyes off of. Red Eye was an absolutely huge improvement over Wes Craven`s flop Cursed, an excellent comeback with Red Eye. This film focuses mainly on the characters which is very good and there were a few special effects which were well done. It kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next."
2,"Hokey, But the End is Sort of Satisfying","Girl who works in hotel goes to airport to fly back home after funeral. She has previously been attacked by a stranger in a parking lot. Proceeds to spill life story to weird-looking stranger in airport. Ends up sitting next to weird stranger on plane. Turns out he wants to kill Head of Homeland Security who will be staying in the hotel she works at. Forces her to make call on in-flight phone or her dad will be killed (he'll call one of his people). Weird stranger has no weapon, only a cell phone which he can't use on the plane. Personally, I would have stood up and yelled, have everyone on plane tie him up and stomp him, but then movie would have been a lot shorter.Bad writing, silly story, but could have been worse I supppose."
3,Should have been better,"If the lead villian didn't look like Jackson Brown, this may have been more realiatic. In the chase scenes, I kept asking myself ""Who would be afraid of this guy?"" He looks like a total wuss. This guy would be better of playing a part where he is tring to get revenge from the people who stole his lunch money in middle school, because that is about how believable he looks.The film overall was not bad. One may have wished for a better ending, but that seems like the trend for movies from this era"
5,A Suspenseful Thriller,"Lisa is certainly having a bad day. Returning from her grandmother's funeral she meets a man who seems quite likeable, but is really a villian. Lisa works as a manager at a hotel in Miami where the deputy secretary of homeland security and his family are taking a room. Our villian tells Lisa she is to help him put this man and his family in a position to be killed or her father will die. What would you do?At first the movie is slow going as the plot is laid, but once this fiesty woman decides to fight back hold onto your hat.She's stuck between a rock and a hard place but is determined not to be the loser. I felt this movie had a great story, really good acting and I loved the way it ended. A giggle after the suspense was icing on the cake. I think you'll like this one and recommend you give it a try."
2,Cillian Murphy is the best thing about this film!,"I'm sorry but there are just too many things about this plot that is left to coincidence. How could the bad guys plan the plane delay and what if the Homeland Security person simply refuse to move? Plus the darn missle nearly knocked out the whole floor. Seems to me that it didn't need to be that exact room. I liked the fact that heroine had a steel backbone and didn't need any rescuing. It's also very scary how both parties were able to escape the airport after landing after she stabbed him in the neck. 9/11 hasn't changed much (which is probably closer to reality than I like think).Overall, I can't believe this elaborate plan to kill the Homeland Security director all hendged on a hotel manager--but whatever."
2,D.O.A not that thrilling at all,not once did i think to my self something bad could happen to this girls dad maybe she didint play the part that good or maybe the plot sucked or both. but this movie feels like a rip off of air force one in a sence. if you wanna watch a movie about hostages watch the movie HOSTAGE and if you want to watch a good movie by WES CRAVEN watch a nightmare on elm street
2,Pointless Formulaic Snoozefest - Craven needs a blood transfusion,"Glossy as any Hollywood cookiecutter thriller, this marks a low point in Wes Craven's career. Wes Craven has disowned his earliest, most twisted works, and his career since Nightmare on Elm Street has been a quest to break out of his horror film cubbyhole. The Scream series was a respectable compromise; he could churn up plenty of rent money by reinventing the slasher film, while demonstrating that he was above it all by cleverly sending up the genre.This movie is not clever, or imaginative, or much of anything other than a waste of time. The plot points are contrived, the director cheats with lazy jumps in the action which undercut any real suspense, and there is nothing we haven't seen done before, and better. Except maybe one scene, and that's not worth the price of admission.Hope ole Wes pocketed some major change for this one. Hitchcock it ain't."
3,Fresh Air,"Did anyone else notice the name of the airplane? Fresh Air. That has GOT to be some kind of attempt at slyness.I am always impressed by Rachel McAdams' acting. She can do anything:Comedy-Mean Girls and Wedding CrashersDrama-The NotebookThrillers-Red EyeI think next to Naomi Watts and Jennifer Connelly, McAdams is my favorite ""actress to watch.""The film itself is okay. It's short and has some great suspenseful moments, but it still isn't GREAT. I can't put my finger on why. It's certainly not the acting. McAdams isn't the only one who does a good job. Cillian Murphy does well as Jack Ripner. Maybe it's the limitations imposed by being set on an airplane for most of the movie. Maybe it's Wes Craven's directing.Bottom Line: a short, suspenseful movie with good acting but a thin plot and mediocre directing from Wes Craven."
4,...fast action and short running time makes [Red Eye] a good thriller,"Red Eye is a fast paced suspenseful thriller from the director of the Scream movies, Wes Craven, and starring Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins).McAdams plays hotel manager Lisa who is on her way to see her father when she meets a mysterious man named Jackson, played brilliantly by Murphy, at the airport right before boarding. While they're on the airplane, Jackson reveals to Lisa that he is plotting to assassinate a homeland security official that is staying at the hotel where Lisa works, and that if she doesn't cooperate with him to move the official to the floor where the killers can get him, her father will die.The movie's fast action and short running time makes it a successful thriller. And it's definitely McAdams and Murphy that turn this simple film into a worthwhile spectacle.RecommendedB-"
4,Fun.,"I wanted to see Red Eye but before I got the chance it got knocked out of the theatres by the rather grim Flightplan. Besides fine direction and plotting, Red Eye has a key element that's missing from many action movies: the actors are not well known. Not that Red Eye has lots of surprises but at least the screen ""personalities"" of the actors cannot be anticipated. They seem like real people, in a very bad situation.A great flight. Short and sweet!"
3,Caught the 9:30 Red Eye,"A very short and simple film. No surprises here. No complex plot, no twists, no deep character development. What you see is what you get. And what you get is an okay way to spend $10.Lisa, a hotel receptionist, is confronted by her seatmate on an airplane to change the room of a high profile businessman/politician (so that he can be assinated) or her father will be killed.Cillian Murphy makes a great villian, as he did in Batman begins. Rachael McAdams looks different from her role in Mean Girls. The cast is the best part of this movie."
4,good film,"these days, all film makers do in horror films, is get a scary looking guy/girl put some flimsy makeup on, a raggy shirt and they appear surprisingly in only ALL of the scenes. it's so pathetic. the only reason those 'horror' movies are scary is because it's instinct to jump when you see this ugly freaky thing pop out at the end of a spine-crawling song. on the other hand, RED EYE was just marvelous. at first, i thought it would be something about a guy with a red eye (cause all the trailers make it look like that) and how he's a crazy maniac who wants to kill her, but as you see in the film, it is not. i think it had such a great plot and Rachel McAdams was just beautiful in the film. Cillian Murphy came out quite hot also. They were both the best actors for this movie and brought the film to life. This film was smart, thrilling and just plain good. You will surely take a flight of fear."
1,one star is indeed one too many,"Let's face facts. This is a terrible, terrible movie. We have to guess that all involved in this project are hiding. Really, I'm generally quite easy on movies, but these pointless dialogues and no discernable plot is perhaps one of the worst movies ever made. Sorry if this seems harsh, but I just don't want anyone to buy it unknowingly."
4,"Red Eye is a flawed, but extremely entertaining thriller.","I enjoyed Red Eye alot, despite hearing about the movie from alot of people who didn't like it. Now there are some plot holes in the screenplay, but the set is original and the execution is still very exciting. Mcadams and Murphy are both good in this movie. (*Note: I also would like to add that I found it a little funnier see the guy who played Scarecrow in Batman Begins getting his ass serviced to him by the girl from The NoteBook.) But despite the movie's flaws, it was pretty good."
1,Takes off and nosedives,"If ever an assassin, where would be the most discreetplace to carry out your diabolical plan? Why, in thecoach section of a major airline of course! It's ano-brainer really; an ideal location where your threats,headbutts and menacing aisle stares will go completelyunnoticed amid post 911 passengers.These terrorists are bold however, and don't give asecond thought to firing off a rocket launcher in broaddaylight, blatantly surveilling your lavish home,assaulting your father and then clumsily chasing yourdaughter around with a 12"" knife.But thank God for the TSA and their intrusive bodyscanners with saved images and pat-downs though,helping to at least minimize these sly, ubiquitousairport terrorists."
3,Classic and Classy Thriller,"Both this movie and Flight Plan came out at roughly the same time, and they both have that main ingredient necessary to make a classic mystery thriller. They both take place in enclosed spaces. With Agatha Christie, it always used to be the old manor house, specifically the library (where the body would be found). Now with movies like Red Eye, we have that ideal claustrophobic setting provided by an airplane. There's no escape. You're locked in there with the villain.In this case, the villain is truly scary. The individual playing that part almost changes facial contours - from initial affability, with just a hint of the sinister - to a physiognamy of outright Hyde-like evil.All the other actors do similarly admirable jobs with their roles.The movie has a rather lame ending - with the usual bloody confrontation between good and evil. But the ride itself is well worth the fare."
1,So bad...,"I've seen a lot of bad movies and this one ranks with the best of the worst! So predictable. Characters are not interesting. Story is boring. Just a movie for someone to make money off. Very sad considering the fact it came from Wes Craven. Was expecting much much more. Do not see this movie, it's a waste of time. If Zero stars was an option I would have clicked on that."
1,The worst Wes Craven film I can remember seeing,"Demonstrates to me that he is essentially at sea without a supernatural leitmotif in his movies, nothing wrong with that but he should stick to what he is good at.This was too plodding and predictable to watch, had to turn it off half way through."
4,Two great Young Actors make this an exciting (and short) ride.,"Red Eye is a film that features two great young actors in Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls, The Notebook, Wedding Chasers) and Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later, Batman Begins) and as a result the movie is very suspenseful and very good and exciting to watch. I say this because the movie is about 90% dialogue between the two of them, especially in the first half-hour or so, and to not have such good actors at the helm could've spelled disaster for this film. It is surprisingly short (about 1 hour and 20 minutes or so), and on top of that moves along very quickly. The script is very good, and you enjoy yourself watching this movie. I'd recommend to anyone who likes suspense/thriller movies."
4,MORE THAN DECENT THRILLER,"This movie feels like a 2 hour episode of 24. What makes it really worthy are the excelent performances by Murphy (very creepy !) and the wonderful, Rachel MacAdams. Only minor complaint is (spoiler ahead), why did the latter try so hard to evade the police when the plane lands instead of simply surrendering ?The movie came out at the same time than Fligth plan which caused some confusion on the people sitting beside me a the theater (when is Jodie Foster going to appear ?)"
2,Red Eye?,"I can think of a better title for this movie: Snoozefest. If this is what a ""suspense"" movie or a ""thriller"" has come to, then I don't want to see another one. I was bored, so very bored. The ending has to be the most ridiculous one to date. If you must see it, rent it first. I was expecting some 'edge of seat' type of movie and was very disappointed. As far as ""Flightplan"" goes, that one isn't much better..."
2,MAYBE WES SHOULD STICK TO HORROR FILMS?,"The first half of RED EYE is fairly suspensful and absorbing mostly due to the excellent evil-doer acting of Cillian Murphy, who ""kidnaps"" our heroine, played by Rachel McAdams, on a red eye flight in order to assassinate a Home Security bigwig. Thriller movies like this rise or fall depending on the quality of the actor playing the villian (and the script backing him or her up). Reference is made to DIE HARD as an example where a strong and interesting villain character made the film. And for the first part of RED EYE we have a suave, clever, smooth, manipulative, dangerous bad guy in Mr. Murphy. Then, suddenly, all that falls apart. Murphy's character becomes a pathetic victim of the super woman heroine. But we won't give away any more plot information. The point is, it went from scary believeable to laugh-out-loud unbelieveable. Wes Cravens, the horror film vet, directed this non-horror effort. Perhaps he should stick to the horror genre in future."
2,Slow and predictible ...,"I love Rachel McAdams and, therefore, came into this movie with bias. However, adoration for her acting wasn't enough to make me believe that this movie is a must-see.The film begins with a deceiving fast-pace vibe ... you think you're in for a plot-twisting ride only to later learn that all you'll ever get thrill from is what you already saw in the trailer.McAdams does her part, as does the directing, but the story is lacking. There was potential to add more twists and such, in my opinion."
3,Made for TV,"When I saw previews for this on TV, it came off as a horror film. I thought the lady was supposed to look into the guy's eye on the airplane and see horrific images in her head or something. Well I finally rent it on DVD(good thing I didn't buy it) and find out that it's just a basic suspense film. One that should have been made for TV. I mean, this film isn't any different than Cellular. I tried to get into the film but the comedy parts keep distracting me from it. If you want an airplane thriller, get Flightplan. Red Eye is alright for what it is, 3 stars."
2,"i was waiting,and waiting,and waiting,and............","FOR THE YAPPING TO END! when it finally did,i was ready to see a good cat and mouse chase.cillian played a very good bad guy in an creepy way.he did his homework and anticipated her evey move.that is until she picked up that pen(thats all ill type on that)very cool!but from that moment on,he went from cunning crimminal to bumbling buffoon. [...].the opening act between the 2 stars was in the airport check-in line.light banter and some coincidental bumping in to each other ensues.finally the yapfest moves onto the plane.here the tension and tears kick in.the wolf has shed his wool.he tells her she must decide between a political guest and his family,whos staying at her hotel or her father.if she refuses,he dies.and shes having a hard time deciding?!?fathers get NO RESPECT! anyway,nice little wannabe thriller that looks as though it was made to remind people wes is still alive."
5,A Change of Pace For Mr. Craven,And I liked it. This is no horror film but is worth the hour and twenty minutes to watch it.
4,Rachel McAdams at her best,"Red Eye is a movie to see because you will laugh and cry, crying because you are laughing so hard. Rachel McAdams is one of the best up and coming actresses. Wes Craven delivered a great edge of your seat movie, but some scenes the way they are made make you want to laugh. Also Rachel's character is a fighter and stands up for herself unlike some other leading actresses. This is movie worth seeing. Hey, I saw it twice!"
2,2 1/2 stars,"It's OK - just not memorable. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy are fine. The last 15 minutes are laugable, B-movie bad. It's quick, dumb and filled with girl power action."
4,AWESOME MOVIE,"I really like this movie.It was exciting but had just the right amount of comic relief.I was glad that noe one died. (except the bad guys) Colby Donalson was in it, He was the Colby from survivor I thought that was cool."
4,Big Al's review,"This cd definately offers a very nice variaty of songs of the Democratic Republic Congo, the former Zare. All artists are well known and very succesful for years. Some of them performed in Africa, Europe, U.S. and even Japan.There is only one little downside though: half the songs kan be found on other cd's with various artists. So .... check before you buy!"
4,beauty from the warring hellhole of Africa,"As anyone up on the wars going on in the Congo that the West ignores while it chases Osama Bin Laden and WMDs, this area of the world is hell of Earth for so many.The music that comes out of here is quite the opposite--heavenly. Most of it is that jangly African guitar we all expect but this is stuff you can really dance to. Of the lot I'd say Kanda Bongo Man's ""Sai"" is the best but I could have done without the two songs over 10 minutes long on here.Typical Rough Guide with great liner note booklet on the genre and the artists."
5,Creating Private Foundation,"A great great book to give to your existing Private Foundation clients, as well as those considering their options. The book hits on several key points among many others - which are the reason to formalize your investment policy statement(IPS) and donor intent issues. The author is correct that too often good intentions fail to result in effective results. It deals with other vehicles like charitable lead trusts (CLTs) and charitable remainder trusts (CRTs) as well as donor advised and support organizations. It is a big picture book not a technical how to for the attorney!"
4,Albert Einstein: Theoretical Physicist,"Albert Einstein: Theoretical Physicist by Aylesa Forsee is a biography that would appeal to readers of any age. I liked it because it gave more information about Einstein's personality and went into less detail about the science that made him famous. His theories and figures are explained well but kept simple enough so anyone could understand them. The book's not very exciting, but it keeps you coming back to it after every chapter. The book covers many interesting facts of physics and laws of nature that Albert's curiosity and desire to learn brought this knowledge to the world. I would recomend this book to anyone who is interested in Einstein, his discoveries, or the laws of nature."
3,Can't live up to his song selection on Circuit Sessions 1,"Where as Manny Lehman did a dancer's body good with mostly peak anthems on disc 1, volume 4 is more for the crowd who wants to trip out so that boring music will seem more interesting. We're thrown an occasional overplayed diva track-amber, dynamix, sandy B-but they become a shock because they don't fit in with the rest of the filler. But i must give him credit for using the track ""The Ride."" I wish the rest of the CD had lived up to the power of this instrumental hard house track. Track times:1. you see the trouble with me (5:02)2. Love one another (5:54)3. Surrender now (3:25)4. Pitchin (4:24)5. All mixed up (2:54)6. Satisfied (8:12)7. Don't want another man (5:53)8. True (3:57)9. Revenge (3:48)10. Check it out (5:52)11. Mangamania (3:50)12. Definition of tekto (7:22)13. the ride (5:51)14. Cheeky Amanda (4:15)15. Dance 2 da house (3:14)"
1,Seems to have a File Size Limitation,I had mixed results using the PNY Attache 8Gb. Works great as long as files are less than about 100Mb. Large files greater than 100Mb become corrupted for some unknown reason. PNY tech support is not very helpful and down right unbusiness-like as they refuse to answer my emails regarding this apprarent limitation.
2,disapointing,"The outer plastic covering broke after about a week and now it doesn't work at all when i plug it in, which is a real hassle because i had files saved on there that i didn't save anywhere else. get another, more reliable brand."
5,Fantastic!,"SACD, as a format, is a stunning breakthrough in both realism and sonic integrity. This title, though the copy I received from Amazon was Stereo only, (Sony has it listed as a multichannel/stereo disc, and after having spoken to them, I believe there are two versions of this title, Stereo, and a Multichannel/Stereo release), has amazing depth and clarity. Due to the super high sample rate of DSD (The recording process used to create SACD's) the stereo image is dead on, and the realism is phenomenal. Even with a mediocre stereo set up properly, it sounds as if Marvin Gaye is floating in the middle of the sound field. Add to the stereo image a rock solid bottom/bass, tremendous warmth, wonderful dynamics and punch, and glistening silky highs, and you have a winner.Can anyone confirm my multichannel version rumour? If so, I'll buy it again.Hey Sony, don't let this format go the way of the Betacam, ok? It's a winner, if you'll really support it.Just my $0.02."
4,The multichannel is real,"Yes i can confirm this cd comes in multichannel because i own it.If your into the multichannel sacd's and you can find it you won't be dissapointed.This isn't my personal favorite marvin gaye album,I also own a dts greatest hits marvin album which i prefer over this album,But like i mentioned prior if your a marvin fan the multichannel sounds very good."
5,Returning to Holiness,I got the book at a great price compared to the local book stores and the service was fast and efficient!
4,I am Happy.,I live on an island and although my cell phone stinks sometimes with reception. I have not had a bad experience with this product yet! I would definitely recommend this product. My music sounds great in my car (and I would guess that depends on what kind of setup your car has as far as speakers). The only downside was getting the product because it wasn't possible to ship it to the island so I had to wait longer for someone to send it to me.
4,Good product for the right price.,"I bought this product with a mail in rebate for an overall cost of -$[...] with free shipping. I have used other FM transmitters before and this is not the best one on the market, but you get what you pay for. It will definatly do its job and as long as the station is completly static the sound will be clear when the ipod is transmitting to that station. I do like the digital display and the easy to operate buttons. It may be the nature of FM transmitters but it seemed to me that the sound quality of this transmitter was less the others I have used."
4,good product for the price,"For the price, it is very good. Everything is working properly but there is some static noise and the iPod needs to stay in one place. If you move the iPod, the reception is not good at all.I still think this is a good overall deal."
2,Dissapointed,"In my opinion, this product is not worth the price. My wife and I purchased this product with the intention to listen to our ipods in our cars (Yukon and Lexus). We could not find a station that allowed us to listen to the music without static."
3,Worth it's price,"This product works as advertised. The pro is that if you need your car's AC power for something else (like to power your GPS), or if you want to use it on other radios, it is powered by your iPod. I've had it last 5 hours straight from a fully charged iPod, so it doesn't use too much power.The one problem it seems to have is occasional mild bursts of static. Well, that and you can't use it with most iPod cases.All in all though, it's a solid transmitter for its price range, and has some useful features."
3,Only one function works well,"I bought this item from the gold box. When I recieved it, I founhd that only the transmitter worked well. The radio reciever only read the local station, not farther stations. These stations work clearly on a regular radio. You also have to plug the headphones into the port on the bottom of the unit. If you want crystal clear radio, the only option is the Apple Radio Remote."
4,Great Little Device in Irresponsible Packaging,"The Kensington 33169 transmitter performs just as well as the promotional materials promise, and it could not be easier to use. It will turn your iPod into a portable stereo for you and your companions, making it well worth the very affordable price. I would have rated this item at 5 stars, but I was bothered by the over-packaging; the device is sealed in a form-fitting plastic caccoon, top and bottom, inside a box that is at least eight times bigger than the device itself, and the box is shrink-wrapped in more plastic! Terribly wasteful packaging shows an utter lack of environmental ethics, so the folks at Kensington have to take a hit for that."
1,Does Not Work,"I purchased this item thinking it would allow me to receive the FM signals transmitted for the TV's at the gym. It does not pick up any FM signals well, especially the ones I need. I do not recommend this item."
3,Ok but not great.,"I bought the kensington unit more to transmit from my iPod to the car stereo instead of listening to FM. It works quite well for short trips where you can tune to a weak station on your car stereo and match the frequency on the transmitter. It does get static as you travel farther away from the station which really doesn't make sense. I would think the FM transmitter would overpower the antenna but not so. I usually have to tune to a secondary station. Overall, it's a cheap way to get it to play through your stereo. If you have a cassette player in your car, use that instead. My car only has a CD player so it's either this way, headphones or a $400.00 upgrade from my car dealer !!"
2,Sucks. Inconvenient and has a crappy signal.,"This thing works about 65% of the time, but the signal is weak, and it's cumbersome as can be. The itrip is way better."
1,Get what you pay for...,"Thought this was a good deal. Out of the box, the LCD was not displaying all options, and after the first time it locked onto a station, it quit working. Tried resetting to no avail. Back to Amazon it goes, lesson learned."
4,Good Product,"I purchased this transmitter for my fiance for Christmas and he seems to enjoy it! I think he enjoys it because he can play the music he wants to hear with out skipping through one CD just to hear one or two songs, or having to deal with the radio stations when they just play the same songs over and over. The only down side I see to this product is that you can't turn the volume up loud as you want. Some songs play louder than others. But over all, its a good product."
4,Works better than itrip,"I used to have an iTrip with my 60 gig photo iPod, which worked decently, but once I purchased the new 80 gig video iPod, I had to purchase a new iTrip, to my dissatisfaction, the iTrip didn't work well, it didn't even power on most of the time. But, this product works flawlessly as a transmitter, and with little problems as a radio. The product uses your headphones as an antenna, so the better your headphones, the better the signal the product will receive."
4,Hands down the best FM transmitter I have owned,"This is the best I have found so far... I have used the Belkin F8V3080 TuneCast II, and I needed to hold it in my hand to get any kind of reception...not exactly conveniendt when driving. This unit works much better, especially out of the city, where I find the reception to be much stronger."
4,Works great,"Maybe the folks who didn't like it got a bad batch, or maybe I just got the good batch, but I'm lovin' this little thing. The transmitter is solid up to about 30 feet and sounds just like playing a CD. The radio receiver is solid, but typically best on the strongest stations in an area (what do you expect with no external antenna and low power needs??). I bought it as a deal of the day and think that was the perfect price. The $40 is a bit steep, but if it comes down from there it's worth it."
2,Kensington Radio for IPod,The reception was terrible. The lack of instructions or understandable instructions prohibited my usage of the device for several days until I could find someone who could help me.
1,kensington digital fm raido transmitter for ipods,"I would have never purchased this item had I known that the transmitter is very week and the signal on my radio would go in and out. Don't buy this product! At best, you can hear only the most powerful radio stations that broadcast the highest wattage."
4,Inexpensive and works well,Performs as advertised and is much less expensive than alternatives. Got one for each of my kids.
3,Meh,"This product is just OK. The buttons do not really work that well and the reception is not all that great. But, what do you really want it to do for only 10 bucks?!?!?!"
2,Discontinued item,Was dead on arrival. Tech Support was very helpful & replaced with the current version promptly.
4,Very useful,"I love this item, I don't have to drag around my cds or try to tape my radio programs or carry around my big cd/tape/radio around anymore. I put everything on my ipod, hook up the transmitter, use any radio that's available at work or friend's homes. Only thing that's a bother is you can't recharge and use at the same time."
2,"weak transmitter, falls out easily","If you have a case for your iPod, as most people who care to protect their valuables does, it is nearly impossible to use this product. Why do the designers of these things always assume you want it to protrude rigidly from your iPod? A cable option would be nice! It does work fairly well as a receiever though, so I gave it 2 stars."
2,"Bad transmitter, excellente receiver","I live an a big city with a lot of broadcast radio stations with high power, and my route to go to my work include great electrical plants. For this reason have a lot of interference practically in any part of my transit time. The FM revceiver is excellent, I can hear FM statiosn in my office very well. I f you plan to use like transmitter I don't recommend. I you want to use like FM receiver is perfect."
1,Do not buy !!!!,It drains out all the power from the ipod within minutes ... pls don't buy ... totally useless product ... if you want you can take from me for free ....
1,Useless,"I tried to use this at my gym to pick up the fm stations that were tied into their tv system. It picked up the stations, but there was constant static. When will I learn that none of these portable transmitters/receivers will ever work with clarity!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"This transmitter was awful. It would stop working periodically and when it did work it was very weak. It broke completely after two months of use. Also, the iPod cannot be charged while this thing is plugged in. After mine broke, I switched to a transmitter that plugs into a car cigarette lighter--I would highly recommend that kind over this one."
3,"Kensington 33169 Digital FM Radio and Transmitter for iPods--Well, at best is so so!","Kensington 33169 is at best so so. If you leave in an area with a lot of FM station, you are better off hard wiring the iPod into your radio. When it works, the quality of sound is ok!"
3,ipod fm radio,works ok. range is low and some feed back noted on transmitting signal. does receive fm stations ok. priced right for what it does.
4,I like it,"I only use this in my local gym to watch tv while exercising and it does exactly what I want it to do. Clear sound,easy operation, inexpensive, low battery draw. What's not to like? It is not able to easily differentiate local radio from the interference inside the building but that is likely true of more expensive radios as well. For me it's worth the cost regardless of the transmitter. Good job Kensington."
2,An Ok Product,"The Kensington Digital Transmitter is at best a mediocre product. It does it's job barley. It is a battery hog that really doesn't overpower the static on many channels. It takes up the interface port at the bottom and then doesn't have a charger port so you can plug in your car charger into it (Which would have alleviated the battery problem). If it's on sale (which it was for me, I got it for 10 dollars) it would be an ok pick up if you REALLY needed an FM transmitter for your iPod."
3,Decent Product,"It's easy to use and it works well in SOME cars. In my old car, it worked poorly. The quality and signal were very weak, so I stopped using it completely in that car. In my new car, it works almost flawlessly. I think anyone who buys this product is taking a risk, there's no guarantee it will work well on your car. More than likely, if you have a newer model car, it's going to work but it's still a risk."
4,beter than most,I have had 2 other transmitters and this is the only one that has worked consistently.
2,Kensington 33169 Digital FM Radio and Transmitter for iPods,"Got this on sale for [...]. It works but it is difficult to get great reception in cities if you are using it to transmit to your car radio. I occasionally use the FM radio functionality. It has pretty good reception, but I usually just listen to a play list. This type of thing is great in theory, but most of the people I know who have these types of things always seem to use them a couple of times then leave them in the glove box until the next road trip. I would advise most people to use the cost of this to get a car stereo with an ""audio in"" jack, or true Ipod/Car integration. That is a much less aggravating solution to getting Mr. Ipod to play nice with Mr. Car Radio. It does run off the battery of the Ipod, and it suck power at a very fast rate, so keep that in mind before leaving on a 6 hour car ride. You will most liekely be listening to local Country stations after your battery has gone dead."
3,"It works, but.....","I do like this item, but I get irritated with it easily. First of all, it has to stay close to the radio or you loose the transmission. You have to find the right station too, or it will be fuzzy when the music is playing. What I think bothers me the most about it is that if I loose the transmission, the transmitter turns off, and I have to unplug it from my I-Pod for it to turn back on. This is all a little much when you are trying to drive safely. I don't know, maybe mine has a problem, but it makes listening to my I-pod in the car less enjoyable. If you can get it on a great sale or free, it is worth is, but I wouldn't spend more the $25 bucks for it."
5,great product,"this radio transmitter is really good-YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND A NOT SO CLEAR RADIO SIGNAL SO ITS EASIER TO TRANSMIT. The only downside is that you have to keep the ipod close to the sterio that ur transmitting too. otherwise, the signal gets to weak and the ipod wont be able to overide the radio station-just keep out of reach of pets!"
5,Has Worked Great for Over Two Years!,"I bought this transmitter two years ago after getting frustrated with a bulky cradle transmitter that had to plug into my cig lighter. After using this Kensington model, I don't know why they even make other kinds!!It works fabulously. No wires, no cradles; just snap it on, find a static channel, and I'm done. In my experience it ""holds on"" to blank channels a lot longer than other transmitters, so I have to switch channels less. (I use it driving from Central Texas to Louisiana and back - not a short trip, with a lot of radio stations in between.)I do wish it could charge my iPod, but for the simplicity and ease of being wireless I don't mind giving that up."
3,"Quick battery use, average signal",This works. Bottom line. But battery is drained quickly and the signal fades sometimes as well.I would suggest this as an entry level item.
3,Inconsistent Transmission,"I got mine with my IPOD and is really interested in playing my tunes through the car stereo instead of using a cassette adapter. But this thing is not consistent and you just don't know when it will or will not work. It sometimes lock into the station 88.1 smoothly, at other times, forget about it --- this can get you frustrated! So you don't want to play with this when you're driving. To use as a receiver is great! so I give it 3 stars."
3,Works good but get the other versions....,"I bought this because it came cheap with my iPod (which I love). I like it and it comes in handy when entertaining at home because I can just hook it up to the iPod, tune the stereo in and listen without having to buy an expensive speaker unit for the iPod.That's the good news...the bad news is that you can't use this unit if your iPod is in a case (and why own an iPod if you aren't going to put it in a case!!!).If you are going to use this in your car, GET ANOTHER PRODUCT! You want something in the car that will also charge your iPod battery. This won't do that."
4,Great buy! Works better than the others!,"I tried a few other FM transmitter devices, only to return them after disappointing results. Found this one on Amazon and have been impressed from the moment I took it out of the box! You can set it to transmit on any FM frequency and it has four presets to lock and load the best reception. Now I can listen to my iPod with ease while commuting from the north end all the through to the south end of Minneapolis."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"I ordered this product a few weeks ago and it works great. It's powered by the iPod itself and produces a good signal for your car (or home) stereo to receive. It can be challenging (especially in a big metro area like Denver) to find an FM frequency without interference from broadcast stations. I found one, and it generally works well, although there is some minor interference from power lines.It also works well for receiving FM in the gym I go to. I've had no issues listening to them.My wife likes it enough that I just ordered a second one for her. It's not a perfect product (hence 4-stars), but it's very functional and comes at a great price."
1,This product does not work,This product is horrible. now i have figure out how to return it to Amazon.
1,poor performance,the transmitter deemed ineffectual as the station used had plenty of background static mixed in with the music. the result was poor. very disappointed. I do not recommend this product.
1,bad bad product,"It took a few attempts to make it work, and when it finally did, the reception was quite poor.However, after 3 weeks it stopped transmitting and became useless.You get what you pay for. Get a better one!"
2,FM! Not FM Stereo,"It's not the products fault, it's my fault. I was so caught up in the moment of purchasing my first Ipod, I took it for granted it was stereo. FM Transmitter hits a Double, my new Ipod (80 gigs) hits a Grand Slam. Thanks Amazon."
3,great idea not so great of construction,"The grip is comfortable i'll give it that, and its a strong grip. But the rubber finger groove inserts do not fit as tight as they should.... it looks like it is going to come out at the top. Also the insert cap on the bottom of the grip is hard to get out and rattles so i just removed it. I wanted to try this grip because i have bigger hands and wanted a wider grip, so i bought this instead of the hogue grip which is a little bit smaller.....Bottom line go with hogue ... i should have"
3,OK -- but nothing really new here ...,"This would be good for a student having to get some quick notes on the play. However, I am a local actor and purchased this in the hope that I might be able to get a few ideas from the notes for my interpretation of the character I was playing (Sen. Brady). There really isn't anything new here that isn't already in all of the other items like this (Cliff Notes, etc.).Instant downloading is a plus, however."
5,Inspirational and moving,"This book illustrates how a skillful practitioner and an artful teacher can make a difference in a child's life. It shows why our traditional methods of consequences and punishments, of making demands and rejecting children who don't live up to them create and maintain our hostile educational systems thus our society. Goertz demonstrates another way; a path toward healing and peace. She strengthed my resolve that respect, community and time are the way and that some children are on a unique journey.It should be a must read for every teacher, especially teachers of young children.Children Who Are Not Yet Peaceful: Preventing Exclusion in the Early Elementary ClassroomLaurie Prusso M.Ed.Professor of Child DevelopmentModesto Junior CollegeModesto, CA"
3,Connector compatibility issue,"It would have been nice if this had come with a tape and a couple of BNC/RCA adapters, so I could have used it right out of the box instead of having to make a 30 mile round trip to find a tape. Then I still had to wait because the adapters had to be ordered online (the Lorex uses BNC while I had only RCA type). The specs for this product weren't very clear on some things like connectors and compatibility, even at the Lorex website. Other than that, it works fine. I caught a pair of raccoon hooligans on camera, and a neighbor dog stealing my cat's food, and even the dish!! With the Lorex recorder, I am using an Astek night vision wireless cam and an older TV with only an RCA connection in the back (had to get an RF modulator to complete the connection between those two)."
1,Saved My Boats Life!,"I was ready to just scrap out my boat for junk. Instead I invested a few last resort dollars in this manual and it turned my Mercury from a hard starting, rough running, not to dependable motor into a motor that starts well and runs much better. I am able to take my grandkids fishing again with no concerns for their safety!"
4,A worthy tribute and tome in its own right,"A facinating journey of physicists, molecular biologists, geneticists, etc. trying to capture the power of speculation as Erwin Schroedinger did 50 years earlier. Fans of Steven J. Gould will find the (sometimes contrary) opinions of other learned men of science equally stimulating as his own chapter."
3,Stitching not so great...,"For the price and all the great reviews, I am surprised at the problematic stitching where the panels meet. They don't match up exactly. Not enough to send the globe back, but disappointing just the same."
2,Made in China :-(,"Imagine my dismay when I received my ""Hugg-a-Planet"" and saw the ""Made in China"" tag! A Vermont-based company making a product called ""Hugg a Planet"" and it's made by workers with no rights and shipped halfway around the world in an ocean container. Just doesn't seem right.The toy is educational and quality seems okay, so if you're looking for a toy that pretends to love the Earth without actually loving the Earth, then this one's for you."
2,Bland,"I did not believe the story of the characters at all, neither was well developed. The author also tried to go down the path of the ""dark, brooding"" lead that will alone save the world and he did not pull it off. I also did not like some of the writing; I found it a bit forced or dry. Not much between the covers. Sure the story sounds interesting, but somehow that does not translate to what is actually written. Overall, this is not that great of a book. There are many others out there that are better."
5,A Fantastic Story,"This was a fantastic story! The plot was able to change with little hints. This book like many of Jack Higgins' are great at charcter build up. It will make you want to keep reading till the very end. I would like to quote Tom Clancy, ""JACK HIGGINS IS THE MASTER."""
3,Higgins As Usual!,"This Higgins book has a female assassin who uses a motorcycleas her means of helping with her killings. In real life ourmaster assassin is Grace Browning an actress. She is in the services of a group called September 30. Their goal is to use the assassinations to create chaos and install a Communist state.Her superior is an old KGB agent who is on Prime Minister John Major's staff. Of course it falls on our hero Sean Dillon to stop this group. He comes through as usual.While this is aninteresting book it is no where close to the caliber of ""Eye ofThe Storm""."
4,A challenging thriller,This thriller is a grabber! Higgins is in top- form. I give this book 4 stars out of five because it went a little slower to read than his others. Still packs a wallop. He just gets better.
2,grrrrr,"This book became boring after the first 20 pages. Then it got interesting for a while and then boring again. Ups and downs, over and over again. Like other readers said - the story is rather ridiculous, the characters lack in depth. Some characters are not only not impressive in any way - it would be better if they were not a part of this book at all. This could be a good book - unfortunately Higgins did not take well to researching the topic in any way, apparently."
2,The last Jack Higgins book I will ever read,"My expectations of the quality of Jack Higgins' novels have diminished to the point where I will never buy another one of his recycled hack-works. I happened to read Solo, an excellent short novel with spare writing and interesting plot twists, just before I read Angel of Death. A mistake that cost me any enjoyment that I could have taken from this book. Why? The similarities in the final scene are so obvious as to prove that Jack has lost what imagination he has left and is writing strictly for the money."
1,"Really, Really Bad. An Unbelievable Piece Of Fiction.","This is a relatively old book I came across, but thank goodness for that. The story has characters that you would have to force yourself to believe are in any sense of the word, real. Gun toting female actresses; an MP who is an assassin and homosexual and GRU and with a friend who is a professor, homosexual, Russian lover, GRU, with a plot that might meet the expectations of the illiterate. The author's knowledge of weapons seems to be something he gleened from the internet. A waste of time. The author's reputation has dropped with this book."
2,Sean Dillon is just too good to be true...,"Angel of Death is a lightweight entry into the political thriller field. The biggest problem I had with this book is that the characters were just too cool to be believable. Everyone was so polished, talented, cool in a crisis, and glib that they made James Bond look like a geek. It was mildly entertaining, but once I finished the last page of the book, there was nothing to react to, nothing to digest, nothing to reflect on.."
1,Dont waste your money!,All three movies cut out almost every other word. I didn't know it was from the 80's or i wouldn't have wasted my time.
3,not a big fan,being an adult i did not like any of the episodes..but i can say my children loved them and want to be watching them.i got upset when i found out wal-mart had a better price.
5,A Must for Hello Kitty Lovers,"I got this for my 3yr old neice. She was so excited that she could watch Hello Kitty whenever she wants to. Talk about making someone happy, this certanly did."
3,Warning: double-sided DVD,"The Hello Kitty cartoons are among my daughters' favorites! And why the ""Cat Wars"" parody isn't considered one of the great Star Wars Parodies Of All Time is something I will never understand.But I made a mistake in buying this three-pack. Two of the disks in the triple pack are actually a two-sided DVD. For an adult Hello Kitty collector, that would be fine; but if you have a three-year-old who is prone to scratching disks up, this doubles the chance of destroying the movie.Spend the extra couple of dollars to buy individual DVDs.Five stars for the content; 1 star for the disks."
3,Ran out of Gas,"Great work on the early years, but I was not impressed with the later years. Seems like the author simply ran out of gas."
4,An Important Distinction,A thoroughly interesting view of the difference between fortune-telling and divination and why the first is condemned but the second lauded in the Bible. We all should learn a little divination so our path through this world can be more determined.
5,Doc Watson is the best!!,"If you love bluegrass guitar playing, these instrumentals from Doc Watson are iconic. He is truly the master among so many great pickers. Each track is great, but ""June Apple"" is, perhaps, the most incredible guitar instrumental I have ever heard. A great American, and we will miss him."
2,"I'd like to say I love this, but...","Several of the pieces are quite good, but there are other Native flute players out there I like much more. Miller's playing is very simple and straightforward, and sometimes, as in the title track, monotonous. His tone is very breathy, almost creaky in spots -- nothing like the richness of Mary Youngblood or the complexity of Kevin Locke. The pieces in which Miller pairs his flute with guitar I find to be stronger than the solo pieces. If you want to hear solo flute, listen to Kevin Locke's ""Dream Catcher"", Robert Tree Cody's ""Dreams from the Grandfather"", or Mary Youngblood's ""The Offering"". If you are interested in Native flute in an ensemble setting, with guitars, drums, and voice, then listen to Mary Youngblood's second album, ""Heart of the World"" for acoustic music, or Robert Mirabal's ""Taos Tales"" for more electric sounds. Miller, like the rest of these artists, doesn't smother his flutes with layers of synthesizer goop, and that's a Good Thing (tm)."
3,Liked it,I really liked the music and the different types of Klezmer music on this CD is fun and up beat. It is good to listen to as you are getting ready for work.
4,An introduction to Greek mythology.,"This volume by the transplanted Irish poet Padraic Colum is a well-known introduction to Greek mythology for children. It was a runner-up to the first (1922) Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. In the framework of telling the story of Jason and the Argonauts, other noted stories are told (e.g., Theseus and the Minotaur, the labors of Hercules, etc.). In this edition, the artwork is in the style of the 1920s. You can even imagine ""flappers"" dancing. Children enjoy this introduction and search for more."
2,The Golden Fleece and the Heroes Who Lived Before Achilles,"I've taught 6th grade for more than a decade so I'm quite familiar with the Greek heroes. That's why I was so disappointed to discover that this is one of the most boring versions of the Greek myths I've ever read. Perhaps in 1922, when it was new, it excited children to research further, but modern kids find the language stulted and the action almost non-existent. Far better versions of these stories exist. Unfortunately for me, taken in by good reviews, I bought twenty copies for classroom use before discovering how deadly dull it was. If you have a kid whose read everything else, s/he might be interested, otherwise just forget it."
3,the golden fleece,"I think that the golden fleece was a great book and had great illistrations,and detail in the story a few places are a little rough but still a great book. It whould be a little better if it did'int keep skiping story's"
5,Jason must prove his worth by embarking on a journey for a legendary fleece,"This classic title appears in the Looking Glass Library, presenting a fine hardcover reprint in an edition perfect for library lending. Padraic Colum's THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND THE HEROES WHO LIVED BEFORE ACHILLES receives a fine introduction by Rick Riordan in a survey bringing young adults to ancient Greece, where Jason must prove his worth by embarking on a journey for a legendary fleece."
2,Pretty bad actually!,"I read this book cover to cover. There was not one good play in the bunch. The playwright does have a gift for storytelling but not for drama. The Weir, the first play in the book is the only one where there is dialogue. The other five plays are all monologues. Mcpherson tells stories very well but that doesnt cut it. The subject matter is repulsively discusting. Every character is a drunk. I mean a REAL drunk. If you could go through the plays and do an inventory on the alcohol consumed, you could fill a LARGE pool. Another popular liquid with Mcpherson is puke. His character are constantly throwing up all over everywhere. I really could not get into this work."
2,I liked the poster... :),"I was in NYC over the summer and saw the poster for some show called ""The Weir."" Gee, I thought, what an awesome poster! I have to at least read the play! So I did... well, tried. What may be fantastic on stage is nothing but a jumbling of words on page. I couldn't get more than 20 pages into the book before I retired it. The language was easy enough to understund (I lived in Ireland for almost 15 years) but the story itself (on page) was lacking. It seems as though all the previous reviewers saw the show and did not read the text (or saw the show then read it); my recommendation is to do the latter, maybe then you'll be able to digest this play.P.S. Maybe you should down a few guiness before you read, that may get you in more of an Irish mood. :)P.P.S. I'm giving the play two stars just because I didn't truly finish reading; Hey, maybe it gets better at the end! Too bad I'm not that patient :)"
4,A great play,"Annoyed though I am, as a young Irish playwright, to admit it, Conor McPherson's The Weir is the best Irish play of the Nineties. It's sharply observed (I love the jostling for position that the men do in the presence of the young woman), beautifully written - McPherson can make even ordering a drink into a loaded moment - and it's a gift to actors. His other work, generally in monologue form, is in my opinion less successful, but that's more due to the contradictory and frustrating nature of the form than the line-to-line quality of the writing, which is never less than excellent. Question is, how in the world does he make it look so easy?"
1,Broke within 6 months,"Ordered in October. Broke on Feb 23, six months later. The one pin that plugs into the wall came loose and pulled out of the plastic box. It is now connected to a wire hanging out of the plastic. I'm afraid to plug it in. I rarely unplug from the wall. This week I was traveling so plugged in/out of wall socket everyday. So I spend $3 for 6 months of use. I probably should have popped for the br $15 brand name cord. The one that came with my phone lasted for years. Oh well, you live and your learn."
3,"Not great, but helpful","Out of 30 promised pages only 12 are actual text, the rest is intro, table of context etc. The text, however, is helpful in preparing for presentation or writing a paper on Dutchman. If you are working on this play, e-mail me. I'll be happy to help, as I have a lot of material on it."
5,Castlevania,The only thing I have to say!! It's a good game I already played it and this is better than the other castlevania!! buy it and tell me later if you like it!
2,Portrait of Disappointment,"A disappointing outing for the Castlevania franchise, especially considering Dawn of Sorrow's more or less excellent offering. While the initial premise brings to mind far superior entries such as the classic Dracula X or Legacy of Darkness, this pales in comparison to those and, even more insultingly, taints the characters from a previous entry, Bloodlines, with their insulting inclusion in this extremely lacking and excessively dull Castlevania. While graphically superb and good sound-wise for the most part, pretty pictures and good music (with mostly good voice acting) do not excuse the terrible story, lacking gameplay, and outright frustrating attempts at accommodating the gimmicky insertions. After a point in the extremely predictable and groan-worthy story, I put it down permanently. Save your money and buy something more deserving of it instead."
5,if you like castlevania SOTN or dawn of sorrow...,"you will love this. just like symphony of the night & dawn of sorrow (and apparently aria of sorrow but never played that) -- it's a blast. lots of sidequests & secrets, it uses the same levelling up system & map systems of the others, but there are warp rooms to different areas, too. so while the main castle isn't as big as in dawn of sorrow, the game area is actually bigger. totally awesome purchase for ds, makes my daily train rides go by so fast."
4,Good Game overall,This caslevania game is a good game to own. its rather long. (which is a good thing) and it has a lot of secrets and hidden things. Also the ability to play through again after beating with different characters or the same characters with almost all your old stuff is great as well. The downside to this game is the replay value wasnt that good. i just didnt feel like picking it back up after i beat it. overall though a great game to play!!
3,"Pretty generic in gameplay, rather disappointing graphics","CPR, as this game has come to be known, is, frankly speaking, a generic game in the Castlevania series. I'm glad I played it as a rental instead of shelling out $30 of good money for it. The storyline is both nondescript and nonexistent, and the game plays straightforwardly. The graphics, like other Castlevania games, is rather poor, little improved over the old GBA versions. Overall it makes a worthwhile play for hardcore Castlevania fans -- and Amazon's super-low price is a big help."
5,Phenomenal 2D platformer with RPG elements.,"This is a great game that allows for plenty of customization.Jonathan's numerous weapons are varied in attack power, range, and speed. His secondary ability, typically use of thrown weapons, also depends on the player's selection. Though Charlotte's weapons offer much less variety, her spells are diverse and powerful. Characters may be swapped on the fly, and both can be used at once (with the decent AI controlling the second character).Characters become stronger as they gain experience and level up, so even if the player gets stuck at a boss, (s)he can grind for a level or two and try again.Level design and enemy design are superb.Unfortunately, the game is pretty linear. Although all explored areas may be revisited easily (through waypoints), most unexplored areas will be blocked off until specific abilities are gained."
4,Some re-playability,"where to start, the heart of the game with johnathan and charlotte has enough secret areas to explore without getting dull. theres also enough unlockable characters for replayability, and this is where the game really becomes challenging. using richter and maria which are unable to use potions or the desimating magic attacks of charlotte only adds to that challenge.personally i like using richter and maria far more then the intended characters, if only for the added diffaculty.this game is quite a blast, with an excellent, and beautifully told story.portrait of ruin may not be another symphony of the night (PS1) but it is a wonderful addition to the castlevania series, and a deffinate must get."
2,Hate it,"Cost to much money. Not very sturdy. First one was broken and had to send it back to the company. (That was very easy. I give the company ***** 5 stars for how easy it was to exchange it.) However, I would not buy this desk again."
1,Horrible.,This series is full of canned laugh tracks. Dreadful. Not funny.I would not recommend this one at all. Boring to boot.
5,I've swallowed the Little Book of Calm!!,"Definitly one of the greatest television shows I've ever seen; it's absolutely to die for. Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey are amazing and together, they're even better. I'd go so far as to say that they're one of the best comic duos of all time, they play off of eachother excellently. It's a pity more people in the States haven't even heard of Black Books."
4,A fascinating account of African hunting and game control,"If you are curious about what the last of the commercial hunting of elephants was like in the early years of the twentieth century, this is an excellent book. An autobiography as told to a professional writer, this text is extremely valuable in showing the real world risks and rewards faced by George Rushby as he sought adventure, found it, and went on to become a professional game warden. While not as action packed as a novel could be, it is hard to imagine a more adventurous life, unless it was the early hunters that colonized the new world. Recommended for real life adventurers (the sections on ""dash"" are worth the price of the book) and Walter Mittys as well."
5,A review of Spyro Gyra's Carnaval.,"Carnaval is fantastic collection of songs released by Spyro Gyra. The album was originally released in 1980, the start of their golden years. The cd itself is great. All of the songs are a pleasure to listen to, and have appropriate names for the tracks. Horn parts are an integral part of this record.My top 3 favorite songs from this cd would be 1,2, and 4. Cafe Amore has an overall excellent tone and has a very nice guitar solo featured in it. Dizzy has a unique/interesting melody to it, and the guitar, bass, and horn parts of the song are fantastic. Cachaca has a memorable melody and closes with a ripping guitar solo. Every other track is good as well.All in all, this is a very nice album released by Spyro Gyra. It's vintage, man. It's well worth the purchase and you won't regret it, either. Thank you for taking the time and generosity to read my review."
5,Fantástico cd!!!,"Este cd es realmente fantástico. Jay Beckenstein como lider del grupo sabe transmitir la emoción y la fantasía en cada una de sus improvisaciones junto con el nivel maravilloso de su grupo. Excelente sonido analógico de la grabación. Destacan los temas: DIZZY, CASHACA, SWEET AND SAVVY y CARNAVAL. Todo el cd ya es un clásico del jazz.Muy recomendable!!!"
4,Spyro Gyra Goes to Rio,"Carnaval is a good example of what made Spyro Gyra one of the of the most popular jazz fusion acts and why they had such cross over success on the pop charts. The melodies are appealing and the tropical atmosphere is undeniable. Carnaval came out in 1980 between Morning Dance and Catching the Sun, but one thing that distinguishes Carnaval is is specific references to Brazil and the Carnaval festival. But this in not close to being travel log disc. The music remains the eclectic mix of tropical themed fusion and popular funk that was so successful for Spyro Gyra during this period. The sound and melodies are clear and clean, and so is the fun."
4,Dizzy,I found this particular title to be elating. This is one of the foundation tunes Spyro Gyro built their future and popularity on.
4,Goji-Dynamic Labs,"Not quite as tasty as the more expensive one by that famous Dr. What's-His-Name but has the same effects. Re: the review claiming it contained pear juice,..all of the Goji juice brands are blended with other juices. The only way to get 100% pure juice is to purchase the goiji berries themselves and use a juicer."
4,"Do Work, Son! Streets!","I'm pretty sure that MTV wasn't targeting this show or DVD series to suburban housewives, but that's what I am - in addition to being a huge Rob & Big fan. The DVD interviews and extras really support what I already suspected - that Rob and Chris have a deep friendship that goes beyond roomates or employer/employee. I espcially love the ""Meaty Reel"" that just shows highlights of his growth from little pup to full-grown Meat Bag. Skaters may enjoy Rob's tutorials at the end of each disc, but my favorite feature is finally being able to hear the full dialogue without all the annoying FCC beeps. These guys are just fun and funny to watch, and the episodes don't get old after multiple viewings. This DVD set is a great deal for the money, so Do Work and get to it."
4,better than on tv,"If you liked the show on tv, you will love the dvd. Its twice as funny because nothing is sensored."
5,MTV FINALLY DOES SOMETHING WORTHWHILE!,"I always thought MTV was worthless until I caught an episode of Rob & Big at a friend's house. Now, I am hooked! I can't get enough and watch the reruns over and over and have even downloaded onto my IPOD! This show is great because it is funny, clean, down to earth, sincere, and realistic. I highly recommend!!!"
4,"5 stars for the cable, -1 for the misleading product description","This is a good cable, looks pretty much as shown in the pictures. Works perfectly fine, connected it to my external Firewire drive to my Macbook Pro.But I'm subtracting one star for what I believe is a misleading/incorrect product description. Cable came packaged in a clear plastic bag with no labels. Is this a Tripp Lite part? No idea."
1,They are Lying,The cable is advertised as a Tripp Lite. What you will actually receive is a knock off in a generic bag. I should have gotten the hint; the manufacturer of the advertised product issued a warning about fake cables and posted a picture of what the legitimate package looks like. Haven't even tried it. I don't like being lied to. RETURN.
4,Well worth it.,What more can I say but the price can't be beat. Excellent product and just as described. I recommend using this for your television system needs.
1,doesn't work,My cable just came in the mail yesterday and I went to use it for my Presonus firestudio mobile but it didn't work. I connected the 800 part into my Macbook pro and the 400 end into my interface and it didn't connect at all. I don't know what the problem is but it's very unfortunate.
1,DOES NOT WORK...,"I just received this cable in the mail yesterday. I tried to use it today. As soon as I insert the 6-pin side into the port, it is immediately ejected. There is nothing wrong with the port, as I checked it with a 6-pin to 6-pin cable. Both sides of that cable stay in the port just fine. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,Works as advertized,"It works, Its cheap, It is too long and stiff.Wish it comes in a shorter length and a thinner cable. 3 stars."
3,Be Careful,"We bought an iMac, and it doesn't have a Firewire 400 port, just a Firewire 800 port. We have a camcorder with Firewire 400 output. So I needed an adapter. I bought this cable, and when it came I realized that while one end will fit into the Firewire 800 port on the computer, the other end doesn't fit into the camcorder. So, I paid for shipping both ways. Then I bought an adapter plug that goes into the back of the computer, and I use my existing camcorder Firewire cord and plug it into the adapter, and that works great. Before buying this adapter cable, make sure you wouldn't be better off with an adapter plug."
1,This was supposed to be a Tripp Lite cable...,"This did not arrive in a Tripp Lite-branded bag, despite the assurance on this product page According to the blurb on this page, I should not accept this, as it appears to be a substitute. The FW400 connector is NOT gold-plated as in the photo on this page, nor do the molded plastic connector housings look like those on the pictured Tripp Lite cable. This impostor cable was sold by MarginMart: caveat emptor, and Amazon please clean up your ""Marketplace."""
5,Great cable at a great price,"Cable looks nice, works well and was priced right.What else could you ask for??"
4,My cat's breath smells like cat food!,"The terminal end works great, but the proximal plug is a little loose in a macbook pro. Being a DJ, it gets moved around a lot but it's never wiggled enough to lose signal so definitely a wise purchase compared to other bulky adapters."
4,its a cable,Does what is stated. Rugged construction and sends/receives audio as I expected it to. Definitely would purchase again if necessary
1,False Advertising & Overt Deception in Product Description,"The ultimate in false advertising. In the product description on Amazon, Tripp Lite describes this item as: Firewire 800 ""Gold"" Hi-speed cable. Tripp Lite includes a picture of the cable with a GOLD connector (gold connectors are more expensive). BUT, Tripp Lite does not send a gold cable when you purchase this item. This is not an isolated incident. Other reviewers have complained about ordering this product and only receiving the standard cable, instead of the higher-quality gold cable. Better to purchase a gold cable from Radio Shack or some other reliable retailer. Do not trust this seller... unless you are OK with bait and switch advertising."
4,Must have for MacBook Pro users,"I purchased my MacBook Pro and installed Logic Express on it, but i needed a cable or adapter to plug in my Presonus Firebox interface. The firebox has a firewire 400 port, and the MacBook Pro has the 800 port, so this cable is just what I needed. It works well and is pretty fast. The only complaint I have is the cable is a little stiff and fits somewhat loosely into the 800 port. You can wiggle it around in the 800 port, but it's snug enough to not come out if you don't mess with it. Overall, great product for the price."
3,"Cheap cable. Functions, but for how long?","This cable was inexpensive but disappointing. It does function connecting a FW 800 computer port to a FW 400 device, but there is no visible ""gold"" in this cable. The 400FW end is metallic, but not gold-plated. The 800FW end is mostly plastic and fits poorly in my Macbook Pro. Probably best to try a better cable. The cable itself is thick and fairly flexible."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I should have listened to the inner voice saying that when you skimp on electronics, you get what you pay for. This cable simply does not work. I am returning it and upgrading to a Belkin. Don't waste your time ordering this cable."
3,"Enough, but too late","This book is something I wish I had bought when it was published in early 1998. Now, in the year 2000, I'm not so sure. It talks about level 4 browsers as state of the art. It's got a lot of info, but not up to date at all. In a world that changes radically every few months, this book is like ancient history. I'll not return it because there may be some tidbits in there that I can use some day and I like to have a fairly complete library if I can. It's WAY overdue for an update--which I'll probably buy if and when they publish it. Of course, it's totally my fault for not checking the publishing date which is in large type on the listing for the book."
5,Kudos to Christopher for a great head start !!,"I think the author realizes that no ""one book"" can prepare you for webmastering ... but this one is AWFULLY close !! I'm not going to fault Mr. Ditto for the somewhat misleading title (although all ""Answers"" Series books have been excellent), but I give him a mighty THUMBS-UP for a WONDERFUL first step !! At no time does the author expect that 25 pages of JavaScript how-to tips will prepare the reader for all JS disasters; but perhaps anyone who would think this shouldn't consider being a webmaster. I can honestly say that while glossing through this book, I found AT LEAST a dozen solutions I could have used about six months ago ... and a DOZEN is NO exaggeration !!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This software would not install on to my computer. The manufacturer would not even respond to an email that asked for help to resolve the problem. I've tossed the CD in the back of my closet, because I'll have to consider it a learning experience since I can't return software. If Amazon doesn't provide better screening of the products they sell, they will be tossed aside as well!"
2,NOT VERY GOOD,"THE ANIMATED CHESS BOARD IS COOL, BUT I PREFER PLAYING WITH REGULAR PIECES. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH REGULAR PIECES, THE GAME MOVES VERY SLOWLY. THE GAMEPLAY IN BETWEEN CHESS MATCHES IS TIME CONSUMING AND BORING. THE GRAPHICS ARE GOOD, BUT THERE AREN'T VERY MANY CHOICES OF BOARDS OR PIECES."
3,I like this game but it keeps on freezing,I like the game but somehow when I do Battle Mode the game keeps freezing. Could I have a replacement?
2,no 3 Move Draw,"I really liked this game until I came upon a position where I had made a mistake and I could only repeat moves.After three times repeating the position it should recognize the Draw.Needless to say, it did not, so after about 10 tries I finally gave up.Bottom line a chess game must follow the rules otherwise it is not a chess game."
4,A worthy addition to my PSP library,"I am not a seasoned chess player, but I do enjoy playing the game. Online Chess Kingdoms is an excellent way to learn and practice strategies. I appreciate the fact that it has varying levels of difficulty; I win often enough that I don't get frustrated with playing, but I lose just enough to make it a challenge. I think that the animated chess pieces are a nice touch and I like the added content of the battle map. Overall, it is a worthy addition to my PSP library, and I recommend it to anyone that find chess remotely interesting."
3,"Incredible, but flawed.","This is the most exciting chess game on any platform because of the animations. Level 4 (Master), plays excellent chess. Chess sets are very creative with distint music.However, there are issues. 1) After the same position repeats 3 times, the game doesn't draw. Because of this, the computer is willing to play the same position back and forth forever, so you must play a weaker position or quit the game. 2) Level 1 - 3 is very easy to beat; the AI gives pieces away, but then level 4, becomes imposible, playing highly rated chess. So, it's hard to find an intermediate AI playing level. 3) The 2D chess set is a dull black and white, but easy to read while the animated 3D sets are indredible, but difficult to read. 4) Don't expect to find any opponents online.This game needs a second version to fix the issues. If so, it'd be a great game for the TV platforms also."
4,another chess game,"The graphics and sound are first rate. Good game control - very intuitive. However, if you already have a chess game you like, then don't waste money on this one. The online component is fun, but playing chess online has been done before, too."
4,Great!,It helps the time go by really fast when I'm doing stuff like waiting for my girlfriend to get done shopping.
3,chess game,"Not to good, the chess game it self is ok, but the kingdom stuff is not. it moves around to much........"
2,Deceptive Advertisment,"This product is touted as being full of information, which it is. However, it's next to useless for the busy classroom teacher: no lesson plans, no tests or quizzes, and only one small section with essay topics.Save your money. Don't buy this unless you need a souped-up version of Cliff's Notes to study for a test. This is not helpful to the teacher except for context, which is often skipped in high school due to time constraints."
5,I love this recording.,"I don't speak spanish, so I can't comment on the lyrics, but this music speaks to me in another way. This is one of the greatest rock albums ever produced, and I don't think they are copying U2, the Cure or anyone else. It's too bad there isn't a market for non-english music in the U.S., because if there was this album would have been huge."
5,Healing For Damaged Emotions,This book has been a tremendous help to me and I have given several copies to friends. easy to read and identify with.
3,Healing and Damaged Emotions came in a timely manner and in somewhat o.k. condition.,I inadvertenly ordered an older version of the book. It is not Amazon's fault. Sight unseen sometimes this happens. Still all of the information will be there. It was yellowed and perhaps will not hold up as well as a newer edition.Thanks anyhow.
5,What a blessing!,This book has blessed me so deeply at a time when I really needed it. I would love meet the author and learn more!
5,"Very helpful, easy read, practical",Really got a lot out of this book. Reading it at a time the Lord has brought two people with deeply held painful past to my life. Helps me to understand their behavior and specific ways to help them.
4,great encouragement,this book was very helpful to me and believe others will benefit from it i highly recommend for those hurting
5,Seamands at his best,"Christian psychology, this is a must for all who have counseling in their hearts.. Or maybe you are in need of person healing Then give this book a chance...5 star is toolittle for this book I give it 10 ... Mike Wilden"
3,good helper,"I needed spiritual help to move past some hurtful situations that I was unable to let go of and were plaguing my life. This book provided insightful ways to learn to cope with such feelings as anger, depression, and most of all forgiveness. Anyone searching for some extra help should check this book out!"
5,Awesome!!!!,"If I could use just one word to describe this book, it would be POWERFUL. Anyone who is dealing with or has ever dealt with or needs to deal with emotional baggage should read this book. As I was reading, it felt like the author knew me and some of the things I've dealt with. This book is a good read and I recommend it highly."
5,An encouraging writer,I was looking for a copy of this to send to a special friend. I didn't know whether it was still available and was so pleased to find it.
5,Very wise.,"Even though this book has been in print a long time, it gives sound advice for anyone who is willing to ponder what it says."
3,Pretty standard rah-rah military history,"This is a history with a small scope. It does not offer the insight microhistories can provide, nor the understanding that might be found with a wider lens.Readers can learn something of what it was like for Marines during the battles described in the book. Discussion of why the battle was fought (what did the North Vietnamese choose then and there) is minimal, as is description of what resulted from the fights beyond casualties.The writing is pretty good, but reading it feels like getting a blow-by-blow description of a bar fight without being told much about combatants or what was at stake."
3,pretty good,It could have been better. The song I bought it for turned out not to be the one I was looking for. Has some great rocking tunes though.
2,"Not so good, but...","Well, before anything else, any collection that has Kiss and Aerosmith is already worthwhile. However it is not the case, where the music, unhappily are weak and they don't correspond the expectations. I recommend not to buy that CD, giving preference to other existent collections. Any way, for who doesn't know anything of those bands and would like to have, it is a good beginning."
3,Brief but Informative,A very good brief history of the US Coast Guard. Gene Rachlis is an excellent writer and by the end of the book you'll feel satisfied that you know enough about the history of that great lifesaving service.
2,Awful,"Short, boring, & appears to be written using news reports & articles without a single personal interview & no conclusion (even though it happened so long ago).I like this author, but this book should be on the trash pile (or at the very least, the clearance rack).Save your money & Google the event...that's what the author did anyway. And you will probably find fewer typo's too."
2,Only for a outline,"Basically,I don't believe a book whick is mistaken soneone's birthday.(Affects data's accuracy)If you want to read this book,you should keep the fact ""there's lots of mistake""in your mind.in 2012,this is mere a outline and a result of public need in 2001,which gathered available source.If you have a mind which is not easily manipulated, This will be good as ""one of source in 2001"".If not,you'd better stay away.I don't think this is fair for defendants(especially two non-shooters) and victim,both."
1,Great Movies,I had seen both of them before on TV and wanted to add them to our collectio so we could enjoy them without commercials. It was a bonus to find them together .
5,It's a Keeper!,"Both movies are wonderful, sweet and safe for family viewing. ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" is filmed in Langley, BC Canada--where I used to live, so it is enjoyable to pick out the old locations I used to go to. The movie is predictable, but wonderfully pulled together by Henry Winkler and I love the chemistry between the two lead actors. Moonlight & Mistletoe is also sweet and endearing--not quite as good as the first movie in the duo, but still a family-friendly ""boy gets girl"" fare. HoHoHo!"
3,entertaining for a little while,i got this game on a disc that came with like 3 other games and played this. its entertaining and even as a redneck myself i find it funny. good way to pass the time.graphics arent anything great and game play is so so but its entertaining
4,Great fun for the wife,This a good humored game for the wife who is sick of the husband out hunting all the time. It has funny graphics and is not over borring.
1,dumb,"I don't know if I would call this a game, games are supposed to be fun and this is not. For a description of what the game is like I suggest this, go outside in your backyard and spin around. The basic premise is that you are a deer who is too dumb to walk forward or backwards, the only thing you are smart enough to do is turn (although that seems like the more difficult thing for a deer to do). You wait until these little men come out and shoot them with your gun. The game tries to be funny but the jokes are not that good and the only have a couple so its very boring."
2,Might be fine if I could get it to work consistently,"I've tried multiple sets of brand new batteries, repositioning the PC in relation to the keyboard and mouse, moving the USB transmitter - all to no avail.No matter what I've tried productivity is seriously affected by slow or no response from the mouse. I bought this to replace a wireless set I had that plugged into the mouse and keyword ports. It worked great until I just wore it out.I wanted the padded keyboard and like the shape of this mouse. If only I could get it to work accurately and consistently."
2,"Keyboard great....Mouse, not so...","I bought this unit to use in my home. I was greatly disappointed in the the performance from day 1. The keyboard works great. I haven't had a problem with it. The mouse is a completely different story. No matter what color/texture surface you use, the performance is very choppy. I have to click numerous times to get it to respond and you can forget double clicking.I thought maybe this is just a problem that I have at home so I brought it to work. My mouse is 2 feet from the computer and I'm still having the same problems.My advice? Buy another product."
2,Taking it back...,Although the keyboard is user friendly I constantly lose connectivity from both the keyboard and the mouse causing nothing but frustration!!! The box says up to 30 feet however the keyboard and mouse are only about 2 feet from the USB connection.
1,WOW is the reception bad,"Great design, love the slim keyboard and mouse feels great. I planned to use this as my media center setup because of the 30 ft range, but let me tell you 3 inches is not enough to ensure a stable link and reliable performance. After failing to perform on my laptop 6 ft away with direct LOS, I moved to a PC instead with the sensor 2 feet away, and had exact same issues. These include the mouse that simply refuses most of the time to double click, or single click, or move smoothly. I'm a PC tech, so all standard troubleshooting was done. Deal breaker, it is going back to the store. Pitty, because I REALLY like the keyboard and mouse design... but come on, if it is going to be wireless please make it work as such."
4,How times change...,"I am new to Asimov, so going through The Complete Robot stories was a crash course. These stories give a perspective of the future and our relationship with technology that is different than the prevailing ""trekkish"" view, and one that may not be so optimistic. While sometimes the stories are nothing more than thinly veiled logic puzzles, they are always entertaining - and sometimes infuriating. And the differences between Asimov's vision and today's technologies (No PCs? No Printers? Huge Mainframes?)is amusing see in hindsight. A must read for any sci fi fans."
2,Its ok,I do have severe occipital neuralgia so its not really this products fault that it didn't curb the pain. might work for more mild cases.
2,I don't feel the magic,I have occipital neuralgia - I am not feeling any relief or magic with this product - I keep trying - but neuralgia is complicated and it is hard to really tell if this helps or not. Certainly not a miracle cure.
1,Don't waste your Money !!!!,"This CD is just another fiasco by Univision, Mariana brings nothing but a big marketing machinery and little talent, so go for something better like Paulina Rubio or Pilar Montenegro and don't waste your money on this CD, trust me its not worth it,.Este CD es solo un producto mas de la mercadotecnia y la falta de talento de esta cantante inventada al vapor, la muisca esta malisima y su propuesta muiscal es una burda copia de Jennifer Pena y Pilar Montenegro, compre mejor otro CD y No desperdicien su Dinero como yo, el mio esta a la venta usado...."
5,Gran Disco Debut de Mariana!,"Este es el gran debut de Mariana Seoane como cantante. ""Sere Una Niña Buena"" es el nombre del primer disco de Mariana. La verdad cuando me entere que Mariana Seoane se lanzaba como cantante, no pense que fuera muy buena en la musica. Mariana es una actriz Mexicana y yo pense que no tenia voz para cantar. Pero me equivoque. Este disco tiene los 2 exitos de Mariana como: ""Me Equivoque"" y ""Que No Me Faltes Tu."" El disco tiene 13 canciones al ritmo de cumbia. Hace unos dias a Mariana le otorgaron un disco de oro por vender mas de 100,000 copias de el disco ""Sere Una Niña Buena."" Ademas el disco, ""Sere Una Niña Buena"" estuvo nominado en la categoria ""Mejor Album Grupero del Año 2004"" en los Grammy Latinos 2004. En esa misma categoria estuvieron Ana Barbara, Ninel Conde, Alicia Villareal y alguien mas. Alicia Villareal se llevo el Grammy Latino. Compren este disco y no se arrepentiran. Mariana es La Reina de La Cumbia!"
2,Not impressed,"Did not hold up much and completely died within a few months. Could be a camera problem, or it could be this battery. Either way, camera no longer works"
4,Battery fits EX-Z77,"The Eforcity compatible NP-20 battery fits perfect to the Casio EX-Z77. It's a wonderful replacement to the original one that came with the camera. The original Casio battery totally bites. It died after I charged it a few times. I didn't have any problem taking out the replacement battery. Others were concerned about the battery being stuck. I was too. No problems here. I didn't have to use tweezers. The battery life lasted just as long as the original one. I only used it for a few weeks. Time will tell if it can rechargeable in the coming months. So far, I am pleased with the inexpensive replacement."
2,Thicker battery,"I have the exact problem. The label is thicker, therefore the battery can not pop out. Yes, twizer and knife would work but that may not be available all the time when you are in the field. Peeling off the label would work, thus revealing the metal case of the battery, but that would creat an electrical short sometimes. You may have to find a new camera then. I had tried to put 5 mils kapton tape to cover the metal battery case but it would not pop out again. Therefore, the battery is somewhere 0-10 mils thicker than the OEM part. Cheap battery, we get what we paid for."
3,Cheap price...not so great fit.,"A lot cheaper than an OEM battery, but fit isn't that great. The battery is a little difficult to remove from the camera, but no big deal considering the price."
4,no lo tomen tan mal y disfruten esta música,"La pura verdad es que, guardando un poco las distancia, muchas de las canciones de este album se me parecen en su estructura, los coros y la forma de cantar a las canciones de ERASURE y eso ya es mucho decir. Es un gran disco pop, prejuicios aparte."
5,Candyman,"Gotta love Tony Todd and his creepy voice he is the perfect scary movie actor to give you chills, even if he's not bad looking."
3,Book Club,"I had a hard time with this book because of all the names of people, places, landmarks. It was just hard for me to skim those things. It is a good story, though."
2,a mundane read,"the themes of this book could be classified as ""vaguely"" interesting, but the writing was extremely mundane and the story plodded along tediously with heavy, dragging footsteps. i also found the story to be overly sweet and cliche. highlights of the book, if they exist, could be fiela's depth of character and her hypocrisy, but even this spark of hope is eradicated by the saccharine content. the ending was predictable from the first sentence of the book, stooping to the level of a soap opera. too bad, but an amusing read at times."
3,"search for ziggy, And the Angels Sing","I searched Amazon for Ziggy Elman's classic trumpet solo in the song And the Angels Sing. It was not clear what rendition was on the disc, but I took my chance on the 1 94i7 & 1949 issue. I was sisappoointed to find that Ziggy's trumpet was not solo, the drums nearly drownwd it out. The CD, however was shipped promptly. If anyone knows where to find the classic, soul stirring rendition, I would appreciate being able to find it."
4,"Loud, Crude and Great","The vocals are muddly, the guitar fuzzy, the drums loud and fast. The whole effect is blues music meets punk music and it works. I'm a fan of the White Stripes, Detroit cobras and Soledad Brothers but I'm also a fan of the Clash, Rancid and Refused. The ILCK sound like the meeting point between those two sets of bands. If that is your gig then you'll liekly appreciate the very stripped down feel of this album."
4,Lee county killers like a fresh new Gun Club,"The Lee County Killers preach the gospel of full tilt nitro powered rocket roll on this album,reminds one of some bizzare time shifting night during which a young Jerry Lee Lewis cranked out of his skull grabs the mic from Jon Spencer and brings back the living dead Jeffrey Lee Pierce for a sonic attack that lays down the county law. If you are looking for something that truly rocks, you have found it. A hard rocking two piece! How these boys make this much noise is unknown, catch themlive if you can, listen to this cd to remember! hell, what do I know, listen to 'em, click above."
1,Completely useless,I bought this book expecting having mathematical details on how tables were computed and it is only a compilation of well know articles for 200$ !!! It could have contain mathematical proofs for this price but there is event not at least on proof... I'm very disappointed for the price that does not justify the content.
5,Finest of the flavors,"I use this as shower soap . It last me six months, smells the best and does not burn like the peppermint ."
1,The price is inaccurate,"Nothing against the soap, but the listing says this is 27 cents per ounce, which is way lower than the real price. If you figure it at 30 cents an ounce, that would work out to $38.40 for the whole bottle. It's a good soap, but know what you're really paying."
3,A good education material for young people,"The event described in this DVD was very touching, the force of the revolution was caused and successfully realized by the culture and its everyday people. Our 10 year old boy watched the DVD with us and I do believe it will stay with him for sometime."
5,A great history lesson,We had no idea the Estonian people used their songs to maintain their nationality and eventually help gain independence from the Soviet regime. This is a well-done documentary that demonstrates the importance of staying strong (and alive) against oppression.
5,"Moving, Gripping and Inspiring!","My mother, pregnant with me, fled Estonia to escape the Soviet takeover. I was brought up with the Estonian spirit, language and culture through my mother's spirit. ""The Singing Revolution"" powerfully describes the other holocaust, Stalin's Holocaust, which no one talks about and few people know of. It movingly depicts the resilience and strength of a people who would not allow anything to eradicate them. It poignantly illustrates how peaceful demonstration can topple the iron fist of a brutal regime. After seeing this gripping and educational documentary, I can only say that I am so very proud to be an Estonian, and I thank my mother for having insisted that I never forget my Estonian roots. A MUST-SEE MOVIE!!"
5,Passing Down Hope Through Song,"As an American with absolutely no ties to Eastern Europe and barely any memory of communism, I found this film exceptionally moving. It's an excellent documentary about a piece of history that's ignored too often. Shows how a people, united by culture, although not fully united in their goals, were able to destroy the Soviet power over them. Be prepared for some heart-wrenching personal stories and terrifying wartime footage. The website has additional resources for teachers."
3,Mindless 60's fun,"These films littered drive in's across the nation during the 60's. Chrome and Hot Leather doesn't take itself too seriously. In one scene, lead heavy the great WIlliam Smith notices one gnag member is missing and calls to him, ""Larry...we ar MENACING someone over here"". the late Marvin Gaye has a role as one of the green beret bikers who inact revenge. Mini Skirt mob is about girl hoodlums led by Patty McCormick, who cause trouble pay the price and so forth. Just miscreant behavior here, no skin if that is what you are looking for."
3,Big Bill Rides Again,"CHROME AND HOT LEATHER, another biker epic from the 70's starring the man, the legend, the best crazed over the edge psycho in the history of motion pictures: William Smith. Ok, this bugger won't win any awards but it has Big Bill. What else does one need?"
3,Back In The Day,"I first saw ""Chrome And Hot Leather"" in 1985.I enjoy the film mainly for the bikes.There are a couple of scenes that really show off the bikes,one in particular when Marvin Gaye rides up to a few guys sitting on a warehouse deck,enjoying a few beers.The bikes in that scene are beautiful.If your like me and into Harleys and nostalgia this film captures a little bit of that from 1971.Unfortunately the ""Mini Skirt Mob"" does nothing for me.Some beautiful ladies in the film though!"
5,Fun rhymes!,"Really fun rhymes to teach some Spanish vocabulary terms (book ""flow"" though is in English)."
4,Review of Say Hola to Spanish,"Say Hola to SpanishBy Susan Middleton ElyaReading Level 1.3Say Hola to Spanish teaches all the basic words in a dictionary (like table, horse, etc...). Once your young son/daughter reads this book. He/she will be sharing this book with friends and talking Spanish when she knows something he/she can say. This is a great book for birthday presents, presents for communions, and Christmas presents. This is a great book for children ages 4 to 6. If you would like to learn the basic Spanish this is the book for you!"
4,Good stuff,Nice cheese and it survived shipping overseas in August without incident. I will buy again.
3,Little dense,"I like this book, but sometimes it's a little hard to follow. If you are jumping into Isseah, start with a basic translation. This is a good addition, but I keep finding better ones."
1,What a waste of ...,I bought this book and was completely blow off by the amount of false information. I am a R.I. (Ranger Instructor) here at Fort Benning and have met the author. I feel Robert Bertrand is trying to a make a quick buck on selling false information to easy prey. Please do your own research before buying this book like I should have.
5,High Speed Publication,"This past weekend I had the opportunity to meet and speak with the co-author of this publication, William C. Peterson III. This very intelligent and highly motivated gentleman approached me and some of my friends when he noticed we were holding and talking about The Hooah Schools book. He began to guide us through the book pointing out key factors on the many different schools and what it truly meant to graduate from them. The amount of information provided inside the cover is incredible and I suggest to ALL Soldiers (male and female)here in the U.S. and overseas to invest in this manual.On a seperate note to Mr. Peterson, I look forward to your publications and meeting you again in the future. Capt.Mullins"
4,An old friend with some new looks I didn't like,"Long ago, I owned the 45 that had Broken Teenage Heart and The Bully of the Town. While I was pleased to get the CD, I thought the graphics were second rate. Nothing at all wrong with the music, most of which I hadn't heard."
4,the man certainly can Yodel,"I was lucky enough to see Kenny Roberts several times when I was a kid,and I never for got him. I was very happy to find this cd. If you enjoy yodeling, I dare say this will be some of the best you have ever heard.And he sings very well also.So many people claim to yodel and can not this is the real deal.Yodel-Ay-Ee-Oooo: The Secret History of Yodeling Around the World"
5,Faun,I just started to get inot this style of music. I found it very different but very refreshing. It let me make stories in my mind as the sound made it all come to life. i will be buying more from this group!!!
5,Life changing,"A great book that actually makes you think. We have an opportunity to do great things for God in the Church and in the secular world. No matter what our circumsatnces are or no matter who we want to blame for our apathy, and lack of drive--at the end of the day it is our choice. We have been given the gift from God to choose--so let us choose wisely! Let us not hide behind prayer to be inactive and not move forward. It is a sin to know what is good and right and sit and do nothing. Just do it!I truly recommend this book if you want to experience all the life changing plans God has for each one of us (even if they seem scary they will be fulfilling). Life should have adventure and excitement!"
5,I love this book!,This book takes a simple story in the bible that I never thought much about and puts it into today's perspective. I learned so much about the nature of people and how to seize the moment from this book. It is so very well written and easy to read and understand. I'm recommending it to everyone I know who has become stagnant in their lives.
3,just another review,"This was a good book in that it confirmed some of the things I was doing in my walk with Jesus, and also encouraged me to step out. The author kept returning to scripture about Jonathan, good scripture but way over used. He also kept referring to and adventure of Ayden that he never fully described. Those two things aside this was a good book to check where you came from and where you are going in your spiritual live."
3,A Decent Mystery,"Jonnie Jacobs' writing has gotten significantly more sophisticated since her first Kate Austen mystery more than a decade ago. With multiple plot turns, layered characters, and vivid descriptions, Witness for the Defense definitely holds its own. There are some issues with plotting (would a wealthy couple with money to burn really opt for a defense lawyer no one has ever heard of, and who handles adoptions as well as criminal defense? Is it a little too unlikely that several plot lines would be tied together so neatly?), but overall, the book kept me guessing on several fronts until the end. The final revelations were more than a little bit out of left field, but I'm willing to overlook them in favor of Jacobs' clear, compelling writing."
3,family ties,"for an attorney with a client on trial for murder, she spends an inordinate amount of time musing about her personal life and her unfulfilled emotional needs. an unseemly mix of diary type reflections and courtroom drama. abrupt,unsatisfying conclusion to the trial, after some workmanlike courtroom scenes. plot's loose ends are fastened by the convenient velcro of coincidence."
1,Awful addition to a once great series,"Like many out there, I fell in love with the McNally books, due to the fun mystery plots and the characters within. However it has gotten ""tired."" This is part to Lawrence Sanders's death as well as Vicent Lardo's repeated sequels. I find in this latest book, not much enjoyable. It is so hard to put this into words, but with the mystery was lackluster and the characters so two dementional I had to actually ""plod"" through this book. Thankfully many authors, upon their death, have their characters die with them and I think that is as it should be. I trust like other series characters written in Sanders's life time (Edward X. Delany to name one) that Lardo decide to allow Mr. McNally to go, instead of dying a slow painful death on the stage of his books."
2,I didnt like them,"I gotta say, i didnt like these. I really think you cant get nearly the same texture or taste when youre going lowcarb with a bagel, and i shouldnt have expected it. The bakery probly makes delicious foods, but this is not one of them. I tried toasting them as hard as i could, but they were still spongy. Couldnt eat them =("
4,Not my favorite editon,"If I could recommend a particular edition of the ""Interesting Narrative,"" it would be the Penguin Classics revised 2003 edition. I much preferred it to this one. The Penguin edition has far more explanatory and textual notes, and it includes many letters Equiano wrote. (Which the Modern Library edition does not do.)"
4,Thoroughly enjoyed it!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It does not speak as much about slavery as I thought and speaks a lot about ship life. There is a wonderful chapter on his faith. I recommend this book to those who desire to know about life during the late 1700's especially for a black man.
3,Somewhat interesting might be more accurate...,"I can't help but think there's some bit of embellishing on the part of Equiano here, which calls the veracity of everything into question.As a semi-fictional account of a freed slave at that point in history, it's an interesting book, I suppose.There are probably more interesting and inspiring books related to Olaudah, Wilburforce, and the entire Abolitionist movement, although after reading this and a sub-average book on William Wilburforce, I lost steam on the topic.Get yourself a DVD of Amazing Grace, accept it at face value, and don't slog through Equiano's work in a tedious exercise of cross-checking facts, that quite frankly makes you look terribly pedantic, fella."
1,false advertising,"These claim to be for a 1990-1997 Miata. They aren't. They don't even come close to lining up right. They're a cheap generic flap that look and feel it. Do not buy these! Plus, there's only 2, not 4."
1,Poorly Cited,"From a non-denominational Christian perspective who knows both Muslims and Coptics in the US, this book is interesting historically, but I have asked clergy about points made in this text and there are many flaws in how it represents Coptic beliefs."
3,"Nice Instrumentation, Limited Melodies","Maybe a better title for this CD would be Instrumental Prowess Without Melodes. I always enjoy listening to the musicians in Spyro Gyra feed off each other while they jam. There are many nice fusion and jazz touches on this Stories Without Words recording.However, whereas the CD is growing on me with each new listen, I just do find many of these melodies to be memorable. Del Corazon has a nice guitar passage and other tracks have a delightful Carribean flavor. However, the lack of consistent strong melodies on this CD cause me to give it a 3-3 1/2 star rating and recommend that readers of this reveiw seek out Morning Dance, Three Wishes or Catching The Sun before this recording. However, there is no denying the talents of this band."
2,Go for something a little better,I have an ipod touch so i thought i would get this because it was cheap. First off what you get and what is in the picture are two different things. The Car charger worked out alright but i have only gotten the home charger to work once. All the other times it charges for about 10 seconds and then just stops. Just go for something a little better that will actually work.
3,You get what you pay for,"The charger that plugs into the wall made a ton of noise and died quickly (after only a few uses). I have had better luck with car chargers than with ones that plug into the wall, so I purchased an inverter to convert 115 VAC (wall power) into 9VDC (car-type power) and charge my phone that way. The unit I use wasn't cheap, and is big/bulky, but I'd rather do that and use USB power than constantly replace chargers."
1,This ain't no masterpiece,"The author and her kronies are doing their best to try and sell this book. hmmm. did you look at the rating score? How about the ranking number.Losers are losers. This book is far from a winner. Parents don't appreciate the content and smart teenagers find this laughable. What's worse... well that all the positive reviews basically say the same thing but from a different ""fake"" person. All publishers know this chic's writing career is over. There is always room for writing for reality shows. This book is just plain dumb. Characters have no personality and the author's story is just too boring... stuck in the 80's. Who fricking cares.... get real old lady and write about now. Turn on VH1. Go Brady Brunch."
1,Holy Crapola!,"Had I known this book was as trashy as a Britney/ Kevin home video, I would have thought twice. The characters are sluts. Sluts. The author writes so poetically on her life experiences. It's not a very good shot at a first time novel but she sure knows how to write trash."
1,Where is the plot?,And.....? So the story is about the lives of 3 girls. whoop-dee-doo.Where is the actual story.. I'm on the last page and still looking....
4,Better than it's being given credit for,"First of all, I will start by saying that I don't think this book is meant for all readers. I wouldn't encourage my pre-teen daughter to read it. That being said, I am an adult who loved this story. The author writes the book in memoir style, and I think that the people who are criticizing its grammar need to realize that the grammatical errors are intentional. It is part of the style. Not everyone enjoys this style, but the author and the editors are not stupid, every word on every page is the way that it is to make the book what it is. I applaud the author for being so raw, honest and believable. I think that if you attended this school (as many of the customer reviewers did) you may be taking the story too personally. The location may be real, but the characters are fictional, and wonderfully done!"
3,Not what I expected,"This book wasn't what I expected it to be, but it was still somewhat interesting. Not one of my favorites, but regardless, I'm glad I read it."
1,a waste of time,"Normally I don't see the need to pick on first-time-novelists. They did manage to finish a book. But on the other hand, this stuff is taking up spaces in bookstores where decent -- or even fun -- literature could be instead. Whores on the Hill has a catchy title and it ends there. It is flat-out poorly written and it's clear it's been a VERY long time since the author was a midwest teenager. The only part that makes me think she's plugged in to how teenagers talk or what they want to read is that this reminds me of a 9th grade writing project."
2,Not for your child,[...] The content is not what our young readers are looking for nor need to have. There are much better and well-written books out there on this topic. This author has typos and both grammatical and sentence structure errors throughout. It was poorly written and poorly edited by the publisher. This author seems to be a rebel. She seems to have the need to tell her story. I think teenagers seem to have a need to talk to their parents about these issues not read this book.
3,GO HO GIRLS!,"Power to the women! These girls make choices..whether it is dating, pregnancy or a romp with another girl, they make choices. I'm not sure I agree that this book is for teenagers but dating mates should read it to learn what girls are thinking. I agree with another reviewer that the writing is not so good but I like the liberal feminist approach."
5,Remember when.....,"The negative reviews on this site shocked me at first, until I noticed a common trend. They were all written by parents. As far as I, a 17 year old, am concerned, anyone attempting to dismiss or attack this book has forgotten what it was like when they themselves were ""fifteen and knobby-kneed and you only had a handful of choices. Your world was small and cruel and narrow-minded and breathtaking."" This book is the most honest piece of literature I have read in a long time. Every high school girl in America today will see a heartbreaking shadow of themselves in one of these characters, be it reckless Astrid, complicated Julie, or sensitive Thisbe. The negative backlash from adults is simply another victory for this amazing novel. This story belongs to us, we live it everyday, in some form or another."
1,BOOTY CALL,"Wake up girls. This book is nothing more than a booty call. There is no depth to it. All those reviewers who claim it is beautiful and the best, obviously don't see the real depth of it... sex, sex, rape, abortion, sex, ..the life of a loss soul. [...]"
3,Whores on the Hill,"The book started out as I expected, but ended not like I thought. Didnt like the twist at the end. It all seemed very real until the end of the book. Then it got a little far fetched, more like a soap opera. ..."
4,A Silent Film Surprises As A Delightful Combination Of Fellini And Chaplin,"2003's ""Margarette's Feast"" was perhaps the biggest surprise I've encountered in a while. This delightfully demented silent film plays as equal parts Chaplin and Fellini. At the beginning, the film strikes the perfect balance between realnness and robust humor. I appreciated that even things like company layoffs were handled in a outrageously funny way. As our hero navigates the mean streets of the city, the film showcases a smart satiric edge. Things continue to get more fanciful, however, and the whole thing goes on a beat too long for my personal taste--but still it is daring and unique filmmaking. A must see for adventurous movie lovers who would like to see silent films updated in a very relevant way. KGHarris, 8/11."
2,Don't bother with this book,"I'm a graduate student (Ph.D. level program) and was looking for materials I could use for references in my school psychology class. I also have a child with delayed social skills, so I had a more personal interest in looking at this book.I found this book to be of little use, professionally as well as personally. The research was sorely lacking, and the tips and suggestions were fairly rudimentary and geared toward lower elementary school youth.There are far better products out there, so save your money. I sent this one back."
4,Good program material,"This is a beautiful, informative video. I used it for a book club program, and it was much enjoyed by the members. My one complaint was the difficulty in understanding the comments of one of the main interviewees. His accent was so strong that we Americans could not understand his English. The ones that were translated were much more helpful."
5,Practical Resource,"As a [...] consumer, I have yet to buy a book from these publishers that wasn't worth the asking price. These books are that useful! As a practicing paralegal in the Golden State, I consider myself fairly industry savvy but still found information contained within that I didn't find elsewhere. I'm not comfortable with [...] having the monopoly on subjects of this nature because any time there is only 1 provider of any given thing, that provider tends to gouge consumers. That will change as competition develops. In the interrim, however, this book is a good resource. Highly recommended."
3,"A predictable, but enjoyable, read","I read Forrester, O'Brien, Conrad, Mayrrat, and Melville, so I felt I should read Kent. He is not in the same category. He is an enjoyable read, don't get me wrong, but he telegraphs so much of his action that you see it long before it happens. Young Bolitho is a bit too self-conscious, a bit too able. Some characters are introduced only to provide a moment of bathos when they catch the number of their mess. Read it, if for no other reason than to see how much better Jack Aubrey and Horatio Hornblower are in comparison."
5,Addicting!,"This book will whet your appetite for the entire series. It is fast moving and extreamly hard to put down. The writing is such that I was there, on deck, with young Richard. Great book!"
5,Good book and series -- and comparable series,"""Midshipman Bolitho"" is an excellent and early example of this genre. Bolitho is interesting and by starting earlier than C.S. Forrester or Patrick O'Brian the author provides a different perpective. As with many in this genre, Kent convincingly portrays not only the strategic and tactical aspects of the war, but also the ship construction/handling challenges. ""Les Miserables"" its not, but Kent also explores the society of the time and develops a number of interesting and and sympathetic characters. The series maintains its quality over the next 18 or so books. Those interested in discovering other, comparable series should pursue: C.S. Forrester, Patrick O'Brian, Richard Woodman, Dewey Lambdin or James Nelson. Other, harder-to-locate series for the addicts are from Dudley Pope, Porter Hill, Victor Suthren or Frank Eccles. I would welcome information about other similar series -- also other naval eras, army fiction, or merchant marine."
2,Not nearly as good as the competition,"This is not nearly as good as the competition.The grammar is poor. Sentence fragments abound.The stories are ok, but there is no cleverness to the writing.For a more literary experience and better stories, in a seafaring vein, try1) the Horatio Hornblower series by C.S. Forresteror2) Master and Commander, by Patrick O'Brien.These are both wonderful, prolific writers, who write on the same subject as Mr. Kent, with much more style and elegance."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This book actually contains two novels. The first one is quite good, but the second one, concerning smugglers, seems to have been written for children. In the second novel the characterizations are thin, and the events are at once incredible and predictable. I can see this as a Walt Disney movie. Even so, I was impressed enough with the first novel to try another book by Kent. I am currently reading Stand Into Danger, the second in the Bolitho series, and it convinces me to stay on board for the rest of the Bolitho novels. At this point I rank Kent below O'Brian, Forester and Woodman. But that's not too bad."
3,Still waiting for Hornblower's successor,"Not bad, much better than the detail-obsessed Patrick O'Brian. C.S. Forester still rules the seas of naval fiction. That said, this is the first Bolitho novel I've read and I intend to continue reading the series..."
4,Helpful but not Miraculous,"The seat cover fits my seat very well, and it stays very secure while I ride. There is a lot of cushion, and it definitely helps make my bike less painful to ride, however it is not a 100% improvement. The covered seat is still a bit hard to sit on, but I can ride comfortably for much longer periods of time than I could without it. I would recommend this product."
1,Horrible,"I am extremely disappointed with this product. I only bought one because my recent seat was stolen. I had it for easily 1-2yrs and it was still in pretty good shape. The one I recently purchased is horrendous. I will have to purchase another after only a month's use. It has ripped at the sides, the gel is coming out. I do not understand how all the previous gel seats I have bought have consistently lasted for at least a year and this one did not last even a month. This was the worst purchase made."
4,"This really has saved my, well, you know","Very comfortable. The gel pad has taken away all pain and made riding quite enjoyable.However, after about 200 - 300 miles, the seam came apart and shows some of the gel. Not really a complaint, but it would be great if this lasted longer. I still consider this a good deal for $[...]"
4,Not for bicycles,"I did a search on Amazon for bicycle seat cover. I saw the picture for this and the price and it looked perfect. Unfortunately, I scanned the reviews too quickly. What I thought I read was that it was a bit too tight so I was thinking this would be perfect for a road bike. But in reality it apparently is perfect for a STATIONARY bike. One of those with the huge seat on it. For a bicycle this thing is too big, at least for standard seats.I rated it for the quality and price which is good. The description is misleading."
2,Dont buy it,"I bought it not for softening my saddle. The fact is I have a Selle SRL Titanium saddle in red color and I wanted something to use as a cover to preserve this expensive saddle during I transport my bikes or when I have to ride in very muddy conditions. So I bought this product purely as a ""cover"" and I didn't make much research on this item, supposing that ""any will fit""First of all, I was very unpleasantly surprised by the weight of this product. It is unreasonably heavy, very heavy. It is made very big just to be more universal and fit more saddles, but its not the best idea. If you apply it on narrow saddle, than you cant fix this cover at all. It moves and slips all the time. Fixing strand is another bad idea. In fact, I can't find any positive point in this product thus I can't recommend it. Don't waste your money!"
1,It sucks!,Me and my husband bought these covers and they suck. They are squishy but it still leaves your butt very sore after you ride your bike. Neither of us are overweight. We put these on our Schwinn bicycles. Neither of us like this cover at all.
3,warning: easily stolen,"I bought one of these at Wal-Mart, worked great for a year, comfortable, easy to install, etc., but then it was simply removed & stolen by a passerby. I can't think of a good way to 'lock' it on so I'm just going with a comfortable seat that can't be taken off so easily. Be warned."
3,Too thin for me.,"Really thin gel, I still use it, but I am looking for a thicker one, get it if you are a light person."
3,very wide.,"I was unaware how wide this seat was going to be. It's more for a fat cruiser seat. If you have a tiny bike seat this won't fit. It is very cushiony and comfortable, though."
2,My Tail Bone Says Ouch,"It's just not enough cushion for my poor tail bone! Perhaps the thin layer of gel may be enough for people already accustomed to riding, but for those just getting into or (like in my case) back into the sport, I'd suggest padded shorts instead. Those definitely eased the pain a lot more than the seat cover."
1,Poorly made,"After only 4 hours of use, this seat cover is starting to fall apart. The stitching is coming apart on the back part of the cover, and gel is coming out. This is a very poorly made product."
3,Caveat Emptor,"This really is a very nice seat cover, only it is made for thin seats and did not fit the exercise bicycle seat that it was advertised with. I was a little shocked that it was so obviously too small for the wide exercise bicycle seat. No one could have even tried to fit this seat cover. I would suggest that Amazon have a real human try to fit these things before pairing a seat cover up with an advertised exercise bicyle.Again, the exercise bicycle and the seat cover are really nice. The seat cover just does not fit over the seat that comes with the exercise bicycle."
3,3.5 stars if I could give half ratings,"Item does what it advertises - cushions your rear from hard seats. However, I've had mines about a month now, and it's already beginning to get ""compacted"" or flat. It's no longer as soft as it originally was, and it now starts to get uncomfortable after about an hour or so. But it's still not as bad as the seat without it.I use it on average twice a week for about 1.5 hours at a time.Also, unlike some of the other reviews here, thankfully it has not (as yet??) split and the gel start to leak out. It also is a bit wider at the back than most bike seats, so it sometimes slides about and goes off center slightly, even if you tighten the drawstrings as much as you could.Bottom line - it'll give your rear end some comfort, but if I could do it again I'll probably try for a comfy seat instead first."
2,not happy with the quality,"I bought this seat cover to reduce the hardness of my original seat to my hybrid bicycle. After only two days of using this cover, the stitching began separating on the stretch material which goes around the perimeter of the seat. I returned the product for a credit ... not worth the price."
2,Fabric ripped,"I weigh close to 240 and started using this in late July. i found this seat to be good, but the fabric on it has already ripped"
2,Wears thin quick,"This seat cover is very comfortable, but if your saddle is not the same size as the cover then the sides will wear thin quickly and the gel will seep out.Within 2 weeks the gel started to come out the sides."
4,it's a bike seat,"this is just what is says it is...a gel bike seat cover. nothing more or less. it works well, but nothing can take away the sting of spinning all the way lol"
3,Not as comfortable as id like,Its not as comfortable as id like but still better than the bare seat i have on my flat bar road bike. Fits fine and stays firmly on the seat. If i replace it i may go for something cushier.
2,Not a good product,Not a good product-- hurt my butt MORE when I used it and sat on it. Would not recommend. Also a bit bulky; when you take it off your bike (so people don't steal it) it's not that easy to fit into your carrying bags.
2,Poorly Assembled,"This seat cover is pretty thin, improving the comfort of the ride in a pretty marginal way. Also, the seams are loose and the gel insert beneath the nylon is completely visible after one 60-minute spin class. Save your money, folks and look elsewhere."
2,Not a big difference,"I purchased two of these, one for myself and one for my husband. Neither of us were able to notice any difference. It feels soft, it is not cheaply made by any means, but it just didn't do it for either of us. If I had to do it again, I would probably choose something different."
2,gel fusion is poor compared to gel fusion+,"I had earlier purchased a Bell Gel Contour Bicycle Seat Cover (""Bell Gel Fusion+"") (which is ASIN # B00069NW2I) from the local Fred Meyer department store, and had been fairly satisfied with it.For some reason, this time I ordered online the plainer and simpler looking Bell Gel Base Bicycle Seat Cover (""Bell Gel Fusion"") (which is ASIN # B00005OKZ7). It is surprisingly bad, relatively to the former. Much less comfortable, and you can feel the seam at the edge after riding for a while. Not worth saving $5.Not all the reviews seemed fair or accurate to me, but this really is a far inferior product compared to the competition.It's better than nothing, of course."
1,All Right,"Ignore those who claim this is an even-handed doc. It's a promotional film for the christian right thinly disguised as investigative journalism. It would have you believe, as many christians do, that the corruption and incompetence of the dimwit currently pretending to be president is easily overlooked so long as he talks about Jesus in public. A chilling view the triumph of superstition and fear over sanity."
5,Religion in the white house and as a campaign tool...,"Fabulous doco...Explores various religious aspects across more than a quarter of a century.The documentary discusses the importance of religion in modern politics and its place as a modern campaigning tool - using rare footage from Carter onward.The other focus of the program is on the president and his personal embrace of religion. Though some are cynical, the program enables a better understanding for those unfamiliar with some of the personal history of Dubya."
2,"Starts out good and objective, ends up as a blatant propaganda tool.","This was a very strange documentary. The first half is a very straightforward, objective and informative history of the evangelical influence on US politics from circa 1950. But by the last half all objectivity is thrown out the window and it turns into a very blatant promotional movie for George W. Bush and his handling of the 9/11, the Iraq War, etc., ending with Bush waving the flag and an interviewee saying he hopes God still has a plan for George W. Bush to help the world.Watch it if it's on TV, but I wouldn't recommend spending money on the DVD."
4,Very informative and surprisingly objective,"This was very interesting and informative. I was completely opposed to the Bush administration, and I didn't think this documentary gave a positive view of him or the religious right at all. I thought it was simply very objective and trying to just show facts rather than push any agenda."
5,Fluffy Soft before and after washing,"I was extremely pleased with this product even though I thought I was getting a purple duvet instead of the Lilac one I received. The picture description and advertisement that I was looking at had a deeper, richer looking purple, but since I'm not a stickler for color...I didn't let it bother me too much. After washing, I found this product to be the perfect fit for my comforter. It seems to make my comforter more fluffy, warm, and so comfortable. The Duvet on my comforter makes it so hard to get out of bed in the mornings...thank goodness for alarm clocks! I also bought the navy Duvet, (which is actually navy) this way while one is in the laundry the other can keep the comforter clean. I am very happy with my Duvet purchases."
4,Not bad for the price,It gave me a way to get that awful paisley print comforter that was handed down to me to match some of the stuff in my room. Decent quality and easy to remove and wash.
5,Exactly what I wanted,This product is exactly what I was looking for and fits my down comforter beautifully. It adds additional warmth and softness to my comforter and it washes up nicely.
4,Great quality for the price,I got it for $20 which is really cheap for its quality. It's soft enough and still remains soft after several washes. I'm very happy although I wouldn't pay anymore than what I paid for.
2,Not sized correctly,Ret'd because it was too small for my king size comforter. Also was not happy with the texture of the duvet.
1,Buyer Beware,"I ordered the Flying Bird Cat Toy. The color combination they sent me was unbelievably hideous: Purple base and pale pink and pistachio green bird! Their delayed response to my dissatisfaction was I would have to pay shipping back to them for credit. Thus I would have two shipping charges to return this item. Why would they produce an item that is so ugly, especially when their ad shows a lovely color combination? Do not order from these sellers without clarifying exactly what you will receive."
1,Atheist feeblemindedness,"I found the author of this book to be a little incoherent and a little SLOW himself. He is Grossly misinformed, and hardly scientific in his reasoning. He is, in short, worse off then those he attempts to Demonize. I do not recommend this book, and urge you to go watch the movie TomCats instead. It's filled with more truths then this book ever will."
1,Who is she trying to kid,This woman goes on about her life saving diet all the time discounting the fact that she did not follow her Doctors instructions (she ignored him when he said she didn't need a mastectomy - she actually admits she shouldn' have listened to someone not her doctor or that it might have been a good idea to at least duscus the information she got from this outsider with her doctor).she did have chemo chemo etc when her diet didn't work and her cancer came back! This is a waste of time!
2,Knowledge IS Power,"Dr. Plant's book is very interesting, and in many ways I agree with her: breast cancer has suffered greatly from lack of scientific knowledge: medicine is an art; it should not be relegated to the practicing physician alone but only as part of a team.That said, I caution the reader to relize there are no such words as ""survivor,"" or ""in remission"" when it comes to breast cancer: there are no objective, scientific analysis to prove any of the aforementioned. We lull women into passivity with 'positive,' sound bites, that are great for fund raising but do little for outcomes. The key is in the screening and diagnostic phase: once there is treatment question, diagnostic phase was flawed.""Only in silence may breast cancer continue (C.J.H. Thompson 1998)."" Never pay anyone you have not met and has spent time with you."
5,"Girlfriends, Think Soy!","I reduced my dairy intake and reduced my uterine fibroid in the process--thanks to Dr. Christiane Northrop's advice. Now Dr. Jane Plant confrims again the critical importance of keeping milk for the calves and moving to a more human-enhancing diet. Thank you Dr. Plant for all your research, your moving heroine's journey, and your scholarly persistence in the face of many fear-based doubters. l believe in what you say because I, too, have experienced renewed health by following your wise suggestions. I hope others will at least give your guidance a try---they will be pleasantly surprised to find that their lives are, indeed, in their own hands!"
2,Over-rated,"I bought this book based on the reviews contained in this section of Amazon. I am sorely disappointed in this book and its usefulness in my classroom. Having taught Shakespeare for over ten years, I find that this book brings nothing new to the table and I will probably never use it. The insight and suggested lesson plans are all old hat and boring. Oh, well............"
2,"Fun, but don't spend your money on it","I first saw this game at my friends house. My friend had Hard Truck 2 and I thought it was really cool.In hard truck 2 you can drive small trucks and big rigs. So I went and bought this game thinking it would be better,and all i got was a boring game that takes forever to get anywhere. Even if you like it the cheat codes are really confusing."
1,Boring Game,"I bought this game hoping for some fun, but all I got was a stupid AI and some boring gameplay. You compete against other Trucker Companies in the way of delivering goods from one point to the other point. The AI waits for you to select a order and then the AI also selects the same order and competes you. I started a game, and did almost nothing, and so did the AI. They did not try to take orders or anything. After playing the game for a hour or two, it just got so boring I had to stop playing it. The graphics are so-so, only buy it if you want to drive around in your truck and look at the graphics!"
2,Boring,It takes way to long to do anything. You have to drive for 10 minutes just to get from one place to another with your cargo+ it is just open road and scenary to look at. When you finally deliver your cargo you realise you need to deliver more and more and more to get enployees and a new truck.
4,a really thoughtful read,"I really enjoyed this book, and found myself returning to it whenever I could sneak some time in over the weekend. The message is simple, and poignant in light of the life of Mark Phillips. I have already passed it on to a male friend that I think would really appreciate this book in relation to his father and his son, and I have several others I will continue to pass it on to. It is good enough to recommend, and is a great gift for men who enjoy hunting and the outdoors."
4,Very Good. I enjoyed it!,"I just finished this book last night and enjoyed every word. I am glad I did not read the above review first, though, since it gives away most of the drama. The book shows, in essence, that there is drama in all of our lives, and this one was very well written. In the search for ""heroes"" you hear about these days, there is surely one in Mr. Phillips' father, just a good American that did his blue-collar job despite mind-numbing conditions and, later, enormous pain. If you like this book, and the memoir genre, try also Rick Bragg, All Over But The Shoutin'."
2,Not one of the best,"Hmmm - seems to me that to be a 'real' VH fan you kind of have to say you like this album. Well, I am, and I don't particularly. There is a lot of filler on this disc and you can tell there is some tension in the band.I'm just not sure 'Dirty Movies', 'Sinner's swing', 'So this is love' and 'Sunday Afternoon in the park' contribute to a very strong album. Nowhere near the zenith of '1984' or the first album. Sorry but I'm not going to say this is good just because it's become 'cool' to say it is."
5,Great like all DLR VH cds,"This CD is just great. From the hard rocking songs like ""Unchained"", and ""Sinners Swing"" to the almost disco sounding ""So Push Comes To Shove"" to the upbeat ""So Is This Love?"" this cd doesen't dissapoint. Not to mention Dave using the ""F"" word in Sinners Swing, adds to the power of the song, and album. Each Early Van Halen CD has its own unique overall sound to it. Every cd is a classic and a fan favorite. A must for all VH fans."
4,Van Halen's #2 album,It has some filler (A Walk in the Park) but makes up for it with One Foot Out the door. Van Halen's heaviest album.
5,High In The Creative Department,"This CD may have not been Van Halen's top seller. However, it is their most creative work in their batch. With a dark and eerie tone throughout, Eddie, Dave, Alex, and Michael provide with catchy riffs, ear grabbing lyrics, stylish vocals, and a backbeat that is steady throughout the CD. Eddie makes some very creative use of the synthesizer on several of the tracks which only adds to the style of the band. Whereas the sound is still quite heavy and hard, there are many dynamic elements that stand out on this CD such as the muted tone of When Push Comes To Shove, the background vocals and percussion effect on hear About It Later, and the many spoken word dialogues of Diamond Dave throughout. This is the hidden gem in Van Halen's collection and it should be owned by anyone claiming to be a fan of this band."
4,Fair Warning:One Great CD!,"Before all the craze that went with the release of ""1984"" Van Halen in 1981 Brought out a real hard rocking collection of tunes in ""FAIR WARNING"" The best songs are ""MEAN STREET"" ""DIRTY MOVIES"" AND THE RADIO FAVERITE ""UNCHAINED"" All in All a true gem to have a must for any Van Halen fan."
3,A Mixed Bag,"As a huge Van Halen fan for many years, I've always had mixed feelings about this album. On the one hand I think that the overall quality of the songs on the album really does not measure up to other Van Halen albums. However, the album does include two of the all-time great Van Halen songs, Mean Street and Unchained, which are nothing short of spectacular, and Dirty Movies is also a very good song, with Eddie doing some of his best work on these songs. Alex Van Halen and especially Michael Anthony play at their very best in this album, which gives it a dense hard rock sound, more so than other Van Halen albums. That being said, I think that the album suffers a little because the remaining songs are just not that good. The album is still a must buy for every Van Halen fan just because of Mean Street and Unchained."
3,1981 Van Halen,This plays like a typical Van Halen album from the David Lee Roth Era. Only they have made better albums than this. Key tracks are Mean Street and Unchained.
5,"4.5 STARS, Van Halen In A Heavy Metal Mood","The Fan Favorite. There darkest heaviest album. Hugely underated.

2,fairwarning.,what can i say about this cd. the band is flailing you can hear it. besides that there are some great guitar work and drumming. but by the time this cd was released when i heard it. it was the cassete version. i listened to it for days. and then its like all the joy and party antics that was vanhalen was gone. i got irratated hearing daves antics. but on the plus side its got some original tunes. which is more than i can say for the diver down cd. which was only second in the worst cd ever created.besides vanhalen 3.
3,Fair Warning!,"Van Halen's fourth album ""Fair Warning"" has to be the David Lee Roth era's weakest.Most reviewers have said this is a good album, but I found it to be bland and mostly unentertaining. Unchained was the only track that was memorable,Eddie's stunning axe work and Diamond Dave's personality can only carry an album so far,I love Van Halen, but I'm not going to give an uninspired album a good review just because of who the band is. With ""Fair Warning"" neither Eddie nor Dave came up with strong material to work with. I would only recommend this one for hardcore fans, and some of them may not care for it very much. New fans should try Van Halen,1984,5150,Van Halen II,and Best of Volume 1."
4,Van Halen gets funky y'all,"In Van Halen circles this is commonly known as the ""disco"" album as nearly half it's nine tracks are given over to funky dance experiments. Apparently lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen wanted to break from the hard rock formula of the band's first three albums and make the ultimate dance record. ""Dirty Movies"" has a great shuffling disco beat and is a good song to hustle to. ""Push Comes To Shove"" would not have sounded out of place on a Rick James or Barry White album and David Lee Roth holds his own against his funky soul contemporaries. ""Sunday Afternoon in the Park"" is the very first Eddie Van Halen synthesizer instrumental (foreshadowing his work on the 1984 album) and has a menacing vibe to it. The album's straightforward rock tracks include the flawless ""Unchained"", the underrated classic ""Mean Streets"" and the Grand Funk Railroad homage ""So This Is Love"". This is definately one of Van Halen's most eclectic efforts and a rewarding listen time and time again."
5,THE GUITAR ALBUM OF THE 80s,"This is the most underrated, yet one of, if not the best VH albums. Edward Van Halen displays some of his best work on this album and shines on songs like ""Dirty Movies"", Push Comes To Shove, and So This Is Love?! David Lee Roth is a monster , belting out lyrics to Mean Street and Unchained. A must for all VH fans and the prototype for all the hair band music to follow. Pure guitar, pure greatness. The fact that it contains ""Unchained"" is worthy of its purchase."
5,Serious- And Seriously Good,"FAIR WARNING is the most serious album that Van Halen ever made- and it's one of the best. Every note seems to be a warning that if you screw up, you'll lose your health and your looks. It is essential listening for anyone who doesn't want to wind up on the street or in the hospital. It may not have the pop appeal of the debut, 1984, or 5150, but it's a great cautionary masterpiece that I've learned lots from."
5,the quintessential Van Halen CD,"In simple terms: this CD rocks like very few other CD's in its genre. There is a darkness and playfullness that intertwine seemlessly. Without question, this is the best Van Halen CD.There is not one mediocre song. They flow beautifully together. The vocals and guitar work are masterfully done. A music collection would be lacking without the inclusion of ""Fair Warning.""In so many ways, this CD fully demonstrates the essence of Rock 'n' Roll. Van Halen was once the master of this art."
5,vh`s best,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST VAN HALEN CDS WITH GREAT TRACKS LIKE WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE,MEAN STREET,DIRTY MOVIES,AND MORE PICK IT UP"
3,It gets the job done,"Fair Warning is Van Halen's fourth full-length album that was released in 1981. Nine tracks are contained, and they are all satisfying. I also like the album's backing vocals. In regard to David Lee Roth, he is an incomparable, entertaining vocalist. Examples of compositions that I like are ""Hear About It Later,"" ""Unchained,"" and ""Sunday Afternoon in the Park."" The intro to ""Hear About It Later"" features nice guitar work from Eddie Van Halen with a pleasing timbre. ""Unchained"" displays a catchy main guitar riff from Eddie Van Halen. I was not expecting something like ""Sunday Afternoon in the Park"" when I first listened to Fair Warning. It is a cool keyboard instrumental that also exhibits drumming accompaniment from Alex Van Halen. The CD packaging does not have the song lyrics, but a black-and-white photo of the band is included, though. The CD is just over thirty-one minutes. Fair Warning is a recommendable album."
2,A dissenting opinion,"This is a mediocre album. Certainly Unchained, Mean Streets, and Sinner's Swing are exciting songs but the rest of the songs on this album are very poor by Van Halen standards. The guitar work is excellent, as always, but most of the songs are just not good enough to keep the interest going. Only for the hard-core Van Halen fan."
3,guitar whiz-kid could have used songwriter,"Eddie VH changed the way the electric guitar was and is played. The weak link is the songwriting. While better than the material on other VH albums (""beautiful girls""!? ""dance the night away""!?), Fair Warning suffers from this flaw less than anything outside of W&C 1st."
5,Amazing in every way,"I saw Ted Keegan perform for the first time not long ago and though I had seen the Phantom before his performance will always stand out. By the time intermission rolled around I knew Ted was incredibly talented, the entire way home I found myself reading and rereading his biography. I ordered his CD that very night and when I played it I was not disapointed. The CD is an true testiment to his talent, with the minimal backround you can really hear the depth and range in his voice. Any man who can get me to listen to a song like Sara Lee must have alot of talent and then right after to make me cry with Kiss Her Now WOW! All in all I wonderful CD the only thing lacking is a.... bad song!"
1,waste of time,The one star is because of a frustrating experience where the book arrived minus the deck of cards. So I have no idea of the quality of this item that I was so looking forward to receiving. Instead Amazon informed me the item was out of stock so I was out of luck. Prompt refund thus one star.
5,predictable perfection,"This is a great spyro album that diserves more credet than it gets,it is my personal favorite."
2,It could be better...,"This album could be better. The first song is pretty upbeat, but the rest of the album is dull. Definitely capable of putting you to sleep. Their follow-up, Stories Without Words, is much better."
5,Really Funny Show,This is one of those hidden gems from England. Very dark humor and very funny. My only problem is I have trouble making out the dialog with the thick accents. But at least I can replay the parts I don't understand. I highly recommend this off the wall show. And if you haven't watched CouplingCoupling - The Complete Seasons 1-4you need to check it out. It's a classic!
4,Nighty Night - The Complete Series 1,"Brilliant British comedy, Julia Davis left me speachless, the nureve she's got on her.I love her!!!I can't get enough and I can't wait for the next season.DVD's got some problems with playing on a laptop but works well on a regular player!DVD quality of item could have been way better than this!"
2,Not What I Had Hoped,"I usually find most BritComs enjoyable, and I think Julia Davis is hysterical, that being said, I found this show to be confusing and hard to follow. The humor was almost always offensive, and so I'm not so surprised that the show isn't around anymore."
2,Only ok,"If I got the choice to buy this over again, I really wouldn't. While it had funny moments, it was no where near as funny as what other reviews had lead me to believe."
2,Where's the funny part?,"I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks."
1,Worst DVD I ever bought.,"This DVD forced me to watch the advertisements for the FBI, studio, and about a hundred other DVDs. All the remote control buttons were disabled. It seemed like hours. My other DVDs all allow either the menu button, next button, or fast forward button to work. Not this horrible product. By the time I was allowed to see what I paid for, I was so irritated, that I could not enjoy the program.Next night, I tried to watch episode two. But, it tried to force me to watch all the advertisements again. At least the ""Open"" button worked. The only way to watch this ****, is to insert it before fixing supper. After eating it might be ready to show some entertainment."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"A lot of other reviewers have gone on and on about how much they liked this version of Godspell. I must admit, I am not in that camp. I was rather disappointed with the album. The new arrangements are often just plain WEIRD, and not at ALL respectful of the original score. The lyric updates, while, I suppose, appropriate, were unexpected and disconcerting on first hearing. I'm pleased to finally hear the Prologue/Tower of Babble on CD, but this version was a little outre for my taste. The grunge-rock tendencies of the arranger are not appropriate for the music, the lyrics or the story. I still think the simplicity of the original Off-Off-Broadway cast the best... but if you want an up-to-date version, try the 2000 Off-Broadway revival cast."
2,YIKES!!,"C'mon... this music is filled with computer-programmed drum and synthesizer parts that sound more like a cheesy $49 keyboard from K-Mart than like a group of musicians. There is no dignity left in the score here. If you want to hear Godspell at its finest, look for the British Cast Recording-- 1999 I believe it was. Exquisitely played by real people!"
3,pretty good,"For those of you who are used to the Godspell from the seventies, be prepared for a shock. I saw the updated Godspell in Boston in January 2001 with no idea what had been changed or updated. This show features all new arrangements and updated music stylistically giving godspell a year 2000 spin. I really enjoy tracks like Save the People, All Good Gifts and By My Side, but some of the new arrangements are so different that at first i didn't even recognize what song it was. I recommend this CD to new godspell fans and people just getting into musical theater, but die hard original godspell fans may be disappointed."
5,An amazing Godspell for the new millenium,"When I saw the show late last year, my jaw hit the floor from the begining of Tower of babel and stayed there until the end of the show. The music for this production is very updated and sounds amazing. All the vocals are outstanding. Tower of Babel and All good Gifts are particularlly well sung. If you love Godspell (or even hate older versions) you'll want to give this CD a try. It's brilliant"
3,A nice complement to the original,I am particular to the original cast recording just because that was the score I became familiar with after being in a HS production of the musical. Shortly after I bought this version -- musically and (in some places) lyrically it has been updated from the original. One great thing about this recording is that it is the only one (that I know of) to include the opening and tower of babble sections -- however I found it somewhat annoying that many of the philosophers lyrics are changed in the opening. Beautiful city is also a beautiful piece not found on the original. My favorite tracks were 'We Beeseech Thee' which has a gospel choir sound and a beautiful verson of 'All Good Gifts'. I also liked most of the dialogue sections were left in (like the middle of All Good Gifts and the end of By My Side).
1,See a community theater production instead,"I bought this cd wanting to love it. Acquaintence Joe Carney plays Jesus in this horribly-cast abomination of a fun musical. But even he is miscast to the point where I must wonder who auditioned for this show? To choose this lot of no-talents, the casting directors must have been faced with a very bad turnout. These kids can sing to the same extent that Brittney Spears can sing - well enough, but not well enough to be called good by any stretch of the imagination. Nasal voices, over-annunciation, and bad reading (it's not acting, it's reading) make me wish I had bought Godspell 2000 instead."
3,The reason to own this recording is:,I'm not gonna lie and say I'm really a fan of this recording...HOWEVER: This album is to Natalie Joy Johnson what the 1963 BEST FOOT FORWARD album is to Liza Minnelli. That's all I have to say.
5,5 up-to-date stars!,"My seven year old daughter helped me decide how to rate this recording. ""Godspell"" has been a staple in our household for several years now (especially since the release of the movie on DVD). My daughter and I were listening to this release of ""Godspell"" and she said it best: ""It's different...but I like it!"" She could not have been any more poignant. This recording has so much to offer. The cast is vocally strong and the revamped orchestrations are top notch. It won't replace my other recordings of this musical, but it is a welcome addition!"
1,WTH???,"Ok..first off, let me say I am jaded. I totally enjoy the movie soundtrack, and tolerate the broadway recording from the 70's (I actually think the Broadway production did a better job on Robin Lamont's ""Day by Day""). Yes, I own both recordings and it ends at these two.What were they thinking? They've ruined a classic; between the updated score, arrangements, and the voices being over-dramatic and filled with vibrato, the songs sound forced, and do not echo any of the fresh, happy, if not campy, sound of the original recordings.Some things are classics and shouldn't be touched. Remember when they changed Coca Cola and introduced the New Coke? Ya; enough said."
2,Disappointing,"I received this book as a gift from a friend who noticed my general interest in the origins of words and phrases. And indeed, I was happy when I first saw the title because I do find this subject to be interesting. However upon reading the book I was disappointed.I can't really put my hand on the reason(s) of my disappointment. It could be because of the fact that I was able to point out a few mistakes myself. It could be because of the complicated and unorganized fashion of presenting the information. It could even be because of the poor printing quality! Nevertheless, I was disappointed and did not find this book to be satisfying.It could be because I myself didn't have sincere interest in the subject, but I doubt that."
4,No problems,"Item description was dead on. If you are only needing one, get the longer cable, I can't tell you how many times you come up a little short on things like this, and just causes headaches for you. Have an old Canopus ADVC100 that I needed to connect to my new computer. Task completed, computers recognized unit, and was transferring video and audio without issues. My cable did have gold plated connections and was packaged in a Tripp Lite bag (I know other reviewers were complaining they received non-Tripp Lite cables and such)."
5,New Sondheim song is wonderful! Beautiful voice.,"This is the most interesting, unique and satisfying holiday cd I've come across. I've always been a fan of D.C. Anderson's but this cd stands alone as a truly great piece of artistic expression. And that voice! I love the new Sondheim Christmas song that he recorded. The sticker on the cd said it is the first recording of the song ever. He's one of the great ones."
5,What-would-DC-Dooo??,"DC, and all his music, is a treasure! He is the better than CATS, and WWJD. Buy now!"
2,"Capriciousness, not justice","Alice Hoffman is an incredible writer. Reading her prose is like snacking on strawberry shortcake. Each bite is rich, sweet, packed with unbelievable taste. I marvel at her abilities...However, this book has such a bleak point of view. It deals with incredibly weighty issues of sin, forgiveness, revenge, punishment...and it does it without redemption, forgivness, resurrection or even justice. There is an air of capriciousness about Hoffman's universe. The main couple in this book are ""punished"" because they love each other too much, apparently. It's like a Greek tragedy without the fatal flaw. One keeps reading, pulled in by the skill of the author, hoping vainly that something good will come of this tragedy.Some will protest that this is just like Real Life, and to some extent it is. However, most of us read fiction to escape Real Life, not to reaffirm it. We want stories that lift us from the muck and mire of the everyday...not plunge us neck deep into it."
2,Romantic imagery but little realism,"Can we really ever know anyone completely? Even the most loving and intimate partner of 13 years? Jorie, the protagonist of this lush novel, finds out the answer to this question, but she might have asked it much earlier, maybe at the wedding when his side of the chapel was completely empty. Hoffman is a talented writer, and I kept reading, with special interest in the sharply defined adolescent characters, but Jorie's ignorance about her husband's past is unreal and puts a hole in the plot too big to ignore."
3,"good quick read, but","I guess the good news is I was entertained and moved to read this pretty much straight through over the course of two nights. It has a good setup and the author can write a scene in the traditional chick-book kind of way. But it's all pretty superficial and it could have been a lot more. Questions about forgiveness, repentance, and retribution could have been explored much more deeply. Instead the book proceeds pretty much on the ""then she did this, and he said this, and she felt angry"" rather than any more subtle examiniation of motivation or exploration of inner dialogues. There are so many places where the writer essentially says, ""Imagine her horror!"" Well, I could, but then I could just imagine a whole story if I wanted to - the reason I read novels is to get a window on how the author imagines it."
4,Portrait of a Sociopath...,"I haven't read many of Hoffman's novels in the past, but I got through this one in a single evening. The perfect novel for a long plane ride! The main character is a classic sociopath; he does what he does because it's ""necessary"". Even for thirteen years' worth. The wife's character isn't fully developed in this story, so we don't know what she comes from or how she managed to stay in a fog for so many years. I would have probably though this a better story had more time been taken earlier on to present the cracks in this so-called ""perfect"" family. As presented however, Hoffman still manages to do a great job in showing what lives turned upside down can look like."
4,Hoffman draws you in,"Alice Hoffman is an excellent author...one of the few that makes you forget that you are reading a book and makes you feel like you are right there in the middle of the action. She also is in touch with what the human experience is all about...the large and small issues and daily battles that we all face. She is a master at character development.""The Blue Diary"" will stay with you long after you close the book. Hoffman explores what makes us who we are, and if the past can ever be forgiven or forgotten. It makes you think about our pasts and how they shape who we become.Hoffman is also not afraid to use children to tell the story, and at times, there observations can be the most true to life.Read this book and you are guaranteed a good read AND something to think about."
2,I didn't like it,This is my first book by Alice Hoffman and I just wasn't that crazy about it. I thought that it moved rather slowly at times and I really would have liked to have read more about Ethan's thoughts along with more dialog exchanged between him and Jorie. I thought that Jorie's character was a weak one and I didn't like the character of Kat at all. A disappointing read for me.
3,Ho Hum,"I listened to this book on tape and found the story an interesting concept, but the characters were quite irritating. I also was a bit annoyed with all the metaphors that Hoffman used in this book. Why is it necessary to compare the shinyness of the jail cell bars to a glittering lake. There were times when I just wanted her to get on with the story. I think the plot line is not condusive to her writing style."
2,Disappointing,"This being my first read by Alice Hoffman, I didn't know what to expect. Now that I do, I won't bother again. Blue Diary has an interesting story line, but in my opinion way too wordy and blah... I lost track of what she was trying to say simply because I had to return again and again to pull the facts out of (at times) excruciatingly descriptive sentences. If all her books incorporate the same ""wordy"" style, then once around is enough for me."
1,A waste of time and money!,"What a piece of junk! I had never heard of Alice Hoffman but decided to buy this book because it looked attractive on display in the book store. This taught me never again to be fooled by the words ""New York Times Notable Book.""I tend not to read fiction because so often the plots seem utterly implausible to me. This one wins the prize for implausibility.Ms. Hoffman needn't worry about my ever again reviewing one of her books. Pffft."
4,What a wonderful book!!!!,I truly loved this book!!!!! I read it in 2 days and I must say...Alice Hoffman is truly gifted. I loved Kat and Collie and have to wonder if Alice Hoffman is an animal lover!!!! What happpened to Ethan was unfortunate...however...he did make his bed...so now he has to lie in it.
1,her most boring book,"I have read a number of Alice Hoffman's previous books. Loved a couple and liked 'em all. Not this one. Trite handling of serious subjects. Bad writing and worse characters. I read a third of the book, skipped to the end and skimmed the rest, looking for something in this book to like and never found it."
1,"be warned, leave this one on the shelf!","If you read this review and buy this book anyway,don't say I didn't tell you. I was so dissappointed. I just read 'Local Girls' and loved it. This is a book about a man who is discovered to not be what he has says he is for the past 13 years. One minute his wife and child love him more than life itself and the very next it is absolutely over. That's a little to cut and dry for real life. But, that's not the worst part, there's at least two more books inside this one story that I had rather hear about than this one! Last but not least why does Ms. Hoffman think she has to write a 'Travel Guide' for New England. She tells about the weather, the birds, the flowers and she does this over and over and over, etc. I read a review before I read this one but I decided that they had to be wrong. I'm sorry to say they were not. Don't waste your time!"
2,Nice try but no cigar,"Alice Hoffman has hit upon a great idea, but the story lacks the depth and fullness of a well-crafted novel. Its trite attempts at poignancy are contrived, and the character dialogue and thoughts have the luster of a wood block. Some of my favorite novels are ""unbelievable"" and that's what makes them great (e.g., Tom Robbins' Jitterbug Perfume). Blue Diary, in contrast, is the kind of unbelievable that prevents the reader from getting lost in the story. Instead, I found myself distracted by the preposterous, although intriguing, premise. Perhaps a more creative novelist could have pulled it off."
3,Not her Best,"I love Alice Hoffman, but I did not love this book. ...Ethan Ford's downfall, or rather, attempt at redemption is not brought into any clarity for the reader. There is no reason this atrocious man turned good overnight. The book does hint that he truly is not a redeemed man, but so what? I did not care about him at all, and found his wife's action inevitable and not surprising. There was no magic for me in this book. A quality that I have always loved about Hoffman in the past. The book consisted of too many cliche characters with no in depth exploration. An evil man caught, trying to save himself. A destroyed wife, trying to ""understand"", an angry son, a vindictive and jealous little girl, the beautiful but ill best friend who ends up with the nerd from high school...the only interesting person was the victim, and her brother, who do not occupy enough of the book. All in all a disappointing read."
2,Uninspiring,"This is my first Alice Hoffman book and may be my last. Her writing style rambles and switches points of view so rapidly I felt whiplash coming on. Her main character, the murderer, is so despicable when we initially see him commit his crime that it is quite unfathomable for us to think he has ""changed"" so much. The premise was enticing, yet the story and characters never really developed. Hoffman's writing style is to switch viewpoints every chapter, yet I felt jipped that we weren't in Ethan's point of view longer, if not to help us understand this great metamorphasis we were supposed to buy into. I don't think I'll read another."
1,Blue Listener,"As a daily commuter, I listen to audio books and have found them a pleasant and enlightening manner in which to spend the time.When I picked up Alice Hoffman's Blue Diary I was expecting the title to have significant meaning as the plot unfolded. I was sorely disappointed. It was no more than the hormonal musings of a teenaged girl that revealed no impact on her untimely demise or on her murderer.Why the reference to no reflection in the mirror if it is never to be followed by an accurate or believable explanation?Perhaps the enchantment with this particular author comes from reading rather than listening to her work but I will not hurry to check out another Hoffman audio book."
2,Very superficial treatment of characters,"The storyline was unique and interesting (a woman suddenly discovers after 13 years of marriage a horrible secret that her husband has been carrying), but the treatement of most characters in teh book was superficial and at times, even vague. I was left with the feeling that Alice Hoffman thought of a storyline, and hurriedly assembled characters around it without giving much thought to how people may actually think or behave in a situation like this. I was disappointed since there was a fair amount of hype surrounding the novel."
4,"Thank you, Alice Hoffman!","Alice Hoffman's latest work, BLUE DIARY, is haunting. The plot centers around Jorie Ford, wife of the nearly perfect Ethan Ford, and her life in a small town in Massachusetts. When the flaw in Ethan's past is exposed, everything changes for everyone. I read this fast... I didn't want to, but it was so compelling... Hoffman is an excellent writer, and the stories she tells in this novel ring with truth and honesty."
5,Stepping into a painting,"Reading one of Hoffman's books is indeed like stepping into a painting. Although you ""read"" her books you also soar through and above them. I really loved this book, and couldn't put it down. She writes of such painful stuff and yet the humanity of it all is so real, you can't help but feel clean afterwards. You'll be thinking about human nature, forgiveness and the ability of time to change all of us long after you're done reading."
2,Lost me in the middle,"I'm not a big fan of Hoffman but thought she would redeem herself when I began this book. The storyline was intriguing and she pulled me in from the beginning but lost me in the middle. The story seemed to sag, leaving me wondering what the point was to it. Maybe Hoffman lost the point as well in the middle. As for the wife of Ethan going to visit the brother of the murdered girl, PLEASE! What was that about? Talk about FICTION, that would NEVER happen. All in all, I was very disappointed in this book, although Hoffman's poetic writing is beautiful."
4,"A bit ""literal"" for me, but parts were beautiful....","Reviewers were right that the flaw in the book comes withJorie's ignorance of her husband's past, or rather, denialabout the fact that he comes with no past at all. It is not plausible that a woman as smart and ""with it"" as Jorie did not ask more questions about this stranger she fell in love with...at least, over the years. I can see her falling for Ethan as a girl, but into her more savvy thirties? And you would think her even smarter friend, Charlotte, who was there the night Jorie met Ethan, would have squeaked up at least once with the question, ""But where does he come from?"" or ""Who are his parents?"" However, there were many charming, heartbreaking moments in this both lyrical and literal book...I particularly loved the part about Charlotte and Barney finding each other at such a difficult place in their lives. It's also rather interesting...the whole idea of one's""perfect"" life being turned upside down due to a dark secret."
4,"Another ""dreamcatcher"" hit for Hoffman...","Hoffman sucks you into the passionate, sensual, but very private lives of Jorie and Ethan, two of Monroe's most loved residents, whose lives are about to be shattered by a haunting past.It sounds like an old story, but Hoffman characters, insights, and ironies are drawn so insightfully, you won't recognize it. Part of the story is projected through the eyes of the thirteen-year-old neighbor girl whose revelations are so wrapped up in normal teenage angst, she, and the reader are kept wondering if they are true. When she sees the same lack of conscience and the same selfishness in her slightly older sister as she sees in the man she believes is a vicious, soul-less killer, the neighbor girl draws the reader into her struggle to understand and come to terms with her own identity.As in her other books, here Hoffman displays her ability to draw the reader into the enviable lives of people we want to be...and then exposes us to the realities of our fantasies."
1,A big disappointment,"I expected an interesting, unexpected plot, page-turning novel, something the back cover had described... I haven't read any of her other novels, so I thought I'd give this one a try. I was looking forward to the page turning experience. What a disappointment. I turned the pages often in search of a good story. The plot was trivial, the characters one-dimensional, and the flowery prose did not fit with the story.Honestly, this book read like a well written essay from a high school student. The text was overdone, and it seemed she was reaching to create the book into a ""poetic prose"" style novel.The forever-mentioned lilies really killed it for me.Try another novel, don't waste your time on this book."
4,Thought provoking and engrossing,"This is not the first Hoffman novel I've read; I always enjoy her. Blue Diary keeps you reading and I like that. Her prose is poetic and her characters well drawn. I'm not going to recite the plot since that's been done in numerous reviews before mine. I just want to add that I think the strength of the novel is that by looking primarily at how other people see Ethan, Hoffman is able to perform the magic of slightly tilting our view, so that the man we saw in Chapter one is not the man we come to know at the end of the novel. The author correctly keeps us out of Ethan's POV most of the time. This is not really his story. He doesn't really change and that is the real surprise that Hoffman has for us. This is the story of the ripples from something he did 15 years ago and how these ripples affect so many people in his world today. I think Jorie made the right choice in the end."
3,Needs to be edited,I just finished the Kindle version of this book. The eBook contained so many typos that I found it extremely distracting to read. Stick to the physical book for this one.
4,Mystical read,"There is something about her writing style that draws me in to her plots, and this book was no exception.I really enjoyed the little twists and turns she took the readers in this particular book. The one thing that I felt was missing was her ""mystical"" element. She did have the black birds, but I didn't find them to add the mystical touch that is in most of her writings."
1,Shallow characters ruined this book,"The plot was not the most original, but it was the depth (or should I say lack of depth) that really tanked this book. The main character of the story is hardly explored, nor was the son who was also a key character. When I finished reading this book, I felt nothing for any of the characters. Sorry Alice, I will not read your work again!"
3,Thoughtful topic,"Why did so many people dislike this book? This is the only novel of Alice Hoffman's that I actually enjoyed. I thought the topic of redemption was a good one and the idea that someone may not really know the person they married an interesting notion.The only somewhat annoying parts were the constant use of the present tense, which got on my nerves. In the beginning I enjoyed the description of various flowers and trees in the Massachusetts countryside, but it became too much like a travelogue.The really unrealistic part was when Jorie called the victim's brother and he allowed her to come over. This seemed completely out of line, especially when his personality was described."
5,ART OF SURVIVAL,"I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR 1 SONG-BROKEN BOTTLES-AWSOME TUNE AND GAVE THE CD A GOOD HONEST LISTEN A FEW TIMES THERE ARE SOME GOOD INSTRUMENTALS LIKE CUT 5, CUT 10 VERY NICE ANOTHER GOOD CD BY BILL MILLER(IN SHORT ANYTHING BY HIM YOU CAN'T GO WRONG)....."
5,A Beautifully Illustrated Picture Book,"The pictures in this book alone make it worth the cost of obtaining it. There are also many useful diagrams available, notably the one which illustrates how plate tectonics is believed to work, and the world map which shows known or suspected sites of large extraterrestrial impact craters. There are also rather picturesque reconstructions of certain dinosaurs."
3,Texas Moon and Beneath a Neon Star in a Honky Tonk,"'Texas Moon' and its companion volume, 'Beneath a Neon Star in a Honky Tonk are devoted to work Tommy Duncan recorded without the support of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys. These fifties records were originally cut for labels like Capitol, Fire and Intro and while Duncan is in good voice throughout, some of the material is insipid and only some of the backing combos hit a swing groove. There's a great ear opening version of 'Hound Dog' and a solid 'San Antonio Rose' on 'Neon Star' and 'Texas Moon' features the excellent 'Gambling Polka Dot Blues', 'In the Jailhouse Now' and best of all, 'Wrong Road Blues' , sung by Tommy's brother Glyn. Good liner notes, presentation and sound but unfortunately at least half the tracks fail to register as western swing."
5,F-16 Aggressor,"This F-16 Flight Sim is without a doubt, the best one that i have ever played. A nice effort was made in the terrain models, and the aircraft detail. It seems to be at the addition of a convincing cockpit or realistic flight. Yes Sir, did love it, every bit."
4,Aggresive review,Yes its true that F-16 Aggressor is not the best flight sim out there but good on the British for giving it a go. Although the Editorial review was almost feeding the Brits to the lions just think where the U.S Navy would be if it wasn't for the Harrier Jump Jet THAT THE BRITISH SOLD TO THE AMERICANS get off there back.as for other flight sims the Americans have made anyone inside of America would think that Ameriaca Won WWII single handedly (they didn't sorry to say)it was a joint effort by allied countries and if the japanese hadn't bombed the Americans would not have joined in the war to help liberate the world. anyway happy flying and good Hunting
5,exceptional,"I read the series as a young girl and have been searching for the entire series in antique book stores for years. Although she may seem too sweet to many people, you must remember when this book was written and for whom it was written. The ways in which she overcomes her problems, which may seem simplistic to us, are really an example of how we must turn things over to powers higher than us. Really a series with great moral stories."
5,My Favorite,This is my all time favorite book. I love this book because I am a christian an Elsie love Jesus just like I do. If you haven't read this book yet please do.
1,it would take a heart of stone not to laugh at little Elsie (apologies to Twain!),"Pity Elsie, the human dishrag. She weeps. She mourns. She trickles. She drips. She emobodies all the 19th-century feminine virtues...she's selfless, obedient, trusting, martyr-like, beautiful, etc. And to modern eyes, she's dumb as a brick, and considerably more boring. She's a saint-in-training with no personality or backbone.Although reading this was rather entertaining in a train-wreck sort of way (and was so over-the-top as to be funny), I would never recommend it. PLEASE don't foist this off on children. You may frighten them into never reading again. There's a reason why the majority of positive reviews here come from people who are not actually children!"
1,Not my favorite,"Ugh! When I first started to read this book, I thought it was exciting, what with the unjust punishments inflicted by Miss Day, the governess, etc,. Unfortunately, it got very sappy very quickly. I for one cannot stand goody-goody heroines. Yes, it does sound charming--a wonderfully angelic girl, but one must not go overboard."
1,Literary Child Abuse,"I read this book because a friend said it was her favorite in childhood. I was horrified. In brief, it is the story of a child who is taught to be the worst kind of martyr, abused physically and mentally by her hideous father, and who never contradicts nor stands up for herself. THE PERFECT CHRISTIAN CHILD? No. A little insufferable masochistic prig.Anyone who encourages his/her child to read these Elsie books has a screw loose."
4,good book,"Elsie Dinsmore is a good book to read. She is a little girl who lives in the 1850-60's, that time period. She eagerly awaits the day when her papa comes home, but is extremely disappointed when he does arrive, and doesn't like her. Elsie's grandfather had told Horace (her father) that Elsie wasn't a very good girl, so she isn't loved. Elsie's father is not a drunk, as some might think, but he is VERY harsh with her. Even after she wins his love, he is very strict, and isn't very indulgent; he is very careful about what she eats, wears, the kind of parties she goes to, etc. Elsie IS sometimes a 'goody two-shoes', but she's ok. I really like this book, and have the first five! It is really good."
2,Really?,"This book was a lifeless bore. Elsie, the main character, was a perfect little righteous angel who cried when she was happy sad embarrassed or angry. Not that she ever really got angry. This book annoyed me because I couldn't relate to Elsie at all. A perfect beautiful angel being abused and tormented by everyone. The. At the very end wins her fathers love. That's all that was gained. It was a log sad book file with boring speeches and preaching. And crying. Lots of tears. Prepare yourself for a tear-jerker."
4,A review of Spyro Gyra's Spyro Gyra.,"Spyro Gyra is a well-rounded Spyro Gyra record. It was their debut album. It originally appeared back in 1976. This cd conveys a great mixture of sounds and is quite unique 70's Spyro Gyra. For being their debut album, this cd is really quite good.My 3 favorite tracks on this album are 1,2, and 4. Shaker Song is their first song and it's great and has an extraordinary melody to it. OpusD'Opus is also a great track featuring a tight drums/percussion solo. Pygmy Funk is a strange, but good song. Strange is good, right. Throughout the whole cd there are great melodies and many different parts and sounds.This is a good debut album by Spyro Gyra. It is a must for your Spyro Gyra library. It's a classic. However, some of the end songs can get minorly repetitive. All in all, it's a nice cd worth the purchase. The cover art is interesting as well. Thank you for taking the time and generosity to read my review."
3,"Not a bad debut album, but they get better later.....","Definitely not their best work. There are some good songs on here but their next few albums improve greatly. If you are new to Spyro Gyra, buy ""Morning Dance"", ""Catching the Sun"", or ""Ingognito"" but not this one. This is not a good example of what the band can do. They are still wet behind the ears on this one."
4,In The Beginning!!!!!!!!,"There's not that much to offer here on this release. In fact, I think I can safely say, if I was around when this cd came out, and I listened to it, I wouldn't really be looking foward for their next release. I basically wouldn't be a Spyro Gyra fan. Luckily, my first album was Collection, which featured top notch Spyro Gyra, and I heard how good Spyro Gyra actually was. Perhaps the only song on here that went on to be a Spyro Gyra standard is Mallet Ballet, and maybee Shaker Song. Some of this album reminises their Carnaval album. Opus Do' Pus, I think. I wouldn't run out to get this cd, but rather just get it to complete your collection."
1,A waste of money and time.,"Barring better judgement, I purchased this book. Most of the titles in this series are god and informative, but this one is so far off center, I cannot recommend it.His solutions are absurd and have no practical application in the ""real world"" and are educational theory at best.Don't purchase this book, don't recommend it - I want my money back!"
4,"""The Black Cat"" segment is also ""Cask of Amontillado""","Vincent Price & Peter Lorre have great fun in ""The Black Cat"" segment which also intertwines the plot of ""The Cask of Amontillado""- Price's Fortunato insults Lorre's Monstressor by sleeping with his wife, who gets walled up with Price and... well, there's where even more fun begins!""Morella"" and ""M. Valdemar"" are also good scary fun, but it's ""The Black Cat"" that makes the show. Alas, I have not yet seen ""Twice Told Tales""."
4,Cliches?,"These reenacted Edgar Allan Poe stories are surprisingly scary especially `The Case of M. Valdemar'. It's about a dying man who is in a lot of pain. Valdemar makes a bargain with a hypnotist that if he'll help relieve the pain he'll allow him to keep him alive past death in order to tell him what he sees on the other side. The acting is a tad overwrought, after all Vincent Price stars or co-stars in all three sketches, but they bring out the horror of the situations. Peter Lorre is at the center of `The Black Cat' and provides a little bit of humor. In my opinion `Morella' was the weakest of the three tales but still entertaining. The only problem was that Price and Lorre are so unique they have almost become clichés."
2,Does not compare to Cliffnotes and Sparknotes,"There's about 8 pages of BS in the beginning of this PDF file that has little or nothing to do with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Then there is the summary of the plot, but there is no analysis of each act. There is good analysis of the themes, symbols, and historical content. But the overall quality of this PDF file leaves much to be desired. The text is highly distorted at large resolutions, and it even changes color at times for inexplicable reasons.Will someone create a Cliffnote or Sparknote for this play, already?"
2,Soledad is not working for me,I bought Soledad. I've not quite found the right combination to make it pop for my coppery-brown skin tone. I do like the smell though...
5,Es la misma historia de siempre,"Leer la saga romana de Colleen McCullough es leer la historia de hoy , observo a traves de ella que nada ha cambiado. Lo atractivo es que parece que la autora hubiese estado alli ,que lo que cuenta a parte de los hechos historicos es real. Demuestra conocer la psicologia de cada personaje."
5,Good Starting point,Once again this book from Course Technology teaches you the step-by-step approach. It is well-written and suitable for a junior DBA embarking on the journey of Oracle PT. I will definitely recommend this book.
5,Best PSA sandpaper hands down,"3M gold PSA sandpaper is by far the best for woodworking. It seems to last significantly longer than other brands, has a much more even abrasive grit size, and just the right amount of adhesive. Also the backing removes easier than other brands making it easier to use. I have it in 80, 250, 220, and 400. The coarser grits seem to be the best value. I highly recommend this product after having spent less to try other brands and been quite disappointed."
5,"hey, why don't you guys go down to the gym and...","Great flic, Funny stuff. Buy it, Rent it, See it, Whatever.""Mooooon River, Phew... thank you doc."""
3,Meh,"While this holds a special place in people's hearts, it really is a mediocre film. Chase's one-liners are funny at times (I did pull-over before, I'll pull over later) and other times complete miss-fires (I'm not talking nodoz or cough syrup, I'm talking the hard stuff). The movie, while not the best, can be watched again and again and has garnered quite the cult following. The bad thing about this edition? The absolutely horrendous featurette that features more of some guy who worked on the DVD trying to round up cast members and worrying about himself than it pays attention to the movie itself. What a terrible terrible feature."
3,Classic Chevy!,"I bought this as a gift, but have seen the movie several times. Classic Chevy Chase. I love the different characters he plays and wonder how much was just him - totally unscripted."
5,Comedic genius,"A pure gem, comic gold from a once great master of the genre. It may not be an exact interpretation of the source material but Chase' take on it is simply superb. I hear tell they are doing a remake and while I'm not surprised nothing will ever sully the memory of this gem."
3,Fun Times,"Chevy Chase is funny, great story and movie. It just lacked enough funny moments. A good cast and this movie help chase a lot. I would definitely recommend for a chase fan."
4,Chevy Chase at his best! Fletch in widescreen! :),"I have loved this movie since it opened and was thrilled to get it on DVD. I was totally impressed with the DVD transfer! Faltermeyer's score pounds out with unmistakeable 80's synth sound - even better than on laserdisc. And to finally see Fletch in widescreen was a treat as well. I know there are those who hate it, but I have always been in that growing minority that loves to see films the way the director intended us to see them rather than have 1/3 of the picture cut out for us to fit our TV screen. If you are a Chevy fan, this is a GREAT DVD!"
3,Fletch,"I think this is one of Chevy Chase's better films. I don't like his movies where it is just one personal disaster after another. He is a hero in this movie, not bad."
1,DVD would not play,"I was so excited to get this DVD, Fletch is one of my all-time favorite comedy's. However, when we got it, we didn't watch it right away. We waited until ""family night"" when everyone decided we needed a good laugh. Put it in the BRAND NEW DVD player aaaand....nothing! The player said it was ""Unable to read disc"". We tried EVERYTHING. We put in several different movies and they ALL played, so it tends to make me think that the movie is defective. Glad I didn't pay a lot for it. But now, I'm on the hunt for the movie again. VERY disappointed..."
3,not great,"I don't give a damn about what other people say about it, but I don't think that Fletch was that good. It had some funny parts but not perfect whatsoever."
4,Chevy Chase as Fletch,"Chevy Chase fans will love this movie. Although it can be a little slow in some parts, it'll keep you laughing throughout. Of course, if you like this one, you must also get Fletch Lives."
4,Excellent Chase,"HD DVD version has best picture and sound I have seen for this film. Picture 4.5 stars, Sound 4.0 stars. Movie 4.0 stars. As much fun as ""Who's Harry Crumb."" One of Chase's best films. Chase holds his characterization throughout the film and has an excellent supporting cast. Make some popcorn, sit back and enjoy this one for what it is - entertaining shtick with a script."
3,Fletch,"I love the movie fletch so when i saw it a such a great deal, i jumped on it. The problem is that the seller failed to tell anyone that it is not of American format. I think the movie is great but i think the seller needs to be a little more clear on their products."
3,Good Sarcastic Fun,"If you like Chevy Chase you will definitely like this movie. If you liked Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop you will probably like this movie. Chevy plays Irwin Fletcher an investigative reporter trying to get the scoop on how drugs are being distributed at the beach. He plays his sarcastic style to the hilt and the story is good enough to make it one of his better movies. It is more serious than the ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"" that he did and yet still has plenty of humor. You get to see him expand his acting capabilities beyond his normal goofy Clark character in the Lampoon series. The supporting cast may not be outstanding but they and Chase are interesting enough to keep you tuned into the movie. I even like the running Fletch movie theme. Not as snappy as Axel F but still good."
3,A Realistic View of a Classic,"Fletch has long been one of my all-time favorite movies. It's hip and fast-talking, doesn't play to a dumbed-down audience, and never ceases to crack me up, no matter how many times I see it. At one point, I had pretty much the entire movie memorized, and still probably know most of it.But let's be realistic. Fletch is a hilarious movie -- a cult classic -- but it's not without its flaws. It's filled with great one-liners, but the script runs roughshod over Gregory McDonald's plot, obscuring it. Could the adaptation have been better? Maybe, but it's doubtful that would've made it a better movie.Looking objectively, it's just not a great film. Looking subjectively, it's one of the best comedies ever made. This is one you just have to judge for yourself."
5,best movie ever,this product came on time and was everything that i expected. I could not be any more happy about this product
5,Paging Dr. Rosen-Rosen!,"This movie is an all-time comedy classic. Thsi movies ranks up with Airplane!, Caddyshack, Blazing Saddles, Slapshot, and Austin Powers as one of the greatest comedies in the past 25 years."
2,just ok,Not any better than grocery store hot chocolate. Found it had an odd taste. Have not had the restaurant version to compare. would not purchase again - def not worth the money
2,Wasn't at all what I thought I was ordering,"Returning for refund, because the text says ""...As Seen on Oprah! Gift Box Includes: -The beautiful 20 oz dessert glass from the Serendipity restaurant-Two 6 oz packets of Frrrozen Hot Chocolate Mix (each packet makes 30 oz - delectable drink for two!)-A Serendipity spoon -Two straws (in case you choose to share!) Everything you need to recreate the restaurant's #1 all time favorite world famous dessert drink at home.""I thought this was all inside the canister, but it's not. It's a canister of mix, but includes no gift items.Frustrated, because usually Amazon product descriptions are very accurate!"
2,It was ok,I guess I have seent this many times on tv and etc .. i think its overhyped fro what it was and we are all underimpressed.
5,Devilishly Good!,This was a gift for my brother and sister-in-law and they said it was positively EVIL...which in my family is the highest praise a dessert can attain. We will probably give as a gift to someone next Christmas as well.
2,Just expensive hot chocolate mix,"The drink was tasty, but this is just expensive hot chocolate mix. Overpriced for what it is."
2,Not Chocolate,"This stuff is just a powdery waste of money. I won't buy it again, ever. You'd do better with packets of swiss miss..."
3,Serenditpity 3 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate Mix Canister,"This product was advertised on Oprah as being something to try before you die, which is why I tried it. I was expecting it to be really good, and I was disappointed in it. Maybe it would be better at the location in New York. It is very rich and it is good, I just wouldn't describe it as something to try before you die."
3,Pretty Good!,This drink is pretty yummy! But I dont think i will spend the Money for it again! Just wanted to find out what the hoopla was about! I think I rather go to starbucks for my Frappachino for the $..and I dont have to makeit myself!
1,COMPANY Doesnt care about sales,"I Ordered this and waited for two weeks--NEVER recieved it. I Emailed and asked where it was, and said if Not shipping soon, cancel it. They Cancelled it. Obviously Not in stock and this COMPANY doesnt care about sales. No attempt to send it to me. I will Find it elsewhere I guess. This was for the cannister."
1,Construction DVD,This item looked like a dvd box with a dvd in it but unfortunately it was only a disc and a little truck in a box making it hard to store with other dvds because it doesnt have a case. Had I have looked more carefully and saw the truck I would have never ordered it.
1,Just turn off the volume.,"An effeminate man in a hardhat (a ""genie,"" calling himself Hardhat Harry) lures two young boys away from their neighborhood, promising construction site adventures. Say what????If that's not enough, the dialogue and voice-over are painfully bad.But... my son loves watching the diggers. So I just turn down the volume on the TV and turn up the volume on the CD player instead."
4,Not as good as the first edition,"The first edition of Martin and Barkley(1961)was a tremendously useful volume and this newer edition is simply a reprint. The main problem with it (and reason for only four stars) is the photo quality is very poor compared to the original. I've made photocopies of the original that look better than those in the current edition. I was dissapointed by that, however, the book stands alone as there are really no other references like it. If you can obtain the earlier edition at a reasonable price I'd recomend that you get it, but if you can't this adequate."
2,Why did I finish this book?,Usually I don't finish books that I'm not enjoying or getting something out of. I just never got into these characters or had any sympathy for them. Could be because I am happily married and believe in the sanctity of marriage? This book was a dud...outdated and not particularly entertaining either.I gave it two stars because I tend to grade high.
5,Lunch-Box Latches,"Looking for 'Lunch-Box Latches' for your Hot Rod, Street Rod, Retro Rod? These will fill that need. The Bright Brass plates well even without polishing; I opted for Nickle, bright Chrome would look good too. I bought a supply for my '28 Ford pickup and a few spares for 'project-next'."
3,To teach rhyming,"We use this as part of a text series to teach rhyming. It is good for that. I don't really get the ""story"". I have to admit that I have never noticed the page where the firefighters are so interested in the blond. I guess I need to look at it more closely this year. However, since I've used it for 4 years and have never noticed it, I'll bet my students haven't either.Update (Oct 13, 2006) - The version of this book we use is not the same one (with the offensive illustration). I guess this one might not be advisable. My students do love the rhyming text."
3,"Please review your reviews, this isn't the book you say!","Please pay attention! The book ""Fire, Fire said Mrs. McGuire"" by Bill Martin Jr. and Vladimir Radunsky is not the book to which amazon has attached these two reviews. These reviews refer to another edition of the book. Also, almost every comment is directed toward the OTHER edition of this book. Bill Martin's book features not a blonde woman, but mice and kitty cats. Please be conscientious of what you write. This is fine book for children."
3,The reviews are going to both versions of the book,"I have found the problem. Amazon is publishing the reviews in both of the pages, the Richard Egielski illustrated version with people in the city with a helecopter on the front (and blonde woman inside) and the one illustrated by Vladimir Radunsky with the cute mice inside. Clearly they are different books with the completely different illustrations. Keep that in mind."
2,Fire! Fire! Said Mrs. McGuire,"The rhyme and story in this book are so much fun to read, they would keep young children asking to read it over and over. However, I do not feel I can use it in my classroom because of one illustration. A sexy blond is using her body to get what she wants from firemen-very inappropriate for young children! Bill Martin, please bring back your original version of this wonderful book."
3,Lacks Color Images,"The narration of this book seemed to be very useful and well researched, however, even though a great number of her paintings where present throughout the book, I would have preferred them be in color instead of black and white illustrations. That was most disappointing."
2,too much text,I love Alice Neel's work. That being said this is a book that offers more text than images. If you know nothing about her background then this is a great book. Since I was already familiar with her biography I was disappointed to not see more of her work and also wanted to see more of it in color(a lot of photos were black and white).
5,Fresh and Fun,"Justin Hayford's recordings of wonderful standards (that someone forgot to make standard)is a joy to hear. I love standards, but how many recordings of any one song do you want to own? Here is a raft of songs mostly new to me (and that's hard to do). Especially liked ""You're Awful""Thank you Chicago for sharing Mr. Hayford with the rest of us!"
2,"Great vacuum, flimsy construction","The vacuum is powerful and does a great job. The door that covers the accessories, however, is flimsy and the hinge breaks easily. The spring loaded button that must be pressed to extend or retract the metal portion of the suction hose never did work right and eventually that broke too. I replaced that part and viola! Now it works great. It must have been incorrectly installed in the first place and shouldn't have passed quality control inspection. The power to the retractable cord mechanism failed after only two years. The repair company stocks these parts because they fail pretty frequently. I expected higher quality for the price of this machine."
4,It is a good game,"If you like hunting but are afraid to kill real animals then this is the game for youm it is very realistic and has great graphics, it has lots of equitment and different weapons you can use. It even has a trophy room so you can display your trophies it is a very good and realistic game and has a great price to go with it."
3,Mcfadden & Whithead,"Nice album for old time soul music. These guys really only had one big hit ""theres no stopping us now"" and it is the best song on the album."
3,great group,i to am interested in getting the disco or longer version of aint no stoppin us now.please e-mail on where i locate this and many more old school songs.
1,I've been hosed!!!,"I needed an industrial-type hose and thought this would be the perfect ""leak-free"" hose to use indoors where you can't afford a cheap leaker. It was said to be made in the USA too! (it's a sad testament to our quality control.) It is plenty thick - a good feature, but the connectors are thin and cheap. As soon as I unwrapped the new hose and installed it I connected a trigger sprayer. I turned the water on and got a shower from the poorly done crimp on the female end. There was no way to stop the leak and it was a gusher. Rather than sending it back which is a bother, (and I know Amazon would make it good) instead, I bought a brass hose repair kit(which cost more than the hose) and fixed it. I'm afraid this was one of those products that was assembled with shoddy workmanship...be warned, it's probably like our American automobiles - there's likely a lemon in every group."
5,Anglo-French espionage in the twilight of the Venetian Republic.,"The Anglo-French Vicomte Marc-Antoine de Saulx arrives in Venice on secret mission from the British Prime Minister to save the Venetian Republic from being annexed by Napoleon. In order to accomplish his task, he must play a dangerous game of double agent, while at the same time attempting to save his former betrothed from being sacrificed on the altar of international politics.Although seldom read or discussed, Venetian Masque (1934) is nevertheless a fine example of Sabatini's later works. The writing style is mature and even (despite a somewhat abrupt beginning); the plot and dialogue are sophisticated, with plenty of action, twists of fate and international intrigue. Like most of the author's works, it is difficult to put down.A lesser known novel, but still showing Sabatini at the height of his powers. A must-read for fans of the author."
3,"Fair and balanced, but not particularly interesting","The book provides a good description of Milton Hershey's life - his early struggles, his later success, the Cuban sugar business, his generosity and the building of the community in Pennsylvania and his relationship with it. Unfortunately, Hershey gave few interviews and wrote little so everything is one step removed and heavily filtered by the Hershey public relations machine. The author does a good job trying to dig for details and paint a balanced picture, but in the end the picture of Milton Hersey is blurry and the story is not engaging."
1,Factual errors and innuendo,Some interviews were with elderly people who apparently were answering leading questions by the author to juice up his book. Some of us life long residents resent this.
4,Hershey...and much more,"this book had all the information need for my report....but then it had like a lot more information on America industrializing, other people of his time, etc.****IF YOU NEED A FAST BOOK THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU!its very very long..... so it was ok"
4,Well-priced and decent quality,"This is a fantastic, solid scraper that is comfortable to hold and use.It's total length is 230mm (9""), and the handle itself is 140mm (5 1/2"").A slightly softer grip would have made it perfect, but it's still very comfortable.The metal has a satin finish and is about 2mm thick (1/16""), so it's very sturdy and will not bend or flex.It takes standard single-edge razor blades, which are clamped on with a gnarled phillips head thumb screw.There is no blade guard, but the razor blade can be reversed during storage so it's not exposed.The quality, especially for the low price, is very good.G'Day from Australia."
1,Not a good product,"This cable does not work for my setup (new Windows Vista) with an old Epson printer. There was no instruction on what to install. The ""auto launch"" feature of the CD did not work on Vista. After 1 hour of trying different drivers, I gave up. It was relatively cheap so I didn't bother contacting the vendor."
3,HP 712 won't work,"The cable has to connected directly to the printer, not to the old printer cable. My new Windows 7 PC recognizes the HP 712 (using the generic HP 710 driver) but nothing will print. It appears the driver that worked with XP doesn't work with the 64 bit Windows 7. Other old printers may have similar issues."
1,Cable is too short !!,"beware, the cable on this is only 3 feet. your printer must be right next to your PC/laptop and on the appropriate side in order to connect to your preferred USB port. There is a reason the price is so low."
1,calbe did not work with my new computer,"Cable is well made, but unfortunately, it did not solve my problem of making my HP4 laser printer work with my new computer that uses Vista. Suspect it is a lack of Vista compatible drivers from HP that is the source my my problem. So the cable will go into my box full of things I no longer need. Too bad,."
1,Did not work,"I bought this product to be able to connect my HP LaserJet IIIP to my Windows 7 computer (had driver installed on machine). Cable FAILED and nothing printed. I am an IT student so I am familiar with how it works (or should work for that matter). If you are using this cable for Windows 7, DO NOT BUY! If using Windows XP, buy at your own risk. I would suggest going to a retailer like Micro Center and pay a little more for a better quality product."
1,Sadly Dissatisfied,"Sadly I could not use this equipment. The connector cord was much too short, and I could not make it work. I would have returned the item, but the shipping was too much. If anyone wants it, contact me."
2,"Great voice, boring album",I'd heard Nita Whitaker's voice was amazing so I eagerly bought this album. What a disappointment it turned out to be. No doubt she is a very fine singer with great range and control.But the songs are so incredibly insipid that any vocal accomplishments are greatly diminished. The songs lack originality and do nothing to enhance her formidable voice. What a pity.
5,Well Worth IT!!!,"This is a great program. It does all that it promises. I'm only sad that I discovered it so late. I have purchased at least eight other ""first"" grade programs, but this one is by far the best. There is so much to do,yet your child is not overwhelmed. All the games are fun, my daughter especially likes the barnyard music keyboard and the storybook in the reading room(sort of a play on the mad-libs of old). Children do not have to wait too long to be rewarded, 'smart-stars' are given out generously.Since this is an older program, it may be somewhat difficult to find. But if you can, buy it! It will not dissapoint."
1,There's only 1.,"When I read ""2 count"", I am lead to believe that there will be two of these. But there is not. The cleat itself is fine. But the name is misleading and quite honestly, annoying."
2,Look elsewhere.,"Obvious, redundant, dated. Those in search of the jazz tradition would be bettered served by earlier texts by Marshall Stearns or Martin Williams."
3,A Step Down,"This album was the first of lackluster albums by the O'Jays. This one was a little understandable because of member William Powell becoming sick and later dying in 1977. So sad! From this point on the group would never be the same, even though they were able to last. This record did have 2 powerful songs(""Message In Our Music"" and ""Darlin' Darlin' Baby (Sweet, Tender, Love)""). I love the latter, it was the first 45 record I ever owned, but the rest of the album seemed to lose the direction that the last 4 albums had. Maybe it was because music was pushing more disco than ever before, who knows, but this was definitely a step down for the group."
5,They Don't Make 'em Like This Anymore,"Socially conscious, historically in-tuned, and, (ahem) REAL INSTRUMENTS AND HARMONIC VOCALS! Nobody--and I mean NOBODY--did it better than the O'Jays. The album title and cover lets everyone know what music meant to the inner city people of the 70s and where exactly we got our intense love of music. Where did the 70s go? WHY did the 70s go? What happened to my Schwinn Stingray bicycle with the banana-shaped sparkle-flake seat? (sigh). Peace to all the children of the 70s, wherever you are!"
5,One who loves good soul music,"This CD compilation is a rarity. It has Messsages that are positive and it is good music. My favorite track is ""I want you here with me"" This song and others are one of the reasons why I bought it.Second of all it is classic and timeless soul music that can hold it's own aginst any R&B song of today.Not even Boys2Men can make people get up and dance like the O'Jays music still does.By the way my age is 29. And i prefer Classic R&B over what is out now."
2,Gem,This band would be a ghost right now if it weren't for the fact that Trent Reznor was in it at some point. Any huge fan of Trent (Nine Inch Nails) that digs around will eventually find this.
4,Nokia DT-1 MUSIC STAND is a hit.,"I purchased the Nokia DT-1 Music stand and it has a very nice sound for such a small unit. Also if you don't want to hear your phones radio, you can plug in something else.Kinda expensive. But you won't feel you wasted all your money!"
4,Improving my health conditions,"Getting back into exercise is more difficult when you are 63 and have severe arthritis plus an total knee replacement. After participating in the dance exercises, my blood pressure, cholesterol and pre-diabetic conditions all improved to the point that my medication for hypertension has been lowered and I have been kept off of medication for cholesterol and diabetes! This video delivers in so many ways and being critical of people enjoying life is missing the point. It still seems to be the case that those who criticize people dancing are the ones who don't have the courage to get up and dance themselves. It's not about competition, it's about fun!"
3,So-So,"I've been working out for a long time and have many of Billy Blank Sr. videos. This work-out is OK. In my opinion it's not quite bad enough to resell, but not good enough to put on the top shelf of my work-out favorites. Instead I put it on my ""last resort"" shelf - the one I go to when I just want something a little different.The choreography is interesting, but a little challenging if you aren't used to a 'dancey' work-out. It took me a few times to catch on to some of the moves, and I have a lot of dance videos. The Disco and African segments are easier and more fun than the Latin one which I found to be difficult to follow.""The wife"" was the most annoying thing in the whole video. Billy Jr. was OK - accept that he called her ""wife' instead of addressing her by name which I found to be a little condescending -the work-out team was entertaining and upbeat but ""the wife"" was a little too animated and seemed to be trying too hard to be cool."
2,I really wanted to like this dvd....,"I have a dance background so I ordered this thinking it would be fun...it is a decent workout, I was winded during the dvd.There always seems to be someone that is annoying to look at and the lady in orange is IT. I get dvd's for the purpose of getting a workout, not to watch someone who seems to be auditioning for ""Dance Fever"". I am an avid Jillian Michaels follower and find that I appreciate her more focused approach to exercise. At the end of every session (I did love the African dance section), there are a few seconds where the dancers do a freestyle type dance and it seems more audition-esque than workout-esque and I found it to be very distracting.I am sure that there are those that will thoroughly enjoy this dvd but it was not for me."
4,Great!,"I thought this workout video was fun and very easy to do! Some other ""dance"" workout videos are too difficult to keep up with and the instructors don't give good directions for the moves. But this video was so simple and a great workout! Highly recommended!"
4,Groove and burn,I really enjoy this dance workout. It really works all of the body. I would recommend it to friends and family.
4,Billy Blanks Dance with Me Groove & Burn,"U was looking for some reasonably priced dvd to help me diversify my exercise routine. I work from home and very sedentary, this allows me to take a quick break, complete a session and beat the afternoon sleepy. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to add diversity to their exercise routine and a fairly quick workout with great results."
2,Bored,"I love a good work out - goodness knows I should - I own over 100 work out videos.I saw Billy Blanks Jr. on Shark Tank & know he's Billy Blanks son - whom I LOVE & LOVE all of his Tae-Bo workoutsI had high hopes for this.I was so bored out of my mind.The steps were basic & didnt even get my heart rate up. The final part on final dance routine, for 2 minutes was the only heart pumping thing of the whole workout.I actually yawned during it & my husband even said, ""You look bored out of your mind""I wear a heart rate monitor & my heart rate averaged 108.. that's how bad it is.I'd give it lower - but will say, the 2 minutes of basic arm burns was the only workout I received. & that's even without weights. But it still was a good arm workout."
1,How do these crappy films continue to get made?,"Watching this film was borderline painful. I could see where M. Clancy was heading but his lack of directoral expertise just glowers throughout this film. I chuckled a few times, but I chuckle at work too and get paid for it. The wince factor during ""heavy"" scenes where acting is required is high, making this film completely unbelievable even with a healthy suspension of disbelief. Also, M. Clancy, if in the odd chance you're reading this, the last time I checked, re-writes were not against the law.If your soul is in need of a character study with a funeral backdrop, rent or buy Lawrence Kasdans classic ""The Big Chill."" You'll be much better off for it."
2,Not as good as expected.,"I rented this movie tonight, having vaguely remembered the trailer from 2003. The synopsis on the box was intriguing enough, although I realized the potential for a hackneyed portrayal of an all-too-common family comedy theme. I was hoping for a cleverly-written dark dramedy along the lines of a Charlie Kaufman or Wes Anderson film. What I experienced was a trite presentation of your textbook dysfunctional family.The film had its moments, but those moments were far too rare. There was little in the way of character development; in fact, the character who experienced the most development was the dead one. As screwed up as this family is, I felt no sympathy for any of the characters, and I couldn't bring myself to care about their lives even a little bit. Even the big revelation at the burial service, perhaps the most interesting moment in the film, was somewhat of a ho-hum moment.I really had high hopes for this one, but in the end it just fell flat for me."
5,Possible the funniest Comedy Movie this decade,"It has only one competitor so far ""Air America""..But Air America cannot stand repeat viewing...I can watch this movie every 4 months and still bein stitches......This is definately a ""Mans"" comedy...Women will not find it as funny as most men!!!But in my opinion it still remains the funniest comedy of the first decade of the new millenium.PS Why doesnt Amazon have a spell checker and different fonts/size fonts???"
4,Absolutely amazing! Totally woth it!,"This has become one of my favourite movies of all time. When i first heard of this movie, I didnt think it was going to be anything great. I was completely wrong! This movie has a superb cast, very well-rounded. The movie is hilarious, especially if you like dry humor. Run, dont walk tot he nearest video store and rent it! You wont regret it!"
2,Don't bother,Nothing original here. Nothing overly humourous. Overall pretty bland in my opinion. The only part I thought was really worth watching was when the casket exploded at the end.
5,Archetypal Reiki,I used this in a reiki training class and so enjoyed it that I bought one for myself and have used it
1,The Worst,"About as bad as a movie can be. This thing must have even emptied the rural drive-ins it was clearly made for. As for the presence of the great Basil Rathbone, this is an object lesson about what selling out can lead to in the end."
4,Old style Country Music Excellence,"Not much of a story line, but the talent is worth the money for the DVD. Picture quality is excellent and sound is also high quality. Much better recorded than ""Road to Nashville"" (Similar style movie. Dont ya just love Merle Haggard, Ferlin Husky etc.. Donna Browne"
1,Country and Western Horror............oh my,"Unbelievably bad mismash of country corn and horror humor. Country and Western singer stop at an abandoned manison, and you can fill in the rest with out watching the movie. I like comedy and horror, but this is a bad combonation. This movie doesn't get a rating. It should be a negitive 1 star"
1,"Oh Mr. Rathbone,what happened to you?","How sad to see such a great actor such as Basil Rathbone in this crap after all his great films of the thirties,maybe it was personal financial troubles that forced him to accept his role in this movie that is so bad that it makes Plan 9 look acceptable."
1,Hillbillies in a Haunted House,This movie is the worst piece of dribble ever filmed. Waste of money!!!!! HATE HATE HATE!!!! Don't buy this crap!
4,Great indie film about teens and coming of age,"Movie was a lot better than I expected, I actually bought it because I lived in Baton Rouge (where this was filmed) and was an extra in the movie and thought maybe I'd see myself somewhere, haha. I am totally in 2 scenes!! haha awesome. And, to boot, the movie is actually pretty good, though I feel the ending is a little weak I liked the rest of it. I also thought Justin Chatwin's character should have had a bigger plot role, he's a really nice guy in person and a pretty excellent actor. Eva Amurri did a great job, and Willa Holland is so beautiful it's hard not to own this just to see her! It's on netflix, give it a watch, especially if you enjoy films about weed ;)"
5,"Fun, fun, fun until you solve it and have to buy another game.",My 4 year old girl loved it. She was able to navigate it herself and stayed motivated to rescue baby animals and return them to their parents and habitat. Of course we'll be onto the next Putt Putt game.
5,Great Game!!!!!!!!!!,"My four year old daughter loves it! She played it over and over again. She still goes back to it now and then. You learn about animals, the puzzles are chalanging but fun, and there is a guest spot from other Humongus characters. Learning can be fun. Go ahead and buy it. You and your kids will won't regret it."
5,This is a Great game for children of ALL ages!,"This was the first childrens software I bought for mykids. They loved it! I must admit, I love it also. This is anexcellent interactive game. Now my 3 year old is addicted to all of Putt Putt and Freddi Fish games. He especially loves the songs that are everywhere in the game.You must see this game to experience it. Children love the bright colors and great sounds. There are differences in the game each time it is played. My 5 and 6 year old occasionally play along with my 3 year old. I recommend this software to anyone with children. The price that Amazon is selling it for is Excellent. You will not regret it, and your children will thank you!"
5,5-1/2 Stars for Putt Putt,"I'd like to rate this higher than a 5! In this game, you have to search around the zoo for 6 baby animals that have wandered out of their respective pens/habitats. So you also have to click on things to collect and play games along the way that will help you in your search. My son is 2-1/2 and the guidance says Ages 3-8 for this game, but I really enjoy playing it with him and teaching him to have fun ""figuring things out"". Although, I also enjoy watching him sit here at this computer (very recently) in his booster chair so he can reach the mouse comfortably and do all the moves and clicking and rescuing all by himself. Pausing at the parts he really enjoys (like eating cotton candy at the vending cart just inside the zoo entrance). Great Game - and also I highly recommend Putt Putt Travels Through Time. Enjoy your kids!!!"
3,Simpler than Circus or Race.,"As a mother of 2 and 4 year olds and an adventure game lover myself, I only give this 3 stars because the game is less complex than Putt Putt Saves the Circus or Putt Putt Enters the Race. My 4 year old finished it in <2 hours, with a little assist. This is just right for my 2 year old, who doesn't mind playing it over and over. The animal narratives are beyond them, though."
4,Great Game!,"My son just borrowed Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo from a friend. The game sends the player on an adventure through about 20 locations divided into three sections of the zoo. In each section, the player locates baby animals who require items found in other locations in the zoo to rescue them. While it may seem that so many locations would be difficult and time consuming for a young child to navigate, the layout is straightforward and each location has a distinctive look.My only complaint is that my 4.5 year old initally saved all of the animals with an hour. Unfortunately, the challenges do not change from game to game. You always find the same animal in the same location and use the same tools (found in the same locations) to rescue him/her. That said, my son still loves challenging himself to see how quickly he can get through it now and there are a few cute little hidden games within the game."
4,Good game to own,"my daughter is 5 and she loves this game. It requires thinking and also has fun games. The first time I had to help her getting all the tools and babies, now she only wants to play on her own. The best part is that it is a short game, can be completed in less than an hour!"
2,Very poorly written,My 3 yr old grand sone likes it but I have to set up the video resolution before it will work. All of these games seem to be written by different people and none are very professional.
2,not the best,"This book is really easy at straying off the topic. The writing is choppy, unsmooth, and tries and fails to keep the book from being put down. Reading this gave me a headache and I had to put the book down every 5-7 pages or else my head'll blow. The story plot is really bad and the romance on a scale of 1-10 (1-bad 10-good) is probably a 3. This book is probably the worst Smoochya book ever. If you want to read much much better Smoochya books, find the author KATIE MAXWELL."
2,No info on smaller islands,I went to the island of Tavenui (third largest) and the book had no info about that island.
3,"Some good, some not so good","While some areas of Fiji seemed to be covered fairly well, the sections on other areas had not been updated since at least the 4th edition. One example of an area inadequately covered is the island of Taveuni. There were hostels in Lavena where the book said there were none and small and sparsely stocked stores on the north end of the island where the book said there was a large and well stocked store. The opening of the hostel and the closing of the food store both occurred at least a year before the publishing date of the book."
5,great cd.,"This is an old album by Karla Bonoff that i somehow overlooked. Really good material, I highly recommend it to all."
5,Looks great in my bathroom,"I really like this style so I bought the set. I highly recommend the Moen Danbury line. Quality, well made product. Just picking them up you can feel that they are made right."
1,towel ring,"I returned the hook because I was not happy with the color.I wanted a true bronze color, not black."
2,Color is off,"Our whole bathroom is done in oil rubbed bronze and somehow this doesn't match. The color is dark & flat. Would not buy again - if I could return it I would. As far as quality, it's sturdy."
3,color not correct,"This is a nice looking towel ring, but it isn't really oil rubbed bronze! All the other items I have that are oil rubbed bronze are brown with a copper color showing through, this towel ring was just solid dark brown, and it didn't match the oil rubbed bronze toilet lever I bought from amazon either. So if you are looking to match other items that are ""oil rubbed bronze"", you won't be happy with this, I had to return it because it clashed with the faucet I had."
5,Very pleased,Ordered this and the toilet paper holder and am very pleased with both. Nice finish and both feel very heavy and sturdy. Exactly what I was looking for.
3,picture not accurate,The finish looks mottled. It looks more black than oil rubbed bronze. I returned it. It was certainly very disappointing
4,looks good,don't like how it attached to wall looks like pic and works well so far no problems with this product
3,Average at best,"Frogger for the now generation... it leaves alot to be desired. The mini games are nice diversions but are wicked hard as the difficulty ramps up rather quickly. The main portion of the game has awkward control issues and is too stretched out by the silly storyline. In a game like this, you really just want to get to the game part instead of reading endless dialogue between the characters. For kids, its light on violence, has decent graphics and once in the swing of things, has its moments of amusement. There are many worse titles on the market, but also many that are far better."
4,Stormy Memories,This music is relaxing and beautiful. A none DTS CD would be more versattile for my other stereos but I love and cherish the music above any inconvenience.
4,Bravo Freccero!,"One of the most original text's in the north-american tradition of Dante studies. After that must be red ""The Undivine Commedy"" by Theodolinda Barolini..."
1,This bio seems contrived.,"I find it very, very hard to believe that anyone, especially a small woman, could drink to the degree that Laura Baugh did and not sustain liver damage. She also says she abstained during her pregnancies...did she know the instant she was pregnant? I think not. I guess writing is an easier way to make a buck than playing golf."
2,Flawed analysis?,"Griffith overlooks several key battles and ""fudges"" with some numbers to come to his conclusions.His discussion of the infantry firefight left me wanting and his writing is difficult to read.In the end, I found nothing new revealed that I didnt already know."
3,Hard Work,"I tried cleaning the black streaks from my white haulmark trailer and while it does take off the black streaks, to make it look good you have to rub very hard. It has taken over half of the bottle to clean the front and 1/2 of one side. I probably have 6 hours into it and my arms are sore!"
2,Didn't work for my RV,"I bought several of these and sprayed my travel trailer, let it soak and brushed it- and it pretty much did nothing. I ended up at the RV dealer paying $65 for another product that did work but only if I super concentrated it above what they recommended. maybe it would work if your steaks are newer but I bought my RV from someone so maybe they haven't cleaned it in awhile, so that could be why it didn't work. If you have a lot of streaks and they have been there awhile, I don't think this is the product for you. Its just not strong enough, do what I did and get a concentrate cleaner, add hot water, and put in a few times more then they say to dilute it until it starts to work."
1,Childish,The book does not answer questions women need for their hysterectomies. It is not a practical health guide
3,A little too cute,"There is good information in this book, but I found it wearisome wading through all the saccarin fairy tale stuff. Women who have had hysterectomies are referred to as 'punctured princesses,' and answers to basic questions often take the form of cute-sie fairy tales. I just found it all a little much to wade through, and not at all funny."
4,Information and sisterly emotional support.,"This book seems to be addressed to one's inner child, and was comforting when surgery was approaching and I was feeling nervous. When I first started researching hysterectomy surgery and alternative treatments, I wanted straight-forward facts and statistics. At that time, this book did not appeal to me. Later, as surgery approached, reading this book was like getting a gentle hug. This should not be the only book you read when deciding on a hysterectomy, and when choosing what method of hysterectomy."
4,Through the Land of Hysteria:,"This is a great book for the gal who has apprehensions about a hysterectomy. This book really helped me be more prepared about what to expect before, during and after the procedure.It is written in a ""lighthearted"" way, so as not to get bogged down in terminology or trepidation. The information is entertaining AND accurate. Reading this saved me lots of calls to my doctor with questions or concerns."
5,There's a Killer Web Site that Goes WITH this book,".... which I REALLY appreciated; when told I needed a hysterectomy, I was freaked out and immediately went to Amazon to research books. I chose Dr. Streicher'sThe Essential Guide to Hysterectomythen found this one; but then learned that the author was the founder of the AMAZING web site for women, www.hystersisters.comThe web site was EXTREMELY helpful. Between the web site, the book and Dr. Streichers advice, I decided not to have my hysterectomy, at least not now. I owe it ALL to being able to learn from other women, especialy those on hystersisters.com"
4,hyst or miss,"A good book if you need to feel pampered, can be annoying if you are looking for real info, and have to read through fantasy stories of pillow police and kings to get to the info. Leads you to a wonderful website where real info and follow up emails of expectations and week by week progress. Not a difficult to read reference. I highly recommend this for the ""just after discharge"" reading. But, you will need more substance for deep questions on hormones etc."
5,Funny and informative!,"This book is full of interesting stories and useful information for anyone going thru a hysterectomy! I bought it after spending many hours at the website reading posts from women like me who were scared and trying to gain some control and insight into the surgery that threatened to change their lives forever. I can't tell you how much that has meant to me. This book is the website condensed in paperback, it travels easier than a PC and you don't have to plug it in! It will make you laugh and cry and say ""hey!, thats ME!"" The lists for what to take to the castle (hospital) with you, and list of do's and dont's when you return home (as a punctured princess) are great. Best of all are the stories of real women telling about their experiences traveling thru the land of hyster. God Bless the HysterSisters!"
4,Great Product,"This is a wonderful product for someone who is not into scrapbooking,to me that is a waste of time. This product allows you just add your photos and print, and it has a scrapbook appeal. The only problem that i have found was trying to reprint a book that i made in 8x10 into 5x7 mode and that was only the front cover and i couldnt spend alot of time on figuring out how. This really gives someone who puts their pics on the computer to have the ability to just click and print, but print a whole book. For me wouldnt have my sons first baby book done.I hope this helpsRose"
3,no room for creativity,"The idea of this book is great, but there is no room for creativity whatsoever. If a page has space for 11 photos, you have to put in 11 photos. If you like the layout, but only want to put in 9 photos, it won't adjust itself. If you're supposed to put a date somewhere, there is no room for more characters than a date would require, and it is not adjustable. You want to move a photo up a bit, out of luck. I got so frustrated using their software, that I will be doing most of the layout work (except the cover) in Adobe Illustrator, which is obviously more flexible, but will require more of my time. This is for someone who likes to be told how to design their custom-designed book."
1,"Good idea, bad software","I really liked the idea of this product, and they have some good templates, but after putting hours into designing the book and writing up captions, I printed it and the pictures looked HORRIBLE. The software resizes the images automatically to fit the layout, but for some reason leaves the pictures pixelated and fuzzy. I took the pictures with a 6MP camera, and they look great when viewed on the computer or printed with other software, but when this software resized them they came out terrible. And there's really no way around it, except to try to guess the proper resolution for each photo and crop and resize yourself before inserting the photos, but that would take several more hours.This product wasted hours of my time and left me very disappointed."
2,"Easy to use, but incredibly limiting","This kit is neat; I have to admit that. It comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book. However, the kit itself is a little pricey considering that A) there's only 10 pages, B) the pages are only 5 x 7, and C) the pages are not double-sided. The software included, although as simple and easy-to-use as can be, is so limiting, it doesn't actually feel like you have made this book yourself. Instead, it's as though you're in preschool, bringing in the pictures and having Teacher put it together for you. You can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please, but there is seldom the precise one that you really want. It doesn't help that half of the themes have these cutesy ""scrap book"" elements that look absolutely ridiculous.However, the book itself is pretty slick once you make many, many comprimises. The only reason I gave this two stars is for the materials included."
5,Wind At My Back,This is a wonderful DVD series. Great for the Family. It is wholesome entertainment.I wish there were more Sessions in the series.
5,A real gem,This book was in beautiful shape and was quite a bargain for all the information it provides. I was very pleased with this purchase.
4,Good as it was almost 40 years ago!,"Season 7 was delivered to my door yesterday and I was surprised to find that they added an small extra. ""Sisters at Heart"" contains the original opening and closing remarks by Elizabeth Montgomery. This probably hasn't been seen since the original broadcast in 1970 because the sponsor, Oscar-Mayer, is mentioned and the logo is in the background. It was nice to see that they added an extra, finally. I'm hoping Season 8 might have some outakes, the E! True Hollywood Story of ""Bewitched"" or an interview with Erin Murphy and/or Bernard Fox!!"
1,NO SARGENT ACCEPTED AT ALL.,"Nothing personal, but, really, no Sargent accepted at all. His appearances made this show lost all the magic."
5,Review,Film stock isn't as sharp as previous years; no fault of the DVD. However Samantha looks great in the short dresses she wears throught the season. Makes up for it.
5,Bewitched,"More fun and comedy with our favorite witch. Sit back, relax and have the kids watch some clean fun with a moral now and then."
5,Great shows!,They don't make shows like they used to! This is the last season of Bewitched. I have purchased all seasons and still wish there were more.
3,Good for a No Limit album,"I have to say that the production stepped up a notch on this album. C-Murder did ok for a No Limit Soldier. But it isn't good enough. Still talking about gold chains and (...). That ain't coo no more. The only thing I liked about the album were the beats. For the most part, they were a lot lot better than how they use to be (except the Kane and Abel CD's. they had better beats.).In general this new No Limit really is terrible. They rid of Mystikal just to replace him with somebody that sounds like him. They get some white boy that tries to sound black. And that fake Tupac guy makes me sick. the one person I only like there is Mia X. However, C-Murder did ok and is coming up. By next album, or 2 C- Murder will make his mark on the South. Ya herdz me. A ""MUST GET""~?? For all yall southern rap fans. Get this. For all you No Limit fans, you know you gotta get this. Everybody else~?? Take the risk if you want. It's a Toss up."
3,i don't know,"well this is not c-murder's best cd, but no limit is still trying to hang in there, glad to hear mia x back after 3 years, but wonder what p was thinking when he hired t-bo, p is now taking notes from dre now."
4,No Limit still strong,"I had my doubts about Cp3.com but I took the risk to get it. When I first heard it, I said I wasted my money. After hearing it a second time, I said this CD is kinda tight. The beats are tight. I was happy to see Mia X back in to it. Now there are new No limit soilders such as Slay Sean, T-Bo who sounds like the No Limit Mystikal, and Ms Peaches. My favorite tracks are ""What U Gonna Do"", ""U Wanna Ride"", track # 11 (I forgot the name), and ""Down for my B's"". I also have My World My Way by Silkk and his album is pretty good also. Cop both of them, you won't be dissappointed."
2,wrong category,"This is more by way of advice than a review and the content of it is to say that ""SUGAR COATED BABY"" is listed under the wrong Frankie Miller. Frankie Miller from Glasgow, Scotland recorded THE ROCK and HIGHLIFE, however ""Sugar Coated Baby"" was recorded by an American guy who sang country along the lines of Hank Williams."
5,Mother of 4,My son enjoyed this book very much he is a big history buff he enjoyed it to ways first the book is old to him and also and read about how the telephone was invented.
2,sticky and not very moisturizing,"this product does its job of coating your hair which may prevent further breakage. However, it is too sticky and doesnt do much in terms of moisturizing. It smells good though."
1,Terrible experience,"I followed the directions as the bottle said. I am Indian, and I have thick curly hair. This product SMELLS HORRIBLE. it makes your pillows and your towels stink for 2 days. It continued to smell bad after i washed my hair. oh and the best part, my hair is exactly the same after the treatment."
4,No more Relaxers,I put relaxers in my hair for years and it caused so much damage to my hair. This product worked as stated. I can now go to the gym and sweat and my hair stays manageable and straight. I have very thick curly hair and I am so glad I found something that gets my hair straight without causing permanent damage.
2,Not as good as other Organix shea butter conditioner I've bought,"I've bought Organix shea butter conditioner in the past. It is great for my daughter's curly hair. However, the bottles I ordered from here seemed watered down. I went and bought another bottle at the store, and it was definitely better. I would not order this conditioner from here again."
2,hate how it smells,"I love the idea of vanilla scent but when the package came, I was so excited of using it. The smell is overpowering and it gives me headaches."
1,I wish you could give a product 0 stars!,"This product is worthless. I have medium curly, long coarse thick hair. It did absolutely nothing. Now I was not looking for a full blown straightening treatment. I am not that optimistic from a 15 dollar version of what costs hundreds at salons. However I was at least hoping for a little bit of a smoother look as I live in a very humid area to which my hair reacts poorly. I followed the directions exactly, vague as they are regarding ""over saturating"". My hair, which is auburn colored (natural), is horribly dry, it is also still just as frizzy and has a definite lighter look to it, which luckily I do not mind as my hair usually lightens to this color by the end of summer so it really just gave me a head start. HOWEVER I do mind the dryness. My Hair was impossible to brush through for the first few days after. I have used other Organix products in the past and loved them. This one I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Stay far far away!!!"
2,Not for gray hair,"I put this in my mother's hair 3 days ago. Her head is entirely gray. When I flat ironed it after putting the product on, it turned a yellow-orange. We were hoping it would wash it but we washed it last night and it is still the same color. Her hair is soft and much straighter, so I feel the product does work. But, if you have light hair, I would NOT use this. We have not come up with a plan for her color yet."
1,Disappointment,"I have very coarse, curly hair. I bought the suave keratin product, saw it was recalled, and looked for another product. This had such great reviews that my sister and I both decided to give it a try.The result: nothing. My hair is the same. If you squint with one eye while upside down, it might look slightly less frizzy. I'm not impressed. I've been using the ever straight shampoos too. Oh well worth a try, especially at this price."
4,will ruin your dye,"I had my hair dyed blue (manic panic blue mayhem semi-permanent dye) and after straightening my hair with the treatment on it my hair turned orange. This product does straighten hair very very well, but it will RUIN your hair dye job, beware."
1,Did nothing,"No change in my hair texture, but my flat iron only goes to 410*. I have thick wavy to kinky curly in the back."
1,"Not damaging, but DID NOT WORK","Followed the instructions and spent 2 days with this stuff on my head during which time of course, my hair was straight.(Blow drying your hair straight and then hours of a flat iron will do that lol) I have shoulder length curly hair, but not black hair and not super thick. I used about half of the product. I didn't think that the product smelled bad in any way, nor was I panicked by excessive smoke from the flat iron. My hair stayed straight, non frizzy and soft during the 48 hours but as soon as I washed it it went right back to curly.My hair was darkened slightly by the product but not damaged in any way. Since I received 2 boxes as a gift, I might do it again using a little less as a leave-in conditioner.As a curl remover it didn't work at all."
1,Would NEVER recommend it!!,"I heated the process, the smell, and am very dissapointed with the final results. My hair even feels drier. I felt sick by the smell. I would never use it again or recommend it to anyone."
3,Blondes be careful!,"Used this product, yes leaving it in for 48 hours was a little gross. But after that I washed it out I did notice more defined curls without product which was great! Usually just frizzed with no product. However, this product did turn my blonde hair very brassy and at some parts orange! I didnt use a high heat thankfully so my hair did not turn bright orange however I do have to dye it tomorrow to try to fix it. All and all, if you have brown hair go for it- blondes, not worth it"
1,my hair is now orange,i used this product today as it was recommended to me by a friend and after flat ironing realised that it totally changed the color of my light blonde hair to a unnatural orange hue. Very upset to say the least. Please do not use this if you are a blonde!!! it doesn't mention this anywhere on the product information.
2,so greasy,I did not get the right product and the one I got left my hair so greasy I will not use it again. I ordered the oil for my split end mender which I love and can't find in stores anymore. Instead I was sent the anti-breakage serum.
1,NOT safe for color treated hair,"I have blond highlighted hair and was very careful to read over the encloded instructions for this product about color treated hair. It clearly states that it is safe for highlighted and color treated hair. It turned my hair orange!! It is not safe for highlighted hair and I have just read several other reviews with the same concern. Why has this company not disclosed this, yet when obviously it is a problem."
1,I had a major allergic reaction! Not worth it!,"I was pretty excited about this product because I love the Organix Brazilian line of shampoos and conditioners. I followed the directions and as I was blow drying my hair, my eyes began to really sting. After I straightened my eyes immediately began to water. After just an hour or two my eyes were dry, itchy, stinging and watering and now my nose was sniffly. I decided it can't be good for me if it's doing this to me so I washed my hair after just 5 hours. I'm afraid I'll never see if it would have worked, but it really did a number on me. I must add that I do not normally suffer from any type of allergies besides the occasional seasonal allergy. This stuff is NOT good for you, I would stay away from it!"
1,Turned my blond hair yellow!,"I have white-blond hair, and during the flat iron stage of this process, the very first strand I tried turned bright yellow. Disgusting. Unfortunately, it was right in the front of my face, so now I have to re-color that section. I'm completely disappointed!!"
1,Did not work for me........,I bought this product after seeing reviews saying that it straightens afro hair but it did not work for mine. I followed the directions and waited longer than 48 hrs to wash with the shampoo. My hair is still in an afro and frizzy. It made my hair softer and easier to comb thru but that's about it. I still have half a bottle left but I think i might go to the salon to get a professional treatment.Update: Ordered QOD max keratin system and my hair looks and feels great!!! My hair felt like silk after washing with organix it felt like straw!
2,makes my hair feel hard.,not a fan of this product. At all. It makes my hair feel hard and crispy and full of tangles.
1,I USED to be blonde...,"Wow, I feel like such an idiot...I had already shampooed and applied the product when I decided to look up reviews. I am a blonde and started to freak out when I saw that others were reporting brassy and orange discoloration after using the product. I decided that my hair still looked bright & blonde, so it was probably some fluke on their part. I was even happier when, after blow-drying my hair, it STILL looked shiny, straight and still immaculately blonde. Fantastic! Until I started in with the straightening iron. I was almost in tears as I saw my hair change from gorgeous to brassy & tacky. This product may work, but it's certianly not for anyone with light hair. I am extremely disappointed that it states it's ""safe for all types of hair, even color-treated & highlighted"", when it's obviously not. Now I have to deal with hoping that I can return the crap to get my $16 bucks back so that I can turn around and pay someone to fix my hair color. Terrible product."
2,Not for highligted hair,"I follow the intructions, i did it at night. The result was straight greasy hair, i thought that maybe the next day i could use the flat Iron a little bit more and that the hair will absord the product at night but instead, because of the smell i have nightmares of smeling fumes of fire, i woke up and it was the smell of my hair. Next day the grease in my hair look like yellow dandruf, so i just wash my hair and my highlighs turned out orange. Now my throat hurts i think it was the fumes of the product while i was using the flat iron because i felt a bitter taste in my mouth while ironing my hair the night i used the product. In my personal experience i won't recomend this product."
1,Run away,"All I wanted was smooth, soft hair. What I got was heavy, stiff and hawaiian tropic smelling for 48 hours. Then when I washed my hair it smelled so bad I got dizzy. Instead of smooth, soft hair, I got coarse, fly away and smelly. There is a reason people pay $150 for this treatment. Don't waste your time and don't risk your hair."
1,Awful.,"I have thick, brown hair that is prone to drying out and frizzing. This product actually made it worse. It certainly ""mended"" my hair by making it sticky. The only good thing is it smells good. Other than that, it made my hair even frizzier and it tangled more than before."
3,No keratin,"I just bought this from the drug store and was checking the ingredients for formaldahyde. I noticed that there is no keratin listed in the straightening treatment. As a matter of fact, all the great natural ingredients promoted on the box, are only found in the pre shampoo packette. This may work, but not due to keratin. This makes me suspect that all the keratin treatments rely more on their chemical base than actually infusing your hair with keratin. I gave this a 3 because, it might work, but I am returning mine, but people should know before they buy, no keratin in the treatment."
5,This stuff is wonderful! !!!,"I am an Africa America woman with normal hair. I had a relaxer for 20 years. I went natural about 3 yrs ago. I still used a flat iron to straighten my hair. I heard about Keratin from a friend at work. She went to a salon and paid $150 for a treatment, I purchased this item and received the same results. My hair is silky straight. If you would like a straightener that is not a chemical please try this product. My hair has NEVER been this straight and manageable. It is as simple to apply as conditioner, blow dry it with a brush and then finish off with the flat iron. It is well worth the price. Please, please try this if you want straight hair. Happy am I."
3,TOOK AWAY HIGHLIGHT COLOR,"THIS PRODUCT IS OK, BUT , I HAD HIGHLIGHTS DONE RIGHT BEFORE, AND THEN THIS PRODUCT TURNED THEM GOLDEN, IT TOOK AWAY THE REALLY LIGHT BLONDE, IM HOPING IT WASHES OUT, I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT, BUT OVERALL MADE MY HAIR SOFT STRAIGHT AND MANAGEABLE."
2,ummmm no,"Ok maybe I didn't put enough, but at first after blow drying then flat ironing my hair was straight but not silky flat straight.it was thick and I could feel the product. I thought maybe the product had to set in but NOOOOO! My hair was dull, dry, and HUGE by the second day!I slept with it down and woke up to my hair curling up and even bigger!! Just awful I couldn't wait to wash it out and get my hair back to normal! I do have a lot of thick wavy curly hair, its a bit dry so it needs oils and serum. This stuff did nothing that I can tell...seemed softer when I washed out but that's it! Was really a waste of my time! I'm happy back to normal straight hydrated hair just by useing my john frieda serum for course hair! (Purple bottle) This stuff is great!! Btw.. The smell wasn't bad, smells like coconuts!"
1,Will change hair for the worse,"It's taken me a month after applying this treatment to my hair to write a review, i was trying to wait to see if my hair would change. I have (had) thick LONG hair and after following the instructions to a tee, i have uneven dry brittle hair that breaks with the slightest touch. If i would've known this i would have never put this in my hair, i just want my old hair back. I'll take thick and coarse over dry dry hard hair that sheds in chumps. No matter how many deep conditioners i have, my hair reverts to this weird texture that doesn't respond to moistureI'll never use this again and wouldn't advise it."
1,AWFUL,"The application was difficult, the instructions were vague (It didn't even say how much to use!), it smelled AWFUL, and it irritated my scalp. I waited just over the 48 hours it said to, and my hair isn't straight AT ALL, except for that it no longer has body. It looks like border collie fur. I wouldn't recommend this product to my worst enemy."
3,Seems smoother but not at all straighter,"I am Caucasian, I have light brown hair with natural blonde highlights, and it is curly but not spiral curly, just loose curls.This product took up a lot of my time. I just washed it out after 2 days (using the organix line of products) and the first thing I want to say is that I see my curls coming back. My hair has to fully dry before I tell you if my hair is any straighter at all but so far it's not looking good. Everyone who said it smelled when straightening, yes it did but it was tolerable with an open windows and lots of fans going. Plus, I held my breath a lot. The smell when washing it out however is disgusting. It smells like garbage. My hair stinks now!! The product did not do any damage to the color of my hair - its the same as before. Perhaps it will only change the hair color of people with dyed/chemically highlighted hair.UPDATE:Hair was smoother for about 2 weeks. Not worth the chemicals...."
1,organix everstraight keratine,I bought it for my daughter who has very curly hair. I followed the directions. The end results was very disappointing since her hair did not come out looking straight. Trinidad
1,worst product ever.,This is the worst thing i have ever put on my hair.If possible i wouldn't have given even a single star.Not only my hair became more fizzy i started shedding my hair..literally like a snake shedding its skin.Its been a month since i have used it my hair has reduced to half and have become more fizzy.I can see my scalp now.Every inch of the carpet has hair and i am vacuuming more times than before.I duuno if it suits other hair better.I would never recommend it to anyone.
1,"If you like heavy, greasy hair.","I bought this with little hope as it's not a salon treatment. Followed the directions, and after 45 minutes of blow drying my hair (Thick, shoulder length) I was probably another 25 minutes from it getting dry completely, white bits (from the product) in my hair and running my hands through my hair felt like I forgot to rinse out a very thick conditioner, I knew that there was no way I'd able to handle wearing it straight for work OR going 2 days without washing it.. I brushed it and the result a very sleek, very shiny ponytail to wear to work, but I will wash my hair right after I get home. Will not try again.. No disappointment really as I didn't expect much."
4,A little bottle of Keratin Gold,"I did not read any of the reviews about this product before I bought it because I am already an avid user of the brand. But I wish I had read some of the reviews on it before I used it because I was not happy about having to leave the product in for 48 hours. It did make my hair feel greasy and dirty. With that said, I will absolutely be using this product again and again. I did not even wait the full 48 hours because I just couldn't stand the feeling and immediately I felt a difference in my hair nourishment and softness. My hair is now much easier to manage and feels great. I am a serial hair colorer and my hair is far beyond damaged. But, after using this product it feels as if year and years of hair damage has been removed and my dry, damaged hair is now silky and touchable locks of shiny beauty. I would recommend this product to everyone."
1,Turns hair orange,"This product turns blonde hair bright brassy orange. Use with caution. It will straighten your hair, but hair has to be toned afterward, unfortunately the toner is costly and removes the benefits of the product."
3,Okayy,"Worked wonders in smoothing out the hair and getting rid of my natural waves when used first time. Strangely, didnt work the same way afterwards.."
1,PLEASEEEE NOT USE THIS!!!!!!!!,FIRST I BUY THIS PRODUCT THINKING BECAUSE IS ORGANIC AND ONLY LAST FEW MONTHS IS GONNA BE FINE BIG MISTAKE THE PRODUCT DID THE JOB BY MAKING MY HAIR STRAIGHT BUT AFTER FIRST 4 WEEKS MY HAIR BECOME REALLY WEAK AND NOW IS BRAKING AND FALLING IM SOOOO DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID BUYING THIS IF U CAN'T AFFORD A GOOD KERATIN TREAMENT WITH APROFESIONAL AT U BEAUTY SALON DON'T DO IT!!!! :(
1,Horrible smell - poor results,"I've never written a review before but I just had to take the time to warn people about this product. The smell was horrible, I couldn't go out in public for 48 hours because my hair looked like I had put a can of Crisco on it, and my hair didnt look much different after the first wash out. My hair is pretty straight to begin with - just a few waves and dents that I didn't want to flat iron - and it didn't even work on MY hair. This product is definitely not worth the money or the inconvenience."
2,Didn't work for me,"Followed instructions... waited more than 48 hours. Hair is still just as curly as before, though it does feel very soft. I think that everyone's hair is different and it just didn't work for me. Cheap enough that it's worth a try, though!"
1,"no difference, just dry","I did not notice a difference with this product. I followed directions, and my hair looks the same as it did before, just damaged."
3,dissapointed :(,"I paid around $195 to get this real treatment at a salon a couple years back. LOVED IT so much but geez that's expensive. So I see this in Walmart and decided to try it. Sure it gave me maybe half the results the salon gave me, but turned my blonde hair very brassy ""/ definitely gonna pay to have it done next time. And also, to all of you who are afraid of the formaldehyde in it, are you aware of how much beauty stuff we use that contain formaldehyde??? Nailpolish, liquid foundation, you name it. Get over It."
1,Extremely negative side effects - user beware,"I'll start by saying I have short, coarse, combination curly/wavy hair. I saw this product and that it's considered safe for color treated hair so I decided to give it a shot. The instructions and application were easy enough. The scent of the product was unpleasant. The appearance of my hair during the 48 hour wait wasn't what I consider leave the house worthy. The real trouble began during the wash out process after the 48 hour wait. Almost immediately, as I was shampooing my hair (in a well ventilated shower) I started to feel light-headed, dizzy, and nauseous. I finished up and my vision was literally spinning. This continued for 6+ hours post-wash. As for the condition of my hair, the cuticle is slightly smoother but the curl and wave remain. The hair at the nape of my neck was totally unchanged. It seems as though others had a good experience with the product but I did not, and I won't take the chance of using it again."
1,NASTY mess made me itch,"This treatment is a hot mess! I couldn't stand it and washed it out after only a few hours, so of course it didn't work for me - I am still itching and my scalp is burning. I must be allergic to something in it. Called the number for Organix, and they said ""see a dermatologist."" When I discussed it with the dermatologist, she says contact the company. Both answers are not great, meanwhile I have itchy red bumps on my shoulders and neck and my scalp itches like crazy."
2,Didn't do much,"I really wanted this product to work, but in the end it didn't change my hair that much. I'm biracial with very curly poofy frizzy hair, i guess the treatment caused my hair to calm down a bit, but not huge change. My hair is a little less frizzy, but still curly and poofy. Took me about 1.5 hours to do treatment. I think I may have put in too little of serum because i was afraid of oversaturating my hair. Very little overall change, but at least my hair didn't fall out!"
2,yikes,"Currently, my eyes are itching and watery. I just applied it this morning. It straightened my hair quite fine, but there are little white particles that look like dandruff from it. It does stink somewhat, but there is also a coconut smell. As a matter of fact, someone at the store today said, ""It smells like coconut."" while walking past me. However, the itchy, watery eyes I could live without. Also, my throat is kind of achy. I can't wait to wash this buisness out of my hair. Maybe all these afflictions will go away when I do wash it out."
5,The best shine serum out there,"I just bought this shine serum and it is just the best. I used a small amount on my hair at the office and the next person that came in said ""Wow, your hair is so shiny! What are you using""? That NEVER happens to me. Next thing you know, everyone was stopping by to try some and all of them were amazed at the results. I have natural kinky curly hair and need all the shine I can get. It has a pleasant vanilla scent, not too strong and doesn't make my hair greasy. After I rub it into my hair, I massage the rest onto my cuticles and hands and it keeps them nice and soft too. Excellent product and a little goes a long way so it should last a while."
1,My hair is exactly the same as before!,"I'm so very disappointed in this product. I followed the instructions to a T, and was initially very impressed. Immediately after doing the treatment, my hair was as straight and smooth as hair can be. I waited 48 hours before washing, as instructed. I washed with sulfate-free shampoo, as instructed. But as soon as I took the towel off of my head, every little spiral sprang right back up, as if I had never done a thing. I let my hair air-dry to see what would happen, and I ended up with a giant, frizzy, curly mess. I was stunned. I can't believe I spent hours treating my hair with this product, only to end up exactly where I started."
5,Worked well for me,"I found this at the local pharmacy on clearance for $5, so thought I'd give it a try. I notice other reviewers said it wasn't good for blondes, but i have blonde highlights, and they were lightened only a little. I have naturally wavy, full hair that can't decide whether to be straight or curly. This really didn't take all the curl out, but I definitely have less frizz now, so i'm happy..also, I may not have used enough treatment, because i was afraid to oversaturate. Worth the price, I think, my hair is still silky after 2 weeks.**** Update, 10 months after first application *****I have used this product again a few times since first application, and I am still very happy with it. I haven't used it in probably 4 months, and am starting to notice some frizz coming back, so will probably do another application this weekend."
3,This is Okay!,"This product feels silky and it works well with flat ironing the hair and for keeping the hair feeling silky after blow drying. But I don't think you should use this product every time, I think you should alternate this product with heat protectant products because I thinks it dries out your hair with frequent use and will wear your hair down with frequent use."
4,DId what I expected,"All in all, this product did what I wanted it to do: smoothed out my hair and cut back on styling time. I have very very thick long hair, it is not super curly but I have a nice natural wave. This product did NOT eliminate my wave, it only took out a little of my natural curl. I also have colored hair and it didn't affect my color (dark brown with red highlights and low lights). It cut back on styling time immensely for me which is why I really like it. When I now blow-dry/ flat iron my hair it's sleeker, shiner, and less wavy. After flat-ironing my hair it now straightens much easier and feels amazingly soft, less heavy, and keeps it's style. The only bad thing about this product is the time it takes to process. The entire process took me 4 hours and I could not stand keeping the product in my hair for 48 hours so I washed it out after 24 hours. This may have affected my results a bit, but I am still pleased with my results for the price."
3,Minimal damage but only lasted until first wash,"I used this Thursday and waited until today, Monday, to wash it. I just didn't trust it would last through a washing. I was right. It took 3 or 4 hours to straighten my bra strap length hair which would have been well worth it if it had lasted the 30 days, or something near that.It was a beautiful straight, though. Although, I was tired of the smell. It's a bit overwhelming. I think it's the avocado and whatever other oils I could smell.It was fun while it lasted but it didn't last long enough."
1,Horrible,I have had the Keratin treatment several times and I tried this one and it's horrible! My hair was so greasy and it smelled terrible. I would not recommend this product.
5,Perfect leave in treatment!,"I have naturally frizzy - I mean curly hair. An amount of this Coconut Oil treatment the size of a quarter smooths and seals my hair without the greasy look that frizz-ease or other silicone treatments leave. It's worth every penny to have frizz free curls this summer. I've used it as a ""hot oil"" type treatment, it's ok for that, but as a leave in it yields great results!"
1,NOT FOR BLONDES!!!,"Yes, my hair is silky from this, but it is also ORANGE!!! I have very light blonde hair, and unfortunately I bought it at a drug store so I did not see any reviews online before using it. I looked over the box and packets inside and it does not say anything about discoloration, nor does their website, in fact it says ""recommended for all hair types including highlighted, colortreated, etc etc"" Which, highlights are usually blonde right?? Well after a couple hours of this being in my hair was ORANGE!!!! I washed it out early because I was freaking out and it is still orange. They need to put out a warning: NOT FOR BLONDES!!"
1,not impressed,"I have shoulder length wavy/medium/frizzy hair. I used the product exactly as the directions said. No bad smells at all, not while applying, not while washing, I have no idea what the people who had odors were talking about.My hair was stick straight and practically plastered to my head for the 48 hours, but wearable for work. I was afraid it might come out too straight and thin looking! Boy was I ever wrong. Washed my hair today expecting SOME sort of change...NOTHING! NADA. MY hair is EXACTLY the way it always was my entire life. Glad I only paid 9.00 and wasted two days."
1,"works OK, smell is terrible!!!!!","I have spent a small fortune on trying to straighten and calm my long thick curly hair (chi, yuko). After reviewing the ingredients (no formaldyhyde), I gave it a try. When blowing my hair dry with the solution on it, there is a terrible smell and almost ""smoke"", so be sure you are in a well ventilated room. The smell is not like a harsh chemical more like burnt oatmeal (that my best description). My hair continued to smell that way even after several shampoo's with the recommended shampoo and conditioner. My hair was easier to manage, and soft, but not worth it. Whatever that smell is it can't be good for you, I think I stick with olive oil and other natural ingredients."
1,Wasted Time and Burned my Ears!,"I followed the directions but still had trouble preventing skin contact of product on my ears when sleeping. Ears started to burn and turn red after I woke up in the am and persisted despite careful washing of ears alone. When time to wash out the product I let my hair air dry and found only MINIMAL decrease in frizz and only MINIMAL decrease in curls (I have thick, curly/wavy, frizzy, dry hair). Ended up with a chemical burn to my ears that still hurts despite copious amounts of aloe vera applications. Also had to straighten my hair still to get rid of the frizz but it took 2x longer to get rid of the frizz and straighten my hair. Wont do it again, hope this helps others. Def. dont recommend this product. Wasted 2 days, got almost no results, ended up with chemical burn to ears (hope I don't get cancer) :("
5,Smells great!,"I love this stuff. I usually get it from Target. It has such a nice smell that reminds me of summer. I have wavy hair and I put this in when my hair is still wet, scrunch my hair, and let it air dry. It looks shiny and smells great. No frizz. Also, this product isn't sticky. I hate heavy, sticky products especially in the summer."
1,Doesn' work at all,"Long story short, followed directions a ""T."" Didn't do anything! Contacted customer services via email, they sent me a copy of the directions. HUGE WASTE!"
3,Not for blondes ~ turns brassy ~ will need toner~ otherwise good,I used this product as directed. It did the job yes...but my highlighted hair now looks brassy. : (Video of application:[...]I will have to go to the salon and have then putin a toner... $40.00. Would getpretty expensive every month to have to do.I might try this at home:[...]I think I will not use again...? I will justuse my usual products to keep down the frizz.This is good.amazon paul mitchel super skinny serum[...]
2,didnt work for me,"I have virgin, fine, straight, blonde hair that over the past few years has started growing dark curly hairs that frizz out. The product was very easy to use. It has a strong smell, but not a bed smell. I also must say that there was no way I was going to set my flat iron at 450. That's ridiculous! But also may be why it didn't work for me. I also only used a little less than half of the shampoo and keratin treatment. My hair looked amazing the first day though! Just washed it and air dried it, and poof! Frizz! It is shinier and feels a bit softer, but it did nothing for my frizz. If I do decide to do it again, I will use more product and set my iron a bit higher, but I don't think it would make a difference."
1,You get what you pay for,"I have very healthy, long, wavy hair. I just wanted to spruce it up a bit and not have to blow dry it as often, so I decided to try this.After finishing, my hair was pin straight, silky and smooth. It was like a dream, and I got so many compliments. Only after a week did my HAIR START FALLING OUT. I found long strands from the roots on my pillow, in my shower drain. This has NEVER happened to me before.I definitely will not use it again"
2,Works for one time use,"Just a quick review...I have had a Brazilian Keratin treatment done on my hair about two years ago with great success. I have light brown hair with blond highlights and my hair is pretty stick straight. Treatment lasted about four months. With regards to the Organix product, it does take a while to apply, and if the directions are followed, does turn out similar to a Brazilian Keratin treatment. The downside is I washed my hair two days later with sulfite free shampoo, and my hair was a frizzy mess. I didn't use the remainder of the treatment as its just too time consuming for something that only lasts a day or two. My advice, save the money and get a real Brazilian Keratin treatment from a qualified stylist. Ask to speak to some of their clients and make sure they do good work. Good luck."
1,"I should have saved my time spent, resulted in no change","I have gotten the salon Brazilian treatments and decided to try this at home process. Unfortunately, the product did not work for me. My hair is wavy, not curly, but has some frizz. I didn't take any shortcuts and spent a lot of time using the rinse, putting the solution in, drying, and then flat ironing small pieces of my hair. Leaving the product in for 2 days was a waste of time. There was no to very little difference in my hair compared to the salon treatment I have received with amazing results."
2,cant stand the smell!,I have curly long hair so i was excited to try this product. I love the shampoos and conditioners. It made my hair extremely greasy and left a weird odor. I cant put my finger on the odor but its annoying and gross smelling. I followed directions and i don't see a difference. Highly disappointed!
3,USE A DAB!,"Very heavy product, leaves hair oily if you use more than a dab or the size of a pea. I have used better product for breakage that doesn't leave the heavy look or feel."
3,Keratin treatment,I tried this and do not know if it worked. I have very frizzy hair and it did nothing for me. Maybe it was the wrong product for me to try.
3,OOh Laa Laa Shine!,This serum gives my hair shine like none other. I use it on dry hair before I undo twist or braids. It smells delightful and the price isn't bad at all. 2-3 pumps usually will coat all of my hair. *Remember* A little goes a long way!
1,Does Not Work,"This product simply does not work.I followed the instructions meticulously, which took at least 3 hours from start to finish. I used the highest setting on my hair straightener. I went over every strand at least 7 times. I did not wash my hair for more than the 48 recommended hours in order to let the product work its magic. I even did touch-up straightening during the 48 hour window in order to make sure my hair remained stick-straight.When I washed my hair - TADA! - it was back to exactly the same texture it was before: persistently wavy, not really curly, not really straight. The product did not smooth or de-frizz my hair in any way. Total waste of time and money.I used about half the bottle on my thick, collar-bone length hair, and I did not find it to be too heavy or greasy feeling. My hair looked amazing during the 2 day waiting period. What a disappointment that the effect 100% washed away the first time I washed my hair."
2,Disappointing :(,"I have been very happy with the Organix products that I have tried, but found this one disappointing. The process is long and it did not last for 30 days on my hair.My hair looked great the day I did the treatment. The next day it was stiff and hard to style. You have to keep applying it after every wash for a smooth finish. I find that I can get the finish I am looking for with the Organix Brazian Anti Breakage product without the tedious application of the 30 day treatment."
1,DO NOT USE if you are a BLONDE!!!,I used the product today on my long light blonde hair (which has taken me forever to grow) and it turned a yellowish/orange color. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone. It smells absolutely horrible and feels super greasy. There is no warning in the directions regarding blondes.
5,Excellent,This product is great. it smells great and leaves a subtle shine that lasts for days. My hair is about 3-4 inches below my shoulder and one pump is enough to cover my entire head. I used another half of a pump to apply down my side part. My hair is usually dry so i like that the serum isn't heavy and it doesn't weigh my hair down or get too greasy. Just great stuff.
1,BLONDES BEWARE!!!,"I have light brown hair with (professionally-colored) platinum blonde highlights. I followed the directions and used a 450 flat iron. After the third pass with the flat iron, on my very first section of hair, I thought that I noticed a slight darkening in my highlights. Cautiously, I pulled it through a fourth time and, too my horror, the blonde sections transitioned into a deep, dull shade of reddish-orange.Even the process of blowing it out under a hot dryer has fully destroyed my color. In the sunlight, I can now see that all of my highlights have become very yellow and brassy. If my hairdresser is unable to fix it, I am afraid that I will have to cut a good portion of it.Bottom line--there is no shortcut. Pay the money to have it done professionally or be prepared to spend the equivalent in repairs/restoration."
1,IF YOU WANT ORANGE HAIR THIS IS FOR YOU!!,DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IT WILL TURN YOUR HAIR ORANGE AND HAIR IS DESTROYED NEVER FEELS RIGHT AGAIN> IT TURNS YOUR HAIR TO MUSH; LEAVE IT TO A PROFESSIONAL THIS PRODUCT DISGUSTING>
4,Costs more but for good reason,"This particular hook is more costly than others but that is for good reason, it looks so much better than those that are lower priced. Depending on where you need it, this is the one you'll want."
1,Misleading finish,"The finish is not oil rubbed bronze, but rather black metal -- be cautious if you're trying to pair with other oil rubbed bronze finishes, as you'll have a noticable disparity. Product should be retitled in terms of finish."
1,bronze robe hook,The color bronze was more black than bronze. I returned the hook because I was not happy with the color.
1,Not Bronze,"I orderred this item and the suggested t/p roll holder because they were suggested as matches for a really beautiful towel bar that I got for a great deal. These items are not oil rubbed bronze, the are very dark solid brown. No color variation like it should have. Doesn't match at all."
5,Great book!!!,"Ok, so I'm on vacation in New York a few weeks back and I actually scored some tickets to see The Producers. We were REALLY high up but I did not care. Truly, this show is ""the best new musical of the decade."" After the show I began a quest for a nearby Starbucks--which, by the way, close at 1100p in Manhattan, something that still baffles me--so I stop in the Barnes and Noble near Lincoln Center to get a book for the plane ride home. I find this wonderful little book and begin reading when I get back to my hotel. I stayed up til 200a reading this book then fell asleep from just being tired, then I finished it the next morning. So much for reading it on the plane... this is SUCH a great book! BUY IT! :)"
5,"OPEN, HONEST, HEARTWARMING","This book was like looking into the life of Richard Simmons, and how he bacame the man he is today. His openess, honesty and sincerity are evident through-out the book. I laughed, I cried, and most importantly, I identified with his weight loss ups and downs. Here is someone who has 'been there', not a size 2 supermodel who has never had to carry an extra pound in their life! I had the privelege of meeting Richard yesterday in Boston, and there truly is no artifice there. What you see is what you get, and all I can say is: God Bless Richard Simmons! Read the book!"
4,I am still hungry,"I did not know much about Richard Simmons before reading this book. I enjoyed reading about his childhood, college years and early years in the career world. I do feel like he could have shared more photos as well as sharing if he is or isn't gay....I think most people just want to know if he has had a special someone in his life. I still would like to know more about him."
2,The literary equivalant of reading a cereal box !,"I have a great deal of respect for Richard Simmons, however, this book did absolutely NOTHING for me ! Richard lets us know a little more about his family, which is nice.....but not very much about himself. The stories related are old and nothing that we haven't heard before. Now, don't get me wrong, I think this book does have some merits......it is very easy to read and quite humorous. If you just LOVE Richard and hang on his every word, you will love this book. If you are purchasing it for gossip value, FORGET IT !"
5,Great reading!,"I think this is a terrific book! Easy reading, great senseof humor in the book, and an overall concept of Richard'slife. One of those books that you hate to put down becauseyou want to know what is going to happen next! I highlyrecommend this book to anyone that has a few obstacles inlife while growing up and someone that enjoys reading aboutpeople that have achieved their goals! Richard has comealong way from what was little Milton many years ago!"
1,"My copy tasted like type-written paper, but I ate it anyway","When will it all end?Please, start eating or shut up.You've grown tiresome."
3,Ok for month but wore off,"I was really into the reviews that i read on here. For about a month, they worked great. But i felt like they started to wear off after the month. They also developed a horrid smell about them...fishy and really put me off. I then decided to get the bladderwrack tincture. You just dissolve drops in water and take it three times a day, it worked great and still working and i lost 7lbs within a month."
3,Iodine content per pill too low,"My main complaint against this product is i) that the iodine content per pill is very low at 200 mcg, and ii) that the content is not clearly communicated on the product page. I thought the content per pill would be at least 500 mcg. To get 800 mcg which is my current dose, I need to take 4 pills. I want to swallow as little as possible in terms of fillers, so taking 4 pills per day is just too much."
3,Not sure,"Taking as directed not seeing/feeling anything different, These smell bad so need to take quick!"
1,what an ugly dress,I bought this dress for my daughter first of all it came damaged the material looks like the plastic of a shower curtain. very ugly really mad..
2,Buy a Different Costume,"The picture looks better than the actual costume. My daughter will not even where this one because it is ""To Itchy""."
4,Tim Harmon Photography of China,Beautiful photographs you will have to see them all. Excellent coffee table picture book with information about the people and places throughout China.
3,"Well, it has nice pictures...",144 pages. Introduction by Madame Chaing Kai-Shek. Wonderful photographs...it is somewhat of a coffee table book.
3,The continuing story after the last emperor,"After reading the book ""The Last Manchuu"" the autobiography of the last emperor of China PuYi, I often wondered about what happened to the remaining cast of the story. This book was able to satisfy some of my curiosity. In contrast to the rather heavy approach taken in 'The Last Manchu' and the epic movie by Bernardo Bertolucci, Tony Scotland has given us a cheerful narrative of his romp through China in search of the 'next' emperor along with his rather interesting sidekick 'loud report'. This is not meant to be a serious book on history although there was enough of it for the reader to sustain his curiosity as it reaches a satisfactory conclusion. I am somewhat surprised that it took a Westerner to write this long overdue followup on the story of the last emperor. For all who had seen the movie, I highly recommend this book."
4,Tito Puente Tambo,"I grew up listening to latin music back in the day. Tambo is one of my favorite albums, because the tunes on the disc differed in sound. I don't think these songs remind me of the jungle because, I only lived in the urban jungle. I don't even see natives dancing in my mind. I just like the way the songs sound."
2,I do not like this CD!,"I find this CD boring. Every song sounds the same to me. There is one exception, Por Amarte, this is a very nice song."
1,not what I expected,"Although Pepe is an excellent singer, this is not the type of music we enjoy. We prefer Marc Antonio Solis. Much better!"
3,Best Cheese EVER!,"... but I have to note that the price is EXTREMELY high here. My local Whole Foods carries it for $14.99 a round, the local high-priced gourmet store for $17.99.It's worth twice the price, but still... you might want to shop around!"
2,Bleh....,"I can't believe I spent hours of my life reading this self-indulgent drivel. The guy should have kept this all in a journal and saved the rest of us from having to read it. It sounded like such an interesting premise, but it soon disintegrated into whiny mush. This guy has such an unremarkable life. I got sick of hearing about his lack of intimate relationships and his draft-dodging, pot-smoking, incest-driven existence. Many, many people have had lousy, abusive childhoods. Many people dodged the draft; everyone I know has smoked pot and drank and felt directionless. BIG DEAL! I sympathize with him because of the abuse, but I can't fathom how everyone's to blame for his problems except himself. For god's sake, his parents put a roof over his head, he had plenty of food, he even had toys. OK, so it wasn't the most loving household, but after he moved out, he could have done something with his life. Other than publish this boring, self important volume."
4,it's the real story,"Without pity or too much drama, Stephen Zanichowsky write the story for every one of us who grew up in a large family. The book works as a form of his own therapy, but inspires me to face what happened to me, even just for my own benefit of trying to understand or make sense of what happens in a family in which the parents are overwhelmed by too many children, too little resources, and too many human failings. Reading Zanichowsky's story reminded me of my own experiences, many memories that have been buried. I wonder about Zanichowsky's siblings--how they felt about this book. It would take amazing courage to write this book, and a great deal of forgiveness from all of the siblings to publish the real story of their growing up."
3,Great cold weather album,"This album also works well as a winter album. Lots of times I'll want to listen to ""Illinoise"" but I'm like, that sounds too warm and summery. This album actually sounds like music you want to cuddle up to under a blanket when the weather is nice and cold outside. It works much in the same way the Arcade Fire's ""Funeral"" does. Especially the last cd. So if you are turned off by the idea of a Sufjan Steven's Christmas album much in the same vein as an Alan Jackson Christmas album or the Brian Setzer Orchestra, then you shouldn't let that stop you from buying this album. There are definitley holiday songs on here and it is a holiday album overall, but there is also a wealth of seasonal music on here that makes you feel good in the winter. So if you love Sufjan Steven's, and you want a good winter album of his to listen to, this is it."
5,A Christmas delight,"After first reading the reviews of this on e music, I tried a few songs. My wife and I loved them, and I decided to just buy the set. What a delight, took the set to my in laws to listen to during Christmas celebration. The comments were non-stop throughout the day of how everyone loved the music. it is fresh, clean, not overpolished. Homey can be used.Whatever, it was PERFECT for a day with family, adding to the family FEEL of the day. A must buy!!!!!"
5,wonderful,"A great compilation of holiday standards as well as some very interesting Sufjan originals, and not annoying like some other holiday disks. I especially enjoyed the interesting array of instruments used. It will make that eggnog taste even better."
4,This is how a serious minded musician home schools his family.,Good for him. You have to accept him for what he is and trying to do. This is a bargain and some of it is really great.
5,might have bought this entire album for one song...,Sister Winter might be one of the most moving songs i've heard in a long time. The more I listen to it the more I feel like crying; his voice is just hauntingly beautiful in the chorus.
2,A friend recommnded...,I haven't listened to both CDs but was not wild about the songs I did listen to. Way too expensive for something not special. I feel a re-gifting next year...
5,Alternative Christmas,"This is the perfect alternative to tired, holiday songs! So fun to listen to, you'll be humming the tunes long after the tree is down."
5,Very much enjoy this cd set,We are listening to this right now and enjoy it very much. I am not very familiar with Sufjan Stevens' other music but will be looking it up.
4,Great Collection,"I have always abhorred Christmas music, with so few saving graces such as Trans Siberian Orchestra and now I can add this to the collection. I love how he decided to use some very obscure Christmas carols i.e. Bring a Torch Jeanette, Isabella and I Saw Three Ships. It still baffles me how songs like those are so obscure while many of the luminaries in the genre are so sub par."
2,Preachy,"I have really loved Sufjan's projects in previous years, however I don't even think I will be able to keep ""Songs for Christmas"" in my music library. I have already deleted many songs. I felt this album was a bit heavy and preachy, not the fun album I was hoping to play at work around the holidays to beat the usual doldrums of holday music. I can appreciate right to religious expression, especially with a Christmas album, but it was just not for me. That being said, the banjo work was beautiful. If this was a banjo-centric album I would have really enjoyed it."
4,"Amateur, but fun","Basic photocopy spiral bound book. Good design concepts, excellent ideas. Would like to have seen some photos of finished concepts."
5,Don't be fooled by looks -- that's kind of the whole point.,"The book does appear to be self-published at Kinko's, so it is easy to dismiss it without looking inside.However, if you're looking for practical advice on how secret rooms and compartments work, this is it. After looking through all the books on the library shelf which describe general ideas, you'll eventually find yourself ready to actually build a secret place. That's where this book comes in. The real ""tricks of the trade"" are in here if you're handy enough to do it yourself ... and, I expect, if you're in the business of carpentry or cabinetry and want to expand the services you provide."
4,Some good ideas,This had several very good ideas for hidden rooms or compartments. I am a wood worker and none of this requires a lot of skill.
1,Save your money for something else.,"I wish I could tell you wonderful things about this, but I can't. Don't make my mistake. You probably don't want this.There are lovely scenic panoramas, but absolutely no indications of what they are or where they might be. Not even a subtitle. There is lovely music. That's all. Sweeping unidentified photography and music in the background.If you just like to look at snow and rock, this might be the video for you, If you're trying to plan a trip to Switzerland, it will just make you angry and frustrated."
5,Intriguing,"My third graders can't wait to get to the Center and read this book over and over. They act as though they've never read it before, and beg to read it again."
5,A classic that had me laughing as a child...,"It's about a teacher named ""Miss Nelson"" that has a lack of control of her class and chooses other tactics to sway the children into obedience and homework. Miss Nelson decides to disguise herself in an elaborate witchs' costume (complete with the wig,nose and don't forget the chin implant). Miss Nelson is now THE infamous substitute teacher, ""Viola Swamp"". She snaps the kids into shape quick and just when everyone, including the town inspector, is about to give up all hopes of recovering the beloved Miss Nelson she shows up as if nothing had happened with a well kept secret her and Viola only share. The town inspector is now searching for ""Viola Swamp"". This book was a favorite of mine, first read to me by my first grade teacher and has stuck with me enough to recently purchase a copy to read to my five year old son. He loves it! His favorite character in the book is Viola Swamp. It's perfect for children and teachers alike!"
5,Pleases the kids,"It's a great story and the CD is great too (with different ""voices"").It's great for the classroom or the independent, new reader."
2,Not worth the money,"When I recived this book, the CD was broken, and the packaging was poor. It was a paper back which it didnt describe so i was a little disapointed. I found the hard back cover a local store in town for 6$."
1,Miss Nelson is Missing,"I just want to say that this book is definitely not for 4 year old children. My son who is 4 would not go into his school one day because of Ms. Swamp. His teacher uses this Miss Swamp to threaten the class and if they are not good, Ms. Swamp will come to the class. So I don't like it at all and probably more appropriate for much older kids that can understand it."
5,An all time favorite,"This book was one of my childhood favorites, so I bought it for my son to read. He's read it a few times already and has asked for the series of related books. We like how sweet Miss Nelson outsmarts her unruly students in the most clever of ways to gain their attention and respect. Every good story needs a hero and a villain, it just so happens that Miss Nelson figured out the perfect way to do both."
5,miss nelson is missing,"Miss Nelson is missingThe main character is the witch. There is a witch that is mean in the classroom,and doesn't like any kids.Here is a connection with my life and the story.In second grade I had a rowdy class .My favorite thing is the witch in the class. The unanswered question is who was the witch?I liked it because it had a mystery."
5,You don't know what you've got till it's gone!,"I am preparing to begin my 25th year as an elementary school teacher. Whenever my children get ornary, I announce that VIOLA SWAMP will be coming in the next day. An absolute MUST HAVE for every elementary classroom library."
5,Miss Nelson is Wonderful!,I love this book. I like how the detective and Miss Nelson almost have the same shaped face.
5,I am going to be Miss Viola Swamp,"I told my second graders that if they don't start behaving that Miss Viola Swamp will be their teacher. They don't know who she is, so I am buying them the book to read ASAP. Hopefully, this will work! Thanks!"
4,The forgotten in the basement,"And this movie slipped under the wires. It is a good movie...and proving to me that anything Joshua Leonard is in will be worth a look. It has creepy moments...and twists along the way...but it is all easy to follow. I would have enjoyed seeing more of the head nurse act...she was off the wall! Smiling a Joshua one moment...glaring and moving her eyes to your eye level the next in a stern stare down like a snake.Red herring driven, the plot will keep you entertained. And guessing as to who or what is killing the staff......"
3,Meh,"Remembered thinking this movie was great when i was a kid, rewatched it and realized it wasn't all that great. For a B-grade movie its alright."
4,Better than many recent major releases,"Although a low cost ""direct to video"" release, and a predictable ending, MADHOUSE was a well done film and much better than some of the big budget releases from the major studios these past 3 years !I am adding it to my DVD collection."
1,what a bad movie,simplemente...una perdida de tiempo..pesima historia...final predecible....no se si es tan mala que Saw....otro aborto del cine holliwodensesaludos
1,RIDICULOUS,worst movie ever! bad acting! lame plot.....movies like this are a waste of your time. go rent Toolbox Murders or May.
2,Bland with a so-so ending,"Kinda what you'd expect from an insane asylum movie. Same ol, same ol! It's has a pretty good story. The first half of the movie is enjoyable, but then it pretty much fell apart towards the end. I'm glad I watched it but won't watch it again!"
3,Be a lot better with a better ending.,"Dr. Brad Pitt wanna-be arrives as an intern at the Cunningham mad house (some reference to Sean Cunningham I guess) on arrival things seem like your garden variety of nut house inmates, until he starts seeing things and investigates while murders start happening, he is unsure if it's a person or supernatural.I wont say what the ending is, but the movie sucked me in to where I was enjoying it, but then the ending did not pay off for me, if it had a better ending then I'm sure this movie would have done a bit better then it did, it just really seemed rushed and not done right.I suppose there is nothing anyone can do about it now, so to take it for what it is, it's ok, much better then some of the other poor horrors I rented when I found this one, but I can't see anyone wanting to keep this movie and watch it again anytime soon, nor highly recommend it to anyone. It's not a disappointment, and a decent pop corn flick, just don't expect too much of it."
3,Not Nearly Enough Screen-Time For Dendrie Taylor!...,"Ok, MADHOUSE is a confounding movie to me. It has great atmosphere throughout, yet spoils some of it by being so hokey in spots! The ghostly kid is lame, especially when he goes floating past the windows! Still, I did like the basic storyline, and some of the characters were quite original. Joshua Leonard was a decent Clark, though his wimpiness did grate my nerves! Thankfully, he redeems himself at the end. Jordan Ladd is not only a hottie, but also a good actress. She adds a nice twist in the plot. Lance Henriksen is always a treat to watch! His Dr. Frank is both nefarious and mysterious. My biggest complaint about MADHOUSE is the lack of screen-time for Dendrie Taylor! Her Nurse Hendricks character was wicked and f-u-n! I was shocked to see her bumped off so quickly! What a waste! Oh well, that's my take on it anyway..."
3,3.5 stars,"First off this movie is not worth 22$, I would say $15 would be alot more reasonable. The acting is very good, the plot is also good. This movie is good enough IMO to be in any horror collection very creepy and spooky at times. If you are unsure about the video then rent it first if you can find it. This might not be so helpful, but its a good horror movie, dont expect a classic but its not a dissapointing hour and 3o minutes, pretty cool."
3,No way this is the book of the year,"I won't say that Susan Choi's new book is bad, but in my opinion, it is neither a masterpieice nor the book of the year. In fact, it is rather arrogant and presumptous to call it so. It is very clear that the book is by no means without flaws -- it's preachy and self-righeous and didactic. When I read a novel, I need to care about its main chracter: feel what he/she feels and sympathize with his/her predicament. Unfortunately, I came away with a feeling that Jenny is not a real person, but a prototype."
1,Boring! Had to put it away after a few pages,"I forced myself to read the 6 pages or so. This took tremendous effort and time (about 10 minutes) and still I didn't quite ""get it"". What is this book about and how did it get published???I admit all books fall into two categories for me: I either love it and can't put it down until it is done or I have to force myself to read the first few pages then wind up giving it away or putting it in the back of the book shelf. Unfortunately, this book falls in the latter category."
2,Not quite memorable,"This novel is solid and well-crafted, but dull and forgettable, unfortunately. After hearing about the premise, I was excited to read it. But it suffers from a few too many cliches, trite conclusions, a general lack of freshness. Having read and enjoyed her first novel, I guess I expected much more from her second."
3,American Woman by Susan Choi,Interesting story but disturbing. I think it was meant to be that way because it shows the inescapable power one person can have over another.
1,Total rip off,"If you saw Guys Gone Wild then don't waste your time and money on this one. Some of the same guys are in this one as in the first one with no new guys that I recall. There is a longer shower scene with the cute guy from the first one, but that is it. You don't even get to see the two ""big"" guys from the first one. I hope this has cured me from buying these ""movies""."
4,guys gone wild: frat boys,"good, these are the before hard series, still lots of good lookingyoung men"
2,Term-paper snoozefest,"These authors exhibit no real literary feel for any aspect of Vinson's life: his participation in New Deal era, his roots in eastern Kentucky, the Supreme Court, or the personality of the man himself. His years in Congress, for example, or covered with endless quotations from mundane Congressional speeches, and excerpts from unremarkable constituent correspondence. This is biography-as-term-paper, rather than as a transformative effort to place a vital human being in the context of place and time, as the best biographers try to do. (Wikipedia would do just as well, and at less length). Granted, Vinson is not among the more ""exciting"" figures of 20th century American history, but still he was a man who lived (and achieved power)at a dynamic time. You do not get to know this man in this book."
4,"An album in a sad, reflective style.","This is an album that strikes me as José José's reflections on a life past. The title song is one that decribes (not in acutal numbers) a relationship he had with a younger woman in real life. Also, my favorite, Eso Nomas, is one in which he describes after a relationship has gone bad, don't speak badly of me, remember what was good. Love ended, that & no more. If you're in a mood to reflect on your own lost loves, this is a 3 hanky album! :) ESPANOL: Para mí, este album es muy triste con unas refleciones de los tiempos que han pasado. En el canción de el título, 40 y 20, yo pienso por él (José) es casi autobiografical. El canción, Eso Nomas, esta diciendo que cuando ""el amor acaba"" que ""no hables mal de mi, no te vale hacer asi, que no soy un emimgo- Dios es testigo cuanto te ame."" Para mi es una de los mejores canciones de José José, como ""El Amor Acaba."" y perdoname si mi español no es tan buena... :)"
1,Misleading name,"I purchased this to try and approximate the silver leaf that came off of two small leaves in a wall sconce. I didn't expect it to BE like silver leaf, but I certainly didn't expect it to be grey and dull, which is what it was. I would not recommend this as any kind of substitue for leaf, and it looks NOTHING like the photo here. It's cheap, yes. And bad."
5,Good Product,"This stuff is addicting to use! It works well, goes on easily, and looks nice. Works best when warmer. I used it on retro brass knobs on my grandparent's old dresser. It makes the whole thing look new! I also used it on varnished wood in a couple spots, with no issues. A little bit goes a very long way. Well worth the price."
3,Ehhh,They're ok. Get the job done. I just bought them because they were the only company that had my size under 100.
4,Decent product for the price,"I bought this because it seemed to be less cheap than other shoe organizers and the price was right. I'm happy with it, just wish they had had more options color wise. Very easy to assemble."
1,defective,Cable was defective and too cheap to return. Purchased one (different manufacturer) locally that worked fine. My recommendation is to buy two for insurance because it was 1/6th the cost of the one I had to buy to replace it. Every company has some defects so I won't hold it against them.
1,Junky,The product arrived defective. the smaller end was poorly constructed and bent externally. Made of really malleable metal. Needs to be returned.
5,Works great; great price,"I was able to easily plug this into my Sony DCR-HC30 DV Camcorder and into my iMac and within seconds was transferring some old vacation videos into iMovie successfully. To address another review, the 4/9 pin connectors on the one I have do appear to be gold plated, though the outer metal housing on the 4 pin side does not appear to be. At this price, yes, this might have been made in China. But it works and I'm pleased with it."
1,Buyer Beware! Bogus Listing.,Description is a lie. These are not Tripp Lite cables and they do not have gold connectors. They are very cheap Chinese knock-offs. They are cheap and may work ok but the description is completely false.
5,does the job!,"Transfer my movies from my camcorder to my macbook pro without problems, well builded cables and amazon like ever fantastic, good prices, fast shipping and great services!!"
5,This cable is good,The cable is so good I mean its finishing and efficient connectivity. I wish it had a stabilizing frame at the 9 pin end. Although this does not affect connectivity but you feel like it might come off your computer
1,Did not work at all.,"I have a Canon GL1 video camera and a less-than-a-year-old iMac. When I connect them together, the computer doesn't even recognize it."
4,"Reliable cable, works as advertised.","I am using this cable to transfer DV content from an old Sony MiniDV PC-120BT camcorder (Firewire 400 port) to an iMac 27"" 2010 (Firewire 800 port) and it works flawlessly. It costs around $25 in most local stores, so it's a good saving buying at Amazon."
1,1-year fail - Poor quality,I usually have good experience with Tripp Lite but I will be replacing this cable as it is not reliable. The connector jacket on the large connector end does not provide a reliable connection as it fits loosely and disconnects intermittently. I've compared with other FireWire 800 cables and they fit very snugly and require effort to insert and remove providing a reliable connection. This cable fits loosely and even a minor shift in the cable will cause the device to disconnect. I bought this one because it was cheap. I got what I paid for. I will spend a few extra dollars and get a reliable cable for the connection between my camera and iMac for iMovie imports.
2,Not yet,"I have a Sony DCR HC30 camcorder (miniDV) and am trying to connect to my relatively new MacBook Pro using this cable. So far, the Mac does not recognize the camcorder. Seems like a nice cable, it's just not working for me, yet.Has anybody used this cable with a Sony miniDV with success?"
4,The correct cable for my MBP and MiniDV cam,I wanted to connect my MacBook Pro to my Canon HiDef MiniDV camera. This cable was what I wanted and it arrived quickly. Plug and Play.
1,Not recommended if you care about your camera...,"Based on the description and specifications of this cable in the listing, I expected it to at the very least work. I tested it across three cameras and two different computers. Upon getting a replacement from a local store (which cost $30.00) I found the new cable worked just fine with the same equipment. To make matters worse, the DV side (9 pin) was so tight in my cameras, it felt like it was going to destroy the port on the cameras.I am posting this unfortunately negative review as a warning to other would be buyers to BEWARE."
5,Exactly what I needed!!,"This firewire was exactly what I had been looking for. I went to Best Buy, Fry's, Radio Shack and then Apple. No one seemed to understand what I was needing. This wire fit my new mac book pro up to my Sony camcorder immediately. The shipment was quick. The price was very reasonable. The quality of the wire is heavy duty."
5,Great Cable for Less than $10!,"If you have a 2009 or newer Macbook Pro you have a 9pin Firewire connection on your laptop. Like most Mac users out there, I had trouble finding a 4pin to 9pin Firewire cable to connect my Canon HD video camera to my Macbook Pro. Nowhere in town seemed to have them. I found a few retailers online that wanted around $25, which I would have gotten, had I not found this one. Since this one was only $6, and it had really good reviews, I figured I would give it a shot. I am so glad I did! I ended up saving $15 over the other cables and this one is actually built really well. The connection fits nice and tight in my Macbook Pro and it seems really well built. Would definitely buy again if needed, and would recommend to anyone!"
5,Worked like a charm,"I read the other reviews about this cable before I bought it and that's pretty much what made my decision to get it. I used it to hook up my Sony camera to my new 17"" Macbook Pro and it worked with absolutely NO problems. In fact I was almost surprised how great it worked since I work in the video industry and run into cable problems all the time. Haven't tested it with another camera or computer, but definitely worked great for what I needed it for."
1,Wasted my money,Did not work with my camera and iMovie although my camera has the right port. My camera is a Sony miniDV camcorder.
5,Works as promised,"Having bought several firewire cables, only to find they did not work with my June 2011 iMac, I was pleased that this one did. the other end fits with the older firewire slot on an iMac that is about 4 years old. But if you have a brand new iMac, be assured it will fit."
5,works,The cales work as it should. No problems with compatibility. Not much more you can ask for in a product.
4,FireWire,this cable was good deal for a good price and works just fine.the delivery could have been faster.for such a small item.
5,Vast Improvment,"This games is a large improvment from the latest games. It restored the rightful effects and returns the control. The only thing is the wanted to make the pace go down. I personally am glad that they removed the password machine because it helps your deck building skills skyrocket and makes the games worth your time. Also it improved the AI of the duelists so it takes longer to beat, not 2 hours like Sacred Cards. Plus allows 3 decks so you can change for your opponents deck."
4,The Funnest game EVER Made!,"This Game is the best GBA game ever made. Even though I've never played it, because it hasn't been released yet. I know it has to be the bestest! My best friend's dad works for Nintendo and he's played the game and says it's ""uber"" cool. So go out and buy it Today! Ahhh I mean when it's released."
1,Not Worth The Money,"When I saw this game,I figured since it's the championship,it would be good.How wrong I was.You start of with Yuugi(Yugi),Ryou(Bakura),Honda(Tristan),Grandpa,Anzu(Tea).Beside their pics and names is the type of duelist they are.(eg.High ATK)You duel them ,and if you win,you pic a booster pack with about 5 new cards.It then sends you to your deck page,where you can edit and list your deck how you want to(as if that helps).There are two slots in the area where you find the duelists,apparently when you win a new character comes.I've been dueling each character and winning at least 5 times each.Those slots never get filled.So basically,you do the same thing over and over and over and over again.Buy Worldwide Edition Stairway to the Destined Duel or The Sacred Cards instead."
2,"Worth it?! YOU BET! If you believe me, look up Sarcasm!","This game is great having all the latest cards, yeah, but sadly with the loss of the password system, the game seriously lacks. They should've allowed us to create our decks, like the decks we own by adding the pass feature so we could put in what cards we have to make our deck.Otherwise, this game is too hard to understand in the deck building area and a little too hard to get the cards you want. If I were you, I'd buy Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the destined duel and get used to having only up to the LON boosters."
2,How to waste 30 bucks for nothing,"When I first saw this game I was attracted by how much it was hyped. ADVANCED AI!!!!! THREE DECKS!!!!!!!!!!! MORE OPPONENTS!!!!!!!! Don't be fooled. The AI was beyond advanced. It would pump up a monster, then sacrifice it for a weaker one. You'd find a much better opponent in a four year old. I would have usually been excited for more opponents, but here they just wasted my time. You need to duel someone over and over to unlock someone else. It just gets old. When I beat the final opponent I felt like chucking this game out the window. I am not risking my money by buying another yu gi oh game. EVER AGAIN"
5,Still relevant.,"Worth reading again for the clear writing, relevant viewpoint, and worthwhile viewpoints. It's always worth reading books that ""speak their minds."" Henry Ford not only spoke his mind, but he had a mind worth listening too."
4,"Interesting, like listening to Grandpa give you advice","Obviously this book is old and dated but most of Mr. Fords advice is still as relevant today as it was way back then. There are a few areas of the book you might raise an eyebrow but in general, the wisdom pours from the pages. Henry Ford's work ethic is second to none and it was also interesting to see how he felt about compensation of his employees. Of course, this book is only his point of view but if you read other biographies of Ford, you would get a different picture of his relationship with employees. Focusing on this book and this book only, his advice on many different subjects is invaluable and you should enjoy this book."
5,Henry's thoughts in todays world,"In reading the book I keep thinking what Henry was saying in 1922 could be said today. War profiteering, patriotism, interest rates, bureaucracy, education are all topics that sound so familiar in today's news. Henry had it right then in lots of ways and I think a lot of what he put forth it could be used in today's society."
5,The best business and economics book ever written,"Anyone who has read ""My Life and Work"" will understand exactly what is wrong with our country today. There are three ways to create wealth--grow it, mine it, or make it--and activities like flipping houses or trading carbon credits do not qualify.Ford developed what is now known as the Toyota production system, and readers will see a very explicit description of just in time manufacturing (and its benefits) in ""My Life and Work.""Ford also summarized effective labor relations in one sentence: ""It ought to be the employer's ambition, as leader, to pay better wages than any similar line of business, and it ought to be the workman's ambition to make this possible."""
3,Fun to read insights from a great industrialist,"This book, like a lot of books in their period, does not focus on one main subject but is a collection of articles/personal point of views on business matters. What struck me most is how ""uncluttered"" his mind is and his clear passion for doing things in the most efficient way possible. Granted, the writing style at that time can be a bit tedious and long winded, but he certainly does not mince words and his style is ""refreshing"" amidst all the jargons and words you see in today's business books and magazines. He shows that how an intensely focused on increasing the buying power of the customer, combined with a relentless desire to be as efficient as possible can be enormously benefiical to society. For me, it's interesting to compare him with Michael Dell's book ""Direct from Dell""...you'll be amazed with the striking similarities with both of their visions...only one is supplying a motor car and the latter personal computers."
3,Polisario Music,"The potential buyer should be aware that, while there is some very interesting, very good, music, this production is also a Polisario screed. Regardless of your position on the merits (and conduct) of the Polisario, the weaknesses of this music (and the booklet Kaiser liked so much) are the same weaknesses of all political tracts. Read the translated lyrics to CD 3 to be reminded of how poetry or lyrics in the service of politics (whether enlightened or not) is usually doggerel. Some of this music is transportative; some of it is the equivalent, regrettably, of doggerel."
5,Fighting Strong,"A Woman Scorn'd is a story about a woman who suffered being rape by her father at the age of thirteen to the point of losing her most priced possession, her innocence. But, she had a fight in her that she refused to let go of even after losing her mother at a young age.I enjoyed the way the author told this story through the main character, Roxane. After reading about Roxane and her ability to rise up from a bad situation, I was glad I bought this book, glad mostly that it had a fighting heroine in it. With all the adversities she faced in her present life and the past haunting her, Roxane managed to rise up and fight back for someone besides herself. Carrying a secret she couldn't share not even with her brother who was closest to her than anyone, this woman still reached out and helped the women she counseled. This is an excellent book by Dorothy Goins. Very motivating."
5,A Woman's Tale,"Every woman should read this novel. This novel tells the story of Roxane Brissett, a psychotherapist who not only makes house calls but also has an obstacle of her own to overcome. Her caring ways lead her to pour out her soul trying to help women who have been afflicted by abuse, women like herself. Being sexually abused by her own father at the age of thirteen manages to hold power over her throughout most of her adult life, but now Roxane must face her demons and help two women whose lives are shattered. Will she overcome her own issues? Roxane is a symbolic strength and the author does a wonderful job helping the reader see through her dilemma, the flaws of abuse within a family and the possibility of overcoming these social issues through forgiveness. I enjoyed this book immensely and recommend it as a read for women's groups and such. Goins is a dynamic writer. I wish to see more work from her."
5,Grippin',"I almost missed my stop on the bus. I like how the author let you feel the character's experiences. I was drawn in from the beginning to the end. This is a gripping story! You can't walk away the same after reading a novel like this. Miss Goins really put you in the story with the people she wrote about and when it was all over, I still wanted to be there. What a powerful book. I especially like Kenny. The author descriptions were so detailed. I will definitely check out other books by Dorothy Goins and that next novel she mentioned at the end of the book."
4,Profoundly Bold,"I could actually see the main two characters in this novel while riding high with their emotions. Talk about on point! This book is captivating and some of what Bernice went through with that crazy man made me want to scream, ""Get the hell away from him."" A Woman Scorn'd is told with such a bold voice, touching on a subject that is in the media just about everyday, this author wrote from the heart. I sensed the character's were real depictions or fabrications of someone close to her heart. I like this author's style of writing.This was like no other novel, I've read so far. Gripping from the first page to the very last. I'm sticking with this author to see what she drops next."
1,Maximum Ripoff,"$95 to watch some guy slap paint on a canvas for an hour just because he does it outside? Don't think so. More quasi-artistic ego than value here. Actual instruction was comparable to a string bikini, but didn't cover half as many essentials or present a tenth of the interest. Far superior material available at your local library for free. Save your money for something more useful, like Poke-mon memorabilia.Recommend this only to people I really don't like."
2,This was a disapointment.,"I was looking for a book on technical data for energy independent sytems, how they hooked up to your house, how it interacted with the existing power company system etc. This book has more opinion in it than information. I only read the first three chapters so far but the construction of all the chapters seem to be the same. It starts out with someone's story where they put down the power companies and insert a lot of ""save the Earth"" jargon. Most of the chapters consist of this type of rhetoric and at the very end of the chapter there is some useful information about a certain system, PV,wind, etc. I was also disappointed to find out that this book was copyrighted in 1993. The field of PV has taken leaps and bounds since this book was published. There is some useful information in this book but in my opinion, it could have been condensed into a short concise booklet of about 45 pages."
1,Product description incomplete; Amazon.com comes through,"The product description omits a critical piece of information: there is no microphone in the pendant, so the voice communications work only through the base. The range of the pendant (100"") tested out, but the voice communications did not. I checked with the factory and learned there is no microphone in the pendant, only in the base, and the claimed range for 2-way voice communications through the base is a maximum of 30' (assuming you are in the same room and can speak loudly enough and hear well enough from that distance)If there were minus stars I would give the seller -5 stars. The Amazon.com guarantee program and their personable representative get 5+ stars."
3,GOOD BUT NOT ENOUGH,"i thought it was a good book to start the installation, but i didnt understand a lot of things and they seem to be too geeky to explain, and so i just installed linux instead."
5,Getting The Band Back Together,"Great two-night viewing that inspires and provides great insight into the motives, the methods and the music of one of our generations greatest rockers. It was a very human story of musical integrity and a lifetime of friendships. My wife and I enjoyed it - especially the music throughout and the musings of Tom Petty as well as first hand band accoutns of over 30 years of band acrimony. It was especailly nice in Blue-ray!"
5,The excessive length is justified considering the subject,"I'm as big a fan of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers as the next guy, but I wondered whether any film about him could justifiably be four hours in length. I need not have worried.The story of Tom Petty is basically THE story of American rock music over the last four decades. He has played with musical gods such as Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, and Johnny Cash, and while he would be too modest to admit it, for my money he held his own with each of them. And let's not forget his incredible band, The Heartbreakers, who have never seemed to have gotten all of the credit that they have deserved.If you have even an passing interest in the man's music, check out this film and you'll come away impressed.I would also recommend the companion book, as well as the book of interviews, ""Conversations With Tom Petty."""
2,"Too much talk, not enough rock","There is a lot of great, classic concert material here. But sadly if you're a Petty fan, you won't get to watch more than brief snippets of it. Every single performance; from the first one in '06 to the great looking and sounding performances from Top of the Pops, Old Grey Whistle Test, Rockpalast, etc. IS CUT TO RIBBONS by whoever produced this. So you get maybe 30 seconds of music, then cut to an interview, then another 30 seconds, then another interview.Whoever put this documentary together doesn't think you want to watch an entire live Petty and the Heartbreakers song from start to finish, no matter how rare the material or great the song.Yeah, I admit there are three whole, uncut live songs on the second dvd. A whole dvd for three concert songs (not 3 concerts, three songs from concerts). Wow.Anyway, if you're just interested in talking heads and a bit of rock history, it's fine. If you want to see classic performances by a great band, look elsewhere."
2,just wasn't there,"not really happy with amazon for not sharing more on the videos i am trying to purchase. no contents available. this is just a documentary. very little music. a good documentary, but not what i was hoping for."
2,Too much talk not enough music!,"I was expecting a lot more of Tom Petty's music and was disappointed to find it was his life story instead of the music I enjoy. It is a very long video. I would not recomend this to anyone looking for music. His story is interesting, but how many times can you watch a persons life story? It was a waste of my money I have seen it and will likely not watch it again it will remain on the shelf. It seems like a waste of Blu Ray showing primarily interviews with musicians and not allowing the bands performances to showfree from interuption. It delves into his childhood and carries the story up to the present. Be aware before you purchase this video."
5,If U Love Petty,If U love Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers you WILL NOT be disappointed. Best Buy sells it for $29.99. I got it from Amazon for a cool $19.99!I've had his greatest hits CD in my car for months. Now I watch this DVD in my player at home A LOT! You get much more than great music. He's a VERY cool dude!
5,Very Slow,"But an amazing story of true events that transpired, and how God used one man to take the gospel to a people in their own language. Not the best production, but the story was inspiring to say the least and reminds you that with God all things are possible."
4,Great message!,"A little slow to begin with, especially for the teen ages!But the scenery is spectacle,r and the message of what one life can do for the kingdom of God is very inspiring!"
5,Amazing story,"God can use those who place their lives in His hands, just as He used one missionary, one copy of the Gospel of John, and one small boy who grew to a man and changed people's lives.Very special story."
5,Get it.....Readit......and you shall Have it!!!!!!!!!!!,"There are many times in life that you question yourself about your actions. One question I had about this book was it going to be able to teach me the things that I need to better myself. There is an expression that says every 1000 mile journey begins with the first step. I am alot closer to my goals in life by picking up this book. It is a must read for anyone who wants to learn from not only the best, but the ones who are experienced. John Assaraf has compiled the secrets that most know about but hardly implement. It is a must-have book if you want to accomplish greatness in your life."
3,Good guide,"The exercises are the most important thing in this book. You must do them to get anything out of it. This book is really similar to the tons of other sel-help books out there. But this will give you another angle to look at your goals and be successful. It's a very quick read. The book doesn't come with a magic pill to be successful, it just reinforces what you should be doing to be successful. I do like the exercises. They help one break down their past beliefs and replace them with new beliefs that will empower them. Good luck and Power to You!"
4,Quick Arrival,"Arrived quickly, in the shrink-wrap. The case however, was cracked. Not terribly so, but it's unfortunate since I bought this as a gift for someone. I'm still going to give it as a gift, but prefer my presents to be given in mint condition..."
4,Essential? Disputable. But a great compilation.,"Don't believe everything self-proclaimed Bob Dylan experts/purists say. I own every Dylan album up to ""Desire"" and find this compilation massively absorbing. And digital remasterization really did justice to some of the tracks. This is the best-sounding Dylan compilation yet. People can argue all day and night what should be on ""Essential"" Bob Dylan. Some people may come up with a 4-hour-long compilation and call it definitively essential. But that, even for most Dylan enthusiasts, can be at best tiresome and disorienting.And let's face it. There's nothing ""essential"" about Bob Dylan from the mid-70s on. I would take the first 9 tracks on Disk 2, add them to Disk 1 to make a 24-track single CD (although they won't fit on one with the conventional sound format) and call it ""The Essential."" For this reason, it loses a star."
5,Just what the doctor ordered,"This essential cd collection is just that, ESSENTIAL. Compact and concise. It spans every facet of Dr. Robert's career. Pick up this collection!!"
4,Just Fine for the Moderate Dylan Fan,"I bought this CD for just one song: ""Things Have Changed"" from the (less-than-wonderful) movie Wonder Boys. After listening to the entire 2-CD album, however, I was reminded of how much I had enjoyed Dylan's music in the 60's. Particularly welcome back into my life are ""Shelter From the Storm"" and ""Like a Rollin' Stone."" Dylan Aficionados will complain, but the CD is just fine for the moderate fan."
5,Dylan Through the Years,"This is quite a good mix of Dylan tunes. It makes a great compilation for a new Dylan fan or anyone wanting a taste of all his music through the years. There are songs I would have added, but that is personal taste. Great CD's!"
3,Essential?,"Q: Is it possible to capture essential Bob Dylan on ONLY two discs?A: No.Any Bob Dylan compilation absent ""Desolation Row"" is seriously flawed."
1,Aw for chrissake people!!,"Aw for chrissake people!! Just spent 10 or 11 bucks a pop on the newly released and remastered original albums. ITS BOB DYLAN!! There are plenty of superior album tracks on the original albums that these cuts are culled from. For example, you can't have appreciated Bob without ever having heard ""Visions of Johana."""
4,"Good collection, wish it could be mp3",Wish it could be mp3 as to not have to waste packaging.Common 'essential's..be enviro friendly :)
2,His best...if you call it that,I have over 2000 cd's and 100 records. So I am a fan of music dating back in to the blues of the 30s. Anyway I had never really owned any bob dylan...until now. This dual cd set is a good collection for the dylan first timer...but to me he still CAN NOT SING. I will admit the songwriting for 40 years ago was unique. But now I feel people collect dylan just to look cool or emulate some nostalgic respect.I will keep this cd but doubt I will ever play it again.I also bought blonde on blonde...even more disapointing.
2,how about shelter from the corn storm?,"I used to really like this guy. I liked him because it was my duty as a good hippie. I thought that maybe someday his words would become clear and mean something to me. I now see what a con his whole oeurve is. And that awful nasal whine! Yikes! If you're already a fan, then it's too late, but if you haven't yet delved into that sinkhole of time, money and effort, all I can say is ""bob's your uncle""."
5,OUTSTANDING,"This CD has Dylans early works to his latest, the best of. CD #2 of the set is awesome. Dylan is a creator, an artist with heartfelt words that touch your spirit, brings you to a place of contemplation. We still love you Dylan, after all these years. Reb in Seattle, Wa"
4,Not a bad sampler,"Let's face it ! We all have our own ideas about which tracks constitute ""Essential Dylan"" , but in any case , any self-respecting fan would already be in posession of whatever tracks he considers essential. This is not a bad sampler when you consider that it's intended for the uninitiated or apprentice-type fan , and taking into account that it contains some of the better , more recent material , it is probably a better buy than one of the 'greatest hits' collections."
5,"Take Me On a Trip, Upon Your Magic Swirling Ship...","This is an excellent career retrospective of Mr. Dylan's music. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone looking to be slowly introduced to the man's genius. He is a living legend, in my humble opinion, and hearing the words and music from these two discs just reinforces the idea in my mind. The songs are arranged chronologically, so one gets a glimpse of how the man has reinvented himself and his music over the course of his career. From the simple folk guitar and harmonica and socially relevant lyrics of ""Blowing in the Wind"" to the blues-tinged introspective examination of the human condition (in the later years of his life) in ""Not Dark Yet"" and ""Things Have Changed"", one journeys along with Dylan as he takes upon a trip through his 40+ year career."
4,Good but not for the deeper cuts,if your looking for the very basic dylan or just his hits youve come to the right place. if your looking for some deeper dylan your in the wrong place. i am only 14 but have been listening to dylan since i was 5 so i have seen all his stuff this is a good starter and memorobilia item
5,Cheated by the man and best buy.,"Any Bob Dylan fan will appreciate this album. The songs compiled here are without question amazing, the audio feed on the CD is good and the sound is completely flawless. I also appreciate this CD because it has so many songs on it, I'm sick of seeing best of CD's that contain only 10 songs. This allows you to get the best from all his CDs. I bought this album the other day at best buy for $25, and I sure wish I had looked at Amazon first because this price of $16 and some change is very very fair. This is the best price I think you are going to find on this CD, it being new that is. This CD will not disappoint a Bob Dylan fan, and also for anyone trying to get a quick run down on Bob Dylan this has a great line up of songs."
1,what language is he mumbling in?!?!?!?!?!?,"if he were to try and pull this hippy garbage today,he wouldnt even survive american idol.i can just picture him mumbling some horrible song and simon and co cracking up in tears!!!!!!him and william hung would complete for worst ''singer'' in the universe.those must have been some not only mind altering but ear defusing drugs back in the 60's !!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,what do these ''singers'' have in common with bob the hippy?!?!?!?,"lou reed,tom waits,macy grey,courtney love,ashlee simpleson,stevie nicks,gilbert gottfried(if he ever were to start ''singing''),roseanne barr,thom york jr from cold play,mick jagger,william hung(and every other american idol audition flunky),janet jackson(even with the volume on ten its hard to hear her weak voice(which is a good thing),j-notalent(samething as miss jackson),every rapper and rob thomas.....heres a hint......THEY ALL SOUND HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!! i dont know why people go crazy over someone who sounds so decrepid.the bob dylans of today are performing at a subway station near you with an empty coffee cups."
1,"Ugh, this is poetry?","Why oh why is this clown considered a poet? REAL poets are Lil' Wayne, Britney Spears, Nickelback, Staind or 50 Cent. I bet ol' Bob couldn't write poetry like ""I sit alone and watch the clock/Trying to collect my thoughts/All I think about is you"". See that poetry? It's ""Believe"" by Staind. And why doesn't this Dylan folk have any lyrics about clubs and booty-shakin'? What an old-timer. Tell him to get with the times or he's never going to get any BET airplay."
5,Mmmmmmmmmm.........TERRIFIC,"Bob Dylan is most certainly amongst the best singers of all time with more than 20 platinum albums and superb songs like BLOWIN IN THE WIND,LIKE A ROLLING STONE and SLOW TRAIN COMING.Pay no attention to the one star fool below me and get this classic.This collection is good so get it."
5,if you havent heard dylan before buy it!,"Even though a true greatest hits album for dylan would take atleast another double cd, these songs are amazing with most of them being masterpieces.A must buy for anbody curious about Dylan"
2,Received on time,Never opened until yesterday and it skips and skipspoor quality recordingskipsstopshave to change tracks manuallydisappointed
3,"oh, so much missing!!",Putting out a disk called the Essential Bob Dylan and leaving out Visions of Johanna and Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall is like putting out The Essential Zager and Evans and leaving out In the year 2525.
5,GREAT COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW,"Bashing Dylan's vocal skills as a means of arguing that he's not a great artist is kind of like complaining that Woody Allen isn't a versatile actor. If you have to resort to that, his talent is completely over your head. Look at this track list - 30 of the greatest songs in American popular music & he wrote every single one & had huge radio hits with many of them. Granted, there are versions of these tunes out there that surpass the original recordings in terms of sing-along-ability & pleasing listening. But that's hardly the point. So his poetry is not your thing? Then why come here & review an album you obviously haven't even purchased or listened to?? If anyone wants a wonderful summary of Dylan's repertoire, this is a CD set that can't be beat. And just look at that price! A+"
3,Pretty decent.,"Let's face it, folks. Two discs cannot, in any way, cover the highlights of Bob Dylan's career. If you're looking for one or 2 particular songs that your collection doesn't have or you only really like a few of his hits, this is for you. Otherwise, get yourself a box set or his albums up to Nashville Skyline (or both) and enjoy.This collection, on it's own merits, is pretty good. Disc 1 is fantastic. On Disc 2, however, the last 5 tracks are not truly worthy of being called his ""greatest hits"". Other than that, good buy."
4,Essential,"This CD is essential for a down-the-highway road trip. It's a bit pricey in the stores, so buy it on-line. Also, while everyone is entitled to their opinion on matters of music, the review below by Gaz Lowrab ""Open Heart"" has a factual mistake. ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" was originally written by Dylan, not the Byrds. The Byrds arranged it differently and made it a No. 1 in 1965."
2,CHANCELLORSVILLE,"Very disappointed with this book. Seems to be written for pre-teens or at least by a pre-teen . The story about the Brannon family is totally unbelievable. A Brannon at the left side of General Jackson, (when he was shot) and another Brannon brother Just happened to be on his right side. Historically seems sound, but overdone on the fictional side of the story. Not a Quality Book, reminds me of an old B movie put into print. DId anyone actually edit this book? I know the author never did. Needless to say, I will not Purchase any more of the series."
2,Too dark,"Currently I am a bit freaked out by the darkness of this book. Titus' father-in-law is turning out to be such an evil and creepy person, that to me, he makes the Civil War seem like a lark in the park. He is annoying and not enjoyable to read about.It was also not enjoyable reading about the Federal soldiers beating up a fellow officer along with an old civilian couple.Cory's friend, Pie, is an idiot, and it makes no sense that Col. Charles Thompson puts up with him.I have noticed that in our day, some people are still harboring ill feelings toward the Yankees for invading the South. It's funny that it is OK for the Texans to steal their land from Mexico. But it is not OK for the North to take over the South. It's OK to kidnap people and enslave them, but it is not OK for the North to free them.I would say, stop your whining, deal with it, and move on."
3,Adventures of an Elizabethan spy,"This is in the same general genre as Juliette Benzoni's Catherine and Marianne books, or Sergeanne Golon's Angelique: lavishly detailed romantic adventure stories centering around a woman. Deborah is an intelligent and beautiful young woman, carefully trained for a career as an agent of Elizabeth I of England.I found it rather mediocre. It was an entertaining enough read, but rather sloppily written, translated or edited. The heroine's hair is all shades of blonde and red, and it doesn't appear to be that she's dyeing it as a disguise. Deborah never really came alive to me.Not bad for whiling away a little time, but I wasn't interested enough to continue."
1,disgusting,"this toy just blows, no sound! NO SOUND! I couldn't believe it when we tried, its just a hollow tube. Going to get 10 that work for a dollar from dollar tree instead, what a let down."
2,Maybe it's me.....,"Like many people, I gave Jane Vandenburgh a try because of Anne Lamott's recommendation. It was not for me. I agree with the other reviewer who said it was too hard to follow, and I usually read difficult books as a former English major. I must admit I checked this out of the library and could not finish it, it's rare for me to abandon a book once I start reading it, but I couldn't force myself to get through it. Life is too short and I have too many other books in my ""to be read"" pile. In this pile right now, also from the library, is ""The Physics of Sunset"", also by Vandenburgh. We'll see if I like that any better, the 2 stars in my review is because the author can definitely write."
1,Ridiculous Book... hard to follow,"I didn't enjoy this book at all! I found myself struggling to get through it and forcing myself to read it. I thought this book was hard to follow as there were many flashbacks within flashbacks and you never really knew what was presently happening. I thought Katrinka's personality was mildy ridiculous considering her mental problem and her ventroliquism. This book really didn't have much of a plot, just the stupid idiosyncracies that Charlotte goes through growing up with her mother. Who couldn't write about that. I thought this novel was a total waste of time."
4,Let's see things differently,"This is the first book I've read by Bob Frissell. His style is direct and to the point. Great emphasis on self responsiblity and co-creater ability. Much of his truths are deep and bizarre, yet, them seem possible. And no harm is done by going way out with thought. I found that he always sent me back within myself to experience answers. Book was too short. I was enjoying it too much for it to be over so soon."
4,Entertainment Only.,"Hard to believe that many objective points in this book are ""true"" but since we're all creating our own reality you might get some neat ideas from this book. Then again you might not. I'm a sucker for multidimensional travel, and holograms just like the next guy but for some reason ""Ascended Masters"" always send up a red flag. Bob seems have gone the new age route this time, which is always a bad sign, but if you can sift through some crap there is some very interesting ideas about different types of consciousness from indigenous peoples to the coming golden age. So if this book falls out of a dimensional hole in the sky and into your hands, might as well check it out."
5,Nice holder,This is a handy product - makes it effortless to change the toilet paper. For those that say the arm squeaks or wish it was stationary - there is a set screw that can be tightened to hold the arm in place if desired. This is what we did and it works great.
2,Picture is prettier than the product,I was very disappointed when we received this. Moen is typically a solid brand known for quality. This item showed up and was very flimsy and did not have the weight I would expect from Moen products. I fear my kids are going to break it easily. Toilet paper falls off it constantly. They needed to put a better bend on the end to help hold the roll on. Not great from my perspective.
5,"Quick delivery, easy installaton","My wife and I recently remodeled a downstairs bathroom. When it came time to put things back together we decided to go with something different from the old, standard paper holder we'd been using. We looked both online and at local stores for an item. After reviewing and inspecting at least a couple dozen models, colors, etc. we decided on the Moen Danbury paper holder. It was by far the best value and the quality is every bit as good as items that cost twice as much or more. It's a good choice.Moen DN6708ORB Danbury Paper Holder, Oil Rubbed Bronze"
4,Great quality!,"Moen makes a great product and this is no exception. The only issue is that it squeaks when the arm moves (any time you use it). I'm sure if I oil the arm, it should take care of the issue.Well made piece and quality you'd expect from Moen."
2,Not oil rubbed bronze even though packaging stating so,I received this and immediately thought the wrong one was shipped. It was a dark gray color and no where near the oil rubbed bronze finish. I checked the packaging and it even said oil rubbed bronze. Surely I received a manufacturer screw-up b/c no one else has mentioned how much the color is off.
4,Looks great - but is very light weight,"Item looks wonderful, but the feel is very light weight and not substantial. Does not seem to be quality construction."
4,looks more black than orb,"I am overall happy with this product, but if you are looking for a true oil rubbed bronze, you may want to keep looking, because this is more of a solid black."
5,"Beautiful, durable, easy","I was unsure if I would like an open roll holder, but it is so nice and easy to use, especially for children. Also looks much better than those kind with the spring inside the roll."
4,Good Buy,Good value for money. We purchased this and had it shipped to the UK as we could not find this specification or anything similar for our bathroom. Ideally we'd have liked to have a choice of fittings to choose from in this set. We are pleased with the quality.
2,do NOT use for Blacberry JAM even with berry screen,I have been looking and looking for something to take ONLY the seeds from my blackberries for my jam this year. I finally decided on this after tedious hours of researching the best thing to do this. I give up!! Will eat the jam with seeds. Used the berry screen (purchased for and extra 15 bucks) and it took all my pulp with it. So if you want jam its a no go. However if you are wanting to make jelly it would be perfect. Will update after i use to make my spaghetti sauce.
4,great item!,"My wife and I recently purchased a ""back to basics"" food strainer and sauce maker. In years past, it had been a real pain to prepare the tomatoes into a sauce. (We grow our own and have had abundant quantities.) This year it took less than a third of the time and a lot less mess. Although nothing in this world is perfect, this item comes close. The only complaint I have is this: after using the strainer, it is close to impossible to remove the hopper base from the main body. I have oiled each piece befrorehand and it still is stuck on there. Any suggestions? Other than that, this is a great invention!"
2,Surprising Fault,"We ordered this to make applesauce. It made a wonderful batch and was easy to clean. However, when we got it out the box to make another batch the next weekend, we discovered that the clamp that attached it to the counter had stripped such that we had to hold it in order to process the apples. We over-clamped it with some c-clamps but had to return the item."
3,Frustrating,"I bought this machine to replace my Norpro Saucemaster that I've had for many years. The Back to Basics one had a few features that I thought were improvements to my saucemaster, but I found out it has one HUGE flaw, the little c-clip. It comes off every 2-3 minutes and goes through the machine. I then have to dig through the waste, and disassemble and then reassemble the machine. Talk about annoying. The B2Basics machine does have the waste extension that I love (eventually will break, and I like the way the strainers go on. But I have stopped using it and went back to my old saucemaster just because of that little .50 cent c-clip."
2,It's ok,"I got this a few years ago, and am not really impressed with it. First the hopper- it promptly melted the first time we used it. They gladly replaced it for free. But I don't like the 2 piece connecting design. Every time you bump the hopper, whether when filling it or just turning the handle, it lets juice leak out. And it makes a much bigger mess then needed, not to mention wasting juice. It does the job, but it just is not the quality of a Victorio Brand strainer. The tabs on the waste extension are breaking, and the juice slide thing doesn't sit on it right, never did. I'd say spend the few extra $$ and get a better machine. I am looking to replace mine as soon as I have the $$."
3,C clip problems,"I have had this food mill for a year and a half. It worked wonderful in the fall for apples but now that I am processing tomatoes I keep bending the c-clip. It is a relatively inexpensive fix but it is aggravating nonetheless. I will say that overall I am pleased and it is very easy to clean and set up, I just wish I could process more than 5 lbs of tomatoes without bending the c-clip."
4,Takes most of the work out of making sauce.,"This is like a dream come true when you have a lot of tomatoes to skin and seed. It worked great for the first 1/2 hour but after a while the skins clogged on the screw inside. I cleaned it out and back to work. All in all, this is a great tool for making sauce. The time it saves is well worth to price. I would recommend this item."
5,Works great,"This does exactly what we need it to do. We've made grape jelly and tomato sauce, so far. We will be using it even more as we come into the growing season."
3,Okay,It is an OK product for small jobs.It has too many plastic parts.I'm surprisesd I haven't broken something yet.I would not buy again. Spend the money and get a heavy duty one.
1,Defective,"The red spiral auger broke almost immediately the first time I tried to use this product, despite being used with soft fruit and only gentle pressure. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,tomatoes came out great,"just used the ""back to basics 220 strainer"" and the results were wonderfulthe machine is well built, and the instructions were made designed the way you could follow them easily. most products i buy, the instructions do not have empathy for the user who must assemble and use the product.it worked great on the tomatoes. the seeds, peels and core came out the ""discard end"" and the pure ""pulp juice"" came out the front. i processed 200 tomatoes without a problem. bang for the buck, you can't beat the production this machine will give you the tomato season"
4,Works Great,"It works great, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is the clamp to hold it should be bigger I had a hard time finding a table to put it on, but after I got it set up everything was fine."
5,Love this!,I received this item in very good condition and quickly. Have never used a strainer before nor made apple sauce. It was easy to put together. My almost 3 year old grand daughter was able to help turn the handle and push in the apples. She was very proud of herself. I was able to can my first applesauce.
1,Not a good item,"My wife and I make a lot of applesauce, berry jams, etc. So I was very excited when I ordered this unit.It 'looked' good, however i was disappointed when I unpacked the unit. The strainer was bent at the outlet. I did not think it would affect the performance, however I soon found out that was a mistake.On my first run, warmed cooked apples, I loaded up the hopper 1/4 of the way full, and started cranking. Everything seemed OK, however nothing was coming out of the hopper. Then it got harder and harder to turn. Then the whole strainer popped off the unit. What a mess.I'm going to save my money and buy an all metal fruit strainer."
3,Company Phone # Disconnected,"The product itself worked great. However, we only used it twice before a little piece broke off the plastic spout. I tried calling the phone number listed in the booklet that came with the food mill to see if they could send a replacement but it has been disconnected and I can't find a new number to call."
4,Probably the best of the Donut Man videos,"This video does a very good job of connecting the scriptures with a real-life problem: Jonathan's not wanting to take care of his little brother and sister during the club's zoo outing (and similar attitudinal issues that come up!). The Donut Man (Rob Evans) brings scripture and songs to bear on the problem in a creative and fun way, but, more importantly, a way that shows the solution in repenting, turning to Christ, and having faith for obedience."
4,Strawberry Shortcake Murder,"Book is better than the first (2) I read. Less characters, easier to follow...and the main character...has more tight squeezes to get out of! Reads alot faster!"
2,Strawberry Shortcake Murder,"Strawberry Shortcake Murder was the first of this series I have read. While I do appreciate the lack of graphic detail and foul language, it is by far the worst example of writing I have seen since reading my children's middle school attempts at creative writing. Who was the editor?? How did s/he let so many annoying overuses of both proper nouns and pronouns get into print? The author needs to work on writing in a more mature conversation style for her adults. The plot is okay, but the constant interfering of Hannah & others in an actual police investigation is not plausible. The author also needs to be more realistic in the day schedules of working people. Just for an example, a dentist wouldn't have time to go home in the middle of the day to process & print camera film."
