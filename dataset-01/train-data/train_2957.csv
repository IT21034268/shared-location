1,"Actually, no stars, were there the option....",I would just like to point out the fact that the word TRAINED is actually in the TITLE of this book. This comment is directed at anybody who asserts that Ezzo is not promoting child TRAINING (as I read in one review).
5,works for us!,"All I know is it works for us...we have a very happy (and rather chubby) baby who slept through the night first at 6 weeks, then consistently by 11 weeks (more than 7 hours). The schedule makes sense, is flexible and we've never let our baby cry for ""hours on end,"" nor even close to an hour!I think it's great for working moms who can't afford to still be waking up in the middle of the night once they go back to work! I feel it teaches wise, common sense-type thinking."
1,Not a fan of the philosophy,"We have friends who are BIG BabyWise supporters and they encouraged us to read the book. The more I read about parenting and the more experienced of a parent I became, I realized that I am not a fan of parent-led childrearing. My husband and I decided to practice a more child-led approach. This book is very big on scheduling your child's life (especially naptimes) rather than living around your child's schedule. We have found life to be much easier when we go about our day around our son's natural schedule. My husband also didn't like the lack of proof and fact with this philosophy. There were a lot of statements made with little to back it up. It really depends on what type of parent you are. If you don't know, I would highly recommed that you read this book and ""The Baby Book"" by Dr. Sears, since they are polar opposites you'll be able to find where you fit in the broad spectrum of parenting."
1,Book is Medically Inaccurate,"This book alarms me because it makes medical claims that are in direct conflict to recommendations of lactation consultants, US Department of Health and the AAP on breastfeeding. These guys may be well intentioned parents, but they are not experts on breastfeeding. Please read other books. One lactation consultant who says she has read every book out on breastfeeding recommended ""Breastfeeding Made Simple: Seven Natural Laws for Nursing Mothers"". This is a medically accurate, simple read that puts everything you need to know into 7 simple facts.I feed my 4 month old successfully ""on demand"" and we get plenty of sleep and he gets plenty of milk. In the beginning he ate more unpredictably, but it is not hard to plan or go places now as his tummy is bigger and he can go longer without eating.Breastfeeding Made Simple: Seven Natural Laws for Nursing Mothers"
3,Didn't work for us.,"We got some good tips from this book but when we tried to follow its plan it caused some big problems! We had to hybrid this theory to make it work.If you read this book for ideas it's good, if you read it for a parenting plan you're in for trouble. NEVER BLINDLY APPLY A THEORY TO YOUR PARENTING because all kids are different!"
1,Don't be scared into implementing this advice...,"This book tries to scare you that if you don't follow these harsh methods you are in for a couple years of sleepless nights with a demanding, fussy child. Not only did the advice from the authors (both men) go against my natural instincts, I began to become suspicious that my own baby would begin sleeping through the night naturally right around the timeframe that is given. Sure enough, that was the case, and I had abandoned the Babywise system as unrealistic, cruel and useless after just a few days."
3,Get it before the baby comes,I think this book would have been a great help if we had read it before our baby came. We agree with what this book has to say and what our friends have told us after reading this book.Life became so busy after our baby came. When we needed to start implamenting the techniques; we were reading.
2,not easy to read,"i expected more practical advices, but you have to read the entire book i guess , i didn't find it helpfull, to much stuff, all i need it i could find it online without paying for this book. all i have to say it was ok."
3,Read before the baby arrives,"This book had some good tips but please buy before you have your baby. After a few sleepless weeks I desperately ordered any book I could find on putting babies to sleep but by the time they arrived and I found some time to read them, my daughter & I had already worked out our own system."
1,"Linked to failure to thrive, dehydration, and failed milk supply.","Please be aware that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued a statement warning parents about this method of feeding/scheduling/sleep training. The Babywise method has been linked to failure to thrive and dehydration in babies, and to low milk supply in mothers (resulting in involuntary early weaning), among other problems.The author, Gary Ezzo, is a self-proclaimed parenting expert. Do some research and see what you find. A quick google is all it takes.Here is the AAP's statement on newborn feeding: (AAP Policy Statement, ""Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk,"" Pediatrics, Dec. 1997): ""Newborns should be nursed whenever they show signs of hunger, such as increased alertness or activity, mouthing, or rooting. Crying is a late indicator of hunger. Newborns should be nursed approximately eight to 12 times every 24 hours until satiety."""
5,Great Book!,"A friend recommended this book so I bought it! In all honesty there are tons of baby books out there for me I needed a book that gave me the next steps of how to take care of a newborn. This book does just that. The book is honest and realistic in what mothers can expect. The book also explores and explains other feeding and sleeping methods. This is my first child and I appreciate the up front knowledge this book provides. This book is not for everyone in all honesty. However, if you are a parent who wants to maintain some since of structure in your household and a life with balance I recommend this book for you."
1,ZERO stars from me...,"Before deciding to follow these methods, I recommend that you do some research. Also, to balance out the extreme lack of parent-child bonding info, I would recommend reading any book by Dr. William Sears, who, unlike the Ezzo's, actually has some experience in dealing with babies!"
1,burn this book!!!,"WORST BOOK EVER written for babies, this man is not a doctor, and your baby will be seriously harmed if you use this book. I have personally seen the long term results of parents who use the Ezzos parenting advice and it is disastrous. this man should be placed in jail for advocating infant abuse and neglect. please do not buy this book and if someone gives it to you BURN IT!!!!"
2,Not good for moms who want to breastfeed,"This was the only book we read before we had our daughter and I wish I would have done some more research, read a couple other books, and known a few more approaches/perspectives to choose from. I really wanted to breastfeed exclusively and at 6 weeks we had to start supplementing with formula because she was not gaining weight. I wish I would have read a good breasfeeding book like ""Breastfeeding Made Simple"" to get a little better informed before I started out. I truly believe that trying to put my daughter on a schedule in the first 4 months while my supply was being established ruined my chances for exclusively breastfeeding my daughter. I continued breastfeeding while supplementing until my daughter was 15 months old and I am glad I did, but as I am currently pregnant, I will definitely go another route with this little one. My advice: Educate yourself and have another option available if one style doesn't work for you."
1,DONT DO THIS TO YOUR BABIES!!!!,"This book is a very bad book. It has been condemmed by the AAP, and many other organizations. Failure to Thrive (FTT) has been shown to be a part of many MANY babies that have had to endure this ABUSE. Yes, I said ABUSE!! Thats what this book wants you to do, is abuse your infant!! PLEASE, PLEASE dont put your poor sweet babies through this. They long to be held, they deserve to be snuggled and rocked, they will be much happier when you do what YOU feel is right. Do a search on google.com, just type in babywise, you will be shocked by what you find."
1,Try attachment parenting instead,"Before you commit to this dangerous and misguided book, you should compare it to the alternatives. Check out the book, ""Attachment Parenting: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child"" by Katie Allison Granju and ""Our Babies, Ourselves"" by Meredith Small. Why would a parent want to allow her baby to cry and go hungry simply out of convenience? The only thing this will teach your baby is not to trust anyone."
1,On Becoming Baby Wise,"Before investing in this book or any of the Gary Ezzo or Growing Families International materials, read the dangers of his parenting program through google and then go to Ezzo or Baby Wise or Growing Kids God's Way. These materials have been deemed dangerous by many respected sources including Focus on the Family, The Christian Research Institute and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The parent demand feeding schedule for newborns has been deemed dangerous and can lead to failure to thrive, low birth weight, dehydration, lactation difficulties, sleep deprivation and even depression."
1,Damaging,"I was given this book by a friend and was incredulous that this man could actually have a following. Teaching parents to ignore their instincts and attempt to make their infants conform to hard & fast schedules regardless of need is simply awful. First time parents, especially, are always second-guessing their decisions and this load of bunk feeds right into that.Parents, trust your instincts. Hold your babies. Soothe them when they cry. There's time enough when they're toddlers to worry about schedules & following directions!"
1,...,"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!This book encourages parents to ignore their babies cries, thus teaching them that no one will respond to their needs. Yah, they probably *will* stop crying after a while! They'll eventually figure out you're not going to come soothe them or feed them. Dont you think that infancy is a little early for such harsh treatment?? I do. It's a fact that babies rely on their parents for just about all of their emotional needs. They need us to make them feel safe and secure. This book teaches babies that their needs are second to ours, no exceptions. It is frighteningly reminiscent of pet training manuals. Hey, babies are people too! Give them a break already! Give them a hug and rock them back to sleep! ...Ezzo actually teaches DISCIPLINE in this book. If you still have to buy into his vile cruel method, please at least ignore the discipline segment. There is NEVER a good reason to hit a baby. (Ezzo describes how to smack an infant on the thighs to avoid leaving marks, no joke.) ...."
1,"Technique OK, but it's a very poorly written book","I recommend the Baby Whisperer book over this one by a mile. The basic philosophy is the same, but the Baby Whisperer is SO much better written.Ezzo spends the first 100 pages trying to convince you that his method is the way to go, which is pretty pointless because if you've got the time to read that much then YOU'VE ALREADY BOUGHT THE BOOK because you're suffering from sleep deprivation with the new baby and just want some relief.Every page further I read without him getting to the point just annoyed me more and more. He finally does get close to the point after the aforementioned hundred pages but he continues to repeat stuff from earlier in the book, sometimes even whole paragraphs. We GET it already, cut to the chase, gimme the lowdown, etc.The technique is reasonable and sound, but it's so much better delivered in the Baby Whisperer."
1,Not in your best interest,"I wouldn't recommend this book if my life depended on it or and I wouldn't give it to my worst enemy. After what was probably a good intention from my husband's friend, we tried this approach and I absolutely hate it. I read the entire book and read several others -- Baby Whisperer, Best Baby on the Block, etc. -- and used what I felt to be appropriate -- along with my maternal instincts. I had doctors and lactation consultant stress their disapproval of the Baby Wise book. I have a healthy, happy baby who sleeps through the night since week 10 consistently. The primary provider needs to be making the decisions as to what's best for the baby, not a book."
2,Not for everyone...,"I'm the mother of a five-month-old and a friend recommended this book to me shortly before he was born. I started reading while in labor and grew very excited about becoming a PDF mother. However things didn't go as described in this book and I found myself at a loss. The book is light on details and doesn't give any options when things don't work as they describe. I'm glad that I'm flexible because this could have left me feeling inadequate in the end. Another friend sent me The Baby Book by Dr. Sears and while I really don't agree with the ""Attached Parenting Style"" I was at least comforted by the volume of information provided.Bottom-line this book has it's shortcomings and is not for everyone."
4,this was a lifesaver to me,"I was 40 when I had my first and only child. She was difficult to say the least. I had no frame of reference from which to draw from and lived away from any relatives that could help me. I was raising this baby without a clue and utterly by myself. She cried all the time and I rarely got any sleep. Can you say, depression? I literally felt like I was going to loose my mind. An aqaintance gave me this book and said that it saved her life. I devoured this book in a few hours. It made sense to me and made my life so much easier. I finally got some information that eased my overwhelming load of new motherhood. Thank God!P.S. Who cares if the author is not a medical doctor? Medical doctors dont know anything, except what they were taught in medical school. They are only good for one thing, writing out a prescription. I put no trust in them."
1,Not a Fan,"I read this book from beginning to end. Based on my review of literature this author cites, and my background as a physician, I do not agree with his conclusions. I do not find his methods effective. I also do not think it is true that mothers who engage in attachment parenting are exhausted. However, maybe I am an attachment parent and thus would never agree with him. Who knows."
3,Helpful book for a first time mom,This book gave me some good ideas on how to take care of my newborn infant and to read his cues. I really liked the part about putting your baby on a feeding schedule right from the beginning - that helped me a ton! I didn't like everything that the book said so I just took what I liked and ignored the rest. It was a good book and I'm glad that I read it.
1,Do your research before you follow this advice,"I wish I had known before I bought this book that the American Academy of Pediatrics and most baby experts are strongly opposed to the methods in this book. It goes against all natural instincts you have to care for your baby and instead teaches rigid schedules that are convenient for the parent, regardless of the baby's needs. I did more research on this before following it and found that some babies actually have to be hospitalized when the parents follow the feeding advice since they are undernourished. I was really hoping to find good information on getting my baby to sleep, but it's only a small part of the book anyway, and not very good ideas at that (put your baby in the crib and let him cry). I ended up throwing this book away and buying a more compassionate one called The No-Cry Sleep Solution. My baby and I are both much happier."
1,Technique may be damaging to infants,"I read this book and utilized its techniques after being recommended by a family member who had also used the technique with their HEALTHY infant. This technique did not work at all for my son because he was sick often with ENT issues. Although my family member used this technique successfully with their first child, it did not work at all with their second child because of his health issues.What I have learned by having my first child is that you can NOT spoil them, and they NEED love, attention and affection which entails holding them, rocking them, and spending time with them as much as possible. If you discuss the various methods in this book, they are not supported by any of the pediatricians or child health/psychology professionals I have discussed this with."
3,"Nice Ideas, But How Do You Use Them?????","Positives:The idea of the sleep, eat, play schedule is A LOT better than nursing them to sleep, because they become dependent on this to fall asleep. Right now, we are trying to break our child of the habit of always needing to eat to fall asleep, but we can't quite figure it out.Negatives:If you don't start this practice from birth, I believe there are three useless pages on how to implement this plan from an older ago. Not helpful.It doesn't really explain how to calm a crying baby, etc. It just seems to assume that your baby will be put down, cry a little, and follow the method perfectly. It doesn't tell you what to do if something goes wrong.This is a nice idea, but there isn't actually enough information on what this kind of ""schedule"" looks like. There was one example, but it didn't clarify things enough."
3,interesting,"An interesting read, but requires parents to consult their common sense before using any of the information from this book."
3,Baby Wise,"I read a little of this book, it was recommended to me by one of my good friends and she said it was a really great book. I think it would be a good book to read before you have the baby, and then re-read shortly after the baby. We were having a hard time getting my son to sleep and we ordered this book, however we started swaddling him differently and that fixed the sleeping problem."
2,Long and Repetitive,"While I agree with much of what Ezzo's theory teaches, the book is long and repetitive for what he's trying to get across: the baby should sleep, eat, wake.Let me summarize even further: Don't let your baby sleep immediately after feeding.Also, I agree with another reviewer that Ezzo's background as a Christian Evangelist should be made known/clear in the book. I think it's important to know what kind of person you are taking advice from, and outside influences that might impact their opinions."
1,Heart Breaking,"I can honestly say that my heart felt like it was breaking as I read details about this book. Everything I have heard about this book goes against natural parenting instincts when caring for a newborn. My own daughter is nine months old now, and began sleeping through the night around 5 or 6 weeks old (7-8 hours straight), and we co-slept and fed on demand. Babies cry because they NEED something. Please please don't ever think that leaving a baby to cry is an okay thing. It's Not. Ever."
1,CHECK THIS WEBSITE BEFORE PURCHASE,"[..]I'm not sure I'd want to listen to advice on parenting from a ""Christian"" who has been excommunicated from more than one church. Also, his children no longer speak to him! Some of the methods may ""work"", but what are they doing to your baby? Babies need to know they can trust their parents. Please, for your child's sake, read The Happiest Baby On The Block in addition to this, and go to the above website- hopefully, it will help you see why this book is BAD NEWS."
5,Babywise,This product is wonderful!! In the beginning I was a little skeptical that the methods in Babywise would work. After 2 weeks I was convinced. My twins have been sleeping through the night! I know what to anticipate based on their actions and/or cries. We have a schedule for them that makes everything predictable for both my husband and I and the babies!! I can't wait to receive the next in the book series!!!
1,Dangerous for your baby,"This book is filled with unsubstantiated ""medical"" advice and has been linked to children failing to thrive. I felt nothing but horror at a book telling me not to feed my baby when he was hungry and not to hold him."
1,HOw to abuse your baby,"I don't even want to give any stars for this book. His research clams are flawed. Many, if not ALL, child development experts warns against his method of raising a baby. You are putting your baby at risk for death and/or permanent emotional damage if you follow this book. American Academy of Pediatrics has written a formal warning against this book. Many doctors have seen ""failed to thrive"" babies due to this book. This book is for parents who wants to raise their baby by forcing the baby into their lifestyle instead of understand baby's nature. As a Christian mom, I highly disagree with this book. The author is kicked out from the church where he was an associated pastor. HE's not even ordained. Many christian doctors, pastors warns against this book. You are setting yourself for bad parenting practices."
1,Do your research before you follow this advice,"I wish I had known before I bought this book that the American Academy of Pediatrics and most baby experts are strongly opposed to the methods in this book. It goes against all natural instincts you have to care for your baby and instead teaches rigid schedules that are convenient for the parent, regardless of the baby&#65533;s needs. I did more research on this before following it and found that some babies actually have to be hospitalized when the parents follow the feeding advice since they are undernourished. I was really hoping to find good information on getting my baby to sleep, but it&#65533;s only a small part of the book anyway, and not very good ideas at that (put your baby in the crib and let him cry). I ended up throwing this book away and buying a more compassionate one called The No-Cry Sleep Solution. My baby and I are both much happier."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book was not written by people with appropriate training -- medical or otherwise. Their methods, especially with regard to food restriction, have led to dehydrated and undernourished babies. If you want to read some useful books that will get your baby the food and sleep he needs AND eventually result in a wonderful routine read Dr. Weissbluth's Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child (on sleep) and any of the books by Ellyn Satter on food."
3,Very Ridgid,"As a new Mom, I was grasping for so much advice. There were some great points in this book and it did help me establish a better routine. But, I remember reading some pretty extreme advice, like, don't rock your baby to sleep in a rocking chair EVER, or they'll never fall asleep any other way. Really?"
4,None,This book saved my sanity when my twins refused to sleep. They quickly got onto a sleep eat play routine and became happy instead of always cranky. However it doesnt work for all babies. My youngest just wasnt going for the routine. it took several months to find a smooth schedule for him. You dont have to follow this scientifically. take what works for you and find other resources as well.
1,"Dangerous, inaccurate information","All parents should know that this book and its sequel are full of advice that leading pediatricians and parenting specialists reject. While some parents have had success with the program, it can lead to malnourished, listless, unhappy babies. In addition, the author of Babywise has manipulated scientific studies to suit his purposes. In many cases these studies were authored by people who have publicly spoken out against the Babywise advice. The list of pediatricians and ""parenting professionals"" who recommend the books has also been manipulated. Some of the people on it have not read the books or disapprove of its contents. For an in-depth analysis of the dangerous practices of this book, read the article in the Mothers column of the online magazine Salon at http://www.salonmagazine.com/mwt/. You can do a search in the archives by the date of the article, 8/6/98. The title of the article is ""Getting Wise to Babywise."""
5,EXCELLANT! EXCELLANT! EXCELLANT!,"I highly reccomend this book to first time parents, it has been a lifesaver for us. We first learned about this book when our son was eight weeks old,I was suffering from the ""baby blues"", we had no order in our lives whatsoever, I was demand-feeding my baby and was miserable. I could not get anything done (cleaning,cooking,laundry etc.). My son would take 15 min. cat-naps all day, and would wake 2-3 times during the night to eat. Since applying the principles of Baby Wise our son takes 3-4 2 hour naps a day and sleeps for a continous 10-11 hours at night. This book has in no way been a danger to our son, and I would reccomend it to anyone!"
1,Agree with the previous review,"He takes what seems to be a good theme, ""Help develop good sleep habits"", and twists it with poor parenting as well as misleading adivise for those who want to breastfeed their baby. It is not compatible with those parents who want to nurture their child and help to develop a relationship of trust."
1,book by a quack,"Babies have died as a result of the ""information"" in this book.He has no medical credentials and is not condoned in any way by the AAP."
1,Take some parenting classes America!,"How very sad that a book like this is received so warmly by American parents. What a perfect example of how lazy and self-centered we are as a nation. God forbid a baby would ""inconvenience"" anyone by waking at night. After all, physiologically babies have stomachs that only hold 1-2 teaspoons at one time and have a physical need to wake up every 2-3 hours for food until they are older. Of course these babies appear content! Have you ever starved yourself and eventually your stomach (this is a no brainer) shrinks therefore, you eventually are less hungry. Ask any PROFESSIONAL Pediatrician how wonderful (not!!) this book is.....we are seeing a mass exodus of failure to thrive babies on this psychotic program! Get a puppy future wanna' be parents.....or better yet a golfish....you're obviously ""too busy"" to be bothered by rasing children!"
1,Prevented nursing my fifth child,"As a sleep-deprived mom of five under age 8, I foolishly followed the advice in this book. As a result, I was unable to produce enough milk - for the first time, after nursing the first four children an average of 10 months each. If you really want to breastfeed, please don't follow the Ezzo's advice."
1,"Did not realize this was a platform for religious propaganda, etc","[...]that website pretty much sums it up. The AAP rightly condemns this book for promoting tactics that can lead to failure to thrive and severe dehydration. It's also one of several books by these authors, and most of the others are heavily religious, something I did NOT realize when gifted this book.My thoughts are pretty much along the lines of everyone else here who gave it a super low rating: It's extreme, severe, controlling, unempathetic, inflexible (despite what they say, there is little room for flexibility within their system), and based on imposed morality rather than humanity.There is some decent basic info here, but none that can't be found in a more humane form by someone who's actually got some kind of medical training or at the very least endorsements from pediatric organizations.Ezzo's own children are apparently estranged, and by the tone of this and other of his works, I'm not surprised."
1,Will work if you have a perfect baby .... ..,I had all the intentions of using the plan in this book but my daughter was born 2 weeks early and extremely high need and fussy. Here I was a new mom trying to do this schedule and follow all the advice. I would finally get her to sleep and then wake her up to eat because this book said so. This book works for a baby born with a perfect disposition or at the 12-16 week mark. Make sure you have other books on hand!
5,Babywise really works,"As a new mom and clueless to the world of newborns, I was anxious to learn a way to get my daughter to sleep well at night-- and thus let me get a good night's sleep. I feel that I am a better mom throughout the day from getting good sleep all night.I would encourage all new parents (or veteran parents with a new baby) to read this book. It really isn't that difficult, but you have to be open to new ideas. Caring for a newborn involves so many emotions, but instead of running with a bottle or nursing at every whimper, I try to analyze what it is my daughter really wants. She may just be ready for a nap or cold. Based on the recommended sleep-wake-eat cycle, I am able to better determine what she needs at that particular moment. It takes away my indecision and gives me greater confidence.I have a delightful, happy daughter and based on her excellent sleeping and eating habits, I would HIGHLY recommend Babywise to all parents."
4,Great advise,"I've used this theory with all three of my children. However, I did not follow everything to a tee. This book provides good guidance, but you have to decide how strict you are going to follow the ""rules"". I waited until 3 months to start a feeding/sleeping schedule and all three kids fell into the routine fairly easily."
3,Good Idea's but too confusing,"This book has good plans of helping your baby sleep though the night, however, the first problem is the ""Babbling"". It seems as though the author jumps from one thing to another making his points confusing. For those of you Pre-reading before your little one comes, dont bother. Your child is different and may require different choices. Whats more important, giving your child what IT needs, or choosing to do it the books way."
3,Good in theory,"A friend of mine gave me this book, and I have been following the Babywise theory with a few modifications . I followed the book strictly at first , fed my newborn every 3 hours , and I must admit my son was sleeping through the night at 5 weeks ! Although , I tottaly disagree with putting your newborn child to sleep cold turkey !!! It took hours of crying to get my baby to sleep , after being traumatized he slept beautifully all night . I used Dr Brazelton's theory of putting your child to sleep when they are realexed and allready quite sleepy , if they do cry then you comfort them every 3 to 5 minutes . This worked much better for my son ! He is now 4 months and going to bed is'nt scary and Mommy and Daddy are also happy ! Other than that , I would recommend Baby Wise . There methods for everything else ,like estabilishing a good routine is great. This book can be very helpfull if you use your best judgement as a parent."
4,With a grain of salt...it works,I have just had my third child and this is the first child I have used Baby Wise with and I must say it was a nice surprise. Having 2 younger children in the house the book provided guidelines to structure the baby's day so my other 2 were not left high and dry when the baby wakes up or needs to be fed. My baby is 8 weeks old and he sleeps 7-8 hours per night and is very content during the day. I wish I would have had it for my first but am certainly glad I had it for my third.
1,Night Nursing: Nature's Way,"When my pediatrician advised me to begin sleep training my baby, I did my research. Prolactin, essential to maintaining milk supply, is generated in greater quantities during night nursings. Why would nature make this so? Lactoferrin, a compound found in breastmilk but NOT in formula, kills the strepmutans that cause tooth decay, so rather than being detrimental, night brestfeeding PREVENTS tooth decay. But never mind Nature's design: do the CONVENIENT thing so you can watch your favorite TV programs ON SCHEDULE."
2,controversial,"The book came quickly and in great shape. The first chapter was interesting and seemed to take a fairly moderate approach, but then a friend showed me the wikipedia review of the book. Apparently the Baby Wise methods have been linked to malnutrition in the baby and other things. I haven't finished reading the book yet, so I cannot give a fair review until I do so."
1,wrong book received,you sent the wrong book - not even close - of course who is going to mess aound sending it back. What a waste of money.
1,What's the Controversy?,"If you are a concerned parent or parent to be, go to:www.ezzo.infoVERY THOROUGH and the best website I've seen on this."
1,Not recommended,"This book my be dangerous if followed too closely, especially for breastfed infants. It is also cruel to children because it advises parents to ignore their children's cries. It advises women to breastfeed their infants no more than every 2 1/2 hours. However, when infants go through growth spurts which may occur at any time, they need to be fed more frequently."
1,This book is dangerous,"Ezzo has no qualifications whatsoever to write this book. He is an excommunicated evangelical minister with a thinly veiled hatred for children. Babies can't be spoiled; their wants are their needs. There is nothing natural about Babywise. Long term, this approach will create sleep problems, issues with trust, and behavioral difficulties down the road. Use Ezzo's approach at your child's risk."
5,Oustanding Book,Very Thorough easy to read book. Excellent resource for new parents who would like to be able to sleep and keep some semblance of order to their life.
1,It saddens me that this book is still available,"If you are considering following the advice in this book, one of the first things that you should know is that the original publisher, Multnomah, has returned all publishing rights to the author and will no longer be promoting the book because of the questionable advice it contains. Given that this book was probably a major money-maker for the publisher, that ought to be a clue that there are a lot of problems associated with this system of infant management. However, if you MUST implement it, make sure that you have the very latest edition of the book since the earlier editions are much more ""hard line"" than the later, and since Ezzo has softened his line SOMEWHAT since the book was first published."
1,An unrealistic book that panders to self-involved parents,"Please read the reviews for this book, and for Ezzo's other books. It is shocking that his books can rank in the top 300 of Amazon's sales. Many of the positive reviews stress that ""Discipline"" is required to make this system work. The same ""discipline"" can be applied to starve children of any age. Eventually they will grow inactive or listless enough that they will sleep for long stretches, too, to conserve energy from lack of food. I watched a couple I know apply this system and wonder aloud why two successive infants were screaming all the time, and in the next breath wonder why they were not gaining weight. One plunged from 80th percentile birthweight to NEGATIVE percentile weight. They were hungry! The parents were exactly the type of people I imagine wrote the glowing reviews. We don't need to get tough with two-week old infants."
1,"Babywise ""works"" but isn't wise mothering!","BW ""worked"" for me with my first 3 babies. I was able to teach them to sleep through the night and put them on a schedule. However, I lost my milk supply with my third, which is very common among BW moms. Ezzo treats this as normal by saying that you might be one of those moms who just doesn't produce enough milk. That is false - very few women don't produce enough. Ezzo would not know this - he has no medical training. He also claims to be a parenting expert, but his own children have nothing to do with him any more.My last 2 children were parented differently from my first 3. I became a more compassionate mother and did not deny what my own mother's heart told me was the right thing to do. They also slept through the night early and are well-adjusted children.Go to www.ezzo.info to read more about Gary Ezzo and his lack of qualifications to write a medical book."
1,didn't work for my baby,"I read this book while I was pregnant & thought ""great - my baby will sleep though the night at 3 months!"" Not so. This book does not follow a baby's or a mother's natural rhythms. It had a few helpful suggestions, but overall was very unrealistic. It suggests this system works for all babies. Well guess what, babies are people too, and all babies are different. Trying to force a baby to follow a certain routine just did not work for us. We had an extremely unhappy baby (and parents) for the first few months, until I started reading some other books. The book suggests having feeding time, then playtime then sleeptime. Sounds good, but baby would not cooperate. You can put a baby in a crib, but you can't force a baby to go to sleep. For a much better book, try Penelope Leach ""Your Baby & young Child"""
1,AAP Warns against this book! Stay far far away.,Do your research new moms and dads - there is a DIRECT LINK with infants who have failure to thrive and the Baby Wise schedule. The people who wrote this book have absolutely no business dealing with newborns.
5,Great book for new moms,"I loved this book. Being a new mom, I read it before my son was born. It's been great, I've referenced it lots since he was born and it really helps me to feel like I know what I'm doing a lot more than I would've. I'm definitely glad I read it. You take what you want from it and discard the rest. Although I personally haven't discarded much that this book says!"
3,Schedule good for baby and parents,"I am the father of 9-month-old twins born 9 weeks early. The preemie ward in the hospital fed them every 3 hours, and four weeks later when they came home they were on a great schedule. Using the advice given in this book, we continued this schedule and then, when we felt the babies were ready, cut out the 3 am feeding. By 14 weeks old they were sleeping 8 hours a nightI was quite surprised at the negative comments while reading some of the reviews. Nowhere does the book say to ignore or abuse your baby, nor does it say that the schedule had to be rigid.While I don't agree with everything that the book advises, the concept of getting the baby on a schedule is crucial for both the parents and the baby. . I can't imagine what it would be like to have twins that were not on a schedule"
1,Horrible: if you read this...,"do so only for shock value.New parents, I highly encourage you to hit your back arrow now and leave this page. Babies have DIED from their parents using the Ezzo system.I was given a copy of this book from my husband's well-meaning co-worker. The harshness of it astounded me. I'm supposed to let my infant lie alone in a playpen to ""think""? It's okay to smack the hands of a baby? The answer to both is no, it is not. A baby has no business just lying in any confined space unless the parent needs him there for safety reasons. Otherwise, she should have freedom to explore. Likewise, a study showed that babies whose hands are smacked are much less likely to explore their environments and learn.Those are just two small examples of the misinformation in this book; there are many others."
1,Hate it-Condoned child abuse,"If you want to read a book on how to be a neglectful and abusive parent, read this book. Not only has this guy's advice been linked to failure to thrive and emotional problems, but even the AAP warns parents about his material. If you get this book as a gift as I did, throw it in the trash."
1,What a horrible book!,"I am appalled with the notions in this book. This man has no business handing out ""parenting"" advice to anyone. All you need to know about this man is that he tried to correlate breastfeeding with the obesity epidemic in America. If that were true, then obesity would have been an epidemic since the dawn of time. To me, this assertion clearly defines his methods and assumptions as bonified quackery. Children are often inconvienient- if intimacy and effort are unappealing, raising a child is, in my opinion, not a compatible lifestyle choice."
1,This book is dangerous,"Newborns can be so inconvenient! Can you imagine coming into a place blind, unable to speak, unable to gesture, and ravenously hungry? All you can do is cry, and how dare you - the people God placed you with have a different schedule. Sorry, agenda. Tsk Tsk."
2,Not for the laid back parent..,"This book is way too strict in my opinion. It did help me get my son on a good eat-sleep-wake schedule early on but after he was 3 months old- it was way too rigid for us. I felt a 3 month old was way too young to cry-it-out at naps and at night.I highly recommend you try ""Healthy sleep habits, Happy child"" for a milder approach to cry-it-out and for a good nap schedule. That book is excellent.*Also after purchasing Baby Wise and doing more research, I found this man is not qualified to write a book on child care."
1,DANGEROUS AND INACCURATE,"gee, when the american assoc of pediatricians claims that this method can cause ""failure to thrive"" AND it goes against every maternal instinct ever created, AND the author basis his ""findings"" not from medical knowledge (he has no training) but HIS reading of the bible...All i say is READ ANYTHING ELSE!!"
2,Not worth the hype,This book is ok and has some good basis - however it is not for the mom who likes to leave her home or has other children that need to leave the home during the day.
2,The Good and The Bad,"The good point about this book: your baby can have a schedule and you don't have to be (entirely) at the mercy of your child. The big point of this book is baby should eat, play, then sleep every 2.5-3 hours. The bad: the tone. The author creates these scenarios where your life will be hell (up all night) if you use anything approaching attachment parenting techniques, and bliss if you use his. I'm no attachment parent, but it seemed a little simplistic.I tried using the Babywise schedule when my daughter was born, but she was just hungry. A lot. So I fed her, and things are fine. I found ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child"" more useful (though a bit too many nightmare scenarios of children and parents who are getting no sleep), and Happiest Baby on the Block. Although my favorite baby advice book is ""Caring for Your Baby and Young Child"" written by the American Academy of Pediatrics."
2,Nothing special.,"The book mainly talks about establishing a routine through what they call... Parent Direct Feeding. So using a schedule versus simply feeding on demand. Honestly, it's not even that helpful. Everyone already knows that children respond well to structure and routine such if you know what a routine is you don't need to read this book. The rest of the book it goes over the basics- how to breast & bottle feeding, burping, etc. I bought this book thinking it would be helpful, but it didn't tell me anything I already didn't know through common knowledge and common sense."
1,Terrible Parenting Advice,Babywise is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. It forces babies into unhealthy schedules which are not supported by current pediatric practices.
1,Credibility Questionable,"Be very CAUTIOUS about following the advice of this author. Too many people have taken what he says to the extreme and have ended up with babies who fail to thrive, as various studies show. To think of how many babies and families have been negatively affected by the opinions of this author is heartbreaking! Do the research for yourself about this author before you take to heart what he says. What are his credentials? What are his experiences? What are his intentions? What kind of person is he? Please don't blindly follow his instructions. Use discretion and your own intuition as a loving parent in deciding what is best for your baby."
1,baby lies,"Babies come into this world from a snug and comforting womb and need the affection , constant attention and love of their mother upon arrival to thrive. They need touch and comfort. This book is dangerous, the writers unqualified and I would encourage all to read Focus on the Families statement on the method at Ezzo.info The author, Ezzo, is estranged from his adult children and excommunicated over character issues. He wrongly expressed the Father's heart toward us, as John 14 says"" I wiill not leave you Comfortless.I will come to you!"" and again, ""I will send the Comforter and He will come to you."" God's heart was to comfort and is to comfort and He does not leave us to console ourselves. AT an older age, training can be done with a well adjusted, and secure infant, who is thriving! My grandchild is skin an bones and I am very concerned about him."
2,"OK, but there are MUCH better ones.","This book SEEMS great, if you are having your first baby. You'll think you have a plan, are ready, and have your handbook. Not so fast! This book could be dangerous, and the experts agree. It does have good advise about making the parents' relationship the center of the family (not the child) and about getting your baby on a schedule. However, it demands that you supress your instinct to go to your baby if he/she seems in pain or otherwise needs comfort. It goes as far as calling you weak if you go to comfort her. This is a bit drastic. If that baby needs you and you feel the need to go to her, you go! She could be scared or gassy, not just manipulative. We don't need this guy making us feel guilty for going in. My 2 kids have been sleeping through the night since 10-12 weeks old and still are at 3 and 1 year old. Get a book that helps you, not supresses your instincts. Pass on this one."
1,Not for Everyone,"We have followed this book's program for two weeks solid now and see none of the results it claims. It does not work.Signed, Bitter, sleepless parents"
1,"Nothing to do with God, love, happy babies or happy mums","Please don't follow the advice in this book. You can teach your baby to sleep through the night (once she is no longer hungry at night), to have a routine, and to learn what's right and wrong - simply by giving a lot of love and comfort. Your baby loves you, and loves predictability. There are 2 ways to teach her what to do, one by breaking her spirits from an early age (the Ezzo way) or by giving her confidence. Please choose the latter!I have a 1-year old baby who sleeps all night, is a great pleasure to be with, trusts me and the people around her, is thriving and full of life. Equally, we as her parents are happy. Please don't think you have to go through the Ezzo routine to achieve this."
1,Babywise hurts children,"I have a friend who used this book believing it was God's best for her child, and her child was literally starving to death and nearly died. This is a worst case scenario, but it did happen.You should also know that The American Academy of Pediatrics has linked this book to infant dehydration and a failure to thrive (FFT). Read for yourself here: http://aapnews.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/21Please research other child rearing methods like Attachment Parenting before trying this one."
1,Not For New Mothers,"As a new mom, I purchased this book thinking it would help me learn how to get my infant to sleep longer at night. Reading this book made me feel like a failure as a mother for not having my 7wk old on a rigid three hour schedule of feedings and napping. Ezzo ""talks down"" to mothers and has an attitude of ""this is simple, what's your problem"", leaving no room for the differences babies have right from the beginning. If you'd like a helpful book on sleeping, read the Weisbluth book which has parent's personal stories as well as scientific data and research. Please do not buy this book for a new mom."
1,"Read it if you must, but talk to your doc before using.","I have read this book, cover to cover.I have also consulted with the American Academy of Pediatrics.I have also looked through scientific journals to find support for the statements Gary Ezzo makes in this book.I have read nearly every document on www.ezzo.info, both in the PRO and the CON section.Thus, I will not use the Baby Wise method with my child. I hope that you will think carefully about where you place your trust when deciding on feeding/sleeping/scheduling methods for your precious baby. For me, I am only swayed by solid scientific evidence. I am not swayed by eloquent but baseless prose.I am disappointed that Amazon will consistently display the 5-star rating for this book (in order to boost sales, I'd imagine) above the more numerous 1-star ratings that follow. Shame, shame."
1,"Caution, young parents","When applied to the extreme, this method could be considered child neglect. I find it irresponsible to leave a fully awake, curious, and happy baby alone to cry it out.In my own family, I find my ""ezzo-trained"" grandchildren to be less verbal and slower to develop than those who were simply loved, enjoyed, and accepted.Parenting is hard, and sometimes requires parental sacrifice. Meeting your baby's needs now, will create a trusting reliance on you as the parent, that will bless your relationship always."
5,It really does work!,"My first child is now four months old and has been sleeping through the night since she was seven weeks. I used this book to learn about how to feed her to get her to sleep through the night when she was first born and now I am using it to learn how to introduce solid foods. It is easy to read and understand. In fact, I have certain pages marked to refer back to from time to time. My baby is happy, well rested, and growing like a weed. This strategy is wonderful for parents who would like to be well rested and be able to appreciate their happy, growing baby during the day!"
1,The best thing about this book....,"is the satisfying smack it makes when it hits a wall, having been thrown across the room by a frustrated new mother. The advice in this book is unrealistic, bordering on cruel. It sets parents up for more frustration and disappointment with themselves through it's promises of blissful parental joy. This book is not compatable with breastfeeding, though it claims otherwise, and is dangerous to the natural parent-child relationship. Perhaps it is useful for killing mosquitoes; I can't think of much other purpose for it."
1,How to be selfish and raise a distrustful child,"Babies are for loving, not training like military recruits! This book makes it ""convenient"" for the parent and hell for the child. How would you like to be denied food and water just because it wasn't ""time"" to eat yet?I don't believe any parent with empathy and true love for their baby could follow the guideline in this very scary book!Children learn love and trust though the way they are parented. Forcing them as infants to go without food and drink, to be abandoned, alone in their rooms without comfort, to be ignored and abused, that is what this book teaches.There are a number of lawsuits against Ezzo for children that have dehydrated and failed to grow properly because their parents followed this frightening agenda.A caring loving relationship with your baby cannot exist along with the ideas in this book."
2,Be led by the Shepherd!,"I have not read ""Babywise"", but read ""Preparation for Parenting"" (""Babywise"" is its secular counterpart). I have NO problem with scheduling (as long as babies are not being harmed, of course). My issue is the way scheduling is presented in these books as if it is THE way to be a ""good"" (or as in the case of PFP, a ""godly"") mother. I wrote a blog addressing my concerns of legalism within the church. On there, I reviewed two of the Ezzo's parenting manuals because I believe they introduce legalistic teachings into Christian circles. My heart is to encourage young moms to be ""gently led"" by the Shepherd when making decisions like how to care for their infants. You can link to my blog here:[...]Sisters, please remember that it is ""for freedom Christ has set us free!""All for Jesus,Laura"
1,A Very Dangerous Book,"Please, for you child's sake, research Gary Ezzo before purchasing this book and putting his methods into practice in your home (babycenter.com is a good place to start).The World Health Organization and American Academy of Pediatrics have both denounced the methods of scheduling babies in the book as they can lead to failure to thrive among other problems.Just because a method for scheduled feedings, ""sleep training"", etc. ""WORKS"" does not mean it is best for your baby's physical and emotional health. When your baby cries he/she needs you...period."
1,Scary and dangerous,"The ideas in this book were scary! I am so glad that after reading this book I read others and researched more! Numerous researchers have shown that the guidelines set in this book concerning feeding guidelines are not only inhumane but can be dangerous. Many ""failure to thrive"" cases have been linked to the feeding schedules outlined in this book. Many of the other premises set forth in this book also are potentially as dangerous. Before taking the information in this book as ""gospel"", research all sources and check with your pediatrition."
1,"No, No, No! Ezzo is Evil!","The American Academy of Pediatrics, La Leche League, and countless other respected entities have come out against Gary Ezzo and his ""babywise"" method. According to the AAP, the infant feeding program outlined in Babywise has been ""associated with failure to thrive (FTT), poor weight gain, dehydration, breast milk supply failure, and involuntary early weaning."" Ezzo has NO medical credentials. Zero, zip, nada. His advice is medically unsound and dangerous and should not be followed!!"
1,BAD for babies,"First, the AAP does not recommend sleep training until 12 weeks and this is, in part, because newborn babies do not have the brain development necessary to ""learn"" to sleep before then and they also need to eat when they are hungry to get to their optimal weight.Second, if you do not nurse on demand for at least the first 2 months, your body will not produce the amount of milk your baby needs because you are artificially cutting off your baby's natural instinct to nurse to increase your milk production.This guy is a fundamentalist religious nut as well. I read his book because a former co-worker gave it to me and I got a funny feeling that something was off about this guy. I did some research on him and realized my concerns were justified. I am so glad I did not follow his recommendations."
1,RUN!!!,"in the description, it says this book is "" authorative""? Well, Ezzo is NOT a pediatrician. He has ZERO medical experience with children. He is a minister, NOT a pediatrician! Babies have been admitted to the hospital for dehydration due to Ezzo's schedule feeding. children have been removed from their homes because good,christian parents have read and adopted the practices from Babywise. Don't take my word for it-research Ezzo for yourself, and find out what he really is..."
1,Not for parents who care!,"This book was recommended to me by a pregnant friend while I was pregnant with my second child. With memories of sleepless nights and hectic, unpredicatable days from my first, I was open-minded and interested based upon my friend's description of the book. As I read this book, a sick, sinking feeling grew inside my heart. How could anybody a treat a infant this way? This book should be called ""parent-centered"" or ""parent convenience training."" I got through the first book and was appalled. I had purchased the follow-up book at the same time I bought this one, so I opened it to even worse advice and horrible recommended treatment of children (like, if your toddler is not potty-trained by 18 mos. they should be required to clean themselves up if they soil themselves! ). This guy is nuts and as far as these people that inflict this treatment on their children: ""never underestimate the power of denial."""
1,"Babywise leads to dehydration, failure to thrive","WARNING! Babywise has been linked to dehydration and failure to thrive in infants. See [...] from the American Academy of Pediatrics.Note that the author, Gary Ezzo, is NOT a pediatrician and has NO medical training. His advice is in direct contradiction with principles of healthy baby feeding and sleeping practices.Regardless of your parenting philosophy, Babywise gives dangerous advice."
1,I do not like this book,"This book will tell you to ignore the advice given in every other baby book. It ignores a mothers opinions and tells you to ignore your instincts. There are so many other, better baby books out there. Skip this one."
1,Not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics,This book deviates from the practices that are recommended by the AAP. The use of these methods can result in requiring medical intervention for your child. I will not utilize this book or any method not backed by sound science and backed by the medical community at large. Parents beware.
1,Ridiculous!,"After I finished reading this horrid thing, I recycled it. I didn't want to donate it or sell it to a used book store on the off chance that somebody might mistake it for actual parenting advice. Do not buy this, do not check it out at the library. It is more useless than the advice childless strangers seem compelled to give parents."
1,This book should be banned from the shelves,"This is a very irresponsible and dangerous book that instructs parents to train their babies like lab rats. The book has been linked to failure to thrive (in middle class babies, too) for thousands of infants. Please, please, please do some research of your own before following the tenets of this book. It also instructs you to let your baby cry for two hours or more, a direct contradiction to AAP and WHO recommended practices. A good book to read is Attachment parenting by Katie Granjou and The Baby Book by William Sears. Don't fall victim to this book!"
1,Please don't buy this book! Your child will thank you.,"The ideas in this book will seem tempting because they make nighttime parenting seem free of responsibilities. The truth is that your children need you whenever they need you, and to try to ""train"" them NOT to need you for eight hours each night is highly detrimental to their short- and long-term development. Studies have shown that letting babies and children ""cry it out"" leads quickly to loss of trust in the parents; anger; a feeling of betrayal; decreased neurological development and function due to the stress of separation. Infants are programmed to need their parents. Please don't deny yourself and your child this wonderful bond by treating them with the insensitivity and callousness that this book promotes.Buy Dr. Sears ""Nighttime Parenting"" book instead! or Dr. Jay Gordon's ""Good Nights"""
1,Not a wise choice,"Common sense should hopefully prevail over this very unwise book. Google ""babywise"" and you will find volumes of text criticizing this method. Criticisms written by actual professionals who know better."
2,good concepts but kind of all over the place,"A few good ideas but the Baby Whisperer has the same basic concept and her book is much easier to follow. I started on these concepts and within a week, my baby was sleeping through the night."
1,It never arrived!!!,I ordered it and it never arrived!! I waited over a month for it and it never came. I had to call and get a refund. I can't believe I waited that long for nothing! At least they gave me the refund right away.
1,Research Ezzo before you buy,"My husband purchased this book after it was recommended by a friend's friend. I had an uneasy feeling about this method after just reading the first chapter (check the Excerpt on Amazon).I wish I had researched Ezzo's method on the Web before wasting my money on this book. There are a lot of highly qualified sources that discredit BabyWise methods. I skimmed through the rest of the book (for curiosty) and did somethind I've never done with a book: put it in the trash can.Carefully research before you buy. The Babywise method may be ""convenient"" for parents, but is it good for babies?BTW. Getting my baby to sleep through the night was never high on my priority list, but my 12 week old now sleeps 8+ hours. What is #1 in my priority list? A healthy baby, something that is hard to get using Ezzo's methods."
1,Dangerous Stuff,"Ezzo's *own publisher* called the book dangerous in march, 2001 and had plans to cancel publication. The American Association of Pediatrics has made formal statements against this type of parenting. None of his studies are scientific. In fact the APA has cited his feeding directives as dangerous. Also, he supports the idea of corporal punishment for children under two. Again, the APA has indicated this is *highly inappropriate*. I question the lack of responasbility Amazon shows in offering a book that harms babies."
5,Very useful information on your baby's first year!,"Keep in mind that when you look for advice, take it with a grain of salt for heaven's sake!!! The book is not the know- all -end all, however it is extremely insightful in providing ideas and methods that can be extremely helpful when you have a new baby. The idea, as in with anything you read, is to use what makes sense to you and works with your baby. The basic principal of Mr. Ezzo's approach absolutely does work. I used it on my first baby and on my twins!!! Read it, try it, and conform it to your baby. Anyone who criticizes this author should go back and read the book again. Mr. Ezzo clearly defines that everyone's experience is different."
3,common sense,book has a lot of good ideas..however i found most of the patterns it dictates my son did naturally while i was still reading. Read it for extra support but don't take it too seriously babies are all different and tend to make there own schedules.
1,"Cruel, ""training"" of infants","I don't know how people can think that making their 8 week old baby ""wail"" to be comforted is something to be proud of. We're talking about babies here, not some thing to control and make fit into your comfortable life. Listen to your hearts as parents, not some crackpot's book. Tend to your children, let them build trust in you that you'll be there for them. A routine is important but a militant schedule is not. Please don't buy this book. Your children will thank you."
2,Against my instincts...,"After reviewing this book... I decided not to use the methods. Everything I have learned when studying the psychological development of our little ones in addition to my own mothering instincts tell me that responding to my child when she is expressing her needs builds trust, security and ultimately independence/ self-confidence for my child. I have a close friend who uses the Babywise methods and is content with them, however I do not feel it is for me. I encourage mothers to read about several different approaches before making a decision. I believe that if you do, one of the approaches will not only make sense to you, but will FEEL right to you as well. For me, Babywise is not that approach."
4,good reference,"This book covers lots of questions one may have about getting baby to sleep through the night. It's also easy to read, which is nice for us moms who have new babies and not a whole lot of free time..."
2,not for children who were adopted (Please!),"we used this book faithfully during the first year+ for our 4 month old adopted son. (also toddler wise and child wise) He is now almost four and we are having serious attachment issues. I know there are many good areas of this book, specifically keeping kids on a schedule, but please read and use attachment books and therapy with your adopted children (exclusively or in addition to this book). Believe me, you don't want to experience what we are going through right now."
4,Useful,"The authors advocate ""Parent-Directed Feeding"", with the ultimate goal of having an infant learn how to sleep though the night by eight weeks. The idea is very simple - parents should structure the life (i.e. feeding and sleeping) of the infant around their lives, instead of vice-versa. This is done by feeding the baby a full meal approximately every three hours, instead of ""snack-feeding"" whenever a baby cries (""demand-based feeding""). Accordingly, this leads to psychologically healthier children who are more independent and aware of the needs of others. I'm aware of the controversy which surrounds the rigidity of the feeding structure proposed by the authors; however for me, what the authors say seem to make a lot of common sense. Right now we're doing a loose version of PDF with our son (grandparents aren't too crazy about letting a baby wail for over two minutes) - we'll see how the results pan out."
5,It Works!,"On Becoming Baby Wise had a fabulous positive impact on our whole experience of having a little one. As first time parents, it gave us the confidence to make parenting decisions without doubting ourselves. Parental Directed Feeding is a concept that is in line with our own philosophies on parenting. Our little one is a good eater, sleeper (slept through the night within 10 weeks), and generally well adjusted. I have recommended this book to anyone who is interested in listening. I hope you feel the same way after reading it."
4,An awesome Routine For You and Your Baby ! ! !,What can we say other than we are extremely thankful to our friends for sharing this book with us. We have a very happy and content little girl who is still only 3 months and so far we are really happy with the results from Babywise. She has always slept a min of 6 hours through the night from birth and then from 7-8 weeks on she sleeps 9-10 hours through the night. She is continuing to put on weight well and we are only too happy to share with anyone about this book. Routine does not hurt a baby at all but shows how much you love them and want them to fit into your lifestyle.We thank God for these gifted men who have given many people a guideline for success in parenting.
4,A Wonderful GUIDELINE for parents,A family member gave Babywise to me when I gave birth to my first baby and I don't know what I would have done without it. The book offers wonder ful SUGGESTIONS for raising a happy and INDEPENDENT child. I read the book cover to cover and used the principles in the book that I agreed with. Both of my children slept through the night by eight weeks. As a parent you are the ultimate decision maker for your child. This book encourages you to do what you are comfortable with while following their principles and leaves room for YOUR judgement as a parent. You can tailor your childs schedule to your and your childs needs. This book is for parents who are not willing to let their child run their life and realize that children are happier with routine and boundaries!!!! This book can help you help your kids to become happy and independent individuals.
5,"BEST FOR THE PARENT, CHILD, AND FAMILY!","This book stands on it's own, setting the standard for training your child in his or her own best interests right from birth. If you read with a closed mind or with presuppositions, you may get the idea that parents who use these methods are self-centered. On the contrary, any parent who wants to show their child how much they love them can find a means to do so in this book. Using the book doesn't mean it will be easy, but it will be better. Most of all, keep in mind to be flexible."
3,"It works; however, I do not agree with everything it says...","Being a first-time mom, a friend recommend this book before our son was born. I read it and was quite offended by some of its suggestions. I decided to just take the parts that I liked and apply them and go with my instincts for the rest. My son was sleeping through the night at 7 weeks and takes his naps very well. He is not in the least bit under nourished even though he was 4 weeks early. I cuddle my little guy all the time and have a great bond with him that I think the book does not promote. We would let him cry, but we never let him scream himself to sleep as it suggests. Parents need to go with their instincts on some things and that is just what we did. It would have driven me crazy to follow this book by the letter. I'm glad we used the parts we needed a basically skipped the rest."
3,"A book worth reading, own judgment needed","Although there were some things I didn't agree with in the book, for the most part, it was just common sense that really helped me understand my baby better! And with understanding comes confidence. This book is about how to tune into your baby's needs. If you feel that feeding your baby every time it cries is the way to go, don't bother reading this book. For all others, my advice is to read the book and use what information you find useful. Just leave the information you don't agree with behind! That's what I did and it is working wonderfully for me."
4,"Parent Directed Feeding, not clock feeding","I think a common misconception of this book is that Ezzo is recommending rigid clock-feeding, which he DOES NOT advocate.Ezzo's feeding concept in this book is ""Parent Directed Feeding"", which uses both the baby's hunger cues and parental judgment to direct a feeding schedule. It's not about feeding the baby in 2-3 hour intervals, it's about setting a consitent pattern of wake/feeding/sleep times to work with your child's natural clock.I'd recommend this book to anyone, but take from it what you will and leave what you don't want. I do not believe anyone's book should be seen as the end-all authority on anything. Just take everything with a grain of salt and use your better judgement.Apart from the feeding issue, one thing I did greatly enjoy about this book was the first chapter in which Ezzo stresses the importance of maintaining a healthy husband-wife relationship. I think that first chapter is definitely worth a peek."
3,"I thought it was a bit extreme, but some of it can work","I was reluctant to read this, but once I started I found some of the areas to be very interesting. Unfortunately, you will find it goes against what most hospitals say, but some of it makes sense! You know your child best, so take some of this book with a grain of salt. I didn't follow it perfectly. Read and add a little tender loving care and I think some of the guidance could work."
5,Thanks!,"People can't stop commenting on what a happy and contented baby we have. This was not the case at about 3 months old. Almost the day we switched to this method of feeding, napping etc. did my baby stop crying. I have many friends who have used the Ezzo's approach and you can sure tell when we get together with the non-Ezzo babies...they are almost always cranky, tired and unhappy. To those critics out there...Phooey! Babies develop their own schedules anyway, even if parents claim that they are demand fed."
4,A good set of guidelines for a different approach.,"As a first-time parent who was told repeatedly that demand-feeding was the only loving option, I reluctantly read this book in desperation. This is the first (and only) book that I read that provided some basic guidelines and suggestions for scheduled feeding. It was a welcome voice in the dark and helped me get started on the road back from sleep deprivation. As with all parenting advice, it should be adjusted to suit your and your child's own needs. The authors promise a great deal, and parents should not be disappointed if they do not achieve miracles. However, this is an extremely helpful book for parents and children who do not thrive on demand feeding."
1,Abusive Right-wing,"See the Salon.com article on this book. It exposes the fact that the author, a rabidly right-wing fundamentalist"
1,"Studies show that babies who are ""Babywise"" cry 70% more....","than babies who are held and fed and tended to by cue. I think the ultimate test should be how does it make you feel? I read the book and I even tried it, I let my poor baby cry because I thought it would be best for her in the long run. Now I know I was wrong. There is NO proof that babies will sleep longer with this method, and there are lots of scientific documentation that it is dangerous.The bottom line is babies aren't convienent. They are loud and messy and don't sleep much, but we all knew that going in. Babies don't understand why you won't help them when they cry, they can't read a clock or tell it is time for bed. All they understand is that they are hungry and you won't feed them or that they are scared and lonely and you have left them to cry.Please learn about babies, they don't know how to be bad or spoiled or manipultive, they are just being babies. Be a good parent, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!"
1,Frightening book,"I totally agree with the nurse and the others who were disturbed by this book. I too am a nurse, with several years of pediatric experience. I currently work in a program that helps first-time-mothers learn parenting skills, which includes bonding with and ""listening to"" their babies. This book completely goes against everything we have learned, and everything we teach. If you read this book, please keep an open mind! Remember, newborns cannot go for long periods without eating. Their blood sugar can drop, and they may become unable to awaken. Please use caution!"
3,You know what's best for your child!,"My husband & I read Babywise from cover to cover while I was pregnant. When my daughter was first born we were struggling with breastfeeding, so we were alternating between breast milk and formula. This made it very difficult to follow the structured schedule that Babywise suggests. When we went to formula exclusively, we did start her on a schedule and though she did not immediately ""sleep through the night,"" it did regulate her feeding times. After a few months, it became too exhausting to keep up with the ""schedule,"" so we stopped. Now, after 3 months, our baby is finally sleeping through the night (9 hours!) on her own! Babywise had some great concepts and I do believe that structured schedules can be very healthy for a baby, but each baby is different and you must do what is best for YOUR baby! I don't knock Babywise, there are several parents that this has worked wonders for!"
1,Scary!,"I'm frightened at the thought that this book continues to be on bestseller lists. I received this book for a baby shower and was at first thrilled by the prospect of getting our baby to sleep through the night. It made some sense, and I thought I would apply the principles in a loose way -- discounting the theory that newborns need time alone, for example. In short, the methods made me miserable, made my baby hungry (she took 3 weeks to regain birth weight) and eventually led to the demise of my milk supply. I also understand that the Ezzos include spanking from the age of as early as 5 months as part of their theory. All in all, I think this method teaches parents to distance themselves from their children and ignore their own instincts. Try The Baby Book by William Sears instead."
1,FAILURE TO THRIVE,"Please please please do not use this on your children. I want to cry every time I see think about this book. My nephew was classified as ""Failure to Thrive"" after his parents followed the rules listed in this book. Look, if you're searching for a parenting material, DON'T RISK IT ON A BOOK THAT HAS THIS MANY 1 STAR REVIEWS. If you're not convinced, just research it. There will be a lot of professionals warning you of the dangers of this book (warnings about breastfeeding, milk production, long term effects, etc). I know there are a lot of 5 star ratings, but there's almost 1,000 1 star reviews. They aren't ""haters"" as some people say, they are heartfelt people genuinely concerned and deeply saddened. Bottom line, it's not worth the risk to your child to figure out if this book will or will not work."
5,"Great book, hard to deny the evidence.","So obviously the book is really controversial, and pretty much people either love it or hate it. Everyone I've known personally who attempted to put the concepts in the book into practice ALL had a baby sleeping through the night by 2 1/2 months.I'd recommend checking pretty much any of the babycenter mom's boards and take a look at the people who are having problems even into two years after their child was born. You'll notice that 100% of those people are the strongest against the baby wise method. I think all kids are different and obviously we have to be open to addressing their needs. But instead of reading reviews and discussing strategy, go take a look at some of the baby boards and scan back a few years and see which parents are still having major sleep struggles with their kids the longest. It's not even close, Baby Wise parents win hands down, and that's the best evidence to me of what really works."
5,Really works!!!,My brother lent me this book and since I'm not a book person I didn't read it until I felt exhausted and desperated for the lack of sleep when my baby was borned.I started to apply the concepts and within the first week the baby was able to sleep from 11:30pm to 6am even though she was having a severe reflux problem. She was 8 weeks old and it was a great relief to me because I was already back to work.
1,Dangerous,"Over 12 years as a pediatrician I have seen many babies harmed by this assinine book. Poor weight gain, crying constantly, insecure and neglected. The babies that have done well with these techniques are babies that would have done well no matter what. For babies that need more food or nurturing.... this is pure child neglect and abuse. Do NOT follow it. Listen to your pediatrician and not a religious freak with no medical training."
1,Completely against instinct,"This book depicts how to create a baby that is convenient for the parents, not how to raise and comfort a baby based on his/her needs. I was sad reading parts of this book, it goes completely againts maternal instinct. There is no way to spoil a baby with love... Society has made the schedules, not babies, their needs are not clockwork, their cries are their tool to communicate and letting a baby cry is horrible."
1,Babyfoolish.,"you know, i read the Bible, nowhere did it say ""and then God created schedules, and parent directed feeding, and crying it out.. and it was Good."" nope, nowhere.. so i dont think it is God at all who is directing this book.. just a nutcase named Ezzo. Jesus made it to adulthood breastfed.. so im even more sure that he wasnt babywised. Nope, no failure to thrive or anything... I am quite sure that Mary never told Jesus He wasnt hungry... nope. Moving on."
5,Truly the GIFT of nighttime sleep,"We had several friends recommend this book for training your baby to sleep through the night. We were skeptical and didn't want to ""schedule"" our baby's feedings; however, it isn't like that at all. It is more a question of giving your baby a FULL feeding whenever he/she is hungry during the first ten days (then they automatically fall into a 2 1/2-hour to 3-hour routine), and after that, it is a matter of making sure they eat, have some wake time, then sleep, in that order. Every baby is different, but our daughter was sleeping 7 hours a night by seven weeks old, and by the time she was 12 weeks, she was sleeping 10 hours a night consistently. We have friends whose baby was sleeping 7-8 hours a night at 5 weeks old. Getting a full nights' sleep earlier, rather than later (like when your child doubles his/her birth weight) is PRICELESS!"
1,Regret buying without reading more about it,"I'm totally against the methods used in this book. I wish I had done some research before buying it instead of blinding following someone's recommendation. Parents, please use your instincts rather than books that make parenting easy instead of right."
5,NOT A DANGER TO INFANTS/In-Home Daycare,"I read all the reviews and then read the book. The people that claim this is a danger to your infants are wrong. In the back of the book there is a eating log. What happens is people scan over the book and don't sit and read it and then take bits and pieces. The program will not work unless you do everything. I have used this program plus the Baby whisperer and The Happiest Baby On the Block books and dvds, and I have happy infants and moms. Don't scan these books and take a little bit you must READ IT ALL before you can apply any of the concepts."
3,"It's a restaurant review, not a recipe","Editing my review after second kid.First kid, as I'm sure for all new parents with ""first-world"" problems,* we read some books including this one, listened to all sorts advice, did all sorts of stuff. After about 6 months, the kid slept about 8 hours a night. Growing up, doing well in school and athletics... basically no scars from whatever we did.Second kid, did whatever felt right at the time, no plan, just let it roll. After about 6 months, kid slept about 8 hours a night. Growing up, doing well... no scars.Bottom line is, humans have been rearing babies for about a million years, mammals over 60 million. It's doubtful that you or a book is going to re-invent the wheel.* by first world problems I mean, ask someone who was born in the third world if parents are reading how to raise babies books, or are worried about peanut allergies or spectrum disorder or worry about feeding chicken bones to their dogs."
3,Good Book if used with common sense,"After reading this book I do not see what the controversy is really about. It's only a rigid system if YOU make it one. Tailor it to work for you, just like you do with EVERY bit of advice we parents get.The only thing I disagree with in this book is starting it so early. I didn't read it till my baby was 2 months old and I think that's about the right age to start this system. I feel that trying to start a routine any earlier is just not needed or good.In short I'd recommend it to parents who have a 2 month or older baby and would like to get a little more sleep at night."
1,do I have to give it stars?,"I picked this book up at my sister-in-laws house and it scared the bejesus out of me. As an early childhood professional (MEd), the idea of leaving a baby alone who is crying is absolutely horrible. People are social animals....babies especially so. Remember that babies don't understand that if they don't see mommy, she will come back. If she's not there, she's gone for good, as far as they are concerned. Babies are not machines who need their diapers changed and a boob stuck in their mouths regularly. They need contact. With parents. If you aren't ready to let a child take over you life, maybe you shouldn't have one. An infant is at your mercy totally - that's why we have mothering insticts. You're supposed to be tired...remember, no one said this was going to be easy or CONVENIENT."
1,Another negative review,"There are already enough negative reviews of this book, but I thought it was so inappropriate and frankly the worst book I have ever read about child rearing that I had to speak up. The advice is presented in an unscientific, prejudiced, controlling way. There are plenty of books that are based on what is known about child development with helpful information for parents.I would even go so far as to say the advice in this book is abusive."
1,"There is nothing ""Christian"" about this book","There is nothing ""Christian"" about this type of child rearing, except that throughout history individuals have used their religious beliefs to justify abusing their children. (an excellent book entitled SPARE THE CHILD by Phillip Greven documents the theological origins of abusive child rearing practices in early American Christianity, but this behavior is by no means limited to Christians.)I say this as a devout Christian, who in her baptismal vows agreed to ""respect the dignity of every human being"". I won't get into the medical issues, although the tenets of this book go against everything I know as a breastfeeding mother. Remember--infanticide was practiced as a form of birth control in Jesus' day, but Jesus said that we must become as little children to enter the Kingdom of Heaven."
4,This book is very helpful for first time parents.,This book is extremely helpful for first time parents that are looking for ways to help organize their life with a new little one. In the first two weeks of my daughter's life I found myself many times referring to the book for help and advice. This book gave me more confidence about parenting and helped me feel more secure about the decisions I was making as a parent.
1,Complete waste of money,"Don't waste your money.If you want to read a good parenting book, try anything by Dr.Sears."
1,The AAP has issued a Media Alert against this book,"The practices in this book can be dangerous to you baby's health. If the American Academy of Pediatrics has an opinion on the possible consequences of a book on a baby's health, I listen! Please read the article at Babycenter before purchasing this book. I purchased and read the book. I was uncomfortable with some of the author's suggestions and decided it wasn't my parenting style. I later came across the Babycenter article and threw the book away. There are lots of other effective, more compassionate techniques for helping your baby sleep. I followed T. Berry Brazelton's advice for establishing a healthy sleep cycle for my infant with excellent results."
5,Met my expectations,I was delighted with the condition of the book and how it arrived in a timely manner. I have nothing negative to say!
1,Dangerous Nonsense,"I hope anyone thinking of buying this book will do someresearch first. The American Academy of Pediatrics, among many others,has come out with serious warnings about this so-called method...For those whose orientation to this method is religious, Christian pediatrician Dr. William Sears has also issued a strong warning...Please, please, please reconsider adopting this dangerous plan."
1,Don't follow this book to a science,"There are some ideas you can run with in this book but BEWARE. Infants should be fed on demand, not the scheduled feedings that this book recommends (especially if breastfeeding!) Also, this book recommends letting your baby cry it out to go to sleep before they are developmentally capable of self-soothing which naturally happens around 4-6 months of age (just an estimate of age range.) Take my review for what you will, but I highly DO NOT recommend using this book to get your child on a schedule. Instead I recommend the book Baby 411 - written by a medical doctor and gives you a VARIETY of ways to get your baby to sleep that is developmentally appropriate. Baby 411 is all about your baby from birth to 1 year of age, from feeding to just about every problem under the sun - it is extremely helpful. One more thing, Babywise is not in line with recommendations by The American Academy of Pediatrics."
1,Research,"I believe all of us have had this book recommended to us...and we all wish our babies would sleep...but what the author didn't know when he wrote it...is that the reason they sleep is really bad. It's a psychological condition known as, ""Learned Helplessness."" (...)It's worth looking into this a little. I wish someone had told me before I gave it a shot because the 2 kids (of my 8) which I used these techniques with still have notable ""issues"" with trust, social situations and communication.I've only recently found out that the author has a shady history. No college education. Was excommunicated from his church. And...his own grown children have disowned him.Check out: ""The Science of Parenting"" or ""Attached at the Heart""...great scientifically based books which will help you understand and really enjoy your baby. :)The Science of ParentingAttached at the Heart: 8 Proven Parenting Principles for Raising Connected and Compassionate Children"
4,Could not have done it without this book!!!,"We have followed this books methods very closely and our son who is now 5 and 1/2 weeks old has been sleep through the night for the last 11 days from 10:30 pm until 6:00 am!!!! (We are formula feeding exclusively -so for breas-fed babies, they usually can't go as long of a time).I highly recomend this book to anyone craves structure and routine and needs their baby to fit in with their lives as easily as possible."
3,I took what I needed out of the book,"I read this book during my pregnancy to determine how I wanted to raise my baby. There was a ton of useful bits and pieces in the book; however, I believe that the whole theory behind baby wise is a little much. Get this book if you are all about schedules (which I'm not). And if your not, read it with an open mind and I promise you'll learn a tng or two."
4,good book,Good read for first time Moms about what foods to eat. As advertised. Four out of five stars. Would recommend
1,Failure to Thrive,"This style of parenting has been warned against by the AAP and puts children at risk for failure to thrive, ppor weight gain and dehydration. Ezzo has zero qualifications to tell others how to raise children. Do a search on babywise and you will see that he claims many medical facts which are simply false."
1,The Facts are Simple,"Can you give zero stars, this book should recalled because it threatens the lives of children. I am not going to go on and on because it is really very simple. These methods have been associated babies DYING, is that the parenting book you were looking for. I have read this and it terrifies me, I feel sick to my stomach thinking about this. Please try The Baby Book by Sears."
1,"Horrible, misguided book","Please google the author and look at his qualifications. He is not a doctor and has no training. It's horrible that this book has been adopted by the fundamentalist Christian society as a way to raise babies. Babies should nurse/feed on demand. Babies SHOULD NOT be put on a schedule this early in life. Crying it out has negative consequences and you are ignoring your babies needs. I could go on and on. The point is the book gives HORRIBLE, DANGEROUS advice. I never throw away books but threw away this one -- didn't want anyone else exposed to this frightening drivel."
1,Learned Helplessness,"I have four kids that all sleep awesome without anxiety or night lights. All of them as babies were held when they cried, nursed to sleep, rocked, and cuddled. They all grew up to fast to let them scream for hours in their bed just because this book said so. Take the time to love your babies, you'll never regret it."
1,"Book is based in the authors opinion, not science","After having four children I finally read Baby Wise just to see what all the hype is about. I found the author irritating as he stated his opinions as fact. Of course his methods work, but at what cost? I found the No-cry sleep solution much more well balanced. The author, Elizabeth Pantley has an obvious bias toward co-sleeping but recognizes her way is not the only way and offers many solutions for getting baby to sleep through the night. (Unlike Gary Ezzo.) Pantley offers solutions for all different parenting types. I am not a big milk producer, had I followed Ezzo's feeding advice all of my babies would have suffered from starvation. I do not see balance in Ezzo's words. I see only opinion."
4,I wish I had this book while I was pregnant,"I thought this book was very good. It helped us to get our baby on a schedual and therefore made our lives slightly more sane. Our daughter is 10 weeks old and slept throught the night when she was 5 weeks old. I use this book and the book ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer"" as references. Both have the same ideas as far as getting them on a schedual. ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer"" says to go to the baby whenever she cries. ""On Becoming Babywise"" says to let them cry it out. I think there needs to be a happy medium between the two. That is why I say I use them both. Both agree that the baby should feed, play and then sleep. Neither tells what you are supposed to do if the baby falls asleep after a feed and you cannot get her to wake up."
1,A fundamentalist Christian approach...,"that twists scripture and that doesn't work!! Well, it might work depending on what your goal is. But to raise a healthy, happy, loving, confident child I would base on actual biblical teachings not Ezzo's version! I know well intentioned moms who used this method and underfed their child. I know many mothers who used this method and heard the same story over and over - ""I tried to breastfeed but by x months my milk dried up/wasn't enough/didn't keep up with the babies needs"". This book is off track biblically, medically and psychologically and is dangerous. We read and researched and glad we answered our babies needs and followed God's original designs. By the way, some readers might be confused as Baby Wise doesn't mention scripture etc, but it is just the secular version to ""Raising Kids God's Way""."
1,This philosophy works - ever been to an orphanage?,"The babies there don't cry, either. Leaving a newborn baby to cry because (as the book says) ""Mama decides when naptime begins; Mama decides when naptime ends."" will certainly train the child not to bother you with their crying.Do a search an decide if you are so desperate to believe the lofty promises in this book that you don't mind if your child will have Reactive Attachment Disorder, failure to thrive or infant depression."
1,How to Break Your Baby's Heart and Lose His Trust,"I'd rather not give this book any stars at all. Babies do not manipulate, babies have needs that do not mesh with the adult clock. They are designed to eat often and their breathing and heartbeat are regulated by their mothers', hence their need for near constant touch. I read this book and tortured my child for a week before I came to my senses, threw the book in the dumpster where it belongs and followed my instincts in caring for my son. He is neither whiny, nor clingy, he has confidence in me and my husband and I have confidence in our parenting skills because we respond to his cues. Don't waste your money"
1,This is a dangerous book.,"I had heard the hullabaloo about this book, and decided to give it a read. I was shocked! I never thought it would be as bad as it really is. Cold, and cruel, and dangerous. I answer breastfeeding help calls from people who are doing Babywise, and their children are DYING. I am serious. I have gotten serveral calls from people whose babies were not waking up, because they were starving to death from using this method. Please read anything else."
1,Concern regarding using this book with breastfed babies,"Many of the suggestions and recommendations in this book would be inappropriate for feeding and caring for breastfeed babies. Frequent feedings are often very much apart of a breastfed infants day. Frequent feedings have several advantages: increasing mom's milk supply, helping to prevent engorgement, and helping to establish breastfeeding in general and establishing the bond between mother and child. This book , however, also does not take into consideration growth spurts, during which the infant needs to nurse even more frequently. Schedules and sleeping through the night all sound like good things---but are they really good for all babies (breast or formula)?"
4,GREAT book,"The Babywise series is a controversial book -- there's no denying that. I read it and I do not follow every aspect of the book, but it does have priceless information in it. I'd say, read it and take everything you read with a grain of salt. Use it as a GUIDE, not as a STRICT set of rules that your baby has to follow. YOU know your child and what is best for your child. This book coupled with a dose of common sense is amazing. Our baby suddenly stopped sleeping through the night around 4 months and using the information in this book we have already seen a huge change in his personality and sleep habits in 3 days."
1,Dangerous practices,"Mr. Ezzo paints a nice picture with his theories, but they are unrealistic and his practices can actually be dangerous. The idea that an infant is capable of manipulation is plain ridiculous. Babies need to eat when they are hungry...not when it fits the parent's schedule. Breastfed babies often eat more frequently and serious consequences can be the result if a mother tries to fit the baby to Mr. Ezzo's 4 hour plan.I would not recommend this book to any parent."
5,A Must Read,"I read this book before having our twin sons and then used it once they were born - it helped us so much. We had them on a schedule from the start and they slept through the night between 8 and 12 weeks. This book has excellent suggestions on developing a routine for yourself, your family, and your new addition(s)!Our sons were placed on a rigid 4 hour feeding schedule at the hospital and we kept up with it once we got home - why would we switch to demand feeding?. It made our lives easier to know what to expect and when to expect it. Especially with twins you need to have them on the same schedule otherwise you are feeding a baby 24/7 with no time for yourself or the rest of your family.Do yourself a favor and read this book and use it as a guideline for your new family member. You will be happy when you get the positive results."
1,Not for the nursing mother,If you want to nurse your child this is not the book to follow--way too stringent and strict! You cannot follow these methods and be successful!
5,Best baby advice ever!,"My husbands sisters had all relied on the advice they received in Baby Wise when having all of their children and so I borrowed a copy when we found out we were expecting our first baby. I can't describe the value in the advice offered. It gave sound counsel on how and when to feed your baby and how and when to schedule their nap times. This book gave me the tools necessary to help me and my baby on so many levels. My baby was sleeping through the night by 11 weeks and helped me determine a healthy, functional breastfeeding routine. I'm rereading it now as we're expecting baby number 2 and highly recommend this book to any and all parents."
5,Very Helpful,"This book was recommended to me when I was expecting my boy/girl twins last year. My husband and I decided we would use the book as a guide and always follow our instincts and use common sense first and foremost. We have two healthy, happy twins, age 15 months. They slept through the night at 10 weeks and now they sleep 11 hours at night and take two 2 hours naps during the day. I have recommended this book to others because it has given my children structure. They know what to expect and when to expect it. So many people have commented on how happy the twins are and I credit this book. I highly recommend it!!"
1,The only book I ever threw in the garbage,"I couldn't stand the thought of another parent reading this book and applying these cruel methods of pseudoparenting to their child so I threw this book in the garbage can. Ezzo has no credentials. Parents who have used his methods have seen their children suffer from failure to thrive. Mothers have seen their milk supplies depleted as a result of his strict scheduled feedings. Lawsuits are pending against Ezzo. Ask yourself, do you really want to take a chance with your most precious gift, your children?"
1,babies' wants=needs,"I think that it's best to listen to your baby's needs and respond to them, rather than using behavior modification techniques on infants. They're babies for such a short time- does it hurt to cater to them for the first year? I prefer that my son know that his parents are always there for him- rather than learn he needs to start taking care of himself before he's even grown hair."
1,Don't waste your money.,Ezzo has been proven to be a liar. He has left multiple churches in a scandle. For a Christian he is not very good at practicing the principles of Christianity.
1,The 'me' generation strikes back (at their kids),"This book is one-half common sense tips, and the other half abuse for convenience sake of parents who don't want to be bothered by children - even their own. It will fit nicely in the trash can."
1,"don't waste your $, he is not qualified & sadistic","check out some reviews under his baby wise 2 book they will tell you the same story he is an unwise man with some very sadistic methods for Punishing an innocent child who can not reson at this age boycott all his books instead buy other book from researched, educated, qualified authors."
1,Scary and Sad Advice,"This is a terrible book and a horrifying why to raise your child. Why even have a kid if you're going to treat them in this manner? Just get a dog, it'd be cheaper and easier. I couldn't even finish this book, it just made me sick."
1,parents.....don't be stupid,parents....don't be stupid. Learn to think for yourselves. There have been mothers who have tried this method and have almost starved their babies to near death!!! Is this what you want for your child because you are afraid of them becoming too needy or because this is what your church buddies told you to do?
4,A Worthwhile Read,"I've been following the BabyWise methods for the past 5 days, and last night my 6 week old infant slept 9 hours straight. He had been waking 1-2 times a night up until then. I don't know if it's just coincidence, or the BabyWise schedule, but I'm happy. If you are not willing to let your baby cry, and don't mind having your daily schedule dictated by your baby, this book is not for you. I lived that way for 6 weeks and it didn't work for me. This book has offered my family consistency and predictability in our daily routine. The book does not advocate letting your baby go hungry, nor is it anti-breast feeding. It simply offers a guide for how to get your baby on a ""somewhat"" predictable schedule, with the added benefit of good sleeping habits. Hundreds of people have given this book positive reviews based on the fact that the advice worked for them, and I don't think any of those people starved their babies!"
4,On Becoming Baby Wise,My order was shipped in a timely matter. It was nice that the book was wrapped in tissue so that it wouldn't get damaged in the mail.
1,Babywise is anything but!,"A family member gave me the Babywise book when my son was about a month old. At the time his days and nights were mixed up, but we were otherwise doing fine. I read the book and started using Ezzo's methods and before I knew it, I was having a problem with my milk supply. We had been doing great before I started using this book, and after it we had problems for the rest of our breast feeding relationship. Gary Ezzo is not a doctor, and in my opinion, does not have the knowlege that would qualify him to speak on these (feeding in particular) subjects. I threw the book in the garbage where it belongs."
2,Long-term effects...,"Sleep deprovation can drive any sane person to the brink, however it is a fact of life if you have decided to become a parent. Whether you are up feeding, comforting or just worrying-children's needs are not always ""convenient"".Adopting a ""schedule"" seems to make sense, but has its consequences. As much as routine equates security it does not speak to raising a self-confident child that can adapt and overcome. This program which was a savior during the first 3-6 months became a burden. Life revolved around their schedules which became difficult to change. There is no flexibliy for special events, family functions, holidays etc, which meant we all missed out, well into pre-school.Stiking a balance without rigidity is key. That's why this book is not a total loser. But read it and adapt the parts that you need. Remember, you, your child and family are unique and abolutely no one knows your children better than you."
2,Good In Theory,"This book gets a 5 star rating in theory and parenting styles. However, there are a few contradictions in the reading (minor but there) and unless your baby is the picture perfect infant (no colic, reflux, pyloric stenosis, etc.) then the book probably is not for you. Just keep in mind that a lot of what is out there will all be different and tell you different ways to parent. In other words no one book is right, especially this one. Makes a good coster though."
1,Shocked Amazon sells this still,"Any book that advocates child neglect and abuse should NOT be sold by Amazon or ANY company, and I am shocked and disappointed that any parent could neglect their child by leaving them alone to cry themselves to sleep.Being a parent is a 24/7 job. A baby is not an inconvenience only to be parented from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. It is not spoiling, but LOVE, that makes a good parent tend to their child at 2 in the morning. It is not NATURAL for a new baby to sleep through the night - even adults don't do so.This book needs burned, and I will be contacting Amazon's buyers to question their judgement on promoting a book which advocates such abuse. This is unacceptable."
1,Dangerous with breastfeeding,"WARNING - Do not use this book with breastfeeding. I know a doctor at our local hospital who says they have many cases of Failure to Thrive because of this book. I have also watched my best friend's son go from 25th percentile to 10th percentile and now to 5th percentile because of this book. He is now off the breast and drinking formula. She had a lot of milk because this was her third child, but this book caused it to dry up!"
1,This book is perfect!,"It's just the right thickness to prop up that wobbly table in my basement! What a piece of garbage....the book, not the table."
1,Not recommended,"The author has been condemned by several churches (including his own) and the methods he recommends have been condemned by the American Academy of Pediatrics.There are plenty of baby books out there that aren't dangerous, there's no reason to use this one."
1,Buyer beware,"Before you try the tactics in this book, please visit www.Ezzo.Info for statements against this method from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, pediatricians and ministers. Neither the author nor his wife are qualified to give such advice that can cause such emotional and physical devastation. It is phyisologically dangerous to allow your infant to ""cry it out,"" leading to excessive blood pressure readings, skyrocketing cortisol, and dangerous brain reactions that can influence your baby years later. Not worth it, choose a healthier method to set your baby up for sleep success."
4,Baby Wise is a must read for new parents,"I read all parenting books warily. This one has a great Bible based theory for training your baby. And Babies can be trained. I have definately seen the benefits to putting my baby on a schedule and I've practiced many of the methods of Baby Wise with two of my three babies and have seen the positive results. I'm not disciplined enough myself to practice all the recommendations that Ezzo prescribes, but what I have done has helped.I would say,even if you don't end up trying out the methods of Baby Wise, the benefits of the read are great."
5,Great Baby Book!!,My DR. recomended this book 4 years ago with my 2nd baby and it took a little getting used to but we LOVED it and used with the 3rd baby as well! I also BF my children and had no problems with nursing and following this plan. It gave baby a much better eat and sleep routine and game me a routine as well to structure our awake time and sleep time!
4,Satisfied customer,"This is a great way to shop, knowing that the product will be delivered in good condition and in a timely fashion; gives me confidence to continue buying books this way in the future."
3,Good buy,Fast shipment... the book was dirty and some of the pages were bent although it did say that it was new. Other than that it was good!
5,Its OK to cry.,"The author is clear that this book is not for everyone. Babywise is designed to lead infants to be secure in the real, imperfect world. If you desire to protect your child from the imperfections of life (i.e. prevent all crying at all costs), then this book is not for you. If you value the benefit of your child learning how to comfort themselves when they go to sleep, sleep through the night, wake up happy, be alert through the day, and content when not being held by mom, then the practices prescribed in this book, which includes allowing your baby to cry at appropriate times, will get your there. Reading comments from those opposed to the book you would think the author prescribes ""causing"" your baby to cry, which is not true. Crying is natural, and certain crying is good. If you do not accept this premise, then as other have said, its best to find another book. Father of twin boys."
4,On Becoming Baby Wise,I have the hard copy of this book as well. It is a helpful book that just makes sense. The narator is kind of hard to listen to at times but the content is good. You may want to get the book as well so you can see the lay out and schedules better.
3,"Principles, not law...","This book is not for everyone and I don't believe it is meant to be used without parent instinct and flexibility.I think the basic principles are worth a try in the beginning but if it is not working for you, then feel free to adjust and make changes. Perhaps coming back to the this in a few months might make the difference. Personally, I followed the advice in this book for my first child and I would say it didn't really start to consistently take effect until around 2-3 months. Some babies fall into this routine very easily and some not. I think the key is to follow the principle of guiding and teaching your babies into routine and structure. Many would agree that this principle can be carried out in many different ways. Pay attention to your gut. It's there for a reason. But, also remain consistent and firm once you have made a sure commitment. It is sure to pay off...Enjoying the Ride"
3,A helpful guide not a rule of thumb!,"Take the book for what it's worth and don't try so hard to read between every single line. As first time parents, it provided a useful tool to let us know some of the ins and outs of parenting. Parenting skills are not completely innate. Why else would parents ask for advice and suggestions or read books and magazine articles? No, we certainly didn't agree with everything Ezzo said nor did we follow his hour to hour, minute to minute schedule but it was a helpful tool in learning what worked best for us as a unit...a family. Babies love nothing better than a schedule and you won't hear any complaints out of me. Use it as a helpful guide and not a rule of thumb. I don't know about you but at this stage in parenthood, I'm not ready to be cruel to be kind."
1,Not practical for very young babies.,This book was given to us when our twins were less than a month old. I felt the book did not provide adequate information on at what ages the techniques would work the best. It focussed on keeping your baby awake after each bottle which we found extremely difficult to do with one month olds. It seemed very against what babies want to naturally do after they eat - sleep. The suggestions in the book might be more helpful to older infants. I think there are other more practical books on the market.
1,This book could be dangerous for your baby,"I showed this book to my baby's doctor and he told me that many pediatricians are critical of it. Evidently the scheduled feedings have resulted in low weight gain and other problems with babies. I thought the book made a great deal of sense until I read the information and research he gave me that said otherwise. He said that the techniques may work, but that they are not what is best for the baby. He recommended books by Dr. William Sears, Penolope Leech, and T. Berry Brazelton instead. I thought this was important for others to know."
5,Great Book (I'm a parent of multiples too),"As you can tell by the other reviews, this is either a love it or hate type of book. My wife and I absolutely loved this book and have recommended it to several friends who swear by this book as well. My wife and I have twins and getting them on a schedule was a necessity for us. They turn two this week and still sleep 12-13 hours a night and take at least a two hour nap. We've never had any problems many of the opponents of this book scare you about. We're expecting our third child this summer and will definitely use this method again."
5,It is worth it!,"After our baby was two weeks old, we implemented the principles of this book. Our baby started sleeping through the night at 6 weeks old, and was well in the average as the book mentioned. He is now two months old, and he is sleeping 12 hours like the book said. The first 4-6 weeks might be rough for mom more than the baby, but it is worth it. There is peace at home, and time to take care of other things once the baby is on a schedule. The book has very practical advise, and it is very sensitive to all the issues. But parents have to be willing to let their babies cry at the beginning. Now my baby doesn't cry at all to take a nap. 6 weeks out of the rest of my baby's life to get good sleeping habits, it is worth it!!! Be flexible if you need to. If you can't stand the baby cry, go to www.babygotosleep.com, my second tool of choice, and it also works!"
4,The book works with your own common sense approach.,"This book works. Putting babies on a schedule is necessary for the parent and the child. I used this book's scheduling methods with both of my children to get them on a schedule as newborns. When it warranted, I varied and used my own common sense regarding feeding the child. I disagree with the negative reviews of this book I think all parents must use their own discretion when trying anyone else's ideas regarding parenting. I KNOW that children thrive on schedules not utter chaos. I have friends and neighbors whose children don't sleep, don't nap, eat on demand and they are miserable children who are miserable to be around and drive their parents to medicate themselves! So, those who criticize Ezzo and Bucknam, good luck with your harried lives ruled by whining children. I don't advocate abusing children or military like schedules, just some normalcy which this book helps to achieve."
1,no way jose!,"I was recommended this book during my pregnancy and thought that the writing style was very enthralling but all of the actual material in the book was just awful. You train dogs, not children. Infants need to grow up in secure loving enviroments by giving parents. If you don't have the time or patience for a baby, this book is good for you. if you want to be a loving parent, read Dr. Sears instead. He is an actual MD not a Joe Shmoe off the street (like Ezzo) trying to make parenting seem more convenient."
1,"please find other ""experts"" to help you learn how to parent","Everyone wants a good night's sleep, but this is no answer. He offers the seductive idea that your life can be like it was before you had a baby--predictable, ordered--and while this may or may not be true this is a cruel way to effect that end."
4,I've tried it and it works,"Before trying Babywise, I read many parenting books. I also read the many negative reviews on Amazon and throughout the internet on Babywise parenting. Being a first time mother, I was afraid to try Babywise for fear of harming my child. However, after 6 weeks of little sleep and the resulting lack of energy and patience, I was desperate. So I tried babywise. At three months, my baby not only sleeps through the night, but he is in the 97th percentile for height and weight. I always get comments on how alert and happy he is. I gave babywise only 4 stars because it was sometimes confusing and not always well written. But the majority of the claims I've read refuting babywise are taking babywise out of context."
1,This is mean parenting,"This book is terrible, what it advocates are CIO and timed feedings both of which are not beneficial to a child. If you want a parenting book I suggest the DR. William Sears baby book. It will explain with documented cited sourced facts and information as to why ""baby wise"" parenting is wrong and harmful to your child. NO babies are the same and there is no ""way"" or ""schedule"" that a child is set to follow. Babies espeacily those that are breast feed want to suckle not only for substance but for comfort a feeling of closeness that they shared with you in the womb, why deny them of that? CIO that's a good way for your child to mistrust you. Crying is the way children communicate and for a parent not to respond to a childs cries demeans the child. How can a parent listen to thier little one cry, your little one simply wants to be with you, again why deny them of that. Please,Please read up on other methods for the benefit of your child."
1,Unwise for parents,"On Becoming Baby Wise is contrary to most evidence-based knowledge about infant development and successful breastfeeding. How sad to think that over 1,000,000 babies may have been subjected to these methonds.There are dozens of appropriate books out there. We recommend The No-Cry Sleep Solution by Pankey among others."
1,not helpful,"Although this book was recommended to me by my peds Dr., Baby Wise did me absolutely no good! I got it because at 4 months, my child was still waking up every two hours. The first thing I read was that I was a horrible mother because my child, unlike the 96% of normal babies, was not sleeping for 8 hours straight in the first weeks of his life. I tried really hard to use the strategies in the book, but after almost a month, his sleeping patterns were worse, and I was exhausted. We resorted to crying it out (which worked like a charm). I wish I had not wasted my time with this book."
3,Mostly just common sense...,"I ordered this book when my daughter was about 2 1/2 weeks old. We wanted to learn how to help her get more deep sleep, because she was only sleeping about 30 minutes at a time due to acid reflux. The book simply recommends (after bashing all other types of parenting styles) that you establish a routine of eat-activity-sleep. This wasn't something that I necessarily needed a book to teach me.Our daughter is now 10 weeks old and only wakes up once a night to eat and that only happens about 50% of the time. It doesn't have anything to do with what the book taught us, it has to do with the fact that we established our own bedtime routine for her of bath-lotion-pajamas-bottle and she knows that it is time to sleep.I would say skip the book unless you are completely lost as to how to get Baby to sleep."
4,Short and Sweet,Using this book as a GUIDELINE...not as a Textbook/Bible...our child was sleeping through the night at 6 weeks.
3,OK but Weissbluth Better,"I read this book excited that we would be able to get our daughter into a routine and a healthy sleeping pattern. When it came to implementing however, we found that the suggestions were not that practical and did not really work out.The book has merits for recommending a structure and not going down the ridiculous 'attachment parenting' method. But having said that I found Marc Weissbluth's Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child to be much more practical and a lot more scientifically sound (Weissbluth is a child sleep specialist) and it worked a treat with our daughter as it is co-ordinated to your baby's natural sleep cycle."
1,Buyer Beware,"Gary Ezzo has no credentials (other than being a parent, who's children won't even have anything to do with him). Please check out ezzo.info before you purchase this book."
1,Babywise is HORRIBLE,"Please read up on the controversies surrounding Babywise! Ezzo parenting has only been linked to problems, few successes, and even with successes they are short-term and the kids who are raised Ezzo-style have some serious problems. Every copy of this book should be burned and this man should be locked away forever. Dehydration and neglect are some of the problems linked to advice from this book, and in it are several unfounded medical claims!!!"
5,a widely misunderstood book,"My husband and I used the Babywise information to train our newborn son to sleep for 10 hours a night. He is still breastfeeding at age 2, and has been getting full nights of sleep since 4 weeks old. He is well-rested and alert, very smart, and also very secure. We have not experienced any of the problems suggested by the ""anti-Ezzo"" camp. This book has good information for parents of most children (special needs such as preemies or ill-newborns may require a different method of care), and especially for mothers who are returning to work postpartum, which I did, and was able to continue breastfeeding my son exclusively until he was 7 months and started eating solid foods. As with any parenting book, you need to read it and then decide what will work best for you. We didn't use all the information in Babywise, but what we did use worked really well."
5,Used this book for both of my babies!,"Just read it yourself from page one to the last page before reading any of the ridiculous claims. Just think about it. If this book is being used by thousands of women and is as dangerous as some people claim, shouldn't there be thousands of babies in the hospial starving or dying from the PDF (parent directed feeding) approach of caring for an infant? No matter which method you look at you will be able to find mother's who don't do it the right way by accident or on purpose. Just use COMMON SENSE! I would have gone crazy with out this book! I gave this book to at least 10 other mother's who said the same thing! And some of them were not Christians."
1,On ecoming Baby Wise,"I was absolutely appalled when I read this book. the authors promote, in my opinion, child abuse. The only way I could possibly recommend this book to any parent would be if they WANTED to raise a child conditioned to accept abuse from any authority figure during their lifetime. Denying a small infant food and comfort merely because an adult wants to sleep is highly irresponsible."
1,BABYWISE techniques are linked to Baby Dehydration and Failure to Thrive!,"[...]Please go to the link above and do your research before fallowing the advice of someone posing as though they know what they are talking about. Babies are suffering because of these techniques, and I would rate this book a ""0""."
1,DANGEROUS BOOK-INFANT MALNUTRITION,"I bought this book on a recommendation. When I started reading I became suspicious in the first three chapters. I am currently in a Graduate Program in Clinical Psychology and the author begins to refute Attachment Theory principles, thus, I became concerned. I did some research on this book and actually discovered the author is neither trained in psychology, child development, or medicine. He has a Master's in Divinity, yikes!!! I guess this is why his biography is not inlcuded in the book. This book prompted the AAP to issue a statement about these practices that could lead to infant malnutrition and failure to thrive ([...]). This man is preying on new mothers and pushing his incorrect idealogy as childcare. THe publisher even severed their relationship with the author.Horrible horrible person. Please Please do your research before purchasing. I was fooled but as soon as I realized how dangerous his practices are this book was thrown out."
1,But what does it accomplish?,"I have no doubt that the ""techniques"" in this book may ""work"" for some parents. But what is accomplished? One may get their life on schedule and their world ""in control,"" but parenting is not about having things the way you want them, it is about meeting the needs of children. This book fails to address that. Parent-Directed feeding, for example--how would you like for someone else to create an arbitrary feeding schedule for YOU and tell you that, no matter how hungry you may get, you CANNOT eat until the next schduled feeding?Children deserve respect and unconditional love, and this book provides no support for either."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"There are many unsubstantiated (or just plain wrong) medical facts in this book. Ezzo is notorius for his negligent and abusive reccommendations. Babies have suufered malnurishment, dehydration, failure to thrive and even death because of parents following his program. He has no credentials and is not an ""expert"" of any kind. Do yourself a favor and save your money!"
1,i wish i could give this book zero stars,"buy this book if you think babies should be left to cry, alone and frightened. buy this book if the idea of underfeeding your baby appeals to you. buy this book if you really think a teeny tiny newborn can be spoiled or can manipulate you. but if you buy this book, be forewarned that your child may be frightened, poorly attached, even undernourished and severely delayed. there are a panoply of parenting websites (parentsplace, amitymama) where parents who have tried the ezzo ""method"" share their regrets with others. check them out, and then discard any thoughts of buying this dangerous hogwash. instead of wasting your time and money, pick your baby up, love him or her and follow your own personal instincts about what the baby needs instead of letting this evil man convince you that nurturing your baby is wrong."
4,A True Believer!,"I would recommend this book to any parent who wants to sleep through the night again! Our son's pediatrician recommended this book to us at his 6 week appointment, but we ignored the advice. After she recommended it again at his 2 month appointment we decided to give it a shot. He was sleeping through the night within 2 weeks of putting him on the Baby Wise schedule! The only complaint I have about the book is that they are pretty vague about how the schedule should change as the baby gets older. I guess by that time they should be sleeping through the night so it's not such a big deal. I am a true beleiver in the Baby Wise schedule and will continue to recommend this book to family and friends."
1,No to Baby Wise,"I was given both Baby Wise books ten years ago from my mother-in-law when our first baby was born. Unfortunately, after reading the book our first year was difficult at times because the book philosophy didn't really work. Some of the information in the Babywise books is helpful, but the same information is available in other baby books on the market. Advice to moms from a mom of four little ones age 10 and under, go with your instincts and don't read so many baby books. Find friends, fellow parents you can trust, and ask them questions. Then make your own decision."
1,This book is just wrong!,"I was given this book as a gift. Some of the ideas sounded a little harsh but I tried them for a while just to be fair. Horrible! My daughter was not gaining weight properly and the 'sleep schedule' was more like a screaming schedule. Finally I asked her pediatrician. He told me to throw Ezzo away and that a number of his patients had similar problems with his program. The doctor told me to be sensible. If a rabbit is smart enough to know when it is hungry so is my baby. Same with sleeping. Not that we are animals, but that hunger is a basic need and denying the baby food because it isn't 'time yet' just seems cruel. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,"Dumbing Down Parents, Far From Wise Parenting","It is a rarity that I would assign a zero to a book, yet if Amazon allowed it, that is what On Becoming Baby Wise would get. Ezzo, a man whom happens to have an enterprise built around _his_ self-perceived assumptions toward the manner in which parents should raise their kids, presents the book. As a Christian Father, I issue strong discouragement against this publication and others by this man. They are resembling of the 'burn in hell' control mechanisms from days ago. Thankfully God issues free will and discernment gifting to dads and moms, allowing them to see the deception of this man. Avoid this book, it is about control, not healthy parenting."
1,Ezzo is NO expert,"Gary Ezzo does NOT like children. He DOES like being known as the EXPERT; consequently, he thrives on the inexperience of ""first time"" parents. His advice on breastfeeding is bogus; most women who follow his [bad] advice lose their milk at anywhere from four to six months. Babies who are raised on his artificial schedule and allowed to ""Cry It Out"" often develop various levels of detatchment disorder and many Ezzo babies(as they are called in the hospitals) have been diagnosed as ""Failure to thrive."" For more on this, go to [website]If what you want is to learn to trust you instincts and to be a calm, solid, nurturing mom or dad, read Dr. Sears, or T Barry Brazelton. These men love children."
4,Use Common Sense!,"I've been reading the reviews and in response to the negative reviews about this book I ask you...Did we read the same one? This book is an excellent resource and has worked very well with my first son who is now 4 months old and sleeps through the night. He is thriving and has already doubled his birth weight. Ezzo never said ""ignore your baby's crys."" His book gets you to think about why your baby is crying. He never said ""train"" your child. He said parent your child. This book helps you to really think about each situation in your child's life so that you can really get to know your baby and better be able to meet his or her needs. Use what works for you and ignore what doesn't. Being flexible is the key and by the way Ezzo talks about flexibility in almost every chapter. This is definatley not the rigid, cruel approach so many are making it out to be. I recommend this book to be used along side What to Expect the First Year. Good Luck!"
4,Use this book wisely,"A friend recommended this book to me before I had my baby and I have to say that it was helpful when used as a reference in conjunction with recommendations from my pediatrician, family and friends.I've found that it's always good to read how others approach things to make a better informed decision. So, while I can appreciate the negative reviews and am all for diversity of viewpoints, those with common sense know that no one book should be the ""bible"" and a mother's instinct still rules."
1,Educate yourself,"I read this book - if you are a supporter, or considering being one, first look at www.ezzo.info, most notably How Ezzo's Child-Rearing Philosophy Impacts Psychosocial and Physical Development or look at the Harvard study regarding the 'cry-it-out' method. http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/04.09/ChildrenNeedTou.html"
3,"Interesting, If Not Scientifically Verifiable","I am not going to jump into the debate about whether the methods prescribed by the authors are good, or whether the authors pray to Satan (as some reviewers would have you believe).In my view, the book was interesting, if not scientifically verifiable. Be forewarned that a vast majority of the book is a synopsis of modern child psychology, or pseudo-psychology. A very small portion deals with the ""method"".Also, the book has a pronounced pro-breastfeeding, almost anti-bottlefeeding slant.Finally, as with all methods, it should be practiced with fliexiblity and common sense. Only you know your baby."
5,RELAX,"Everyone seems to be freaking out about the author's credentials but even if all that is true, it doesn't mean his philosophy is unworthy of looking at. I read the book and implemented it with my son with amazing results. My baby is so happy and content. He is 10 weeks old and sleeps 8 hours at night. I know that when he cries he is hungry. He simply does not cry any other time because he is content and well rested. My church has a babywise club and several mothers get together to support each other and this method. Our kids are all so content and well behaved. The results speak for themselves."
1,Child abuse in print,"I bought this book thinking that it showed some new technique to help babies sleep. I was amazed with the ideas in the book. Letting a baby cry to sleep and let the baby sleep in its vomit is surely abuse. My son sleeps 12 hours straight every night and has no problems taking naps, but he never cried to sleep. The book went to the trash as soon as I was finished reading it. My son is well adjusted and with patience and routine, he learned to calmly go to bed after our bedtime ritual, a book and a song. We have the same routine since he was a newborn, he knows we will be by his side if he cries, he knows we love him and because of that, he sleeps peacefully. New parents be aware that letting your baby cry is not the solution to sleepless nights. Trust yourselves, not a horrible book. Love your kids, do not torture them. Kids need love and consistence."
1,I have seen more mothers cry over this book than any other,"As a pediatrician, I have more than a handful of moms reduced to tears listening to their baby cry through its hunger for hours because this book says it is what you should do. This is insane. If a baby is hungry, you must feed it. Period. If you don't want to do that, then I strongly suggest you get a gold fish or some low maintenance pet, because clearly parenting is not for you. Thankfully I have not had any failure to thrive babies yet because of this book, but it is because the moms who have used this book were smart enough to call me rather than blindly follow Ezzo's advice."
4,Great Book!,This book is a great reference. I love the idea of a schedule....very helpful. My son...who is 2 months old has been sleeping 7-8 hours through the night....and I really dont let him cry too much. The only idea in this book I do not agree on is letting your baby cry it out. Maybe when your baby is older...but they need the security when they are young. However...I do agree on everything else in this book. I believe the 3 hour schedule and the eat...wake...sleep cycle is very important.
4,A big help for first-time parents,"As first-time parents, we were clueless. We read this book and it helped us tremendously. Our son fell right into a routine and the schedules helped us plan our days and helped with breast feeding. There are times you need to be flexible and use your common sense (as the book urges as well). Trust your own instincts as well.Our son is thriving (at 2 months he was almost double his birth weight, a goal usually at 6 months). He is extremely happy and healthy and is a very content baby. We love him to death.Many medical professionals discourage the use of this book saying children don't thrive following its principles without saying WHY they don't thrive. I think it is because people follow this book to the letter, don't trust their instincts, and forget to be flexible. Those are the keys to success."
3,Judging others,It seems like a lot of people are judging parents who are looking for methods to help their children sleep. This book along with countless other books giving advice are not a substitute for your maternal instinct. Before you judge this book or the people buying it remember that many mothers are single moms with other children. They work for a living and must provide love and support to the rest of their families and do not have the luxury of feeding on demand or rocking their children to sleep. That doesn't mean that they can't be wonderful parents. What is better for the child...a few nights or weeks of crying or having a sleep deprived mother who may lose her job and means for feeding and caring for her family or who may resent her child and become abusive or neglectful to her children. Stop judging.
5,Best book I read,"Several friends told us we must read this book and they were right. Our child slept through the night at 8 weeks. He is now 2 years old and is sweet, loving and well behaved. I recommend this book to all my friends."
1,Run!,"If you love your child, and I know you do, Run away from this book!You can force your baby to submitt to a schedule, but the way Ezzo does it causes your baby to lose trust in you and can break his heart.Some have had success, but this book has caused many babies to suffer from failure to thrive. Google it and you will see the frightening examples.It's not worth it, there are kinder ways to help your child sleep.Try, the No Cry Sleep Solution, it takes longer, but isn't YOUR baby worth it?"
1,Who the hell is Gary Ezzo!!!???,"Why, why, why do we insist on forcing our infants to sleep through the night LONG before they are ready?!?!? Why are we ignoring an infants NEED to wake during the night!?!?!? Why are we trying to convince ourselves that it is OK to leave an infant cold, frightened, anxious, lonely in her crib??!!! Babywise and the CIO method are the Atkins diet of the parenting world.... an unnatural, quick fix. If you're not ready to get up during the night with a baby, then don't have one."
1,Not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics,"The author of this book is not a pediatrician. He bases his idea of how to ""structure"" your new baby's experience on excerpts from the bible. The book available on Amazon is a secular version...the earliest versions integrate bible quotes. Those who are inflexible in following the outlines of this book can truly endanger their children. Flexibility is the key. Babies cry for a reason. You cannot spoil a newborn. If you would like to attempt to participate in ""Healthy 2010"" CDC goals for the United States, or if you believe in following the American Academy of Pediatrics goals of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life in order to benefit your child, emotionally, physically and spiritually, do not buy this book. Buy ""the Happiest Baby on the Block"" instead. I am a women's health nurse, a parent educator and lactation educator practicing in California, and recommend ""the Happiest Baby on the Block"" because it is a great book!"
1,dangerous--please look elsewhere,"This book is an incredible dangerous book for first time parents. Whether or not you believe in the Crying it Out Method, this book sets up mothers, especially nursing mothers for failure. It can contribute to babies depression as they learn to give up on their parents who are not responding to their needs. They can fail to thrive while parent are sticking to the schedule. Ezzo has been repeatedly criticized for his misinformation. This is not Christian parenting. Responding to a child's needs at this early age is not spoiling it is making sure he's changed, not hungry, and loved. Please do more research on your choice of parenting books. Please look Ezzo up on the web and get both sides of this story. I urge you to trust yourself and not let people who don't know you or your baby to dictate how you should handle your child."
1,Want a routine? Use another book.,"This book starts from the principle that babies are bad and manipulative and your job as parents is to make them conform to whatever you desire. If you are that selfish, maybe you shouldn't be having children?The AAP recommends against it. The church Ezzo was from severed all ties with him."
1,Did not like this at all,"This book went completly against my insticts. If my baby is hungry, I will feed him, if he is tired, he can sleep; regardless of the order that happens. The Eat, Activity, Sleep cycle did not work for us. And since my baby did not fit the model, I felt like a failure. This book did not help my confidence and did not help us settle into a routine. It is not a priority of mine that my son sleep through the night. He will only be a baby once and I want to enjoy every minute of it instead of worrying about the EAS cycle."
1,Mothers instinct ignores,"I thought this book plays on a young mothers insecurities, encouraging tiny babies to 'learn' when they are hungry? I wonder what mothers did for the 1,000's of years before books? Oh no! they trusted there instincts! they picked up a crying baby! they fed it when it was hungry!And as far as being christian..can you see mary with baby jesus crying and her with a watch telling her when to feed him? hmmmmmmNEVER RECOMMEND BOOK."
1,This book should be burned,"Babies have died from parents following the advice of this godforsaken book. It is awful and a selfish way to raise your baby. DO NOT buy this book. Follow your instincts, trust your gut - feed your baby when it is hungry, sleep with it, she or he will grow up secure and healthy.I wanted to give this zero stars but that was not an option. If you see this book at your bookstore, ask them not to carry it. If you see it at the library - mis-shelve it or better yet - throw it out!!!"
1,Please don't endanger your baby by using this book,"This book advocates the establishment of strict control over an infant by the parents, including letting the baby ""cry it out"", and strict feeding schedules. The AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) advises strongly against scheduling feedings for newborns as it may lead to poor weight gain, dehydration, and failure to thrive. Gary Ezzo does not have any medical background, and makes a number of misleading medical statements in this book. In fact, the church where Ezzo established the babywise practice has seperated itself from Ezzo. Babies need love, care, and closeness to their parents, not distance and scheduling. Please safeguard your baby's health by using the advice of your pediatrician or other medical professional, and NOT Ezzo's."
1,This book is ridiculous!,I got this book thinking it would help my baby learn to sleep better. I was shocked to read the author's plan on how to parent my child. The writers of this book should be ashamed of themselves for insinuating that if I nurse my baby when he cries that I am setting him up for obesity and a poor mental state. I was apalled at the way they suggest letting your child cry alone for 45 minutes in order for the parents to get a full 8 hour minimum sleep stretch at night. I think this book is only for parents who are unable to think for themselves and need someone to tell them it is okay to disregard your child's feelings if it serves your own purpose. A TERRIBLE READ and I would recommend this book to no one. I can't decide whether to throw it away or give it to someone looking for it so at least one more copy will not be purchased.
5,I have such a happy baby!,"There is a lot of contraversy over this book, but I would just like to say that this book worked wonderfully for my baby, myself and my family. I don't see that there is anything cruel about it at all- the author does NOT suggest that you allow your child to cry for hours on end. My 9 month- old son is in the 95th percentile in height and weight (not starving, as some reviewers claim). And he a joyous and extremely happy child! He smiles and giggles and is quite attached to me! He takes comfort in the routine that I have created for him, a routine that is quite flexible. This method may not work for every family, but I found it to be quite useful."
2,there's a better book,"I have read and instituted the practices in Babywise. I got mixed results. He advocates an eat, play, sleep schedule which I still find useful. However, his methods are a bit extreme. I found much more helpful advice in Dr. Marc Weisbluth's book, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. He gives concrete information on how long a child of a particular age should sleep during the day/night and how long they should be awake between naps. It has been a life-saver!"
5,I love Baby Wise,"I was given this book as a gift. I was having trouble getting my 8 week old on any kind of schedule. Within 3 days, he was on a Schedule, and by 10 weeks old he was sleeping through the night. It has been a life saver for me!It works!"
1,Dangerous and misleading advice,"The AAP has investigated Ezzo's parent directed feeding program because of concern that it can lead to dehydration and failure to thrive. Babies are not meant to eat on a schedule, nor are they meant to sleep through the night as early as Ezzo would have you believe. In my family, we slept with our babies and let them nurse throughout the night. We all slept very well, and my children never had ear infections, gastroenteritis, asthma, or any other health problems that can keep children and parents awake. Please, for your own sake and the health of your baby, read Dr. Sears' books instead."
1,Horrible Book,"I'd rate it with a zero if I could. Ezzo's whole concept is just ridiculous and I can't see how it is beneficial for mom or baby. The part that gets me really irritated is that new moms that have no idea where to start can take this guy's writing as a godsend. But I warn any mom out there that making a baby adhere to a schedule will just make you crazy. The book itself annoyed me, the concepts annoyed me, and the fact that people actually continue to buy into the ideas in the book really concerns me. I just hope at least one mom reads this and believes me. There are plenty of awesome baby advice books out there. Try a Dr. Sears book or just plain follow your instincts!!!"
1,Cruel and unusual punishment,"This book is horrible. I was recommended this book by many of my friends, and after reading it, it seemed like the author thinks there is only one type of personality a baby may have, and that personality needs to be controlled, just like the baby's schedule needs to be controlled, and every other aspect of the baby. While a schedule certainly does have a place in a baby's life, it doesn't need to be this rigid. The reality is that all babies have different needs and parents need to be sensitive to them. A baby cries because it's the only way they can communicate their needs."
1,Important facts you should know.....,"Don't buy this book.Gary Ezzo is an alleged Christian pastor with no medical background that writes on these medical topics despite almost universal criticism from real doctors. He has been excommunicated from at least one church and dismissed from another over this book.Just plug ""babywise"" into your browser on the 'Net to verify these things......This guy was even dropped from his publisher!BabyUNwise is way more accurate!Check out the books by Dr. Sears on this site instead. (I used them and my baby slept through the night at five weeks......a fluke.....maybe....but I thought his advice was great!)Ezzo's books are gaining disfavor so fervently at this point, I am sure they won't be available in another couple of years, anyway..."
1,God would not approve of GKGW- [...],[...] to find out why Babywise is so detrimental and NOT biblically soundthe LORD wants mothers to nurse their babies -- when the babies need them to do so -- without punishing an infant for being in need
1,Misinformation,"This is one of the worst parenting books that I have read in a long time. To me is reminds me of a book to learn how to train animals. For those parents who do not care about their children then happy reading, while you are at it put a leash on the baby and take it for a walk.JMO,Davidhttp://www.davidhouse.com"
1,potentially damaging to a baby's development,"The ""advice"" by these ...""experts"" is in my opinion potentially damaging both to the physical and emotional health of a newborn. A hungry newborn is not crying in order to manipulate his/her parent and thus cause marital problems and sleep deprivation. Although the authors would seem to prefer that the ""demanding"" newborn take care of his/her own needs without disturbing his/her parents, this is simply not physiologically possible; a baby is completely dependent on his/her parents for survival. If parents choose to listen to this ""advice"" and train their children as if they were pets, I predict that some years from now they will be dealing with insecure, emotionally distant children. Want to read some good books? Dr. Sears, Dr. Leach, and Dr. Brazelton have all written wonderful books about nurturing parenting. When making parenting decisions, please consider what is best for your child rather than what is convenient for you."
1,This book promotes child abuse,"This is on the must avoid list. These methods are not conducive to raising happy, healthy, well adjusted children. Studies have shown that ""crying-it-out""actually causes brain damage in infants; and as for disciplining a baby, they don't understand the reason for your discipline. Definitely not good advice to give to any parent."
5,more sleep,"THis book helped me get more sleep as a new mom than any other book I read. My baby thrived when I used these concepts to guide her to a happy healthy routine for both of us. I LOVED IT, and highly recommend it for all expectant parents."
1,cry baby cry,"This is just another version of the ""Cry it Out"" method. Sure, it's structured, and if you don't mind having a rigid schedule and letting your baby cry himself to sleep, or be forced into becoming self-soother straight out of the womb, be my guest. People seem to love it, but I didn't. Neither did my baby."
1,Beware of Ezzo's irresponsible advice,"Ezzo should have checked his assertions with lactation consultants. His advice to schedule breastfeeding is a practice that is known to continuously reduce a mother's milk supply. (...)Ezzo's advice makes it difficult or impossible for mothers to follow the recommendations of the US Surgeon General, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization, all of which advocate extended breastfeeding.New parents beware of irresponsible authors such as Ezzo."
4,Essentail Book for the new Mom,"This book has the ""why"" behind the need for wisdom when helping your infant establish early patterns of eating and sleeping that will have lifetime rewards! Highly recommend."
1,"this book is not thinking about your baby but you, not good, not right","This book should not be the only book you read., its written for people wanting to be a modern day parent,who dont want any difficulty., wake up babies require energy and should be willing to giveResearch done by Notre Dame university clearly shows this approach does not benefit your child in the long run. You are inly helpin you not them.It may make your life easier but not your babies. If you schedule feeding you run the risk of ruining your breastmilk supply. Breast is best. It s is just one year out of your life to create a healthy and secure being, some of the stuff in this book goes against what comes naturally. Be wise.. and this book isnt the way"
3,Good theory. . .,"This did help me with getting my 7 week old on more of a schedule. I don't agree with everything and tend to lean more toward's the Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child approach since it is more scientifically approached and researched. However, it was good easy reading and gave me some ideas."
4,"An excellent GUIDE, not a Bible","This is an excellent guide for mothers that need structure in their own lives. My greatest fear while I was pregnant was sleep deprivation. The basic principle of this book, feed your child on a schedule so they will organize their days and nights, worked for us. Our little girl is breast fed and growing, and she slept through the night at 7 weeks. Like any advice book, use your brain to evaluate and adapt what works for you as a parent."
1,The worst parenting advice I've ever seen,"This is a crazy book. The scheduling is so confining that you would be unable to have any life at all. There is no room for flexibility, such as going out of the house to do errands. The strict feeding schedule is incompatible with hungry babies. Yes, your life will change when your baby arrives, but you can incorporate the baby into your life. I've read many parenting books and would recommend ""The Baby Book"" by William Sears M.D. and Martha Sears R.N. Also, for breastfeeding mothers, I caution that by following Ezzo's recommendations for feeding scheduling, you will in effect be reducing your milk supply and will end up with a crying, unhappy baby. Follow the AAPs breastfeeding guidelines instead, which are to breastfeed when the baby shows signs of hunger (not a schedule) and that crying is a late indication of hunger."
1,Please don't use this book,"This is one of the very few 'baby training' methods which the American Academy of Pediatrics warns against using as babies whose parents who follow these methods have been diagnosed with failure to thrive, and some have even died.The Ezzo's adult children are completely estranged from him. That really says it all. It destroys the bonding between parent and child. Truly Christian parenting would not require babies to cry."
3,It just wasn't practical for us,"We got this book because some family members had success with it. At the time, we knew nothing of the controversy surrounding it. Later, we were warned against it's use several times. We tried to implement our own loose interpretation of the techniques and ideas, but our baby just didn't fall into any sort of schedule. We couldn't make her take a ""full feeding"" as soon as she woke up, which the book recommends. We coudn't make her go to sleep when she wasn't sleepy. I have come to think that there's a reason we moms have an instinct to care for our babies when they cry. Our daughter is now 6 months old, and regardless of not having a rigid schedule, she is extremely happy and healthy. I have known children who thrived on this system. It just wasn't for us."
1,Baby Wise is Child Abuse,"Don't buy this book, and if someone gave it to you, toss it in the trash.This book has NO scientific (or Biblical) basis, and is furthering a for-profit business run by a failed minister who was censured by his own church, and tells you to ignore every instinct you have about proper parenting. A quick web search for ""BabyWise"" will confirm all of the above.Follow your heart, love your child, and don't let anyone sell you a quick fix baby training solution. The only quick fix is lots of love for your child."
4,Worked for Us,"I first reviewed this book when my baby was 3 months old and had started sleeping through the night at 9 weeks using the prescribed methods. Now at 7 and 1/2 months I'm still a believer. I have a happy, thriving baby who often heaves a sigh of relief when we put him down in his crib to sleep (""Finally!"", I imagine him thinking.)I'm not sure why people get so emotional about this book. As far as I can tell from reviews, the people who have tried the method like it, and the people who gave negative reviews never actually tried it. I must admit I was sceptical when I started it, but it was truly like magic!"
1,Completely unnatural,"This book has so much nonsense it is ridiculous. I read it twice, and was amazed at some of the suggestions. On the cover, it says it is the ""natural way"" to ""train"" your baby to sleep through the night. Almost all of the suggestions go against the nature of you, your baby ,your body, your baby's body, and your instincts. If you find yourself needing direction, find a book that allows you or even encourages you to trust yourself."
1,Listen to your own instincts,Do some research on this book and listen to your own instincts. Any theory or philosophy that has been associated with Failure to Thrive should be closely looked at before being put to use by anyone. My issues with this book have nothing to do with its religious affiliations but rather with the fact that it has and will continue to put infants in danger.
1,If I could give it zero stars I would,This book is horrible. Studies show that the breastfed babywised baby is at risk for failure to thrive. Enough said.
1,Over the Top,"I found this to be written in a very over the top manner, stating things like ""if you want a fussy baby, never let him cry, and hold rock and feed him as soon as he starts to fuss. We guarantee that you will achieve your goal."" (p.131) However, no evidence is offered to back this up. And it doesn't really make sense, because it talks about how your the one in control of the routine, but then it talks about how you need to alter the routine when the baby is hungry, and you will need to adjust your routine to fit the babies needs. So, which is it, is the baby in control or are you? Whatever. Much better info out there that has research behind it, and actually makes sense."
1,this method is cruel!,"By the time my order for this book arrived, my son was already sleeping through the night (at 11 weeks) despite not following ANY of Ezzo's advice. I don't think I could live with myself as a parent if I had let my son cry from the first week as Ezzo suggests. He was very colicky and crying much of the time anyways; funny, that didn't put him to sleep. Ezzo suggests NOT rocking your child to sleep and not letting him fall asleep while eating. He writes that happy contented babies are not born that way but created by following his method. I'm SO GLAD I didn't read this book before I had already learned the kinder, gentler way!"
5,it works,It makes sense and it works. Very practical and do-able. No psycho babble just the truth. definately worth the time to read.
1,"Babywise---It does the job, but so do nuclear weapons!","Babywise is written by a man with no medical training. He purports himself to be a Christian, family specialist. This is not the case. Read what his fellow Christians have to say about him here and why his publisher wanted to disassociate themselves:(...)Yes, Babywise does have some helpful points. The charts are good to keep track of diaper changes, breastfeedings and sleep. But, I will say that from experience, keeping your baby on a strict schedule while unknowingly your milk supply decreases can lead to weight loss and malnutrition. This will lead to far more heartache than a few nights of no sleep with a newborn. Remember that they are only babies once. It is a brief honeymoon in which to enjoy your sweet infant. Don't worry about overscheduling them before their time. The days of school, sports, recreation will have them overbooked soon enough."
1,This might explain Littleton,If you want to know how to create an uncommunicative and violent adolescent read this book. Crying is a babies first attempt at communication. If you ignore it then the baby will learn that communication is pointless.
1,Abusive and Cruel,"The AAP, The World Health Organization, as well as every other reputable pediatrician disagrees with this parenting ""method"". This book is abusive to young babies. A mother has God given instincts to know how to respond to her baby, her entire hormonal system is geared to caretaking her young infant. Her breasts are meant to feed her baby when her BABY NEEDS TO BE FED. This book is NOT condusive to a breastfeeding mother and I guarantee that there is not one person who follows these strict feeding schedules who breastfeeds beyond a year (which is recommended by the AAP). The Ezzo's are NOT DOCTORS, or PARENTING EDUCATORS, and are not educated on the make up of a human being. If you are looking for a convenient way to have a child who falls into a schedule and doesn't bother you too much... GET A DOG!"
1,The Advice in this Book is Dangerous,"Newborn babies do not need to be forced on a schedule. The AAP contradicts the statements in this book. It's misleading. It does not contain accurate information about attachment parenting, feeding infants or attachment in general. A lot of this advice could be potentially damaging, and, in fact it has been shown to contribute to failure to thrive, early weaning, breast milk drying, not to mention attachment issues from allowing a baby to cry it out.There is better advice in other books that can help parents to become more attentive to their children's needs without creating an adversarial realtionship from the very beginning. Newborns need to be fed when they are hungry, held when they need comforted. There will be plenty of time for schedules and routines when the child is older."
1,does this man have a heart?,"the info from this book was horrible. has ezzo spent five days 'round the clock with a newborn? holy cow, babies need to be fed --- when they demnd it -- if you have a heart that is. i wish i never read the book... my little girl failed to gain weight in her first few weeks -- and i think it's because i had ezzo's ""words of wisdom"" in my head. when i told the pediatrician what i was doing, she told me that i really should be feeding my catie when she was crying for it. babies don't know much, but they know what they need and it's every parents job to listen and respond."
1,Garbage,"My title sums up this book perfectly. It's good bathroom reading if you can stay objective, something this books fails to do. Please, just be patient and learn from your baby. Eventually, everyone will sleep and be happy."
1,Don't do it!!!!!!,"I read this book prior to my first baby's birth because it was so highly recommended. I tried hard to follow this method from day one and it was the biggest mistake I've ever made! Two days after bringing my baby home from the hospital, he became very dehydrated and got a fever. We spent a week in the hospital and my poor sweet boy went through hell trying to figure out what was wrong when I now know that he was fricking starving! I wanted to be a good mom and I thought that reading books on methods for baby care was the way to do that. But now I know that the best resources are pediatricians, nurses, and lactation consultants! Do not follow babywise if you want a happy healthy baby! This is not good for babies!"
1,Harmful to your child,"If you want to guarantee developmental issues with your baby, then buy this book. I am a nanny and baby nurse and just spent 3 weeks with a ""baby wise family."" this book went against every parental instinct and caused enormous amounts of stress and anxiety in the home. The schedule was tortuous for everyone involved in the familys's life, especially the baby's. There is no such thing as a cookie cutter baby and this boon tries to create one. It goes against all that is natural and starts the baby on a path to lifelong develolental struggles."
5,Slept through the night at 6 weeks,"My bottle-fed baby has been sleeping from 8pm to 6am since he was six weeks old -- which is when I began following the Baby-Wise plan. His day-time hours are also happier ones. I read Baby Whisperer first, which I also reccommend, but needed some additional details to help me put it together. Of the two, I prefer this one for simplicity of application. I've heard quite a bit of negative press about this book -- but after reading it I can't imagine why. Nothing I read was radical or dangerous. On the contrary, my baby seemed to be crying all the time before I implemented this method and now he is happy all the time, and his weight is in the 98th percentile."
2,Just a harsher Ferberizing,"We know several folks who swore by this method, so we bought the book. I thought it would be a gentler version of the cry-it-out (which we've customized and used with great success), but it's actually tougher. Where Ferber allows you to gradually stretch the time between checking on a crying baby, this guy just wants you to plop the baby in the crib and forget about him. Nap times, too. It would be a reach to believe this is the best approach for baby, but just thinking about it broke my heart-- would have been worse for his."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I read this book probably 10 times between the time I was 8 months pregnant, and my baby was 3 months old. I followed exactly what it said. It's premise is that your baby will be sleeping through the night by 8 weeks of age. My baby is now 13 weeks, and still waking every 2-3 hours. My daughter only naps for 45 min. not for the 1.5-2 hours they talk about. The only thing that my daughter really picked up was to take a full feeding. Otherwise, nothing worked for me. I felt like there were a lot of unanswered questions. Like, what do I do when she sleeps only 45 min? My problem mostly is that it is so matter of fact. If you follow these guidelines, your baby will sleep through the night. It doesn't give any help for when you follow the guidelines, but your baby doesn't."
1,Be wary...,"While this book sets a structure to help parents care for their child...I caution you to understand that most importantly your child's needs come first, not yours. Use this book as a guide but remember to follow your instincts. It is easy to go along with other people's advice when your exhausted and anxious about a new baby. When in doubt, consult your pediatrician.The charts in the back of the book are useful if you are unsure of how to determine if your baby is getting enough to eat."
1,This should be yanked from the shelves,"For information on why you SHOULD NOT so much as use this book for scrap paper please visit: http://www.ezzo.info/. There are infinitely better books out there written by actual pediatricians- actually I can't think of a child rearing book that isn't better than this one. Using the Baby Wise method has been linked to failure to thrive, dehydration and difficulties for breast-feeding mothers. In short, it's dangerous."
1,Not crazy about this book!,"First of all, I dislike Gary Ezzo's tone. He comes across as very sarcastic, arrogant, and condescending if you have a different parenting style.While I liked the sleep/feed/wake cycle, his breastfeeding advice is terrible. 4 feedings 4 times a day, starting at 4 months???? What a joke!!!My advice is to remember that this is one man's opinion and not the end all be all. He has no medical training and certainly no type of training when it comes to lactation issues. Use your common sense and mother's instinct to guide you."
1,Who could live with the strict schedule?,"What adult would want to live with such a strict schedule? Not me! My baby and I have a routine, but I couldn't see putting her on such a rigorous schedule. She eats and sleeps when she wants to, and is starting to sleep thru the night on her own at 3 1/2 months WITHOUT making her ""cry it out"", which I will NOT do. This may have worked for other Mom's...probably working Mom's who don't have the ability to nap during the day to make up for sleepless nights, but for stay at home Mom's like me this doesn't make sense. Let your baby tell you what it needs...forcing a schedule is unnatural. Try a book by Sammons, ""The self-Calmed Baby"". It is VERY insightful and useful without the strict schedule. But it does advocate the ""cry it out"" technique. For an author that does not advocate ""cry it out"", try Dr. William Sears."
1,A Dangerous Book,"The method endorsed by this book has been associated with the hospitalization of babies for severe weight loss. The American Academy of Pediatrics and Focus on the Family, among other respected professionals, have criticized the methods as being both medically and Biblically unsound. Use at your child's risk."
5,its a great book.,helps alot to understand what the baby needs to be able to sleep through the nite. and it breaks down how to teach them to sleep.
2,Heartbreaking,"It sounds great and some people swear by it, but my kid was never a sleeper and I ended up finding that the practices that the book warns against were the only way to keep both the baby and ourselves happy. I think this book makes promises that it doesn't keep...it just won't work magically for everyone, even if you follow the instructions. In fact it is heartbreaking when a book promises a desperate parent a perfect sleeper. I wish I had never followed this book as it made me feel worse. Especially ineffective if you are nursing."
1,This is great if you intend to starve your child of food and comfort.,"The AAP has come out directly and said that for maximum health babies should be fed on demand-period. And as for sleeping? It is absolutely normal for babies to wake up every few hours hungry and needing comfort, in fact it is a good sign. The ideal here is that you adapt to your BABY'S schedule, not the opposite. This book is responsible for many sickly children. Come on parents, don't be simple and lazy, do what is right for your child."
2,"The idea is great, but it's not as easy in practice","I thought the book was interesting, but it did not work well for me. The authors spend 3/4 of the book saying why the method is so wonderful, but do not spend enough time explaining how to get your child to sleep. I found that just putting my daughter down for a nap, as they say to do, did not work. SHe could cry for hours, or until I could not stand it anymore. And then I felt like a failure because I could not get her to sleep without rocking her. THey do not give much help with how you should just get your child to fall asleep on her own, therefore, the book was pointless to me. I would only recommend this book to someone with an easy baby who falls asleep easily. Then the scheduling idea will work wonderfully."
5,Makes Sense,"I don't understand why everyone is so worked up about this book. I used it from day 1. It is logical and very helpful. Use some common sense. You take the general ideas and apply them to you and your baby. No one is talking about hurting a child.You can say whatever you want about this book but the proof is in the pudding. The people that I know that use Baby Wise techniques have kids that sleep. I know several parents that are very proud of not having Baby-Wise kids. After they tell you about the evils of this book, they will complain about all of the sleeping problems they are having.I don't know how you get all the criticism from the logical steps outlined in this book.Abuse? Certainly not"
1,I'd give it a 0 if they had it :-(,"I think the Ezzo book is cruel and unnatural parenting. I would hope anyone with common sense and decency would never treat another human being in this way :-( In my mind, it's criminal!"
1,Scheduled feedings undermine successful breastfeeding!,"This book misses out on the fact that that babies are a privilege, not a convenience. I especially didn't like the fact that there are not only things ""to do"" but things to ""not do"" along with warnings of how you life/marriage/health will suffer if you don't do as you're told (by this book). BAH! Before there was a clock on every wall, babies were breastfed when they were hungry and the human race did extremely well with that *system*."
1,Babies aren't dogs to be trained.,"I found this book scary. Ezzo spouts dangerous advice as though it were fact, and has no references to back up these statements. If feeding on a schedule is better for babies, why does every other baby care and breastfeeding guide recommend feeding on demand for the first few weeks, to establish a milk supply? ""Metabolic Chaos""? This is a term he apparently invented and is not mentioned in any other baby care or medical text I have ever seen. I guess Ezzo knows something the American Academy of Pediatrics doesn't. Having a baby is not always convenient. But babies are not dogs to be trained to eat and sleep on our schedules. I think this Ezzo guy should write a book on dog-training instead."
1,Do your own research before buying this book!,I am totally against this book but don't just take my word for it. Do your own research before even considering buying this book. You will be amazed at what you find. I knew after reading it that I would never be a Babywise mother. The principles in this book go against every natural maternal instinct in my body. I started researching and I found numerous sources that told me my instincts were right. Very reliable sources! This book is dangerous to children.
1,Before you buy Babywise,"Although you'd hardly know it from reading the reviews or thebook itself, Babywise remains very controversial. .................It is important that you understand the context in which this book was written. The premise and arguments are very seductive; they can even convince you that you are remiss as a parent if you don't implement the Babywise ""infant management system"". They are, in fact, mostly the parenting philosophies if the author and the science cited to support many of his claims has been called into question. Do your baby a favor and get the facts behind this book before you give in to it's promise."
1,Evil - Stay away,"These writes know nothing about bringing up loving and healthy childern. My mother in-law bought us the book for our first child. My wife was in tears when she started to read the book and I made her put it away. We did about everything the book said not to do. Just recently we found the book again while searching boxes for things for our 2nd child. We laughed as we read though the index again. This time we sent it to the trash rather than resell it on Amazon.These writers are just evil people trying to push some fundamentalist agenda. Our older child has grown up loving, confident, and smart. We followed our hearts and brains and made the choices we felt were best. Child caring is not an easy task and there will be many a sleepless night. If you want your child to be a confident and productive part of socity, stay as far away from this as possile. Beside two men writing a book on how to raise your child. No that's funny."
4,Badly organized but PHENOMENAL information,"Don't read this book while you're tired or you'll probably mess up the ""system"" as we did, causing our newborn some unneccessary stress (poor kid!) while we figured out what the book was really saying. It's really badly organized, so things that seem like hard and fast rules in the beginning are contradicted towards the middle, and restated at the end. HOWEVER with a bit of your own good judgement it is fantastic advice. Our son was sleeping through the night (I'm talking 8-9 hours!!) at 2 months!! By three months it was CONSISTENT. And without a single whimper at bedtime (unless he spat up on himself, or some other baby madness) Middle of night feedings in the beginning, same thing. After eating, the kid went right back down for more snoozing. And during the day, a cheerful, chipper little dude. Maybe we just got a perfect kid, but my guess is it's the book. We started at birth, having had friends recommend it, and we swear by it."
1,Never Judge a book by its cover? Warning!!!,"Wow, I am a first time dad and someone recommended this to me the other day. I research everything, and glad I did. The author is nothing more than an evangelist and on top of that, it is linked to alot of health problems. Read and learn----http[...] or just Google BABYWISE. I think the American Academy of Pediatrics might know just a tad bit more than Gary Ezzo. This is not something for my baby.Here is another link. It is your child. Check it out.[...]Good luck!!"
1,DO YOUR Research,"Hundreds of people have jumped onto the Atkins diet or this fad or that... and it has worked for some- does this make it good principle. Who wouldn't want their baby to sleep through the night? But wait, who said sleeping through the night was normal infant behavior?The author has a sketchy past, but lets look past that. The methods described in the book are built on shaky principles & assumptions. Do a google search and see what comes up. The generalisms in the book are valuable but there are a multitude of other books with less seeds to spit out of the watermelon."
1,Putting Baby at Risk for Health Issues,"I was given this book as a gift at my baby shower. I read it, but my instinct was telling me that I shouldn't follow it. Both my daughter's Pediatrician and the newborn care class, which I took while pregnant, advised that we NOT use the methods taught in this book. When using these methods, you run the risk of having a baby who ultimately fails to thrive.Now that my daughter is a healthy, happy one-year-old, I am SO glad that I did not take the advice of this book and instead followed my heart. A six, seven, or eight-week-old breastfed newborn is NOT supposed to sleep through the night without waking to nurse. Some babies may do this on their own, but no infant should be conditioned to do so before they are ready. In my opinion, there are many books available that are much better for everyone involved, including baby!"
1,Watch out,"Before buying this book, please read more about areas of serious concern at www.ezzo.info. There are safer ways to get baby to sleep through the night and develop a daytime schedule."
1,"Not for us, maybe for you","When it comes to parenting, it is absolutely dependent upon the parents, their philosophies and the temperament of the baby. In other words, everyone is different in how they decide to parent.This book, this plan and this philosophy is not for us or our baby.It is too structured and too scheduled. If you are looking for a schedule, this is your book.If you're not, try ""Sleeping through the Night"" by Jodi Mindell. Much gentler approach."
3,Not as great as expected,"A friend raved about this book but we found it to be somewhat useful. Its a short book so I recommend if you are interested, to get it before your baby is born. We got it a few months after our son was born and the advice is hard to make sense if you are not following the suggestions from an early age. A lot of the book focuses on feeding habits and suggesting that neither a completely demand based approach or time based approach work in feeding your baby. They call it parent directed feeding. PDF made sense to us and I think it sets a good pattern of feeding so its useful for new mothers as well. Our son is not our first so if you are looking for something focusing on curing a child that won't sleep through the night, this may not be your perfect book. If you started with them from week 1, it may be another story but its hard to get on program when you are a few months in since you have no record of your prior child's patterns."
1,Babies are not animals,"This kind of ""baby training"" makes me sick. Babies are PEOPLE, not animals who need to be trained like dogs. They know when they're hungry, they know when they're tired, and they know when they need to be comforted. A sweet little baby spends 9 months nestled inside the warmth of his mother's body. We shouldn't expect a baby to come straight out of the womb and immediately adjust to sleeping in a cold, hard crib away from his mama. When a baby is ""crying it out,"" the only thing she is learning is that she has to depend on herself for comfort because she can't trust anyone to come help her.People who are considering buying this book should do themselves a big favor and buy some Alfie Kohn books instead. Search ""attachment parenting"" here on Amazon, and you'll find some worthwhile reading material that will benefit you AND your baby."
1,Dangerous Practices and Uncredentialed Author,"This book goes against all natural principles that our babies are born with and we as parents know instinctively:Each baby is unique and has his/her own needs-- timing of eating, sleeping, and activity, as well as nutritional requirements. You cannot treat all babies the same!Be Smart-- not ""Wise"" use your brain and your parental instincts to care for your baby's needs.Don't listen to a fast talking guy who has branded himself a guru (with no legitimite support)Do a google search on Gary Ezzo and you'll find quite a few disturbing results. The American Academy of Pediatrics has a strong position against this practice, along with other well-respected groups such as La Leche League, and others. It puts babies at risk of malnutrition - they will eventually comply to the schedule you put them on, but they may not get the nutrition they need; plus there is an associated risk of baby depression when their immediate needs are not met."
1,BOO!,This book goes against everything mothering instinct I have. Letting a baby cry without tending to their needs?!I'd also be hesitant to take parenting advice from an author who has no relationship with his children today.
2,"Some good advice, but don't take it to heart","I thought the advice in this book was helpful and I followed it faithfully because I was so desperate to get my son to sleep through the night. It didn't work. My son just doesn't sleep through the night. The attitude of the book made me feel inadequate as a parent because he wasn't sleeping through the night. In talking with other ""real"" parents, I realized I wasn't alone and they built back my confidence in my parenting.I do like the parent-directed feeding philosophy. It is a nice middle ground between feeding on demand (which becomes tiresome) and by the clock (making for a cranky baby). Parent-directed feeding uses that mommy sixth sense and flexibility, and that advice has worked well.My advice is to take advice, whether it be from books or people, and make it your own. Don't let any source of advice dictate your confidence in parenting. Each kid is different, so you would need an individualized book for each kid ever born."
1,Cold Tone,"I was sorry I bought this book. I feel the overall tone is cold and it makes you feel like you are doing something wrong if your baby doesn't sleep through the night. I have had my baby on a flexible 3 hour feeding and play/sleep schedule similar to what is recommended by this book since she was born (as recommended by The Baby Whisperer which I highly recommend. She goes to sleep easily but was waking up - BECAUSE SHE WAS HUNGRY, GROWING BABIES NEED FOOD. Now at 3 months her belly is big enough to help her sleep longer not because of any scheduling I forced her into. However, from reading this book you'd think I was doing something wrong....On Becoming Baby Wise: Giving Your Infant the Gift of Nighttime Sleep (On Becoming. . .)"
1,Wow.,"Jesse Ventura was right when he said that organized religion was for weak-minded people. Anyone who advocates hitting a child should be arrested for abuse. My husband was hit as a child, and he has had to deal with all sorts of issues as an adult, such as physical abuse towards me, etc. Now that he's on Prozac, he swears his mother co-authored this book! Just bizarre. I shudder to think about these babies when they get to be adults. This book should be listed under the comedy section."
4,READ THE BOOK,"This book does not advocate rigid scheduling. They do outline healthy growth signals. They oppose answering a baby's cry anytime with a boob. Would you like to have a diaper full of poop and then have a boob stuck in YOUR mouth? They only problem is that it's so short that it doesn't give enough examples. (Hence, 4 starts) Follow up with Secrets of the Baby Whisperer. Surprise! - The exact same advice, but with a British accent. Good luck!"
1,This is one scary book,"My son was a patient of (co-author) Dr. Bucknam's when he was born (1994). I was given the earlier version of 'Babywise' by Dr. Bucknam while I was in the hospital. I read the book and followed the suggestions to the letter, as a result, I discontinued breastfeeding my son when he was 6 weeks old. At his two-week checkup, he still hadn't re-gained his birthweight, which should have been my first clue that something was amiss."
2,Dangerous if followed too strictly.,"I just spent two days with a family that is strictly implementing this program with their newborn. It was completely heartbreaking. The baby spent hours alone in her crib every day, crying while the parents went about their day seeming completely undisturbed and detached. They never even went in to check on her until it was time to feed again. I'm convinced the only reason she ever slept was from exhaustion. I've read the book myself and think it has some good ideas if followed with flexibility, but can't imagine having used it so strictly with a newborn. Please consult your pediatrician or lactation consultant before buying into this method 100%."
1,"Babywise advice linked to dehydration, failure to thrive","If you want to get this book, please do a thorough amount of research. My God child is 9 months old and only 14 lbs because his parents followed this book. They did not do it to extremes, it is just not good advice. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that infants should not be put on schedules. Some children may be fine, but others are put at risk for dehydration, malnutrition, and a general failure to thrive. I recommend reading -Caring for Your Baby and Young Child (The AAP published book). My 3 month old daughter is doing wonderfully."
1,Do your research!,"Type in the words ""failure to thrive Babywise"" into google and see what comes up! He was dropped by his publisher AND church! They feared the lawsuits that would come from this dangerous approach to feeding/caring for your child. The American Association of Pediatrics has sent out warning to pediatricians about this dangerous and sickening trend.DO YOUR RESEARCH! This approach is NOT biblical........it is likened to a cult."
4,Babywise,"We are thankful for this book. After 2 weeks of erratic sleep/eat/wake schedules with our twins we needed help. Within 2 days of following the priniciples explained in this book our girls were on a schedule that worked for all of us. One of our daughters was sleeping through the night by 9 weeks, the other by 10 weeks. We never abused or neglected them. They were fed when they were hungry. In fact, they seemed to accept this as a natural rhythm. As rested parents, we made better parents and partners. This is not a rigid program but rather a guide that makes good sense. There is nothing in this book that instructs parents not to love, cuddle and nurture their children!Our daughters are five months old now and have learned good sleep patterns. They are put down awake and happy and are able to lull themselves to sleep ."
1,Felt unnatural,"The pressure I felt from my husband as a mom of a two week old to follow through with this book was terrible. I went to a mom's group and learned that it's not really supported in the medical community. Good thing! All my instincts told me it was wrong, and I was happy I had some scientific research to back up my feelings with my husband. Looking back, he laughs at his demanding a baby live to his schedule now."
1,Just plain BAD parenting advice!!!,This method is NOTHING NEW and dont use it !!!!My daughters are adults now and I raised them on the demand method. I met their every request and need when they were newborns. I would NEVER let them cry. They are successful loving children. My MIL used the babywise method 69 years ago and my husband is the most insecure and jealous person I have ever met. I attribute this to not having his needs met as a baby. My MIL was strict and only fed him every four hours..I can only imagine he cried alot!!!!! As an adult he is rather self centered now. You have a child now please take care of it.
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars,Newborn babies do not need a schedule...they need to be loved and nutured...this means feeding him or her when they are hungry..not when it is convenient for the parents.Save your money and follow your instincts instead.
4,An excellent guide,"I read this book several years ago when a friend recommended it to me when I had my first child. I have 3 boys now--6, 4, and 7 months, and this book was great for all of them. All my boys slept through the night at least by 12 weeks (for the first one, then 10 weeks for the 2nd child, 8 weeks for the 3rd). I agree that you cannot apply the methods rigidly--you need to be flexible. The most important lesson in this book is not necessarily the sleeping/feeding cycle (although that is very important). The key is understanding that your child is not the CENTER of the universe--he or she needs to become a part of your family. If you raise your children keeping that principle in mind, and maintain a normal feeding/sleeping schedule with your children, you will have happy and healthy children. And you and your spouse will be able to have quiet time in the evening and sleep through the night. All 3 of my kids go to bed at 8:00 and don't wake until 6:30 a.m."
1,A selfish mode of parenting,"Please adopt a selfless attitude with your child, especially when they are an infant. I shudder at the suggestions in this book. Your instincts will tell you that this is a selfish way of parenting, by forcing your child into your schedule.Kelly TownsendAuthorChrist Centered Childbirth"
1,Read 'The Baby Book' By Dr. Sears instead,The advice in this book is counter recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and can lead to problems like failure to thrive.
2,Read this and BALANCE the information with other advice!,"I thought that I would follow the advice in this book completely. However, when my baby was born, I realized that while there are some good points in the book, I needed other perspectives on parenting to BALANCE the approach they give in the Babywise books. Anyone who reads these books should read the information at ...... This website gives alot of background information that is extremely useful when deciding which advice to follow from the book. I DO think that this book gave me good principles to think about, but it is VERY important to consider your own gut feeling as a parent too. I must say that by being generally consistent with feeding and nap times, my daughter goes down for naps and bedtime with NO crying. Hope these thoughts helped someone in considering this book."
1,BabyWise is ANYTHING BUT WISE!!!,"I read BabyWise as a reccomendation from a friend's friend. After reading one chapter I knew I would not agree with a fraction of what the book sais, but I read on anyway. All I can say is: YUCK! What a heartless way to raise an infant. Try Dr. Sears' Baby Book."
5,The book is amazing!!,"I used this book years ago with my first two kids. Nine years later, when I found out we were having another baby, one of the first things I did was repurchase this book and read it cover to cover. My third child is now two months old and has been sleeping through the night for a month! I would say after having luck with all three of my children, who have very different sleep needs, it's worth a try. Anyone interested in helping your baby get on a schedule and having a full night of sleep, should give this book an honest effort and do exactly what the book says to do. Also, buy the book for anyone who may be helping you with childcare so they can understand how to work with you as a team. It's a very short easy read."
4,This works for Breastfeeding also,"... I will say 2 children later (one is 2 and the other is 6 months now with clean bills of health from our pediatrician) that this is not a true statement. Both my sons were breastfed and we did not have a failure to thrive issue or dehydration. In fact, both of them are well within height and weight norms. I think where people are having problems is that they don't realize that you have to do your job and observe the cues that the baby is receiving enough milk (esp number of dirty diapers). This book was a common sense approach to feeding babies and making life good for the whole family. I took one star off because the book is not always organized well and it does not address certain types of concerns thoroughly (such as colick situations). But I would whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone and tell them to read carefully and follow through and your baby, your spouse, and you will have a great time growing together!!"
5,THE book for intelligent parents.,"This book is great. My daughter started sleeping through the night at 4 weeks and is a breeze to put down for naps and bedtime. In addition, she wakes up with a big smile and is happy throughout the day.There are a lot of negative reviews out there and while I understand the concern, unless you've tried it you can't know. This book stresses over and over again that the suggestions are guidelines for parents - not hard and fast rules. This book shows parents how to parent intelligently, with full faculties, not just emotion. It very much says that parents should respond to crying, but with the right kind of response. Crying is the only form of communication babies have and it is up to the parents to interpret what they are. If a child spoke: ""I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm wet, I""m scared, I'm bored"" you wouldn't automatically feed them! You would do the appropriate response, which may be feeding..."
1,Baby in a Box?,"Maybe your baby fits in the ""Ezzo box"". Chances are s/he doesn't! I see some of the rave reviews from parents who claim those who criticize this program must not have read the book. I have.I can't help but think there must be a reason that there is so much material to refute the ""guidelines"" Rev. Ezzo offers. AND there must be a reason why Lactation Consultants are severely warned to recognize the poor patterns present with ""Ezzo-led parenting"".You were given your child to raise. Not Gary Ezzo.Just food for thought."
1,HORRENDOUS BOOK,"This book should be burned. I almost had a nervous breakdown trying to follow his system. Ezzi is someone who just wanted to be a famous author, his so called philosopy of keeping a baby awake so it will sleep the night is bunk and torture for the baby. My baby sleeps the night at 8 days old, once fed. Ezzi is a JERK!"
1,How not to nurse your baby.,"Most parents who adhear to Mr Ezzo's phylosophy have insufficient milk supply. Infants need to be fed when they are hungry, they are not trying to manipulate their parents.Breastmilk itself is digested in about 90 min.That is why they need to eat more frequently than that author thinks they should.He has caused many new mother's to feel inadiquate, because they don't think they can supply enough milk for thier baby, not realizing that it is not them, but this man's method of parenting."
5,It Work's and what's up with the negativity,"Never have I seen such negativity expressed for a book. What's up with that? We have used the tenets expressed in this book with unqualified success. It works; infants seem to thrive on the schedule - emotionally, physically and sleep-wise. We also were rewarded with a happy child in part from the book and the temperament of the child... Nature or Nurture - both play a role.PDF is the right choice and I find very upsetting people are being told many untrue things about this book. Please read it and try the techniques - you and your child will be rewarded with full sleep cycles and content kids. What's up with these folks that are NOT setting schedules for their children - children need us to set the timetables, they thrive on structure and not the chaos of CDF."
1,Ezzo also advocates CORPORAL PUNISHMENT for toddlers,"Read it for yourself at http://www.nospank.net/granju2.htmA true eye opener, more valuable than hearsay. You owe it to yourself as a parent and more importantly you owe it your baby. Be wise, be knowledgeable and never ignore your maternal & fraternal instincts - EVER"
5,It really works!,This book is awesome. My son started sleeping through the night at 10 weeks and the process was easy to follow. I have several friends who have used the Baby Wise method and have had the same success.
5,hard to implement...but it works if you stick with it,"I don't care what anyone says in their review...the simple truth is, if you stick to it, it works! I have two kids. The first baby was survival mode..We had no method (and it WAS madness). We listened to what advice we got from other people, but for the most part, we just took it one day at a time, and did what we could for our daughter. We used food as a cry blocking method, because we didn't know better. She cried all the time (or at least it felt like it). She slept through the night by 7 months, and that was with formula. Our second baby we read baby wise, and were determined to follow it. It was not easy to implement at all! It takes time and effort. But he started sleeping through the night at the end of his 8th week. And he is successfully breastfed. IT IS WORTH IT!"
1,THE AAP HAS ISSUED A WARNING ABOUT THIS BOOK,"The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a warning about the advice given in this book:""One such book, On Becoming Babywise, has raised concern among pediatricians because it outlines an infant feeding program that has been associated with failure to thrive (FTT), poor milk supply failure, and involuntary early weaning.""<...>The ""advice"" in this book could kill your child. Please speak with your child's pediatrician regarding appropriate feeding and sleep schedules for your child's age."
1,Garbage Don't Waste Your Money,Worthless junk. Everyone knows infants are not trying to manipulate their parents. This book was obviously written by a man who knows nothing about children.
2,advice advice advice,"I heard a lot of positive feedback on this book, which is why I purchased it. But it only caused me to feel very uneasy when put into practice. Women were made to know more than they even realize they do. We are built to take care of our babies, and our Creator is the One who we should listen to. Books like this have only cause anxiety for me, so if you're anything like me, and you are desperate for advice and ""how to do this""- I would say the best thing you can do is to talk to someone you trust and who has raised GOOD kids (not raised a bunch of awful kids). They seem to follow the best method- follow your heart, pray."
1,"Getting wise to ""babywise""","Read this article by Katie Allison Granju on the growing concerns over the Babywise advice and why concerned medical, lactation science and child development experts are speaking out against the book.http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/1998/08/cov_06feature.html"
5,A needed book for getting sleep!,"I highly recommend this book. I wish I would have started implementing its suggestions from the day my son was born, but I didn't until he was about 2 1/2 months old. He was fighting sleep every time he needed to go to bed and we had a long list of things we had to do in order to get him to sleep. Once we got him to sleep we were then lucky if he'd stay that way. After a few hard nights of implementing the Babywise advice, he goes right down for naps and bed. No fighting at all! There is also now predictability to our days which helps us to be more pleasant parents. We aren't constantly frustrated and sleep-deprived ourselves! For the first time I feel like we did something to make a positive impact on his life instead of just being props to get him to sleep. It was difficult...have no illusions about that, but it was well worth it!"
1,talk to your doctor first!,"Christianity Today, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr Jay Gordon and many others havedenouced this book and the authors methods as being dangerous. Babies who are breastfedon the scheduele included in the book, have suffered dehydration, failure to thrive, and severecomplications. Parents using this method have been convicted of child abuse!Please do not buy this book. Try The Baby book by Dr. Sears or You Baby and child byPenelope Leach instead."
2,a 1-idea book,"I'll save you the money of the book by telling you its basic premise; it's really a one-(two?-)idea book. The authors believe that the main trick to getting your baby to sleep well at night is to put them on a feeding schedule.While I wholeheartedly endorse that schedule= predictability= sanity for mother, my baby has always been on a schedule and, at 10 months, still doesn't sleep through the night.The secondary idea is that you should not feed/nurse your child to sleep. Rather, feed your child, engage in an activity with your child, and then put them to sleep while they are still awake. I also did this.Maybe my child is an anomaly."
1,Misleading and dangerous!,"This book can cause harm to your baby! The author of this book has no degree in child development or pediatric medicine, and I think it is obvious when you read his ideas and recommendations. There have been reports by pediatricians around the country who have seen babies suffering from malnutrition as a result of following this book's technique for getting a baby on a feeding schedule. In fact, parents have been accused of child neglect for using Ezzo's methods. Many of his statements are unfounded and some have been proven absolutely false."
1,Horrible book!,"This book has been condemned by the American Academy of Pediatrics because babies parented using Ezzo's methods have been categorized as ""Failure to thrive"". Reports find that babies parented this way are likley yo be underweight and depressed. His methods are sabotage to a healthy breastfeeding relationship.He breaks down the intuitive and natural child/parent bond by forcing infants into an adult structure...."
3,feed-wake-sleep feeding,"I found the tone of this book very affirming and balanced. I'm really not sure what all the fuss is about. Unless I missed something Baby Wise does not advocate rigid scheduled feedings, they simply say that you should follow a feed-wake-sleep feeding schedule instead of a feed-sleep-wake one so the child does not associate feeding with sleeping.In the end, you as a parent need to trust your own instincts and do what is right for your child. Don't let this book or any others (especially the fanatical book by Dr Sears) make you go against your conscience. If this book is applied reasonably and intelligently it could be helpful. We have decided to do an ""on demand"" feeding and just try to time the feedings so that Jr. gets his last feeding late at night (usually midnight) so he slept naturally for 6-7 hours at 2 months. YMMV."
1,"Ridiculous advice, especially if you have multiples","I have an idea. Let's stagger feedings for our multiples. Why didn't I think of this sooner? Right when Baby A is finished eating, Baby B wakes up. What perfect timing they have. And if Baby B wakes early, I'll just patiently explain to him or her that it is not his or her time to feed, so please wait until Baby A is finished. At which time, Baby B will patiently and quietly wait. Oh, and Baby A will finish eating and wait patiently -- not spitting up or having any other issues -- while Baby B is feeding.Yeah, right! This book is a joke when giving advice for parents of multiples. You cannot force twins or triplets into a staggered feeding pattern. If it naturally happens for you, that's great. But many times both are awake at the same time and both are hungry. The author obviously never spent a day with twins. I would not recommend this book to parents of multiples. The advice is not even close to realistic; it's actually almost comical."
1,Hitting an 8-month-old baby is NOT wise discipline!,"Why would anyone belive that swatting an 8-month-old baby is God's will? If God were standing in my kitchen I sincerely doubt he would recommend that I hit my babies. Discipline them, yes. Teach them, yes. Guide them, yes. I worry about the children whose frustrated, misguided parents would resort to these methods. Even James Dobson has called the program ""too rigid"". The American Academy of Pediatrics is concerned enough to be evaluating the impact of this book. There are many, many good books on discipline - please - for the sake of your children - pick another book."
1,"Ezzo is a fraud, according to Christianity Today","Ezzo's book is filled with unsubstantiated nonsense that seems popular only because he offers easy solutions to the difficult task of raising a baby. Moreover, he is unqualified, and his credentials are suspect. His integrity is so much in question that he was removed from a position of power within his own church. He does not have the degrees that he claims to possess. Frankly, I am stunned that Amazon is still selling this book, considering that the publisher has apologized for printing it. For those who question my position, please refer to a recent article in CHRISTIANITY TODAY that reveals this information."
1,"Crush Your Child's Spirit...and possibly make her really sick, too!","Beware. This one-sized fits all, disciplinarian approach to caring for infants is highly controversial, and for good reason. While it works for some babies, a substantial number of cases suggest others will be put at great risk for Failure To Thrive and poor mother/child bonding. Don't take my word for it--I'm not an expert (then again, neither is Gary Ezzo)--but if your child's physical and emotional well-being is important to you, please please please spend the few minutes it will take to do a google search to see what the real experts have to say about these methods, and read the readily available horror stories of parents for whom this method went terribly wrong."
1,Very Simple,"Can you give zero stars, this book should recalled because it threatens the lives of children. I am not going to go on and on because it is really very simple. These methods have been associated babies DYING, is that the parenting book you were looking for. I have read this and it terrifies me, I feel sick to my stomach thinking about this. Please try The Baby Book by Sears."
1,I only give it one star because zero was not an option,"I have never read anything so horrible in my life. It is all about convenience and ease for the parent. I'm shocked at how medically inaccurate it is and what a ridiculous characterization of attachment parenting Gary Ezzo portrays. It was a gift, one that I detest so fully that a landfill is too generous a resting place for it."
1,There is an alternative,"If you are looking for an alternative parenting style, I recommend a wonderful new book called 'ATTACHMENT PARENTING:Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child' by Katie Allison Granju. You owe it to yourself and your baby to compare these two approaches to infant care before you try Gary Ezzo's controversial recommendations."
2,"Poorly crafted, so-so contents","This book desperately needs and editor to cut through the self-serving nonsense, illogical arguments, and odd, out-of-place rants against 'attachment parenting'. And needs just as badly a proofreader who can fix the many typos and errors throughout. It all distracts and detracts from the main message, and makes the book seem as if it was written by a bunch of kooks. It's just shoddy.As for the actual content, I'm not a fan of the methodology presented, and prefer science-based approaches with quantifiable results that foster a baby's developmental growth rather than this this presentation of invented anecodotes."
1,"Gave it 1 star, but it desreves ZERO!","This book and the theories behind it are doing more harm than good to so many babies. This book recommends feeding your child at a set schedule, and not giving into their demands. This approach IS NOT, I repeat, IS NOT, supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics. They say it can be harmful, as a matter fact. Taking this approach to breastfeeding may not only lead to dehydration and malnutrition in your newborn, but may also lead to a decreased and ultimately an early loss of the mother's milk supply. Since the AAP guidelines suggest one year, and the World Health Organization suggests three years of breastfeeding, why would any mother want to take the route that would keep her from attaining those goals? As the leader of a breastfeeding support group, I can tell you that this program scares the hell out of me. Our children deserve better. This program is any thing but Babywise- it's just plain stupid."
3,Meh,"An okay book. Advises trying to set up a routine sleep/wake schedule, but offers no real advice on how to do it or how to actually get your baby to fall asleep. Which is the main point of getting the book. I wouldn't _need_ a book if I already knew how to convince him to go to sleep on his own."
2,Board certified physician's review,"As a board certified internist and new mother, I was very interested in getting my full term baby to sleep through the night. Like any book, you need to take away what is of value. I believe in the eat, wake, sleep cycle, but the 3-4 hour feeding cycles can be too short for breast fed babies. Breast milk is digested more quickly than formula and babies have very small stomaches which may not store enough nutrition to last for 3-4 hours. My baby ate every 2-2.5 hours and nursed for 1-1.5 hours at a time. On this schedule, he slept through the night beginning at 5 weeks. I had initially tried to lengthen his feedings out to 3 hours as recommended by Baby Wise, but soon realized that he was hungry before the 3 hour mark. Following the 3-4 hour cycle recommendation can be dangerous to some newborns. If your baby fits the 3-4 hours cycle, great. If not, follow your parenting instincts and feed your baby if you think he's hungry."
1,Abusing Children is Not Christian Parenting,"This book is truly apalling. The so-called Christian methods of the Ezzos have been condemned by the American Academy of Pediatrics (a very conservative organization) because so many infants whose parents have followed the advice in this book have had to be treated for failure to thrive (read: starving). The Ezzos have no training at all in nutrition or in the mechanics of breastfeeding yet insist in promoting a rigid feeding schedule which causes breastfed babies to starve, promoting the idea that most modern mothers sadly ""can't"" breastfeed. I am not even going to go into their ridiculous ideas about how infants are spoiled if you hold them and attend to them or about how they advocate striking babies. Please avoid this book if you care about your child's health. God does not condone child abuse."
1,Systematized child abuse.,"The Ezzo philosophy is a sure-fire way to ruin your sanity (from listening to your child's constant crying), to your milk supply (from not nursing frequently enough), to your child's health (from dehydration, lack of nutrition, and inability to attach emotionally).Why destroy your relationship with your child? Because a huge for-profit conglomerate that has been publicly discredited by every major Christian church tells you to?If you want to hurt your child terribly, every day, and torture them slowly, go for the advice in this book.If you actually care about your child, go read a parenting manual."
5,Worked for us!,"The concepts in Babywise are wonderful and worked so well for my daughter and I. The book was recommended to me by multiple people in my church, so as a first time mom, I got the book and read it while pregnant. At 6 weeks my daughter consistently goes to bed between 8pm to 9pm at night, sleeps for 6 to 8 hours, wakes up for a feeding and goes right back to sleep for another 3 hours. Obviously the principles in this book will not work for every baby. However, it has worked incredibly well for us; I love it and the flexibility it gives us. I also have a very happy, well developing baby."
1,babywise,"Skip this one and buy the Ferber book on sleep, instead. It still gives firm encouragement, but with a gentler tone. I used the Ferber book with great results. My son was sleeping through the night at 8 weeks. Now he is 12 months and does not have the ""mommyitis"" my Babywise friends' children have. I truly believe that they were allowed to spend so much time screaming (per Babywise) that they think if mom leaves the room, she is never coming back. I just ordered the Ferber book as a new baby gift here on Amazon."
5,Thank goodness for this book!,This book should be a best seller. My husband and I read and followed this book closely with our first baby and he is extremely happy and healthy. Everyone who meets him can't believe how happy he is and what a great dispostion he has! A number of co-workers and friends have also followed the babywise prinicals with similar sterling results! Thank you Mr. Ezzo!
5,More than sleeping through the night,"When I was pregnant, we focused so much on the pregnancy, that it didn't occur to us to decide what kind of parenting philosophy to adpot. This book helped us to define and refine the kind of parents we wanted to be. ONE of the beneifts of this book is sleeping through the night (for you AND baby), but it is much more than that. This book helps you keep a clear head about parenting and what is really best for your child. It will even help you in the first stages of discipline. If you like this book, look for the follow-up books for older children. I now give this as a ""pregnancy gift"" to all my girlfriends."
1,Dangerous Mis-information,"This book is full of dangerous mis-information. Ezzo is afundamentalist minister--NOT a parenting expert. REAL experts like,Dr. Berry Brazelton, Penelope Leach, Dr. William Sears, and Jeanne Elium have all expressed distaste with Ezzo's methods. Buy their books NOT this one!"
1,babywise,I cant believe you are selling this book on Amazon. Really??? It is dangerous to the health and well being of children Written by a pair of religious nuts!
1,I'm sure glad my parents didn't have this book!,"What an awful concept of child-rearing. What are this authors credintials, anyway? Yes, children may grow and sleep like clockwork on this ""program"", and their parents may blissfully sleep thru the night, since their babies know that their cries are not worth responding to. But what about babies emotional needs? They are human, you know- the most fragile, vulnerable of all humans and in desperate need of the physical conact and responsiveness of other humans-namely their parents. If you want something to ""train"" and to fit very conveniently into your lifestyle, get a dog. No, that might require too much effort- get a lizard. And people wonder why so many people in this country are emotional wrecks and lonely-- the foundations are laid in infancy with books like these. Don't buy it-be a real parent and follow your instincts, [...]"
1,this book deserves 0 stars,"This is the most horrible book I have ever read. It amounts to child abuse. Our daughter woke up nightly for nearly 2 1/2 yrs, yet we were never sleep deprived. Instead we used the night as a time to meet her needs for closeness and nurturing. If you don't want to parent your child, don't have one."
4,Good info,"My baby girl is 7 weeks and I'm still referencing this book. I don't really think BW is the one and only way to deal with an infant, but I do think there are great chunks of information that is valuable to any new parent. If u choose to read this book definitely keep an open mind and maybe even try it for a while...there are some very helpful tips in this book."
1,Not a PRO-BABY Book...STEER CLEAR,"This book is not written with the baby in mind. It is not pro-baby. There are a few good points but the irresponsible bad points out weigh those. One of my friends took this literally and her baby did not thrive and in fact was loosing weight. She and her husband disagreed with the book but she thought it was going to work for her...it did not and when she finally realized the books schedule was creating more problems than anything she stopped following the ""principles""...if you call them that. Please do your research and read the single star reviews too. There is a reason so many people have come out against this philosophy of parenting."
3,Baby whisperer is better,"Although this book was a life-saver with our second baby, it always came across as being kind of harsh. Sometimes I felt guilty when I just 'couldn't get it'. Then I bought ""Secrets of a Baby Whisperer"" when our fourth baby was born, and it was like a warm blanket was thrown over me, and as I learned to understand and comfort my baby, I was comforted too. Now I understand my baby better, while still keeping the whole family happy, and still having a healthy routine."
1,Is there something less than 1 star?,"What a horrible model for raising a child. If you want easy and convenient, get a pet rock. Babies are for loving and nurturing, not scheduling and ignoring."
1,One of Satan's largest acomplishments,"A sickening, disgusting book that is helping to destroy this country. Satan works extra hard in hospitals and anywhere a newborn is, since they are the foundation of God's people. The latest media alert by the American Academy of Pediatrics says it all: A strong correlation with this book has been documented in Babies who have failure to thrive and dehydration."
1,Dangerous Advice,"I find it sad that parents are still unaware of the dangers of Babywise. Beware! This book is not medically supported, and goes against the recommendations of the AAP. Furthermore, it has been associated with dehydration and failure to thrive. It should go against any parent's instincts. Putting your needs ahead of a newborn? Make a newborn wait to eat? Allow a newborn to cry so that they can be on schedule? Babies are meant to be nourished, and their needs should be met when they cry not when parents feel like it!!! I'm confused why anyone would actually take this book seriously!"
4,Proactive Parenting,"First, I do agree with another reviewer ... this book is not for everyone.Yet, I do believe that this book will help you lay the foundation to good parenting strategies without telling you specifically how to acheive the results. That is up to your judgement. I now have a 2 year old and a baby on the way. It is easy to become frustrated/angry at situtations that occur (especially in 'toddler-hood'). I found that these books can help offer perspective on a way to control the situation before it ever gets out of hand .... and before you get out of control. I have bought the first 2 books and will definitely buy the next one as well."
3,loved it,"This book saved my life. With so much information out there I was very confused about how to handle my newborn when it came to a breastfeeding and sleeping routine. Not being a fan of the ""On Demand Method"", this book gave me some great direction on setting up a schedule that worked for both me and my newborn and we couldn't be happier. I would and do recommend it to all new moms."
1,Actually NO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,PLEASE get this dangerous book off your bookshelves. There is no wisdom in this book. This method is harmful and there is a great deal of science and experience to prove it.
2,Sleeping through the night,"This book was definitely not for us. We tried it for about a month and just about went crazy. The recommendations were too difficult to follow. (Have you ever tried keeping a very young baby up?)On the other hand, ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Children"" by Marc Weissbluth has worked wonderfully for us. Granted, our baby is no doubt very easy, but under this program, she started sleeping from 9pm to 5am at about 10 weeks, and waking up happy and alert.Ezzo's book probably achieves good results if you stick with it, but the difference between the two, as far as I'm concerned, is that Weissbluth's book is relatively easy to implement.They both take a tough stand on going to sleep when sleep is needed, which can be hard. What's different is their criteria for telling when sleep is needed. Weissbluth's seems much more common sense to me, and much less ""extreem""."
5,Fabulous book!,Helps you learn to become a THINKING and RESPONDING parent. Real common sense parenting. It helped encourage a wonderful relationship (including extended breastfeeding) with my daughter.
1,Dangerous advice,"Please don't buy this book. The American Academy of Pediatrics said that following Ezzo's advice has caused dehydration, malnutrition, and failure to thrive in infants. I'm convinced that Ezzo doesn't like children. If you want a good book on baby sleep, try Nighttime Parenting by William Sears."
1,Don't buy this book.,If you love your baby don't buy this book. If you own it throw it away. Feeding your baby on a PDF schedule (parent directed) and denying him food when he's hungry is awful. Letting him cry himself to sleep and calling it a schedule is emotional abuse.
4,Very insightful and honest,I am really enjoying this book! It provides insight into difficult issues and is based on strong Christian principles. It's changed my outlook on sexuality. I def. recomend this!
4,Decent read,"I found this to be a decent read. Rinehart shares some of her personal experiences without straying too much from the overarching point of the text. It was a good go for the initial read; although, I wouldn't necessarily read it again."
5,Chromium Picolinate 500mcg - 120 - Veg Cap by SOLGAR,"I use this to help control my sugar. I take 3 capsules a day. It did help take my sugar down from 300's to 180's so it must be helping. I like it but, I don't know if it is good for everyone so be sure to CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR FIRST."
5,This Gel is Great,"This gel is a soft hold, not sticky at all (must be the fact that there are no synthetics). Scent is clean and fresh. Love it."
1,Worst thing ever,This thing gave me dandruff and my scalp was itching all day.. my hair smelled like a grocery store and made my face all sticky and sweaty.Avoid this styling gel like the plague.
3,Its a vaudeville show,This seems to try its best to be a story CD of an actual vaudeville show. The music had a bit of a different feel that I can't quite place compared to previous Bad Things albums. There is a definable variety to the music included. There's only one or two songs though that seem to really stand out at toe tapping. This'll probably last another month in my car CD player before it makes its way to the shelf and the one or two songs that I really like make it to the .mp3 playlist.
5,Battle Flags of Texans in the Confederacy,This book was very informative and well written. The descriptions and pictures add to the A plus rating delegated to this inspirational piece of historical work. I'd recommend the book to any serious student of the Civil War era.
5,The Book of the Ancient Romans,"In a delightfully organized and thorough book, D. Mills presents the reader with the life of the ancient Romans. While not so much a history book as a study of the Roman civilization, it provides the reader with hours of enjoyable time learning about the Roman culture and the legends behind the greatest civilization in the world."
3,It was Ok,I've been using this item for little over 2 weeks. I have not noticed any major change since using this masque. Its also kinda pricey.
3,Good but some problems,"This book does a good job at explaining what it takes to learn another language, but it doesn't go into enought depth on any of the points. A lot of time is spent explaining how different foreign words are related to English, and that is helpful, but there are too many examples. He also explains gramatical points of certain languages (mostly Indo-European), but he sticks to the same four or five, that readers don't get a larger feel for other languages out there. I know he isn't an expert on all languages, but with just a little research, the book could have had much more information."
3,"Just ok, maybe good for starting cold","There are very few references like this and I'd read a lot of what is out there before I found this. All in all the narrator gives some good tips. But at the same time its nothing new. Nothing you can't find on your own, on the web, in the newsgroups, or by talking with other students of language.There's a little too much reference to specific languages as opposed to language learning theory, what is possible, time tables for learning, etc..Its a little long winded at times and not as usefull as I hoped but I'm not going to criticize it too much. There isn't much like this out there. Barry Farber's book is supposed to be good but I haven't read it and can't compare it to this.All in all this is OK but not very useful if you've been studying a language for some time (months). It'd probably be good if you were just starting and didn't know how to begin."
4,Downcide is some good hard hitting metal,A great record if you like the heavy screaming metal. However songs like Can I Breathe are a sweet breathe of melody. This band blends their style of alt/metal very well.
1,"New, Fresh and Stupefying...","Michael Palermo's new record is an interesting piece of artistic modesty. While I like the rough, unfinished, almost amateurish texture of the songs, his chord progressions and rhythms beg the question: What exactly is Michael Palermo trying to do with this record? A deeply regretted purchase indeed. I might also mention that I was a bit put off with the way he looked."
1,Terrible Turner,I bought this turner and have been quite dissapointed. It seems to melt very easily (...). It is also very stiff making it hard to get under certain items (while flipping properly). I would definately recommend something else.
5,This book is timeless,"My daughter is getting married in June and with the help of this book I was able to have several questions answered. The wedding is going to be beautiful thanks to the ideas that are shared in the book. I am a calligrapher and there are plenty of tips I will be using for the wedding.The pictures are really breath taking and even though the last review was in 2001 today the creations featured are still beautiful! This book is out of print but the time of beautiful designs and creations will live on! I appreciate the fact that ideas are offered for all of the seasons. You will not go wrong get the book...it's worth the price and the suggestions are priceless! ""The Perfect Wedding Reception..."" has found its place on my library shelf and what a treasure it is!"
5,A great help.,"My daughter transformed a church youth building into a gorgeous reception with the help of the many ideas from this book. Grest photos as well. We accomplished the unthinkable,so that the guests didn't have to trsvel to a casino that was too pricey. It was the best reception."
1,The Not So Perfect Wedding Reception,I truly was looking forward to getting this book to help me plan my winter wedding reception. I was very disappointed in what i received. This book is unrealistic for DIY brides.
3,Over priced,This book was a bit over priced and not very useful. I would suggest The Perfect Wedding by Maria McBride-Mellinger.
4,Inspirational,"Broken up into seasons, this book presents beautiful and exquisite ideas for a classy wedding reception; from table settings to floral decorations to wedding favors; inventive color palettes; you're not limited to 1/4 of the ideas - ideas easily adaptable to any season."
3,Ideas for All Seasons,"Her ideas range from table settings to floral decor to food menus to wedding favors. Some of the ideas tend to be on the ""high end"" budget side of things. But I suppose you can easily adapt the ideas to your budget and to your taste. Several of the ideas are season-less, so you get more out of the book than just a 1/4 of it. Wonderful still photography shows the detail of each of her ideas. A good read!"
5,Beautiful book full of ideas,"As a special event floral designer, I have a HUGE library of books from all over the world and this is the BEST one I've found so far.I constantly stress to my clients to look at the big picture when planning a wedding, not just one aspect at a time, such as flowers, colors, linens...This books shows how all the elements of a wedding can work together to give you a wonderful event that looks fantastic. Use this book as a jumping off point for your own wedding, it is full of inspiration,and you can adapt many of the ideas to suit your own color scheme and setting.This book is a MUST HAVE for Brides and anyone in the wedding business."
4,"Whimsical, refreshing, inspiring . . .",". . . just a few words to describe this book. Like her other books, The Perfect Wedding Reception is NOT a how-to book. Nor does it suggest that you have to do everything within its pages. Instead Maria gives us ideas and sparks our imagination so we can create a wedding that is classy, elegant, and fun!Sure, it would cost a fortune to plan a wedding that is exactly like something out of these pages, but how can we find inspiration (and avoid a ""cookie cutter"" wedding) if we don't dare to dream big? Dare to pick one or two ideas from this book that you like, and use them. If they're on a grand scale, pare them down to suit your tastes and budget.As ever, the photography is beautiful.My only complaint is the large resources section - 100 pages that a vast majority of brides will never use."
2,"Fast Shipping, Not What Was Labeled","When I did a search for the exact item I needed, I found this one. However, when I opened my package today, it was not what it was labeled as on Amazon. I ordered hardwired and what I got was wireless. Normally thats great except that now I have to buy a transmitter which is double what the bodypack costs. The good thing is that it got here when I would have needed it. Can't really use it now."
4,Zolof is perscription fun! Do mix with alcohol.,"This band was the 1st of 4 opening bands for Reel Big Fish but BY FAR the best. Their energy and great attitudes are just slightly less addicting than their fun, punk-poppy tunes. Rachel's voice is sunny and confident, and her harpsichord-type thingy is a cool addition to their sound. Tank (drummer) is 10 times more powerful live than is represent on the disc. Vince has got Green Day power chord precision. Instant sing-a-longs, fan friendly access, these guys are a Conan appearance away from big-time. Pick up this CD!! Zolof is the perfect medication for our A.D.D. afflicted music lovers!"
5,Live at Centro de Bellas Artes San Juan Puerto Rico,"You know the quality of a CD by its components, and this CD is by far the most inspiring, uplifting, and even humorous CD created by the famous duo: Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz. True to its meaning, this CD is like the version of ""Old Wine"" put out to taste and enjoy!"
1,mistake,This music sucks. They have the same name as a cool Metal band and I accidently bought this CD. Biggest mistake of my life - almost.
2,Simplistic Yet Confusing,"Used this book in a university course I taught on Accounting for Non-Accounting Majors.My students and I all found the book to be both tedious and confusing. The authors use a hypothetical sporting equipment company (Elevation Sporting Goods, Inc.) as a teaching tool, and then run the students through the drill of incorporating it and performing all of the various accounting and bookkeeping (mostly bookkeeping)functions involved with it.A better book, and the one that I switched to this term isAccounting: What the Numbers Mean. It also uses a hypothetical company as a teaching tool, but includes the adited financial statements of Intel Corporation as an appendix. Its content is appreciably better, as is its computerized help for the student."
2,"Substantial, but out-of-date","If you are looking for clear explanations of basic electrical principles, Mr. Kaiser does an excellent job of using mathmatical formulas to explain them. His examinations of ac theory are clear, concise, and written at apprenctice-level. The writing style is certainly dry.Motor control occupies a very short section at the end of this book, and it is badly out of date. Look elsewhere if you are interested in recent technological advances."
5,very good,This book is really helpful for Electronics Engineering students... who need to add some extra knowledge to be able to function as Electrical Students....excellent self study book
4,Adequate coverage,Great book if you want to learn the ropes of electrical generation. It has plenty of helpful illustrations. Predates smart grid or renewables.
5,Best Nonstick Wok,"I have went through many nonstick wok/stir-fry type pans. Usually the nonstick finish starts to peel away and I end up trashing it to buy another one. I have even had trouble with other nonstick pans where the food actually sticks... I still can't believe how well this wok works. When I brown foods, I can't believe how nice it turns out and it doesn't stick or burn! My food browns crispy without alot of extra fat added. I never had any trouble washing food away when it comes time to clean up. This calphalon nonstick line is the best I've ever used. It is worth the money."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this item because of the ""Flat Bottom"" feature. I have a smooth cooktop. When it arrived, I saw the ""Flat Bottom"" to be no more than 3"" in diameter. This does not allow the wok to heat up efficiently and quickly. I'm sure if the Flat Bottom was bigger I will be thoroughly happy with it. But as it is, I will be returning it."
4,works great!,This product works great. It does take a few weeks (about three) to notice a difference. It does not leave you face oily. You only need a small amount so the product will last a long time.
2,I didn't like it,My skin felt tight and dry no matter how much I used. My skin did tan but I don't feel like it moisturized my skin at all.
3,It is ok,This product is ok as it keep my face moist and smells great but it also left my face a little irritated.
5,Great!,"This product is awesome. Not only does it not make me break out, but it also has helped me make my face considerably darker and it is so light feeling. I don't feel like I need to wash my face after tanning. It's got almost no scent at all and what little scent there is, it's gone by the time you get out of the bed. I also think this product has helped me from having my freckles tan with my face, before using this product I noticed my freckles were starting to get very dark and very unattractive. After using this product my freckles are MUCH less noticeable. I don't think I will ever tan with out this product again. 5 stars!!!! Great buy!"
5,amazing!!,"this product is absolutely awesome..i have horrrible horrible allergies and irritation issues with all sorts of lotions if they touch my face at all but i absolutely loved this. it was really light but still browned me easily! i would deffinately reccommend it to anyone who doesnt want to break out from bronzers like Luminary, ect."
2,Leather Gloves,"The gloves are fine, got them for my husband for Christmas. Should have paid better attention to the shipping rates. Another company that gouges us for shipping because we live in Alaska. Cost double the price of the gloves for shipping when the company could have just put them in a $5 flat rate box. Will not do business with them again. Sorry"
1,Overcharged!,"The company/person who sold this product to me made a major mistake that caused me to lose ALL respect for them. While the product was beautiful and in great condition when it arrived, it also had a price tag on it. I paid $39.99 plus S&H; for a product maked $10.50. I purchased the product thinking I was buying something worth $40, but in reality I received something worth just over $10.Honestly, I cannot tell the difference between a $40 broach and a $10 broach... but I am very disappointed that the seller would quadruple the price of an item. I feel this was an unethical decision on their part.I hope in the future, this company does not try to rip off its customers. But if you feel you must... don't let them know you're doing it.Disappointed,Stephen Moffett"
5,Nice to Have the Originals.,"This DVD set is composed mostly of films from the period. Most of them were produced by the Army and talk about such things as security (Lips closed, you don't know who is listening), preventing sabotage, training, transport (illustrating moving a mythical division from it's training camp to an unknown destination by train -- lots of good pictures from the early army in this one).The dates on the films vary from before the war up through its end. By today's standards these movies are pretty crude. They are even pretty crude when compared with the movies made by the Hollywood professionals that got involved later on.Being a World War II buff, I found the films fairly interesting and this is something I definitely want in my World War II collection. You see some clips from these movies in other films, especially in the historical programs on places like the History Channel. It's nice to have the original movies."
5,Packed with revealing interviews and commentary,"In Black Ice: The Invisible Threat Of Cyber-Terrorism by Dan Verton investigates how cyber-terrorism could occur, what the global and financial implications are, the impact this has on privacy and civil liberties, and why disrupting the cyber infrastructure of the U.S. is of interest to international terrorist organizations, such as al-Qaeda. Black Ice is packed with revealing interviews and commentary from leading government authorities on national security, including Tom Ridge, James Gilmore, Richard Clarke, CIA and NSA intelligence officials - and even supporters of the al-Qaeda terrorist network."
2,Media Hype - Cashing In,"Full of hype, lack of research and poor writing. His chapter on wireless security for example has many technical errors. He makes a note that wireless SSIDs are password which is not true. SSID were never designed to be passwords and have no security value whatsoever. I can only imagine that other claims in the book are also poorly researched.Anyone who witnessed 9/11 knows that its success was attributed to the shear physical and human desctruction and the impact the video of the imploding towers played again and again on tv. I find it hard to believe that the country would be be as terrified if we couldn't access our ATM account. I'll buy the arguement that terrorists could use information warefare to enhance an attack but given limited resources, I'd rather have the money spent on where the real risks lie."
1,How many times can Verton quote himself in his own book?,"This book is far too melodramatic.Also, Verton quotes himself left and right. He used the word ""I"" a few hundred times too many.He quotes and copies from his articles in magazines.This book seems to be more of hype for himself than a serious look at things.Don't read this book, it will only confuse the hell out of you."
4,Not Gary's Best,"I bought this cd cause i'm a BIG GARY MOORE FAN.I like it it's ok not his best,but if your just starting don't start with this one.Try Still Got The Blues or After Hours for blues and for Gary's rock stuff try Corridors of Power or Victims Of The Future.The cd title says it all. He sorta strayed from his bluesy way on this one and went back to the rock he used to play in hte 80's.But the drums sound like drum machines and a lot of the beats fast with an electric uptempo beat.Alli all ot's really different from what he's done but listenable.The song Surrender has Gary's smoking solo in it great guitar work on that song.He covers Jimi Hendrix Fire in his own style not bad and the opening song Go On Home is good too and 1 or 2 others,But if your new to Gary try one of the others i recommended then give this one a try."
2,For Cajun Fans Only,"I bought this disc only for the cut ""Red Red Wine"", the only version I've ever heard that can be slow-danced to as a ballad instead of reggae. It's good music, but I'm not much of a fan."
1,Country Map,"I was disappointed in the map - mostly because of size. I like to have a country map wth me that is about 11"" x 17"" or less, plastic coated for durability, and contains notes about the area. This map was a standard size AAA map, too large for use on a tour bus, for example. Perhaps I did not read the description carefully enough, but it was not what I expected. I returned it to Amazon who asked no questions and refunded my money."
1,Not sure how to rate this....??,"I can't form an opinion on this either way because we didn't use it on our trip. Cabs were cheap enough that we didn't need the map. There's so much to see and all the major sites are well known, so even though there was a language barrier at times, the cab driver would eventually get what we were saying (enough to get us to the pyramids, etc...) and the rest of the time we were on a bus or plane to the other major sites. The info in our guide books was enough extra info for us."
1,No Chinese Included,"This book has absolutely no Chinese characters documented. This makes it rather difficult to learn a language divorced from the writing system, and I think anyone that would use this book is doing a disservice to themselves or their students."
4,storyteller,"In this book Mary Alice Monroe tells us all about losing the land we love. How money, illness and greed has destroyed our farms and land. The low country is featured in this book. It along with beautiful land all over our once beautiful country is dissapearing so fast, it's here one day and gone tomorrow. That's what happens to the Blakely family when the elder father has a stroke. What do they do now? Can they afford to keep the land that developers would love to get their hands on. This a book about love of that land and family. About hanging on by your fingernails and making baskets, one at a time, slowly and lovingly. It's about preserving our heritage and fighting for what's most dear to us. Very good book. The story gives us an even greater lesson then we realize unless we take the time to look at our shrinking lowlands."
2,Anticipation yet disappointed,"I waited for this book from the library for 3 months with great anticipation. I assumed seeing there was a long waitlist, that I would be blown over. Well, Sweetgrass is a story of the Blakely family and the heritage of their land for many generations. Preston, the patriarch of the family has a stroke which spins everything out of control. There are many intertwining family dynamics - son comes home, daughter is loyal to her husband (until the end, wife that wants to please everyone and a sister that wants the cash only. This book gets a 2 star rating because it moves VERY slow and offers little in the way of surprises and suspense. If you want a quick read, OK, but not a very deep or intense story."
5,A Lyrical Tale of Reconciliation and Redemption Set in the South,"In a small southern town, a family must fight against rising taxes, encroaching developers, devastating illness and their own demons to face themselves - and each other - and find long-needed forgiveness.Acclaimed bestselling author Mary Alice Monroe (""Skyward,"" ""The Beach House""), an active conservationist, also weaves into her tender plot and deftly-drawn characters a gentle message about preservation. A lyrical tale of reconciliation and redemption, set against the backdrop of South Carolina's lowcountry."
5,"Consistently, excellent",Not an Author to start to read in bed before falling to sleep. Will be up till early morning. Not good if you have to go to work.
5,Love everything this author writes!!,"I really do love everything this author has written as do my daughter and Mom who have read them as well! I love the stories that Mary Alice Monroe writes and how she weaves love of and experience of nature into stories of family and relationship.I love books from the Carolinas in the Pat Conroy tradition even though I'm from North Dakota and have lived in Houston, Texas almost 20 years. These books have developed my joy of the sea. I always thought I was a lake person but not anymore!"
5,stayed up all night,"Stayed up all night! So many secrets, twists and turns. One of the best books I have ever read!"
4,Pleasant Summer Read,"""Sweetgrass"" was a lovely afternoon read. I could see and smell the Lowcountry marsh, water, sweetgrass and moist air. I liked reading of a family coming back to one another after tragedy and loss, and separation. The characters were diverse and I could connect with many of them through the perspectives the author shared on them. And now I want a Sweetwater basket!"
1,You get what you pay for.,"Had this in my turnouts for about a year. The first time I tried to use the seat-belt cutter it didn't work. I had to use the blade, which did the job. Next time I tried to use the knife it fell apart when I unfolded it. Lost a couple of pieces so I just threw the rest away. Piece of junk. Send a little extra and get a good quality knife that will work when you need it to."
4,I'm playing this CD over and over,"Like some of the previous reviewers, I find it easy -- make that compelling -- to listen to Jenny DeVoe's CD over and over. I keep it in my favorite vehicle and listen to it while driving ... and don't we all save only our favorite CDs for driving? Jenny's music is thoughtful without being depressing (hello, Paula Cole?), and her voice is distinctive without sounding forced. This is a good one; give it a go!"
2,Can't wait for her new cd!,"I've seen Jennie DeVoe several times around town, have her cd, and have seen her overalls at American Bandstand. Does She Walk On Water is nothing but great music. Every song fits a mood or relationship. Can truly identify with what she sings. So looking forward to the next cd!"
4,vocal expressionist with muscle and intelligence...,"there is muscle in this woman's voice as well as lyrical beauty and soul. this is a damn good cd, a mix between melissa etheridge and jewel, edgy and serene at the same time. very good writing and instrumentation."
5,A necessity with Calphalon,"This cutter is essential if you plan on baking with Calphalon. It does a surprisingly good job of cutting through baked goods given that it's nylon. Most importantly, it won't harm the non-stick surface on your bakeware. I've found (the hard way) these surfaces to be susceptible to even the lightest pressure with a metal blade. So, flip the six bucks and protect your bakeware!"
5,"WOW, What a story!","Debra has done a masterful job of combining real life experiences and imagination into a wonderful, suspenseful story.I found the characters true to life and full of life. This deals with issues in a realistic manner. Thank You Debra for an enjoyable ReadRecommendation: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDTim Hancock is the Director of MWLA, a Reviewer and Author"
3,"Love Cotton Rib Blankets, But....","...after I washed this one to get ready for my daughter's arrival, I noticed a hole in it! I'm going to take it back to the store and exchange it for another one. I really like cotton ribbed blankets. My 2 year old son is STILL attached to the one he's had since he was a baby. The blankets are especially great for when the weather isn't terribly cold but you still need a little something to cover up with. I have also found these blankets to be bigger than the normal ""receiving blankets.""By the way, I've always washed these blankets in the washing machine on the delecate cycle and then tumble dryed them in the dryer on low. They're still holding up!"
3,Washing instructions have been changed!,"When I received this blanket I loved it. It was soft and a nice color pink (not ""pepto pink""). I went to wash it so it's ready for use when baby arrives and was surprised to find a sticker placed over the original washing instructions, stating to machine/hand wash cold and drip dry. When I followed these new instructions (keeping in mind that it's advised not to use fabric softner on baby stuff) the blanket dried kind of stiff. I don't think I would like this blanket if I was baby - I would prefer the flannel ones that I have that go in the dryer and come out nice and soft. I am going to try tumble drying it, taking the chance that it might fall apart."
1,This is Hand Washable Only,I also received this blanket with the new sticker over it. It is no longer machine washable. Who really wants to hand wash a blanket whenever it gets spit up on it? Give me a break. You guys should really change the ad for this one.
3,"Worth it for ""Gin & Juice"" alone","The Gourds dig into the roots of American music with a greater, more expansive enthusiasm than anybody since the Band. Shinebox is an odds and ends collection, featuring 5 live tracks and assorted covers. The covers range from old traditionals (""Dooley"", ""Jones Oh Jones"", ""I'm Troubled"") and expected contemporary twangers (Townes Van Zandt's ""Two Girls"", Billie Joe Shaver's ""Omaha"") to the left field additions of Nils Lofgren (""Everybody's Missing the Sun"") and the gasp-inducing inclusion of David Bowie's ""Ziggy Stardust"" and Snoop Dogg's ""Gin and Juice"". The latter brilliantly combines 100 years of music, offhandedly proving the similar bloodlines of modern hip hop and hillbilly jug bands. It's an unbelievably profound statement, and the fact that the Gourds toss it off with an irreverent ease only reinforces their genius."
2,The first two songs are fanstastic,"I really enjoy the first two songs on the album, they are fantastic--the cover of ""Gin and Juice"" is a classic--but as the album progresses, I find myself liking it less and less. The singing on the live songs later in the album leaves something to be desired."
4,"Great for new Gourds fans, good for long-time Gourds fans","I love this album, but I've got to give it 4 stars because of the lack of original material. I've already got a ton of live stuff (get the Best of Boots series!) and I enjoyed the remakes, but I'd rather hear their original song writing. Best tracks are Omaha, Plaid Coat, Lament and of course, Gin and Juice."
3,Shinebox. Box this Shine,"This is a real good cd. The song ""Omaha"" is a very good song but the Gourds cover is not quite as good as the original old country song ""Omaha"""
1,"trying to fugure out how to over come my probems ,other out there","I bot he product comp usait come in a dvd looking case, but its a CD rom.

3,Magnetic Checkers,I purchased the Magnetic checkers for my grandsons ages 5 and 7 1/2. The've learned now how to play checkers and this one was handy for taking in the car and to day care. However they have already misplaced 5 pieces. Maybe this product should come with a few extra pieces for crowning early kings and replacing lost pieces.
3,Careful..very small!,"This item would definitly be more properly termed a noetpad vice notebook. It is very small. The picture on the front is nice however. All pages inside are blank...no graphics. I used this item to put me over $25 for free shipping, so for that purpose it was perfect."
1,I Never Received the Product,"I really cannot say anything about the product, becaused I never received it and I asked them to send it twice.It was suppose to be sent with another product. I worte to say it was not in the package and asked for it to be sent. I have not heard anything back and I have not received it. I know it is only a $1.50 notebook, but should that matter?"
3,Small and cute.,"I wasn't expecting it to be quite so small/flimsy. It doesn't have a whole lot of pages, but the butterfly design is lovely. What little paper it contains is of a decent quality for taking notes or jotting down ideas. It fits conveniently in a purse or pocket. I feel that this butterfly notebook was worth the price, although I probably wouldn't be willing to pay any more for it. I don't regret buying it, but I wonder if maybe a large, hard-cover journal might have been more useful, since I had originally considered using it for keeping track of my poetry ideas."
2,Not what I had expected,"I expected an actual notebook. Instead this was a small address book sized, no lined pad of paper. Good for jotting down a number or something, but not at all what i had expected. It was on clearence so not the worst $1.50 I ever spent. lol. pretty though."
3,Pretty but small,"I got the butterfly notebook along with some of the impressionist art notebooks for party favors. They are very pretty but surprizingly small - I thought they would be hardcover and journal size, but they are lightweight paperback and the size of a small address book. Not quite sure what they could be used for."
4,Disappointed my fault,"It's my fault I'm disappointed. I didn't read the discription. I saw Butterfly and thought it was a book on butterflys, not a note pad. Always read before buying."
1,Butterfly notebook,Never rec'd order so how am I supposed to rate this? I really wanted this item for my daughter who loves notebooks and such but am not a happy camper since the order never arrived.
3,Careful Small Alert,this is an ok product has a nice front photo but is extremly little and blank pages but i used it for free super saver shipping
3,Very Pretty Cover,"I got this notebook for the beauty-factor! However; the pages are not lined; which I would have found to be a negative factor. [I may have missed that detail in the writeup]. For the very reasonable price, there are alot of uses for this notebook; and it is very handy in that regard!"
2,Small but cute,It is a pretty little notebook. It's a nice size. It's easy to fit in your purse. Makes a nice little gift.
2,Not a notebook,I guess I should have read the reviews better. It's not a notebook...should be called a note pad..It's tiny! And the price is printed on the back. Lame
2,very small,"It is small and has no lined pages,and does not have very much paper.I got it for school and plan on not being able to use it."
1,review,I don't really have a review for this as it is just a pad of blank paper that I can use for the care or grocery list or whatever...
1,Notebook?,"I wasn't very happy with this purchase. Although the cover is pretty, the ""notebook"" is tiny (app. 4x5""). I was thinking it was going to be what I call notebook size (5""x7"" at least). You cannot remove the pages very well either (no perforation), and there are only 32 pages in the book. The printed price on the rear cover is $1.50, so I did not get a bargain at all! Very displeased with this purchase."
5,A wonderful upgrade from the Big Lots set!,"I just received the 10 piece Calphalon Professional Nonstick II set as a wedding gift, and absolutely love it! The non-stick surface actually works, unlike the last set we had. I made scrambled eggs this morning, and it almost seemed like they were cooking on air because they didn't touch the sides of the pan. Clean up is a breeze, and they seem to produce a very even cooking heat. The metal handles stay cool to the touch, but the lid handles do get hot."
3,Go commercial instead...,"I had a Professional Nonstick II frypan for about two years, and loved it, using it nearly every day. I even wrote reviews on Amazon attesting to how wonderful the pan was. BUT, then my Professional Nonstick II surface started to wear out, with an increasingly sticky center (arggh!). I will probably have to take advantage of that Lifetime Warranty.However, I now have bought the Calphalon Commercial Nonstick 12"" pan, which is occasionally on special for around 25 bucks. The Commercial Nonstick line has the superior LRS3 nonstick coating compared to the cheaper LRS coating on the Professional line. It can cost a little more, but it's worth it.Believe me, it makes a difference!So, go commercial, you won't be disappointed."
4,a great set of cookware,I received the calphalon set of cookware as a wedding gift and we've loved using all of the pieces. The only problem we've found is that the handle on the lid gets extremely hot (the Revereware never did that) and the handle on the pan itself gets very hot so make sure no little ones are around to grab the handle while you're cooking! Just keep a hotpad around - you'll enjoy the pans
4,Quality and good looks,"Finally got a set of the new Prof non Stick II series. They are not just good looking. Even heat, great non-stick performance, easy cleaning. I really like the stay cool handles- they do not get hot, so no need for pot holders all the time like with my old Calphalon Commercial. The glass lids are good, too - to keep an eye on simmering, etc. Overall- I love them. Also- good in the oven to 450 degrees- another very handy feature (especially at thanksgiving when all pots are in use and you want to keep things warm...). Watch out for the temp of the lid handles, though - ouch... Go for it- and add a 12"" regular (no non stick) to the collection for the times when you want a sticky browning pan. You'll be set for life.Folowup- Its 2004 now (originally bought in 2000) and we are still using the set daily. No signs of wear to the non-stick coating. Still very happy with them. And, they look good enough to hang up in the kitchen, which we did, freeing up tons of cabinet space!"
4,I agree!,"This is a wonderful nonstick cookware set! These are heavy-duty, yet user friendly pots and pans. I recieved this set for Christmas last year and have been in cooking heaven ever since!The only problem that I've seen with the pans, is that while the interior is extremely easy to clean, the outside is very easily soiled and stained. After one year of use, the outside of all of the pots and pans is spotted and streaked with darker colored areas. I don't know if this is from oily foods that have splashed over, or if it is just basic build-up. I've tried lots of elbow grease along with all of the cleansers that Calphalon recommends and nothing seems to take the discoloration away. This might not be a problem for those with gas ranges -- I've always heard that electric stoves make the exterior of cookware dirtier.Other than that, this set is fabulous. The handles will last forever, the nonstick coating is unbeatable, and this set contains all of the sizes that the average cook needs."
5,Calphalon Professional Nonstick II,I have owned Calphalon professional NonStick I for years and love it. It is the easies cookware to clean and cooks very evenly. Any one who is buying cookware for the first time .. spend the extra money and buy a good set .. this would be one that I would recommend.
5,"Sturdy, versatile and a brand you can trust!",This is a nice set of cookware to get started with. I just love the stay cool handles which come in handy when you instinctively grab the handle as i do. (Have burnt myself many times with others). What made the biggest difference for me is the glass lids. I like to see my food w/o disturbing it. Nice variety to get you started with.
5,Simply the best,"Calphalon cookware is the best for the home chef. With proper care, the nonstick surface will last for many, many years but that is true of most nonstick cookware. What makes Calphalon special is that is a very efficient cooking surface. In other words, it takes much less heat from the burner to cook on Calphalon. Many chefs learn this the hard way by cooking a recipe that they know well for the first time on their new Calphalon and burning the meal.The one downside to these pans is that the handles are metal and will get very hot. You should always use oven mitts or, better yet, get the cozies that they sell to use on the handles."
2,Watch out for lemon juice,"For such expensive pots and pans, these are easily damaged by a very common cooking ingredient: lemon juice. Want to cook a fish with a little lemon and olive oil? Better reach for a different pan. And don't even think of letting anything marinate in these pots! If you're willing to spend so much for pots, I'd look at All Clad's lines, which are much more durable."
3,"Fun, I guess","I'm in love with Scooby- Doo, but this game would not be for anyone over 11. It gives the basics of hide-and-go-seek, but in a ""Scoobyish"" kinda way. overall, I thought the toy was cute, but didn't have fun playing with it.b/c i'm 13, and i kinda got over the hide-and-go-seek thing."
4,Good value,"Once you get past the black and white line drawings, the information about Irish Chains is solid and easy to understand. This book explains the differences between the three types and simplifies their construction. Not much money for a book discussing this very specific type of quilt piecing. It is humorous to find that the author prefers to mark the cloth and cut with scissors instead of rotary cut. None the less, directions were easily modified to my preferred method."
3,"Irish Chain Quilts: Singl, Double and Triple",Not nearly as informative as I expected. I really expected a lot more detail. I feel like it was overpriced for the amount of instruction it contained
2,Very disappointing...,"I ordered this for my husband & it did not turn out to be a good purchase. There was not enough room in it for him & over a fairly short time it began to have problems with the zipper & also with the materials inside disintegrating. It looked good when we first bought it, but did not hold up because of poor quality of materials. Ended up having to buy another one, which is not really cost effective!"
3,Soft Metal,"The quality of the Leather is fine, It's the metal zipper that I'm not happy with... Very soft metal, sort of flimsy."
2,boring compared to original Unreal,"I kept waiting for this game to dazzle me in some way like the original Unreal did, with its magical characters, visuals, and score. That moment never came. It's practically the same game as Halo. I don't know who ripped off who, but the similarities are striking. When I reached a 'boss' part which I couldn't mitigate after many attempts (the difficulty level seemed to double, suddenly) I put this baby on the shelf to collect dust."
3,Average at best,"I guess I just have very strange skin because I reviewed all kinds of moisturizers before purchasing this one. I found that initial application was smooth and it has a nice fragrance, but about 4 hours later i was very shiny and greasy feeling. Also after several days of using it, it caused some small breakouts. Overall, its not a bad moisturizer, I just think I'll have to stick to Lancome for my very sensitive skin."
4,Better than other day cream in market,i have large pores in my face. when i apply his creame it gets absorbed very fast and hides the pores and black heads.I ve tried all the creames. This one suits my skin the best. I dont feel greasy. still after 3 hours my face looks greasy. Hope oil of olay introduces a new cream which will solve that problem
1,Don't buy it,"This is not the old Olay Complete. It is reformulated and is very bad. It burns your face, smells and made my face red. Someone in one of the bad reviews on Olay's website, by the way all of the reviews I read were negative, suggested Neutrogena. So I'll will be trying it because my two new bottles of this stuff are going in the garbage."
1,Wrong Product,"This product is exactly what I wanted. Bought the new formula at Walmart and took it back cause it irritated my skin. So I found what I wanted on Amazon and ordered three. The product I received was the new formula, not what was pictured. Very disappointed but they sent a return shipping label right away to send the product back. Don't know if I'll buy online now or not. Might have to try something else. Boo Hoo!"
1,very unhappy,"GMS Market didn't send the product that they advertised. The emails from them were rude, and they didn't refund all the shipping. I will watch very closely and not order anything from that company again."
2,Olay Complete old formula is returning!,"I loved this product, until last Fall (2009), when they changed the ingredients. Now it burns and makes my face feel hot. I checked out olay.com and found many reviews reciting the same issues.I am happy to report that Olay said they are bringing back the previous formula in April 2010!! Thank you Olay!"
5,THE BEST COUNTRY FOR 2000.,THIS MUSIC IS VERY GOOD. I AM A COUNTRY MUSIC DJ IN ST. LUCIA AND THIS MUSIC IS THE BEST I HAVE FOR THIS YEAR. THIS ARTIST SHOULD KEEP IT UP. PRAISES TO ALL COUNTRY LOVERS THEY SHOULD TRY THIS ONE.
3,"A good product, but sometimes over priced","It's as good as most decent wisks, but sometimes I've seen it over priced. Calphalon products are in my kitchen, some I like, some are OK. My other wisks work just as good and are lower priced in most cases."
2,Not what I expected.,"When I purchased this item, I thought I would be receiving a regular cylindrical whisk. Consequently, I was rather disappointed when this whisk arrived. This whisk is flat in design and not at all what I was expecting and unfortunately will not be something I will ever use."
2,Flimsy,I am very dissappointed in this product. I have both the flat and the ballon whisk and both are too flimsy to really get the job done. In order to get enough leverage to whip I have to hold the handle very close to the whisk itself (read egg yolks all over your hand). Not a functional kitchen tool.
2,Really?,"I thoroughly enjoyed Metcalf's book Buddha In Your Backpack, thinking it was a great step into this wonderful practice. This book did no justice to the author or The Buddha, himself. It was an easy cash-in on an overused phrase. I feel much of these answers to what The Buddha might have done in these situations. I was appalled to read what the author felt that The Buddha would have felt about eating meat. Really? Other reviewers call it a ""fun"" and ""witty"" take on The Buddha's morals and teachings, but I think its just downright embarrassing that they feel they have to be subjected to that to be able to soak in the knowledge. Better luck next time, Franz."
4,Buddha under your Christmas Tree,"I enjoyed this book immensely. Thought provoking and informative, great for dipping into and not above a laugh alongside its deeper messages. Could be that gift you're looking for."
3,Doesn't do Buddha justice,"Although written with good intentions, WWBD does not live up to expectations. Most of the ""questions"" are contrived, and most of the text on the pages doesn't really provide any insight. I've gotten more of an idea of What Buddha Would Do by reading Thich Naht Hahn's books."
1,Sales Gimick/exploitation/commercialism,"This author realizes that Buddhism is gaining popularity in the west and is cashing in on it. This is a great example of the West taking an Eastern Philosophy, cutting out much of the substance and neatly packaging it for mass consumption. It is actually quite disturbing. I imagine the author had good intentions and just didn't realize what a diservice he is doing. I disagree with many of his opinions of ""What the Buddha Would Do."" It almost seems like he is justifying his own actions by stretching Buddhist teachings to match his own opinion. It is also filled with contradictions. For instance, one ""answer"" states that the Buddha would be okay with eating meat. A few pages later it talks about the Buddha's divine reverence for life and that one should never destroy it. I think it is sad that this misrepresentation may be the only exposure some people have to Buddhism."
1,Tae Kwon-Do Book for Kids,I got this book for my 8 year old when she started TaeKwon-do last year. The only good thing about the book was it told you what order the belts went and what the meaning of them were. The kicks were hard to follow and there was not any basic kicks in it.
1,"Don't you mean ""The Incomplete Tae Kwon Do for Kids""","There are minimal photos in this book and except for the cover, they were all photos of black-belt-looking adults doing kicks that only an expert kid could do. I'd recommend the other ""Tae Kwon Do For Kids."" There are excellent demonstration photos and the book is cheaper to boot. Much better for beginning kids."
2,Good for 6 months,"We purchased this knowing that it would have a short life-span considering the mileage that we would be putting on it, but we were surprised how quickly the machine deteriorated. Purchased in November 2006, by the beginning of May the belt was slipping so much that it was unusable. Once we began tightening the belt ourselves, the machine lasted another two weeks with occasional slipping. However, on the final occasion of use, the metal piece holding the bolt, upon tightening, snapped which ended our use of the product."
4,Nice case,"Well made out of nice leather. Tight fit. Fits average size frames, but if your glasses are fashionably wide, they might not fit."
5,SONGS FROM DVGN!!!,"I WANT TO GET THIS CD REAALY BADLY,BECAUSE I DOWNLOADED THE SONGS FROM A WEBSITE CALLED DVGN(IT'S GONE NOW,KERO,MAY YOUR SITE REST IN PEACE)ANYWAY,I SAW THE INTRO AND TYPE:WILD,AND I LOVE THEM!!!I LISTENED TO THEM EVERY DAY NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I HAD TO DOWNLOAD THEM!!!BUT WHEN THE SITE LEFT,I WAS SOOOO UPSET,I THOUGHT I'D NEVER HEAR THEM AGAIN,UNTIL I FOUND OUT THIS CD EXISTED!NOW I'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR THEM ALL I WANT!!I'M DEFENITELY GETTING IT!! (NOTE TO KERO:I MISS DVGN ALOT.IF YOU READ THIS,TELL ME WHERE TO FIND THE ENDING SONG WITH ASH,MISTY,AND BROCK DANCING AND THE SINGING CHANSEY!!)"
5,Awesome Meditation Music,"This is the original real thing: Zen Meditation music from Japan, recorded at JVC studios in Japan, 1994.Very calming and meditative, good for listening or doing massage or any healing practice with."
4,MITCH IN THE DEJÀ VU AREA,"There was already a Mitch Miller Greatest Hits album releaaed a few decades back. There are, I think, several faces to Mitch Miler. The choir conductor. The march conductor, and the novelty musician. This collection should have been called 'A Mitch Miller Portrait' and featured some of each of those. One knows Mitch Miller best, I suppose, for the singing gang of television fame, with their own theme, SING ALONG. More of those songs should have been included. Also more of the great marches. And perhaps more of the novelty songs, like THE HAPPY WANDERER. I think Mitch Miller had the best version of that song. This album is a bit of a letdown, but enjoyable just the same."
2,Disappointing,"My grandson loves the Disney Sing-Along song videos that feature real children, not animations, Each of those (It's a Small World, Beach Party, and Campout) would receive an A+ rating from both of us. This video was simply disappointing because it had fewer children singing, less entertaining songs, and more animated parts."
3,Good for young kids,I bought this for my 5 year old because she has the Disneyland Sing a long and really likes it but it was a little young for her. It is cute though- would recommend it for 2-4 yr olds.
3,Who knew kids would want to watch this when its not Halloween,"I originally bought this for my son because I thought it would be great to get him in the Halloween spirit ,but it turns out that my son and niece have been watching it year around. So far its being watched at least once every month. I am considering buying them a Christmas Sing A Long seeing how they will watch their movies out of season. This sing a long also teaches them songs that I forgot about like 10 Little Indians and teaches me the words to The Monster Mash. Have FUN!"
3,Ok,This was a gift for a friend who likes old music. I am not sure if he likes it or not. He did not comment on it. So I guess it was ok but not what he expected.
5,Great DVD,"How come nobody reviewed this? This is the end of the heart snatcher arc, Kaorinite returns, Rini (chibi-usa) is kidnapped, and the fate of Sailors Saturn and Pluto are revealed. You should watch this!"
3,no instruction on how to palce felt or cork pad ?? no replacement order form,I couldnt find anything on deciding which one to use cork or felt pad with self adhesive to palce on face of the kick pedal. There is no info on where to order for replacements .. The kick pedal can act like a scorpion sting if you are not careful with the playing... becaue of the protuding rod pointing backward . There should be a foam ball to cover the protuding rod.
1,Wakeup Amazon,I was thinking of purchasing an extended service plan till I read the reviews from customers. Wakeup Amazon & remove this company from your website. They are a embarassment to your great reputation & customer service !
2,Poor effort- the worst of the series (2 stars),"I am not sure what I was expecting from this album, but whatever that expectation was it clearly was not met. Very uninspired, weak production, and not particularly engauging like other discs in the series. While releases like 'Vietnam' have a lot of soul and ambience, the Cuba release fell short in every capacity. Admittedly the bar for Cuban music has been set high, but this effort by Milan records was garbage. Maybe that is why the series was never completed. Milan was more concerned about a hip image than the quality of the music. Terribly dissapointing. Vietnam was MUCH better..."
5,I love it,"I rate the product ""i love it"", because the book is in good conditions and it was very cheap. And it will be very usefull in college :)"
1,"Lousy is better than awful, but it's still bad...","The director got himself one of those two-for-one labotomies at K-Mart, he rewrote the script, and turned this film into a comedy that wasn't funny and a thriller that wasn't scary. McDowell tried, but then so did the navigator on the Titanic. Thumbs down..."
2,Not so great,"This journal kinda stunk for me because I thought it would give me more of a guide about what to write. It simply said ""write about this or that"" and gave a Bible verse. I really thought it was going to be more interactive or something. I was really disappointed. It's good for people who just want to write about stuff anyway, but not really for people who want a deeper insight to Christ."
5,AWESOME,"This journal is unlike any other. It gives you a starting point for each day's entry. I love the fact that it is not dated--I never get behind. I can write in it whenever I feel the need. I have come to know myself better through this one-of-kind journal. More importantly, I have strengthened my relationship with God! You won't be disappointed with this purchase! It also makes a wonderful gift for people of all ages."
4,Low brow humor with a good stry interwoven thruout,"This a book for everyone that doesn't mind a LOT of sexual humor. Eichiki Onizuka is a down in the dumps punk who spends all day looking up girls' skirts. When he finds out that high school girls want their teachers, he decides to be a teacher for the love and sex. When he turns a groups of O (lowest level of education) group kids into hard working students, he decides he really wants to be a teacher. The humor is just perfect and Onizuka has more faces than Digimon (I like the gritty style most). The only reason this got a 4 was because it got too dramatic sometimes, like in the Happiness in a Six-Mat Apartmentstory. =GEt this now."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE,"I've already watched the complete Anime TV series. I loved it so much that I did not expect that the Mange could have bin any better however the manga is much better then the TV series. It's about a punk biker who decides to become a teacher. There's comedy, action, love, brief nudity, mindless violence and everyone likes mindless violence... Just buy the damn thing."
5,Very Informative,"This Is a Very informative book for teachers and kids alike. It has many activities in it such as map making, recipes from around the world, games, storys, and much, much more. Very Great Book"
3,"Good, not perfect.","The product works well, and is easy to wire with a fairly straightforward install.Things to watch out for:-""Green"" is actually closer to turquoise.-If you have one of those gearshifts that has a lock to prevent you from accidentally shifting into reverse, it could take some work to get this installed properly.-The light emits a high-pitched whine when it's turned on. Not too loud though, a good stereo covers it up."
4,Great Screenplay Potential,"The character development in this novel is exceptional. The twists and turns in the plot lend the book to an adventure filled and suspensefull movie, as do the beautiful and diverse settings Most definitely a ""two thumbs up"" novel and movie."
5,A good value,"I wear these headphones around all day and although you can feel them on your ears after several hours their light weight makes them quite comfortable. The sound is pretty good and they're quite rugged. I've repeatedly dropped them, snagged the cord several times and they have survived. For the price they can't be beat!"
2,BEWARE - NOT A 5 star album,"I bought this pricey...CD based on the glowing reviews I saw on this site. Unfortunately this album does NOT deliver the goods! I was looking for straightforward chill out & was surprised by the heavy middle eastern musical overtones throughout the album which to me do not mix well with down tempo electronica. A lot of it is rather cheezy. Should be called chill out in Baghdad. If you read through the other reviews, it seems as if the album creators themselves actually wrote them!"
1,"Long, Hard Ride","Imagine a movie like Airplane, only with a change of setting. Oh, and the jokes aren't funny. Here's a clue, folks: wacky doesn't equal funny without a little help, and this movie could use more than a little help. It has it's moments, but they aren't worth waiting for."
4,Transylvania Twisted,"Take 1500 puns, 500 sight gags, 3 musical numbers, a reference to almost every horror movie, at least 40 impersonations ( jack is the best ) the most confusing townfolk since Blazing Saddles hands down ( or more correctly Hans Up ), loads of cleavage, Robert Vaugn, ""The Tall Man"", and a special Ghost appearance by Boris Karloff and you have a pretty good movie. They could have put in an extra 10 minutes of Bloopers and out takes as a good bonus, and Wide Screen would have made it a topper. A movie that you will find something new in each viewing I'm sure. And remember don't drink anything that will hurt coming out your nose the first time you watch it."
2,Too cheesy and not funny,"I ordered this movie because I read other reviews and thought it would be a good laugh. It really isn't. It is basically more cheese than wit. If you like cheesy, this is for you. If you like a little bit more to your plot, even if it is humor, I'd say pass this one up. I plan on donating this one to our local thrift shop. If I liked it better, I would give it to a friend. I like offbeat humor and I enjoy the combo of humor and mystery or thriller. This is just eighties cheese at its worst. I don't think even during its time I would have liked it and I have liked some cheesy stuff. It isn't as bad as I've seen. I've seen worse. It isn't very good though. If you want cheap entertainment that you likely won't treasure, go ahead and watch it. Otherwise, go with Young Frankenstein or something a little more funny if you still want the cheese."
4,Enjoyable Horror Spoof,"Transylvania Twist is a pleasant, enjoyable, and goofy horror spoof. The problem is that the sound on the DVD isn't the best, and I was struggling to hear a lot of the dialogue on my computer. But the movie is good. It sort of reminded me of the Elvira movies. And Jim Wynorski is one of my favorite directors, and this was when he was at the top of his game churning out fun movies left and right. Brinke Stevens even has a cameo, as does Jason, Freddy Krueger, and Leatherface!"
5,Aikawa Nanase - New Maxi Single - China Rose,"The single itself is Breath taking! While I cannot forget that there is another song or 2 or three on the CD, 'China Rose' will capture the attention (Though the others are simply outstanding!) China Rose is a really somewhat slow beat that has a snapping rhythm to it almost Jazzy with a light touch of the blues.Track listing:1) China Rose2) BUB3) White SongWorth the money?: YOU BET! THIS SINGLE WAS SO GOOD! I WAS AMAZED!"
1,Guitar or Drums?,"The product description doesn't match the picture. I have a FirstAct FG182 that is similar to the guitar pictured and it is not worth the $5 my wife paid for it at a garage sale. Not a single string will stay in tune, the neck warps with ANY tension, the nut fell off and wasn't worth putting back on, etc... I would have paid $5 to not have it in my house, but my 7 year old wants to fix it up and we haven't thrown it away yet. I am still mad that I spent a couple of hours trying to make it work somehow when the guitar isn't even worth throwing in the fire place."
4,Sturdy set of drums,Very happy with product. I do wish that it had come with a stool though. It is definitly sturdy enough for a 3 year old to use.
1,silver glitter,"This dessert glitter is not silver or glittery at all. It is dull and gray, looks like dirty dust. Bought it to use on my daughter's birthday cupcakes but will not be using it after all. No wonder there is no image displayed for this item. Do not waste your money on this."
4,"Clear, concise, vegetarian survival kit","Here is a book that a vegetarian can love! The recipes are varied, the food delicious, and the diet nutritious. All of this is served up with lucidity and humor. A treat all around."
5,A Must for Artists or Collectors,"Working in the comic book industry has led me to some neat product ideas, marketing, and more. Itoya products are a presentation/protector must if you want your work to look professional and stylish at the same time.This 4x6 is great for professional photography prints, holding smaller sketches or sketch cards, etc. I even keep on with me during family reunions for photo trades. It keeps items rigid and safe.If you are contemplating a different product over ANY Itoya, don't. Itoya is the best and you won't regret your purchase."
5,great buy!,"broke down and finally got a laptop. always stayed away from them since i always thought that they were very hard to upgrade. but this can have the memory upgraded up to 2 gigs, and with the integrated wireless lan and cd burner-that really put this over the top.besides, i snapped it up very quickly at best buy for only $750. what a steal. wirless networking is a snap with xp, now i can get around the house, sit and work, answer email and watch tv. just a great little laptop- very happy with this purchase."
5,Good machine!,"It has been a year since I bought this laptop. It is my first system and I would like to say that it has been working properly so far. I know about the Compaq reputation, however, I dare to say that this product shows good qualities.I do not have the problems like the others with the wi-fi. The wireless router is located in my roommate's room and I have never had any problems with the Internet connection.I use the computer primarily for downloading music, programs, some multitasking, research in Internet, and burning CDs, etc. I keep the system working for long hours, however, this does not affect the performance at all. It is very quiet.The only flow is maybe the battery which keeps up for just an hour and a half--two hours. Besides this I would say it was a great choice for a first laptop! I paid the price of 750$ from Best Buy. It was Jan of 2006."
3,Poor wifi,"I have the V2570NR and have had it for 4 months. For the first month the wifi worked fine. Then it got worse and worse until the point where I can only connect via wifi when I'm within 5 feet of the transmitter. My wife's laptop does not have this problem. Very poor, considering it cost $750."
5,The best LIVE album that I had ever seen,"All the best hits of the band are here together in this acclaimed band form Minas Gerais, a brazilian state, with the exception of ""Ando Meio Desligado"", that are of not much importance. In fact, their perfomance in the show was excellent (although it was only 200 people watching). All old hits very vell perfomed, with the exception of ""Eu"", that was incredible calm and boring, but ""Um Dia, Um Ladrao"" was excellent, as ""Made in Japan"", ""Depos"" and ""Menti Para Voce"" were. Also, they included a reasonable amount of new tracs, including new hits ""Por Perto"" (one of the best songs in the CD) and ""Nao Mais"". Excellent album and awensome perfomance, I highly recommend."
5,Fantastic Voice,"I've listened to this CD over and over and never get tired of her voice and lyrics. The beauty of her songs hits you right in the heart and stays with you all day. Poignant and moving, this is a must for anyone who likes KD Lang, Sinead O'Connor etc. Can't wait to hear the next release."
3,Misleading description,"The description of the CD incorrect and misleading - this is NOT a famous JVC XRCD format but rather 20BitK2, which is better than regular CD but not as good as XRCD"
1,"Beware !!!! Don,t buy any Savio products !!!","While the product did clear the water in my pond, it shorted out and melted in less than a year. Savio refused to honor the 1 year warranty even though I hand proof of purchase. Try the Aqua brand instead. Does the same job for less money. I will never buy any Savio product again."
5,Excellent reference for constitutional history information!,"The Oxford Companion To The Supreme Court of the UnitedStates is an excellent reference, not only for it'sinformation on the various Justices that have served overthe years, but also for it's concise reviews of legal andgovernment terms and concepts. This work providesinformative reviews of the U.S. Constitution, the Amendments,the major cases in constitutional development, and politicalphilosophies. For student's of history, law, or constitutionaldevelopment, this book is a must. Throw away your casebook,your history book, your copy of the constitution, and allthe biographies you've collected on Supreme Court Justices.This is the only book you will ever need to get throughcollege level government classes. Truly The Best!"
3,Out-dated,"Good resource for general Supreme Court information and pre-1992 key cases. However, as those who follow the Supreme Court know, much has happened in the intervening 9 years since the book was published. We currently have a very conservative, yet very active Supreme Court. New judicial trends are emerging in the areas of federalism and congressional commerce powers that are suddenly vastly different from what they had been from the New Deal up until 1995. A glance at recent cases such as The City of Boerne v. Flores and the mind-boggling Bush v. Gore show the Supreme Court's reinterpretation of the reach and power of the 14th Amendment. In short, many of the precedents outlined in this book are no longer valid.For a more current, and cheaper, book that covers much of the same ground, check out The Oxford Guide to United States Supreme Court Decisions, released in 1999. It only covers the cases, unlike ""The Companion;"" but that's kinda' the point isn't it?"
3,hmmmm,"I'm not too sure about this book. It seemed like a lot of work to make some not very impressive designs. I like to tat to relax, and this book got me anxious.I think this book would be great for someone who wants to learn and/or make use of split rings. I was looking for some nice heart shapes, but I wasn't satisfied with this book."
2,Not fun or happy,"I had hoped this was a fun and happy book but have found it overwhelming. So many different techniques, which I appreciate cause us to stretch, but when the first one I tried, that looked simple, was an ordeal, and it was labeled Novice, I felt as dumb as a board. Did not feel so happy or much fun. Could we have had some pretty, simple hearts too?"
4,Does the Job,"This hat is meant for surfing, but I bought it for white water rafting (I was tired of losing my hat every year). This year I was pushed, dunked, bucked, and flipped into the water and it never came off. It was never a problem when I was in the water either. Overall it feels pretty comfortable...the only thing that could have been better was the ear mesh. It didn't quite exactly line up with my ears (not surprising since not everyone has the exact same head) but that didn't make it uncomfortable."
5,prodigals,I would recommend this book to anyone who has older children who have left their faith behind. It comforts and guides that there is hope yet for them.
1,Body Type Book is Much Better,"I've purchased and read them all.This one was surprisingly the least informative.I found it similar to the others, without clear foundation and thought.I wouldn't purchase this book. The Body Type Book is a much better buy."
2,tolerable,"Much of what I have said about the Winged Assassin (see my review) could be repeated here. The plotting is excellent and the pace of the story very good but Ms Cooke's writing is obnoxiously dull, her characters sadly lacking and many points could have been developed much better.This second volume of the trilogy, though, shows a little more care: the main character is better rounded and I managed to find him nearly endearing; the author seems also to decide that he is homosexual, after all, and she pays a little more attention to his love for Sasha.A trilogy to pick up if you are interested in gay themed fantasy fiction and you find the three volumes in some second hand book store for a very low price."
5,Great blade,"I put this blade in a 4 1/2"" angle grinder with a blade guard. I used it to make some intricate cuts in laminate flooring I installed (trim around doors and stair case). It made fast, clean cuts. The 14K max RPM means there aren't many applications it can't handle. The best part is that after all that laminate I threw at it (the stuff really dulls blades), it's still plenty sharp."
5,Just what I needed,The blade fits my porter cable 314 with the reducer bushing and added new life to my saw.I tryed the diablo on a 7 1/4 and I have been very happy with them.
5,"Here i found what i needed, thanks!","I trust a lot to buy in amazon.com, I already been here for over 3 years buying tools and allways I found What I was looking for and good prices!I used paypal to paid all! another good deal!"
5,great,Good job irwin this model is great. It is so durable!!! U can move almost any part of his body and he is awsomly detailed.
5,great,Good job irwin this model is great. It is so durable!!! U can move almost any part of his body and he is really detailed.I am the most diehard dbz fan in the world really!!! And this model is the best model ever. I like gundam but this model stays together better than gundam models do. Get this model right now. It is the greatest!!!!!!!!-Pat
1,Don't expect decent delivery slow slow slow,"I ordered this and didn't know the delivery time was up to 4 weeks to ship a DVD. WARNING; Don't expect delivery in less than 3 to 4 weeks, which, for Amazon's is awful. Amazon marketplace order. WARNING: DELIVERY TIMES STINK! Watch out for Thermite Media. Their positive reviews are basically half liners that say how great they are with no other linked reviews. Probably self congratulations. If you order from Thermite Media, expect to wait a month before you get simple things. SLOW SLOW SLOW"
3,Corny but effective,"This video is a little corny (okay, it's a LOT corny), but it is very inspiring to see these seniors working out with weights. Clyde does a good job explaining the exercises and their benefits, and there is a music and old time video interlude while you do the reps. Sometimes there is TOO much time for the reps, and sometimes there isn't enough and you wish you could stop it so you can continue the exercise before moving on. Probably not the best video of this kind, but I think it was the first and Clyde should get some credit for showing older people that fitness is still achieveable."
4,I loved these movies as a child.,I saw these movies when I was little and loved them. I got them for my grandchildren I hope to have someday so they can enjoy them too.
3,One Disney Classic One Disney throw away,"Being a kid in the mid 1970's I had seen at least ten Disney movies in the theaters back in the day. When I saw this dvd for sale a couple of years ago I bought it thinking how great it would be to see both movies again. I enjoyed the first one remembering Tony & Tia being my age at the time wondering what they are doing now. It's a cute little story with some suspense at least for a 10 year old. But when I saw the second one I was disappointed to see some misfit kids stealing the show and Tony being in a trance through 90% of the movie. You also have two Super stars (Bette Davis and Christopher Lee)in the movie. I ask you ""Why are they in this corny movie?"" This is one of the worst sequels next to Caddy Shack 2. Buy it only for the first movie, Escape to Witch Mountain."
4,The two-for is a great deal,"I was excited to see that I could purchase these two classics in one. Great nostalgia for those- like myself- who grew up watching these movies. I favor the sequel, but they are both delightful memories."
4,A quick and absorbing read,"This is a fun short novel that is one of those stories where you read it quickly because its quite engaging and has a breathless pace to it. I have read a few of Herbert's books and this is one of his better ones for sure. The menacing rats are described in imaginative terms, and with good horror scenes in it. The ending is kind of lame though, and not as good as the rest of the book. Overall this is an enjoyable snack size thriller-horror story."
1,There Is No God,"Absolutely horrible. Unbelievable characters, lame plot and ho-hum prose. This novel reads like it was written in one draft with no rewrites. Thank goodness it only cost 99 cents at a library sale. No wonder they were eager to unload it. . . ."
4,"from ""The Blue Divide"" Volume 1 Issue 1, by Mike Ramirez","Conni St.Pierre is no stranger to the world of ambience. She's been on board since 1981, and continues to construct great underrated ambient recordings. As a classically trained piano, flute, and vocalist (although this is an instrumental album), she utilizes all of her skills to perform a quiet, yet outdoors-like experience. The listener is engulfed in Conni's mood-setting performance, and left there to decide where to journey to next. This album was created mainly for her interest in myths and legends. The press release states that while she was recording this album, she found a reference to the ""Lost City of Is"" in a book she read. With her connection with a scholar from the Internet, she began to uncover many of the lost city legends while creating this album. This is music for relaxing, studying (yes, I said studying), or to fall asleep to. The latter will only make you miss out on the experience Conni has to offer."
5,All the best stuff really *is* made in Japan...,"I don't speak a lick of Japanese, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this CD. The songs are catchy, ranging in style from pop love ballad to high-energy rock and everything in between. Rest assured, it's well worth your yen."
4,Vitamin D3,"I have been taking this daily, for about 6 months. I could only find this product online. So far so good."
4,vitamin D3 capsules,The product appears to be just as advertised. No problems encountered and shipping was prompt.
5,Vit D for older people,"Scientific evidence suggest that western populations are severely defficient in this vitamin, and the problem gets worse with age...Do yourself a favor and get a bottle. It should be safe to take Vit D up to 10,000 IU a day (disclaimer: ask your doctor, etc.)."
5,The Number One Missed supplement,"It is said that 3 out of 4 people don't have enough Vitamin D in their blood. Actually Life Extension tested about 200 thousand of their members that were already taking this supplement and found that 80% were under the minimum amount needed. For best results your blood count should be from 50 to 80 on a scale of 35 to 100. Only D3 gets into the body in the form that is ready to use. I myself tested four times over a year period and found I too was short, so I kept adding more. I take over 10,000 units per day and have taken 17,000. My count isn't yet to 50. I know people that take 40,000 a day and are medical professionals. Scary but this ingredient acts as a hormone and every cell in your body has a receptor for Vit D. Life Extension also has a liquid version which I like. Get serious about this inexpensive supplement for your bones and to deter the big ""C""."
3,Vitamin D-3,I appreciate the convenience of 5000 IU's in one capsule. The results are real and I feel much better since taking them.This is a great product.
3,For right handed users only,"While it is well built and works (though slower than traditional hand held openers), EZ Squeeze is intended to be used in the right hand. Not a big deal unless you don't have a useable right hand.oh well the search continues for a opener for me."
4,"I love them, please get more!","These apple sauce pouches are fabulous. We discovered them while traveling in France and they are EVERYWHERE. My personal favorite, however, is the Pom'Pote brand - dozens of apple/other fruit combos.Why is there no version of this made in the states? They are easy to travel with, easy to eat and my kids LOVE them. The Delis brand is great, but smaller in size per pouch than the Pom'Pote - with fewer fruit flavor options."
1,Ultra isn't always better,"Prior to the purchase of Kodak's Ultra Premium Photo Paper, I had always used Kodak's Premium Photo Paper. I was very happy with the quality of the Premium paper, so I thought the Ultra would be that much better. Wrong. I have tried printing several different images that were taken in different settings (flash, no flash, etc), and the quality of all the images came out poor using the Ultra paper. The images were much darker and almost muted. I plan to go back to the Premium paper."
4,Kodak high gloss photo paper.,Unfortunately it is of such high quality that there are times it gets caught in the printer. It is just a little too thick but when it works the pictures are beautiful.
5,Music to Touch Your Heart,Almost nothing touches me more than Martin Sherwin's music. It comes from the core of his being and it touches mine and then I know more peace and more inspiration than words can convey. He lets his heart weave into his playing and there is more delight in the world because of it!
5,Simply relaxing piece of music. Soothes the senses.,"Martin Sherwin's music is a nature lover's work of art. It is relaxing, and yet encourages the senses to go into the depths of imagination. You have to hear it to believe it."
1,Way too BIG...,"While the description of this product does list it as oversized, I assumed it meant it was wider to accommodate more pens. Wrong, it means the holder is so tall that you have to dive down to fish out a pen. While it looks nice, not at all functional in my opinion."
3,Good Fantasy Adventure from Taiwan,"You get it all...Tiger Wasps, Fruit Tree Maidens, Demon Lizards, the Silver Scale Serpent, Herb Wanderers, Flying Vampire Demons and fireflies. This fun fantasy adventure is a good popcorn flick. If you don't speak the native language, be sure to set the sound up with the English track. It may be too gory and violent for young kids...and a little scary with all of these killer creatures. 3 stars."
4,NICE ACTION FANTASY,"THIS IS AN ALL-AROUND IMPRESSIVE ACTIONER FROM THAILAND. IT'S NOT ""ONG-BAK"" BUT WORTH VIEWING"
5,There is no better examination of the Bible on this issue.,"Dr. Bilezikian looks at all the passages of Scripture that deal with the issue of Women's roles. Starting with creation and the desired relationship men and women were intended to have. The results of the fall to that relationship. How Jesus and the New Testament Church are intended to restore the created order.Not only through the examination of the texts but through confronting actual current interpertations of those texts, Bilezikian provides a challenging and indicting examination of the current belief held by many conservative or fundemental Christians. Bilezikian remains Faithful to the orthodox Christian Faith and unwavering in the belief of the Authority of scripture, which make his book a must read no matter what you believe concerning this issue.But be forwarned this will challenge your beliefs and may cause you to change your outlook or confirm what in your heart you have known to be true."
1,Twists & distorts scripture,"For example:translates ""kephale""/""head"" as ""source"" with next to no mandate from scripture for this reading.Gives Athaliah ""and others"" as an example of a woman in civil authority.Gives the example of Abraham obeying Sarah in marrying Hagar as an example of ""Abraham obeying his wife"".Makes a reference to Adam as a ""baboon with a banana"" at the fall.Excuses Eve from the fall as having only heard of the ban on the tree via ""hearsay"" from Adam.Dismisses the ban on women speaking in 1 Cor 14 as a Pauline quote of the Judaizers.Relegates the ban on woman teachers in 1 Tim 2 to a ban on ""bad"" teachers.I suggest you read this book and ""Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood"" and compare the two.Dale"
1,Does not provide an doctrinal view of gender relations.,"When I first saw the book, I thought that it would give a biblical view of how scripture dictates gender's roles and responsibilities. I was very disappointed to find out that the views are distorted and have no foundational truth. It presents a ""very"" liberal view of this understanding of theology. Not a good tool for those wanting to know what the bible say."
1,do your research,"Do your homework, and read what the other side has to say. As Prov 18:17 tells us, ""The first to present his case seems right, till another comes forward and questions him."" VERY true.There has been a strong attempt to ""revise"" the plain meaning of Scripture to make it different than it is. If you do NOT read up on this issue, but ONLY read the new ""let's FIX the Bible"" side, you can be deceived.READ THIS, twice over: ""Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism""edited by John Piper and Wayne GrudemTHIS WOMAN'S VIEW: ""Women and the Word of God: A Response to Biblical Feminism"" by Susan T. Foh""The Excellent Wife: A Biblical Perspective""by Martha Peace""Me? Obey Him?: The Obedient Wife and God's Way of Happiness and Blessing in the Home"" by Elizabeth Rice Handford""The Surrendered Wife : A Practical Guide to Finding Intimacy, Passion, and Peace with Your Man"" by Laura Doyle"
5,"An easy-to-read, eye-opening classic",An intellectually serious piece of work and an excellent survey on what the bible says about men and women. Arguments based on detailed and careful analysis of biblical text and context; well thought out and convincing. Presentation very organized and easy to follow. A definite must-read on the topic. Warning: Set aside your preconceptions and open your mind (whether liberal or traditional) before you open the book - or any book on the topic.
1,(i wold like this movie to) Die! Die! Die!,pretty horrible excuse for a action movie the plot is flimsy and i couldn't even finish it just look at the horrible title and you will already know what i mean
3,More Beautiful Music,"This is a very good CD. If you have purchased all the other Yanni CD's, there is really no need to purchase this one. It's kind of a recap of all the others. I enjoyed it and I'm not sorry I bought it, but it wasn't needed."
3,For those new to Yanni,"If you already have Yanni DVDs then leave this alone, unless you want to hear him talking over the best parts of some of his best music clips. On the other hand if you are new to Yanni then this is a good taster to what you have been missing."
1,UGH!,"Myself and 10 other friends read this book - no one liked it. It reads like a textbook - names, dates, etc. Subject sounded interesting, but none of us was up for a boring history lesson, which is what this book was like. Sorry, can't recommend it."
1,Irwin could improve,Unlike bandais full action kits irwins dont show as much detail as the original japenese ones I collect
4,Fun read.,"Fun read, especially for those who have been there. The author writes well, and is fairly easy to follow. Interesting, with an accurate portrayal of living with the disorder."
5,"""Boundary Power"" is an excellent tool","I disagree with the perspective expressed by a few others that this book is too Christian oriented. It contains very little Christian content and this can be skipped if desired without taking away from the rest of the book. Perhaps the book ""Boundaries"" by Drs Henry Cloud and John Townsend has been mistaken for ""Boundary Power."" In fact, ""Boundary Power"" discusses abusive religious systems and practices that violate personal boundaries.I am a mental health counselor, and I find that many of my clients have unhealthy boundaries that cause them to be taken advantage of or be victimized. This book points out what boundaries are, where we learn them, and why they are necessary. It gives numerous examples of both healthy and unhealthy boundaries while guiding the reader to examine their own boundaries and to develop. I recommend it."
3,Wish I'd known it was a religious approach,"This book is reasonably helpful, but I wish I'd realized before buying it that it uses a Christian perspective."
5,Amazing,"I also just discovered Keith Waa on Dr. Bronner's Magic Soapbox documentary. Wow, what an incredible emotional expression. It communicates more than words are capable of. I wish I could find more modern day music by Keith Waa. Anyone know of other instances of his work? This CD is from 1997 apparently."
2,Not What You Think It Is,"I have been studying handwriting as a hobby for many years, and I found this little book, with its pert little one or two word descriptions for many handwriting strokes, to be inaccurate as well as too general. Many descriptions do not agree with the majority of the handwriting experts that have written other books on this subject. The only useful info I found in this book was about doodles."
4,"Chess on the ""GO""",Excalibur's LCD Chess computer is a nice littleproduct. Many levels of play and some classicgames as well. Although not the strongest opponent(1600 elo) this computer runs on 3AAA batteries formonths .... pick one up and you will be hard pressedto put it back down.
1,I think I need glasses,(...) its hard to see the white figers. Were there like any why into day computer age to make the white figer just a little darker for us kids. Im sorry mom i should have not let you buy me this cheap chess game.
2,It's hard to tell the pieces apart.,"It's hard to tell the pieces apart; they invented their own weird symbology instead of using the standard 'newspaper icon' pieces you see in books.Also, it's not that strong (1750? pschh!). Other than that, though, it's small, convenient, and durable."
1,How To Teach Your Baby To Be Physically Superb: From Birth To Age Six; The Gentle Revolution,I have not received this item
5,Body and brain are tightly coupled,"The main issue of this book is that mental and physical development of a baby are tightly coupled. Physically perfect body gives more blood, oxygen and energy to the brain which reinforces the development of the body, which is most obvious for ages up to 36 months.The author splits the development of the brain and the body to seven stages depending on age, and gives methods and joyful exercises for a baby to be physically superb."
5,Enchanting,"Sherwin's music will put you in the moment. Watch out, you may loose track of the time as the gentle sounds carry your worries away. I have to be aware of the time or run the risk of loosing hours on tasks, although the task gets accomplished, usually better than expected. If you have the chance to see him live you are in for a treat. I have seen him at festivals and his songs have enchanting effect."
5,Incredible Book on Marriage,"Mike Mason has a way with taking God's Word on marriage and making it real for today. Marriages today can be as beautiful and as spiritual as he describes. I loved reading his book and learning how to make my marriage to my wonderful gift of a man, my husband, the very best it can be. A spirtual union made by God."
2,Didn't know where it was going...,"The Mrs. and I picked this up a couple weeks ago as our most recent joint read book. Unfortunately we didn't get engaged in it and eventually quit reading. It seemed impossible to understand te tangible premise of where the book was going with all the metaphors. In looking at the reviews, it obviously worked for some people, but for us it was just too ambiguous. We stopped half way through."
3,Just Okay,"The author jam packs about 96 pages of content into 224 pages. His message is quite simple and utlimately very helpful, however; the authors extended metaphors and comments are a bit overdone. Sacred Marriage by Gary Thomas is a better written and more thoughtful book that covers the same topics."
1,Best of the Best,"This book takes you where most books on marriage and relationship never take you. One of the problems with ""help and guidance"" books is that most never really address the roots and foundations that experience and life are really built upon. Mike addresses the essentials in a very artistic manner that draws you in and causes you embrace those mysterous truths about marriage and the relationship between a man and woman that most of us miss, unless we are willing to pursue the depths. Include some ""practical"" books on marriage, but don't leave this one out of your ""must read and apply"" library."
2,A Disappointment,"My husband and I received this book as a wedding present and began reading it with great interest. We were very disappointed. I found it to be a perfect example of overwriting and overuse of adjectives. We also were surprised that in a book about marriage, the topic of family and children barely came up. Surely a book that's advertised as a comprehensive resource about marriage (one quote on the back says it's the only book you'll ever need to read on the subject) should address one of the most profound, mysterious, and challenging aspects of marriage--becoming a family and raising children together. As a resource on marriage and family, I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,AWESOME BOOK,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It painted a very different, but yet real picture of the marital relationship and how it parallels our own personal relationship with Almight God. I wish more people had an understand of what it truly means to love someone. We would have a lower divorce rate.This book has challenged me in my own marriage. On a daily basis it causes me to reflect on whether or not I am loving my wonderful husband or if I am protecting myself and seeking my own desires.In a culture where we are taught to only think about our personal happiness, this book is a breath of fresh air. Every married couple or someone thinking about marriage should definatley read this book."
2,not so good quality for pet bird,I bought for my pet GCC's little snackbut this one is not so great and my GCC did not like too muchso i just gave to out side birds.
2,Somewhat I think the fault of the design,"I used this PQI 2GB SD 133X on my Canon SD450 digital. The card tend to be stuck to the slot when I ejecting it. I have to use the tweezers in order to pull it out. I think because the of PQI designed. One side of the card, the plastic is not smooth--therefore it tend to be stuck . My other 2 cards I have is Sandisk and Canon, I don't have any trouble ejecting them. But only this PQI, hence give it a 2 stars. Have tweezers nearby if you need to ejecting this card out ."
1,Went bad after a few months,"I bought this card about two months ago; at first, I was really impressed. It had a higher speed (x133 vs. x40) than my last card; the difference was notable especially when filming 1024 res videos with my Canon S80. Tonight, I go to take a picture and get a ""Bad Memory"" error. First I tried reformatting the card; the camera was unable to complete that operation. I put the card in a USB adapter and tried to reformat it via Windows. That failed as well. I'm not even able to erase the current pictures from it; they show up in Windows explorer, but cannot be erased. I appears that the card has died. Sadly, I probably don't have the receipt anymore. I've used a lot of Compact Flash and a few SD cards in the last 5 years; this is the first one that's gone bad on me."
4,A Classic Fantasy Cake with Extra Author Insight Icing!,"The best parts of the Annotated Chronicles?? When Tracy Hickman writes a note about a particular item in the book, and then right below it, Margaret Weis also includes a note and basically contradicts with Tracy says! I love the playful rapport between them!I am positively boggled as to how a book can be co-authored by two (or more) people in a collaborative, fictional linear-story setting, and this Annotated Chronicles really does shed a lot of light in the writing and thought process of creating and writing these epic books! I love behind the scenes stuff like that! It's like watching the ""Making Of"" extras in DVDs!Warning: THE BOOK IS HEAVY. I've been using it as a commuting-on-the-train and a working-out-at-the-gym book and it really is an added burden! But I don't mind!Also, if you have never read the books, the annotations on the sides will be VERY distracting, not to mention spoiler-y!"
3,Annotated or not....,"After reading a lot of reviews about how bad the annotated chronicles were compared to the original, I think a lot people forget the main point behind it. This book was put together for those who, in my opinion, should have already read the books, and wanted to know little tid bits about certain things. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but try to keep in mind the POINT behind this edition.If you don't want to know that this and that is going to cause something in the book (even though you already know) or I already knew that. Then fine don't read it, but if you still want to know things and understand a little more, then read it.Don't bash the book just because it's not your reading standard."
3,Great Memories,"Read these books when they first cam out, when I was in seventh grade. Never kept up with the rest of the series, but I consider these to be classics. This is a beautiful volume and would be worth the price if only to have the books in hardcover. The annotations and illustrations are a great bonus. If you're a fan at all, add this edition to your collection."
5,One of the best Sci Fi/Fantasy series ever just got better,"I've read the Dragonlance Chronicles 12 times in the last 10 years. I'm always amazed by it, and I thoroughly enjoy myself every time. Now, with annotaions, you get inside the authors' perspective when they wrote this tale. There are humorous anecdotes and linguistic studies, and some nice color inserts of Dragonlance early artwork. I highly reccommend this to anyone who likes this genre of fiction!"
2,Marketing Hype,"I loved the original Dragonlance Chronicles when it first came out, and I am thoroughly enjoying reading it again. However, the annotated part is a joke. Not only are the comments generally inane, a clear plug for another book, or a detraction from the expereice of reading this story a second time. It's been awhile sense I read it originally and I was finding it very enjoyable to see the story unfolding again. Then along comes an annotation that reveals way to much about Fizban early in the story. Arrgh! To their credit, there are a few comments that lend insight into how characters were developed and how the whole project worked as a collaborative effort. All in all, I would suggest you simply go to your local used bookstore and get the original paperbacks. They are worth reading again and again."
5,The authors in your home!,"Have you ever wanted to get into the author's head just a little bit further? Or to rent them for a few hours and ask them questions? Well here you go...your wish had been granted...well sort of...well its the next best thing!The Annotated Chronicles is chalk full of further detail of everything from plots, history, the why's and where's, who did whats, etc. In this wide margin addition of the Chronicle Margaret Weis (Author)and Tracy Hickman (Author) have invited us to the realms of their creation with lots of notes added in the margins.So whether you are a seasoned vetrean or a first timmer I highly recommend The Annotated Chronicles version of the Dragonlance Chronicles! Buy it today from Amazon.com"
4,A Truly Classic Book,"I have read through all of the reviews listed, and I am happy to know so many feel as I do about the DragonLance series. The annotations proved very helpful, and felt like you were sitting around a table discussing the books with a couple of close friends. At times Ms. Black's comments did get a teeny bit on the inane side, but overall I found it added even more to the experience. As for some people thinking that there were way too many ""plugs"" for other novels, if they hadn't been there I wouldn't have ever known about the next book in the Raistlin Chronicles! All I can say is that I hope they quickly follow this up with an annotated Legends!"
4,A Look Inside a great Trilogy,"After getting this book, I could not set it down. It is great being able to get Tracy's and others thoughts while reading this book. If you ever have a chance to meet him or Margaret, make sure you do so! Their personality comes out a little in the comments of this book, but it is always better to see them in person!"
2,A good story spoiled,"In the category Non-Tolkien Fantasy, the DragonLance story may very well be as good as it gets. I'll give them that. The story is epic, the characters are great and the writing is elegant. BUT:For a first-time reader (like myself), the annotations in this edition ruin the thrill. If you don't want to know the identity of a mysterious, recurring character, have the death of important characters prematurely announced or have your reading flow interrupted by lame remarks about whose wife some character is named after, don't buy this book.If you can't resist having the trilogy nicely wrapped in one hardcover edition, take the book to the basement before starting to read, flip out your chainsaw and remove 2 inches from all pages."
1,Great book; terrible annotations,"If you have not read these books and are the type of person to jump right to the last page, then this is the book for you. Tracy and Margaret have a terrific knack of hinting towards the next 100-150 pages with their little side blurbs. I cannot begin to tell you how many annotations begin with, ""as we discover later..."" It's like a cruel joke.I am on page 500 of this 1300 page book. At about page 300 I resolved to stop reading the sidebars. Unfortunately, when they place an asterick within the text and place a little one or two sentence blurb right beside it, before you know it you have already read it. Tracy and Margaret do a wonderful job of systematically destroying any suspense left in the book. If they would join my poker table, I could quit my day job.Read the books, they are quite good. Get versions without the annotations, they are quite bad."
5,A Fantasy Masterpiece,"After Lord of The Rings, this trilogy is the world's bestseller fantsy books. If you haven't read it yet, just give it a chance. this hardcover, of course, includes all of the trilogy. the most important thing about this book is, writer's comments. a suggestion: if you are reading the trilogy for the first time, don't read the comments, imho. they will be more valuable after you finished all the book."
4,Revisting,"I first read the Chronicles when they first came out 15 years ago when I was in high school. I just finished reading the Annotated Chronicles. While the story remains as captavating as ever, I discovered huge holes in the plot line that my original eye failed to notice years ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the comments made by Ms. Weis and Mr Hickman. Seeing the development of the story set to such a huge background is really interesting. The only comments that really intruded on the story were those by the editor, Ms. Black That's why I gave this edition 4 stars. Her comments start out good (several recaps of parts edited out of the original text) but degenerate into comments that treat the reader like a simpleton, especially those familiar with Krynn and AD&D. If you have not read the Chronicles, DO NOT read this edition. It will spoil the fun."
3,Good..... for 20 dollars.,"So you get what you get for $20. I would only recommend it to those who like the 45. It's not too accurate and doesn't have much distance (30ft), but for collecting it's not a bad grab."
3,not specific and missing target,"It says here that this gun comes with a target but it did not. Also, directions are very vague, i am new to airsoft, but i know what a hop up system is and i cant find it on the gun. Safety is also useless, if there is a bb in the chamber and the gun is cocked, pulling the trigger even with the safety on fires it, there is now a nice little hole in my wall.Finally can somebody comment and answer a question i have about this gun: Is it supposed to fire only one shot at a time? since im new to spring guns i dont know if this is a flaw or just normal. Thanks!"
4,christmas present for my son,"This product came on time, packaged very well. Good BB gun for the price. My son will love it! Overall I give this product a good review."
2,Flaw,"When I started to shoot my airsoft gun, a stress crack formed in the slide.. I would only recommend this as a show piece, not a shooting piece"
4,Kind of small but great!,I didn't realize how small it was until i got but i love it! Its small enough that you can still tell what it is but not large enough to weight your neck down! Its also great quality the chain is really great! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a durable nice looking necklace.
2,this books ok,"I thought this book was going to have advanced info on basic tattwas, but it didn't. It went into how to make different types, or your on tattwas for meditation. This book had a lot on magical squares."
3,A Okay Head,"I originally bought this for time lapse shooting. However, it turns too fast, and it doesn't have many options for controlling the movement."
1,Not smooth. Very jerky.,"No matter what camera you put on it, the motion is not fluid it has a slight jerk. If it was $99 bucks or less I'd keep it but at the $130 I paid just not worth it."
5,Very Handy! can't beat the price,"this may not be the best for moving and recording at the same time, it could use a slower/smoother movement, but what can you expect for the price? its a lot cheaper than the thousands other ones go for. at church we have several cameras around the sanctuary but no one to run them, with this you can move them around from one location and use the video switcher to be feeding a stationary shot while changing the view of another. we have a splitter to view what the camera sees along with a remote for zooming, recording and power. its a great product, and the variable speed with 360 degree movement makes it so you can quickly move around to capture different things and then slow it back down for finer adjustments."
2,Worked for 10 months.,Purchased December 2008. Used to charge telephones and other small wattage devices. This month the voltage went below 100 volts and was not able to recharge anything.
4,Great product.,"Used for trip from Texas to Yellowstone and back, to power laptop computer & phone charger in a 2009 Toyota Camry and it worked great. Fan came on every now and then, while in back floorboard, but not loud or annoying."
1,Does not provide enough power for laptop without the car engine running.,I tried using this inverter on both a sedan and a mini-van. It cannot even provide the needed power for a single laptop. I must have the engine running in order to use it. This inverter is simply useless.
2,"Not what I expected, also had a fan","This unit arrived with a broken car-adapter cord. Not sure if this means it was cheap (probably) or was a really old unit that had sat in storage for a long time. Also, it appeared to have a small fan, something I'd been trying to avoid.Instead, I ended-up purchasing a similar looking model in-store someplace. It was another ""400W"" model and cost more ($60) but I was able to confirm beforehand that it had no fan. Sorry, can't remember the brand or model."
5,Perfect for Travel,Purchased this item for a family road trip vacation. I was able to keep my laptop running as a DVD player for the kids and keep my digital camera and cell phones charged. I didn't experience any problems. This item was a great value!
1,Didnt work for me,Every time I plug it in - it just makes a loud whistling noise after 2 minutes and won't work. Useless - cant really use it for anything. Worked fine for 1 month and now its like this. Maybe I just got a bad piece!
4,Xantrex Xpower Plus 400 W Inverter,The inverter works as advertised and the priced is fair. I use it to run a laptop computer on my boat. The only negative is the noise produced by the fans.I would recommend this product to a friend.
5,Works great,Very happy with this product - have used it in the car to run computer and other electronics.
5,Does what it should,"I used this with a Macbook pro in my car while driving across the US. This model is best of both since it comes with both a cigarette adapter, and direct connection cables with the battery. The fan turns on and off, but is quite silent and isn't noticeable."
4,Works....,"Item works as described,the built in cooling fan seems to run more as the battery gets lower (12.24v) even under small load.but it is not very loud.great for small backup power..."
5,"Sturdy, inexpensive power for the car!","We use this inverter to power devices like laptops and CD players in the car. It works great every time and gets a lot of use on long rides.My only complaint was the two outlets right next to each other. One of our devices has a wide adapter plug that covers the other outlet when plugged in.A minor inconvenience.This is a nice, solid way to get electricity for low-draw items in the car. I didn't have to buy a DVD player. Just use this inverter with my laptop (15"" screen) and run DVDs as long as I want for the kids."
5,Inverter,This power inverter works great. I've had it now for over a year. Use it everyday and it's still running strong. I recommend this to a friend.
4,Xantrex Technologies 851-0400 X-Power 400 Power Inverter,"A little bulky, but does the job it was designed for."
1,Like screaming kids,"Purchased unit with intend of running a portable DVD player for the kids, and a peaceful trip for me. Instead I got the opposite, as soon as I plugged the unit into Power Port I blew two 20 AMP fuses (on 2004 F-150) so I did the dumbest thing I wired it to the battery and short the battery out. So I'm out a battery and inverter at this point. Take my warning DO NOT BUY this piece of junk, you'll feel better giving a homeless person $32.19 instead of dealing with disappointed kids."
5,Was not big enough,Was not enough watts to run my Nebulizer. I had to order it from the people that sold me my Nebulizer
4,Power inverter used on long trips....,"Purchased the inverter for a trip to Florida to power two laptops. Other reviewers were spot on in their assessments that it will not power two devices if they are near full discharge. We found that if the laptops started with a full charge, that the inverter would extend their usage by several hours, but if the batteries were low, the inverter would ""complain"" with an audible squeal. Even so, with careful planning, it was quite useful and allowed two people to watch separate movies or play computer games, etc."
4,power converter special,"This unit is very quiet and efficient. It does exactly what it was advertised to do, it is great for my comuter and charging applications."
4,Get the 700 watter,"Real nice unit, but I wish I had bought the Xantrex 700 watt unit instead. For instance, I have a small auto vacuum that need 6 amps. This unit won't handle it. This unit can attach to the cigarette lighter or directly to the battery. The 700 watt unit skips the lighter input -- fine with me but maybe not with you. If you need lighter input then get the 400 watt unit. I will say that the inverter is well built and designed. I like the fact that the power input leads are attached via screw posts. This lets you modify it as needed, for instance if you needed longer leads, you could make your own and not have to kludge it."
4,excellent product,"Pros:Many - work well according to my expectations. Low heat and its fan rarely ran with my laptop plugged in.Cons:In cold winter (<0C) in the car, turning on the inverter will show a flashing fault light and there will be no AC output. However, as the car interior warm up (may take 15 minutes), the inverter starts to work.I believe it's an issue caused by extreme cold. Maybe some components changes under the extreme cold, thus trigger a fault.The downside is that you can't play or use it for the first 15-20 minutes of the drive."
4,Does the job,"Have used the inverter on a couple 2-hour trips. Ran a Dell laptop and video game chargers off it the whole time with no problems. Only possible issue is a whine introduced into the car stereo (aux input) from a laptop running off the inverter. In other words, I was running the laptop off the inverter and plugged the laptop's headphone output into the car stereo's auxiliary input and there was a noticeable whine coming out of the speakers. It didn't affect the operation of the stereo, laptop or inverter, and the inverter still works fine. The only other note is that running the inverter with the car engine off causes the inverter fan to run at full speed, which is rather loud. The inverter fan does not normally come on when the car engine is running."
1,No replacement part,I have a Xantrx 400 powerpack. Misplaced air hose. Xantrex does not stock replacement parts. Very poor policy. Would never buy from a company again that does not provide parts or service on all it's models.
4,Time traps that rob opportunity,"After 30 years of self-employed selling this book is a great ""tune up"" about task management and becoming more efficient with time and talent."
3,Shows promise,"It is always difficult to do justice to a book and author when you start in the middle of an established series. (On the other hand, shouldn't each book in a series be able to stand on its own?) This intallment obviously draws on characters and situations more thoroughly developed in earlier stories. So I really didn't feel I knew enough about the characters, just from this book alone, to empathise with their predicament and understand their motivations. Also, the shamanic/Pan theme was quite over-emphasised and distracting and not too well juxtaposed with the other techno theme. However, the Willa Jansson character has intrigued me sufficiently to want to explore at least one more of the books in this series."
3,altered states,"reluctant lawyer, willa jansson, is diverted from her first day at her new job when she spots one of her parents' septuagenarian friends weilding a gun on a busy downtown sidewalk. as usual the theme is off-beat:mysticism meets cybernetics. more detective than legal fiction."
1,Caddy is very small and customer service with this seller is awful,"The Caddy in ""real life"" is much smaller than the picture would lead you to believe. But the worst of it is that the seller only shipped 1 of the caddies but billed me for 2. I have been trying desperately to get the problem resolved without much success. I finally had to file a claim with Amazon. So, while the caddy is small than expected, I think my real issue is with the seller. Stay far away from this seller. This has been the worst customer service.... EVER!"
1,Flimsy--do not order,Product is flimsy & will not hold heavy shampoo bottles. My item arrived bent and broken. I returned & did not ask for replacement
4,Not Bad,"This Caddy works well and holds alot of items. Ive had others that would tip over, but this one does not. The down side is that it can get pretty nasty underneath if you don't move it out of the way and clean it regularly. Like anything metal you buy for the shower, it will rust over time, though I had mine for about a year before I saw any rust on it. All in all, I kept it for about two years and was satisfied. If you want to make it last longer, you might want to spray some rustolium on it and keep it out of the direct stream of water."
5,Two coats of clear Rustoleum have kept this looking brand new,"I bought this a few months ago, and, before using it, followed some advice I had been given for a previous shower caddy, which was to spray it before using with some clear Rustoleum. I gave it two coats (one coat each day, for two days), and let them dry. We live on the coast, where things rust and get moldy pretty quickly, but so far it's been holding up great.This caddy is really great. I have a ridiculous amount of hair and shower products, and this holds them all. It has a small footprint, and the metal has a nice design so that it looks nicely made, and not cheap at all.It also sits nice and flat on our shower floor, which is composed of very small 4x4"" tiles; it doesn't wobble or move at all.Overall, a fantastic purchase!"
2,Disappointed,"This book is appropriate for second thru sixth graders. I ordered it for a 17 year old for Christmas and was disappointed. The content repeatedly states the obvious: ""Extreme skateboarders like to try new, difficult tricks.""I feel this information should have been stated in the descripton. Extreme Skateboarding does have great photos. It is a small book."
3,Extreme Skateboarding,"My book is about skateboarding. The author is Pat Ryan. He writes books about sports like snowboarding, rock climbing, and of course skateboarding, and that is what this book is about. It tells about skateboarding equipment, competitions, and safety. It also tells about professionals, amateurs, and beginners. It tells how skateboarding was started. It shows how the old boards, wheels, and trucks looked like. It has a glossary that tells what some of the words mean. This nonfiction book really tells you a lot of information. If you want to know what skateboarding is. Then this is the book for you."
5,great book that teaches when one really wins,"I bought this book for my 5-year old son and a second one for his classroom at day care. I was saddened to see how early in life children become competitive, and tried to express the many complicated topics around competition (that winning is not everything, the value of the experience is most important, you can lose and still have achieved something) and feel that this book meant more to my son than all my hours of explanations. I am grateful to Erica Silverman for writing this thoughtful book that is also very much fun to read and beautifully illustrated. I HIGHLY recommend it to any parent whose child has become sad or frustrated at losing. This book will make them laugh while they learn some important life lessons."
5,How a girl remembers.,"This book stands as one of the(many)reasons I would never try to write on my own. It's the brilliance of incomplete thoughts; halfway to coherency, the ones that slip into oblivion. What an amazing trick to get them on paper. Or to make it seem that way. Just buy it, why don't you?"
4,HE'S LEARNING TO SPELL!,"I recently purchased this puzzle for my toddler son. When I received it, I was disappointed with the small pieces and was going to send it back. I did, however, keep it because I thought the educational value may prove more important than the size of the puzzle.Boy, was I right on that! My son truly enjoys putting together these mini-puzzles and on his own. He's only two, but loves his letters and shows interest in words. He's actually learning to spell! And I love the fact that the puzzle is self-correcting; he knows a word is spelt correctly if the puzzle is complete."
1,Too many pieces,There are too many pieces to this puzzle..My son knows all his letters and can spell some words (he is 3) so I guess this was too advanced for him because the pieces were everywhere..I think this would be more beneficial if the letters were grouped in at least two to three per piece versus one puzzle piece per letter.
1,Being a Man in a Woman's World,"Very, very shallow. Would not recommend to anyone who is even a bit serious about the topic."
2,Being a Man?,"If you think dating many women makes someone a Man than this is your book, right from a sales and marketing class. If you are coming from the Robert Bly camp on being a Man you will find this book rather shallow. The advice in the book works. However, with a strong, independent identity as a Man that is seperated from our mother dominated ideals you will acheive the same results."
1,from a woman,"This may be the most entertaining thing I have read in a long time, although my frequest outbursts of laughter are clouded by pity. This may get you a woman guys, but she will surely have personal problems if she responds positively to this approach. But then, it may be a match made in heaven. BTW - The one star is for spelling."
4,milosz: saving the best for last,"The first section of this book is marvelous, transporting. His last poem is, to me, his best. All of the autobiographical and reflective material is enjoyable, but it loses something in the translation from his life to mine. It is, however, very useful in understanding what went into all of his writing. And his theological reflections have long added depth to my own.This book is well worth the price for the last poem--Orpheus and Eurydice--alone. If you have ever loved someone..."
4,Accessible poems; illuminating faith,"I normally avoid poetry because it's often inaccessible. Happily, I think I ""get"" most of Milosz's poems. As a person of Polish heritage like Milosz, I appreciate his respect for Catholicism as well as his skepticism. His healthy, but not uncritical faith is enlightening."
4,Charming,"A well-made and decorative switchplate. I gave it four stars as it seems a tiny bit smaller than the standard switchplates I replaced. However, this might be due to the rounded corners."
4,right price no problem,This product is incredibly simple. It is exactly what it looks like. It does its job well. The price is right.
3,Sometimes a bit much...,"The thought of lego-esque characters in the Gay here-and-theres of life is truly amazing. I loved most every moment of each episode in this collection. However, there were a few moments that became a bit too sordid and, how should one say, too graphic where the imagination could have simply taken over and come out with a much more satisfying conclusion to an awkward/sexual/conflict situation."
5,What a HOOT!,This series is so funny. It is difficult to describe the incredible amount of thought the writers put into making this show. Watch it and you will roll on the floor with laughter. I can't wait for season two.
4,A fun movie,Rick and Steve is a fun movie for anyone who likes gay humor. The puppets are humorous and the story lines are funny. We would recommend it.
5,what a *terrific* album.,"I cannot seem to take it out of my player. I keep wanting to listen to it ""just ooooone more time"" before I put something else in. ""I'd Like That"" is a great little song, and if AP isn't already a dirty old man, I don't know who is! Also, Easter Theater, Knights in Shining Karma and especially Green Man are super. Your Dictionary is in the tradition of Dear God, pretty bitter, but very elegant prose."
5,MODERN DAY CLASSICAL,"You need to listen to Apple Venus a few times to really appreciate the brilliant songwriting and music, but it is well worth it. XTC are one of those groups who age well."
4,Beautiful and Complicated,"I am most fond of Drums and Wires, especially the more complex, ""odd"", tunes thereon. I have been listening nonstop to Apple Venus and am enthralled with most all of it. Heavy on strings and symphonics, prominent use of trumpet and flugel horn, with a strong dose of Steve Reich. If you like the kind of music you can sink your head into, but not hum the melody, this is worth the purchase."
4,Good,"Andy Partridge isn't a particularly good orchestral arranger. Colin Moulding's two gems feel awkwardly unpretentious in the midst of Partridge's occasionally bombastic grandiosity. Nevertheless, this album is strong, quirky, and very encouraging for us die-hard XTC fans. But XTC needs another great producer like John Leckie or Todd Rundgren before they can produce another classic."
2,Sleepy.,"After several spins of this release, I finally reached the conclusion that not everything these guys do is awesome. Which is okay, too. Their mediocre songs are still pretty damn good.Fortunately, they had the good sense to release Volume 2 at about the same time, and it's an amazing, joyful aural wonder. That one, along with Skylarking, all but guarantees Andy, et al, pop genius status for another billion years.This one, try to find used for about five bucks, and you'll be happy."
3,"Good, not great says it all.","I have ten or eleven XTC CDs. I am fond of them all. But for some reason, I'm not into this CD. Maybe I've fallen out of XTC this year... dunno. I just never seem to listen to this one."
4,100+ People Cannot Be Wrong,"Let's face it, XTC should be a clapped-out punk band that no one remembers. I think their last (and only?) hit was only just in the 1980's. Why do so many people care enough to write a review? Probably because XTC have talent, intellect and touching lyrics.I like the album. It doesn't pretend to be Britpop or Portishead. It continues and extends the sounds and themes of their last 20+ years ... and does it well.Memo to XTC: can the next one please come sooner?"
4,Shows a little of what we've been missing all these years,"Thank heavens they're back, even if it is with a record produced by what sounds suspiciously like XTC-lite. This a gentle quirky record with a handful of excellent songs, not fantastically memorable, but shows the magic isn't quite dead"
3,"Not Oranges And Lemons, nor is it Skylarking&#65533;but close","Almost every XTC issue takes more than a casual listen to distill its true essense. ""Apple Venus: Volume 1"" is no different. The brilliant ""Green Man"" and ""River Of Orchids"" make this CD worthy of high ranking, while ""Frivolous"" and ""Fruitnut"" while catchy ditties, flounder and pull the effort down a notch. I would not recommend this to new XTCers, but would to those who thrive on this duo's musical prowess."
4,decent but no classic,"Being a long-time rabid fan of XTC, I am reluctant to admit that they didn't produce a single recording that was in my top 10 list of the 90s. In fact, Apple Venus I is not even in my top 10 for 1999. Apple Venus I is a very good album, but nothing I would consider a ""classic"" for all time. I played it maybe a dozen times when it first came out, but since then I haven't touched it again until just now -- there were too many other records more interesting to listen to.A few tracks on Apple Venus are incredible: ""Harvest Festival"" is gorgeous; ""Easter Theatre"" and ""River of Orchids"" evoke strong emotions in me. Mostly, though, there are decent but not extremely memorable tracks: ""I Can't Own Her"", ""Greenman"", ""The Last Balloon"" are well-done, but I had to listen to the CD again to remember how they go -- not something I usually have to do with XTC songs. The Moulding tunes are just goofy and don't seem to fit well with the rest of the album."
3,Almost too lush,"I want to say I love this album just because it's new XTC, but I dunno...my least favorite songs on ""Nonsuch"" were ""Rook"" and ""Wrapped In Grey,"" and this is almost a whole album dedicated to remaking those two songs. I admire the attempt, but at times the production is too lush for me.Having said that, there are some great tunes here that would sound great in a more diverse mix of production styles, and when ""Apple Venus Vol. II"" is finished, I plan to put both on shuffle play. ""I'd Like That"" is a wonderful pop tune, ""Knights In Shining Karma"" haunts, ""Green Man"" would rock if it wasn't for the over-the-top, almost Elton John-y orchestrations, ""Your Dictionary"" is so biting it almost belongs on ""English Settlement,"" and Colin's two tunes are hysterical.But as a lone album this is almost too much to take in one sitting. I'm glad to see Andy is trying to push himself, and after seven years any new XTC is welcome. I'm just looking forward to ""Apple Venus Vol. II."""
4,XTC is not dead yet,"They're down to two members... Do they need more than Andy? Apple Venus didn't impress on me much at first but with a few listens it got better and better, as most challenging and great albums do. There are a couple of throwaway tunes in here, so it's not quite a five-star album. Orchestration aside, now I'm anxiously awaiting the noisy side of XTC with Apple Venus 2, slated for this fall."
4,1992-1999 . . . the missing years,Seven years is far too long to wait but my initial impressions suggest that it's been worthwhile.
3,Interesting,I bought this CD and found it to be completely unlike most of XTC's earlier work. I was rather disappointed with most of the songs.
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This recording is an excellent soporific if nothing else.Normally I love it when artists of any kind (visual, musical etc.)have the mangos to re-evaluate and come up with fresh ways of expressing themselves. But this recording really does not sound to me to be ""fresh"", the boys are sounding tired and they recycle a lot of their trademark ideas.There are brief glimpses here and there of how amazing they are/have been as composers but they are few and far between. There are only two incredible moments of inventive and evocative brilliance: River of Orchids and Greenman. That'd be about it."
2,No no no,"What is this? Beatles on peyote? Those who speak of lush beauty aren't completely bonkers -- there are lots of layers here, there's just nothing substantial under all that flaky pastry. At times the music is lovely. Mostly, it's just silly. Imagine this CD as the soundtrack to an HB cartoon and you'll get the idea. Puff'n'stuff indeed. Listening to this, it's clear XTC isn't without talent or vision. Perhaps what they needed was a sober producer."
1,After 7 years' wait: a total disappointment.,"I had been listening to XTC since ""English Settlement"". I liked some of their earlier work, and saw them improving with every album. ""Nonsuch"" is a great album, and after waiting 6 or 7 years for their next CD, when this piece of ship came out, I was one of the first buyers. Couldn't wait to play it.... I thought... these guys must have spent the last 5 years listening to Charly Garcia records, because this garbage could not possibly be that bad under no drugs! The selling price for this album says it all: under a dollar, compare it to Skylarking, English Settlement, or Nonsuch, and you'll see why some people are as eager to sell this CD online as quickly as possible. Unfortunately I wasted almost twenty bucks- on this CD, no used record shop would take it, so I threw it under the subway tracks. The rats can keep it. One of them replied to my review unfavorably."
1,I threw away my autographed copy - and I was a huge XTC fan!,XTC has been going steadily downhill since Oranges & Lemons. This album is the end of Andy Partridge's songwriting career and easily one of the worst albums I've every tried to listen to in my life. Not a single good song on the album -mostly redundant retreads of songs Andy already wrote when he could still write. Not even for the hardest core of fans.
4,Swords,"This show follows commercial fisherman onto the Grand Banks off the coast of Canada in search of Swordfish and Tuna. The show portrays the lives of four different crews, and shows the working conditions on a long line boat."
3,Horrible Production,"I actually like the show a lot. As the #1 fan of Deadliest Catch I can say I don't mind the similarities in the show and it is different enough not to call it a ""kncok-off"". I won't be buying the second season, and here is why: The horrendous bridge between scenes makes me crazy. The obnoxious sound of a bat hitting a metal trashcan along with ultra fast zooms into the same bubbling water is so annoying I almost couldn't get through the whole season. So many shows are using that stupid, fast camera zooms and all it does is make me dizzy and want to stop watching. Whoever thought of this ""bridge"" between scenes should be fired!"
1,Knock Off Deadliest Catch,"This is a Knock off Deadliest Catch. It is in no way as entertaining, I can appreciate the Job they do. But it just isnt as good."
3,Not what I expected,I like this CD just fine but it was not what I expected or really what I wanted. I was looking for an all instrumental Christmas CD for my Autistic son. He does not particularly like the Christmas narration or the singing. I will make sure to read the description more closely next time.
5,Love this series,Am laying in a supply of these Classical Kids CDs for future grandchildren. Want my grandkids to be well read and to know about classical music as well as the old children's songs my mother sang to me.
1,THIS IS NOT ESTROGEN,"So called ""phytoestrogen"" is not estrogen; neither is it ""natural estrogen.""This appears to be false advertising.To be estrogen, it should one or more of the following:estrone (E1),estradiol (E2),estriol (E3)."
5,great,I would use product & seller again! Got here on time & does what it says it will do... I will look up when I am running low & order more!
3,IDK,"been taking these for a while, only change i have noticed is a slight pep in my step in the morning"
3,Be prepared to spend time,"I found this this really heavy. I was able to balance my Canon Mark ii 5d, with a 70mm-200mm lens on it; took about an hour. Spent another 4 hours walking around with it; I had trouble with drift; even the wind can cause camera drift, had very little usable footage. If you want to use this, and make shots like you see on you tube, you will need the body pod vest to stabilize, (unless of course, your feet don't touch the ground as you walk and you have arms like those guys that always seem to be in the gym looking at their biceps). I didn't realize this. . why they don't just say, you need the vest, in the item description is beyond me. Good luck, as for me, I am considering purchasing the vest, it would be fun and cool, but to shell out another $200? Is it worth $500+? Maybe I'll cancel my Comcast cable for 2 months, that will save me about $300!"
5,Exelent!!!,"I like it, is a exelent attachment to give fluency to my videos, use it is learned rapidly, my council for those who are going to use it is that they exercise forearms and hands previusly."
5,Transformative,"Incredible, peaceful, soothing and a feeling of being transported to a different space and place. This is my first Yuri Sazonoff CD and I recommend his music while doing any of the wholistic healing modalities; Reiki, Reflexology, Massage, Acupressure, etc. or just to listen after a busy day of working. A wonderful way to calm the mind and release stress."
2,Book for college,"The book was in the condition as stated online. The trouble I had was that I received the book almost a month after I ordered it. I needed the book to read and to write a paper. I ended up having to borrow the professor's book, because the book arrived three days before the paper was due."
1,"This video is of poor quality, poor content, and badly made.","This video deals with young Chinese prodigies. Some of it is entertaining, but much of it is incomprehensible. Although it has some subtitles, many times they just disappear. Much of it seems to be very old footage. The content is very poor. The quality of the video is very poor. It certainly does not reflect contemporary China."
1,AKA: Gestapo's Last Orgy-,"pretty bizarre italian Nazi sexploitation film, but without the titilation and the Nazis didn't look very German. well maybe like some southern germans, but on the whole not very german looking.as for the title, no hitler, no caligula. but caligula was roman and romans are the ancestors of today's italians... so a roundabout connection excuse for the title? but no hitler. maybe caligula reincarnated as Cammandant Starker? But that wouldn't have made sense to folks. And since Starker wanted a transfer to the Eastern front for more honorable service, maybe the title could've been : Caligula reincarnated as Alma? She was the sadistic Venus in furs, co-Commandantin. The alternate title, closer to the Italian, ""Gestapo's last orgy"" is somewhat better.lots of ewww moments. One ""Huh?"" moment: Hair panty. Yep. Panties made of long light brown hair. thoroughly untitilating.a curiosty film to say the least.why was this made? did this actually net a profit?"
5,This movie is great,This movie is the best b movie I have ever seen. I have seen a lot but this one has it all.
1,Poor quality video,"I wanted to get some video tapes of Alaska for my elderly Mom, since she remembers Alaska fondly from her childhood. I thought that these videos might be dated, and not the greatest in cinematography, but I didn't think she'd really mind. They are pretty much what I expected, except that in addition to the above, they are also taped at EP speed instead of SP. I've never heard of a video for sale being taped in EP mode, and as you might expect we couldn't get the tracking to work properly. Total junk."
2,Clearcase Books,Its a used one and not a brand new. As I have ordered for new book. I wondered how this order has got replaced by old book.
5,Brilliant and biting collections of essays on pop culture,"""Boxed In"" is a collection of essays on TV, Elvis, movies and the future. Miller's piercing critical analysis of the world of pop culture is no dry thesis. It contains hilariously colourful, laugh-out-loud, read-to-your-friends, genius (and often biting) observations of the media and the world we live in. There is a cunning essay on the TV game show ""Family Feud"" as well as a very shrewd essay on the Jerry Lewis telethons that are especially clever and funny. A must read."
4,dancing with the bears,"Have worn this hat climbing Mt. Everest, sailing the ocean blue, flying in a multi colored spacecraft, also playing golf, so far so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,do not like it,"Not much explaination. I don't know if you know the language in indian , would it be better. For me , the english version really does not tell me much."
1,OUT OF STOCK,Never got the product- was out of stock- but supplier did notify me immediately and refunded my purchase amount promptly
4,Action Pack,"Great use of previously invented Sci Fi paraphenalia, lots of action, would love to see a good movie made out of it."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was looking for a fun read and took a chance, I wasn't expecting to get as engrossed as I did. I recommend this if you like space opera."
2,Whoa!,The excerpt published by Amazon just above these reviews has errors in grammar and consistency in the first two paragraphs. Is it LeSoit or BeSoit? They're both used for the same person in almost the same sentence. Commas are not used correctly and some words run together. Maybe someone typed the excerpt by hand?
2,Junk Food,"These books are okay but a basic waste of time. After seeing the reviews here I decided to check them out. I should've listened to my friends who told me not to bother and recommended stick with Hesse and Heinlein and Bradbury instead. Now that I look at these reviews about the Doyle-MacDonald stuff after having actually read them they seem generated by friends of the writers anyway, which is fine, more power to them. (I think they teach a writing course or something). But if you're looking for something that does more than absorb your time, keep looking, you won't find it in by these run of the mill genre imitators. Other than that, the writing is okay."
2,Too much talking...,"I didn't know that this is some interview or something. I of course have no idea what been said, but what music there is on is great. Perhaps 3 songs in complete form.Don't get me wrong, I love Alexandre, I think he does great music."
1,She teaches?,"I know why the author gave herself 5 stars, she is the only one that thinks highly of herself. I agree with the last reviewer, ""This book is NOT for the ""teach-yourselfer"""", and I will try to return this book. The book is written very, very sloppy."
5,Fab As Always,"Well, in my usual tradition of reading a new FBorFW book, I reread the whole series prior to reading Sunshine and Shadow. This one will leave you with a lump in your throat. And the kicker of seeing 'the kids' as adults. Reading the strip of Gordon telling Michael about his new son, I thought of Gordons introduction to strip-aka-""Enter Space Trooper number 7."" Things have nearly come full circle and what a marvelous shared journey it's been."
2,"It's OK, but I've read better, a lot better.","The book was an ok for a first time read , but after it became too damn uppity and ""the world is a good place to live in"" type of book for any rereading value. The character, Mike, is well shown,though. LJ has turned the once very funny book series, into a social issue comic. I personally read the comics to laugh, not think soundly on thoughts that are for another time."
3,johnny thunders dead or alive,johnny thunders junkie or not still ruled the punk world dvd is ok some dubbing but still good great for heartbreakers fans
2,"Johnny is great, but this DVD isn't","This DVD is mostly footage from a later concert in Paris. Johnny is sloppy (of course) and it seems that they went back in and overdubbed almost all of Johnny's guitar and vocal parts later. In my opinion this pretty much ruins the live feel of the video and it becomes more of a let's watch live footage while listening to a poorly synced studio recording. This is unfortunate because the moments when they leave the original sound alone are great. I love Johnny Thunders and I'm glad to have seen this video, but I would recommend renting it not buying it."
1,"born to lose? nah, just BORING.","What a massive disappointment. ... I agree with the guy below who says that there's way too little '77 footage or interview stuff ... And you don't even get the performance, it seems! There are plenty of times when Walter Lure strums his guitar and there's no sound emited. And a lot of the footage doesn't quite match up with the music. ""Born to Lose"", for instance, STARTS with a snippet from the studio cut, then goes into a live reading of it. And most of the time, when there is ""live"" audio, it's not clear whether it's from the same date the '84 footage was shot -especially since things happen musically that don't go with the visual and vice versa. What a waste. I wish I would've hung on to my money...I could use it whenever the hell the Thunders documentary _Born to Lose_ hits DVD..."
1,"Could be great, but the overdubs ruin it","If this is, as the label proclaims, the ""only film available of Thunders in concert,"" then it's definitely worth owning for that reason alone. And if the producers had left the original audio intact, this would get at least 4 stars. But the overdubs are just terrible, and completely unnecessary. The footage is most impressive for showing just how far gone Thunders was by this time, and I just don't see the point in trying to ""clean it up"" with overdubs, especially when they are this obvious and poorly done. There are several times when Walter Lure and Johnny are just wandering onstage noodling on their guitars, and the overdubbed Johnny is still singing - what a joke! If they would re-release this show minus the overdubs - and the unnecessary splices of the airport security guard playing with Johnny's earring - this would be a must-own."
3,Eight Large,"The Lyceum show of 1984 was supposed to be great. Think of it: the original Heartbreakers reunited.... But, no. Johnny, EVER Johnny, had to do it. He ordered eight double vodkas before the show. It is horrendous. It reeks. But I recommend it. Why? Because it's the Heartbreakers--Walter rolling his eyes in exasperation; Jerry in perfect, savage form; Billy, weird as always, and always on the right beat. The extranous stuff is fascinating to all who find such stuff interesting. Buy this if you love the Dolls and their heirs."
3,"Buy if a diehard fan, otherwise Netflix","Bad dubbing, Johnny is boring and kind of out of it. Even his guitarist is bored during So Alone. But if you are a hardcore punk and a punk collector, buy it because he's Johnny Thunders. Plus I can never get enough of Personality Crisis."
5,Perfect gifts!,"I collect Giant Microbes and currently have over 50 of them, so I know my microbes. Red blood cell is one of my favorites because it actually looks like it has a face with the eyes and a ""mouth."" These plushies are soft and cuddly, yet very informative. The tag on this one has a nice mix of science and colloquialisms, along with a few puns and sentences about donating blood. Almost everyone knows what a red blood cell is (and this one's adorable), so I give these out as gifts to teachers and fellow biology nerds."
4,Bought as a Gag Gift for My Favorite Medical-field Nerd,"Bought this as a 5 year anniversary present to my girlfriend who is entering her first year of Pharmacy School. It's cute and a great conversational piece. The most often asked question is why she likes it to which we respond, ""Well it's her favorite cell of course!""Makes a cute grad gift for anyone entering the medical field that they can squeeze as they cry themselves to sleep in preparation for the MCAT or PCAT!"
3,Mostly for mob enthusiasts,"Rather messy. Not very structurated, but absolutely interesting for the mob enthusiast. An endless rewiev of places and persons. If one do not have previous knowledge of these, one soon gets bored."
5,2 for 1!,i love these two movies. Its great that they come in one disc. Dont miss out on these two great comedies!
4,Funny movies,"The first one was better than the second, but the two movies make for a decent duology. What I especially liked about these two movies were the relationship between Junior and the head of the orphanage and later on principal (Played by Gilbert Gottfried) Junior is a brat, but inside he really has a good heart, he just needed the right person to tall to/reach out to him. Lots of funny scenes in both movies."
5,2 for 1! 2 for ! 2 for 1!,"I loved both of these movies when they played in movie theaters so it was a treat for me to be able to buy both of them for the price of one. Jr. is a kid you either love, or hate, or love to hate. Whatever the case, you'll enjoy watching him figure out his place in society and his new family. A heart warming tale for the family to enjoy.dmill1953"
2,Disappointed with Quality,"I was really looking forward to receiving this particular package as this is one of my FAVORITE childhood movies. Unfortunately, the quality of the DVD didn't meet my expectations. On both Problem Child and Problem Child 2, the screen swerves at the top throughout the ENTIRE movie. It is distracing. I did not expect it to look like a recent, high definition production, but I did expect the screen to be clear. Is there any way I can get a new one in its place. I am willing to send this back?"
4,Very atmospheric . . .,". . . if somewhat unfocused. What I like about it is its wide-ranging musical expression: everything from reggae (""Here's a Goodbye"") to blues (""Hazy Days,"" ""Stolid"") to Latin (""Allende,"" ""Deluge"") to faux-ballad (""Dega"") to real ballad (""Eweslepe,"" a simply gorgeous piece featuring a very convincing and evocative Chris Cheek on soprano sax) to Heartland jazz (""Tuckahoe,"" with its stirring, heartfelt, almost John Cougar Mellancamp vibe) to faux-fifties (""The Clowns Go Marching On,"" my personal favorite, perfectly evoking the backseat of a Ford Fairlane 500 at the local drive in) to waltz time (the gorgeous ""Dance of the Infidels, my second favorite cut). Stephan Crump can do it all.My only complaint is that it lacks a center. But that's OK. I'm sure he's trying to show off his range of expression, which is quite remarkable. I'm looking forward to further excrusions by this very accomplished bassist.4 and 1/2 stars."
5,Wonderful Wagon,Amazon had the best price on-line...Was shipped on time and in excellent condition...Pretty easy to put together...I love the bigger sides and bigger tires...Grandkids loved it...
3,Wagon geat except for dents and dings on primary wagon body.,"Wagon geat except for dents and dings on primary wagon body. I read the reviews and kind of expected the dents and dings (some even appear to be marks made by a hammer). They are all painted, but it appears that they were in the steel wagon body before it was painted at the factory. For the price...one would expect a beautiful slick wagon to present to your child or grandchild as a gift. The kid can ding it up all by himself. It works fine and is a great wagon, except for the rough body work. (UPDATE): I would most definately buy it again. I should have originally rated it 5 stars."
5,Ya gotta have a wagon!,"I loved these wagons as a child (some 50 years ago) and love them still. Air filled rubber tires make for easy pulling. It is in constant use outside for moving multiple sacks of potting soil, 5 gallon buckets of water,large pots of flowers or shrubs, cinder blocks,shingles,or giving grandchildren the ride of thier lives. The uses are endless."
2,Buy It Where You Can Inspect It First,Am totally dissatisfied with ths wagon as it came dented. The wagon is shipped in a cardboard box with no styrofoam or other packing - the wagon bed absorbs any impacts. The parts are in the bed and there is cardboard to prevent scratching - there were no scratches and the finsih was nice. The pacaging is totally inadequate. I would return the wagon if time permitted. I am glad that I am not giving it to a child as a gift. Buy it where you can look it over first to be sure it's not damaged.
3,red wagon,"The wagon was a little scratched out of the box, but my husband waxed it and got most of the scratches out.The grandchildren were excited about it and hopped right in for a ride."
5,Red Wagon,It's a Radio Flyer red wagon with inflatable wheels. Bought it for the kids for Christmas. They love it! I might just love it more. Wish I had it back in my tailgating years.
3,Workmanship isn't what it used to be.,"This wagon was ordered as a Christmas present for our grandson. It arrived on time; however upon inspecting the item, it had several dings and dents that were obviously done at the factory as the paint was not chipped at all. There was no time to return the wagon, so we assembled it and gave it to our grandson in an ""as is"" condition. Had time allowed, we would have sent it back for replacement. The damage was obviously not caused in shipping. There were 5 dents in the bed of the wagon and in the corners that were painted over in manufacturing. The shipping carton didn't reflect any damage corresponding to these areas."
3,Red Wagon,I think it's safe to say we all grew up with a Radio Flyer in the family. The box is of sturdy construction although the front axle assembly is flimsy and will ultimately fail at some point. My 4 year old son bent the front handle in the first 60 seconds. Like many great products that have earned a great reputation for sturdiness being made in the USA this one is now made in China and suffers the same defaults.
3,"Iconic Design, but cheaply made","I love this wagon because of it's high sides, iconic design, and air tires (very quiet on the pavement). The downside is this is not built like your childhood wagon. The gauge of the steel is very thin. Also the paint is sprayed on so thinly, it scratches extremely easily. Also, if you leave it outside in the rain it will rust quickly."
1,Misleading Title,"This is an out-of-print book that I paid a small fortune for. There is very little out there on the topic of desiging and building a house on a difficult site. Regrettably, I have now discovered the title of this book is extremely misleading. Nearly all of the houses shown are built on large level pads (!?!). A few are partly constructed on the gentlest of slopes. None of the project locations shown here would remotely qualify as a ""difficult site"" in California. There are no ""zero-lot-line"" lots, no real hillside lots. Nothing. Further, all of the home plans (except one) are for highly conventional and rather unimaginative traditional designs, similar to those found on numerous house plan websites. What a letdown. If one of these books becomes available, don't be tempted."
1,Somebody misused my name!,"Somebody misused my name! There is only one Roberto Cazares in Paris. Whoever wrote this review, knows about me being in the work.He/she must have registered under my name to write this review.Roberto Cazares, Paris, France"
1,Bad mic pickup,I've been using this Jabra SP500 for a week now - for use while driving. The speaker sound is great and loud but mic quality is so poor that you are not audible to the other party and will eventually have to speak much closer to the mic or just use your phone instead. I've returned this back for a more reliable brand like Motorola.
1,bad batteries,Product had corrosive batteries. This was a big deal because they are rechargeable batteries and it was supposed to be a new product.
3,Sound Quality and Battery Life,"The sound quality isn't as good as advertised. There seems to be too much background noise where others on the call have a hard time hearing. Because of this I don't use it much, and the rechargable battery doesn't seem to like the intermittent use, i.e. the battery looses charge quickly, so it's often not ready for a call."
3,Good value for price,I've had this product for 3 weeks and so far so good. It linked quickly to my Motorola phone and others claim to hear me just fine. At times the speaker cuts out but so does a regular cell phone. I considered the other model Jabra for twice the price but this one does the job I need (hands-free in NJ) and it is still running on its original charge.
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"0/5The product will not turn on. It worked after my first charge and use, but since recharging it the second time it will not function. Worthless piece of *&^% and a waste of 40 bucks. I want my money back."
4,Great collection,I love lifetime and was suprised that I had not seen many of these movies. There is one that stuck with me about a child suffering abuse at home by her fathers friend. I enjoy lifetime for doing movies that are based on true stories. Sometimes you have to watch some tragic things to remember not everything is fun and games. Well worth the money if you like true stories.
3,Some good,"this was a good set, but repeated in one of the other ""pacs"" i got online. Wish they had listed the movie titles on the web so I could see that I was ordering duplicates the 2 orders...that was disappointing. but passed them on to the Library so they could be shared with lots of people!``"
4,User friendly,"The A65 is big, bright, clear and easy to use. The menu system is very intuitive. In short order I was able to comfortably navigate through all setup and options. Again, I found this unit to be very easy to learn and would recommend it to others."
5,Annoying music then; Good time-y music NOW!,"Everyone associates songs to events in their lives and listening to them takes you back to that place in time. In my humble opinion there isn't a miss on the entire CD-- they really did a great job of pulling in songs from the entire decade, and each one has a memory attached to them. At least for me. :) Back then, yeah, they played the songs non-stop and you pulled your hair out waiting for bands like Deep Blue Something to drift back into obscurity (which they promptly did!). But 7 years later we're all older and wiser, and listening to ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" doesn't seem so bad anymore."
2,Where are all the ground breaking Artists!!!!! 2 and a half stars!! im being generous!,"this cd managed to pick out one hit wonder songs. but how about smashing pumpkins,nirvana, or pearl jam even!!!!??? im also a 70's baby so my highlights of high school were goin to irving plaza right after school, to see great bands like stp,nirvana,rage....... these bands made an impact on the 90's era of alternative scene!i hope someone truly comes together with at least a double cd of nothing but great stuff... until then ill be listening to my old cds."
3,Records a message every time someone hangs up,"I liked a lot of things about this phone, but I returned it for one reason: we get a lot of marketing calls so we screen all of our phone calls. This machine records a message every time someone calls, regardless of whether or not they leave a message. When I get home, I don't want to see my machine flashing 18 messages and when I check only three of them have actual voices and the rest of them are just dead air. That's really an inconvenience for me and a waste of my time. So, the phone had to go back ... even though I liked everything else about it."
1,Very very poor human interface,"Bottom line... it seems to me that Uniden rushed this product to market in the US. The prerecorded announcements have a British accent, the times and dates are in European format. I could live with these, but the human interface is not at all intuitive and the instructions are poor. If you doubt me, try to record a personal annoncement (OGM as Uniden calls it) for the answering service. With the instructions in hand, I bet you can't do it the first half dozen tries. The answering service often beeps (continuously) even when the calling party did not leave a message. No caller ID on the answering base, so for convenience a CID unit needs to be added. And the other features are as hard to use. Even adding another party to a conversation is tedious and fails at times. Voice quality; good; range: barely acceptable; battery life seems good. But I'm returning mine."
1,Very annoying phone,"Amazingly poor phone. Although Uniden can be good at times, this one is virtually worthless:1) The keys on the handset began to wear out after just 3 weeks of use. By 4 months, only 2 of 12 keys were legible. (My nails are quite short.)2) It's very hard to turn the ringer on and off: You literally have to press 6 buttons to get the ringer tone to turn on or off.3) Callers who want to bypass the recorded announcement (outgoing message) by hitting pound can only get it to bypass after pressing pound about 4 times (it works inconsistently)4) If you want to monitor your incoming calls, you have to listen to your outgoing message each time a call comes in (can't turn it off).5) This is obviously a phone prepared for a European market that was dropped onto the American market. Date stamp is not in American format.6) Support staff at Uniden were rude, to put in mildly, and obviously not interested in being helpful to customers."
2,"Nice Phone, good sound.. No headset jack!",Very nice in appearance.Excellent sound and range.No headset jack and no belt clip. What a pity! I sent it back.
1,difficult to read,The plot isn't poorly constructed but the acutal graphic artwork and lettering is difficult to make out. Simplistic can work for a horror graphic novel but it just doesn't here. The artwork should have been flushed out more. I also have a problem with the color scheme.
5,Excellent adaptation of an excellent novel,great artwork. people who have read the novel won't find anything new it's basically a word for wrod adaptation but that's not a bad thing. it's cool to see pictures put to the images you've already made in your head.
1,Just a rehash of the book,"As at least one other reviewer has noted, this graphic novel is nothing more than a rewrite with illustrations of Richard Matheson's novel. This would be fine, even great, if the artwork were good. It isn't. Even if you have not read the novel, this illustrated version is disappointing. The artwork is entirely devoid of any inventiveness, energy, inspiration. I've seen first-pass storyboards that were vastly more compelling than the illustration in this book. (Check out the storyboarded alternate ending to 28 Days Later for an example.)This will be adequately entertaining for fans of graphic novels who are unfamiliar with Matheson. Otherwise, it's a disappointment."
4,"Good, but not great","i really enjoyed this book, got through it pretty quick, the only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because there was a few slow parts that i felt drug on.If you're a vampire fan, go ahead and pick this up.also, i suggest the movieThe Last Man on Earthwith vincent price. It's much better than the will smith one"
5,Best Book Ever - BUY IT,"This is the graphic novel adaptation of my absolute favorite book. It does not leave anything out. I have the original four part series that is collected here in one source, and let me tell you it was extremely difficult to locate them. SO buy this if you know what's good for you...Or you can scavenge through every back alley comic book store across the country like I have. You're choice."
2,Too literal of an adaptation,"There are two major pitfalls in adaptations. The adaptation can either be too loose or too true to the material. Most can cite too loose translations but rarely do we criticize material for being ""too true"" to the details while losing the spirit. Zack Snyder's utterly boring Watchmen movie is one prime example.This book is way too close to the source material. Every line and every word seems to be transcribed directly from the original text without regard to what works in storytelling. At times it works, but for the most part it plods along in much the same way the source material plods along. Niles even includes the boring chapters about how the disease turned people into vampires which not only stop the story short but ask you to believe that the construction worker hero has learned biology and pathology in his spare time.The artwork is suitably desperate and creepy but the story is too long and too true to the source material to really be entertaining."
5,I finally have all four issues!,I Am Legend is one of my favorite stories and to finally get all four issues in one graphic novel is the bee's knees. I enjoyed this adaptation so much. Miles better than that horrible remake that has very little to do with the original source material.Highly recommended
2,Expensive and anemic little things,"I couldn't believe the price for these berries, and they're a third of the size they should be. I'll stick to buying mine from the local Asian foods grocery at $3.25 a pound."
3,goji berries,"I purchased these berries based on the reviews , it was a mistake , they are very expensive and not as great as advertised , not bigger nor softer than others , navitas , for example . Also they are full of mold , which is gross ."
3,"Sunfood Goji Berries, Certified Organic, Non-GMO, 8oz",This was the first time I ever tasted Goji Berries. I was not crazy about the taste. The pricing a bit high even for organic.
5,Good Bite,"I heard that Goji Berries were bitter, but you proved them wrong. These have a little sweetness and moisture to them. I am glad I chose them. Taste just like they were described. Will definitely purchase again."
2,One of Ann Hui's lesser efforts,"Passable effort by Ann Hui, the result is neither mystery nor thriller, but a rather drab effort heading for nowhere in particular. Andy Lau (how many movies of his have I seen in the weeks past?) plays a foreign student in Japan who spends more time careening the streets than in studies. Cherie Cheung has her Jap boyfriend killed by a triad leader and approaches the former for help. It takes half the movie for the premise to be revealed, but this even when done, it can't salvage a dreary movie. By the end, all the fine cinematography seems to make for little value. On the up side, Fortune Star's print for this DVD is very clean and sharp for a HK movie."
1,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,THE BIKE CAME I PUT IT TOGETHER TO FIND OUT THE CHAIN KEPT FALLING OFF AND THE PEDAL SET WAS CROOKED. I HAD TO TAKE THE BIKE APART AND SEND IT BACK AND COULDNT GET A NEW ONE BECAUSE THE MODEL WAS DISCONTINUED.
4,Tilt Could be better,We mounted this our crane and got decent footage from it. As mentioned at the title and from a few other review's the tilt is OK... Still very usable and for the price can't be beaten. We used a Canon 7D with a 24-105 with a HDV-Z96 mounted to the hot Shoe and it' seem to handle the weight... Long term... That is unknown
1,Does Clymer not have an editor?,"I recently purchased a bmw f650 motorcycle that came with this manual. It came time to change the rear tire. The manual gave decent instructions on how to do this properly. It wasn't until I got to putting the wheel back on that the glaring shortfalls in this publication became apparent. The text makes reference to a table 5 for specifications regarding chain tightness. There is no table 5 in that chapter, and the table 5 covering the whole book (in chapter 1) does not have anything to do with chain tightness. To find the proper torque to tighten the axle nut down, the text references table 2 without any page number. Only by looking through the entire book did I find table 2, which was in a different chapter later in the book, and discovered that the proper torque is 100 nM. I would have been better off just looking on faq.f650.com or a different manual."
2,Love these but they are fragile.,I purchased twelve plates and I am down to nine and have chips in six of them. They would probably have lasted longer if I didn't have to hand wash my dishes. The bowls and smaller plates have faired far better.The coffee cups are stained and the plates and bowls have stained in the past but the staining washes away after a couple of uses.I love the turquoise crackle and the dark brown/black underside. I wish I could find something that looks just like this set that would last longer.
5,addition to present dishes,"I had broken a bowl and a small plaate. I had a hard time replacing the plate, and it cost a lot to replace the bow. Then I found the whole set at Amazon. I was thrilled. The thing that is strange, is that I had called Target and they had none listed, but this set came from [...]"
5,Everyone should have a copy of this book!,"My mother bought a copy of this title for me to give to her future grandchild. I was so inspired by it, that I want to give it to all of my friends now. This book has delightful drawings and a wonderful message. This book is fun to read as an adult and a child. It is so important that children and adults are surrounded by positive messages like the one this book has to offer. I recommend it for everyone!"
4,Great Bathroom set,Very happy with this batroom set. I bought 2 for a remodel... one came with a broken glass but Amazon replaced it right away with one easy phone call. Bulbs are a bit odd... you need 4 - B10 bulbs rated at 25 watts each for the light... my local store did not have them but most large home stores will. I got my bathroom sets for $19.00 each on a gold box specail... that made them even sweeter.
1,It doesn't work at all,"Due the lower price of the charge I decide to buy it, but it doesn't work on my Sony Ericson w300i at all, bad inversion"
5,Wow - This is Great!,"Finally! Someone found a way to tell people not only HOW to read, but WHY it is so important to read - something my high school teachers never managed to drill into my head. The authors really get into the nitty gritty about the importance of reading. It's not just to be smarter but for your own personal growth and understanding of the world. If you have never read a play or poetry, you'll want to try it. If you are a reader of fiction, you'll understand what to look for in your reading which will allow you to read your favorite books in a whole new way. I don't read magazines at all, but this book even gets into that. If you're in school, you HAVE TO GET THIS BOOK! If you're not in school, get it anyway. It's good for everyone. Many thanks to the authors for finally saying it straight."
1,It is for idiots,"I purchased this Idiot's Guide thinking it might have something to offer to students who have trouble reading and writing critically. It offered nothing but obvious, tried and not true methods. I returned it."
3,Could have been better...,"This book serves as a good tool for quick reference, but falls short when it comes to details. Due to the great number of subjects and people covered in this mini ""encyclopedia"", the descriptions are superficial and lacking in depth.I also found that quite a few important figures of the time were missing, whereas less important ones were abundant.The book, if done properly, would have been at least twice its current size and a far more accurate tool of reference. Still, good intentions, right?"
5,"Excellent book, even if out of date","This is an informative resource of Nazi Germany. Many people who wouldn't normally be included in such encyclopedias are here, such as Lieut.-General Walther Wever and Goering's first wife. It also includes philosophers who lived before the formation of the Nazi party that influenced the Nazi ideology including Paul Anton de Legarde and Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau.Yet another fascinating aspect of the book is that includes many victims of the Nazi regime, such as Walter Gempp, the chief of the Fire Brigade of Berlin.Overall, the variety and detail of this book is stunning, and I would recommend it for any student of World War II or Third Reich history."
4,"Good Compilation, Usefull",I have been reading about the Third Reich over the last several years and had been wanting a resource that would give me some insight on various characters / events as I came across them. This volume helped. I would have preferred that the pictures were better.
5,Great Book for Healthy and Delicious Muffins!,"I've been making an effort to make more of the breads, quick breads, and muffins I make whole grain and naturally sweetened. I checked out this book from our local library and made several of the muffin recipes. I was very pleasantly surprised with how many of the recipes are heavy on the whole grains, but moist, delicious and flavorful. I liked it so much I am purchasing it for my cookbook collection. Great book."
4,Great Cookbook,"I have several other cookbooks for muffins, this one is different and the recipes look very good. I have not yet made any as I live in a very rural area and it is hard to find the different types of flour these recipes call for. I am really excited about trying some of these as I make muffins every week."
1,Not as Advertised,I bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift and was very disappointed. The receipies call for 2 or 3 different types of flour and many replace fat with apple sauce. I was looking for basic muffins with a number of flavor ideas. This isn't it.
2,eh...cute book but not impressed,"nothing like keeping 5 different kinds of flour on hand, and wondering where to get half the product in the recipes, after you've looked them up on the internet to find out what they are in the first place.try the Ultimate Muffin Book by Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough instead."
2,Too pretentious to be practical,"My mom got this book as a Christmas present, and was quite disappointed. A lot of the ingredients are not common (such as whole wheat pastry flour, barley flour and rice flour) and she gives no substitution ideas. Though they are interesting kinds of muffins, there are also odd or impractical combinations, like mango and ginger. To top it all off, each muffin has its own story, which is pretentious to say the least. Why must every muffin have some sort of Buddhist connection or deeply-held moral conviction? Bah."
5,Best Muffin Cookbook!,"I borrowed this book from the library because I LOVE muffins. After reading through it, I was surprised to find that the recipes are healthy! They are not loaded with sugar or empty calories, but instead they include whole grains, berries, vegetable purees, and very little fat.I poured through this book and have made several muffins so far. Despite the natural ingredients, one of the recipes I made was the BEST tasting muffin recipe I have ever made. I am SO GLAD I found this cookbook, and I can't wait to try all of the other recipes.This book was not designed to be an easy or ""basic"" muffin cookbook, but rather a wholesome, good tasting one."
5,The best good-for-you muffins!,"I am Diabetic and crave cake. I got this book fromn the library and made several of the recipes, after sampling I bought it. All healthy and easy to find ingredients and wonderfully written commentary goes along with each recipe. I have made about 10 different muffins from this book. Best compliment from my daughter was that they tasted bakery made. As a diabetic I love this book and recommend it highly if you crave cake, some muffins have frosting."
5,Love this CD!,"I participated in the creation of this CD back in 1998, and the High Schools featured are exceptional. If you enjoy listening to choral (and a couple instrumental) versions of some of your holiday favs, this is a great buy. It's too bad there aren't any audio samples on here, but trust me... it's a good CD."
5,Voices of the Future: Unwrapped 1998,"Track Listing:1. King's High School: Sing We Now Of Christmas [Seatle, WA]2. Mark Morris / R.A. Long High School: I'll Be Home For Christmas [Longview, WA]3.

2,Not Happy,My mom purchased these shoes and they are too big for her. She thinks they are nice but would like to return for amaller size.
2,drops connection,"The first one I got dropped the connection after a bit, so while it was fine for synching it was no good for charging. The second one worked great for about a week and then it started to drop the connection as well. I did not try again. My friend got one at the same time that has always worked fine for him."
3,interesting book,This book gives an accurate account of what an officer must face with working with the public.
2,"Ok, not great",I like a few tracks. The sound quality to me sounded terrible - like the high end got cut off.
3,Lights on,I would have given a higher rating had I been sent the clear light bulbs that I had ordered. But I received white bulbs.
1,no sparkle,this tiny amount of edible glitter flakes should have more sparkle - from the same product line the multi color glitter was the right size and glitz -
2,Not Edible,"I have no idea how this product actually looks or tastes when used --- I purchased it because it is listed at ""Gold Edible Glitter"". The first thing one sees on the little container that arrives are the words ""Not to be consumed - for decorative use only"". Since I was going to use it to decorate cookies for a bake sale, I'm not happy about it...."
3,good but yellow not gold,"The glitter is nice, but it is more yellow than gold in color when added to white frosting on my cupcakes."
3,Too pale,I bought this glitter for cupcake decoration but personally I believe it is too pale for my taste. If you like a shinny finish I recommend the disco gold glitter instead.
5,Excellent!!,"Magnificent condition, fast delivery and many number of great photos with interesting articles attached. It amazes me how different human cultures are."
5,Wonderful!,"This book really brings to light the reality of how families around the world eat. It shows the families, their country, the food per week and the cost. It is an amazing book."
5,i was in the book,My name is Tyrone Demery and i am the younger son from the Revis family.doing the book was an amazing and lucky experience. You really never understand how much food you really eat until it's ALL layed out on your kitchen counter.
5,Excellent View,An excellent example of what my grandmother used to say......you are what you eat. wonderful insight on how the rest of the world eats and how disappointing our western diets have become.
3,Corn is not a vegetable,"In this book, corn is incorrectly categorized as a vegetable. This is a major oversight, considering the role of corn in our world. Corn has never been a vegetable. It is a major crop and commodity but it is a GRAIN and its impact reaches far beyond the culinary. Its uses are multitude, and it has also been implicated in the rise in obesity (corn syrup and other corn products, specifically), as well as in producing less-than-optimally healthful livestock which are used as our meat sources. Regardless of your view on the healthfulness or deleteriousness of corn, it remains a grain."
2,Bob Marley Cap,The Cap was too small for an average size 17 yr. old. The patch was cut very messy. I gave it as a gift because I had run out of time to get another gift. I was just shaped very strange. I don't think I will buy another cap from this Company.
3,Note that it is only one DVD for the Part I.,"The picture shows more than one DVD, you are getting only one DVD. Note that it is only one DVD for the Part I. The product picture is only a picture."
4,"Good, but make sure your ceilings are high enough.","This is a well made and fun video to train with. It's the best thing I've found outside of a real teacher, and much cheaper! Only thing is, make sure the room you plan to train in is tall enough for you and your boka. I have a scar on my ceiling, but it taught me a lesson."
4,King of Fools,"A tad on the dry side for the average reader, this scholarly account of the Kaiser clearly explains the influences that came to bear on the man--his family history, his personality and the society in which he lived. Just as his grandmother, Queen Victoria, embodied 19th century Britain, Kaiser Wilhelm II was Germany at the turn of the century. His behavior was in keeping with the beliefs and expectations of the Prussian upper class. Although he is not fully responsible for World War I, his flaws were the flaws that lead his country into World War I. This book is a good account of one of history's great failures."
1,This man should be behind bars.,"Dr. Vance Sherwood was once an employee at Peninsula Village - a long term drug rehab for adolecents, located outside Knoxville, TN.The average stay at PV is about a year.Kids are tortured, taught to turn against each other, and verbally and physically abused around the clock.His liscense to practice medicine should be revoked, and shouldn't even be allowed around children. Anyone who follows the advice in his books, or even recommends them should be brought up on child abuse charges, themselves.My son (now 34 years old) was once a patient at Peninsula Village between 1992-1993. To this day, he still has nightmares about PV, and has attempted to kill himself 3 times since his release. He is now suffering from PTSD, agoraphobia, and cannot function in crowds.This man is a disgrace to psychatrists and should be behind bars."
5,Trusted product,"I've been taking this vitamin for over 2 years. It was recommended by my physician after I was diagnosed with bladder cancer.I can't say for sure that taking this vitamin is the reason I remain cancer-free, but who wants to tempt fate?"
4,Encourages you to play,"Use to have lessons as a kid but never practiced hence can't play now. Buying this book is like playing piano to karaoke and encourages you to play. Then once you have mastered a song and perform it with the CD, it' like having a symphony orchestra in your living room."
4,Taking a Train,"While the tracks are original some sound a little too consistant with each other. But the sounds are soothing background for a groovy trance...Some of the sounds are not so much an eastern sound as one review states but more of an outback Australian sound with the Saharan and Arab influences...but definitely the definitive ""street style"" music that you feel you would find in the NY bohemian underground. Highly recommended to let your mind go."
1,Save your money on this one,"This CD, which is titled ""Subway stories,"" which was an HBO special released in 1997. This CD is neither an OST (Original Sound Track) or Score, but occupies some plane between the two.Although one of the most memorable musical items is ""Subway stories"" acted by Bill Erwin, but evidently played by Mecca Bodega. It is one of the few that are ON this CD.If you were expecting the excellent Sax Cantor Riff, sung by Taral Hicks, it is not there, nor is the excellent Jewish tune by Dan Rous as the Jewish Cantor.Otherwise, the CD is mediocre at best. It could have been better by including some of the other significant music from the movie."
1,Amazon sent the wrong CPU Twice,"AMD makes a great CPU... but beware, if you order this item then Amazon will send a socket AM2 CPU and not a socket 939 CPU. It happened to me with the initial order and again with the replacement order."
5,Reverb DeluxI,"I like this type of honky-tonk/Bakersfield music. I became a real Buck Owens fan ten years after he dropped out of sight And when I hear this new, so called country music I feel lousy. Quite honestly, these new guys are great singers, terrific musicians all, but their music just don't get it. Long winded, rambling stories and tunes that are really not good to listen to. They are fantastic dancers, performers and such, but the music HAS NOT GOT IT, AND THAT GOES FOR THE WOMEN AS WELL. Old timers like Merle Haggard, Kitty Wells Buck Owens, Lorettta Lynn and Tammy Wynett were playing music that made me want to sing and play also. It makes me feel good in my heart. If I'm an old dinasaur, so be it. Modern country sucks. Don A."
5,The Derailers---Reverd Deluxe,I just picked up this CD on 6/3/00. It is great. I hate it has been out so long and I am just now getting it. The Derailers have a sound some what like Buck Ownes or Dwight Yoakam. I would call it Honky Tonk Country. I am a fan of alt-country and this is one not to miss. The producer is Dave Alvin. When I saw he was the producer I knew this CD was worth a listen. I hope to get Western Dress soon.
1,Not worth the money!,"If you are looking for something discussed in great details, say, Multi Threading, consider other books written specifically for that topic.Every topic in this book is poorly discussed and ends just before you decide to dig more into it."
5,Murray is better than Dent,"This story is very authentic. Murray really has Dent nailed. The Jade Ogre is considerably longer than a Dent Doc Savage novel and is paced more sedately, but in almost every other way it reads like a Dent novel from about 1935. It does lack Dent's signature errors and sometimes muddled plotting, but these are not grave flaws."
1,Dont waste money,I just bought this item after seeing previous comments. But this camera is aweful. Just waste of money. Produces horrible video 90% not clear. I can't see myself. buy a better product for little extra money. Worst possible picture.
1,very bad; stay away from it.,"If u really want to use a webcam with these new technology advancement, then this is not it. Choose a better one. It gets just struck for a long time and th image quality is pretty bad."
1,"Kill me, now.","This book is sooooo repetitive i wanted to die. The entire book was based on assumptions and opinions. I am forced to read this book for one of my classes in college and my peers also disagree with half of the things they say in the chapters. Maybe he has some inner hatred towards the system, i dont know, but i should not be forced to read something so opinionated and inaccurate. Times are changing and schools are changing with it without the ""help"" of this book. Do not make students read this, unless you want to torture them. If i have to hear the words ""racial gap"" and ""i dont know what i dont know"" one more time, im going to set the book on fire and roast marshmallows over its flame."
5,Truly a courageous book!,"This is truly a courageous book! Richard Hernstein first broke Political Correctness's stranglehold on the discussion of race and educational achievement with his book The Bell Curve, and though that groundbreaking book was meticulously researched, the author suffered a hail of mindless political-inspired assaults. Now, the authors of this book have built on Hernstein's work, calling for meaningful dialogue on what changes need to be made to the American educational establishment to provide meaningful results for non-whites.If you care about the future of America, then read The Bell Curve and Courageous Conversations about Race!"
4,Very though provoking,"I had to buy this book for a class. I found it to be quick read and thought the information was organized pretty well, although a bit repetitive at times. I thought the authors did a good job at presenting potentially uncomfortable/contentious topic and provided good conversation starters. My biggest issue with the book, is that the authors seemed to not fully acknowledge or recognize the tremendous burdens our society places on teachers (full disclosure I'm the child of a public school teacher)."
4,Courage beyond comparison,"Defiant Courage told the story of one man's struggle to escape the German army during WWII. His story made me feel in complete awe of his determination and the will of the people of Norway to aid him. If he had been caught, anyone helping him would also have been put to death. Each time he turned for help, people didn't hesitate a moment but immediately gave food and clothing to help him escape across the mountains and into Sweden and safety. And exciting read and also a true experience."
2,Great story. Not particularly well written.,"I bought this as a followup to reading ""Unbroken,"" hoping it would be along the same lines. The actual story is amazing. However, the writing suffers by comparison. ""Unbroken"" is a masterful work. ""Defiant Courage"" is an interesting recitation of a fascinating event in WWII."
3,"OK, but lacking","There are a few new cues on this disc, but some from the movie are still missing. I was especially hoping for the music during Maximus' self-defense massacre and flight home to save his family, but it is absent. You'll get a tribal mix and a club mix of ""Now We Are Free"" which you might enjoy. But there are at least three songs that are straight from the first disc, and renamed -- and a few others that are segments of songs from the first. The Dialogue works well, I think. All in all it is wonderful music of course, but stick with the first one unless you absolutely must have it all."
5,Thrilling - Chilling,I meant to order the Gladiator soundtrack but in my rush I accidentally ordered More Music ... and just received it and am listening to it. I love it ... I am getting chills listening to the lines and the music. In reviewing the comments most of the people seem to be unhappy so I am glad I made the mistake because I just order the soundtrack so I am going to be in a really exciting treat. Thanks.
5,Powerful,"Hans Zimmer proves once again that as a score composer, he is in a master. I love ""Juba's Mix"" of ""Now We Are Free"" (which happens to be my favorite song on both soundtracks). I just wish people would give Lisa Gerrard her due and stop saying that the songs are by Enya. She has a powerful, hypnotic voice that transcends the orchestrations and brings emotional fulfillment to the score. If I could have given this album any more stars I would have. My only problem is the dialogue takes away from a few of the tracks, but anytime I get to hear Jaoquin Pheonix is a good day!"
1,The Search For More Money,"Although I am a big fan of the original Gladiator Soundtrack, I am displeased with this one. Most of the tracks are re-hashes of the same music from the original soundtrack with a few lines of dialog from the movie added. I was hoping for MORE new scores of music.Here's what you'll get: -about 2 or 3 new scores that you've never heard before [which aren't all that great since you'll have nothing to associate the music with ... e.g. scenes from the movie] -the same music you already have [re-mixed] with dialog from the movie added in certain placesThe title of my post is ""The Search For More Money"" because that's why this ""sequel"" soundtrack was created. They are capitalizing on the fact that people will buy this because they liked the first one. If you have the original soundtrack, save your money, you're not missing anything. If you don't have the original, this album might be fine for you, but I still recommend the original ... save your money and only buy ONE of them!"
5,Essential,"One of those pivotal soundtracks. Unfortunately, there is dialogue over a few of the tracks, but it is well worth sitting or fast-forwarding through. There is a duduk (the sound used for that thing Mr. Tumnus plays in 'Narnia'), and I have fallen in love with it. There is the use of a female voice (Lisa Gerrard) wailing in another language, which had become something of a trend ('Troy', 'Munich', 'Narnia' again, and many others). ""Now We Are Free"" is the kind of song that first intrigues you, then entraps you, and then takes you on an emotional ride. The soundtrack is intensely bittersweet, exciting (""The Gladiator Waltz""--yes, you're supposed to giggle--Hans did!), and just very consumable. If you were impressed by movie--and I haven't run into anybody yet who wasn't--then consider this soundtrack an equivalent of that experience, but audio."
5,Great,"This CD isn't as good as the first one, but it's still good. It's the same type of music, although some tracks contain dialogue. In my humble opinion, I think the dialogue adds to the music. It reminds you of the movie. A 'new' instrument, the duduk, is used excellently in the first track. Many tunes you may have overlooked are included here. It's a great addition to the first volume. Just go buy it; you won't regret it."
3,Neutral,"I was hoping for great & extended things with the two Now We Are Free mixes, but, while both are good, they're not anything special. As for the rest of this ""More Music..."" record, I believe more score material without so many inserted movie actor lines would have made more sense for this release. Afterall, the entire script can be found on the film's DVD, and it's probably safe to say that most ""More Music..."" owners have the DVD. A big neutral for me ... waiting for ""Even More Music from the Motion Picture Gladiator""."
2,Not As Good As First,"While I absolutely loved the first ""Gladiator"" soundtrack CD, this second one is nothing more than an inferior rehash of the first one. Save your money and continue listening to the original soundtrack!"
2,Disappointing companion to the Oscar nominated score.,"The original score for Gladiator was a grand triumph for composer Hans Zimmer. Unfortunatly, this cd follows a trend during the latter half of the 1990's. When you have a successful score cd, follow it up with a cd full of dialogue, demo tracks and occassional new music. That is what this cd is full off. I expected more of the great music from the movie, instead I was disappointed bitterly."
4,Very Good! but...................,"Please note that this CD is basically an add on (I also have the orinigal). the reason why I gave this CD only 4 stars is two reasons.1: in some tracks the music gets disturbed with some dialogue from the movie. Some of you may like it, but I do not.2: One of my favoroit tracks I heard in the movie is not available in any of the two CD's although some of it is in this one. The track I am refering to was the one when Maximus ( the main charactor) becomes the slave a very nice tribal music comes into play in the movie when his captors take him to Zuchabarr. It is a pity that it is unavailable.But neverless this CD has very nice music which some of it is not used in the film at all. For those who like Zimmer's music. This is a good pick for you."
4,Take it shopping.,"I don't go shopping for fish without this book.In Seattle, there's an abundance of Asian markets, carrying an assortment of fish that most Westerners without a big fish-cooking or Asian background will recognize. This book includes a lot of the seafood that I have debated over but feel more confident experimenting with due to its guidance.There are sections even explaining what the different types of canned crabmeat mean. YES.I take it with me everywhere, eating, drinking, and yes, in traffic.<3*joy"
2,Tons of info but too vague...,"I bought this so I could have a really thorough book when it came to cooking any fish. Well, this book has every fish imaginable but when you attempt to look up a specific fish and how long to cook it you get a range of fish of that particular species. Also, the cooking time is a range: Example: Chilean Sea Bass is listed under white bass with cook time of 5 minutes to 25 minutes (???). Okay, and then, how about this: For cook time, it refers you to two seperate page numbers but then you only get the vague cooking instructions because it is for a wide range of fish types. I finally got frustrated and found the answer on the internet. Save your money on this book."
4,Fireplace dvd,Pleasant to play on a cool evening. Scenes change quietly for a realistic approach to a real fireplace with logs burning. Amazon shipped very quickly.
4,Vivian Hsu in Angel Heart,"Vivian Hsu (Hsu Shu Chuan) is one of Taiwan's prettiest girls, but she is most well known in Japan where she has a rock band. This movie, maybe has a few holes in the plot, but Vivian is at her most sympathetic and maybe most dramatic in this film. Rated R (X--category III Hong Kong) for adult content. 4 stars for Vivian."
2,Cliche-ridden with bad acting,"I just can't find anything positive to say about this film. It's one of those instances when a celeb (Vivian Hsu/Tsui/Whatever) is capitalizing on her stardom to make a soft-core flick. The editing is so bad it's almost funny. I think I've been Americanized/white-washed 'cause I can't make any sense out of this flick. It'd be one thing if it's an honest erotic/porn flick, but it's trying to tell an incoherent story about two people I couldn't care less about. Culture gap? Maybe. I hope so."
1,Very dissapointing...!!!,"This is a collection of songs by a bunch of ""no name"" artists...who are these people...??? The artist names are NOT listed on the CD or the insert...probably too embaressed to want their names on this DC...These are NOT the original artists but are a bunch of wannabee's, and the songs actualy do not sound very good. I've been a radio station DJ (for the last 34 years) and I've never seen such a cheap, bad sounding anonymous knockoff since the early 1960's...I bought this on Amazon and the shipping WAS fast...The packaging is the only good thing on this, and even then, there is NO list of who the artists are...Save yer money and time...This CD is the lowest of the low...and I don't expect the followup CD to be any better..."
4,He Is There and He Is Not Silent,"Requires the reader to think through issues with the author and in doing so, helps the reader to understand why belief in God is practical and able to stand up to close scrutiny."
1,Glad I Didn't Buy This Book,"If this is representative of Schaeffer's other works, it astounds me that he's considered such a great apologeticist. I borrowed this book from the library and read through it five times in three weeks, and was just as confused when I finished the fifth reading as I was when I started the first one. The big turn-off for me was in the very first chapter, with the author's free mixing of his own jargon with philosophical and psychological jargon. If I was someone sitting on the fence as far as Christianity was concerned, the first thing that would enter my brain would be, If it's THIS complicated, I don't want anything to do with it. For that reason, I won't be buying any of Mr. Schaeffer's books, and wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who was just starting out in Christianity. A better starter, IMHO, is Lewis' Mere Christianity."
3,"An ""OK"" book","There are some things in here that I would never make, but there are also some nice patterns I would like to work up (afghans, smaller things, etc) so it's obvious that the publisher tried for some broad appeal. If you don't have a book like this, then purchasing one might be worth your while."
3,Just Okay,"Most of the items are easy enough...but a little hokey. Some are downright ugly. However, the other issue is that some really are not what I would consider ""scrap"" crochet....if I have to have 5 or more skeins of a particular color or colors for a project, it would be beyond the ""scrap"" stage for me."
5,I don't crochet!,"I got this book for my mother for Christmas and she liked it. I don't crochet, so I can't attest to how easy the projects are, but they didn't seem too complicated. And there a lot of really cute ways to use up scraps of yarn. I thought it was definitely worth the price."
3,Never got it,Unfortunatly I am unable to review this book because I recieved an amail saying that it was no longer available.
5,An old guy's POV,"I only saw this once, with my sons, last year around Thankxgiving I think. I don't remember a lot about the details. However, at 57 yrs old, and just as simple a movie lover as you will find, not only did I really enjoy this movie (I have ADHD so no wise cracks about ""well if it's so good old man why don't you remember any of it."" from the peanut crowd.), but my sons, and especially my oldest, who is an extreme critic of movies, thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, we hope there is a sequel. To be honest, w/o going into a long tirade, I am tired of all these movies that come out & end as if there is going to be a sequel...only to never see the light of day. I don't about the reasons. Make up the whole series before you release the is one. Or change the ending. That's all for now. Thank you very much. That will be a buck 2.80 please? :-D GBY!"
2,Routine and predictable,"Uninspired movie making. Routine and predictable. Violates the basic storytelling law ""Show, don't tell"" in practically every scene. The only saving grace is Sam Huntington as Marcus who energizes every scene he is in with his spot on dry and funny delivery."
5,Dylan Dog- the movie,"This is a great movie that I hope there will be sequels to. My wife and I think that the former ""Superman"" redeemed himself. The buying experience was second to none; I will be getting more form this seller!"
4,I Like Monsters And Stuff,"This movie is what it is. It's not for everyone. It's a modern day B-Movie with horror and comedy elements to it, and a ton of action and mystery. Some parts are terrible, but some parts are really enjoyable. I found myself enjoying it, and give it 3 3/4 *'s out of 5, or 7 1/2 *'s out of 10.For a more detailed review, visit [...] or [...]"
3,"Decent Movie, worth the watch","Like my title says, it is a decent movie and it is worth the watch. I won't go all gung ho like the other two reviewers about details, but the movie started out pretty good and it stayed in the good range, there was no real climax in action as it was basically all action. The ending I suppose had a sort of climax then an anti-climax/neutral area. I will say though that the movie will throw you for a loop and that's the only reason I really liked it. I didn't guess the plot at all. I also didn't know it was a comic, which I gleamed from the other reviewers review, so I suppose the fans of this comic might like or hate this movie, and if you didn't know about the comics either, then you'll probably enjoy watching it as well. It just didn't wow me, but if you like a action/horror/comedy movie, then this is worth buying. I would say rent it first, or wait until it hits the 5 dollar shelf mark."
3,Is this a Blu-ray ???,"I saw Dylandog in Blu-ray. I liked the movie, it is fun sometimes and the story is well told by dylandog. BUT, is this a Blu-ray?It looks like a DVD (but not the best ones). The DVD of this movie must be like a VHS !!! What a shame !!!"
3,"Should have been amazing, fell flat","This could have been such an amazing movie but it fell flat. The main character - Dylan Dog - wasn't a very good actor. I'm sorry but he's pretty one dimensional. It felt very rushed and MANY questions weren't answered. (Such as how exactly was the big zombie created, and what is Dylan? He was too tough to be completely human.) It had an interesting plot, it had some twists, I loved Dylan's sidekick Marcus (who really made the movie.)But there were so many plot holes, so many things left out. I felt like it was the second movie. It would have been better if this movie was about Dylan's past. Maybe show us what happened to Cassandra. Like I said through the whole movie, if it was a television show it would be great, cause they could slow it down, pace themselves, and explain things.So I enjoyed it (mostly for Marcus) but it was flawed. 3 stars only because I'm easily entertained, because I love fantasy, and because Marcus cracked me up."
3,Dylan Dog,"Not bad. I didn't expect a grand performance, and it wasn't. But it was enjoyable for friends and family to watch and laugh to."
2,"Superman With Vampires, Werewolves & Zombies! Oh My!","But other then that, this movie blows! It was like watching a seriously bad pilot for a ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" spin-off (Which ""Angel"" was NOT!). Brandon Routh is kind of hot - and we get to see him without a shirt for a bit, Ladies! The problem was the production values were incredibly cheap, the storyline only mildly engaging and I really was waiting for Sarah Michelle Gellar to jump out at any second. Instead they give us a blonde Monster Killer with a vague European accent.Bottom line: don't waste your money on this DVD. But if someone gives it to you as a gift, thank them kindly and keep it for your Halloween Party viewing."
4,Humor and Horror,"It has humor and some scares. I find it entertaining. If you can watch it for cheap, than why not?"
5,FUNKY FUN BOOTS!,"These were just darling--something different. They were comfy, true to size and got lots of compliments."
5,Great for Beginners; Good Quality/Excellent Price,"This guitar is very good, is very solidly made. The extras are the perfect starter kit; come in handy, last for a great while since the guitar is well made I have no need to replace strings. I have had it for 5 months now and it has been a good instrument to me; the guitar keeps up with my rough novice handling; bumps against walls and doorways, and it remains steardy. The color its beautiful, I name it (indeed I did) Luna de Octubre - Octuber Moon."
1,Worthless,"I wanted an acoustic guitar along with my electric guitars yet Im not too enthusiastic about acoustic so I didnt wanna spend alot of money for one. What a mistake to take the chances with this esp after reading so many other bad reviews. This extremely cheap feelin guitar cant even play right no matter how much time you spend tuning it. The strings are not only incapable of being tuned but are too far off the fret board! This can literally not be played. I actually gave this to my young cousin as a toy basically and I think its broke by now. Not cause of him but how could a guitar like this last in anyones hands? The only thing I kept was the non-electric tuner that came with it, which is also a lil crappy. Buying this is throwing money down the toilet...money that you COULD use toward buying a real guitar."
1,Horrible investment,"I got this guitar for 30$ a while back, and really, what quality could I expect? They even nicked it up to 100$, a complete ripoff. Why? Well, this guitar is an abomination. Horribly made, when I received it, I immediately noticed some problems. Huge scratches and dents, a horrible and sloppy paint job on the frets, and several broken strings. It comes with a low quality pick, a pitchpipe(which is actually pretty useful, but the guitar is near impossible to tune) the Gig Bag(not really that bad, as a matter of fact) and some..mints?(Strange advertising, but probably the best thing in the package.)Perhaps you could buy it and put it on displ- oh wait, it's so beat up when you get it it would make wherever you put it a lot worse."
1,Damaged Guitar,"Purchased this guitar for my daughter for Christmas. It was not tuned. Which was not a big deal, just thought I could take it to a music shop and buy an electric tuner or have them tune it. Was told by the store the guitars neck was bent and would never work right and could not be fixed. Purchased her another from that store. So what started out at like a $5o gift ended up costing me $200. Not very HAPPY!!!!!!!"
2,Made a mistake,I thought this was a great guitar until i got it. When it fell once on the ground it had many marks on it. It would go out of tune fast. The strings broke easily. The picks were destroyed in just a month. And the strap was almost useless. The pitch tuner was off tune. And it came with only 2 picks. The worst was that after a months use the bottom of the bag ripped in half so it was useless.
2,Bad starter guitar,"I got the guitar for Christmas last year and it was so beautiful, but when I stroked the strings, the sound was awful, it was impossible to tune and will only make a beginner (like me) extremely frustrated. It's nice to hang on the wall but NOT for playing!"
4,Pretty good looking cheap guitar,"The custom paint is a plus, just wish it had a more glossy look instead of the unfinished brush. The case is pretty helpful but not made of a resistant material, would rather change it with time."
3,Guitar,"Yes this is a beginner guitar. Something with the fret was messed up, if I am correct. If you need a guitar for lessons. I would not recommend this one. It is for fun only. Other than not being able to have the guitar in tune I guess it is okay. Happy shopping."
2,A bad begginer guitar,"I bought this guitar as a begginer. I was very excited about getting one and didn't do my research on good guitar names. This guitar is extremely bad all the way around. When I got it you could tell that it had been just painted and they did a horrible job. The panit was smeared and still wet. And as far as sound, dont even go there. The strings have poor quality, and buz with almost every note you play. It sounds horrible when you do chords as well. So over all this is even horrible for begginers let alone people who are interested in playing for a lone time."
1,Not very good,The quality is poor. My daughter can't even play it. I took it to Guitar Center to see if they could make it playable and the service guy told my not to bother. The sound is bad... Period!
2,Poor translation,"I picked up this edition to read to my young children, and discovered the translation is really, really... unfortunate. The odd wording makes it extremely difficult to read. Heidi is a lovely story- buy a different edition."
1,Poor at best,Well if you enjoyed the game then skip the book. The story is the bare minimum of the game. The characters are not really well flushed out and they don't seem to carry the level of development you see in the game. That says something when a computer game has more character development and storyline than a book.
4,Fun romp through the Planescape,"At first I was wary of buying this book, after trying to read the terrible novelization of Baldur's Gate. But gladly, this book claimed my attention and kept me reading all the way to the end.It's not just a cliffhanger-solution pattern of chapters as some have said. It read to me like a fun, easy, very enjoyable escape. No, It's not great literature, but it is better than one would expect from a simple novelization of a computer game. I think it stands fine as a novel by itself. The closer you get to the end, the longer your reading periods become as you want to find out what happens to Thane.One thing I didn't like was some of the characters were killed and the end could use something more. What happens to Morte? The other characters? It's as if it calls for a sequal, which I would love to see.This is a nice, fun, easy read and I recommend it to someone who wants a little escape."
1,"Worst book ever, seriously. . .","First, the rating is not 'one star', it's a poor substitution for zero stars, since that was not an option. Ok, this isn't the WORST book ever, it just seems that way compared to the game. The game WAS the BEST game ever, with an incredible storyline, fantastic characters and graphics, and it relied more on storytelling and roleplaying than mindless combat. I was so disappointed with how this book took so many aspects of the game that made it so great and mangled them like the scars on the Nameless One (or Thane, as the novel moronically tags him). Annah, a fat, ugly little MAGE? Ravel, a nice old grandma, rather than evil demigod? A stupid green cylinder rather than the enigmatic bronze sphere? WTF?! Anyway, if you actually plan on reading this atrocity (I dunno why you ever would), get the game first; that masterpiece is ruined if this pile of dung is perused prior. Or actually, just get the game, period."
1,The Fall of TSR...,"This book was not worth the 5 dollars I paid for it. I own every book published by TSR (to my knowledge), and have always been a staunch supporter and avid fan of their work. However, this ""book"" gives me pause. I found this book to be unimaginitive, lacking strong characters or plot, and it appears that the writers received very little guidance or feedback on how to make a novel work. If I weren't so steadfast in my support of TSR, I might accuse them of slapping together an inferior book, naming it ""Torment"", and throwing it out on the market to make a few extra bucks for the company while riding the coattails of their highly acclaimed pc game under the same name. Knowing TSR and the great history and level of excellence that it has always strived for, I can only pray that this book is a mistake they will not soon make again."
3,mystery,"The mystery is how large this coated tablet is. I have trouble swallowing the regular brand. It would be helpful if the label would show an 'actual size' example. It would help to be coated, though. The regular brand is chalky and sticks in your throat. I would like the company to send me an email of its actual size, please, before I try this product."
1,NOT as advertised,"No metal O-rings from which to hang the hammock, unlike as clearly shown in photo.Hammock was of smaller dimensions than in description.Due to the restocking fee and return shipping costs, I have reluctantly decided to keep it.Certainly I will never order from Ace Mart Stores again."
3,not as listed/pictured,Overall nice little camping hammock lightweight and collapsable. I only gave 3 stars because it was listed and pictured with metal rings on each end but did not come with them. Not a big problem but I was a little dissapointed. Still a really nice addition to my pack. I hike and camp alot hammock only weighs about a pound and holds my 150 lbs well. I would still have bought it if listed and pictured without rings. CHANGE THE LISTING!!!
4,Portable telescoping hammock,"I had one of the Rothco net style hammocks in the past. I liked it, my son had trouble at times getting into it so, I ordered this spreader bar fishnet hammock for him Most spreader bar hammocks are no good for packing down small. This hammock actually packs down small due to the spreader bars telescoping down. Good product."
4,Green hammock,The parts arrived in a reasonable timeframe and were exactly as described. Is is inexpensive and it is reasonably well made.
5,Love it,"Just what I was looking for and at the right price too. Perfect for packing to the field, normally out for a week at a time."
4,"Fun, fun, fun","My son LOVES this. When I first saw it I wasn't much impressed. But when I gave it to him he sat down and played with it for half an hour. He always has it with him, and will keep playing the songs while he's playing with other toys. Great for Blue's Clues fans."
1,Low paper and printing quality,"The book is excellent and a great author, but considering only the product is not a good paper and printing is like copies. I like the stories but hate the paper and printing."
5,Fun for little ones,"This pool met our expectations....we bought it for our 2 year old and 4 year old to jump around in as their ""kiddie"" pool was too small and got boring very quickly for them. This is a great sized pool and is perfect for the kids to really play around in. We filled ours only to what we were comfortable with for the kids swim levels and made sure that it was empty when the kids played in the backyard unsupervised (the cover is only a cover and can be dangerous unsupervised). Also, since we dumped the water frequently, it hasn't killed our lawn which is something I was concerned with. I'd reccommend this pool to anyone who typically uses a baby pool for their kids and wants something alittle more exciting for them to play in. Several kids would have plenty of room in it. It's a great way to beat the heat and at around $30 it's very inexpensive!"
4,toy conesuer,We have had this pool for two summers now. My five year old son and his friend have spent hours and hours playing and jumping into this pool. We put a small slide going into it and they have a blast. It takes just minutes to blow up with a small compressor and is easy to store over the winter. The down side is that we have to empty and clean it every other time we fill it because it gets so dirty. We also have to add warm water to it every time because it would be too cold to use otherwise. It is getting a little small for our five year old but it has served it's purpose well.
1,Product was defective,"The second time we used this pool it would nort keep air. So, actually, we only got to use it once without a problem and after the second time did not use it again all summer and it was a hot summer. Really disappointed!"
1,FLAT,BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT. TOP RING HAD A HOLE ON THE SEAM TRIED TO PATCH WITHOUT SUCCESS.BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT. TOP RING HAD A HOLE ON THE SEAM TRIED TO PATCH WITHOUT SUCCESS
2,Gambled & Lost,"I purchased this pool on the strength of 1 positive review; I should have paid more attention to the 2 later negative reviews.The pool functioned fine for about 2 weeks, before unlocatable and unrepairable pinholes started developing. I am experienced in locating holes in inflated materials, using soapy water to detect bubbles, but this was a lost cause. In addition, one larger hole from a rose thorn would not stay sealed with the patch material provided."
3,Pool Review,Put pool in yard.... within a week some grass was already poking up through the bottom. I think the bottom could be more reinforced.
1,Too much time invested in pumping it up.,"I took the pool out of the box, saw all the work needed to pump it up, put it back in the box, and returned it. Honestly, I couldn't figure out how to pinch the air holes. I had to pinch them to get air in with the pump. Maybe I didn't have the right tools. Who knows. But I ended up buying a snap pool which holds practically the same amount of water. No pumping, no deflating."
1,Sorry I Wasted the Money,"We loved this pool for three weeks, which is as long as we had it. This morning, I went out to remove a small amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with roughly 1/4"" of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had grass growing up through the bottom of the pool, through plastic. I could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours. A total waste of money."
4,dirty,this pool gets very dirty once u get in it for a little it need a filter ...is there any way i can get 1 ..... i dont want my kids in this water
2,pool,"well its ok. i bought it for my 6 kids ages 2,4,5,5,7,10 the two year old hated it the four year old hated it the two five year olds loved it and the 7 and 10 year old hated it. ITS TWO SMALL! and the little ones are to little for it. so as you can see the size is just no good. it was hard for me to get rid of it cuz it was a gift for my twin girls 5th birthday and they were the ones who liked it. i took them to the store a showed them some pools that they could choose out of they picked one and we brought it home put it up and they loved it even mone more! even better all of my kids loved it!"
2,A lot of work,I bought this pool for me and my little brother. I thought it looked big and about knee deep. The fact is it is only 15 inches deep because if you fill it up past that the wall will collapse. It is also smaller than it lookes. If you have small kids it is perfect but not fun for bigger kids.
4,Highly recommended small inexpensive pool,"We purchased this pool last summer for my then 1 yr old to enjoy. It is large enough that I can lay in the pool and be able to play with her. Now being she is a two year old and more destructive we have not had any problems. She does belly flops and has enough room to play with an air mattress and floats. I do however recommend getting some above ground chemicals to keep clean. We use those weekly and also purchased the kiddie pool vacuum, it is helpful to get bugs and grass out, along with you are filling up the pool at the same time. This is a great pool for families with smaller children. I am able to have my 3 month old be with us at the same time."
3,Where's the air?,This is a great pool if love buying it over and over again. We've had fun buying it 4 times in 2 summers. Our latest only lasted about 2 months and these definately will not make it from season to season. Too bad. My kids love it so much they have purchased 2 pools with their own money because I refused to continue to buy a product with such poor durability. I give it a thumbs down.
3,Swimming Pool,"This pool is great for little kids, however, after one use, we had a hole in the top tube! That is very disappointing considering this is the third pool that we have bought in 3 years (all the same type of pool)! So they definitely don't make them very durable. This will be the last one we purchase!"
5,Swimming Pool,"When I started to look for a replacement pool this past early Spring, I found that they don't put drain plugs in most of them and the thickness of the plastic is much less than before. I got on-line and found this pool which was identical to the one we used to have. It cost a little more than in Target, but it had a drain and was made well. Drains are the most important in a pool 10'x6'x22"" - you can't dump them and to bail the water would take forever. We're very happy with our pool. I also purchased a pool cover this time so we wouldn't have to empty and fill it so often and save some water."
2,No drain plug!!!!,"We have to change water in this pool every 3-4 days. And guess what?? There is no plug that you can pull to drain this pool. Instructions say to empty: ""lower the side of the pool or lift it"". Well have they tried to do that?!?!?You can not lift this size of the pool to drain. If you lower a side, not mentioning that it takes forever to drain, from lowering sides pool sides become deflated and even if you inflate again, they don't hold air as nice anymore.This pool is a really nice size and fun to play, but a big pain to clean. If you find a way to solve this problem it is worth to buy"
5,Great inflatable pool!,"I got this pool to use as a ball pit. I brought it out camping for five days and people were in and out of it all day and all night for those five days. at one point, we had ELEVEN people in it (we were pretty eh, cozy, though). I was really impressed that it lasted the whole weekend with the abuses of people sitting on the sides and such. I had to refill it every once in a while to keep it firm, but other than that, it was great, especially for the price!"
5,Durable and fun.,"The outside dimension is advertised as 120""L x 72""W. Actual measurement is closer to 118""L x 68""W. The inside dimension is 90""L x 42""W, corner-to-corner. The middle walls initially bow inwards to 36""W but will expand to a 42""W when the pool is filled near to the top due to the weight of the water. The advertised 22""H is true.There is a small drain hole at one corner, which is fairly useless. Simply let all the air out of the walls and let the water flood out.To inflate the pool, we use the Metro Vacuum ED500 DataVac 500-Watt 0.75-HP Electric Duster 120-Volt, which we initially bought for dusting out the insides of computer towers. It comes with nozzle accessories that can be used for the pool and can inflate each level in mere seconds."
3,Doesn't hold air well -- will try to return to Intex,"The pool was great at first. However, it has developed slow leaks in both the top and bottom air compartments. Doesn't stay inflated for more than a few days. Can't return to Amazon, so I'm going to take this up with Intex.When it holds air, this is a great pool. Initially was very pleased with my purchase."
3,Fabulous pool but draining is a pain,My son absolutely loved it. Its easy to inflate. Takes around 15-20 minutes with an electric pump. We used a compressor and it was up in less than 10 minutes. The only issue is there is no drainage which is a big huge problem. It takes forever to empty out. I will be buying another pool because its not easy to empty out. I want a pool that can be up and taken down easily.Overall its a very good pool except for the lack of drain plug.
4,Tons of Fun!!!,"I purchased this pool for my kids last year and we have really enjoyed it. We tok it to my in-laws one holiday and all the grandkids had so much fun that my in-laws purchased one of their own. I have however had trouble with punctures. Ours got a small hole in the top chamber shortly after we purchased it and we were never able to find it to repair it. Now it has so many holes that it is impossible to inflate. We also managed to lose one of the rubber plugs and could not find ANY way to replace it. However a piece of rubber fron a popped bicycle tire and the screw cap worked just fine. Despite the problems, I loved the pool so much that we are going to buy another identical one to replace it. Besides, considering the price it is well worth the money."
5,great family fun - easy to set up,We love this pool. Our boys and all their friends jump in and out of it all day long. It has held up for 2 summers and is still in great shape.One hint for set up - open the big air OUTlets and use a hairdryer on cool air to blow up all three rings of the pool in minutes.
4,Intex Swim Center Pool,I bought this pool for my grand children and they love it! It's just big enough for mom and dad to cool off in as well. The top ring lost some air pretty quickly after inflating but not enough to be a terrible problem.
5,Perfect,Mickey Mouse is very much loved in this household. Strongly recommend it for all children and it is perfect for Christmas.
3,Too Short,My grandaughter enjoyed the Mickey Mouse video but said it was too short. The prices for all the Mickey Mouse videos are higher than you have to pay for many other videos purchased through Amazon so I am disappointed at the short length.
3,It's ok but...,"What you're getting here is a Santa themed episode plus two other eps that have already aired. If you don't mind that then it's great. I'd be willing to bet that Playhouse Disney will play this episode when it gets closer to Christmas, you could just Tivo it and save yourself the $$. If you're looking for a Christmas movie with Mickey and the gang I'd recommend Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas."
1,Not a Holiday DVD,"I was upset after watching the first episode. I like many other people were mis-informed about this DVD. It only has ONE christmas episode. I thought this dvd was a DVD full of christmas episodes or even have a movie, but I was wrong. My daughter was disappointed and I was as well. The other episodes on this DVD had nothing to do with the holidays. $15 that wasn't worth spent."
2,Mickey Saves christmas,The tv show that is on weekly is educational and problem solving. But if your kid is over 4 Don't bother with the DVD. It's cute but tiresome after 10 consecutive watchings
5,Mickey Mouse DVD,I bought this as a christmas gift for my boyfriend's granddaughters. They loved it!!! They did not want to open any other gifts on christmas!
5,Love!,"My twinz LOVE Mickey Mouse, so I was excited to add this to our Christmas library. I couldn't be happpier with it."
3,Cute,This is a cute movie but not one of my sons favorites. I was upset also by the fact that they airedit on the Disney Channel right after I purchased it & I could have saved from buying it. Oh well.
4,This Is A Good DVD...,"This DVD is 72 minutes in length.It consists of three episodes,one being Christmas themed and some bonus features which are music and some puzzles.If your child likes MMC they will probably enjoy this DVD.Our three year old granddaughter does like this DVD and has watched it several times since we bought it about one week ago.It would be nice if all three episodes were new ones but most kid's DVD's do not do this.THINK DORA DVD's.We bought this at Target for $3.00 less than Amazon's price."
1,Deceptive packaging.,"Buyer beware. Despite packaging which has nothing but Christmas references, only one of the three episodes on this DVD is about Christmas. The others are standard episodes which could have been included on any other disk. And good luck trying to take it back if you've already opened the movie. Most stores have a strict ""no returns"" policy for openned movies. So if you don't like it, you're stuck with it. How's that for customer service? Do yourself a favor and skip this DVD, unless you are OK with paying for one Christmas episode. Something like Mickey's Christmas Carol is a much better bang for your buck."
3,toddler isn't crazy about it,"Maybe he's too young, got it right before his 2nd birthday but this doesn't keep his attention. I'm sure older kids will like, it's cute."
4,Fun,My daughter loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. This was the first one I bought and she brings it to me all the time. Educational and helps with problem solving.
3,The Nasty Season.,"I am a pretty big fan of SpongeBob and always have been. Netflix has up to season 5 and I saw all of those episodes enough times and I just wanted to watch more so I bought this season. The episodes are alright, they seem somewhat different than the originals but I still enjoyed them. The only problem I had with these is that quite a few episodes had something that grossed me out. It may not bother kids but there was just some stuff that I wanted to find funny but was too grossed out to laugh. If I would have knew about this I would have skipped season 6. If this is the only season you're missing then I would say get it, but if you aren't that big of a fan you aren't missing too much."
4,"Classic laughs for days, Mr. Krabs never lets you down!","I bought this episode after a friend said I should do so, it was a bit out of character for me to buy something I could find on TV eventually. But after doing so was more than pleased with my purchase and enjoyed the show a couple times.Go for it and enjoy!"
4,Correct Product Information,"All the info from several different sources about the episodes included on this DVD set is incorrect, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there's much more than I originally thought would be included.Disc One (Episodes are listed in disc order):SpongicusSuction Cup SymphonyHouse FancyKrabby RoadPenny FoolishNautical NoviceNot NormalGoneSpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big OneA Life in a DaySun BleachedGiant SquidwardNo Nose KnowsPatty CaperDisc Two (Episodes are listed in disc order):Plankton's RegularTo SquarePants or Not to SquarePantsSquid's VisitThe SplinterSlide Whistle StoogesBoating BuddiesThe Krabby KronicleThe Slumber PartyGrooming GaryTruth or SquareBonus Features: The SpongeBob History Song, 7 Shorts"
2,Good and bad,"Well, I think it's pretty cheap to separate Seasons in half and sell each for the price you would have paid for the whole season! I think it's outrageous really. I'm a big fan of Spongebob and got to admit the show's not what it used to be. But, my son who is from this generation, just loves that sponge. Would I buy this: YES, if and only when the COMPLETE season comes out. NO, twelve episodes won't keep my toddler entertained more than a couple hours, and money should be well spent. Something worth the whole shipping and waiting."
3,The picture is deceiving,"The dress is well sewn but the quality of the materials is lacking. The lace is not pink but rather a pale peach color nor is the lace ruffly, which makes a big impact on the cuteness of the dress. I also had to cut some extra lace off the end because they didn't do a very good job on the finishing work.However, I needed another harness for my little dog and I didn't want to pay to send this one back so I decided to keep it. It fits and works well, it's just not as cute as the picture.If you want something REALLY cute, try the motorcycle vest or the denim jacket. My little dog Abby, looks adorable in these.Doggles Dog Harness Jean Jacket, Blue, SmallDoggles Biker Vest Dog Harness, Black, Extra Small"
1,A complete nightmare to assemble,"I suppose this is what you get for buying the cheapest thing the store has to offer. Crappy parts, crappy assembly instructions, and now I see that I should expect it to start rusting badly in a few months. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $20 to get a better product."
3,Dishearting,"Could not get it together, then when I did it was to long and I had no way of shorting it. Ilive alone and have no one to help me. I was mad that I could not make it work. So I bought another type instead. Something easier to put on. I am not happy with it, the tension pole is what I wanted. So I was not a happy camper."
4,Pole shower caddy,"I've had this item a few years. It's still holding up well and carryingall my hair shampoo and conditioners, as well as my wash cloths. It stilllooks stylish."
4,Step Over the Edge,"""Trevor was being shaped by his past, and struggling to find his future. When Trevor signed up for the 3 week wilderness journey with a group of other believers, he expected an enriching time in spiritual growth. What he found, in his judgmental opinion, was a group of misfits that shouldn't even be qualify as Christians. As the trials on the trails begin to unfold, each member of the group starts to see their own strengths...and weaknesses. Each, that is, except Trevor."""
3,Only Kelly is Grand,"The only reason it rated as high as 3 stars is due to Carla Kelly's short story. It was fabulous. She has a gift for opening a window to the lives of ordinary people - proving that ordinary romance can be the most magical of all. However, the rest of the stories were sadly flat and shallow by comparison. Still it's worth buying just for the Kelly story."
2,Not at al memorable,I was very dissapointed. Not a decent story in the bunch. I like all of these authors. Especially Carla Kelly has always been my favourite. These stories feel like they were written over a weekend and not given much thought besides the common theme.
1,A Big Miss all the Way Around,"Anthology series are indeed hit or miss and the stories in The Grand Hotel are a miss all the way around. Romance and humor was seriously lacking in this book. There was little to recommend or differentiate one story from the other. If I had to pick one story that was at least semi-enjoyable, I would choose Barbara Metzger's story as there was at least some attraction and humor between the love interests, though not as amusing as amusing as Ms. Metzger can usually be. Why does Carla Kelly always right such somber romances? For me, somber and romance are two adjectives that should not mix in a romance novel."
5,Primarily for Habanos Lovers,"Anyone vaguely familiar with the Gerards are well aware of their expertise, dedication and love for the Habano, all of which is reflected in this beautiful edition which is actually a package containing two books.Similar to their other literary venture, ""Havana Cigars,"" both books are well written and are enhanced by excellent photographs.One of the books deals primarily with general background information which, although should already be standard knowledge for the enthusiast, is well presented. The other focuses on ratings and tasting notes for some of the great Habanos; these notes being highly personal albeit quite interesting and informative.This edition is a great addition to any Habanos connoisseur's library."
4,Good for newbie,"Great description about how to appreciate cigar (look, feel, taste). You won't find such information in other book. Good for newbie."
2,Ok toy. Not really worth it.,I thought this would be more than it is. Its four (or so) wooden pages (boards) with one circular hole in each page in which you insert the same round peg (the sun). My 18 mos old has shown little interest.
5,Guilty pleasure,"Fun and frothy, a great guilty pleasure. Yes, the books are a little repetitive, and no, it's not War and Peace but it's funny and entertaining and the characters are very likable. It's a little on the racy side as well. Love Hina is a good time and lots of fun. I heart Tama-chan!"
1,Request to refund for incorrect shipment. Never got the refund or the correct item.,I ordered vol 1 of LOVE HINA as a gift for my nephew. When he received the issue-- it was a different volume--- it was number 4 which he had already. I was told they will refund my purchase & ship the correct issue for free. That is very nice -- I thank you very much. I know my nephew will be very happy.Unfortunately - this item was never credited back to me. I have had to reorder it from another source. I gave you plenty of time to make amends. This is a terrible way to do business. I do not recommend Amazon customers to deal with you.I am changing my review to O!
3,Decent beginning.,"Ken Akamatsu, Love Hina vol. 1 (Tokyopop, 1999)Akamatsu (Negima) starts up a new series, and not surprisingly it's about a klutzy guy who finds himself surrounded by beautiful women. A bit sex-obsessed, but quite humorous and well-paced, even in a setup volume like this. A good start. ***"
3,Just one look and it looks pretty idiotic...,"Same, same old formula in almost 90% of all manga ever made in Japan: a nerdy student finds himself surrounded by a whole bunch of young bimbos trying to play teen pregnancy roulette with him. Also, lots of monkeyish slapstick and rather unfunny physical abuse (usually dished out on the poor innocent kid by those psycho females hotly accusing him of sexual harassment) thrown in to pad it up. Nothing new.Guess it's just a ""self-serving"" guy thing. (Shrug) Nice art, though."
4,Very good!,"Very funny storyline, hope to get the second! i recommend it! Note: only problem is it was a quick read!"
4,Good lighthearted fun,While I don't rank this up there at the top of my manga list it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It's fun and funny and doesn't take itself too seriously. If you're looking for some of the best manga then this isn't it. But if you're looking to just enjoy yourself then this is all you.
4,"Good, good, good","If you want a light and easy-to-read manga, then this series fits the description. Love Hina is a somewhat different style of manga, drawing-wise. It's softer to the eyes and light in content. Not to say that it isn't aggressive at some parts; there is some level of violence within the pages. However it is not too pushy. It's a fun read and it makes you laugh out loud. The drawings are cute, unique, and entertaining. If the plot became serious there is always a comic relief.The first book is just like the majority of introductory books in a series- mediocre. However as the series builds on I found it more likeable.If you have a sense of humor, this is your series."
2,Bombastic and painful,"It feels as though I am reading a 250 page essay. The writing is unbearably wordy and choppy (run-on sentences and breaks in thought, frequent listing, etc.) I would only recommend this to those who are extremely passionate about government, otherwise it will be slow and painful."
4,"Durable, Adorable ""John Deere Gator Song!""",We bought this for our 16-month-old son and it's a winner! He and my four-year-old fight over it often. This ride on toy is durable. His favorite part of the Gator is the theme song that plays when you push the button. This ride on is small though and really is for under two in my opinion.
4,Great overall quality,This is a sturdy product. I would have submitted five stars but the handle bars were not in alignment when the front tire was straight ahead. Not a safely issue but we expected top quality for the price. It was too late to return and reship a perfect model for Christmas.
1,crack piston,I replace my old caliper with this one about a month I decide to check may brakes-what do you know the piston was cracked.I will not buy another centric caliper.
4,Slicker than the last,"This song, which I quite liked, shows us a new and inspiring Craig David.He couldn't have done it better than this.He can be proud of this cd, on which you can dance, cry, laugh etc."
4,Solid biography,"I think the Alan Walker series has become the definitive biographical work on Liszt. Walker does not reach any staggering new insights about the man's character, but he is a stickler for accurate evidential detail (witness his exhaustive exploration of the infamous but apocryphal ""Beethoven kiss""), and provides a great number of intriguing anecdotes that help the history to come alive. If Walker seems a bit enamored of his subject, he can hardly be blamed -- it is, after all, a weakness common to all biographers, and in this case doubly so: Liszt really seems to have been about the nicest man in the history of classical music.One should not look here for an in-depth critique of Liszt's merits as a composer, but for straight biography, Walker's work is unimpeachable."
3,it lacked depth,"I read this novel by Ms. Moorman and while it is a good storyline, it lacks the depth that usually keeps me reading a story and, even more importantly, telling others about it. I'm sure that Ms. Moorman's style is a good one, but it does not have the rich description of the character's emotions that I feel is necessary to truly draw you into the story. Everyone seemed kind of stiff and 2 dimensional. I hope that this comment is helpful to Ms Moorman, and I hope that she spends a little more time in character development and a little less time on street names and directions."
4,It Works Well,"Bought a version 4 for $5 at Ollie's. Does everthing I could conceive of and more. First star chart I have used that could be adjusted to show exactly how the sky looks. If you are interested in astronomy and have a laptop then this is a must have.CD worked well in an old cd drive, but I had to polish out scratches before it would work in a new DVD drive."
1,Customer service rates an F,My son received Planetarium Gold from his Grandmother as a Christmas gift. We had a problem with the CD and contacted the manufacturer (Fogware). They absolutely refused to help us. My son was very disappointed and I am too. Not a good company to work with... I gave them one star because zero wasn't a choice.
5,"Delicate, but your baked goods are perfect. Everytime.","Love this muffin pan. I've been using it for about 6 months now. The size is just right for that ""professional muffins"" look, kind of like Costco... actually, these might be a little smaller than the Costco size, but they still look fantastic. The aluminum turns out just the right heat output, which was exactly what I wanted, as those dark non-stick pans get too hot and even at the right temp my pastries tend to come out darker. Just spray a little Baker's Joy on the insides of this pan and you're good to go. My one and only gripe is that they are very very THIN- that was a surprise. Sturdy, they are not. I love what it does to my muffins, but if you accidentally bump it or press down too hard or whatever on the pan, it can get bent or dinged VERY easily. I speak from experience here... so just treat them right and they should last for ages AND turn out perfectly baked goods everytime!"
3,It's just ok,"I received the pan, and as soon as I opened the box and pulled it out, I was surprised at how lightweight and flimsy it looked. Definitely not a heavy duty pan. However, it does the job making jumbo muffins. Just don't bang it around or store it in the kitchen around the heavier pans, it might get bent or dented."
3,"Love The Pix, Poster is OK","Love these famous poses of Marilyn. The poster quality is just OK. The top 2 pictures, you can obviously tell it was printed with a color printer because her hair looks really one dimensional and the colors look as though it was a smaller picture that was stretched to the poster size.However, I'm really not that picky when it comes to this kind of thing. I love the poses and the shipping was really fast. I hung this with a thin black frame and have it in my bedroom, near my closet."
4,A haunting little book.,"Miss Wendell seems to have the market cornered on intellegent necrophilia,she lacks the hysterics of many other writers in her field, while losing none of the aching beauty that her subject requires. I would feel sorry for Miss Wendell, but with such a faithful and empathetic lover it's hard to not envy her."
4,"Look very nice, but..","The shoes were very nice. They would be very beautiful to wear with jeans. They'd go well with casual than work outfits. However, the pair that was sent to me was defective. One side looked like it was tried on too many times. Somewhere on the bed of the shoe has a bit of a crack that hurt my foot. Then, I didn't exchage because Amazon was out of these (the price was reduced to about $20 for a pair of rockport!). I wish I did not have to return them, though."
4,cute and comfortable,"I love it the minute I received it. although a little small to the true size, I get used to it after wearing them a couple of times. It goes pretty well with my long coat"
5,Insieme a Te by Alessandro Safina,"This singer is a too well kept secret. He has a wonderful listening voice. A tenor of great depth and color. We need more of his work. He brings a fresh voice to the world of Pavarotti, DiSteffano and Domingo."
5,My 5 yr. old LOVES it!!!!,I would just like to say that my daughter loves riding her Barbie Jeep that her Dad I bought for her 5th Birthday. We were VERY HAPPY to see that the jeep doesn't spin going up the small hills in the back yard and that the battery seems to hold out for a GOOD 3+ hours even on high. It also taught her to look behind her so that she doesn't run over her sister that rides a bike. I hope this helps some of you out on this info.
1,"Poor Production, No voice.","This is just another Televisa Product, with no talent and NO Voice, what a waste of money so search for something more authentic, she's defenetly not a Singer, Stay with the Soaps Paty, Music its not your field."
4,It Works Great,For those of you mid aged gentlmen looking for a natural way to stimulate your sexual experiance i would recomend thisproduct. It works well just be carful and dont use too much gives a bad headache for me. I take one tablet about 30minbefore sex and WoW it works well.
1,Warning - False Advertising!,"Don't belive the information in the product description. If you follow the link and read the pdf file, you'll see that this plan doesn't cover the things that the product description claims it does. If you break it, they won't fix it. If weather causes damage, you're out of luck.Basically this plan will extend the manufacturer's warranty for an extra 2 years, but that's it."
4,probably a bargain,"I called the 800 number at 2AM on a Tuesday just to get an idea of the kind of service to expect. In about a minute a friendly-sounding man took the call, which is impressive. I told him why I was calling and he patiently answered a couple of questions. Since I wasn't an actual customer, I didn't want to take too much of his time grilling him on the service. It seems to be a good extension of the manufacturer's warranty for a low price. If I buy a camera with this plan and have to use the plan, I'll let you know how it goes."
2,I wish I had known this,"I ordered this as a gift for someone who is a die hard Lode Runner fan. She was very excited to get the game, but doesn't play it very often because you can NOT save your progress. Each time you play you have to start over from level one and that's not so fun when you get to an upper level that is really hard to beat."
2,"Nice Bag, Bad Construction.",Well organized & lots of room for things. Cheap materials used in construction so the bag tears around seams and zippers after normal usage. I would definately buy this bag again if it was constructed better.
2,Don't Bother,"I initially liked this bag (or rather I liked having a backpack diaper bag), however one of the zippers quickly started to rip and the bag is now totally useless. Save your money and buy a better quality bag."
3,almost great,"I really like this bag. We purchased it for travel then it became the daycare bag. Unfortunately, it began to tear where the strap attaches to the bag. The zipper also began to pull apart. If Baby Trend used a better quality fabric, this would be the perfect diaper bag - plenty of room, and easy to find what you need."
2,Happy at first...... Not any more,"I got this bag as a gift for my shower, I was very excited. It was perfect and fit everything I needed. well in a matter of last two weeks the left strap riped from the bag. I am left handed and use that side more often. I know have a 8 inch rip in the bag and it is useless. I am very disapointed, because baby tread got great rating on everything else."
5,Great diaper bag,This has been the perfect diaper bag. The extra bag inside has been great to still use as a toiletries bag for vacations for our daughter. I used this bag for 18 months and would buy it all over again without any hesitation. Great price too & my husband had no problem carrying it.
2,Falling to pieces,My husband and I bought this because we liked all the compartments and additional features. It pulled and ripped at the seams were the zippers were very quickly. Of course we packed it like any other diaper bag but not to the point were it should have fallen apart so quickly. I wrote to the company on their email and should have got a response within 48 hours and 2 weeks later have still not even gotten a response.
1,"LIFEless, succorless pap","This game does not teach any life lessons, as the older (1960s) version did. You never worry about getting poor, or making errors, because everything always turns out well in this politically-correct version that dumbs down our children.Don't buy it. Get the older version on internet auction, yard sale or thrift store. It's much more fun and educational. Hasbro, are you listening?Durability: This is as durable as any other board game. No real complaints in that department."
2,Get a Life,"I was highly disappointed to find out I did not buy ""The Game of Life""; what I did buy was a garbeage re-make of a one-time favorite game. If you like the original, go and find an original. This is a watered-down, no offense, travesty of a game. The career ""options"" aspect of the game doesn't even make sense. If you want a different game than the original, get this game, you may enjoy it. Just remember, the only thing that is the same as the original is the name."
3,"well, 3 years is a bit misleading on extended wrty period","because it overlaps the manufacturers warrenty period. On the other hand, it shows that it covers stuff the manf wrty does not (?) during the first year in the chart. For the price it's a good deal. That's said withhout having to use it yet."
2,Works well but has an overpowering scent,"Dogs, particularly long-haired breeds, often suffer from a dry coat that is prone to matting. Once the hair is matted, it is stressful and often painful for the dog to have the tangles brushed from its coat. Applying a spray conditioner to the dog after bathing it and before brushing it go a long way in preventing matting and also help ease dry skin.Although this conditioner did help make my dog's hair look great and make removing the tangles easier, I do not plan to purchase it again. I found the scent to be unpleasant, overpowering and long-lasting."
1,Cheapo for a Rolodex product--do not buy,"The item seemed nice as I was pulling it out of the box, until one of the metal leg bases that should have been affixed to the underside of this shelf was already broken and loose in the package. I glued that one on and when I assembled all of the legs to the bases another one came off and I had to glue it too. Do not buy this item."
5,Getting Answers!,"I have been a student of dreams for many years, but Dream Messages really inspired me to get more out of my dreams. While the writing got a bit awkward at times--with each author speaking in the 3rd person, the examples they shared shed new light on this ancient art of understanding dreams. Since incorporating some of their suggestions, I have gone back to my dream journal to decipher some dreams that seems too obscure before. One gem that is particularly helpful is to ask for a specific dream--so simple! Working with this technique reminds me that heaven and earth really ARE connected, and that I can consciously cooperate with the guidance I am being given. Well done, ladies!Lorraine Seeley Buell--Author of Shipmates"
4,A very good cd!,"This is a very good cd. It's not their best, but it holds it own. It's a classic recording that illustrates the christmas spirit. I really enjoyed this cd and I am glad I got it!"
4,Eye candy,"I got this film on the recommendation of some of my Chinese roommates who suggested that it would be a fun learning tool for helping me learn Mandarin. They were right! It's a story of a lady who has trouble finding love and, when she finally finds it, lets it rapidly get away from her. It's a funny and playful film to watch and the main actress, Loletta Lee, is absolute eye candy! The DVD has it's audio in Mandarin and Cantonese, but includes English subtitles that sometimes, unfortunately, fall well short of being intelligible English. However, this doesn't inhibit understanding the film. It's a good DVD to pop in when you are looking for some simple laughs and beautiful women."
4,Pretty Good Movie,Well if you are into nudity then this is a great movie for you. It has many love seens to keep you interested. I have let other friends borrow this and they have all agreed that it was a good movie.
5,Great Blade for Cutting Aluminum,"I used this blade to cut aluminum frames that were 1 inch wide by 7/16 inch deep in various lengths. The frames were used to make solar screens that reduce the amount of heat that radiates into the house created by the window glass , thereby, reducing the cost of cooling the rooms affected. The blade made a very smooth, clean mitered cut. I could have used a hacksaw and miter box, but I had 40 cuts to make, and doing it by hand was going to take more time and effort than necessary. This was my first time making solar screens, and using this blade assisted me in doing a really good job. I finished screens for 10 windows in a day. They are up and secured; they look professionally made and really do reduce substantially the transfer of radiated heat into the rooms. Thanks Freud for making a excellent blade."
3,mesh watch band,The watchband was as described but it was too large for my watch. That is my fault because I misunderstood the mm measurement.
3,NOT FOR LEFT HANDED CHILD !!!,This toy was designed for a right handed child. The writing tool is stored in the top binder of the toy (great idea) but it is on the right side only along with the string that attaches the crayon to the toy that is also on the right side of the toy. My daughter (2yrs old) cannot write because the string gets in her way. I have called Mattel to see if they have a left handed toy and they do not. Not a good choice if you have a left handed child.
3,EASILY DAMAGED!,"I was not careful enough and the writing screen was damaged when it was in contact with a very soft rubber ball. They do warn you to be careful with it, but it is extremely easy to damage. Now its wreaked and I have to throw it away because there is a print of the ball on the screen and it cannot be fixed. My almost 3-yr old did like it for the 2 days that it lasted......"
3,just okay,"This books has beautiful pictures of groupings of different kinds of plates with a very brief history of each category (with limited samples of each kind). However, I thought it was a little thin. I read the book and looked at all the pictures thoroughly in less than an hour. Instead of a book, this item is more of a glorified magazine in small formatI wanted a more thorough book. I wanted something I could refer to over and over again. I'm going to go search for another book to use in addition to this one."
4,nice oil for hair,It is very nice smell and feel relaxing. after I used this oil on my hair when I touched and brushed my hair so smooth and shiny. I feel my hair heathly now.
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WEN products-hair conditioner -terrible mess. First week or so it was okay but then beyond that there was no sense of cleanliness, my hair is coarse and thick and it was awful-did not do a thing it promised,made it dry and more coarse and awfulthumbs down-sorry!"
1,Not worth it,Several co-workers and I would like to express our disappointment with this book. We have lot's of Mechanical Desktop experience and are trying to learn Inventor. This book was of no help.
4,"Ok, but not much help.","If you need help building drawers, then this will help. If you need help actually attaching them to your cabinets, then I hope it helps you more than it did me. I had to get professional help, which people have said I have needed for years."
1,Book was water damaged,Boo was water damaged and mostly useless. I did get the one recipe I needed out of the book so it was not a complete loss.
4,excellent but...,"This is an excellent CD. The reason I give just 4 stars is because it doesn't have enough information about the artist and the album release or the songs composers. You got to blame of course the CD industry and a deficient art design. However, this CD is a very good introduction to the beautiful voice and talented expression of Muñiz. The CD have classic versions, new versions, and duo song (one with José José and other with Pedro Vargas--I guess, because there is no information on the CD). The CD is an excellent blend of modern boleros y baladas, and includes also a ranchera. Forget Luis Miguel, Muñiz singing shows a passion that you will never get from Luis Miguel. Among the songs, I will highlight Muñiz' classics, ""Escándalo"" or ""Que murmuren"" and ""Por amor"". There is also new interesting versions }of ""Palabras de mujer"". Baladas like ""Amada Amante"" and a beautiful version of Victor Manuel ""Quiero abrazarte tanto""."
1,Horrible!,I thought this album was a total waste of money. They did absolutely nothing for me and did nothing to keep the memory of the Bee Gees alive and well. I have heard other tribute bands who did a much better job and offered more for the money.
2,Disappointing rehash of old information,"As the classic antivivisection books (Cruel Deception, Animal Liberation, etc.) become more and more dated, the need for an up-to-date account of vivisection today is urgently needed. I therefore eagerly ordered this book.I was sorely disappointed to find that Harvest of Shame consists almost entirely of old information recycled from other antivivisectionist books. Furthermore, the style, while poetic and passionate, also rambled quite a bit.If you want to learn more about vivisection, I'd suggest either the ""classics"" I mentioned above, or better, for the technically inclined, go to the scientific journals and see for yourself how cruel and pointless modern vivisection really is."
4,Heavy but powerfully life changing!,"Cracking the Parenting Code: 6 Clues to Solving the Mystery of Meeting Your Child's NeedsJohn doesn't mess around. This book was hard hitting--like many of his other books--but then again, that is why I have read everyone of his books. I love his biblical insight and straight forward, no nonsense approach. This book has helped me delve into the calling for which God had designed for me. Thanks John!"
4,It is a book about being set free from Intimidation!,It is a book about people who have been intimidated either part of their life or most of their life. It is a book about when a person has a psychological over-powering control over another human being. The only lord of a person's life should be Christ - but if a person is walking on eggshells because of the actions of another person - then they need to be set free and realize the freedom they have in Christ - rather than being eternally intimdated. That is what this book is about.
3,Ship date,"Product was as stated, but ship date was not as indicated on email. Ship date was about a week or so later according to the post date on package. NO problems other that that."
5,I love it,"The book helps me to break intimidating feelings easily without hesitation. Thanks God, the examples are clear and concise based on Bible."
2,How to Make an Island Paradise Seem Boring,"Lutz writes an eighty page encyclopedia entry, giving you everything you ever wanted to know about this Pacific island, while proving he did not step foot on the island. The photographs seem to be from the 1960's, despite the 1987 book copyright date. The Guamanians are portrayed as backward and overly reliable on the government to cure its ills. Although this site lists this as a kids book, your child will be bored silly."
2,David Arnold - 007 Project,"I was a little disappointed with this compilation. I am a fan of David Arnold and had read earlier reviews on this CD, in fact it was recognition of this compilation by Bond composer, John Barry that helped Arnold get the gig. His work in all the Bond films he's composed for has been excellent, but I found some of these renditions a little too experimental and abstract to completely enjoy. I dont think I would have purchased it had I heard it entire beforehand."
3,Good CD if you're planning a James Bond party,"Bond goes Techno-pop. I enjoy a little more than half of the tracks on this CD. Great for my Bond party, but I doubt I'll keep this CD in regular rotation otherwise. It is a good companion to the 30th Anniversary Bond CD, and it's worthwhile for diehard Bond fans to add to their collection."
2,Picture is deceiving,"This picture is deceiving as the light fixture hangings way lower than it looks in the picture. I couldn't use it for the purpose I bought it for because it hangs too low. I was very difficult to assemble, as the decorative screws provided were too short to ""grab"" the threads very well; therefore, it can't be picked up anywhere except by the center pole because all the screws holding the scroll work pull out if you put any weight on them. The white finish on the lamp shade comes off all over you when you handle it, so I can't imagine that it will hold up very well. It is attractive to look at, but I wasn't impressed with the quality."
4,Vetta Bike Speedometer,"This is a replacement for a Vetta RT55 that died after six months. It does not have as many features; however, the two line display is adequate."
1,Don't buy this,This model is missing basic features like average speed. You can find one with more features for a similar price.
2,Terrible transfer - product should be dropped,"The film is a low budget production, but about what you would expect... I wasn't particularly impressed with the script or the production values, but overall, acceptable. The problem is the DVD transfer. It may be the worst I have ever seen. Reel changes remain visible, the color is washed out, and the audio becomes garbled to the point where one can barely follow the plot in the last scenes of the film. Amazon should drop this product until the distributors remaster the DVD."
2,Inferior,"This film is poorly directed and acted. It's maudlin. The DVD transfer is the worst I have ever seen.The scenes of Jerusalem are interesting and quite beautiful, however."
3,Just okay,It is evident that this is a low budget movie and the script was poor. I wanted to stop it about half way through because the story line just started to repeat itself and there was nothing else to the plot. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the fact that children don't judge one another like adults do and it is nice to see that they can look beyond the cultural and religious barrier and be friends.
