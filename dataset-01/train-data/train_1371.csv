2,"Little style, less substance.","A made-for-TV ""Thomas Crown Affair (1968)"" tries hard to duplicate the Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway chemistry, using Donald Sutherland and Jennifer O'Neill in this watery version.Role reversal sets O'Neill as the wealthy jewel thief, hunted seductively by insurance investigator Sutherland..who works most of the film in shirts open to the navel...Ahh, the 70's!O'Neill is beautiful and stylish, drives fast cars, swims unclothed and stays away from complex sentences, while Sutherland smokes those little thin cigars and from time to time falls back on his `Hawkeye' grin. There is a nice turn by Jon Cypher as the heavy. Soap opera vet Eric Braeden gets some on-screen time as does, of all people Robert Duvall as the straight-arrow cop.Fun for a lark. Connoisseurs of the genre only please."
5,Another Great 2pac Album,"Tupac is an amazing poet and any true Pac fan knows this. If you have the book, this album brings it to life. Although no one can do it like Pac, this is a wonderful collaboration. The legacy of Tupac Shakur lives on through this album. Long live Makaveli the Don!!!"
2,This isn't a Tupac album.,"This should have been called ""A Collection of poems written by Tupac, read by others"". The man him self is on the LP about 45 seconds, and that's it. There is some good music on here, but it doesn't belong on an album that makes it look as though Tupac performs the poems. If you are looking for new previously unreleased Tupac songs, look elsewhere. He doesn't even rap on this LP. If you are trying to collect every one of his albums, make this the last one you buy."
3,"Not radio hits, but songs to make you think",This album will make you think about many topics that Tupac wrote about and thought on...too bad the message does not get pushed enough...get past the Thug Life
3,"the CD is OK, the book is much better","i'm real big on 2pac, but this CD just doesn't do it for me. some of the tracks are tight, like the outlawz interpretation of ""in the event of my demise"" and the mos def tracks. but other than that, i didn't find the CD too appealing cuz 2pac isn't on it (except for a brief interlude in the beginning). a great tribute to a legend, but the book is much much better since you get to read the direct work of 2pac. MOB."
3,"ONCE A ROSE, NOW A GARDEN","THIS 25 TRACK CD IS OK. IT IS 2PAC'S POEMS PERFORMED BY OTHER ARTISTS LIKE DEAD PREZ, OUTLAWZ, AND MORE. A FEW GOOD SONGS LEAD BY AN INTRODUCTION BY 2PAC. IF YOU SEE IT, GRAB IT, JUST TO ADD ON TO YOUR COLLECTION. NOT THE GREATEST TUPAC MATERIAL."
2,come on man this ain't pac,"i know every1 is going to hate hearing this but this is my opinion... i know all these so called great artists and actors took pac's written words and made music and poetry out of it, which is nice and all but its not worth your money to buy this. If you know what pac was saying in his lyrics then you know he would of wanted some of his real homiez put down some things for him and give their piece of mind instead of the cast of LION KING. Although I know the outlawz and mac mall are on here with a couple of others, but I would loved to hear some real gz put down some stuff for him that had rolled with him to the end. So in my opinion its not worth the money."
2,Not good enough!,"As an mc 2pac was special and the poems on this album are good, but it does not feel right to hear it read by Danny Glover or even Q-Tip. The book was great but this CD should have remained unreleased. I am looking forward to the next double-cd from Amaru/Death Row which will be released before April 1st. Better be tight!"
4,Good CD,"It seems like that anything tupac touches becomes gold...this project from amaru records on tupac poetry is another must have for pac fans everywhere....thanks to guest appearances from the outlawz, mos def, q-tip, mac mall, etc this cd is not as boring as you might think by just reading what this cd is about....the tracks from this cd is not just about poetry reading, there are also singings and rapping included and the beats are pretty good too...the best tracks in this cd are ""in the event of my demise"" (great performance by outlawz, nice beat), ""starry night"" (QD III once again produced another dope track for us), the title song(r&b singing), and ""family tree""....overall a good album but if u only like rap think twice about buying it"
2,Love Tupac,This album wasn't as good as I was hoping for. Tupac was a legend and reading his poetry helps see deeper inside his soul. It is basically a cd you might listen to once or twice and thats about it. My two favourite tracks are Wife for life and In the event of my demise!! I would only recommend this to true tupac fans who just really love anything related to tupac!! Its nice to have in a collection is all!!!
5,Just Awesome,"Have u ever read a book that you think is just great? Well this book is one of them books. Tupac Shakur was just amazing with both his poetry and his music sometimes his music what you would call the cleanest but he had a point for what he was saying in all of it. This book is one of the best poetry books that i've ever read, If u like to listen to Rap music or are a Tupac Shakur fan then you will deffitaly like this book. Tupac in this book is just amazing he says things that will just stop and make you think about what is really going on in life and how much bad things there is that goes on in this world. Tupacs' poetry is a must read tho."
1,His Mom needs to do some re-thinking,"This is awful. Not Pac's poetry but the way his mom laid it out. It's terrible...if 2pac were to do this THIS IS NOT HOW HE WOULD DO IT. I mean the way some of the people read it over the beats is NOT the way they are to be read--and it is painfully obvious. One track is even a complete country song....country beat...country singer. The only thing tight about this is the track ""In The Event Of My Demise""."
1,This CD is a pathetic tribute to an incredible artist.,"It really is a pathetic tribute to a increadible artist. Tupac deserves more than this half job, weak tribute. I'm a huge 2Pac fan, and I'm telling you personaly, don't buy this CD. This isn't a 2Pac CD, and it shouldn't be called one, becuase he would never make such a horrible CD."
5,A GREAT ALBUM FROM A GREAT ARTIST,"I KNOW MOST ""WANNA BE"" PAC FANS WILL NOT LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU ARE TRUE TO HIM YOU WILL LOVE IT. IT IS THE ALBUM THAT PAC WOULD HAVE TELEASED IF HE HAD NOT DIED RIP. THE SONGS ARE TIGHT AND THE WHOLE ALBUM IS TRUE PAC TO THE CORE. EVEN THE COUNTRY SONG IS GOOD TO LISTEN TO SO BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Another 2pac,"This CD is just totally rubbish,just some friends and relatives reading 2pac's old lyrics. Just invest your money in other better CDs"
5,Great Boots,"I went to several HD locations to check out riding boots. I like to touch and feel the product before ordering online. I settled on this boot because I like the quick tie hooks on the last 4 places when tying my shoes. I don't like the side zippers. This has been the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. I wear them every day, all day, not just when I'm riding. I've had them over a year now and when they wear out I will be buying another pair. Amazon had the best price I could find online and considerably cheaper than a HD shop."
5,Probably the most durable footwear I've ever owned,"It's been 5 years since I purchased these boots, so consider this review comprehensive. These boots lasted me 4 years of continuous wear before the sole glue finally gave way (which I superglued an additional 6 months).They are incredibly tough, resilient, and great for everyday wear. I've done everything from dance to kick people and things in these and they've held up rock solid. They walk well, and are great for average sized feet.I'm ordering a second pair, and hope for another 4 years of easy wear."
5,"Harley-Davidson Men's Dipstick Boot,Black,",These boots are very nice. They are comfortable and made of quality materials. They are the size they say they are so order your size.
2,They are not Universal,Before you buy these for your speakers please research on whether they will fit. They seem durable and well made but they are not Universal and never actually fit on my speakers.
3,What can the average person learn from OBE/NDE?,"A Glimpse of Heaven is a wonderful book, but so many people just focus on their own lessons they learned, which makes for an interesting story, but I am always looking for more - how does this apply to me? Do I have to have an NDE myself? I liked Tiffany Snow's book better, just one chapter about her great NDE, but the rest of it shows how anyone can open up, if they learn how. I'm not saying A Glimpse of Heaven is a bad book, really, but I guess I was just expecting more."
5,Very thought provoking...an excellent read,"This book provided insight into the minds of the senior leaders of the military. It provided me w/a framework to continually develop and improve my own leadership abilities. I highly recommend this book, not only to new and current officers,(I have given my copy to my Platoon Leader) but to ALL enlisted men and women serving as NCOs, in the U.S. military. The information provided in this text can be utilized by ANYONE desiring to improve their leadership abilities. This book by Puryear has me wanting more, and now I must read his previous book ""19 Stars""."
1,WAS a long term Ryobi User,"I've had the Ryobi string trimmer for about seven years. Finally wore out the old one and had such a great experience with no problems over the years that I decided to purchase a new 775r. First one I received had a bad clutch. Sent it back to Amazon who readily replaced it. The new one sent had a seized engine. Never ran out of the box because it came out seized. Not sure what's happening with Ryobi but stay away from this company and product. Until this experience I would've sworn by them. Reading some of the other reviews, I'm not the only one who's been let down by the company.I wrote an email to the folks at Ryobi and got a form email response.Buyer Beware."
1,775R TRIMMER PLUS.,I HAVE PURCHASED THIS ITEM 2 TIMES IN THE PAST 2 YEARS WITH THE SAME RESULTS. QUALITY OF THE 2 CYCLE ENGINE IS VERY POOR. THE ONLY REASON I PURCHASED THE 2ND TIME WAS I ALREADY HAD ALL OF THE ATTACHMENTS . I THOUGHT THE FIRST WAS ONLY BAD LUCK BUT THE SECOND ONLY LASTED 6 MONTHS AND WAS ONLY USED ABOUT 2 HRS . TOTAL. THIS IS MY LAST RYOBI UNIT. MY YARD IS LESS THAN 1/2 ACRE AND ONLY USED ON THE EDGE OF THE GRASS WITH NO TREES TO TRIM AROUND. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.THE FINS ON THE FLYWHEEL WHICH COOLS THE ENGINE COMES APART AND DAMAGES THE STARTER MECH. AND ENGINE.
2,Discolored after one wash,The briefs got a slight off white color after only one wash. I have not seen this problem in the past.
3,Does not fit well for in-between sizes,My waist is 32 1/2'' but they don't have a size from 32 - 34.They have size 30-32 and 34-36. Size 30-32 feels too tight and Size 34-36 feels too loose at the crotch.
2,too tight !,I must be expanding cause these undies are WAY too tight I have other brands that are true to size....
5,Fine,Have used Fruit Of Loom products before and found them to be a good product. Would recommend them to anyone.
1,thumbs down,I ordered this item as in the picture it shows boxer briefs. I got the order and it was regular briefs.Its misleading to show boxer briefs and send regular briefs.If you order this item it is regular briefs not as the picture shows. thankyou ! ! !
3,ok not to shbby,"not what i really expected but i do guess that this will have to do, woop d woop , boo yahne questions call someone who cares"
1,huge,"Fruit of the Loom makes two kinds of briefs-- regular and Big Men's. I ordered regular, but I received Big Men's. They are gigantic! Be careful when ordering."
2,Fruit of the Loins,"My father once said don't be so damn fruity. Well damn you Dad you old dead bastards, I'm in love with a fruit, Fruit of the Loom."
1,was sent wrong item,I ordered briefs like in the picture.. what I received were old style tighty-whity's (or whatever they're called).
2,Not true to size,"I ordered a medium and they seemed awfully big, more like a large.Next time I would probably order a small."
3,too big,The sizing is off..turned out to be bigger than expected. I bought this based on the waist size but it was humongous overall.
2,saggy in the ass...,"I've been a FTL person since i was 3 or 4 years old....These FTL's off of Amazon are total crap...OK, for guys here and maybe a mom who is purchasing for their son...DONT buy these. They bunch up at the A'crack. They feel like they have been used. any Guy knows what i mean when i say Used...It is a total shame...I will not recommend these for anyone. I started wearing Puritan's...Guess I will stay with them now..."
4,Very Good Briefs,"These are really good briefs. I were these under my Levis 501's all the time and they feel fantastic. I skate a lot and these traditional white briefs are hot. They run a little large, but, I find these okay. I sag in jeans sometimes and these are a talking point with my friends and girls as they like the waist band through my jeans. I'm 24 and these are hot undies. Nice! I recommend these to any guy. They are also cool on younger guys as well. Go for these. You won't be disappointed. Well worth the money as well."
3,comfortable and provides good support,"comfortable and provides good supporthowever, even the small size i bought is very tall; it it comes up my waste much higher than i expected and is also higher than other briefs i have bought in the past"
3,shrink after wash,"Fabric is really soft, but it shrinked after wash and dry. I think the size runs small..."
1,BAGGY DRAWERS,"IF YOU NEED TO GO FROM ONE SIZE TO A LARGER SIZE, EXPECT THE SEAT OF THE BRIEFS TO FALL HALF WAY DOWN TO YOUR KNEES, THE MANUFACTURER THINKS JUST BECAUSE SOME ONE GOES FROM A LARGE TO AN XL THEY NEED 4 INCHES LONGER BRIEFS, THAT IS A JOKE, ALL A PERSON NEEDS IS A LITTLE MORE ROOM IN THE WAIST. SOME ONE NEEDS TO WAKE UP AND WISE UP THAT A LARGER SIZED DOES NOT NEED TO BE LONGER."
3,"One size,","The underwear looks good, but it's on a model for just for the one size. I'd kinda like to see what it would look like on a guy like me. Maybe if there were different models for each size it would help a little. But I do know that Fruit of the loom is a good brand to go with."
1,"Label with wrong size, 3x is a 2x!!!!!!!!!!","These are factory rejects, 3X size is really a 2X , dO not expect them to fit properly as they are mislabeled and pass off as being OK, Another amazon exlusive!!!"
5,good briefs,"The briefs didn't make me look like the model in the photo but they do fit well, are comfortable around the legs, are absorbent, remain in place throughout the day, and the fly is easy to use. They wash well, keep their shape, and it was nice to find a size that fits. I can't often find this size in stores and when I do it's an off-brand usually that doesn't wear as well. Overall, it's what I've come to expect from Fruit of the Loom, and think that most guys will like these."
3,better than Hanes,"better than Hanes, which have found their way to the trash pile, but not as good as they were even 5 years ago"
5,"Purchsed for Dad, aged 81",Bought this for my 81 year old father at his request. He has been wearing this brand and style for many many years and will not consider anything else. In the past he would buy them at JCPenny's when he travelled to the USA but now has me order them online for him. We are both happy with the purchase.
1,No apples for Adam? More like no talent for this band!,"There are some terrible sounds in this world. Nails on a chalkboard. That squeaky sound styrofoam makes. William Hung. But the sound that comes out of my speakers when this CD is playing tops all of those. I mean, what is the lead singer thinking? Someone just needs to tell him to stop trying to imitate Jars of Clay. I think a drunk cat with laryngitis could do a better job. I can't believe people actually pay money to buy these things. They make better coasters than CDs."
3,Norman Bates is back to normal but Mothers another story...,"3.5 stars - Reasonably well done second sequel to Hitchcock's masterpiece marks Anthony Perkins' directorial debut. This one plays it tongue in cheek at times- Eg: The sherrif on the lookout for a missing girl helps himself to some ice cubes from Normans motel freezer neglecting to notice that they are bloodied - the girls corpse lies underneath!!. Film is as competent as Psycho's 2 and 4 - just a differing style. Much better than the Psycho remake (1998). If Psycho's 1-4 aren't enough for you, check out Robert Blochs interesting novel 'Psycho House' which was never filmed and is available in paperback from Amazon."
4,Psycho III true to the character & surprisingly good!,"I got into these movies when the original 'Psycho' was released on DVD. Let's be realistic here, it is hard to live up to the masterpiece directed by the master of Maccabre himself - Alfred Hitchock, but don't be too quick to dismiss 'Psycho III'. I found the film VERY entertaining (even more than Psycho II) & I am glad to see others enjoyed it as much as I did. Perkins delivers his role to a tee & its nice seeing him squirm when facing dilemmas spawned by ...well... HIMSELF! Strongly recommended for fans of horror, suspense & the 'Psycho' story line."
1,Unnecessary tripe,"Psycho was an enormous success.Psycho 2 was an excellent original sequel.Psycho 3 is a joke. After an excellent twist at the end (Norman's real mother( the series should have finished on that note. Yes, a sequel could have been made but what would have been the point in rehashing the original idea? Psycho 3 is basically a repeat of Psycho minus the action, camerawork, acting and, oh, pretty much everything else. The plot mirrors practially mirrors Psycho, a woman seeks refuge in a motel but the difference is she falls in love with Norman. However as she grows to know Norman better she starts to suspect things are not as they seem. As the bodies pile up Tracy must decide whether this is the work of Norman or nothing more.Rubbish sequel which I would say has been disowned by now.Better to have a powercut than to watch this mindless drivel."
2,Not My Favorite Psycho Movie!!!,"I loved Psycho with Anthony Perkins, that was a classic and I liked Psycho 2, though it wasn't as good as Psycho and not a classic but still good, as For Psycho 3, I didn't really like it that much, Anthony Perkins was great as always as Norman but I didn't really like the other characters they were kind of annoying, especially the guy who was a total scuzball!"
3,Back to the drawing board,"Norman is having a nice life when a noisy reporter harasses him and a lookalike of one of his prior victims tries to commit suicide at his motel. Things get worse when the corpse of his mother is abducted by his sleasy backwoods desk clerk. When the screenplay is having difficulties making effective use of drama or comedy, some nice FRIDAY THE 13TH style murders do the trick. The scene with Perkins watching WOODY WOODPECKER is hilarious and the end is disturbing in a good way."
1,A Shock to the System!,"Not only is the script and plotline weak, this second sequel to the original is dark, crude, and very gory. As I watched this movie I was thinking to myself....Alfred Hitchcock must be rolling over in his grave!!"
2,It ought to have been much better.,"This film saw the series descend into a sad parody of itself, which is a shame. Only Anthony Perkins emerges from this with his integrity intact, his performance being as believable as his others as Norman Bates. As a director, however, he ought to have known better. The script is weak, relying on comedy and the audience's knowledge of the previous Psycho Films for many of its laughs. By playing it 100% straight, Perkins does not tarnish the role of Bates, which is just as well, because the sequel made much better use of him."
3,3rd best.,"I've always thought part 2 is a better film than this one, but it is actually a much finer film than it's often reputed to be. (The original film is naturally still the best, and forget the remake.) There are a few ""Friday The 13th"" type slasher killings, but the movie continues quite nicely the eerie old house atmosphere one expects. Perkins is wonderful (yet again), Scarwid is perfect as the naive young woman, Gillin's good as the likeable sheriff, and Fahey is right-on as the psychopath never-will-be rock star. Fahey's unjustly been called ""the poor man's Mel Gibson"", but he's a very good and underrated actor, and it only takes one look at his psycho-turn in this one to see upon what Gibson might've been modelling his own future psychos. -And dare I say, thus catapulting himself to become ""the (very) rich man's Jeff Fahey"". Luckily this DVD version is letterboxed, which part 2 strangely enough isn't."
2,Didn't Like This One!!,"I loved the movie Psycho starring Anthony Perkins and I liked the first sequel Psycho II, but I didn't like Psycho III, Anthony Perkins was good as always as Norman Bates but I didn't like the other characters especially the guy who was a total scuzbucket!"
4,"Not as good as part II, but ok.",Wasn't that good as the second one from the series. But its worth a shot.
1,Psycho III,"I know what you did last summer, Norman! There have been many films and TV shows shot at the famous ""Psycho"" set at Universal Studios, but this was the worst. Set not too long after Psycho II (the first pile-of-crap sequel) Norman Bates is back to his old wacko self. The Bates Motel is open for business, again, and his first guest is a suicidal nun...yep! But wait, there's more! She's accompanied by a drunken sleazeball, who Norman hires as a part-time motel clerk (I'm sure it's just because Norman wants to off him first).The movie has some funny scenes in it, but none can hold up to the crappy slasher mentality that later follows. Anthony Perkins' directorial debut - I'm sure that really helped his career."
1,Not very impressive.,"Not very impressive at all. Not only is it not suspenseful, and full of gore but it's directed by Anthony Perkins! If Alfred Hitchcock was still alive, i bet he would be pissed off with this shouse effort."
5,A Road Map for the Quaternionic renaissance,"The quaternionic movement seemingly ran out of steam in the early twentieth century, about the same timethis bibliography was compiled. But the decline of quaternions was not to last forever. They areback again. If for no other reason, quaternions allow for taking quotients that vector algebradoes not recognize. This makes it possible to isolate desired unknowns by partial fractions andcontinued fractions with vector operator arguments. This bibliography reminds me of a map tothe Lost Dutchman's Mine!"
1,"Nothing heavy about it, but I have a bone to pick ...","I bought this CD because of Cats in Boots reference.BAD MISTAKEThe only thing in common between the two albums is the singer.You will hear him in the beginning.The first few songs sounded like Whitesnake > better bandFrankie Banali was way better in Quiet Riot.The album then starts sounding like Led Zeppelin > barfIf you're expecting the CIB sound, forget it.This is a well produced album, but Sammy Hagar does that niche of music way better.Save your money.I'm getting rid of this crap, but CIB is still on the shelf."
3,good little movie,Just a good little movie to keep you busy on a cold and snowy night. good story. i enjoyed it.
1,DISAPPOINTED,I BOUGHT FOR GIFT FOR DAUGHTER BUT I DID NOT GIVE DISAPPOINTED IN TEXT AND PHOTOS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED
5,A fairy fun book filled with rich photographic images!,I bought this book for it's rich photographic images of fairies. I am delighted that Suza Scalora has the talent and vision to see the fairies and help to make them real for the rest of us.
3,"Beautiful, but not real","I paged through the book and the images are definately striking, but not real. The book is beautifully put together and if one wanted to believe, they could. She talks about going around the world and photographing these fairies and how to lure them out. Each fairy has a story. And the different fairies seem to have a dominant color. But once you get to the end, there are ""movie-like"" credits that give credit in regards to ""color, art, wings, design, etc"" so in a way its admitting that its all fake even though the book is described as the first documented images of fairies. That I don't like. If the book is fiction it should be stated somewhere, if she's going to claim that her pictures are real fairies that she caught in the woods all over the world. Besides, the pictures look a little too perfect and set designed to be images caught on camera by chance out in the wilderness! Other than that, the book is great for the vibrant color and beautiful images."
3,"Good book, just know what it is...","It's a great book as long as you aren't to built up for it and no before hand it is not real. It may seem silly but it is so good and the photos were so beautiful, even though you know it could never be real, you sort of think it can and just get swept away and you are ready to go searching for your own fairies because maybe they are real photos...then in the back it has credits for the models and costume makers. It seemed like it was so good it was a big let down at the end. It could just be the fact that in the store they presented it as non-fiction but it is an okay book. I feel silly every time I pick it up because I believed for a little while it was real."
3,"pretty pictures, but i'd skip the text","I really like Scalora's photography, but the text and premise were a bit twee for my taste. An archaeologist travels around the world, snapping photographs of ""real"" faeries: bright, slick, colorful photos of beautiful girls and young women in wings and paint, and not much more. Like I said, the photos are a real treat, but I wouldn't bother with any of the superfluous and unimpressive text: it attempts the whimsy of Brian Froud's faerie manuals, without any of the wry humor and irony that make his books fun to read. As a consequence, it seems to appeal to those readers who like to gush about ""believing"" in ""real faeries"". I do hope that they realize that this book is fantasy, not a field guide.For those interested in seeing more of her work..."
3,Good until I got to the end,"While reading The Fairies I was entranced. It made me actually believe in them! That is until I got to the last page. The credits. They had things like: set design and wings, etc. It was a great disappointment to me and I don't think they should've put it in there. It completely ruined the feeling I had from reading the book."
5,great book highly recommended,What a wonderful book by two you daughters are looking for fairies of their own right now!
3,"Beautiful photography work, but i was very dissapointed","This book was magical and wonderful, until the very end when I read the credits and thank yous, in which it lists the names of the ""fairies"" and the company who created the ""ice glacier"". Maybe I'm just a very naive person, but I actually believed that she did set across the world and take pictures of real fairies, and not just dress people up to look like fairies and say she photographed them in a forest in brazil or wherever. The pictures themself were beautiful, but I just wish she hadn't lied about it all, and faked her quest. I'm sorry to say that I will be returning my book."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I had bought the book recently and just finished reading it. I thought it would be REAL pictures of fairies, instead of humans pretending to be fairies. The stories behind the pictures are what gives this book three stars. I loved reading about the fairies, just wish she would have used real pictures. :("
4,request more remastering,"It is great to finally hear a lot of these songs without the snap crackle pop of the turn table. I look forward to Uni/A&M's (unanounced) remastered re-release of Rick's first three albums. Don't know if that is in the works, so may I urge you to visit Uni/A&M's website and request as much on the comment page. If they would only sound like the quality available in this Recollections work, and have restored artwork..."
5,Why is this book out of print?,"The ideas which she explores are as relevant today as they were when this book was first published in 1963. While some facts have changed (for example, the Soviet Union no longer existing), the pressures on young people have changed little. She was a strong believer in people taking responsibility for themselves and their world, but realised that certainly at the time of writing the general education of young people was not giving them enough of an opportunity to think for themselves. It would be a safer, kinder world if more people were to take on the ideas presented by Eleanor Roosevelt in this book."
1,don't buy these,"I purchased this replacement filter/wick for our humidifier this year and all I can say is, it doesn't work. First, the construction of the media is very open -- which I thought meant that it would function better than our older wicks. Not so. These filters aren't strong enough to support the weight of the air funnel in the humidifier or their own weight -- when wet. They also don't wick enough water up into themselves to humidify the air. I ran our humidifier on high for eight hours last night. The humidity level in the house was 20% and the humidifier consumed about two quarts of water. Using our old wicks, the humidifier reservoir would have been almost empty. I'm looking online now trying to find our old wicks."
3,Interesting,"Personally my favorite tracks on this album are U &I, Natalie, Playing Games,Right Now and I'll Never Hurt You Again. Al B Sure snapped off on the song U & I and it my favorite song on this whole CD."
3,It's Not His Best BUT...,"Al B. Sure! is an one of the artists who filled the 90's with a classic sound. Sexy Versus didn't do for him what Forever My Lady did for Jodeci. But the one song that is truly timeless is the song, ""Natalie"". I could listen to it now and help set the mood. The song is a ballad that brings back pleasant memories. Very intimate. But the rest of the album is dated. Sorry..."
5,Customer Satisfaction Review,I am very satisfied with the delivery of my recent order on the Al B. Sure! Sexy Versus CD. The service from Amazon is very awesome and the CD came delivered in excellent condition. I am very pleased with my order and customer service from Amazon. I'll continue to do future orders on items that I may not be able to find anywhere else!!! I highly recommend Amazon to everyone!!!
5,Healthier Alternative to Goldfish Snack Crackers,We absolutely love these little crackers. They are a much healthier alternative to Goldfish Snack Crackers. The expiration date on the crackers gives us a year to consume the case ordered. Very satisifed with the purchase. Free shipping brings the total per box approx $1.00 below grocery store prices.
1,great product - horrible price,great product but you can easily buy for well under $2.50 at many grocery stores
5,Spot Remover Excellent,"I have used this product for 13 years now and love it! The location I bought it from at that time has stopped carrying this product so I now order it on line. I highly recommend this product to anyone that has spots on clothes from everything, grease, inkpen, lipstick, mustard, blood, etc. It has removed so many spots over the years. Be very careful with some dark colors like blues test an area first. But just so you know I use it on blacks all the time and no fading just on some blues be careful. all other colors are excellent results also. Hope this product helps you as much as it has helped me."
1,"seriously, save your money","If you have a real yard and think electric tools are toys, buy a real power tool and not this piece of junk. The edger is a joke and I stripped the gears on the second use.I won't get this repaired because I don't have time to make the same mistake twice and can admit when I made a dumb purchase.I will go to a lawn mower store next time..."
2,Great - if you ever get it started.,"Holy Cow. I've often thought of having the entire neighborhood come over to ""lay hands"" on the TrimmerPlus praying it will start when I'm ready to use it. Starting it is a complete nightmare. HOWEVER, IF and when you do get it started, I love the tiller, the string trimmer and the edger (which works fine)."
1,"First year was fine, subsequent years are trouble","I received this trimmer as a present so I knew nothing about the quality of Ryobi. The trimmer worked very well for its first season. The EZ attachment makes this one unit very versatile as I quickly purchased the edger attachment. I used the trimmer and the edger without difficulty for the summer. However, during the second season, I continually had to leave the choke on in order for the engine to run. The performance and power level is drastically hampered with the choke on. I added the leaf blower attachment during the second season to assist with the leaves. Even with the choke running, the blower worked well.The engine is not built well on the 725r. I have taken it apart to clean it thoroughly; however, the performance has not improved. I would not recommend this unit due to the lack of engine quality. I am looking at replacing this unit with a Troy-built one that accepts the EZ attachments I have already purchased."
1,Do not use edger!,"It works as a weed trimmer, but it is hard to start. Do not plan on edging with it! After having the shaft replaced many times under warranty, Ryobi finally admitted to me that the split shaft can not handle edging. The torque is too much. At first they had said, ""Just one of those things."" Then, ""Gee, you are having bad luck."" Then ""You must be using it professionally."" I am not. Now they tell me they realize that the edger does not really work, but it is out of warranty, and they are a different company now. I much prefer the hand-me-down electric edger I have now."
4,Great Resource,"For me, the most interesting part are the non-NT texts. It would be nice if there was a bit more commentary and explanation, but Ehrman has a lot of other great books that fill this void."
2,Too Much and Not Enough,"Unfortunately WW II Collectibles tries to cover it all but in eighty pages can only scratch the surface. This is not a book for serious collectors, maybe a introductory glimpse at the variety of items. Very limited detail on the depth of these items various models, date changes variations. Little is said about the vast flood of reproduction material out there especially for a book written in the 1990's. While it purports information on conservation of memorabilia little guidance is provided on storage preservation or display."
1,"Excellent season, few special features",This season not include Spanish subtitles like the season 1 and 2. This is bad to me and my friends from Mexico and Latinamerica.
5,Will and Grace seasons one and two,I have Will and Grace Season one and two. I think they are great. I am sure that season three will be also.
5,Best season,"This is THE best season of Will and Grace. I have the first five and this is always the first one I go to when I want to watch something that will make me laugh. If you only purchase one season of this show, this is the one."
5,Will & Grace - Season Three,This was a great way for me to watch one of my favorite shows over and over again.
4,"Great show, disastrous DVD presentation","NBC shows have been among the best in terms of packaging, menu design and navigation. But they sure did drop the ball on Season Three of Will & Grace.Seasons One & Two had very attractive, clean menus that matched the outer boxes. While Season Three's outer box follows suit with the first two, the menus are a complete disaster. They are overly animated and completely tasteless. Plus the episode selection now spans two pages -- an unecessary annoyance for choosing among only 6 episodes per disc.Season Three is a great season of this top-notch show, and is certainly a must-have for any TV-on-DVD collector. It's just too bad we'll have to be offended by these horrible menus each time we wish to watch an episode. Here's hoping NBC gets their senses back for the remaining seasons."
3,no consideration for people whose language is not english,"I think Will and Grace are one of the best series out there, we get to see it here in Mexico trough cable TV.We sometimes get sitcoms dobed on national TV but it sucks, and W&G; will never be broadcasted here because of the gay thematic of the show.So our hopes of getting a Region 4 DVD are out, so we turn to Region 1 and we get one of the best seasons of the show WITHOUT subtitles, the previous season had them, what happened?I do know english but i usually turned the captions on, on english cause some lines are said too quickly for someone who isnt used to hearing it everyday... whenever i didnt understand what was said the captions would aid me, but now there were lots f jokes i didnt quite understand, especially Karens since she is the one who talks more quickly and squeaky, its frustrating to hear the laughs and dont get what its been said.Hope next one has captions."
1,Item never arrived.,"I ordered this item a week before Thanksgiving and was given a week or so shipping date. It is now the day after Christmas and I haven't received a thing... This is one of my favorite shows and the prices for the week before Thanksgiving sale was too good to pass up. But, I guess that meant not receiving items."
2,Pretty Damaged,This product came fast but was pretty damaged compared to the other seasons of Will & Grace I ordered used.The front and back cover are ripped and disc 1 and 4 are significantly scratched.Disc 4 is completely scratched.
5,great!!!!!!!!,okay first of all. you have your opinions. abd others have their opinions. i mean seriously you people just dont have the same tastes as other people so dont give will and grace bad reviews. and if you worked on the will and grace dvd 3rd season boxed set oyu would probably like the menus and the cover. plus it dosnt hurt you to just push a couple extra remote buttons!
5,Awesome Season!,"This is quite possibly the best Will and Grace season ever! I would highly recommend it for someone considering just buying one season of Will & Grace (this is the one to own!). I would rate it higher than even season 1 and 2 because Karen and Jack really come into their own during this season. All the characters have developed their own unique tendencies and ""quirkiness"" in this season and the jokes are fast and furious! If you don't laugh hysterically during the 80's flashback episode, or the menage a trois, or Sandra Bernhardt's verbal assault, or all of them for that matter, well, then you just aren't human!Hopefully we'll see season 4 on DVD soon but this season will satisfy the Will & Grace fans for now as it will make you want to watch it repeatedly!"
3,After the S2 blunders...,"They better not mess up again, promise all sorts of extras and then not deliver!After buying season two and seeing what a bad joke that was, I may not even consider buying season three.And why should we pay money for sliced up copies of these episodes when that's what we're already getting in syndication?Get a clue, NBC!"
4,"Where are DVD sets for seasons 4, 5 & 6?","Will & Grace is my favorite show, and the only show I have liked for years. My copies of Seasons 1, 2 & 3 are wearing out from repeated viewing, and I've been waiting for Season 4 to be released.The first three seasons were each released 6 months apart, so I was expecting the same for the release of Season 4, but it still hasn't appeared.Although I agree on how the season 3 DVD set was botched with the annoying menus and lack of content, I hope this didn't discourage Lion's Gate to cancel future releases.C'mon, Lion's Gate, release the other seasons for the North American market. I'll buy them all."
4,The only bad thing is...,This box set does not have subtitles as the previous one...WHY???...Apart from that this is the best show EVER!!!
3,DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE for the next season !!,"Well, the series is still great BUT the dvd is so not good !! I'll give two reasons :1) NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES (as for french or spanish subtitles : let it go !!)2) The outter case is taller than the fisrt second seasond, it's a shame (this is not enormous but !).Only better thing, the menus are nicer than season 1 and 2 (even if they were very nice in those), more ""developed"".I just hope the subtitles (with the FRENCH please !!)......thanx..."
4,MUST HAVE!!!,"This is one of the funniest shows I've ever watched. I watch my collection of ""Will and Grace"" all the time. It never gets old and it's funny every time I see it. I recommend this to anyone who wants to laugh and laugh and have a wonderfully fun time. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM ALL."
3,sub titulos por favor!!!!!!!!!!!,"que sucedieron con los sub titulos en espanol?soy de habla hispana, y creo que como yo habran muchisimos mas que se preguntaran lo mismo. Tambien he visto que la 4ta. temporada se presenta del mismo modo, tendremos la suerte de que rectifiquen a partir de la 5ta. entrega?Deberian tener en cuenta que de seguir por la misma linea, dejaran de lado a un sector muy importante, los clientes de habla espanola."
1,Waste of money for non native English speaking people,"What a disappointment! The two first seasons had subtitles, which made the DVD understandable to people outside US/UK. This time - nope - no subtitles. NBC - you have just lost a customer.Regards from Norway"
4,Design Flaws but Still Love The Show,"Just found and purchased Season 3 and love it. However, I find the graphics on the root menu to be very annoying and a bit difficult to understand and maneuver. There really is no need for heavy graphics and floating circles just make it simple and easy to play the episodes. Looking forward to a simpler Season 4."
1,lower and lower value for the money...,"season 3 is great, price is good, but season 1 boxset had spanish audio+eng/spa subtitles while we got to season 3 without ANY subtitles, just english audio, NBC should consider these boxsets are bought by people all around the world, and W&G particularly NEEDS subtitles if you have not native fluency. It's unbelievable they released this thing (reason for my low rating)."
4,Loved by kindergarten class,"As a volunteer and not a teacher, I read this story to a kindergarten class in the Phoenix area of Arizona. I missed completely the point about self confidence as a discussion point, but the story was very, very well received by the children. They all enjoyed it even though they did not know what a fox was nor why it was exciting and scary that there was a fox in the henhouse. They also were not familiar with the verb ""crow"". Once the words were defined, they were quite engaged and I received applause at the end. My goal is to encourage a love of reading by reading out loud to the children. This book was an excellent choice for this age group."
2,Too many mistakes,"The technical content is ok, but I am extremely tired of reading books that contain so many grammatical mistakes that one gets irritated every time a page is turned. This publisher is notorious for this and emails I wrote to them were not answered. This is just not acceptable for an expensive book. Don't they have proofreaders?"
3,Useful but pricey,"I recommend this book but ... there are numerous (sometimes confusing) copy-editing errors and the things I'm most interested in (using ACID, using unified logs and using ACID with unified logs) are the most confusing. Given the length (500 pages) I'm surprised at certain ommisions and puzzled why 20 pages are wasted on a program listing (the book comes with a comprehensive CD with includes the book in pdf format)."
5,Read this book if you use Snort,"I have been running Snort on my company's network for a couple of years, and I rely on it heavily. I know my way around Snort pretty well, but this book still helped me with a lot of stuff that I did not know as well. The whole book is great, but in particular I thought the chapters on preporcessors and Barnyard were just awesome. I've never seen coverage like this on these two topics anywhere."
2,Good for the layman...,"Hmm, this book has some good info, but overall it just didn't delve into the kind of detail I was looking for.. essentially it was a big dissapointment. I think the other books I've read on SNORT have been much better than this. Not reccomended."
5,Love me some Jude Cole!,"I hadn't heard it in years, I had Start the Car and 3rd Street as cassettes back in the 80's and 90's. So I bought it as a CD recently. The first time I listened to ""Worlds Apart"" again, I just hung my head and the waves of melancholy just flooded over me. It brought back bittersweet memories, which all had such meaning, it's amazing how music can trigger such strong feelings and memories. And Jude Cole was indeed a soundtrack to a great time in my life, I had just moved to LA, and was in a relationship,and so high on living in California I could hardly stand it. I have not, and will not ever feel like that again. And it wouldn't have been what it was without the music of Jude Cole. How his music and lyrics didn't reach a much higher level of popularity I will never know, but, all the more for the rest of us who really cherish him!"
5,One of the 90's best CDs.,I think this CD is even better than A View from 3rd Street. All great songs with superb vocals.
5,Not a bad cut on the album,Gotta agree with most here. This is one fine album. Pop at its best. I've had this release for 10 years and play it regularly to this day. It seems to me that many of JCs fans use View as his benchmark and I have to say that I don't really see the connection to View although I am clearly in the minorty in not really liking View from 3rd St. I think this release along with I Don't Really Know Why I Act This Way is some of the best music to come out of the 90s.
3,"Great title track, the rest. doesn't measure up","Don't get me wrong, Jude is a great songwriter, and the music is good. But it doesn't ROCK like the title cut. So if you only heard the title track and liked it, don't take the chance. It is pretty soft the rest of the way through. I'll probably appreciate it more as I get older! Probably this very reason that the cd went out of print kinda quick?But good luck trying to get just the mp3 for Start The Car. You'll have to belong to one of the clubs and pay for it, it is nowhere to be found which explains why I bought the cd!!"
4,Good stuff!,This is a good CD. I got because one of the songs were used in a Hip-Hop sample nicely and had to know who sung the song. This kat can sing.
5,Great Romantic Comedy,"This is a great movie, good actors, story keeps you interested. Worth watching once or renting but not something to watch over and over."
4,cute,"very cute ""girly"" love story. Great cast, a little predictable but overall this has a nice storyline. I enjoyed this movie."
4,Not so bad,"I am typically not a fan of romantic comedies, but this one is not so bad. Although not a favorite movie, it is one I do not mind watching and will watch again."
1,"Far From Being in a League with Roman Holiday, Much Less a Classic.","Is this what we get for watching modern romantic comedies? 1 out of 9 are good, and that's stretching it. Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel? Never heard of them before this movie was temporarily overhyped. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck? No contest. I'm not even old enough to remember when the classic 50's film came out, and I'm too old to be fooled by the audacious stupidity and lack of charm this one cannot even begin to hide. Horrible premise, bad dialog, annoying coin cult stalkers--especially Jonathan Heder, stoner boy extraordinaire in ALL his appearances--and the one stupid cliche' joke all these movies seem to have. Normally it's a friggin' food fight or someone falling in water and screaming. These bozos went with the clown car bit. Horrible, predictable ending, and jokes that just fall flat. I was drinking, and I STILL didn't laugh. The only other movie I watched this past week that was worse was All About Steve. Ugh!"
2,When in a New York City Blackout...,"Everything will be blacked out, except where you happen to be at the time!Perhaps it was magic, perhaps it was dumb luck, but when lightning strikes New York (and there seem to be an awful lot of lightning references in this film), and puts the entire city on black-out ""standby"" our heroine discovers why from a lit apartment and by turning on her cable television.Then, while all of New York is stuck in darkness, her destination is well-lit, and the Elevators work too!Who wrote this dribble?My wife and I rented this because we thought it might be cute, funny, and a light diversion. Instead my wife said before I could open my mouth, that this was a movie beyond stupid.What a shame. Handled correctly with a few decent thoughts, it might have worked?"
2,Not a strong effort,"Kristen Bell is a workaholic who has not had time to find a man to settle down with, yet she desires companionship. While attending the wedding of her sister in Italy, she inadvertently casts a spell over several men, who are now in love with her. Despite a strong cast, this film lacks elements of charm, humor, and romance, all of which are absent in this weak effort."
1,THE MOST ANNOYING ACTRESS EVER,"I DID NOT SEE THIS MOVIE BUT EVERYTIME I GO TO THE MOVIE STOP THE TRAILER IS PLAYING. JUST THE SOUND OF HER GIVESME A HEADACHE. EVERYTIME IT PLAYS I WANT TO LEAVE THE STORE AND HAVE THE EMPLOYEES TELL ME ""IT IS SAFE TO COME BACK IN IT IS OVER/ just the scene where she yells to her denitists ""why don't you leave me alone i don't know you""and he says ""i am your dentists"" and she tries to be funny saying ""oh and i am flossing twice a day"" terrible, awful,whoever thought that awful scene in a trailer would make someone want to see such a bad movie. i am sorrybut just hearing this trailer makes me say this has got to be the worst movie ever. this girl cannot act and themovie but be painful to watch!"
1,Another lame RC,"Every romantic comedy this days is exactally the same garbage. They were never a very good style of movie. It's redundant, stupid, lame and now rehashed."
4,Pretty Funny!!!,"This movie was better than I expected, and was quite funny. Kristen Bell stars as a single art curator named Beth, who can't seem to find her true love. While attending her sister's wedding in Rome, she meets Nicholas Beamon, who is very sweet and very clumsy. When she sees him kissing another woman, who happens to be the groom's cousin; she gets drunk and steals coins from the fountain of love. (According to legend, if you take coins from the fountain, the owner of the coin will fall in love with whoever took the coin) When she gets back to New York, Lance a magician, Gale, Antonio, and Al follow her around and confess their love to her. In order for this to stop, she must return the coins to their owners, and see if Nicholas was the one who truly loved her. I highly recommend WHEN IN ROME!!!"
4,When in Rome,I saw this in the theatres and really enjoyed it so I just had to have it. Good feel good movie. Let's you escape the real world for a little while. Isn't that what a movie should do? Would definitely recommend.
4,when in rome,this movie is one of those that make want more so romantic specially when is film on the love capital rome
1,"Vapid characters, pointless plot","This movie is the furthest thing from cute or heart warming, it will only annoy you. And I enjoy the romantic comedy genre on occasion. Just avoid this one."
1,Wow.... That was horrible!,"I'm a big fan of Kristin Bell and Josh Duhamel, but WOW... this was a train wreck! They were both decent in the movie, but the plot and supporting cast were so over-the-top unbelievable and downright idiotic that even Kristin and Josh's best efforts couldn't have saved this flick from disaster. The movie lacked any flow and many scenes left me feeling embarrassed for everyone involved in the production of this stinkfest. If you're looking for a funny, romantic comedy (like I was), LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE. I read the bad reviews beforehand, but still decided to give it a shot. Ninety minutes later, I wished I had heeded everyone's strong warning. When a movie receives this many 1-Star reviews, you have to know something is up. Once again..... WOW. SO BAD."
1,I want 90 minutes of my life back,"Honestly, what has happened to people that they believe this film was worthy of anything more than two stars... on a good day.Stupid story. Atrocious screenplay. Totally predictable ending.And where the heck was Rome?I guess we'll just have to go to Italy ourselves.If you think that Hollywood hasn't put out a truly great romantic comedy in ages, go ahead and skip this one as well.Complete and utter waste of time."
1,No Chemistry,"I love Kristen Bell and Josh, however, this romantic comedy was ""slapstick"" style and the characters had no chemistry what so ever."
1,When in New York!!,"All those expecting to see a sweet romantic movie based in beautiful Italy (Rome in this case) will be highly dissapointed and I suggest you pick up the DVD of 'Only you' or the recent 'Letters to Juliet' instead. The stock shots of Rome and a few scenes in Rome last for maximum of 15 minutes. The rest of this ridiculous story takes place in New York. So we have Magic coins making people fall in love with total strangers, thunder, lightening, irritating supporting cast and a song and dance finale probably inspired by 'Slumdog Millionaire'.The acting, story and direction are below average.So why the one star..well that's for some truly beautiful shots of New York."
1,Don't bother,Poor dialogue. Momentum of the storyline decreased as the film went on. Poor character development (nothing made you care about any of them). Plot was slow and the comedic moments were not funny.
3,A cute rom-com worthy of a Saturday afternoon,"I really enjoyed this rom-com! the slapstick nature of the movie flirted with ridiculous, but somehow I was always forgiving and found most of the situations to be entertaining and charming. Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel deliver good performances and carry the movie quite well. A cute story!"
1,Lousy,"I was disappointed withWhen In Rome. I had hoped it would at least be a bit funny, but by and large it wasn't. The premise had some promise - for a romantic comedy - but comes across as at best boring. Some scenes, like the guys groping for Kristen Bell in a dark restaurant, come across more as perverted than funny. I don't think I laughed at all through the entire movie - it was that bad."
3,When in Rome DVD,"This is a sad waste of two very charming and talented actors. It was mildly amusing in spots, but on the whole, I found it disappointing. Of course the setting was beautiful, but it was less than memorable or I might have more to say."
1,Save yourself,This movie was beyond awful. It was so stupid and terrible and you should save yourself the time and the money and find something else to watch. The highlight was Dax Shepard repeatedly taking his shirt off but even that isn't enough to suggest you watch it.
4,This is lightweight (which is a good thing),A straight ahead RomCom with nice twists and a pleasant plot. Unchallenging but then some of the best in this genre are just that.
3,Cute movie,"This is an any time movie. This ""chick flick"" is one that you will want to watch again and again. Bonus, while the credits are running, continue to watch as the cast members dance together the whole time."
5,My wife's favorite movie,"My wife really loves this movie right now, and there is enough comedy to keep me entertained at the same time."
2,for junior high,I'm a Kristen Bell fan. She must choose better flics or her star will no longer be rising. [She does- with her husband whom she met in this movie....}
4,"Very cute, innocent intertainment.","Very cute movie that is enjoyable entertainment. If you are sick of movies that force toilet jokes or blatant sex humor, or coarse language down our throats then I think you'll like this one. I don't think there is one bad word in the whole thing. The two main characters were really likable. It's fun and a nice movie I just bought on Amazon after seeing it on pay-per-view. I smiled though the whole thing."
4,Not just for chicks,"This was much better that I expected. Sure the story line is kind of predictable, but there are so many funny and cute ways that it's presented. Josh Duhamel is quite good in this which I didn't expect. And, Kristin Bell isn't overly loud and full of herself. The movie has kind of an old fashioned feel to it - not overly sexy, not overly comedic. I can't quite call it a chick flick because I found my husband laughing at many of the scenes and I didn't have to worry too much about my teen watching it - no one jumping in bed or f'ing every other word."
3,;0),"It's not bad and it's not good it's in between it was mediocre.a woman attends her sisters wedding in Italy, was at the fountain and picked upna couple of coins doing so brought a curse that each coin from the guy who puts it there will fall in love now she as to weed out the one that actually loves her. Ok watch but still watchable."
4,"Very enjoyable, zany","The premise of this story is that while visiting Rome, the protagonist, a young female curator at a major U.S. museum, plucks several coins from a fountain of love. The fountain is magical, and each man who threw the coin in (originally) falls immediately in love with her.The movie was slapstick and laugh out loud funny. The suitors do some very hilarious actions to win over the protagonist. They each have a distinct characterisation that is cliched. For example, one of the suitors is a street magician, so he will always try to do crazy magic tricks to impress the protagonist. A lot of the comedy seems to come from the interactions of these crazed, cliched suitors with each other and the protagonist. Also in the middle of this storm of suitors, the protagonist still has to do her stressful museum work! I also found a cheesy and sweet love story for her with Josh Duhamel's character."
2,Disappointed,"Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel a darling couple and the scenes short in Rome plus the wedding beautiful but the secondary characters didn't match with the storyline. I almost turned it off but then watched it to the end.I purchased this because of the trailer but honestly, didn't enjoy it with the exception of how they met."
2,Could try harder,"I disagree with the reviewer that thinks that this film delivers exactly as it should. I understand that the rom com genre isn't supposed to make great intellectual statements and wow you with their original plots - which is what I often love about them, but this was just bad.I ended up fast forwarding through the last 45 mins as I didn't have the patience to watch.I like the two leads a lot and thought they did fine, but the film was a little like watching a play put on by over earnest drama students wanting to produce a quirky take on the rom com and I just didn't get caught up in it as I usually would with this genre.I am not a rom com snob (love some of the most cheesy movies going - 27 dresses anyone)? but this is just really badly done and I am shocked that they managed to drag so many talented people into one bad bad movie...don't waste your time and instead rent something cheesy but quality...this will just leave you bored and uninspired."
5,Good clean entertainment,Funny and full of whit and charm! A great movie that will keep you wanting more. One of family's favorite movies!
2,Boring,"It's not often that I watch a movie and half way through it, I have a horrible urge to turn it off because I have better things to do. This was one of those times. I'm sorry, but I just did not like this movie. I don't know if it was the pace, the acting, or the story that was flat, but it failed to impress me on all accounts."
2,CORNY,"Some ""Laugh Out Loud"" moments but overall VERY corny and disappointing. I'll never let my sister recommend a movie again ;)"
4,Love the cast!!!,They're both so hot and have amazing chemistry on screen. I saw this twice in the movie theater and now I wanna go to Rome so bad.
1,A Ruin,"I like chick flicks. I like rom-coms. The Holiday and Love, Actually are part of my life lexicon. I HATE this misbegotten waste of production dollars. No chemistry between the principals. Terrible script. No wit. No intelligence. Angelica, Danny and Peggy must have all had child or grandchild tuition payments looming, and their agents should be beaten with a stick for allowing them to do this (or, heaven forbid, urging them to do this.)This dvd is already at Goodwill waiting to poison someone else's world with its lackluster, irritating presence. Run! Save yourself! (And your $$$)"
2,"""When In Rome"" has many funny moments but the story is plain bad","Length:: 5:12 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie ""When In Rome"" directed by Mark Steven Johnson and starring Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel in a rom-com about taking coins from a fountain and attracting stalkers.[...]"
3,"Not That excited, I looked for","i think, it just gives the preview that where and when he lived his life, i expected more how he lived his life..not where and when..well..still it wasnt that bad."
5,Excellent,I absolutely love this CD! I've had been hearing the song Harbor Lights on a local radio station which played very frequently but could not figure out the album it was on. Finally contacted the station and was told it was 101 Strings. I then located it on Amazon and ordered it. I had it in my hand within DAYS to my amazement!! Thank you so much!
4,Don't study just one book!,"There are 250 questions in the exam. Since the authors are all CISSPs, they are not allowed to directly give away the questions. Each book offers a relative limited number of practice questions. When I was preparing for the exam I realized that I would need to practice with a large number of questions to be properly prepared. So, I decided to ignore all the comments here on which book was better. I bought and read several books to prepare for it. My logic was: if I read an additional book and it helped me to get just that one additional question that I might need to pass the exam it would worth the additional $500 that I would have to otherwise pay to take it again. I took the exam recently and passed! Looking back, this and the others all helped."
4,Excellent CISSP prep book,"Shon Harris has written an excellent CISSP prep book.My only complaint is that she sometimes venture into areas, which are pretty, much off topic.Other than that, a winner of a book."
4,The Bible of CISSP material,"Simply put this book is the Bible of CISSP study material, if you read this book and understand the material and can apply it you will be in great shape for the CISSP exam.Downside? The sheer size of this book can be intimidating"
3,Could be better ...,"The book was a fairly easy read, but lacked some crucial content. This was apparent when taking the actual exam. I encountered numerous questions that were not addressed in this book. Overall, this title could be used as a sole source, but I would recommend finding at least one more good reference to use. The included CD of sample questions was rather worthless."
5,Excellent - Simply Excellent,"This is, in my opinion, the best single source of study for the CISSP exam available today.Given the wide range of topics covered by the CISSP exam and it's 10 domains, writting a comprehensive book on the subject is difficult at best. Shon Harris manages the task better than anyone else has thus far been able to do.I highly recommend this book for anyone needing ""full disclosure"" of the 10 domains of the CISSP exam. It is detailed, it is accurate, and it is well enough written that it really does not have the feel of a reference book... though I also recommend this book for any current CISSP's who need a quick reference on the shelf to refresh their memory. It really is that good.(For the reviewer that compains about spelling, grammer, and inacuracies... I'm sorry, but I have to disagree. I've read the book from cover to cover. I saw very few errors in spelling or grammer. And the information is spot on accurate. Perhaps we read different books?)Keith Palmgren, CISSP"
2,can you say typo?,"this one is a poorly written book with lots of typos. Things that could have been easily caught by a spell/grammer checker. I ""cannot not"" believe that some one proof read this book and did not find something wrong with ""that0"" book. :-)The material is also confusing at times. I don't mean to be picky but I saw some recursive definitions. For one thing, headers could have been numbered and that would have solved a lot of confusion. And, oh a lot of grammatical mistakes.On the positive front, it does have web site references at the end of each section. That seems to be very useful.I would not recommend this edition of the book. Maybe, the next revision would be better."
5,Technical depth and great coverage,"The amount of information and the number of topics that ISC(2) has included in the CISSP exam is a bit overwhelming. I spent big bucks to go to their review class and still did not feel overly confident about my knowledge level for ALL the topics this exam covers. I was also not positive of exactly what I should zero in on.I have found this book quite helpful because it seems very difficult to find information on ALL the topics that ISC(2) has in their outline for the exam. Even searching on the Internet for hours there are some topics that I could not find any real useful data on. But it seems to be all here in this book.The amount of practice questions in each chapter and the CD has helped me ""zero in"" on the exact concepts I think I need for the exam.I think this is an excellent choice and recommend others to check it out!"
5,I did the CISSP exam and I can tell you this is the best!,"I bought the CISSP All in One book, as well as the CISSP Prep Guide (Krutz) and the Official ISC2Guide to sit for the CISSP Exam. I did my CISSP exam this year (2005) and I can tell you that this book, the All in One CISSP, is THE book. The chapters are so well written and so well explained that you do not need any other book for the exam. I was really surprised to read these difficult concepts so well explained and so clear, because it is no easy task to write in ""plain"" English all these concepts. If you buy this book, you definitely do not need other book, all what you need is here.I have read negative comments for this book. I really do not understand why there should be any negative comment. Anyway, think this way: for me, it's the best book, and I can tell you that if you do not consider it the best, at least it's among the best around. Trust me."
3,Could be better,"Well, how can I say? This is a good book, not a great one, but a good book. One thing that transforms a book that could be great on a OK book is the writing style. She is a feminist and she does not care to hide that during the book. Everything, except for the bad examples like hackers, thieves and so forth, is referenced on the feminine. This causes a anti natural reading and make you loose your focus on the reading, causing troubles on your studies. To me, she can spare us from this and focus on writing, instead of trying to push this feminist crap that drives the student nowhere."
5,Easy reading and comprehensive.,"An excellent book. Well written and easy to understand. It is the first book I've read that flows from topic to topic. The best part is there are no redundancies in the information. Over 900 pages of solid information with references. I've read other books that write the same thing over and over again just to fill the book with more pages. More than an exam guide, it provides comprehensive content of all 10 domains. I recommend this book to both security professionals and business executives. I'm impressed!"
1,What an embarassment,"The book is full of spelling errors, grammar mistakes, and incorrect information. The Practice Exam Software included with it is just as bad. It is definitely not worth the price, find another book to buy."
2,This is Junk,"Dont buy this book,I will be running out to buy the Krutz CISSP Exam Prep book ASAP!Let's just say that after the first three chapters Ms. Harris's book, it became real obvious that she felt more need trying to push her agendas. Most authors have the good judgement to stay neutral using his/hers he/shes.... NOT Shon. It is quit annoying.It get's two stars. One for her ability to cut and paste information that is freely available on the internet. The second because she uses some funny illustations."
5,"Sparkling good book, certainly worth buying!","With 11 years of experience in the field, in my opinion this guide is a top one. Harris has a clear -back to basics- style of writing which come along with some supporting drawings (most people intend to have visual learning capabilities) and fine examples and references.You'll need certainly some experience in the field and some kind of overview about security topics but with some other additional material available in the field like that of Roberta Bragg and Krutz you'll pretty satisfied with this guide.Rob Faber [MSCA, MCSE Server 2003]"
5,This book worked for me - passed first try,Excellant book. I passed the exam first try. I did study for 3 months though so it's not just a read the book and take the test.
3,"Good, but not comprehensive","There is some great content in this book and it definitely gives you an understanding of the basics in the 10 Domains. It, by no means, is enough to be able to pass the exam.After having taken the exam, you realize that you are recalling a great deal of information not included in this particular book.It is a good cornerstone to your study collection, but is not detailed enough.This book is also tougher reading than the CISSP Prep Guide, but I feel it helped more (having gone through both)."
1,All-in-one? Too much in one!,"I bought both this book and the CISSP Prep Guide. While neither can claim to be 100% comprehensive, CISSP All-in-One actually claims to be. It isn't, in fact, it's almost overkill in some senses. I'm busy, studying for this exam in whatever spare time I have. I much prefer the CISSP Prep Guide - it's very to the point and gives me just the right amount of questions, background on the domains and so on. I take the exam next month and feel very well prepared - but not from this book!"
5,Believe the Hype...,"This book lives up to the title, ""All-In-One"", by really being a great single source of study material for this hellish exam. I used it for about two weeks prior to exam, read a few chapters that I needed to brush up on, took tons of notes, and passed. Also, the author has a unique writing technique that makes the information flow nicely and makes it even interesting at times(Information Security can be really boring at times).The author is keen to target key items that are tested. Definitely study the items that are highlighted in grey boxes throughouth the book. Definitely take the practice exams, both at the end of the chapter and in the included CD. Couple this book with hands on experience in Information Security, Auditing, or Assurance and you're almost sure to pass."
3,"New ""CISSP Prep Guide Second Edition"" is better","I have several CISSP books, including this one and the just released ""CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the CISSP and ISSEP Exams"". While this is a good book, the new Krutz/Vines book has more information, is more up-to-date with better questions and a better value, with 1000+ pages @ $40. I can also use it for my ISSEP study when I get my CISSP. FYI: don't get the older ""Prep Guide"" variants, get the latest one."
3,NOT A GOOD EXAM PREP TOOL,"I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much fluff in here. I had already bought many of the recommended texts listed by ISC2. What I needed was focused preparation materials that took me through, approximately, what I could expect to find on the exam. What I got here was a rather poor rehash of the dozens of better written, classic, professional texts that have been written by others. I even found topics on the exam that were definitely NOT addressed by this book. Bigger is not always better."
3,Good CISSP reference.,"Good reference for CISSP. Easily comprehensible material.BTW, curious to know, has anybody taken CISSP exam, and not passed?"
3,"Good for General Knowledge, Bad for Exam","I read this book and almost memorized it. I found it to be way to detailed for the CISSP. The CISSP poses questions that are vague and open to interpretation. If you are studying to pass the CISSP, you should probably use the book published by ISC2 (located on their Web site.)"
2,"Good, contains errors, reads easily","This is a book I very much enjoyed reading.The content is not always correct or complete, but I guess that is a problem that is found in most ""all-in-one"" books.While reading this book I very often got distracted by the way the author got me involved in examples that take away the attention from the important information.The chapter about Cryptography is not complete.I do not believe it is possible to pass the CISSP exam with just this book.It is a pity that there is no motivation with the solutions for the test questions. The solutions sections consist of a list of letters. If a question is troubling, this approach doesn't help.Overall, this is a nice book. But it should not be the only reference you read on the subject."
4,Good Book for passing CISSP exam,"I found this book to be a center for my studies for the CISSP exam. Between the All-in-One Exam Guide, and ""The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the CISSP and ISSEP Exams, Second Edition"" I passed the exam.The All-in-One guide covered the 10 domains very well, and I found it easy to go through and understand the material. I found Shon Harris' explanation of certain concepts easier to understand than other books that I have read in the past. I had 5 weeks to prep for the test with this book as my primary study base - and passed the exam.Info about me: I have worked in almost every spectrum of IT in the past 8 years, with 5 years of that experience one security field or another. Anybody that meets the minimum requirements of (ISC)2 should be able to easily pass the exam with this book, as well as the one mentioned above."
5,Electric Performance of Tchaikovsky Serenade Opus 48,"This is beautiful music played with shimmering clarity by a highly talented youth orchestra. The tone of the strings is simply amazing under the deft direction of Paavo Berglund. I have many versions of this wonderful work, but I always turn to this CD as my very favorite. The Dvorak Serenade is extremely excellent also, making this CD doubly blessed.BIS always provides recordings with amazing fidelity and tonal depth, particularly with String Orchestras."
3,A bit on the thin side....,"I've got two other Brausch CD's, and this one is least useful of the three. Several topics covered here need to be fleshed out in more detail. There are other books on this subject done by other prominent marketers(I'm thinking of Dan Kennedy) which provide considerably more heft for the dollar.At points on this disc its implied that this is the first in a series. Hopefully the foundations laid here will receive fuller treatment then."
4,published in the '40s,"There is a great wealth of fine historical and technical information in this book. I bought it specifically because it mentioned, and in fact has a section on, Jerry Gebby, a gunsmith who first developed the .22-250 cartridge under the patent "".22 Varminter"" in the late 1930s. The author seems (pretty clearly!) to not like Mr. Gebby, yet carefully states his advancements to the genre.Here is the thing: This is a detailed history of varmint rifles UP TO THE MID 1940s! It was written in 1946!The book was quite expensive and, frankly, I really wanted more up to date information on Mr. Gebby's rifles, as I own one and am having trouble getting a clear appraisal.. Anyway, I am keeping the book as part of my collection as it, too, is an antique!"
2,Had high hopes,This video production does not do justice to O. Henry's great story. I hope someday to find one that does.
2,A waste of a good story,"I'm not sure what is worse, the acting, the screen writing or the mess they made of a great story. IT'S A BIG WASTE OF $16.00The story was completly ruinned the setting was to be a small flat in NY's village the appartment in this movie looked like a victorian place. Thsy dresses well and the entire feel was wrong including an added twist of a grandmother telling hea child the story with some stupid put on twang. The whole production was really a waste. I guess the producer paid for the awards it won.IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE A GREAT VERSION OF THIS BELOVED STORY BUY O'HENRY'S FULL HOUSE BY CIMINA CLASSICS I BOUGHT MINE ON AMAZON, IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE AND YOU GET 4 O'HENRY STORIES WITH A CAST OF GREAT OLD TIME MOVIE STARS. Just a wounderful collection of stories. I was so happy to find it, I lost a VCR copy I taped from TV years ago.It was never showen again.You won't go wrong."
5,classic,"This short film is a timeless portrayal of selfless love and compassion in the ""true"" spirit of the Christmas season. It should be in everyone's video, CD collection."
2,Confusion,The descriotion said it had George Wendt in it and he's nowhere to be found. Also the director listed was different. I already ahd this video and thought I was getting a different and hopefully better version of the story. I felt ripped off.
5,"great cheap tube, stock up","Great cheap tubes. Stock up on them from the internet and save.They are long lasting, fairly thick rubber, good valve, take patches well if you get thorn flats.Be sure and check your valve type when ordering. Schrader is the kind like a car has, and Presta is the little bitty European style with the lockring and valve exposed.If you use presta tubes, get the Inline shrader adapter in case you have to use a car inflator. They are brass and $1-2."
2,Not entirely satisfied - plays like a copy,"I ordered the DVD Vivah. The DVD arrived on time, but the quality is poor. The movie plays like it is a copy rather than an original of the movie."
3,"love the movie, hate the quality","I've seen this movie before, but when my sister ordered it for me she didn't realize it was made on demand, so basically its a copy. Very blurry and not a good quality film. Do yourself a favor and order an original from one of the vendors."
4,Will make you cry like Toy Story 3,"Vivah is stuffed with sincerity, warmth, and family values in a good way. It's the most mellow Hindi movie I've ever seen and still managed to make me ugly-cry for like 5 minutes. Why? The lead couple, Prem and Poonam, are supportive, respectful, and deeply in love. And when the big bad happens I felt enormous relief at the unconditional love. Hence, my stuffed nose. So, throw away your cynicism, which is always necessary with bollywood movies anyways, and prepare to be softened by this lovely little (2 hr 49min) movie. Also, Shahid Kapoor is criminally cute as always :)"
1,Not the Crimson Ian,I'm a huge fan of Ian Mcdonalds work with King Crimson and especially the Mcdonald/Giles album but this albumis pop drivel with no hint of prog. The drums alone destroy the album as they stick to power rock style with no integrity.Save your money and skip this one.
1,forgettable performances by all-star lineup,"The list of contributing musicians reads like a who's-who of classic rock. But the performances on this, McDonald's first solo disc are utterly forgettable. Talented singers such as John Wetton and Gary Brooker sound very uninspired and are too low in the mix. There isn't one great song hook to be found, and the music suffers from a minimal amount of (much needed)time changes. ""You are a Part of Me"" would pass as a Foreigner-type ballad if Lou Gramm were singing it. The instrumentals sound like bland versions of Alan Parsons Project styling. It's not a progressive album in any sense and the songs seem underdeveloped overall. The only halfway-decent tune is ""In Your Hands,"" but it alone is not worth the price of admission."
2,Bah.,"Los discos de los exmiembros de King Crimson, a excepción de Bruford son bastante insulsos. Este no es una excepción. Hay temas que suenan a Alan Parsons, temas que suenan a Asia, temas que suenan a Steely Dan, temas que suenan a Foreigner, etc. pero todo muy descafeinado y con poco interés. En fin, el típico disco con tufillo a AOR, para poner un par de veces en el coche."
1,could have used a producer,"metronomic & stiff. not from a founding member of king crimson (no matter what Peter $infield says). thankfully, its' not longer."
2,The Island of Missed Opportunities,"When compared to the horrific ""Island of Lost Souls"" (1933), this 1977 version of the H.G. Wells classic pales considerably. Good production values, but Don Taylor's direction lacks punch and Burt Lancaster is woefully miscast in the title role. Despite everyone's best intentions, ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" represents another failed remake."
3,What is the Law?,"After the 1933 horror Classic ""Island of Lost Souls"" starring Charles Laughton as Dr. Moreau & Bela Lugosi as Sayer of the Law yet another movie adaption of H.G. Wells (The War of the Worlds, The Time Machine, The Invisible Man"" twisted horror novel starring the legendary Burt Lancaster as the half human half animal beast creator, Dr. Moreau & Michael York as Andrew Braddock, the shipwrecked man who is in terror on the island & beautiful Barbara Carrera as Braddocks's love interest Maria, It's a thrill ride!"
4,Lancaster better than Brando,If you saw the Kilmer/Brando version I urge you to see this version. Burt Lancaster is excelent as Dr. Moreau and York does fine work as Prendick. This movie is more faithful and easier to follow. If you liked the original book by H.G.Wells than skip Brando and see this one instead. Youll be glad you did.
4,Nice pice of splicing!!,"Written in a time when gene splicing was only done with plants, and set in a day when it was barely done on plants, this oddity was awesome. A scientist who breaks all the rules to create his mutants on a lost little island. The scientist played by Burt Lancaster was a role made for him. He was controlled, fearless and very believeable. As with all good things, his empire crumvbles when the mutants see him breaking the LAW and all hell breaks loose. A great film written before it's time and reminiscent unfortunately of the Nazi scientist of old. Get this and the remake and sit back with the big screen and the sound system going and enjoy a set of horror/sci-fi hybrid movies for the generations!!!"
4,The Island Of Dr Moreau,"I saw this as a teen in the movie theater and enjoyed it then,many years later I watched it again,and although it didnt GRAB ME,like it did back then I still enjoyed it.A fun way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon."
4,The Island of Dr. Moreau,"Based on a novel by H.G. Wells, the greatest sci-fi writer ever. You won't see those types of stunts w/animals anymore. A true ""classick"" for anyone w/a penchant for the bizarre."
2,Use in the Classroom,"I teach 9th grade English, and after reading Wells's ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" in my English I class, I chose to have my students watch the 1996 remake rather than this version. Although both movies greatly deviate from Wells's story, the 1977 version would have bored my students to tears. If you intend to show a movie version of this novel, then I would choose the 1996 version since it is faster-paced and more dramatic. Plus, Val Kilmer plays a very convincing Montgomery. The redeeming quality of this 1977 version is the cave scene during which the Beast People teach Braddock ""The Law,"" though your students will probably be asleep by the time that scene occurs."
1,Crocodile,"It is the older version of Crocodile. Set in China or Asia.The picture was boring, because you could not see the movie plainly. It was too dark. Daytime looked like almost night all the way through the movie. If it wasn't such a waste of money I would toss it in the garbage. Just like Day of The animals. My friend has one of these. And you can see it just fine. Wish I could return both of them."
3,Disappointing....................,"The Maiden in the Tower falls into eight short scenes. The orchestral interlude between the first two scenes brings us the real Sibelius, and the second scene is undoubtedly impressive; there are echoes of Wagner, such as we find in some of the great orchestral songs of the following decade. All the same, it lacks something we find in all his most characteristic music: quite simply, a sense of mastery. Yet there are telling performances here from Mari-Anne Haggander and Jorma Hynninen and the Gothenburg orchestra. Neeme Jarvi's account of the Karelia Suite is certainly original, with its Intermezzo, too broad to make an effective contrast with the ensuing Ballade."
4,Coffee Table Book,"A plethora of information adorned with absolutely gorgeous pictures. The only real downside is the massive size of this tome--it's a bit ungainly to sit & read unless you have a lot of table space. Otherwise, a solid piece of work."
2,Didn't last long,"Well, we're talking about a dog in the top 10 of the intelligence list (Blue Heeler).I tried to untie the knot. NO WAY! The dog did it in less than two hours and completely shreded it. I had to throw it away so the dog wouldn't eat the shredded strings.No more of these or me."
3,Are you kidding?,"I recently paid about $80 for this item and was not impressed with the product I received. I purchased the 10"" version of the T-600 from Target for $20 and was more impressed with with the item. I would only recommend it to someone that collects these items and doesn't plan on displaying it. As far as the detail, the manufacture detailed the item very well. However, the hands and fingers are very fragile and could break off. I displayed the product with my other robots and transformers; I suppose that I will keep it."
5,Waiting for an encore!,"I can't add anything to what's already been said, but now that several years have past since the release of this CD, I'm sure itching for a new release from the 7. They are very skilled musicians and this album showcases their work and ability in a way that Late Night can't. It's very catchy, keeps my foot tapping, and keeps me awake on those long road trips. A must have for any Conan fan, but VERY good in its own right."
3,"Good, but not the best.","The narrative is a bit confused, and the jump in ages between this book and the previous ones in the series--one wants to know what happened in between!--is a problem, but it is still worth reading.To answer the reader who objected to Meg's putting her scientific career 'on hold' to be a wife and mother, L'Engle herself said that she did this because (a) there were a lot of children's and young adult books coming out at the time which had strong female characters choosing a career, but that (b) feminism was supposed to be about CHOICE, and she wanted to portray a strong female who CHOSE wifehood/motherhood as her vocation, as opposed to on the one hand who chose a professional career or on the other hand fell into the wife/mother role by default."
1,anonymous,I have never read any of these books but im always up for something new to read. The summary i read makes me confident that ill like them. I hope there as good as a lot of people say they are.
3,A little trippy,"A Swiftly Tilting Planet by Madeleine L'Engle is another in the Time Quintet series. It was written third, but is fourth in the series.Fast forward through Meg's high school and college years. She is now married to Calvin and expecting her first child. Sandy and Dennys are finishing college and Charles Wallace is 15. L'Engle's style is still and interesting mix of Science Fiction and fantasy though I thought this book was a bit more ""trippy"" than the first two.Once again the fate of our world and possibly the whole universe is at stake. Instead of traveling to other worlds and interacting with imaginative creatures, there is more time travelling and altering.I'm curious to see what happens to this family in the next installment."
4,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,"The book arrived quickly and in great shape. The only issue I had was I was under the impression that it would be a hard back book, but it was a paper back. It was a gift for a person who prefers hard back books, so that was a little disappointing. Otherwise I was happy with they purchase."
5,Never too old for this book,"I first read L'Engle's books when I was 10 years old and this is clearly the finest work. Ever since that first reading, I have picked up the book once a year to revisit Meg and Charles Wallace -- you could say that I'm pretty familliar with ""Planet"", as I'm 25 years of age! Whenever I enumerate my top reads, ""A Swiftly Tilting Planet"" is always on the list, nestled between Shakesperian plays and Greek tragedies. Odd? No, ""Planet"" is epic."
5,I loved it!,This was one of my favorite books. It was very exciting and fun to read it was hard to put down.
5,One of my favourite childhood books,"I first came across Madeleine L'Engle when I was in the fifth grade, and I have been reading her books ever since (that's eleven years!) A Swiftly tilting Planet is the most mature of the Murray Trilogy, but I also think it is one of Madeleine L'Engle's most spiritual novels. The message, and the plot, is timeless."
3,Disappointed,"Although the plot is good, I agree with some readers that I'm very disappointed. Meg has a lot of faults, which is what made her seem more real, down-to-earth, than Charles. I was hoping for more devolopment on Meg's part. Instead, she becomes a house-wife that can do very little. I'm very, very disappionted."
2,disappointing,"After having read A Wrinkle in Time and The Wind in the Door with my son, we looked forward to the third book in the series because we had enjoyed the other two so much. However, although Madeliene L'Engle's writing is wonderful, the story just didn't hold our attention, and we abandoned it about a third of the way through. I was plodding through it for my son's sake, but I finally asked him if he was enjoying it, and he said he wasn't either. In the end, neither of us much cared how--or whether--Charles Wallace was able to stop Mad Dog Branzillo from blowing up the planet, mainly because Charles Wallace as himself was so little involved in the action of the story (and Meg and the rest of the family were only peripherally involved as well). We were mainly being introduced to characters whose importance may have been revealed if we had finished the book, but it was confusing to an eight-year-old and not terribly interesting to his mom."
3,This Planet is Making Me Dizzy!,"At the beginning of this book, it may be boring. And confusing if you having read atleast the first one. (A Wrinkle in Time) Overall, its a pretty good book. But the first book is the best. Theres like, too much dialogue in the beginning. But in the end, thats when you get sucked in as if you were really there. I suggest anyone who loves adventure and drama to read this book, and I also suggest you read the first one first."
2,I did not really like the book.,This book is to confusing for a 10-12 year old or anyone older for that matter. The WHEN is constantly changing and there are over 20 characters. Things like Might-Have-Beens or Projections are to confusing.
4,The Eternal Triangle,"The Owl ServiceA similar theme is seen in the Alan Garner new classic The Owl Service.With global warming hanging over a tilted planet , this story seemsto still have a current bite: with an element of Celtic legend mixed with popular magicit gives a very entertaining result. I liked the original""A Wrinkle in Time"". In this series of books the Sidhe arereborn as benevolent aliens and fayness becomes an high I.Q.with telepathic traits.Magic and familiars become""Christian"" in a strange peace loving way.Blue eyed Indians which are the paleoanthropology dreammake a new American history with a Welsh folk tale of recurring archetypes.Can past and future both be changed for the better ,if we know the consequences of failure?Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela"
2,This book surprised me...,"I am an avid fan of Madeleine L'Engle and have read nearly all of her fiction. This book, however, did not grab me at all. I didn't find myself particularly worrying about whether or not Charles Wallace managed to save the world from the crazed dictator. Some parts were interesting, to be sure, for I think it's absolutely impossible for L'Engle to offer a bad book. However, her other books were far superior, in my opinion."
2,Just too weird,"I read the first two books, and they were very weird, but I still liked them all right and would have given them 3-4 stars. This one was just TOO weird. I completely didn't understand parts of it and abandoned it about halfway through. Very challenging and not highly recommended."
1,...,"Oy! How could someone call this a children's book? It doesn't deserve the one star I'm giving it! The plot was too complex and the characters were hard to follow. I had to read this book for school and I dreaded reading it each day. i nearly through a party when I finished it. Unless you are a deep reader, don't read this book."
4,Dark and disturbing,"I last read this book as a young girl and was surprised at how dark and disturbing the story was. Although the theme eventually turns out to be redemption, the twists and turns the story takes set ""A Swiftly Tilting Planet"" far apart from ""A Wrinkle In Time"" and ""A Wind In The Door"" in terms of seriousness of subject matter. I probably won't let my children read this until they are at least as old as Charles Wallace is in the book. Speaking of age, it was strange to see Charles Wallace as a young man instead of as a sweet, precocious little boy. Overall, however, a good and unforgettable book."
5,This is a really good book!,"I loved this book! It could be the best book I have ever read! It has a well written plot, and is mixed up, which I like in a book. You won't understand this book until the very last page, and I had to reread parts of it again. I throughly reccommend this book!"
2,Organizational Behavior,Another book that was required for UMUC Tech Management degree. I don't rememnber anything in particular about this book or the class.
4,realistic tale,"Vision of the hunter is a good book. On the cover it's compared to the books Jean M Auel writes. And it's true it's a lot like Clan of the Cave Bear: a child from another tribe is taken in, although they don't really know what to do with him. The rest of the story is different: where Ayla was raised as one of there own, Finn is not wanted by anyone, grows up with the scraps they give him.But it's a realistic story. I'm an archaelologist, so I've got the right background to judge it, though I'm nog a prehistoric archaeologist. The story was believable and gripping, I wanted to finnish it in one go !"
3,Just because it's in print ...,doesn't mean it's so. Buyer beware. Be very careful of psychics and so-called psychics.
2,hard to start is putting it mildly,"will the person who wrote and said once you got the trick of starting, please post the trick. I've never been able to pull the cord on mine. it's REALLY difficult. Keeps us all wore out before the grass gets done. and then we don't use it. it won't start. :( Too high priced for the difficulties in it. Needs an electric start."
1,carberater trouble,i purchased a trimmer after about 1 hr. running it faild to run at all I returned to the srore. they gave me another one. now tiis new one will onley run if you leave choke partly open what is wrong. Ive owned RYOBI products for years this is the first trouble I had lik this
3,Good...but........,"I personally liked his project ""Connected"" better than this one ....I am a loyal fan of Jay-J. #1,#5,#7,#8 tracks are more appealing to those of us (in my circle...bougie,ethnic,rhythm lockers....)who incorporate the beat and the message of the songs to multiple feelings.I like his house/inspirational style....almost like a house head undergoing transcendental consciousness, Living in San Fran or NY.*****Jay-J.....The Connected Album was the BOMB, it ranks high with the likes of Tony Humphries or Dimitri from Paris!*******"
3,So So Music,"Flamenco it's not. Salsa it's not...It's not bad, but there are better artists in this category. Strunz and Farah, Johannes Linstead, Tonino something-or-another..."
2,"Not Salsa, nor Flamenco","It's interesting how guitarists are throwing the term Flamenco around these days. Now they are throwing the term Salsa around too. This is a Latin ""flavored"" album, but it is neither flamenco nor salsa. Other guitarist that capture this genre with more flair are artists like Strunz and Farah, Johannes Linstead, and the relatively unknown Eric Hansen. I would have rated this album a little higher if it were not for the misleading title."
3,it's OK,"Texas is a nice band.I'm not a big fan but I think songs like Summer Son,Say What You Want,Inner Smile,In Demand,In Our Lifetime are cool.Other than these songs,I dont think the other songs are that good."
5,Full of life and vibrancy,"Texas is a band full of life and vibrancy.What makes the band so special is petite Sharleen Spiteri's incredible and beautiful voice with that wonderful lazy sensuality which I could listen to for hours , but that is not to say that Texas doesn't have fantastic music and lyrics too!These are indeed great hits.My personal favourites are `In Demmand', ` Say What You Want' , `Summer Sun' , `Black Eyed Boy' , `So Called Friend', `Halo' , `Guitar Song' , `Prayer For You' , and `When We Are Together'This is perhaps the best album of 2000I wish I could give it ten stars"
2,What was I thinking????,"I heard a song on the radio and it was by Texas. After that, I went and bought this CD. What was I thinking? This is pure pop music crap. Now, if you are a fan of pop music, this just might be the CD for you. On the other hand, I cannot even find the song which prompted me to think I would like this group and I do not want to ever hear them again. So, anybody want to buy a CD, real cheap? As it turns out, the song I wanted, ""You Have To Live A Little"" is on Rick's Road and is NOT even on Texas' Greatest Hits (an oxymoron, in my opinion)."
5,Good Place Tubegin,"Tubin's symphonies often seem noisy and bombastic, but you can't say that about the lovely 4th, probably the most enjoyable of the lot. The 9th is worth hearing as well. These excellent performances are the place to start in approaching this Estonian composer."
5,Listening for God - A Book to be Read,"I highly recommend this book to Christians at any point in their spiritual journey. It is insightful and clear in the tangible actions an individual can take to replenish or begin their prayer life. Marilyn Hontz writes with a warm and inviting style, as though she was sitting next to you, having a conversation."
5,Excellent book on prayer,"This book is a treasure trove of wonderful insights and suggestions for deepening prayer. I highly recommend it, and have even purchased it as a gift for my friends who also want to go deeper in their relationship with God."
3,Very Very good but poor sound,"After many years looking for Blues at Twilight, appeared on a very good LP called ""The Blues in the Modern Jazz"", I bought this CD. But I get dissapointed because the poor engineering sound work on transfer this title from LP to CD. As a collector i didn't get angry enough but I miss that LP sound.Anyway, this Cd has two sessions recorded in 1957.here are some additional information:Arranged by Quincy Jones and featuring Cannonball Adderley, Horace Silver, Percy Heath, Art Blakey, and Connie Kay. (See also John Lewis and The Modern Jazz Quartet in this section.)"
3,Great album - disappointing sound quality,"I owned this wonderful album for many years and the sound on the LP was excellent. However the remastering onto CD is really poor.I have always felt this was Milt Jackson's best album, his playing is as good as it ever was, and solos by Lucky Thompson and Canbnonball Adderley also excellent.This is one that should be taken off the shelves and remastered."
4,Nice product for home use.,It is just perfect for home karaoke. All you need is a descent home audio system and you are good to go.we use online karaoke service. Purchase cordless mic to avoid the hassle.Nice product again.
3,Behringer Minimix Karaoke mixer,"I bought this when I was visiting USA. Unfortunately Amazon site did not give options for the power supply usable in other countries. So, I ended up with a 110V power supply. Although I really liked the features of this Karaoke mixer, I am not able to use this yet. Hope Amazon can ship a 220V power supply for this unit."
4,It worked but kind of weak,"The mixer worked with my setup for casual KARAOKE and party. it is built with plastic and feel find of weak that could broke any time. However, the function wides, it supported the simple features with no problem."
4,Better than I expected,"I was hoping just for something that had some voice effects at least. The little mixer I was using did not produce great volume and I thought it was a factor of the microphone. This little karaoke mixer is clear and produces good quality effects especially at this price. I tried the voice cancel feature on a song. It works okay, cutting out instruments as well, but I did not expect magic. If you really want to sing a song but don't have a karaoke version it at least gives you the option. While there are other features that would be useful (optical audio passthrough or ability to fine tune the voice cancel) I would not want to be forced to pay more. For the price you can't really go wrong!"
2,DISAPPOINTED BY THE PERFORMANCE,IT HAS BEEN POORLY DESIGNED BY A RENOWNED MANUFACTURER BEHRINGER.EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY PRODUCT. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY. IT IS NOT AS PER THE SPEC.IT IS A GREAT SURPRISE FOR BEHRINGER PRODUCT USER.
2,NOT A KARAOKE!!!,"Ordered this ""karaoke"" machine for my 8 & 10 yr old granddaughters, who are great little singers! But WHOA this is only a mixer and not karaoke at all. Thankfully their mom is an electronic wizard and could figure how to hook it up, but there is no place to put in a cd, therefore no words to follow. I am so disappointed!!! Alas Amazon...the manufacturer has mislabled this machine."
1,"Mix Machine, I say Fix this piece of crab!","I have bought other Behringer products similar to this one and they work fine for the price but the minimix karaoke machine is a low quality equipment and it doesnt deliver for the price. maybe if it wasnt that expensive but its not worth the money... but be my guest and try it, youll be karaokeing sad songs in no time...jajajajaja!1!!!"
1,"CHEAP, but really not reliable","bought two of them, both of them got problem,first one, can only use 1 mic, 2nd mic is always very hard to work well.2nd mix800, only one channel works, the other channel got no sound. dont know why.I thought it was my software or laptop's problem, but it is not, knew this after many test with other machines.find a good one, guys!"
4,Cancel the voices!,"This item was purchased to be used in performances where the sheet music and/or accompanist was not available. It was rather complicated to figure out and doesn't work on all cd's, but was useful."
1,Compact Karaoke Outfit,"My son opened on Christmas morning only to find that the microphone did not plug into the karaoke machine so there was no way to use it. Now I (the Mom) have to find a mic that will plug into the machine. This was my son's main gift, and it was a bust."
5,a risque regency with a twist...,"as an avid regency reader, I'm always on the lookout for new regencies with a twist or the unexpected. Seducing Mr. Heywood certainly fits that bill. Unlike most regencies-where the man is the rake,notorious and experienced-in this regency the lady-thrice married and quite a beau monde scandal maker-is the much more experienced of the two. I loved the fact that the hero is a bit younger, fresh faced and never married VICAR!The book is well written and fast paced-the author was able to turn, what at first glace,a very unlikable heroine into a wonderful character by novels end. The author fits many funny and interesting characters into this short,fun and flirty novel. This book is quite sexy by most regency standards-while not explicit-you'll find yourself rooting for both characters-that they find their love-and make love as well:)I thoughly enjoyed this fresh new look at regency romance!5 stars:)"
4,Boney takes on Europe,"In 1795, Napoleon Bonaparte is making his presence felt all across Europe and this is affecting all the members of the Morland family. James has reluctantly agreed to an arranged marriage with the daughter of a wealthy businessman, feeling that, since he and Heloise are unable to marry, he may as well do his duty by the family and provide an heir to inherit the Morland property. This is book 11 in the series and is just as fascinating as the others. It's a very easy way to absorb history and I've learned more about English and American history from this series of books than from any text book. Now onwards to number 12."
4,Firewire Cable,"PROS:-simple to useCONS:-cable thick and not very pliableWould I BUY IT AGAIN:-yes, but only if it were <$5"
1,laugh-out-loud-funny,"Larry Drake(Overnight Delivery, Dark Man) plays a son of a man who inhearits his habits..which is killing people...he stalks Holly Marie Combs(Tv's Charmed) and her friends and kills them off one by one..giggling his way threw the murders. terrible acting and bad killings make this one washout..also starring Doug E. Doug(That Darn Cat, Eight Legged Freaks), Ricahrd Brooks(The Substitute and Wes Craven's Shocker), Cliff DeYoung(Suicide Kings and The Substitute) and the deceased but still everso great Glenn Quinn(Tv's Angel, Tv's Roseanne, Live Nude Girls, Shout, and Campfire Tales) Quinn pasted away tradgicly last year, he was one of the good ones I tell ya"
5,A Giggling Good Slasher!!!!,You have to love Dr. Giggles. If nothing else it is unique and the Dr. himself is great. This is a horror movie that you can laugh at. So the plot is a little thing but the acting is pretty good and the kill methods are really different for any horror movie. Grreeaatt!!!!!
2,Silly,"This is what you would call a ""cheesy"" horror movie, which I usually like, but for some reason this one just didn't do it for me.The titular character is a demented doctor who, following his escape from an insane asylum, goes around town killing people with medical instruments. Before each kill, he utters a corny medical-themed line such as ""Time to take your medicine"". There is one scene, set in the hall of mirrors at a carnival, that is particularly effective, as the bad guy and a couple of the characters chase each other around inside. I guess what turned me off was too many bad jokes, way too much unrealism, and one or two too many ""he's dead- oh, wait, he's not"" moments.If you like cheesy slasher type movies with bad humor, you may find this to be just what the doctor ordered (sorry)."
2,DR. GIGGLES,"WELL I WOULD HAVE TO SAY AFTER WAITING SO LONG FOR IT TO BE RELEASED ON DVD, I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED!!!! THIS WAS A FAV. FOR ME WHEN I WAS A KID. I LAUGHED THE WHOLE MOVIE, IT IS SO CHEESY NOW. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO GOOD HORROR BLOOD KILLING MOVIES????"
3,Dr. Giggles,"This is a movie about an insane doctor, who lives in a small town. After witnessing his fathers grueling death, Dr.Giggles escapes from a mental institution to reek havoc on the town where his crazed father was murdered. It is an okay movie that will make you want to watch it again and again."
2,Incorrect aspect ratio,The video quality is good but in my honest opinion it looks like it's the Goodtimes DVD cropped from 2.35:1 to 1.33:1 to 1.85:1. The box clearly states scopes on the box but it's standard flat. Another thing that irritated me was they changed the Universal logo and completely removed the Largo logo.
4,The Doctor Is In...Sane!,"Larry Drake, the menace from ""Darkman"" is even more menacing as ""Dr. Giggles."" He is insane and really cuts up his victims. A real slice and dicer not for the squimish. Now has sort of a cult following, I would like to see a sequel. Fellow L.A. Law cast member Corbin Bernsen also was a mad doctor in those ""Dentist"" movies.Some great theills and chills, and lottsa laffs!!! Have plenty of cola and popcorn, sit back and relax. The doctor will see you now..."
3,So bad it's good!,This movie does lack when it comes to good acting. But something has hooked my friend and I on it. We know that we can always pick up this movie for a good laugh and some fun.
5,Slasher with Lot's of Camp Appeal,"Dr Giggles is an example of a campy cliché filled Slasher that works.Due to the fact that it doesn't take it's self too seriously.The various ways he kills his victims and the instruments he uses is fun and entertaining in itself.A prime example of the rebirth of the Slasher in the 90's.Larry Drake is wonderful as the creepily humorous Dr Giggles and Holly Marie Combs is good as the heroine .This movie does what it sets out to do it gives us some campy laughs and some good old school slasher action.The scene where ""Dr Giggles"" as a boy reveals his hiding place after his fathers death ispretty intense and about the most serious and disturbing scene in the movie..But all in all a fun and campy Slasher flick."
1,"AVOID THIS JOKE OF A MOVIE,ITS OOP FOR A GOOD REASON","Avoid the new teeny booper filth(Dr Giggles,Scream,I Know What You Did..,Ghost Ship,Valentine,Urban Legend,and too many more to name)but stick to Classic Horror Movies(1978/Halloween, 1984/A Nightmare On Elm Street, 1984/Silent Night,Deadly Night(92min Uncut Version), 1981/The Burning(Uncut by Dragon not Vipco), 1977/Dawn Of The Dead and remember the new can't imitate the classics. PS DR. GIGGLES IS AS TERRIBLE AS LEPRECHAUN,PUPPET MASTER,CHILDS PLAY AND OTHER GOOFY BAD MOVIES THAT DON'T DESERVE TO BE NAMED HORROR MOVIES."
1,I think you all should be shot!,"This movie, Dr. Giggles, is the worst movie ever! It makes Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas look like the Godfather. It makes Glitter look like Citizen Kane. It makes Gigli look like Gone with the Wind. This movie will make you barf on your lap. Don't rent it. For christ's sake, don't buy it espessially from Amazon where it costs a minimum of 115 dollars. All of you who gave this a 5 star rating, i think you all should be shot!!! Crappy crapity crap."
1,Are You Stupid?,"Viewed: 3/12Rate: 23/12: I remember seeing Dr. Giggles back then, and it wasn't a pleasant experience. As a matter of fact, seeing the odious Larry Drake is never a pleasant experience. The film is as moronic as it gets. If you think about it, the incident happened in the 50's, and it has to make identification of lost children very easy to make. The constant, lame, and cliched one-liners by the charlatan wear off fast over time, making the film a tedious chore to sit through. All in all, Dr. Giggles...uh, forget it."
1,Larry Drake looks evil but can't act,how are we supposed to take a gimp from LA Law seriously?it'd probably help to bill your victims and get the payment before killing them. he's the greatest dentist of our time! Isaac yankem DDS has nothing on dr giggles larry drake!the geniuses in hollywood probably kicked themselves thinking they hired a prized gem from darkman to play this leading role.
1,Wow! This movie really SUCKED!,"I hated this movie and everyone in it. The lines that made it a horror comedy were lame and pointless. The one-liners were awful and the acting was horrendous. Also, the make-up effects made me want to gag. Ew! Yuck! Don't See it. Okay Bye."
4,WORD! to the previous reviewer,You sellers are making it hard for Po' folks to afford a good movie...I collect hard to find horror movie on DVD and will pay a pretty penny but sheesh...almost $50+???....I'll wait till Ifind it in a bargain bin somewhere.........other than that the movie is pretty ok.
3,jesus!!!!!!!!!!!,i collect dvds and came across this one and was shocked to see that it was more than fifty dollars! it is not worth more than twenty and want to let customers know that before they spend a chunk out of there paycheck to purchase this Dvd. the movie itself is not to bad but in noway worth close to fifty dollars.i would wait till you find it in one of thoses 5.00 dollar bins which will happen soon. i am!
4,"Great actress, horrible movie","I am a HUGE fan of Holly Marie Combs and all of her work, but this is just a terrible movie. It's full of fake blood and a really unapealing plot, but on the other hand, it's also full of Holly! The only reason why I rented this DVD from the video store was because she was in it and I didn't shut it off is disgust after the first five minutes for the same reason. I would reccomend this film to any Holly Marie Combs fan as she has some great scenes and proves to us once again what a fabulous actress she is. However, if you're looking for a good movie, forget about it.p.s. the four stars that i gave this are only toward Holly's performance. the actual movie would rate on my scale a one."
3,eh more freaky than scary,dr giggles isnt want i expected. it was a little bit of a let down but all in all it was still worth watching.
4,Dr. Giggles,"When I was younger, I remember seeing this movie when it came out on video. It was me, my stepsister, and her friend. And we sat in the dark as we watched it. We were totally into it. I recommend this movie, especially if your into the the ones that have comedy in them such as this film. I personally wouldn't rate this as the best horror movie, but it's a good one. So check it out!"
5,Dog loves this toy,I read online that you should only buy 100-percent cotton rope toy since it's digestible in your dog swallows a small bit so I was glad I could find this on Amazon. It's white so it gets dirty quickly but you can just throw it in the washing machine.
4,mom's favorite,"got this set for my mother two years ago when she was 91. she had it copied for all her friends and relatives. she was so disappointed when one of the cds got lost, so I re-ordered the whole set for her as a surprise. She called me, very excited. she's very happy and plays it regularly ""in the morning when I want to pray and remember."""
1,Does not last,"I purchased one of these for my turtle tank about a year ago. It quit working after about 3 months. Pump just died and nothing would revive it. I was very busy at the time and dug out an old, (5 years old) Aqua Clear fish filter. I used this filter until things calmed down, then purchased another of these, I figured the first was a fluke since Tetra is reputable company. It is now 3 months later and the new filter has quit. As soon as I post this review I am going to purchase a new Aqua Clear fish filter for my turtle."
1,Worst thing ever,"I bought this filter, and I had it for 2 days and it broke! So I returned it and got another one and after one night it started making a rumbling noise then it stopped working!Worst filter EVER!"
2,Not good for larger tanks.,"I got two of these (maybe it was the larger version) for my turtle tank. First of all the suction cups just pull right out of the back. That's really annoying. So, half the time my turtles mess with filter in the night and I find it in the morning floating in the middle of the tank. Ugh.Second, the water goes from this happy waterfall noise to this annoying sound like the pouring of curdled milk in just about four days. I don't know what causes that, but I clean my filters regularly. This is still annoying, though. I'm in the market for filters to replace these.They would be good for entry level or perhaps very small tanks, but not for something bigger."
4,good quality and gets it done,"i am using it for 20 galon tank, it's trying it's best but i think i should upgrade to a larger filter,my tank depth in more than this filter is designed for,"
4,So far it's great!,"It's been 3 days that I've use this filter, It won't clean the turtle waste from far away but it sure does keep the water clean :) This filter is quite, strong and cheap! So far, I feel like this was best 17 bucks I spent."
5,yay clean water,"Works like a charm with our dirty turtles. Keeps the tank clean for a longer period. I would wash this filter every other week and it keeps my tank cleaned for months. More water the better it works, the ""sticky"" cups that hold it up dont really do their job bc of the weight but we put it on a rock and it works fine."
1,Very Dissappointed,"I read the reviews and thought this filter would work out great for my 10 gallon tank with two small RES. It looked and sounded beautiful for about 4 days but now, approximately 8 days after setting it up, the tank smells horrible and is worse off than when I didn't even have a filter in there. The water is cloudy and despite the tank being only 3/4 full and in a huge open room, it's stinking up the whole downstairs!I don't know if I want to deal with sending this back but there is no way this is going to cut it for use in a classroom. No learning will take place with this thing splashing stinking water around.There has to be something better out there. Especially for a little ol' 10 gallon tank!"
1,I HAVE TO CLEAN IT!,"I have bought two of these, the first worked well until my baby turtle actually started to poop! Crazy concept, huh? I got frustrated and all I could afford was another one of these filter systems. I got really upset when I had to clean my whole tank and my filter weekly; my turtle is only 8 months old in 4 inches of water! I is supposed to work for up to 20 gallons but his water is constantly dirty and there is only 5 gallons in the tank. I have tried putting Turtle Clean in which helped some but ultimately the filter clogs too often and other times it does not pick up any thing at all. I was highly disappointed."
3,Incomplete Fixx,"Warning shot....the versions of ""Stand Or Fall"" and ""Red Skies"" are inferior live versions. This collection also does not include any tracks from albums after ""Walkabout.""The ""Ultimate Collection"" has the studio versions from ""Shuttered Room"" and songs from 3 more albums, and is the better buy."
3,The Millenium Collection - Great audio quality,"It appears this is a record company release not necessarily a band authorized project. I would recommend the Ultimate Collection for a more complete hits album. The audio quality on this is outstanding, however, and it is a must have for the serious fan like me. One review complains of the album art, which is not the pics I would have used if I were the artist. The liner notes imply the band not to be very active which I can attest is just the opposite. The Fixx is touring currently to packed venues and have a lineup in place for 2001 as well. In the end it is a good thing to have The Fixx's music out and selling as they deserve much more credit artistically than they sometimes get being lumped in with the 80's has-beens."
2,There are better Fixx compilations out there...,"...and this is not one of them! It's not bad if you only want the hits, but if your favorite songs are from the first album, then you're a little out of luck. ""Stand Or Fall"" and ""Red Skies"" are both live versions. This record is exactly the same as their 10 year old ""Greatest Hits"" record, except that the song ""A Letter To Both Sides"" has been replaced with ""How Much Is Enough."" (The sound is much better, though.) If you want a thorough representation of this band, pick up the ""Ultimate Collection"" that came out last year instead. It includes ALL of their hits, including ""Driven Out,"" which is not on the Millennium Collection. However, if the only song you know is ""One Thing Leads To Another,"" then this one should do just fine, I guess. By the way - why in the world did they put the same picture on the cover of this CD that they used for the ""Ultimate Collection""? Certainly there are many more photos of this band out there. Proceed with caution..."
4,Good photos but descriptions often contain errors.,"While the photography is excellent, and the author offers several interesting insights into symbolism and customs, the facts about particular monuments are incorrect. He gives the wrong locations for several monuments (placing them in cemeteries across town), and the descriptions of the cemeteries themselves contain errors"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I've ordered numerous books on Victorians and this one is by far the worst. The photos have a washed out look to them. Colors look faded and if you've ever seen a Victorian painted correctly, the colors are vivid and plentiful. Electric lines that ran between the Victorian and the photographer, printed out thick and dark black. Needless to say it decreased the beauty of the home.Number of pages totals 80 and the majority of them are photos but this book isn't nearly as good as Elizabeth Pomada's other books. It will remain in my home library because I've already paid for it but I can't say it gives me much pleasure to turn it's pages."
5,Painted Ladies San Francisco Resplendent Victorians,"As usual, anything I order from Amazon.com arrives in time and in perfect condition. This book is beautiful and I ordered it for a Christmas present for a friend, since I already have a copy. It was the perfect gift."
5,Excellent analysis of the Signs of the Zodiac,"I was very impressed by the depth of information this book provided. At times I felt almost overwhelmed because I thought there couldn't possibly be anymore to the mythology of this sign, and sure enough, there was! An unqualified yes to get this book for anyone seriously interested in Astrology, Mythology, or even Wholistic Psychology."
5,Brilliant -- has the ring of truth - 6 stars ******,"Burt has done a masterful job writing about astrology from a mythical and Jungian perspective. She truly understands the signs of the zodiac and the issues they represent in our lives. Her comments on the natal sun progressing during the life cycle are especially illuminating. To my mind, this book is one of the classic texts of modern astrology. I return to it repeatedly for fresh insights about the celesial craft. It is, hands down, the most influential astrology text I have read in the past decade. Burt's volume ranks with Bob Hand's ""Planets in Transit"" as a treasured astrological resource. It deserves 6 stars."
5,Excellent!!,What a great story about growing up in the coal fields of Southwestern Pennsylvania. Characters were engaging in this well written autobiography.
1,"DON'T TAKE IT WITH YOU,","There are good maps of the subway system in all Metro stations, this map is so big unfolded that it's very inconvenient. You might use it at home to get familiar with what's what, but it's not useful when you're actually on the subway system. better to buy a Good Guide book like Dorling Kindersley Travel Guides: Madrid, it has a metro map in it, and lists subway stops for major tourist sites. Subway maps are available online. Download a nice 8x11 map that will fit in your pocket. Free. Or ask for one at the first Metro station you get on."
2,"Outdated 1999 info, including Metro map",Unfortunately I did not look over this product for some time after rcvg it. Turns out that the metro map and points-of-interest info were done in 1999. The points-of-interest info may/may not be current--no way of knowing without crosschecking other guides. Should have returned product to Amazon.com.
1,Very Disappointed,I purchased this as a suprise for my mother and boy is she ever going to be suprised .The tulips were suppose to multi-colored and showed yellow and dark pink in the picture .The ones we recieved were cream and pink .yuck!Not only that! their stems were broken and mushy I had to cut a large portion of the stems away to make them stand up .Needless to say I will not go this way again .I will Purchase with a local flower shop from now on. That will save me alot on shipping anyway .I paid just as much for shipping as I did for the broken flowers which would have worth it had they not been BROKEN!I assumed they would have put some sort of coolant in the box but they didn't.If I could give any advice save yourself some money
1,"Poor quality, Do not buy.",This item is nice on the outside but is cheap polyester lining on the inside. I had it for one day and the lining started to pull where the plastic support meets the fabric. Both doors have the polyester lining tearing apart. Do not buy this because it will not last.
3,Mushroom Cat House,"Cute, decently put togeher but top heavy and the cap sags down so the animal has a hard time getting in the hole. Needs some sort of frame inside."
5,Thank You Amazon.com!!!!!!!!,"I am a big Beatles fan and I have been looking for the George Harrison ""Live in Japan"" CD for two years and could not find it anywhere, Amazon.com had it.My wife ordered me the CD for my birthday and I received it within 3 days, It came in a padded envelope and the CD was brand new still in the wrapper like it came from a music store. I really like Amazon.com and their service, I am very happy with my birthday gift from my wife Diane (Thank you Diane, I Love you).Thank you Amazon.com and Robert Dunbar, If it wasn't for you... I would not have found the CD.By Ed Kundrot"
2,Not Even Close To The concert For Bangla Desh !,"The eight George Harrison songs, played by an all-star band, that are featured on 1971's ""Concert For Bangla-Desh"" album are nothing short of amazing. Sadly this is not the case here. There are certainly some moments that might warrant a return listening, but after editing out the poorer moments here, you'd be left with very little of merit anywhere near the level of the former live work. The main problem here seems to be Eric Clapton's very bland, & corporate sounding, backing band. Harrison is able to lift them above themselves on a couple of songs, but for the most part they collectively weigh down any momentum generated around them. I've got a copy of this that I should sell at a resaonable price...this may be out of print, and hard to find, but if you've never heard it...don't get your hopes up looking at the great set list...and if you don't already own it, get the amazing ""Concert For Bangla-Desh"" first !"
2,Dissapointing transfer to SACD,This is one of my favorite albums. It had been out of print until this new release. I bought it again because of the upgrade and the transfer to SACD. I prefer my old version to this one. I do not think the transfer to SACD had any improvement. To me it sounds like all I am getting is the reverberation of the concert hall.I guess I was hoping for sound as spectacular as the Concert for George.
4,A must for collectors,"George Harrison after the Beatles broke up only toured twice.The first time was 1973 when he lost his voice about midway through the tour. The other time is captured on this CD.George uses Eric Claptons' band. Clapton has an excellant entourage of musicians.George plays his best songs and greatest hits not only from his solo days but also from his Beatles days.Harrison seems comfortable with Eric Clapton and they exchange some very nice lead guitar during the set.My favorite songs on the album tend to be the songs from his Beatles days.If I Needed Someone, I Want to Tell You, Here Comes the Sun, Something, Taxman and others.I have been a lifelong Beatles fan and like a sponge try to collect Beatles albums.George Harrison after the Beatles broke up in my mind wrote the best songs of all the former Beatles, with the exception of possibly John Lennon.This is a real treat for Beatles fans, and a very historical tour of one of the icons of the 60's and Rock music in general."
5,Live in Japan,"This is one Awesome CD,I heard parts of it, on-line and saw a couple videos on u-tube.I only wish we could buy it as a DVD that would be really nice to own.George and Eric sound really fantastic.It is a great Cd, I really love these 2 guys, they are my two favorite guitarists.Actually George Harrison is my favorite, but he liked Eric enough to have him on a Beatles record.And he is excellent also, but George has more ways that he plays the guitar that I love to listen too.Anyone who enjoys either one of these guitarists, will really like this CD."
3,Poor sound quality,I was very disappointed with the sound quality as it was very thin. I have many SACDs and this one has got to be one of the poorest in sound quality that I personally have come across. Fortunately I got it for $10 at Best Buy on introductory offer.
2,Necessary?,"Eh... I must disagree with Mr. Freund and Yitzak, I found the work so-so. Personally, I abhor any historical work which does not have the word ""survey"" anywhere in it's cover. If Dr. Hanson had included a lot more pictures, or, ""challenge questions"" at the end of each chapter I would have found it more entertaining. Whatever happened to books with pictures and ""challenge questions"" at the end of each chapter?A.B."
1,Clever but immature,"This book is clever and well-written and thoroughly researched. In this sense it is a solid academic book. But it is superficial and immature, delighting in self-reference and merely reading Nietzsche against Nietzshe ('if everything is untrue is this claim also untrue?') without recognizing Nietzsche's response to this sort of thing. Rather than trying to show that he betters his subject matter, the author would have done well to consider, as any number of Continental philosophers have already done, how Nietzshce and Nietzscheans have responded to this criticism, and thus why Nietzsche is not playing a game at all."
3,Don Williams - Anthology,"Great tracks! Of all the Don Williams CD's I have, this would be THE one I'd suggest for an all-in-one collection. Williams' mellow, gentlemanly tone is soothing to my country ears. The downside....once again here is a Don Williams CD without one of my favorites...""Yellow Moon"". Have all the labels forgotten that fantastic tune? I'd sure like to know of any CD with that hit. I only have it on the old LP with that title track. This is why I've limited my rating."
5,One of the best.,This was one of the best CD's I've ever bought. It didn't have one song on it I didn't like. I never knew that Don Williams had so many good songs. Truly a favorite of mine.
5,everything's here,"Don Williams has always been one of my favorite artists. This 2-disc collection contains everything I could want from him, with songs like ""Good Ol' Boys Like Me,"" ""Nobody But You,"" and ""Listen to the Radio."" You could listen to this for hours-even days-and never grow tired of it. Williams is one of the great artists of all time, and any fan of his needs this album."
5,Great Show,I saw the Storytellers show on tv. I enjoy learning about the story's behind the songs. Bruce is an great song writer. This is a must have for any Springsteen fan.
2,"More music, less talk.","I didn't see the VH1 show, or I might have been more prepared for what I was buying. Saw the duration of the dvd and figured the listed songs must be extended versions.So I put in the dvd and sat back, planning to enjoy an evening of great music. But then Bruce began to talk...and talk...and then he talked some more. Yes, he talked about the songs and the story they told. He talked about his philosphy of life that was inherent in those songs and the stories they told. Had I not been expecting and looking forward to hearing him sing songs, perhaps I would have been more interested in his outlook on life. But frankly if I want philosophy I don't go to Bruce Springsteen. I go to Tom Cruise."
5,Very good ground beef substitute!,"We are not vegetarians . . . but we are trying to ""cut back"" on red meats, etc.We think Vege-burger tastes best in recipes calling for lotsa' spices, as in Tacos, or Chili - we had some VERY good dinners from these = Dad also made a casserole, but the spices were lacking and the taste was less than stellar, but okay. He promises to try harder.Overall, we are most happy with this product."
5,Quality spanning a half century,I've been eating VegeBurger since I was a small child and my mother made delectable tamales with this product - the original and still the best. I learned healthy eating could be yummy. The torch has been passed and I still turn to Vege-Burger when I make traditional family recipes.
1,Veg Burger,"This has dextrose in it, which I can not eat. I don't know why they did not publish the ingredients on Amazon, so I could have figured this out before wasting the money. It was donated."
5,Loma Linda is great,AS a vegetarian for 37 years i think Loma Linda makes the best tasting products ever. They are cheaper than the bookstores or grocery stores and you get free shipping too.
5,Great price for a great product.,I have been using this product for most of my life. My mom used it and so do most of my four sons. It was terrific to get such a great price and NO shipping cost also.
1,I Have to Balnce These Reviews!,"I gave this a one-star for balance. Had the other reviews been balanced, I would have given it 2 stars.If you are used to eating meat, this stuff is a very big disappointment. When we mix it 1-4 with beef, people won't eat the mixture!My dog eats almost anything, but she won't eat this.Neither my wife or I will eat this, even when mixed with hamburger helpers or whatever.So, beware, because all these five-star ratings are from people who do not eat meat, and probably have forgotten what it tastes like."
4,Still sounds good,First bought this on cassette over twenty years ago and was a little worried it might have dated but I was so pleased that it hadn't. Terry Reid was one of the unsung heroes of British music of the late 60s and but for a commitment to tour the US of A with Cream would have fronted the newly formed Led Zeppelin. He recommended Robert Plant when he couldn't take the job and the rest is history. Still performing today with a voice that remains strong. Perhaps one day he'll get the acclaim he so richly deserves.
4,Terry Reid Fans (& More) ... You Need This CD,"I originally bought this CD because I was born on the 5th of Julyand one of the songs is called The 5th Of July and I sure am glad I did. I knew of Terry through my early days of buying the LP Bang Bang You're Terry Reid. This CD Rocks, I took a chance on it and You Should Too.PJ Severino, Trenton, NJ"
4,AOR/West Coast Music,"I really like this cd. Terry is a good vocalist & he pours his heart & soul into his music. I would file this into the West Coast/AOR music category. I like Fifth Of July, Drive Pt. 2 & the Gimme Some Lovin' cover. If you listen to Drive Pt. 2 it is the same music as ""Last Note Of Freedom"" by David Coverdale on the Days Of Thunder Soundtrack. I picked the cd up cheap. If you are an AOR/West Coast/Lite AOR fan pick up this cd, it is really good."
3,more for ethnic skin types,I've been using this product for about 2 months and I can see a slight difference in my complexion and skin texture. I'm also using Proactiv with it so maybe the combination is what's working for me.
1,It did nothing,"This product did not do anything for my skin, except make it greasy. I didn't like how heavy it was or what it did to my skin. :("
1,Stormy,Stormy is a book about a boy who finds a stray dog and keeps him. This dog was known for having rabbis and hurting people but since Allan found him he suddenly became nice. The book didn't seem so realistic. The author Jim Kjelgaard had a good idea but he could have made a boy and a stray dog go through different but better adventures. The author brought a dog into this book and the title of this book is named after the dog. The dog didn't do anything or make a difference in this book. That is my opinion of Stormy.
2,Get a real TV on the Radio CD,"Staring at the Sun is a really good song. I'm not going to debate that. It is, however, available on at least two other CD's of theirs that I've seen.GET ONE OF THEM INSTEAD!The other two songs on this CD are so strange that you can't listen to them earnestly. You can go ahead and preview them, but I can tell you that what you hear in the preview might as well be the entire song. Don't trick yourself. They don't go anywhere, they don't pick up, what you hear is all there is."
2,Stripped gears after 2 years,"It did an OK job of trimming but I did grow tired of replacing the line. Replacing the line isn't extremely difficult but it is time consuming. I switched to an aftermarket cutting head (big mistake) which had 3 plastic blades. Even with the blades I never used it to cut anything heavy, only for very light use. After about a year with the blades the cutting head decided to quit spinning. After taking it apart the cause of the problem were 2 gears that stripped in the cutting head portion of the trimmer. I wouldn't recommend this trimmer except for extremely light use."
1,can't get the string to load and feed out,"Have used Ryobi for many years and loved everything, but this thing is for the pits. I'm up in years and and can't get the string to load as a dual line. Then it would't feed out the other one I had was a breeze but this one is not right for the older people. I had a 725r before and this one is a 765r. Do you have anyone that could send me a picture on how to load this with string. I love your products but this one is flauwed. This one is harder to start also, I worn out after I finally get it started."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I am a student, of sorts, of Native American History. I stumbled upon this book by accident, and was intriged by the story summary. I was not disappointed. The author spun a tale with rich characters, history, drama and a heartwrenching ending that kept me reading till the wee hours. I also thought his Native American characters were respectfully depicted. That is very important to me. I look forward to other books by this author. If this is his usual caliber of writing, I have found a new favorite."
3,Where are the rabbits tales?,"I personally loved Watership Down so that is naturally why I picked up this book. However, it was disappointingly less new storyline than I expected. In fact the first half of the book was just the rabbits telling more adventures of El Ahrairah. Now this was not boring, yet I expected another great adventure or at least a series of adventures about Fiver, Hazel, and the others. I still recommend it to those who truly liked the first book, but do not expect the same rush that you got from the first book."
3,PLEASANT SEQUEL,"Since I loved the book Watership Down, I was overjoyed to find that there was a sequel to it. While not as good as the first book, I would definatley recommend it to anyone. The rabbit characters are more well thought out then most, and I wish that there were more sequels in store."
4,"Pretty good, but he's written better...","Now, this is a *good* book, but _Watership Down_ and _The Plague Dogs_ are *excellent* books, and this one is a /little/ disappointing by comparison. I think the other reviews describe it's faults and qualities pretty well, so I'll just say it's definately worth reading, (especially if you enjoyed _Watership_) but don't expect it to be better than (or as good as) the original."
5,"There should be a 1,000,000,000,000 star for this book!!!!!!","This is not much of a sequel to Watership down, but is the best book ever written!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved the tales and got great pictures in my mind.(!!!!!!!!...) Anyone who says this book is bad is a complete idiot. DAMN IDIOT!-- Will Age 9"
2,"I was sadly dissapointed by ""Tales...""","I loved Watership Down, I still love Watership Down, I will probably always love Watership Down. For years I wanted more and back in 1981 I got more - The Rabbits Ghost Story, published in a collection of Richard Adams' Favourite Animal Stories. I was surprised and elated to find that had been incorporated into this new book. However, when compared to the incomparable Watership Down this book left me cold. It had its moments but a female chief rabbit was not one of them. Nor was finding out that Bigwig was probably not the father of Hyzenthlay's kittens. I felt the format of eleven El-ahrairah stories on the trot was a mistake as was the overt attempts at political correctness. Well, at least nothing can dim the spirit of the original book. Watership Down was a product of its time (it was written in the late sixties) and it seems that in our time the rabbits of Watership Down have changed..."
4,A Good Sequel,"I studied the original, called ""Watership Down"" in middle school and then have read this sequel years later. It is a good sequel, however, it isn't as ""great"" as the original. It is still entertaining though."
3,It was okay...too short,"I enjoyed the stories about El-ahrairah, but those stories got in the way of the Watership rabbit's lives.The last part was just too short and hardly focused on my favorite characters. I finished the book in less than a week, and I don't read that much!Either way, it was ok and it was interesting reading the stories mentioned in the first book."
4,tales from watership down,"Tales from watership down,one of my favorite books.This is my favorite book because the characters are funny.At the beginning Dandilion tells a story.One part that was funny was when they said I do not know what a bunny is, let me sniff you over. These are reasons why you should read this book."
2,huh?,"I remeber trying to read this as a kid, and completly giving up. Recently I have been reading and re-reading all the books in my library. I never read Watership Down, and maybe that's why I had such a hard time reading this one. I found the stories completly unconnected, some of the charechters not at all well developed, and the plots horrible. For example, just at the right moment in one quest, when the rabbit was ready to dispair, a bird comes hopping along and gives the rabbit the answer. Then the bird dissapears, only to reappear later and do the same thing! I was happy when I finally finished the book."
2,Disapointing. But worth a read.,"Okay, it's nothing close to the origional. This is a collection of short storys about El-ahrairah, Rabscuttle, Hazel and the rest of the Watership Down crew. For the most part the storys are unintresting, unimaginative, and pointless. The book spoils the image of El-ahrairah, and makes him look like a clown. There are a couple of good storys though, I especilly like the one concerning Campion. But don't expect the quality of story telling evident in the origional."
4,Not as good as the first one,"The first part of the book--the stories about El-ahrairah--was pretty good, but in the part about Hazel and the other rabbits on Watership Down it seemed like the commentary was a little too obvious, less subtle than in Watership Down. So, it was worth reading, but I doubt I will reread it as many times."
3,Stick with the original,"This sequel to Richard Adams's masterpiece ""Watership Down"" is a very different book than the original and suffers by comparison. It is divided into three sections; tales of the rabbit folk-hero El Ahrairah, other rabbit folktales, and the story of what happened to Hazel and crew after the first novel. The folktales have a certain charm, but the part I was really looking forward to, the continuing adventures of the Watership rabbits, was distinctly underwhelming. It is prosaic and disjointed, full of small comings and goings that don't really amount to much. The mysticism in these stories is far more pronounced but to no clear purpose. If Adams is going to return to this wonderful world he created so many years after the original was published, he really should have more of a story to tell."
2,"OK, but nowhere near Watership Down in plot and suspense","This book was so-so, and I think the main reason I was disappointed with it was simply the fact that I read it after reading Watership Down. Watership Down is amazing; great character development and a plot which had me on the edge of my seat near the end! I was so enthralled with the book I put 'Tales' on my Christmas list last year. Well, 'Tales' is set up in three separate parts, and you don't even really get any type of follow-up to Watership until the third part of the book, and for me it just didn't have anywhere near the oomph that the original story did. Fans of the El-Ahrairah fables told in the first book should be pleased since more new fables make up a good chunk of 'Tales'. However, if you were left breathless after Bigwig's breakout of Efrafa with the does in the original Watership and you're hoping for more exciting adventures, you may be somewhat let down like I was."
2,Not what I expected,"The last part of the book where the story of Watership Down (which I've read about 8 times and loved) I enjoyed. I got bored with the El-ahrairah stories, probably because I never developed a sympathy for his character."
1,I guess Mr. Adams had a mortgage payment due.,"What an awful, shallow, boring money grad. Tales from Watership Down is a pale ghost of the original book. On its own, it is a bad read; next to the original Watership Down, it is a steaming pile of garbage.Secret Underground River. Are you kidding me?"
1,Disappointment,"I loved ""Watership Down"" and found this to be a disappointment and slightly waste of time."
1,BAD,"THIS IS ABSOLUTLY AUFUL! NOTHING MAKES SENSE IN THIS BOOK! I DON'T SEE WHY THIS BOOK WAS EVEN ALLOWED TO BE PRINTED! IT IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ! AND I'VE READ LOTS OF BOOKS! THIS ONE IS REALLY AWFUL! HORRIBLE! WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! IT IS TORTURE ALL THE WAY THROUGH!"
1,Ewwww!,"This book is awful. I mean awful. Do you remember the feeling, ""taste"" is your mouth, when you finished Watership Down? As soon as you get into Tales, that taste slides down your throat, leaving something horrible in its place.El-ahrairah suddenly becomes very silly. Each of the stories is bland, with no feeling in the writing. Even the stories about Hazel make you think that Adams is just out to please eveybody. And failing.Good job Mr. Adams! You have just made yourself a ton of money with a worthless book!"
3,Only for the fans,"The first time I picked up a copy of the book, it felt so good to a huge fan of Watership Down, until I started reading it. Found so many inconsistencies in the way the rabbits behaved that differ from their innate behavior in the first book. Otherwise, the stories and exploits into the life of El-ahrairah are adventurous and funny. The title of the book is suitably named for the entire book almost all consists of stories and rabbit ""tales"". If you're hoping that this might be a direct continuation or a sequel in itself to Watership Down, you might sore be disappointed."
3,Good movie.,"The thing I found interesting about this true story was how all three of Frankie Lymon's wives were different in their own way. Like Elizabeth Waters (played by Vivica Fox) was like a ghetto tough girl from the streets, Zola Taylor (played by Halle Berry) was like a glamorous singer, and Emira Eagle (played by Lela Rochon) was like a goody two shoes, well-educated school teacher."
5,I thought all the actors were great !,"I enjoyed seeing Larenz Tate as Frankie Lymon because I love biographies and I especially LOVE music. I saw "" Why Do Fools Fall In Love"" four times the first week thatit came out. I just couldn't get enough. All the characters seemed real and very believable. I bought the VHS video as soon as it went on sale. -Janet"
4,Love this song...,"Not that great of acting, but the quality of the movie (bellisimo). Plus I love hearing that song over and over again. :)"
4,Fools in Love-Great Acting,"Didn't know much about Frankie, except that he was a bigamist. The acting is great! It is worth having in your library."
4,Why Do Fools Fall in Love?,I have had this movie for a long time..It's got music from the 50's and 60's..My mother loves it..This is the tragic story of Franky Liman who could have had a great career if drugs had not entered his life...Franky had three wives who are in court trying to prove that they are the real wife of Liman..This movie has alot of flashbacks..funny in some parts..Cameo by Little Richard..
2,THEY PLAYED MY BABY DADDY,"This movie is a true story but they had the wrong actor playin this movie. Larenz Tate looks no way near Frankie Lymon. No more singing roles for him, It just did'nt seem right him playin that part.THe Woman's roles were weak also."
1,should have read the reviews,"One of the worst movies I've ever watched, I grew up in that era, we didn't use that kind of language for on thing, very poor dialogue, and it wasn't called Do Wop, it was Rock and Roll, or Rhythm and Blues, I wanted to see the whole story of his life, not just about his sex life, I would never watch it again, threw it in the trash, the best place for it."
4,Wings are heavy and big.,"Bought these quite a few months ago for LARPing. They are so big! The wing span is at least 4ft tip to tip. I bent the top support rod so they looked like they were partially closed so I could get through doors. The shoulder straps are great, but since the wings are a bit heavy, they dig into my arm pits. I recommend a long sleeve shirt or a non-babydoll sleeve shirt with these. Also, if you don't like the smell of latex, these aren't for you. Thank goodness they fold in half for storage. Overall, they make my character and they're durable as heck. I would absolutely recommend them."
2,I miss The Mix.,"When I bought this record, I thought it would be the follow-up to the CD by The Mix, it's not. It starts and ends with a few hits and is pretty clueless in between. The Mix has closed its doors recently and the music scene in Miami Beach is not the same for it. The good news is that I heard from the horse's mouth that they are re-opening in Miami downtown and may even go to New York too, and that early next year finally the new CD will come out. Until then I'll listen to the old one, because David's CD just doesn't cut it."
4,Let's Dance Swing,"I thought this video was easy to follow but my husband had a bit more difficulty following all the steps and had a hard time picking up the beat in the music. Sometimes they added some ""flourishes"" that may be a little confusing for the beginner. With practice, I think this video will help us to add to our current steps."
3,Decent Instructional,"After watching several horrible swing dance instructional videos, I was very happy to see this one was decent. The instructor was clear and even went tru some detail like lean forward to keep from looking stiff, with out overwhelming the student. I wish parts would have been shot looking at their backs. Overall a decent instructional."
3,boring,"the humor is really corny and if you are anything more than a casual learner, you will get bored fast, plus, the footwork isnt very clear. its like, if you want to feel like you are learning, but will end up not really knowing what you are doing."
1,Where are the feet,I didnt like this dvd at all. The instructors are boring and dont look like they are having any fun and half the time you cant even see thier feet ???? Very poor
2,Disappointed,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She tried to tune it and as soon as she did one of the strings broke. It was definately not as we had expected so we returned it.
1,Disappointed in the quality,"I'd heard a lot of good things about Freud tools, but having bought a couple of their bits, I have to say I'm very disappointed.I bought this bit a couple months ago, but didn't have the need for it until yesterday. The first piece of wood across this bit snapped the carbide tip off one of the cutters! So now I have a worthless tool...it's very unbalanced, so there's no way I can run it at high speeds in my router, and since I waited so long after purchase to try and use it, Amazon won't let me return it.[Not this product, but I bought another Freud bit at the same time as this one, and it broke after about an hour's total usage. I doubt I'll ever buy another Freud bit.]"
3,Christian Comedy,"If you have seen the Holla! Vol 1 DVD (not Holla, The Family Hour DVD), you will be familiar with The Gospel All-Stars too. You will be familiar with the same simular comedy routine with a few variations. However, if this is your first time seeing and listening to these artists, you may very well enjoy it tremendously. Had this been my first time, I believe I would have enjoyed it more. I admit I liked the Holla! Vol 1 DVD better. I also missed seeing Small frie in the All Stars.On a personal level, I did not care for the name All-Stars, it lacks the more personal, humble and unique place that Christian Entertainment should be. T.J McGee is one of the most talented Christian Comedians I have seen, and although he uses a lot of the same material he did in Holla! Vol 1, that purposeful but comedic nature is still coming forth.This is a video I would not mind showing to friends who come to visit."
1,Unfunny comedy,"My family and I may have laughed twice during the whole viewing. It was one of those dvds that I thought ""I have to have"" when I saw it at Target. I bought it and gave it away as soon as it ended. Unfunny!"
1,Item not as described!!,"Contrary to what the description says you do not get a Quadra-cut bit, you get the regular 2 blade bit. I called the company and they sent me another bit and it was the same 2 blade bit. I called them again and they told me that they had called Freud and that Freud had told them that the Quadra-cut bit only has two blades. So I emailed Freud and told them what I had been told and they said that noone at Freud had told them any such thing. I had to go elsewhere to get a Quadra-cut bit. If you order this bit you will not get a Quadra-cut!!!!"
5,Great,Best costume I hAve ordered. It s very well made. The mast is adorable. My son loved it. It was a hit all around. I would df recommend it.
5,excellent product,"I purchased this for my SUV for an 8 hour trip at Xmas. The extra space was wonderful. We traveled in 6 degree weather and the bag did not split or crack. It was easy to install. The zippers were smooth to close and the straps held the bag very secure to the roof rack.I decided to purchase this particular carrier based on the reviews from Amazon customers, and the price was a good deal. I do not have the space for a hard sided carrier. This folds up nice and stores in a drawstring bag!This is the first review I have posted on a purchased product, I highly recommend it."
5,very nice product,"sturdy, well made, good clasps, is not weather proof but is weather resitsant. comes with a handy carry/storage case."
5,Safe and secure,I traveled over a thousand miles in very heavy rain and windy conditions. Everything was in good shape upon arriving at our destination. We put things in heavy duty plastic bags because it stated water resistant not waterproof. Very little change in gas mileage. It holds an amazing amount of luggage and thusly freed up a lot of space in vehicle. It was a great buy!
4,Worked for what we needed; somewhat of a pain at night,"This was an economical fix for our excess luggage problem. We were able to stuff about 2 large suitcases and 2 small ones into the bag. We drove through two fierce rainstorms, and things were minimally wet.The only downside was that we had to unload it every night when we stayed at motels. The hard shell type can be locked and left. This type can be locked, but a sharp knife could cut the fabric easily to get to the contents. So unloading and reloading daily was a hassle."
4,WeatherTech Cargo Carrier,This product works well. Easy to attach & very secure. The only issue is my items got wet in a very heavy downpour. I don't know if it was because I had the zippers exposed the wrong way. I haven't had a chance to test my theory as yet though. Best thing is you don't have to drive around with it on your roof all the time like the hard carriers.
1,STUPID product,"As noted elsewhere, the frost alarm will go off no matter what you set it to unless you set the channel to something other than ""1."" Wish I could charge Oregon Scientific for the time it took me to figure that out AND for the other thermostat I bought from a different company when I became frustrated.Unfortunately, this was a gift bought in advance, so I couldn't even return it."
5,FROST ALARM -- CORRECTION,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD BUY ,, HOWEVER YOU NEED TO CALL OREGON-SCIENTIFIC FOR THE WAY TO CORRECT THE FROST ALARM FROM GOING OFF,, NO PROBLEM ,, BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE THAT CORRECTON.. THANKS FOR ASKING FOR MY REVIEW HOPE THIS HELPS ..."
1,Worthless,"I read all the instructions, and STILL can't get the outdoor sensor to work, no matter what channel I set both of them on. Don't waste your $10."
2,Great While it Lasted,"I purchased this RM382A to replace an earlier model Oregon remote thermometer that had failed after 5+ years. This RM382A was a good device, while it lasted. It operated flawlessly for 10 months. Now the remote sensor does not register. The sensor, with a new lithium AA blinks the indicator LED, but the display will not register an outside temperature. This is true even when the sensor is within 5' of the RM382A. The sensor, while outside, was under roof, and out of direct weather. I have no way of telling if the sensor failed, or the main unit failed. I'm highly disappointed with Oregon."
3,Seems Adequate,"I received mine as a gift a work, but am buying another unit so I can see the outside temp from another place in the house. I compared the reading with a glass lab thermometer and the accuracy isn't great - within a degree or two C. This is close enough for me though - placement of the sensor would cause that much variation too. In light of the degree of accuracy it seems quite silly to display the temp with tenths of a degree. We're only about 50 mile from Ft. Collins CO so the atomic clock gets itself synchronized pretty quickly."
2,Finished with Oregon Scientific,"This is the third OS product purchased; all three have had relatively short lifespans and this one the shortest...3 weeks. Outdoor sensor seems to be the weak link, stops responding after a period of time."
3,Barry Review,Product does what it is supposed to do. The readout is large and easy to see. Only complaint is there should be a way to turn off the freeze warning audible alarm which is irritating. It goes off continually. The only way to silence it is to set the outside unit on a different channel than channel 1. Perhaps Oregon should consider doing away with this feature.
2,why a clock?,"unaware of alarm clock that repeatedly sounds off for temp changes and I assume inadvertent settings on alarm,should have more specific dirctions for setting clock.Better still why have a clock on a thermostat in th first place?"
2,Problem,"The unit is not easy to program, despite the fact that it says it already is. We live in Florida (Eastern Time) and it's receiver thinks we are in the Pacific Time Zone. And it keeps flipping back to PST. Also I dont believe the temperature display for outdoors. Over all, I am not pleased"
3,Annoying Alarm,"This thermometer has been very dependable with an easy to read display, but the alarm feature is very annoying. Even when the feature is turned off, it continues to alarm when the outside temperature reaches 37 degrees F. It goes off at all hours of the day and night and must be manually turned off each time. We are taking this to our Florida home where the temperature never drops that low and replacing it with a thermometer without a temperature alarm for our northern home."
2,Small & Unreliable,"Got this elderly father could easily know the outside temp, but I found the screen to be small and difficult to read, as it's surrounded in thick black frame. Despite setting the remote sensor only 40' away, main unit lost signal intermittently. The main unit also failed to acquire the national atomic clock signal reliably, so pretty disappointing item. Returning for refund."
1,alarm issues and no response from Oregon Sci,"This is the second Oregon Sci weather device I have had. The first one worked great. I have reset, I have reprogrammed, I have done everything yet the alarm keeps going off randomly. Oregon Sci was non reponsive on queries."
2,Missing User Setting,"I read the reviews about the freeze warning alarm going off before I purchased this product. I knew there was no way to easily shut off the freeze warning alarm. Living in CT the temperature can go above and below the freeze warning termperature more than once a night during certain times of the year. Well, I thought I had found a way to de-activate the alarm without going to channel 2, but I was wrong. Woke me up at 3am in the morning one day. OK, so I tried again to de-activate, but the next night it went off and I was really upset. Finally changed both receiver/transmitters to channel 2 and was ready for a good nights sleep. NOT SO. Alarm went off at 3:32 in the morning and I was livid! To finally make it so that it will never sound again, I cut the wires to the speaker! Now what kind of poorly designed product requires cutting wires to get the desired result of no alarm? Thermometer is a few degress off plus or minus. Would not recommend buying this product."
1,The gadget designed to torment.,"How in the world can a company with the word ""Scientific"" in it manufacture a product with such an infuriating flaw? The alarm is staight out of hell. We finally threw it over the fence into the woods after being hounded incessantly with that wretched alarm. And they keep on manufacturing & selling them!!!!"
2,Crazy Alarms,"The remote and main unit synchronized quickly, and the atomic clock functioned within a couple hours - both very good. However, with no alarm indicator showing on the display screen, an alarm kept going off with no apparent reason. The instructions were scant, but I am pretty sure I got all the alarm functions off, but the alarm still sounded repeatedly. I emailed product support and they replied they would get back to me within 2-3 business days. That was 9 days ago. I removed batteries."
5,As Expected,This thermometer works as expected and the automatically updating clock is a nice touch (though common).
3,Outdoor thermometer succumbs,After working fine for 3 weeks the outdoor sending unit stopped sending. I tried new batteries in both the outdoor & indoor units without success. After a couple of e-mails & calls they have agreed to send me a replacement. Have not received it yet.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS DEFECTIVE,"I bought this product, # RMR382A I should have read the reviews first. This product has a faulty alarm that goes off at random times. We have turned the alarm on and off and it still happens. Check out the reviews, apparently Oregon Science is not getting back to anyone with a resolution."
2,TERROR OF A THERMOMTER,"THIS IS THE SECOND INDOOR/OUTDOOR THERMOMETER FROM OREGON THAT WE HAVE PURCHASED. THE FIRST ONE, A DIFFERENT MODEL AND MORE SOPHISTICATED, IS JUST GREAT--WE LOVE IT, AND IT WORKS WELL.HOWEVER, THIS MODEL GAVE US PROBLEMS FROM THE BEGINNING.FIRST, IT DID NOT SET THE CLOCK ATOMICALLY-- NO MATTER HOW LONG WE LEFT IT. WE HAD TO SET IT MANUALLY.SECOND, THE ICE/FROST TEMPERATURE ALARM FEATURE DROVE US OUT OF OUR MINDS (!!!) GOING OFF CONSTANTLY SO THAT WE HAD TO TAKE THE BATTERIES OUT AND CALL THE 1-800 PHONE NUMBER FOR HELP. WE FINALLY GOT THAT RESOLVED.LASTLY, IS THE MILITARY, TIME (!!). I DO NOT NEED TO HAVE MY CLOCK SET TO 00:00 HOURS. HOW RIDICULOUS. WE HAD TO ADJUST THAT MODE ON AND OFF AS WELL.WHAT A PAIN TO GET EVERY FEATURE TO MEET AN EVERYDAY READ-OUT!!!"
3,Thermometer,A little disappointed in MY choice. It turned out to be smaller than what I imagined but works fine and has taken its place on the table.
4,orean scientific indoor out therm.,"generally this product does everyhing it says, its new though, got to see how it holds up with more severe weather, the only thing i dont like is under many conditions it is difficult to see . its a little small in the viewing area ."
2,they're batting .500,I purchased 2 sets of these. The main unit of the first set is defective and the remote unit of the second set is defective. I combined the working units and they work fine. Haven't had the time or the energy to send back the bad units.
3,Cut the speaker wire,"Do yourself a favor and disable the speaker. The alarm goes off at random times for random reasons, even with setting the transmitter on something other than Channel 1 and changing the alarm threshold. It is so annoying, especially when it goes off in the middle of the night. (Thanks M. Lall for the suggestion.)As far as temperature accuracy is concerned, this is addressed by many other reviewers, but for under 20 dollars, it seems to be worth the price."
2,In/Out Thermometer,It works very well but it sends a signal whenever the outside temperature hits 37 degrees. It's very annoying. The signal has to be stopped each time manually but can't be permanently stopped.
2,Alarm Hell,"It is not an intuitive process to get this Thermometer to work correctly.It has an alarm buzzer which for me has gone off at 2:30AM to alert me of pending frost outside.This alarm is not mentioned in the manual, and cannot be turned off.Here in NY in February the temperature hovers in the range for the alarm to go off at all times. The Thermometer was placed under my pillow by the wife, who couldn't stand it anymore.I have now ripped the wires for the buzzer off.The settings for the regular outside temperature alarm are defaulted to low as 50F and high 80F . These settings should be higher and lower per default."
4,Great Clock/Thermometer but loses signal,"This is a great Clock/Thermometer. But every now and then it loses signal coming from the remote sensor. I was puzzled at first and changed battery few times and even put the sensor next to the clock. Still it could not find signal. Even though the changing icon indicated it found the sensor. Anyway, then I manually pressed the mem and chan button together to force it to find the sensor and then it worked. Looks like it usually loses signal in the morning. Why I do not know.Other than that it is a great stylish clock/thermometer with good range of the remote sensor."
4,How to Disable the Alarm,"For instructions on how to disable the freeze alarm, see the link on http://www2.oregonscientific.com/shop/product.asp?cid=8&scid;=5&pid;=672. Short story is set it to Channel 2, it disables the, uh, feature.Other'n that, a nice temperature gauge."
3,Multiple-channel set up.,"It is quite tricky to set up 2 sets of Main Units & Sensors in a single home, especially if the size of the house is not large enough. And a single Main Unit cannot collect data from more than one sensor, contrary to what the manufacturer claims. The User Manual is insufficient for multiple-channel set up."
2,Never completely worked out of the box,"Set-up of the unit was a bit troublesome for what it is, but I finally got it working. However, the external humidity never worked. The atomic clock reception is weak. It would not set in a location that my Citizen EcoDrive would. After less than 6 months, the outdoor senor has failed. I'll be switching to another brand."
3,You Get What You Pay For...,"It took me awhile to get the positioning right on the outdoor transmitter, I had to keep moving it and resetting it until I just about gave up and THEN it started working. It was cheap and now works fine but it would've been a hassle to send back had it not decided to work."
1,It's junk,I am on my third one of these. All three of them have died within nine months. the unit that you put outside has died on each of them. I would avoid this unit at at all cost.
2,Keep shopping - not really a bargain,We purchased two units and both seemed to eat up a set of alkaline batteries in under 30 days. Appears the range on the remote sensor is really limited (less than 25'). Annoying low/high temp alarm that is on by default with a preset low of 37degrees - that'll get your attention in the pre-dawn hours!Suppose you get what you pay for and there's probably a reason why they are heavily discounted.
3,Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer,"It's on sale because it isn't very good and it's not accurate (compared to more expensive units), but for me that's OK because it's not that serious. For the price and what it does, it's hard to complain. So it's off 2 or 3 degrees........I just want a general idea of what to expect when I go outside - - more than likely it's going to be hot in the summer. So what if it's off. It's $11.00 Where else can you find a wireless outdoor thermometer at this price? I couldn't even find a sensor at this price. For me it works and I like it."
3,disappointed,I wanted I good unit and thought this would do. I have an older and larger unit in y house that has always worked well so I was very disappointed when this one did not. The outside temp only works intermittently.
2,Not accurate,"The unit is working, but temperature measurement is about 2 degrees higher than actual. It is not acceptable since the display is showing xx.x degrees F. I expect it should be +/- 0.1 degrees accuracy."
1,oregon scientific products fail quickly,"I like to have indoor/outdoor thermometers and over the years have had many; almost all from Oregon Scientific, and they all fail, sooner or later. I won't waste my money anymore on their products. B.C."
1,obsolete and unusable,"Oregon Scientific promises to release updated software for windows 7 at the end of June. In May, the website said ""at the end of May."" A month ago, it said ""in a few weeks. The software likely will never be released; don't invest in any of their products."
2,I don't like it,This product has an alarm that goes off when temperatures reach near freezing that cannot be turned off.Very annoying.
1,Not dependable,Poor tech service--on holdat least 45 min. Devise is impossible to disable alarm. It goes off at the most inoperate time. Would not recommend it.
2,Dis-satisfied customer,"We are quite pleased with the indoor/outdoor temperature readings and clock features. We are having no success in eliminating the alarm permanently. We have tried repeatedly to make it stop, but even checking the manual has not helped."
3,works fairly well,"Cheap and effective, I had a hard time getting it to set to the atomic clock at first but after that it worked fairly well, remote transmits a fair distance..."
1,Very annoying alarm that cant be disabled.,Very annoying alarm that cant be disabled. I hope to return this product for something else. It is a constant annoyance.
2,OVER PRICED PIECE OF JUNK.,TROUBLE GETTING IT TO WORK. COMPLAINED TO CO. ASKED FOR A REFUND. ONLY GOT AN E-MAIL SUGGESTING HOW TO FIX. IT IS WORKING ON TEMPERATURE BUT THE ATOMIC CLOCK FEATURE DOES NOT UPDATE. MUST SET IT BY HAND. AS I SAY OVERPRICED JUNK.
3,Somewhat of a hassle with remote temp indicator,The remote temp indicator for outdoor temp would not work outside of a steel building. The main unit would not pick up its signal. I had to reset it to get the signal to come back once they were both inside.The main unit works great although it is very dim after 1 year due to low battery.Because it won't work through my steel building I have ordered a different model with wired temperature sensor for outdoors (they are getting difficult to find but keep looking).
2,alarm,"i bought this item for my dad for christmas thinking it would replace the recent one we had for 3 years. it was great for the first we until an alarm started going off in the middle of the night, now we cant have it one without taking the batteries out to make the noise stop."
3,Irritating,This product is typical of most new products. The instructions that come with the unit are horrible. Why do companies continue to irritate their customers with poorly written confusing instructions. Next the irritating alarm. If you want to be woke up a lot during the night purchase this product. Who wants to own a product that consistently goes off for no good reason. None of this is covered in the instructions so you have to go to the review on Amazon to find how to turn off the stupid alarm. My last purchase from this company. How difficult would it be for the company to post a video on the web to explain how to set up and make changes to the unit? This would make too much sense. The pointed haired boss from Dilbert is obviously running this company.
2,TERMOMETHER,This product is not giving me what I expect. Maybe is damage but I did not return it because it don't have RETURN PAPERS. I really don't recomend this product in my experiece with it.
2,Annoying alarm,"The unit functions quite well in displaying the indoor and outdoor temperatures. However, there is an audible freeze warning alarm that is very annoying. Although one can press a button to inactivate this alarm, it automatically resets in 24 hours, which reactivates the alarm. If one lives in an area where freezing temperatures are common, this annoyance will be a daily problem."
2,Much better after killing the speaker,"Could not figure out how to turn off the frost alarms... had to open it up and clip the wires to the speaker. It's cheap, instructions suck, but it works well enough for my purposes."
2,OK Thermometer but has stupid anoying freeze alarm.,This thermometer is well built. It has a nice easy to read display. I have become very used to checking it every day to see what the temperature inside and outside when I get up to see how to dress for the day. But I have two big gripes with it. First off it is very difficult to setup. If you have to resort to using a manual to set up a clock then someone didn't think it through when designing it.But my biggest grief is the stupid! alarm goes off when the temperature outside drops below 37F. I have tried everything in the user manual and as far as I can see there is no way to turn it off. We have been having extremely cold weather lately and about 5am the temperature outside drops below 37F and the damn alarm goes off. I am about ready to throw it away.I am addicted to having a wireless indoor/outdoor thermometer but wouldn't buy again from this company.
4,One Problem,The only problem I have with the item is that I can't deactivate the alarm feature. I do exactly as the instructions direct but it still doesn't deactivate the alarm. I am going to contact Oregon Scientific for help.
2,"Priced Right, Annoying Features","Good quality like most Oregon Scientific products. This unit is nicely priced, although it cannot display both (Atomic) time and the date simultaneously. The manual doesn't mention that the Ice Alert (at 37 degrees F) makes an audible beep series. To find out how to prevent the beep, you have to see the online FAQ's and search a very long list for the word ""Ice"". Then you have to go outdoors and get the remote and change it from radio channel 1 to any other channel. Since when does the chip manufacturer get to decide what the device's features are?"
2,"Previous version was easier to see, and better quality","This replaces a 6 yr old Oregon Scientific indoor/outdoor unit that died. I needed a basic temp unit to keep track of patio temp, and pond water temp. This unit does have the multiple channel capability. The indoor unit was only available in black (not what I would have chosen) and has a smaller screen than the previous version. Additionally, they added a 3rd row of numbers with the atomic clock, which reduces the size of all of the digits making it harder to read from across the room. Sometimes simple and basic is best.As a follow up on 9/14 - the outdoor unit has failed, new battery did not start temperature transmission to the base unit. Oregon Scientific new units are not worth purchasing. If I'd kept my receipt, I'd return it. Reduce stars to 1."
1,"Dysfunctional product, no service","Got this product as a gift, so unfortuantely did not read any reviews beforehand. Unless you enjoy a constantly recurring audible alarm day and night, which you cannot prevent (did not work to set to channel 2), this product is unusable. Two e-mail requests for help from Oregon Scientific were ignored.I cannot use this product, so minimal amount of stars. Even more important I give the same one star to the manufacturer for what seems arrogant behaviour of not answering service requests and for trying to sell a product, they know is not functioning right."
1,Poor outdoor sensor reception,"I purchased the 382A version of this product. The product has problems receiving the signal from the outside sensor and it has problems with the atomic time satellite. I've tried placing the outside sensor in various locations and the problem seems to be distance. More than a very few feet away the sensor is useless. It can read through my exterior walls because if I place the outside sensor just on the other side of the wall where the receiver is located, the receiver can read the sensor. Move it more than 5 feet away and the signal is lost. As to the atomic satellite reception, I've tried the clock in several locations inside my home to no avail. It can read the atomic signal, but it doesn't seem to be able to discern its own location because the goofy thing always reverts to Pacific time after I've set it manually to the Eastern time zone."
1,Don't Waste your Money,I have had several indoor outdoor thermometers and this isn't worth your time or money. Clock never was correct no matter how many times I would set it. The outdoor temps only showed for about 2 or 3 days then quit altogether.
1,can not turn alarm off!!,"The product was the perfect size and worked properly until the temperature in my area started to fall. Now, the alarm in the thermometer will not stop sounding. If you try to set the alarm, it just goes back to the original setting. and asks to be set once again. Unfortunately, a thermometer that sounds its alarm at any time it wants to is very annoying, especially at 2:00 a.m.!Oregon Scientific RMR382-B Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer with Atomic Clock, BlackOregon Scientific RMR382-B Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer with Atomic Clock, Black"
3,Great product at reduced price,"It's hard to imagine the constant need for the features offered by this product, unless you often share watching a movie or music while on a long flight or train ride. The dual audio outputs are a bit noisy, and the dock design limits the usefulness of this item to stationary applications. However, for the reduced price offered by select vendors (clearence, no doubt), this is a great combination external battery and dock for your ipod. Costing way less than Apple's dock, it provides similar functionality with the added benefit of the extra power... just in case you need it. Get one, before they are gone!"
4,Essential for long flights,The battery pack allows you to view the iPod hands free. The charge held from Denver to Stockholm while watching on and off during the flight. Several flight crew have asked me where they can get one for themselves. The one caution is that you can bend the charging element if you push or knock the iPod back from the intended angle. Also it's a good idea to use one of the the audio plugs in the back because if you don't have the iPod seated correctly in the base plate it isn't charging and the only way to determine that is if there is sound then you're safely charging. Good value if you're trapped on a long flight.
5,Lethal Weapon 3,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
4,Tank Girl Apocalypse,"I love the tank girl comics but this one was weird, lol. not like your usual tank girl....thats for sure :P"
1,waste of money,"My string trimmer worked well for the first year, since then it has been a total pain in the rear. I would not recommend this model, or the Ryobi line to anyone. As someone else noted, the carburetor constantly needs attention."
2,Ryobi 792 Trimmer,"I love my Ryobi orbital sander! But this trimmer's engine seized up after less than a year of frequent use, and had to be gently tapped loose with a wooden dowel. (I assumed I had somehow messed up the oil mix.) After that the carburator never would throttle down to a decent level; one day the muffler rattled off and melted the plastic engine cowl... The Ryobi 792 was a dependable starter but ran too hot and naturally wasted gas due to the throttle problem. Your other problem will be that you can't get most parts for this trimmer. Check that out before you buy one. Call around, use the Net, etc.-- before you buy."
1,spend the extra money for a Echo,The only reason I purchased it was the price had been marked down to $20 because the throttle stop screw had been broken off from the carburator body by someone else who then returned it to the store. Turns out they were factory refurbished to begin with. I was just going to take it appart and never expected it to run. Everything negative(and some positive)I've read here is true. A Echo trimmer will run silky smooth for years and I would be severly dissapionted if I paid more than $20 for this Ryobi.
5,Really different and really good,"In this sequel to The Drawing of the Three, Roland, Eddie and Susannah continue on their quest for the Dark Tower. However, as they continue, they come to realize that their paths are converging with that Jake Chambers, the boy from New York that Roland had met in The Gunslinger. But, there are monstrous obstacles on their respective paths, and they will have to work hard just to stay alive!This is another fantastic fantasy book and an excellent addition to the series. As before, I liked the strangely different world that Roland calls home, and I like how the author made it interact with our own world. As with the earlier books of the series, the action is great, with wonderfully frightening monsters to be overcome.I really enjoyed this book, and cannot wait to go on to the next one in the series. If you like good fantasy, and want to read a really different one that is also really good, then get The Dark Tower series!"
3,The series has declined.,"""The Gunslinger"" was King's most perfect synopsis of science fiction and tale-telling, for his dark man, the man even darker than the Man in Black, was also his hero. It was a tale of invention and destiny, a tale which led the read ever deeper into the world that had ""moved on"".This third book in the series, ""The Wastelands"", is plodding, predictable, and as deep as a dry puddle. The Wastelands portrays a storyline which should itself ""move on"", hopefully into realms of a little deeper imagination. The Stephen King who wrote ""The Gunslinger"" was a master of suspense, mystery, and emotion. The Stephen King who wrote ""The Wastelands"" is a potential master of CBS Sunday Night Movies starring cute little children and equally cute little dogs. Read the book so you will understand the fourth, but be warned it's not great."
1,Oh dear. Make sure you heard it before you buy it.,"After their first three albums, I was really looking forward to this new release. Unfortunately I felt that it to be an all-round disappointment -- but I realise that the band has a progressive style, and they're probably just moving away from my tastes. If you're thinking of buying this album based upon their previous albums' standards, I'd strongly recommend that you listen to the track previews beforehand. The artwork is less imaginative than previous albums, and I was disappointed by the unashamed commercialism in the lining notes. The songs seem dull and half-hearted, and (with the exception of track thirteen) the no-holds-barred, all-out crazy performances have gone, replaced with sample-based mediocrity. Perhaps it'll grow on me. Probably not."
3,great songs POOR production,"the tunes are wonderful, jimbo's arrangements are very good and show a lot of taste and intuition, BUT the production is horrible. it sounds like an contemporary adult album. some people are saying that it is funky, and some numbers are, but in light of the slick/watery production the album plays more like smooth funk or funk you might listen to if you are a middle aged white guy who ""really digs the blues."" the saving grace is that their live show is spectacular and having seen these songs performed live i can say without a doubt every tune on the album is great- live."
3,Not as good as the rest,"Although I'm a huge fan of SNZ, I have to say that this cd isn't their best work. It lacks some of the energy, creativity and funky humor that the group has always been know for. In fact, although there are a few good songs on here, the over all feel is pretty plastic, as if some music executive at Mammoth just said, ""this is what will sell, so you'll do it like this."" Jimbo still swings and Katharine's voice is as sweetly melancholy as ever, but I think the group really does miss the contributions of Tom Maxwell. All in all, if you're looking for a cd to introduce you to the Zippers, try ""Hot"" or ""Perennial Favorites."" If you're looking for new SNZ stuff try ""Katharine Whalen's Jazz Squad""; it has some of the same players and is a MUCH better buy for your buck."
4,"Good, not great","Well, I am a real fan of the Squirrel Nut Zippers, and have all of their albums (except their live one). This one just didn't quite do it for me. FOr my money, HOT is track-for-track their best; it has an energy and a cohesion that none of their other albums have acheived. Which doesn't mean that the other albums are anything to shake a stick at. Even this album, with the fantastic opener ""Bedbugs"" and the playful ""Missings Link"", is a very good listen. The song ""Hush"" is probably their greatest ballad, and so lush you'd think it came from some great old movie. However, as a whole, I just didn't enjoy this album AS MUCH AS their others; but for a band as fun as the SNZ, their worst is still worth the price of the CD."
2,SNZ Bedlam Ballroom,"Who are these people, and what have they done with my favorite band? I have six other SNZ CD's as well as Katharine Whalen's solo project and I love them all, what happened? Gone is the spooky southern aura that hung around their music. Sadly it's been replaced by a freakish mix of pop, funk, and a touch of latin beats. I miss Tom Maxwell's voice, and the only bright spot is Katharine sings a lot more on this disc. I listened then hoped and finally prayed it would get better as the tracks wound down, and it never happened. I hope this is not a new direction for such a great band. A very big disapointment"
1,"Buy Tom Maxwell's CD""Samsara"" instead.","I love the first 3 SNZ cds. This one does not live up to the standards that the first 3 set. Much has gone wrong. The main problem is that some original members have left the group and their replacements don't match up. I had the fortune of seeing the Zippers in mid-November at the Crocodile in Seattle. They are still fun live, but something is sorely missing. The sound on Bedlam Ballroom is different and not as stirring as the first 3 recordings. The ZIP is gone."
3,"Pretty good, but no ""Inevitable""...","I probably had overly high hopes for this CD in the first place....Overall it wasn't *bad*, but seemed to have a little less depth and character than their previous albums. Compared to some of the other ""swing"" albums around, it's a gem; however, if you haven't already, I would suggest getting ""The Inevitable"" instead...it's so much more sublime!!!"
2,A 5 star band produced a 2 star release,"I am a big SNZ fan. I have all 3 of their other releases and absolutely love them. I especially listen to Hot over and over. Bedlam Ballroom is a totally different experience. I am not sure what happened but the magic of before is just not there and I have listened to it over 12 times. Some songs, esp ""Do What"" are down right annoying. I hope they are not following the trend of so many other great artists who produce only garbage after becoming rich and famous. I will be seeing them in concert soon, I hope they play lots of old stuff."
3,WHAT HAPPENED TO SNZ,"The Squirrel Nut Zippers used to make very good music, their first 3 albums were just great. But somethingsa happened, some of the original members of the band left and the people they found to replace them, just arent as good. They should try to go back and see what they did in their first records and try to make the following better. Still I bought this CD because I love SNZ but I hope their next album is better."
3,Some new fun in a small square package!!!,"It is flat and square, and a whole rusty bucket of fun. The new SNZ album! I love their enhanced CD extras. This band puts alot of work into having a great time. So just sit back and enjoy the music and see this group live when you can! I am still a big fan..."
3,bringing back the zip,"After a distant turn from the first album towards the second, they seem to be headed back in the memorable direction this time around. Not that the second outing was bad by any means, but not as fun as the first. The music here is fun and moody. A great Saturday morning cd. Everything seems a bit more relaxed this time and that is noticable from the very first track. Enjoy."
1,BUY THE 8-CELL BATTERY!!!!!,"If you have the option of getting the 8-cell battery right off the bat, get it! I just received my Dell 700m and I couldn't be happier!! I wisely chose to get it with the 8 cell battery. The downside of the 8 cell battery is that it sticks out about a half inch more than the 4 cell. HOWEVER, with that added inch and about 3/4ths of a pound, you get twice as much unplugged time. That's right instead of getting the 4 cell battery that lasts 2.5 hours, get the 8 cell battery that lasts 5 hours!!! I mean if you are getting this computer to be portable all day you'll definitley want the longer power time! if you're going to get a 4 cell battery because it's smaller and lighter, and you aren't planning on being unplugged for too long, go to an auction site and bid low! you can get a 4 cell battery for 80 bucks! not over 100 like on this site."
1,Battery did not work.,This battery did not work well. It charged up once. After discharging it failed to recharge. A different battery worked well with this laptop so I don't believe the malfunction of the battery can be blamed on the PC.
1,Dell Battery- Horrible,"700m owner. Dell recalled my laptop battery due to fire hazard. They sent me a piece of junk in exchange. Very simple- someone at corporate HQ decided that since the replacements are going to cost the company big money, they decided to buy the cheapest lowest quality batteries they could find. After less than a few months the battery life started going down, until now over a year later I may get 20min. Any of these reviews that say ""oh, you shouldn't expect more than a year of life on a battery"". That's BS, where on the Dell website does it say: ""don't expect more than a year of life on your battery'? And, hey, you have to pay $135+tax+shipping for a replacement battery after a year?Matter of fact don't even buy a Dell unless you want to talk to an Indian call center where all they are trained to do is say: ""No! No! No!"", they also are rude and talk over you, and finally disconnect the call.Don't buy Dell! If you do you're an idiot."
1,beware,"the trimmer works fine, but the bearings went out prematurely. replacement was not available. so all they could recomend is to buy a new trimmer head, as in the snap on accessories like the blower,hedge trimmer,cultivator. the cost cost of any of these is ridiculous. so you might as well throw it away and buy a new trimmer. such a waste, motor is fine ."
1,loses string too fast,"I have had this product for over six years, and while it is very powerful, the string loses itself behind the opening too often. Then it requires a wrench to loosen the knob, and a total of about 10 minutes to rethread the string and carefully return it to the cartridge. Too time-consuming."
4,Thanks For The Insight,"As the son of a sergeant that served from Fiji, Bougainville, Leyte, Cebu, etc, thru Japan, I was very happy to read the General's account.I found myself riveted to the book, trying to understand my father's footsteps. The General lays out much on strategy and location; that helped a lot. I now find myself wanting to know more about what it was like for the regular GIs, the infantrymen."
3,Depends on your child,"My son loved this toy from the moment he got it. He was about eight months old and we were driving across the country. Everytime he started to get fussy I would give him the giggle kitty and it would make him laugh. Listening to it for hours in the car was a bit rough on me, but it was better than him crying! he also liked to chew on the ears and feet. It stood up to the abuse quite well :) He plays with it less now, but it was a great gift!"
4,Be careful of the ribbons!!,We brought this toy for our daughter when she was four months old. She loved the noise that it made and how it wiggled around. She is now 12months old and she still plays with it.There is one problem that we had with this toy though. She would bite the ribbons that are on the top of the head and they started to come apart so we cut them off.Other then that we love the toy.
3,"Great for awhile, but stopped vibrating/playing song.","My infant daughter received this when she was four months old. She loved it right away and it would instantly send her into giggles. It is adorable! It has great chew areas on the ears and the button that makes it work is HUGE, so no worries about little uncoordinated fingers not being able to work it.For many months it was one of her favorite ""must take it everywhere"" toy. I didn't mind the song (it doesn't last long) and the vibration and meow was cute. After we had owned it for about four months, it stopped vibrating and playing the little song. We tried everything to get it to work again and for about a day we had it ""fixed.""When it stopped vibrating, she lost interest and it has been over a year since she played with it. It will be in this spring's yard sale."
2,"Pretty Boring, Really",My son got this as a Christmas gift when he was about 7 months old. At first the noise and movement scared him but he got over that soon enough. He liked that he could cause the reaction (the button is easy to push) but he was quickly bored with it. After a few months it stopped vibrating (as was stated in several other reviews) and even changing the batteries didn't help. Now it's a year later and every once in a while he digs it out of the toy box and makes it meow a few times but then it's quickly left to gather dust again.
3,Quit vibrating,"My daughter received this as a birthday gift. It was a very cute toy & my daughter especially loved it because it vibrated. It wasn't too long after she got it ( 5 months or so) it stopped vibrating. It only meows now, which made the toy pretty boring. My daughter quickly lost interest & the toy was given away."
2,"Cute, but not much else going for it.","We got this for our daughter last Christmas when she was about 9 months old, but she hasn't shown much interest in it. She has picked it up perhaps 3 or four times in the last year.Despite the lack of use, however, it has somehow managed to be broken in the first 6 months. it now only makes a meowing sound when the button is pushed. It no longer vibrates. It may be cute, but the quality and entertainment level is low. Also, while it may provide some sensory input (provided that it doesn't quit vibrating), it has no real educational value at all."
2,Not for skiddish children,I really liked this toy but my daughter had other feelings about it. I bought it when she was about 6 mths old and when I showed it to her in the store she seemed to enjoy it. When I got it home however that was another story. I gave it to her and pushed the belly and when it vibrated she screamed. I tried it with her the other day and she seems to like it now. She's 9 mths old now.
5,gets a smile everytime,I know it says it is for babies 6 monthes and up but my 3 month old loves this kitty. We also have the Bounce and Giggle puppy. She smiles and laughs out loud every time we play with it. Sometimes her kitty is the only thing that calms her down when she is fussy.
3,Fun but there better toys,"I got this for my daughter t hinking it was cute and she'd love learning cause and effect from it. Well, it has taken me 3 weeks to get her to look at it without crying. She scares easliy, therefore the bumping, giggling, and music scared her at first. Now that she is use to it she plays with it every now and then, and usually it scares her if she hits it by accident.My dog loves it though!"
4,Very fun,"All small children love this toy and play with it for at least five minutes at a time. My battery plate hinge broke when it was dropped one too many times, but it's been roughed up quite a bit and the rest is still in tact. It's so much fun that I taped the battery plate back on so we could continue using it."
1,Waste of money,"We received this gift from Grandma and Grandpa and I feel bad, but it was a waste. My child was never interested in it because all it does is meow and vibrate. I think there are many other toys out there that are more fun and a better value."
2,Cheap but don't expect too many hours of thrills for baby,"I would say that this is a good toy to have around for your little one just as an occasional ""giggle-getter"". It can be a little frightening since it makes ""meow"" sounds and vibrates like it has been electrocuted but my infant seemed to like to watch it for a few minutes until about the time she turned 1 at which time she became totally bored and un-amused with it.Since it's not too expensive -- maybe worth the buy."
3,It's okay,"I received this toy as a gift. My daughter is 6 months old and doesn't know how to press the button yet, so I have to be there to press the button for her. It is too heavy for her to pick up which really frustrates her. She wants to hold it up to her face and suck on the ribbons on top. When I do press the button for her, it bounces away from her putting it out of reach.It's cute and its fun. She likes the noises it makes. I get bored of it quickly because it makes the same noises and doesn't change at all. It also ends really quickly. It's funny if you place it up-side down on the botton. It becomes possessed. This cracks me up more than her. My cat on the other hand really doesn't like this toy!All of this said and done, it's OK. I don't think I'd have bought it myself."
1,Utterly terrified by this toy,"I picked this up for my usually outgoing, happy 6 month old--he loves the family cat, and any other ""noisemaking"" toy he has been exposed too. (Admittedly I'm not a fan of the noisemaking toys, but this one seemed cute and I assumed he would love it.)I sat him down on the floor, pressed the button and he screamed--in terror. The poor little guy wimpered and shook for a good twenty minutes. He has never reacted to any toy, person, animal, place or situation so strongly. I read that another child is scared of the Bounce & Giggle Puppy, but assumed it was just a quirk that her daughter found it evil. Unfortunately, my son is scared to death of the kitty !"
2,Not worth the money,"We got this toy when my daughter was only 9 months old. She wasn't very interested in it then. Now, at 17 months, she still doesn't even looks at it. Yes, it meows and shakes, but doesn't seem to be any fun for her. She'll push the button once, maybe twice, then put it down and forget about it for another couple of weeks. Don't waste your money on this toy. There are planty of other more interactive things for your baby to play with."
1,Bad Times Video Quality,"Good Times took an excellent movie, and ruined it by putting it on third rate video tape, recorded at LP speed. I would rather pay a few dollars more for a video that I can watch.Right out of the box and into the VCR, the video was shaky and grainy. After a few minutes, I needed to take Dramamine just to continue.Fond childhood memories of watching this wonderful movie have been spoiled because of the atrocious quality. I'd recommend passing on this one."
1,"Great film, terrible video quality","Truly a wonderful movie, but the quality of the VHS video we received from Amazon.com was terrible. The images were fuzzy, the sound scratchy and the video would not track properly."
2,dosnt work.,every other dvd has been great though.But this one is set in wrong settings so we cant watch it.so sad.love this movie.
5,"acting,scenery,music all there","I saw this movie when it first came out. Very underated by critics as the acting by Holden and Schroeder is excellent. I really felt for the characters. The music is, for me, spiritual. I have been trying in vain for years to secure the song sung by Maureen McGovern. Don't know the name but it means so much to me.Let us get it on DVD."
5,This is the Best Terrine Pan,"This is an excellent terrine pan that I use at home and at work. The cast iron construction allows for even heating, which is paramount to cooking the perfect terrine. If you're serious about making great pates and other terrines, buy this terrine pan now. You won't regret it."
5,Still Fresh,"Boy this CD brings me back... I had _Fontanelle_ on tape when it first came out and the tape broke a few years back, and I just recently brought the CD. Handsome and Gretel still rocks, Real Eyes is still spine tingling, and Mother is still haunting. There is more energy in just one song than all those newfound ""divas"" have put together."
5,Great for fans of ANGRY Gril Rock!,"""Fontanelle"" rules! I like ""Bruise Violet"" and ""Bluebell"" A LOT! This is even better than most, if not all, L7 or Bikini Kill CDs. Honestly. In my opinion, this is the best Babes in Toyland CD."
4,You want a bloody nose wid' dat?,"Simply put, if you're into straight-ahead punk rock, this album will knock your socks off. If your idea of punk rock is Blink 182, don't bother. There are no goofy radio ballads here. In intensity and listenability, Fontanelle is somewhere between The Distillers 'Coral Fang' and Hole's 'Live Through This'. Good soundtrack for a fast drive through a war zone - a corporate dinner party? Not so much. Why else would it be named after the soft spot in a baby's skull?"
5,A fantastic resource,"My husband and I took this with us on our honeymoon to Cozemel. What an EXCELLENT resource it proved to be! The reviews and suggestions were right on the money. We appriciated the personal input and specifics for sites, activities, resturants, etc - it was as though a good friend was giving you traveling advice.The book is well layed out and easy to navigate.We carried this with us during our site-seeing adventures both on and off the island and it proved to be invalueable. There is no question that our trip would not have been as outstanding had we not had it."
2,Huge disappointment,"I've enjoyed music from this choir or its predecessors since 1967 and was excited about getting a Christmas album recorded by them. What a disappointment. This is so far below the glory of their prior works. The arrangements and recording are simply sub-par from what fans of this group have grown accustomed to. This sounds like a bootleg of a rehearsal tape, and many of the songs aren't ready for concert by a long shot."
1,dissappointed,My daughter loves dogs. She described the book as boring and demanded a second bedtime story. The entire book is in the title and reading the one hundred names twice did not seem to capture my child's interest.
2,Disappointing book,"If the story would have been about The Very Kind Lady and Her One Hundred Dogs it would have been better. The focus on the fact that she was a rich lady didn't add any meaning to the story (except, perhaps, that she is able to have 100 dogs and take care of them.) As a picture book, the illustrations are interesting and the dogs have funny and silly names (all 100 are listed twice.)As a story, however, it lacks substance. The fact that the lady is described as a very kind rich lady throughout the book and not just as a very kind lady never sounds right to me."
2,Not well written,Simple-minded characters and a weak plot make this book not worth the money or time. My expectance was something of the Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings genre and all I got was Humpty Dumpty.
1,Not Happy,when I select to buy the book the label said that the book was in good condition but when I received it the book missing some pages the back part of the book was missing also the CD was missing even the book has a sticker saying that the CD was included
4,This is not an unabridged dictionary,"In terms of value for money, this is a very good dictionary, but do not expect too much. I bought the dictionary to help me work through a recent spanish novel set in the middle ages and written in a literary style. About half of the words I looked up were not listed in this dictionary."
5,Best Dictionary with Best Car CD Course!!,"With 80,000 entries along with the compact size and low price, Merriam-Webster's Spanish-English Dictionary is the best in the west, not the least in the east.I use this dictionary constantly for all my Spanish-English needs.I have an excellent car Spanish course named Behind the Wheel Spanish which fortunately does not require the use of a dictionary while I drive, but rather gives me all the meanings instantly.Still, if you need a reference, this is the best for the money.If you really want to learn to speak Spanish, then I recommend you also buy Behind the Wheel Spanish 8 CD and book version.Great combo overall."
1,Defect !!! Multiple blank pages,THIS DICTIONARY HAS MULTIPLE BLANK PAGES. OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT. NOT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE TO RETURN THIS CHEAP CHEAPLY MADE DEFECTIVE PAPERBACK DICTIONARY.VERY DISAPPOINTED !!
4,It's ok,"This is just a very basic Spanish-English dictionary. It will help with simple things, but there are much better dictionaries available."
5,gift for brother,"Product was delivered in a time fashion, exactly as described. He loves it and says that it helps him a lot for what he is using it for."
3,A little help with pronunciation please.,Susan Stubbs makes a great point about vulgar word warnings. I would add this: I suppose this dictionary will help you with reading but suppose I want to SPEAK the word? This dictionary does not indicate how to say the word. I suppose that would be an inclusion of a phonetic pronunciation that I'm looking for.
3,Good content but not the highest quality printing,I use this dictionary quite a bit as it is small enough to be light and easy to carry and big enough to contain most everyday words. I think that the content is good but I compared to my other (larger) dictionary by Harper Collins the paper is somewhat gray and the words don't stand out as well. Also the ink is not the most permanent so if you are not careful you can end up with gray stains on your fingertips. I would recommend spending slightly more to get something with a higher quality of paper and printing.
3,Adequate,"For basic classroom use, the ""New"" Merriam-Webster's is fine and the verb references back to examples shown for irregular conjugations are quite helpful. However, it fell short of my expectations with the introduction being hard to decipher. The printer fonts aren't reader friendly and the quality of the paper is less than good compounded by the ink smearing easily. I've found myself returning more than once to an extremely worn pocket edition from the University of Chicago to find words not listed and to supplement or clarify certain words, idiom phrases and various reflexive verb definitions. Ironically, my purchase was intended to replace this old sidekick which I'm now glad I didn't toss."
4,Merriam-Webster's Spanish-English Dictionary,"This Spanish to English Dictionary is very useful,it has over 725 pages of translated word and easy to read.I expected more definition information, but for the price it's good."
2,Not my favorite one,"I liked this okay until I recieved the Oxford Spanish Dictionary. It is huge! I love it. This Merriam-Webster dictionary is good for carrying around though, but I really highly recommend the Oxford one!"
4,Excellent portable reference work,"This small (7""X4"") dictionary, along with ""Barron's Spanish Verbs"", is my much used reference for an attempt to learn spoken Spanish. Its size and general comprehensiveness makes it essential as well as handy, in class and out. At 735 pages, it's crammed with vocabulary and some grammar explanations, but it doesn't seem bulky and isn't difficult to tote to class.As a beginning student, I haven't yet failed to find a word needed for my level. The only small criticism that I would offer is that while definitions and usage are mostly clear, occasionally it's necessary to check on whether a word is used universally. I've compared the M-W Spanish-English Dictionary with those being used by classmates, and it is better by far than most anything else available.."
4,"Good dictionary, easy to use",This book is easy to use and full of excellent vocabulary for a beginning Spanish speaker. On a few occasions I was not able to find the word I was looking for but I did find close substitutes and was able to complete my assignments for my Spanish class.
4,A good Spanish-English dictionary,This dictionary is fairly comprehensive. My only complaint would be the print is a little small for my aging eyes...
5,must have for students learning the spanish language,"like most of our dictionaries, this book begins with Explanatory Notes, which includes gender labels, inflected forms, pronounciation, etc. this category is followed by Spanish Grammar, which is limitlessly priceless when you move to the conjugtive verbs and forward.an ideal tool for reeeally learning Spanish. a lot more than just conversationally."
4,Good to keep in your backpack,"This is more complete than my mini spanish-english dictionary, but less complete than some of the bigger ones that my classmates own. The beginning has some information about spanish and some practice activities, which several classmates have found helpful. Great price and reasonable size."
5,Great Resource,In my Intermediate College Level Spanish course this dictionary has proved very helpful.
3,"If you trust this one, you may offend","While good in every other way, this dictionary is missing a vital part for anyone who wants to be able to communicate without embarrassment. It neglects to warn of vulgar words and phrases. It skips from ""shirt"" to ""shiver"" in the English section. On the Spanish side, it fails to tell that, while ""coger"" is a perfectly ordinary and acceptable way to say ""to take"" in Spain, it is very vulgar in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. There are many other examples, but it is not necessary to cite them here.Whether you are looking to offend or looking to avoid offending, Merriam-Webster's will not help you. Always check. If this feature is missing, keep looking. The University of Chicago Spanish-English Dictionary, Cassell's Spanish & English Dictionary , and others do list and warn of vulgar and extremely vulgar words in both English. Whatever they cost, they are a much better buys."
5,Perfect for student,I purchased this book for my daughter who is a freshman in high school. It was just what she needed for her Spanish II class. Price was great and shipped very quickly.
4,Great resource,"This is an additional resource to my Spanish-English software, audio CD's and internet forums and online dictionaries. Very helpful when on the go."
2,Not Phoenix OR Gold,I did receive a functioning Firewire cable but it did not have gold plated tips. Seller refunded $1...
5,It's a cable afterall.,"When ordering from BargainCell you get the black cable in the second picture, not the clear one. Overall this performs well and the build quality is solid. With casual use this will last forever.If you need a cable like this then this is a great bargain for a dying standard."
5,Works great,I ordered 2 of these because my co-worker and I needed longer cables for our printers. They arrived quickly and work great. The price is right -- no need to pay more!
3,Im sure it would be a great cable if it was not broken,Very reasonable price and fast shipping. Problem is the 4-pin connector had a couple of bent prongs. This in turn bent the prongs on my laptop. Luckily i had a warranty on the computer.
2,Wrong product shipped,The advert was for a Phoenix Gold IEEE-1394 4-Pin/6-Pin FireWire Cable (2 Meters). What I received was a Regular IEEE-1394 4-Pin/6-Pin FireWire Cable which I could have purchased for $2.99 (canadian) at my local electronic store. The price I paid was $1.99 for the wire and $5.00 shipping.
3,NOT as Advertised and Pictured,"1. ""Phoenix Gold IEEE-1394 4-Pin/6-Pin FireWire Cable (2 Meters)"".2. ""Quad shielding rejects RF and EM interference"".3. ""Gold-plated connectors improve signal transfer"".Definitely not gold plated. Not the same insulation as pictured (so how can we know about the shielding?). No brand name, Phoenix or otherwise. on the plain plastic bag it came in. So, mis-advertised on three counts.Okay, I paid a whopping $1.08. But I expect to get the item described, regardless. SO CHANGE THE DAMNED MISLEADING DESCRIPTION if you're not providing the ""Phoenix Gold"". The item was shipped and received promptly (thank you). But based on this relatively minor aggravation, would I order again from this seller? Absolutely not."
1,Stay away from this cable,It doesn't fit in my sony handycam..as per policies you can't get back your shipping costs..so useless purchase for me..stay away from this one...
5,"Bought It, Used It, It Works.","I halfway didn't expect it to work because it's so inexpensive. (Thank goodness Radio Shack didn't have any.) I used it to connect my Sony DV Cam to my iBook to import video. The connection to the iBook is a little tight, but it doesn't cause any problems. It works perfectly. I don't find the cable to be stiff (as someone here did), but I don't see what difference that would make unless you plan to jump rope with it. For once, an actual bargain! Buy it and brag about how cheap you got it!"
3,Not Phoenix Gold,I received a Ieee-1394 4-Pin/6-Pin Firewire Cable (2 Meters)But it was not a Phoenix Gold Cable. In fact i ordered another one and it turned out not to be a Phoenix Gold. Too much trouble to return them. They serve the purpose. They were just not what was advertised when i ordered them. I was disappointed they were not gold.
2,Not like the photo in the add.,Shown as Gold firewire and it was not. They sent me a generic regular not gold plated firewire cable. It works it is just not as good a quality as was pictured and as I was hoping for. Be cautious when purchasing from this seller.
1,Phoenix IEEE-1394 Cable Compatibility,"The 4 pin connector was overlarge. It would barely go into my DVD recorder, but would not connect to my Sony camcorder at all. (I tried another brand, which fit easily into both.) If look are looking for a cable for your Sony camcorder, don't buy this one."
5,Never buy cables from a brick and mortar store,Got these instead of paying primo price at Best Buy. works great with my video camera.
3,Working Cable--NOT item pictured,"This cable was average quality. It fit my sony handycam fine. It looks exactly like the cable that came free with my firewire card--Black sheathed cable with silver connections. It is not the item pictured by ""Clear""AV. I think their company and item name are purposely misleading. I wasn't looking for a ""monster"" cable--it's a digital interface, either it works or it doesn't. I expected something that had better quality material or craftmanship than a freebie, but it's not."
3,The Mid-1990s,The Mid 1990s was an often confusing time in music because their were so many musical trends clashing with each other. Ujnfortunatley that would lead back into the teeny bopper generation just like 1989-1991. The reasons the 1990s has a hard time being remembered is because you cannot sum it up in a short time you have to go year by year. This is a good collection and if you're a 1990s fan you will like this album.
2,Worst in the Series,"This is my least favorite and probably the worst in the series, probing the myth of fairies from around the world. Studies Tolkien here as well as a source of the myth."
1,Be careful ordering from J&R music world,"We purchased this based on everyone's reviews - but J&R music world sent us the European model instead of the American model. Which means we have to run out and buy an additional adapter. So far I have not tried it. Just very disappointed that they would send out the wrong model. Normally I would return for the correct one - but we are expecting our child in a week (the sole reason we bought this camera) so now, off to Fry's to fix their screw up."
3,In Your Eye! (Extended Life Battery),"Just bought this Sony HDR-SR7 Camcorder and I can not believe that you can NOT plug a USB port cable into the camcorder , you can only connect and download data via USB cable, that is connected to the HandyCam Station. There is NO USB port on the camcorder it's self. Go figure??Now that I also bought the ""Extended Life Battery"", it's always nice to have the extra power pack alon...the battery sticks out half as much more than the original ballery, just enough to sick you right in the eye when you are trying to use the camcorder eye view finder. Not to mention the fact that you have to mess around with a required ""FH to AC input"" cable (If not in your eye, it's in your face. Way to go SONY, it looks like the extended battery design was an ""After the Fact"" design idea!Bottom-line, save yourself the hassle, check out other makes features first!Nash from Seattle, WA"
5,HD on HDD rocks!,"Camera has an easy button, but doesn't need it. It's easy and intuitive on it own and the videos are awesome. The 6.1 still pics are great and being able to take 3 while videotaping is way cool. Still pic resolution is really good, not digital SLR quality, but really impressive. Only problem I have had is finding a mini HDMI cable which isn't included. Everyone seems to be out of stock. I guess that's the price you pay for technology. Otherwise, camera is awesome."
3,Not Mac compatible,"I am using this camera, and it is nice. However, my biggest gripe is that it is not Mac compatible. Many creative types use a Mac, which comes with very nice movie software. I have both Macs and PCs, but would have preferred to use my Mac.Because it wasn't compatible, I purchased Sony's Vegas, but would have been much happier using iMovie."
4,Amazing picture,"I bought this camera as a birthday present for my tech geek boyfriend. The video quality is amazing! However,copying the video to DVD is extremely difficult. You need a 2007 computer for things to run smoothly, otherwise be prepared to put in the time. All in all the camera is awesome. We recorded my dog running in slow motion and then watched her in slow motion and the individual frames were clear. It would be great for coaches to help athletes in training. Still picture quality is good, too."
1,Disappointed,"I have been a big Sony fan for years, especially in regards to digital cameras. This camcorder was a big disappointment though. I dont mind paying the extra bucks coz its Sony, and its HDD and HD but I expected the same Sony quality that I have seen in their digital still cameras. The indoor video quality on the HDR-SR7 is extremely poor. Even in HD the video is very grainy. I have an 8 month old baby so I am going to be doing lots of indoor videos for years to come so I want something that produces good quality indoor video. This is not it."
1,buffer overflow and data error,"I rated this item low although I really like the camera for most things. There is one MAJOR problem I have seen. When I record my son's garage band in the highest quality, the recording mode kicks off after about 30 or so seconds whith a ""buffer overflow"" message followed by a ""data error"" message. When the noise level being recorded is more ""reasonable"", the recording proceeds without a problem. Now I am looking for a way of attaching an external mic that will ""dampen"" the volume to a level the camera can handle. However, it seems that the camera should do that on its own.Any suggestion on how I can record this very loud, rock and roll event successfully? Type of mic, etc."
4,Stunning video detail,This Sony Handy cam has the best recorded picture I have seen. Even in low light it is able to focus and bring out colour. The zoom also remains crystal clear with no grain.The still photos are not as good which was a bit of a disapointment. On the whole a great bit of kit.
1,"""Buffer Overflow Error"" and ""Data Error"" messages","I got this camcorder for thanksgiving holidays. First two days of recording was great but on the third day of use, I kept getting ""Buffer Overflow Error"" and ""Data Error"" messages. I know that formatting the disk might fix the problem but at the same time doing so resulted in me loosing all that was recorded that day. I returned the device and got a refund."
4,Sony HDR-SR7,"Great image quality, easy intuitive touch screen menu...no need to read the owners manual...just turn it on and start recording. I looked at six or seven HD camcorders before choosing this one...great camcorder."
5,Best camcorder I've ever owned,"After doing months of research, reading product reviews and going to camera stores for hands on comparisons I finally settled on the Sony HDR-SR7. The best investment I could have made. I used the night vision function to film Halloween night activities, The HD is beautiful and crisp and it's ability to film low light events is unsurpassed.The 60 GB hard drive has more than enough capacity, Hours of recording time I haven't even come close to running out of memory. I've used this unit now for about 2 months and have no complaints at all."
1,Sony electronics have gone downhill just like Sony computers,"I have owned many sony products. They were all pretty good except their computers which are totally junk. I owned DCR-TRV17,DCR-HC40 camcorders and they were good and pretty reliable. Now for this HDR-SR7, it is a totally junk. Focus is a problem. Wherever the unit got hot, the image becomes totally pink. I searched online, there are many similar reports in videohelp forum. I owned a few Canons, all the way from cheap consumers models to GL1,XL1S,XL2 professional cameras. They are always reliable and always improving. Sony just needs to go bankrupt and reborn.It is hopeless."
3,2.5 years later,"After 2 years, I bought a new battery since it wasn't keeping much of charge. Six months after buying the new battery, it too doesn't keep a charge very well. Needless to say it is frustrating when the battery was fully charged on Good Friday but only provided 3 minutes of video recording on the big Easter egg hunt day. This seems very odd to me, unless I purchased a defective battery, that a camera, over time, would consume the battery this much with the camera off for 1.5 days."
5,Great Camera!,"It's easy to use and wonderfully clear. It did take me some time to figure out how to make it record in normal mode, not hi-def, but once that was done it worked great. Also, I couldn't figure out how to convert the hi-def files into something that could be watched on the computer - like flash or something, but I am new to the world of video editing so that might just be a user problem. The camera is awesome."
4,Balanced and works,Fair price. It is balanced and works. What more can I say about it? It is sharp. Make certain your router supports the larger shank.
2,NEW JERSEY DRIVE WAS BULLSHYT......,Jacking cars ridin around....come on....wasted talent...the only bright spot in the flick was HEAVY D... and his light was dimmed by this street corner foolishness...save your money this was shyt...
1,Bad customer service,Received a bottle of hemp oil in December with the safety seal taken off and little shreds of it around the rim of the bottle. The bottle had obviously been opened/used. It's unusable to me. I contacted this company and they said they would send a replacement and never have. Don't do business with people like this. Use another company.
5,Fun lessons for Children,"This is a nice compliment for Slovenly Peter which works for boys. This is the girls version. It gives parents an opportunity to teach children with a little ""tongue in cheek""."
1,No illustrations,"I wished I had read the reviews before puchasing the ""Affordable & High Quality Paperback Bood Edition"" I was very disappointed with this version - no illustrations which are vital to the whole ""Slovenly Betsy"" experience. A dear friend passed way recently - she was in her 80's and among her most prized possessions was her ""Slovenly Betsy"" hardcover book from which she would read stories to my children - One of many fond memories of her. I am going to continue to try to find a paperback with pictures!"
1,Where are the illustrations???,"My review is specific to the ""Affordable & High Quality Paperback Edition"" of this book. The Amazon's ""Look Inside"" option is false and misleading. There are NO illustrations in this edition, which can be compared to reading the Sunday comics without the pictures to go along. If you want to order this delightful book by Heinrich Hoffmann, do not bother ordering this edition, you will be bitterly disappointed."
5,Well-crafted pop tunes,"Why give a ""pop"" album 5 stars? Well, ""pop"" is short for ""popular,"" and that's shorthand for ""crowd-pleasing"". Texas' crowd-pleasing music makes for great listening around the house, in the car, anywhere. This collection pulls together a nice variety of material to make it a diverse and representative collection.So, buy it. You'll be part of a very pleased crowd."
5,B3 - Young ladies love them,"A good new ""boyband"" in the tradition of boybands but with a Beegees flavor. Hopefully they will be back to the US soon. B3 seems to have found quite a following in Europe and they spend most of their time performing there. My daughter's found the B3 CD at Amazon quite by accident and like them."
2,Shop Vac 962,"I ordered this item and found it was not what I thought it would be because the description on Amazon was not complete and the customer service person at Amazon could not be of any help. In fact, I could not understand most of what he said. When I asked what country he was from he hung up... Terrible customer service. The vacuum needs a handle and other fetures like the Ridgid vacuums sold at Home Depot. The Ridgid has so many features that make it a very practicle tool."
2,very poor shape,"Almost unusable, but still readable so i suppose i got what i paid for. This is not a suitable alternative for the newer edition though. So if you need the third, then you had better buy the third."
1,"I never received this item, and I have paid for it!!!","I am still waiting on this book to arrive through the mail. I needed and still need this book. Pleeaassee send. Thanks,ps. I know we all make mistakes and overlook some things. Lorraine, social worker in Michigan."
1,What A Stinkaroo!!,"Hey, these juvenile, formulaic Elvis movies must have reached the nadir on this bomb. While all of his movies were terrible, ""Change of Habit"" might be the worst of a very bad bunch."
4,A little known gem of a movie,"Personally, I think this is one of Elvis' better movies. He plays a more serious role than in many of his other films and is well cast beside Mary Tyler Moore. The storyline is interesting and more intense than you might expect.I removed a star from the rating because the film was marketed as lighter fare than it should have been. I don't think that the actors were allowed to create the depth of character that would have taken the film to the next level."
5,A++ for this seller,"highly recommend buying from this seller, completely satisfied - product came in a very timely manner, well packaged, no complaints and I will certainly recommend this seller to anyone"
4,"""You gotta be kidding!""","This movie is one of the funniest dramas I have ever seen. Elvis as a doctor in the ghetto is so unbelievable that the comedic value of the movie is astronomical. There are such quotes as ""He called my sister a dirty stinkin'...no one calls my sister dirty!"" and ""knifing a player in football deserves a 15 yard penalty"". While it tries to raise serious issues including the role of the church, civil rights, racism, and autism, you come away with nothing but a bad case of side burns. If you want to see Elvis as a hero- do not buy this film. Yet if you find humor in bad social commentary which includes Elvis and Mary Tyler Moore this movie is for you! I loved it for this reason."
3,How Times Have Changed,"Indeed. I guess you have to look at this movie in this context. It looks dated, kind of like those really bad TV shows of the late 60s and early 70s. The dialogue is terrible, laughable at some points - ""she was raped, even against her will"" - give me a break!Elvis looks good, before he blimped out on cheeseburgers and drugs and Mary Tyler Moore is her usual annoying self - its said they didnt get on - not unsurprisingly.The supporting cast is not too bad - good to see Ed Asner in an early role. This is one of Elvis lost films, so to speak, in that if you are not a fan then you would not really know about it.Worth a look. The DVD is good quality as is the VHS. The songs are pretty duff but whats new?It looks like he was trying to get his movie career back on track but was perhaps side tracked by live performances."
4,Rare role for Elvis,"I caught this movie on American Movie Classics when they were having an Elvis movie marathon. I have to say this is one and very few GOOD Elvis movies.In this movie, he's not some struggling musician with 40-year old women helping him along. I think if he wasn't a puppet with the strings being held by a certain manager, he could've made more movies like this one.True, he does sing a little, but it's a hobby for his character. I don't think I can say any more than what the other reviewers have said, but take my word for it, this is one and very few good Elvis movies."
5,best elvis,"This by far is one of Elvis's best movies. I had read once that he really did not like doing movies, that he didnt fancy himself an actor. Yet it really feels and looks like he really ejoyed doing this one."
3,Serious Movie Deserved Better Production,"While his ""new"" music, including the very important title ""In The Ghetto"", was getting good notice across the world, this socially-conscious movie was in release. Unfortunately, the ""Made For TV"" quality made this respectable effort a minor work, which did showcase strong performances by Presley as an inner city Doctor and by Mary Tyler Moore as a Nun who wants to try a different approach in a complex setting. The music is very agreeable and is well interpolated - dig Elvis on piano (""Lawdy, Miss Clawdy"") and singing along with Darlene Love (""Rubberneckin'""). The somewhat non-traditional ""Let Us Pray"" number might suggest the controversial ""gospel rock"" of future decades. The difficult physical/spiritual theme warranted more time and attention than was presumeably allowed and perhaps accounts for the film's lesser-known status."
4,Elvis in Change of Habit,"If you love Elvis movies, you'll love this one as well! There isn't much singing in it, so this movie has a more realistic feel to the story than most of Elvis' movies. This movie proves that you don't have to show explicit sexual scenes to have a thought provoking story."
4,One of my favorite characters,"out of 3000+ books I have read. Much better reading than Clockwork Orange. Be with Mr. Enderby as he cooks, makes love and disses the Beatles. I would recommend the first book in the series to anyone. The subsequent books are not quite as good but better than most fiction.And if you disagree with me, for cough"
3,What?,"There IS an African American doll by Fisher Price, on the very same page. How rude is it to post something like that before knowing for sure? This is a place for people who HAVE the toy to respond.My daughter got this toy when she was born. I'm getting rid of it because like everyone else, the rattle hit her in the head and gave her a bruise. She's 7 months. My two year old sister had the same problem."
5,Love at first squeeze,"My daughter is now 22 months and she's had this doll since she was 8 months old. It is soft and huggable. She just loved it the first time she grabbed it. She's had it for over a year, it's been thru the washer and dryer more times than I care to count and still looks great. It's her favorite toy."
4,"My cat TIMMY, loves it !!!","My cat Timmy, loves this house! He loves to go in it.He always sticks his head out of it. He also likes to sleep in it. The cheese house was bigger than I imagined. This house is usually good for cats under medium size. It is really colorful and has big space inside. He went in it right when we got it for a Christmas present.It is really soft and cushy. I think it is a really good house for cats!"
3,again region1 not region4 as i thought,"same feedback as black shield of falworth,lucky ihave a multi region dvd player,I will read item description much more carefully next time"
3,Another giant rock story!,"Let's see. George Pal told the same story in 1951's ""When World's Collide"". Almost fifty years later, ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"" would cover similar territory in 1998.Chronologically, ""Meteor"" falls in the middle, being released in 1979 when the ""disaster epic"" was on the wane.Billed at the time as American-International's most expensive production, it does have a stellar cast, state-of-the-art (for the day) special effects, good action scenes, a tense-filled script, and a tolerable score.While definitely not a ""classic"", it's a nice companion piece for those interested in seeing how Hollywood ""revisits"" itself."
1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"After just watching this on TV, I wondered what others would think of it. How did this get more that 1 star? Horrible acting, effects that stink, and space-platform ""secret"" rockets, designed to shoot ""DOWN"" from space to the earth ( a trip that would last maybe 10 minutes, depending of the target)whose engines ""burn"" for more than 20 minutes+! Plus the fact that somehow the missles from the USSR and USA never collide with each other, but fly in neat rows. What a joke!Sure, the premise is viable,and the cast top-notch, but this film is a waste of time."
1,How The Heck?,"In 1979, I would probably guess that big name studios like MGM would have better morals than to put out this pathetic excuse of a movie. Boring, unintriging, and badly acted, this movie will have you on the edge of your seat, to run into the next room covering your eyes at it's badness.I don't mean to diss, but man. This movie is awful. Why would I recommend this? How can I? I'll just simply put it like this. I'm not."
2,Crash and Burn,"This flick is a waste of time, talent, and money. This is possibly the worst film Sean Connery has ever appeared in. Hammy acting, leaden direction, inept storytellying, etc. It's worst offense is the super cheesy special effects. They don't even pass the mustard with the original ""Star Trek"" standards. Heck, ""Plan 9"" had more convincing visuals. Another debit is the depiction of the destruction of the World Trade Center which is of dubious taste in light of the events that followed. This movie doesn't warrant enough camp to meet the ""MST2K"" criteria."
1,Librarian and avid hiker,"The subtitle of this book is deceiving. I am quite knowledgeable about hiking and recreation areas north of New York City. Major areas such as Bear Mountain/Harriman State Park were not included. This park complex contains over 250 miles of marked hiking trails, camping, and fishing. Park managers are not likely to know this book is available and request to be included. A good road map or the information booklet mentioned in the notes would tell of the existance of open space. With a 1993 copyright date, this book should have been republished. Fortunately the Web provides far more current information to those outdoor enthusiasts who are looking for places to go on vacation. I would not buy the book, because information is lacking in an area what I know quite well."
4,"Murder and Magic, quite a mix!","The reason for the one-star ding first of all: Always tell the story through Doctor Watson, never through a third party! That's a big no-no to all Holmes fans. Holmes stories are narrated by Watson!Now the story. A mad magician out for revenge! People in high society involved in secret experiments gone wrong and covered up! The suspect a dead man! His calling card assorted pieces of a dead woman's body! The offical police don't want Holmes help! Holmes is refused access to newpaper morgues and must resort to stealing what he needs! A blowgun is involved! A femme fatale is involved! Holmes resorts to digging up the dead, vowing to give up practice if he is proven wrong-- and there is a body in the grave! Great stuff and well written, although, uh, (pst. Is an Australian Death Adder the infamous Taipan?)Quoth the Raven..."
5,Such an inspiration,I think the whole idea behind this album is brilliant. I could only imagine what it must be like finding out all those incredible things about your mom. One of the best ways to express everything is through music and Shawn Amos did an excellent job portraying his mom's life. I highly recommend this album!
1,WARNING,This Steelex bit is worthless for drilling steel. I tried to drill one hole through 3/16 steel for several minutes and never finished it. Buy the Bosch Cobalt bits -- they are great!
5,hidden treat,"The entire package is great but there's something special about the final four tracks on the first disk: all are gorgeous love songs strung together without gaps or breaks and Sunshine of my Life has a delicious horn track that even seems to bring up the rhythm track. Like a fine bottle of wine everytime I hear that set. I like it so much I had to pick it up in vinyl, too!"
1,Product Not As Represented,When this CD arrived it was NOT the 2CD version - it was Original Musiquarium 1 VOLUME 1 - very disappointed and a waste of money.NOTE: The item I purchased was provided by a 3rd party seller and was NOT the item this review links to on Amazon.
4,good,this is a good cd. but what do you expect from stevie wonder. the disc was in good condition but it did seem like it took forever to get it. other than that its a great purchase.
5,A great Stevie Wonder best of!!!,This great double album(now 2CD's!!!)is a great sampling of Stevie's greatest seveneties hits!!! 16 classics!!! Awesome!!! Five Stars!!! A+!!! Essential!!!
1,Butchered in remastering.,"If you love Stevie Wonder's music, you owe it to yourself to hunt-down a non-remastered version of these collections. I had the earlier versions, and lost one of the discs, so came back to Amazon to buy it again, and ordered this, thinking ""hmm, remastered, and both discs in the same package"" ...Big disappointment. It sounds compressed and equalized excessively, it's harshly brighter, more distorted sounding and overall unpleasant to listen to. Also, the level of the analog tape hiss is notably hotter than on my ""old"" version! Certainly compressing and EQ'ing old masters can effectively raise the level of hiss, but this seems like more than what I would expect from that and I can't figure why. I almost wonder if this remastering was mistakenly done from an analog copy of the original master tapes (which is not unheard of). Regardless, it just plain sounds wrong.Save yourself a minor heartache.. If the non-remastered versions are no longer available, buy used."
5,Wonder Hits,"Original Musaquarium I is a greatest hits album that spans the most fruitful period of Stevie Wonder's career, 1972-1980. The album does not leave out any of the hits from that era. You get ""Higher Ground"", ""Superstition"", ""Master Blaster"", ""Isn't She Lovely"", ""I Wish"", ""Sir Duke"" among others. If you already own these songs on other releases, there is a bonus of four new songs. ""Front Line"" has a rock edge to it and is a stinging condemnation of the treatment of Vietnam vets, ""Ribbon In The Sky"" is a classic Wonder love song, ""Do I Do"" spans twelve minutes and shows off a jazzy side and ""That Girl"" shows off his vocal prowess and has some great harmonica playing. Many people are considered musical geniuses, but only a few actually are. Stevie Wonder is one of the few."
5,Essential Stevie Wonder,"Stevie Wonder's ""Original Musiquarium I"" goes beyond the traditional greatest hits package by offering 16 songs of rhythmic unity. A few tracks - notably ""Isn't She Lovely"" and ""Do I Do"" - are uncut versions that never reached the Top 40 airwaves. ""Superstition,"" ""Boogie On Reggae Woman,"" ""Master Blaster (Jammin')"" and ""Sir Duke"" remain essentials in this timeless collection."
5,"It's the best, don't bother with any other.",This Wax is the finest I have ever worked with in 40 years of detail Motorcycles and Autos. If better exists I haven't found it yet!
5,Awesome,My husband purchased this here since we could not find it locally. He knew it would help put a beautiful shine on my 1999 Miata.
1,unhappy,Wax was so thin that it ran out of the cans during transit and wasunuseable when I received it. Not a good product at all
1,Not Pure,"This is not pure carnauba wax. It contains petroleum distillates. Made what I needed this for take a lot longer. The distillates can be somewhat evaporated by letting it sit out uncovered, but it takes a very long time."
1,Crappy Carnauba Wax!,"This So-called Pure Carnauba Wax is Crap! 1st this Wax has Petroleum Distillates in it? A High Quality Pure Carnauba Wax, Does Not Have Petroleum in it! 2nd it's difficult to remove! 3rd it doesn't leave a slick slippery finish at All! 4th The shine is nothing to write home about! So I returned this crappy wax, which in it self was a waste of money and time! I'm going back to one of the Best Carnauba paste waxes out there for the money, and that is ""Blitz Carnauba paste wax!"" Blitz Wax blows Mudders wax away! Heck, Black Magic's wet shine liquid wax blows mudders away!!"
2,I was hoping to see something fresher,I was hoping to see something fresher from Pottery Barn. This is just a continuation of what we find in their catalog pictures.
1,waste of money,"What a waste of money this was. I compared it to the new HGTV Before and After Decorating book I bought at the same time, and I'm sorry I bought this. The photos in this book are what you would expect from Pottery Barn. They are stylish but nothing very new or different and there isn't much information to help me with my own living room. In contrast, the HGTV book has one interesting before and after makeover after another supplemented with lots of information tohelp me redo my own rooms. If you like the pottery barn look, I think you can just get their catalogs and get the same feeling for free instead of buying the pottery barn book."
4,Really nice,Saw this book for the first time the other day and just had to get it. I've enjoyed it so much. There are lovely ideas and beautiful photographs. I highly recommend.
4,"Beautiful, Interesting and Helpful.","I am rather insecure when it comes to interior design, yet I have the desire to have a beautiful home on a budget. This book helped me not only identify a color palate for my living room, but gave me ideas to easily change the look for the change of seasons. It helped my husband and I create our own casual, yet polished look that we are proud to call home!"
4,A Good book for living room design Ideas,"I really have enjoyed this book. Though I have not found every page useful, there are enough ideas to make it worth the purchase. The chapters cover many important design aspects in a living room: your style, space, color, texture, furnishings, lighting, windows, storage, accessories and display. Be aware that it is naturally focused to the Pottery Barn style of decorating - which can be somewhat generic. But there are enough inspirational ideas that you can interpret and make them work for you whether you shop at Pottery Barn or not."
5,Living Rooms,"With the purchase of our home several months ago, I've been thinking about what to do with our living room - how should I spruce it up and give an updated look without spending tons of money. Not wanting to rush into things, I've looked through many books and magazines, mulling many ideas from paint colors, furniture, how to decorate walls, should the room have a certain theme, etc. While many of the books and magazines had great ideas, none of the ideas felt just right. And then I came upon the Pottery Barn Living Rooms book. WOW! The 'look' that I'd been searching for was now laid out in perfect fashion. This book has helped me to pick colors (for walls and window treatments) and has helped me decorate with things (pictures, vases, etc) that I already had but thought they were outdated and out of style. I love this book. This book has pointed me in the right direction and though I'm still not finished decorating, I have much more of an idea of what I want to do."
1,preaching to the choir,"There is nothing to review because since I bought this item on September 27th 2006, I have not received it. Please if you are unable to deliver what I purchased, bring my money back.Ernest Mashabe"
4,A lot like The Gospel,"If you liked The Gospel then you will probably like this movie also! The two movies are almost identical there are very few differences. But, I still think it is a very good movie!"
3,Feedback from this as a gift,"I gave this to my mother-in-law who is very spirit-filled and loves movies about the church. However, she was underwhelmed with the story and production value; she felt it ""needed something""."
2,Should have been a rental,"I was disappointed after the first 30 minutes and realized this was a bad knock off between ""The Gospel"" and ""The Fighting Temptations"". I would not recommend purchasing. You are better off renting."
3,"Not exactly a Christian movie, but still pretty good.","This movie doesn't know whether it wants to be a Christian movie or secular movie. From just looking at the cover, I thought I was getting a nice Christian movie, but the amount of profanity and sexual innuendo made it clear to me that I was mistaken. That having been said, the movie was still pretty good. I don't see how a movie like this can make any money though. The Christian theme would offend the sinners and the cursing and sex talk would offend the Christians - especially the deep ones. If this movie is trying to pass as a Christian movie, it failed the test. It does have a happy ending but the movie has no real redeeming value. It doesn't attempt to present the Gospel message in any way shape or form. If you're looking for a pure Christian movie, maybe you should skip this one, but if you want to be entertained and don't mind a few curse words here and there, this would be a pretty good one to watch."
4,Objective Observer,This movie was surprisingly fresh. You could feel the energy in all of the songs. Eartha Kitt was fantastic as was most of the cast. I gave it 4 stars only because it sort of resembled the Gospel. Great movie for the family.
4,Great book for beginning to intermediate builders,Perfect if you are a beginner or intermediate builder. Great photos help clarify ideas and direction.
5,Everything you need to build a shed besides materials & labor...,Great guide which actually teaches you the concepts of DIY construction. It is a big book with beautiful pictures and LOTS of information. Now all I have to do is put it in effect before my wife kills me! ;o)
4,The only book you will need,"Having ordered 3 books on sheds based on the on-line reviews, this book along with Barns, Sheds and Outbuildings: Plan, Design, Build (Ultimate Guide To... [Paperback] The Ultimate Guide to Yard and Garden Sheds: Plan, Design, Build.... this is the only book you will need. The other two, while they show up under, ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought..."" pale in comparison to the information contained in this book. In addition, the two I listed above are almost identical in content, same photos, diagrams etc. I have reviewed a couple of other offerings while at Home Depot and Lowes and while they may be good for ideas on style this book is all you need for construction. Enjoy it."
3,Lots of good tips inside,"After reading through this book, I had the confidence to build my own 10 by 10 outdoor shed.This book does not contain blueprints for building sheds form start to finish. However, it does have a lot of pictures and informative tips to get you started. Often times I was able to simply look at the pictures to see how they did things.It contains good step-by-step instructions for setting up various types of bases, and the section on roofing really helped me out.Overall, I would recommend it if you need some ideas or some tips on how to get started or what to watch out for."
2,No Detailed Plans Provided,"This book is mostly inspiration with pictures of different shed types. There is some mediocre discussion for foundation types. However, there are no detailed plans for building anything in this book. Instead, they give you web links for where you can buy the plans, going from around $30 - $50. The plans themselves then contain customized features requiring you to buy certain products (such as the windows) from the same outfit that sold you the plans.This book is not much more than marketing material to get you to spend your money at specific vendors. They should give away this book for free at places like Lowes. Pretty pictures, but there are better books to buy on shed building."
1,Beware!!,"After a couple of weeks, the battery lid latch, which is a tiny piece of plastic broke. Soldering iron and some careful melting got it where it would latch. After a few weeks it started eating batteries like a hungry shark. Even the high amp batteries would only take about 10 pictures and then the camera would no longer turn on. Blurry pictures are a norm. Just an expensive piece of junk. BEWARE! Don't even bother buying used."
1,Not a good camera,"I bought this camera on sale about 2 years ago. It worked great for about 8 months, then it would not take a clear photo. Nearly ever picture I took was blurry. Soon after that problem, the camera would shut down a few seconds after turning it on. I regret ever buying this camera. I am planning to buy a Canon."
3,cool,"This camera was affordable and was delivered quickly. I had to keep the USB cord from my old camera in order to upload pictures and the battery latch doesn't always close all the way. Overall, though, it is a great camera that gets the job done."
4,Good Job,"Sfat Emet is an incredibly succinct and somewhat enigmatic work. There are portions that are so cryptic that one must read them several times in order to absorb their full meaning. Accordingly, Prof. Green's elucidation can be quite helpful. Furthermore, while Prof. Green taps into the universalism inherent in Sfat Emet, he is generally moderate in his interpretation of the Rebbe's work. As a result, he very rarely offends the sensibilities of the more traditional reader (i.e., one that might refer to ""the Sfas Emes""). Finally, the historical information is good reading."
4,Way Overpriced,"I love this book and the rest in the series. But I live in St.Kitts in the West Indies and purchased the book for $30 EC dollars about $11.00 US. I was only searching because I missed on in the series. Your price is RIDICULOUS, try the publisher."
3,Remembering Children's Community Workshop,"My daughter Marisa was Michael Edmonds' ""partner in crime"" in those days. They gave us many heartstopping moments. Wish we knew where Michael ended up....Marisa and her kids were thrilled to see it. The authors had promised her a copy back then, but things were very laid back and iffy in those days of wine, roses, and going with the flow. A memoir of those days for all of us. Some nice b/w shots."
2,Outdated,"The idea of the book is awesome, but given that it was published about 10 years ago, this book is incredibly outdated with attractions in Buffalo, Bus Routes, etc; however, the author does give an indication that since he no longer lives in Buffalo, he has no intentions of updating it himself. As a current resident of Buffalo, I would be willing to update it, but it probably belongs on a more fluid media, such as a website, rather than a printed version, so that it can be changed when necessary."
1,"Overpriced, average quality, poor function","Pretty to look at, but certainly not worth the quoted ""list"" price. Thankfully, I bought it on an Amazon Friday 'sale' and didn't waste too much money on it. The construction is good, but function is mediocre at best. Nozzles have limited range of motion and with the installed flow restrictor it basically dribbles water on you. You can remove the flow restrictor to get more force to the shower, but will empty your hot water tank in short order. Have de-installed it already and installed a Water Pic that has much better force through its nozzles and uses far less water to achieve it. When I get ready to sell my house, I'll re-install it and take the Water Pic with me. I'm sure the new owners will also quickly switch it out, too. Felt ripped off by Amazon with the extremely high ""list"" price quoted - thought I was getting a deal on a high quality item, but it wasn't worth the $70 I paid for it. Caveat Emptor!"
3,Triple-Cylinder Showerhead,It is OK. I do believe that it would help if the exstention from the wall was a few inches longer. And the adjustablity would be a farther range of motion.
5,hands up!!,a very good album from Astarte.I am supprized at how long that I waited to get this release. but when I sawit on amazon. I liked what I heard. that and the price was in my budget. thanks amazon.
4,Great Team Up Album!,"I am a big fan of Bob James. I have other of his collaboration albums and group albums such as FOURPLAY and find this album to be one of his best collaborative efforts. This album is great as background music at a social function or just to listen to while relaxing.The album starts out great with ""Movin' On"" and keeps the pace up throughout the entire album. The transitions from selection to selection are smooth and have no jarring shifts from mellow selections to upbeat selections. Even songs like ""New York Samba"" with it's slightly busy and upbeat tempo blends in with the other selections.If you like modern jazz I doubt you can go wrong with this instrumental jazz purchase."
1,Good product if you're into disposable goods,"Battery does not charge up to full capacity after a year of use. When I first bought this item I could edge my entire front and back lawn then use the blower to clean up after mowing. Now I can't even complete the edge trim on the back yard before the battery runs out of power. Impossible to find replacement battery. If you're into disposable diapers and throw away butane lighters, then you'll love the disposable lawn trimmer, because once this dog's battery ceases to hold a worthwhile charge it becomes an expensive door stop!"
2,Same battery problems as everyone else,"I have experienced the battery problems too. After two seasons I can't even edge my small, urban front lawn (the whole property if 60 feet wide so there's really not much edging to do) on one charge."
2,Not a fun project,"The book about bookmaking looks good. The sewing of the binding went well -- but why do they have you to mix your own glue??? They should provide pre-mixed glue. It's frustrating and impossible to get the lumps out. Then when you put the book down to dry on newspaper, the newspaper gets stuck to the book. The end paper instructions are hard to follow. We're still working on this project, but I really wish I were through!"
4,great!! FOR KIDS,"i don't know what i missed but i was looking for an adult book kit and received this. it is very cute , easy to assemble and they also encourage you to finish it by filling it in with anything you fancy making it your real first book.very nice for kids 5-8 i would guess"
4,"""Souls"" of Darkness","The soundtrack to the chilling supernatural thriller,""Lost Souls"", was one of the most unexpected things ever to come along in my CD collection. The composer utilizes many soft subdued melodies that ache with loneliness and melancholy, especially in the tracks for the ""Main Title"" and ""Maya"". He is also able to hint at the darker terrors of the unknown, using dark religious music and choir. The tracks ""The Pentacle"", ""The Bridge"", ""Satan's Church"", and ""Last Ride"" all all examples of the more dramatic moments. Overall this score yeilded a delightful surprise, full of excellent music: sad, haunting, scary, and exciting. It is a perfect complement to the creey, chilling film itself, and is one that collectors of horror film soundtracks and religious music should definitely check out."
5,Classic!! Rocks,"This book is so much better than the Schaum's outline or problem book series. If working on routine repetitive problems are you hobby then there is nothing I can say about. But if you want to learn through working on problems--interesting and typical problems, this book is for you. Analytic Geometry is an old subject and high school math doesn't emphasize enough. For those ambitious students or high school teachers, it's a valuable contribution."
4,"Nice Table, But It's Not White!","This arrived in perfect condition and within 4 days of order. I bought white chairs with arms at Home Depot to go with the table. Picture the chairs sitting on the grass waiting for the table to arrive. Then, picture my surprise when I opened the box and pulled out a --- not white --- but ivory colored table to the point where it almost looks yellow. With a white house and white vinyl fence, this would not be my first choice. Fortunately, I found some ivory colored chairs at Walmart that match the table, although they're not as comfortable or as nice as the white ones from Home Depot. I will keep the table because it's very nice, but it would have been even nicer to get it in white (as described)."
2,Cliches fatally wound this Western.,"T.D Allen's ""Ambush at Buffalo Wallow"" was originally written in the fifties. It tells the story of a U.S Army Scout named Billy Colt, and this one is laden with cliches. Let me count them off: Colt is a ""street-smart"" soldier with a ""book-smart"" know-nothing commanding officer; Colt's wife has been kidnapped by hostile Indians, and Colt has to break the rules in order to set up a small band to rescue her; a young and brash Indian(who are quite 2-dimensional) wants to have her and he goes after Colt; there's a traitor that happens to be in the rescue party, but he ends up in the same boat as the others; said traitor redeems himself(the old bad boy gone good routine). I do like the character of Amity Colt, but this is way too cliched and overdone to be a good book."
5,This album is ALL TERRY..A MUST have for any music fan!!,"""How I Feel"" is the third album for this beautiful Country Music artist, and her best by far!! With this CD Terri steps out of the box running ~ showcasing herself as an artist, a vocalist and a songwriter. Each cut is better than the one before. While the album as a whole is true country, it is different from Terri's other two albums. It has a romantic feel to it ~ Listeners will no doubt be able to relate to these songs, The first cut on the CD is ""I'm Alright"" ~ Which describes this CD and artist exceptionally! If you are a Terri Clark fan, a country Music fan, or just want to hear a girl belt out some terrific songs, this is the CD for you! You will not be disappointed!!"
4,No Tiger in sight...,I placed my order April 12th; it is now May 9th and Amazon says my estimated ship date is May 5th (free shipping of course) also I don't see the reference to the $50 coupon for the 5 user version - the coupon requires order placement (not shipping) before 5/31 so I bet all more profitable orders will go out first... I'm not in a rush but this (shipping delay) is still frustrating.
5,THIS THING OWNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just got this. It is so easy to install. AND I AM ONLY 14!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHHI have installed it on my friend's comp, mine, dad's, mom's, and sistersso many good features BUY IT!!!i like the dashboard feature wait till i show off at school with it :P on my nice 1.67 ghz powerbook that runs Tiger faster than Panther"
1,ordered april 29th-still no spoftware,How can Amazon claim immediate shipping when I have been waiting 2 weeks?
4,Interesting point of view,"If the author believes one's ""last check written should be to the undertaker, and it should bounce!"" this is the way to do it. I think it's irresponsible to instruct people to spend what they make, but not overstep into debt. Yes, enjoy your hard earned money, give it away if you like when you are alive, but don't think for a minute you won't run out of resources before your last breath if you follow this book. Things I like about this book: I do like the notion of NOT retiring. I think people are ""retiring"" at an alarming rate in the prime of their productive lives, and for what? Also the idea of spending cash instead of using credit is excellent advice for the instant-gratification age we are in."
3,"Some good ideas, but . . . should be marked READ WITH CARE","My contention is that if I get one good idea out of a self-help book, it's time well spent. I got one good idea. QED. BUT . . . Ethically, I also have a problem with his advice to treat every job you have as nothing more than a way to make money. His illustrations are almost all of highly educated New Yorkers making 6-figure incomes, who started fairly young and have lots of time to follow his advice. Which is essentially: stay out of debt; pay attention to how much you actually spend; don't sell yourself short in terms of your ability to bring in $. His advice on reverse mortgages, annuities and insurance are good counterweight to much of the received wisdom . . . but if you use this as your only source of advice, you are likely to find yourself in deep trouble. Fast."
1,critical of books content,"after reading this book i believe that mr pollan wants us to ""die on the job"".if you invest wisely you can retire early, lets say at age 52.if you lived frugal then retire frugal."
2,"An interesting viewpoint, but...","Pollan and Levine put foward a radical approach to life. Such a different viewpoint is valuable if only to make one think ""out of the box"". However, my faith in the authors was severely shaken when I read a serious error in their advice. They state that non-cash gifts are not subject to Federal Gift Taxes. This is definitely incorrect. (Check IRS form 709 and the accompanying instructions, which states very clearly that transfer of any type of property, real or personal, including cash, is subject to gift taxes.) Makes me think---what other errors might be there that I didn't catch. My advice--read with a grain of salt."
2,Not a good investment of spare time,"The book is obviously aimed towards the baby-boom generation as a motivational tool. About half of the content is devoted to the philosophy of Dying Broke (garnered from the cover in minutes) and the rest of the content vaguely describes approaches to car purchases, insurance, mortgages etc... I would not recommend the purchase of this book to friends."
1,A great book....if you make 100K a year,"This book should offer a disclaimer: Don't buy unless you are already rich. Assumes that you are already well paid and have a ton of money to invest in this ""radical plan"". I can think of at least a half dozen more helpful, constructive personal finance books that aren't as patronizing or condescending as this one. Not a book for the beginning or small investor. Depressing if you are looking for simple, practical advice."
4,Practical guide to what was always intuitive,"The two concepts that solidified it for me is that inheritance is BAD and only corrupts your children, and second, eventhough you pay off your plastic each month, it is still much more beneficial (thrifty) to use cash and make it painful. I am impressed by the resource data and sources of validation. A great book if taken with a little salt."
3,Nothing really surprising,"I guess that I gravitated to this title because it supported my personal beliefs already. While I share the feelings of another reviewer that the critique of ""Debit/ATM"" cards is inconsistent, the overall philosophy is sound. However, there is nothing really earth shattering for a person who has already reviewd her/his life and choices. If you are ""following the crowd"" in your money choices, this book will probably help. If you have already decided to ""Quit"" your job, give ip the idea of ""retirement,"" and not leave an inheritance (Being of sound mind and body...I spent it all) you probably know more than the author."
1,Typical Baby Boomer Claptrap,"The authors attempt to justify blowing all your money on yourself, leaving your children penniless, and clogging up the work place until you are so old they have to wheel you away from your desk on a stretcher. It is pretty ironic considering the unprecedented economic advantages given to the Baby Boom generation by their parents, who generally did exactly the opposite of what this book says is okay for Boomers to do. Utterly predictable, self-absorbed advice for the Me Generation.The only good advice in here is to cut up your credit cards. But anyone with a brain figured that one out a long time ago.If you are a Baby Boomer looking for a pat on the back for leaving your kids high and dry or treading water in a job that should have went to a younger person 15 years ago, then buy this book, you'll feel better about your actions. If you are anyone else, leave this one on the shelf."
3,Targeted at big-earner/poor-saver.,"The latter half is a useful encyclopedia of financial information, but Die Broke is a losing plan.Die Broke is a thought-provoking read, but its thesis should be taken with a large grain of salt. This plan is mostly useful if you are incapable of saving effectively, or you've started too late. It's written for the undisciplined high-earner.Frugality is always a good idea. Maximizing your income is a good idea. Dodging estate tax by gifting is a good idea. But none of these are new ideas. They don't change the fact that to become wealthy and live the good life, you need to spend less than you take in, invest the income wisely, and generate as much income in the first place as possible.The book contains some useful easy-to-accesss reference information (though it isn't really high quality), but no great insight, despite the author's claims about his ""revolutionary"" ideas."
2,baby boomer selfishness shines through.,"This book is, it seems to me, a view of one who is selfish and concerned only with himself - maybe typical of the baby boomer generation. No matter that one of his children or grandchildren may suffer from a life threatining illness that may wipe out family savings, the author recommends that one live a life without carefully planning, and ignores the fact that individuals themself or those they love may need to save in order to plan and help the one's they love in those times of need. While an individual with all the money in the world may, although doubtful, live a life of complete content, one would think that his or her love for others would encourage he or she not to spend as the author, but save and live a more humble, and likely more pleaseing life, so that that individual may not have to suffer needlessly."
1,Skip This Book And Its Bad Advice,"This book has little useful advice unless you want absolution for lack of planning for your retirement. The authors' silly premise is that retirement is an outmoded idea invented during the depression to chase older workers from the labor pool. Save your money and buy a book that helps you reach your retirement goals, rather than one that preaches working into your eighties, and screwing your undertaker with your last bad check."
4,"Good ideas, short on detail","If it does nothing else, this book at least presents some alternatives to the idea that the goal in ones life should be to accumulate wealth so that at a certain age one never need to work again. The author touches upon almost every financial aspect of a person's life, from the use of credit cards to getting an automobile. I do not personally agree with every idea that he presents, but I do like the general spirit with which he writes.My main complaint is that it does not go into as much detail as I would have liked, but it is really a minor complaint since its main value is in the ideas, and one can find out the details from other sources."
2,Spongebob going downhill,"With the exception of the splinter, Giant squidward, and Life in the day, these episodes are either not really funny or they are terrible. The big one was possibly the worst episode that I have ever seen in Spongebob, even though I'm a big fan. Please, don't buy this."
3,Baptism,"I love Lenny Kravitz. I was a little disappointed at this album. I really didn't like it as much as I wanted to, although I still listen to it alot, but I end up skipping tracks. My favorite tracks are; 1, 6, 7, 9 and maybe 10. I think most of his slow songs have too much of the same melody. I think Lenny tried too hard for this album, it's not as good as it should be. I think it's time for Lenny to retire in the music industry. His best work in my opinion were albums like ""5"", ""Circus"" and ""Let Love Rule""."
3,Solid Lenny Kravitz,I enjoyed this CD. I thought that the musicianship was solid and so was the writing.My favorites on this CD are: Where are we runnin' and Minister of Rock 'n Roll.Um... did anyone think that Lenny's voice sounded sort of Ozzy Osbourne-ish on Minister of Rock 'n Roll?
2,"Nothing new, or interesting","I would consider myself a big Kravitz fan, seen him twice and own all the albums. However Baptism is hardly an improvement from the last album Lenny. It is mostly rock rooted, but the songs have nothing that really get you. I also wonder why Lenny is now insistant on playing all the instruments, when all the fans know that his live band is one of the best in the business. I think these songs would have more punch with Ross on lead guitar and Blackmann on drums. Instead Lenny pounds us with drums that don't really sound any different from Lenny and guitars that sound like they were recorded with the amplifier buried in a tin drum. I think Lenny Kravitz really needs to reconsider how and who he uses to record new material."
1,utterly dissapointed,"lenny continues to dissapoint. I'm a huge lenny fan, seen him 3 times live. last year he cancelled his denver show two hours before it began citing throat problems. He cancelled several shows with this excuse on that tour and it was widely talked about that it was ticket sales not his throat that caused the cancellations. he promised to come back in the fall but it never happened. This cd has no direction and no feel. I I think he's gotten to big for his britches and has began to take his fans and his own talent for granted. Try the new Prince cd!!"
1,Rebirth?,"If so, maybe Rock'n'roll should be dead! This is the most disappointing collaboration from this very talented musician. I was a fan before he became a commercial success with the album 5, and I must say that there is nothing on this album worth listening to. Even my 7 year old daughter, who knows every Lenny song to date, said, ""Mom, is this Lenny? This is a bad CD!"""
3,Packaging is everything,"Many people compare Lenny to Hendrix. This is severely wrong...he's got more in common with Eddie Grant since he's been rewriting ""Electric Avenue"" for the last decade."
4,What's with the Hendrix comparisons?,"Baptism is an excellent effort. No, not goundbreaking but good solid rock. Sure it's been done before, but really good rock is still hard to find. Why the Hendrix comparisons? It doesn't make any sense. Hendrix was a virtuoso way ahead of his time. Kravitz has always been retro - ON PURPOSE - and he does it better than anyone. He practically channels the 70's rock/funk groove. If you want it authentic, buy the Sly and the Family Stone catalog. If you want guitar supremacy, buy Hendrix. If you want a fan's love letter to both, buy Baptism"
1,copy controlled - no warning,Amazon doesn't inform you that this CD is copy controlled so you won't be able to add it your mp3 library - nor ipod etc. Buy the songs online instead.
3,Hoped for more,"This is coming from a dedicated Lenny fan who's seen him live twice and was changed forever. I was really looking forward to this album. Like everyone else has said below, ""Baptism"" is somewhat better than ""Lenny"" but I totally expected more. I was really digging where Lenny was going with ""5"" with neo-funk rock songs like ""Super Soul Fighter."" But his last two albums have been more like straight ahead rock, at times sounding simplistic as Kiss, but with better vocals.Don't get me wrong, it is good with songs like ""Minister..."" and a couple of soulful ballads with good sax solos. I just think that Lenny is capable of so much more."
2,We lost him since 2001 and this album does not redeem him,"I had hopes, I must admit. I really wanted Lenny Kravitz to rediscover deep inside him that long lost feel that he captured us with back in the days of his first few albums, all the way to the grand '5' from 1999. But so life goes... After his 2000 Greatest Hits release it all went downhill, and 'Baptism' is not doing much to redeem him from his sin: to deprive music lovers of the world from the great music he's capable of. I honestly don't give the album one star, because all creative efforts entail enough work to be worth something, but there's so much more potential in Lenny that I can only be dissapointed at this album. Quite simply, don't buy it!"
4,Worth Buying,"I must say that i am a big Lenny Kravitz fan.When i first listened to it i didn't like it much bu then by time you'll like it a lot. I cant stay without i absolutely love it. Baptism is a good album and i think that it is one of his best albums. ""Minister of Rock n Roll"", ""Where are we Runnin"", ""Storm"" and ""Baptized"" are very good songs. The other songs are also good songs. I believe that Lenny has done a good job here, as he always writes songs depending on what he is passing through, and that is nice. Lenny has a great voice and no one must discuss that he is also one of the most talented musicians now a days. This album should be in everyones collection of CDs. Personally i still prefer 5 but Lenny still did not let me down here, the more i hear it the more i like it. Its either cause i like Lenny or cause he is a great singer and musician. The choice is up to you."
3,3 Stars because its Lenny...,"But come on! Seriously! ""Lady""??? That song is the most cliche, unoriginal songs I have ever heard. It doesn't hold a candle to ""Fly Away"". ""Fly Away"" has captivated me since I was young. That song was the reason I got into Lenny at all. Now, I have to listen to ""Lady"" at least 20,000,000 times at wrok EVERY DAY. I hate that song with a passion!"
4,I agree with TJ....,"I LOVED the Glorious CD as well, but I was also hugely disappointed that the parts I liked best on the Dress to Kill Video were not on the CD. How on earth could they have left out Engelbert Humperdink and the ""do you have a flag?"" segment, the two most hilarious and memorable parts of the video???Regardless of the large omissions on the Dress to Kill CD, both of these are absolutely must-owns for any Eddie Izzard fan. They are especially great for long trips in the car and make the time just fly by. The price is also excellent and actually these are cheaper to get via amazon than they were when I was over in Europe at some of the chain music stores there.So run don't walk (well, type don't walk would be more appropriate here) all Eddie Izzard fans and buy these CDs!!"
4,Beyond Groovy,"If you want to laugh, & I mean really laugh you have to purchase this cd. Of course, this is not the spoon fed comedy you find with today ""up and coming"" ""comics"". I did have to take it home from the office - found myself spending too much time listening, and well you know the rest."
4,Packaging,"The box broke as soon as I opened it, but the disk had no scratches. I had to buy a new box, but thank you for the nice note and the DVD!"
1,Good ole american racism at it's finest,"Guess the title was not enough of a hilarious racist piece of trash. The movie though part of american history Cartoon Craze Presents: Casper & Friends ""Spooking about Africa"" This is racism at it's finest. In case you do not know Spooks is a racist name for black people. Now lets go on though not too much further because I do not want to waste my time you will find really really really black jungle people and overt racisim. Not one for the kiddies!"
4,"""Dude"" is Alright!",The Dude Abides provided the order faster than I had imagined and product description was spot on. I would do business with him again.Thanks!
5,A Delightful Story,"Martha Morse is a lively lass, too lively to be laird's daughter. Her Mother, Grisie, and herself wait for Father to come, with a enchanting secret they can't wait to find out! Her relatives are moving to Fairlie, and Martha is bursting with excitement. Cousin Mary and Rachel, the youngest of the cousins, comes to stay with Martha and Nannie and Mollie and Cook and Father, while their home in Fairlie is remodeled. If you are a Martha fan or you liked Little House in the Highlands, you will most definitely like the second book in the Martha Years, The Far Side of the loch."
1,NOT THE REAL THING,"This edition is severely abridged. Don't waste your time. Get the whole story (which is really no more difficult to read - just longer and better and with all the effort and details the author intended, not a hacked and chopped version she doesn't even like - she left the publisher and stopped writing the series' because of their decision....)"
4,McCarver's Character Comes Through,"Tim McCarver has become an icon in the world of baseball announcing. His commentary during games is exceptional for combining the experience of a former ballplayer with a sharp wit, a fierce intelligence, and strongly held opinions. His style and personality comes through in ""Oh Baby, I Love It,"" even though the book was written near the beginning of his announcing career. I could easily hear McCarver's voice as I read.The book loses momentum when McCarver is simply reporting events, such as the Mets' entire 1986 season. McCarver is at his best when writing about his viewpoints and the stars he played with."
2,Full Of Hot Air,The overrated George C. Scott heads a cast of wooden actors through a thin plot built around the famed zeppelin. A laborious and meaningless flight has the audience waiting for the historic climax that could otherwise be seen acurately at your local library. Wait for a film with a thoughtful and proper leaning perspective on this unique airship.
3,"Good product, rapidly delivered.","The seller was fine. The actual movie only so so,but the dvd was as promised."
3,Hindenburg Review,"My sister and I watched this movie together about 20 years ago when we were kids. George C. Scott gives a good performance, although we did get a good laugh out of the General trying to hang on as the Hindenburgh crashes to the earth."
5,Disaster in the Sky,"A good movie, it won an award for best special effects, historically correct too. The part I did not like was the ending. We ALL know that the Hindenburg burst into flames while landing on lakehurst N.J., the problem in the movie is that when it explodes it takes way to long for the Great Symbol of Nazi Power to come down (it only took 34 seconds for the ship to come down in real like). George C. Scott and Bancraft (The Graduate and Ants) work well together, I hope they make a remake to this classic."
4,Where is the Blu-Ray edition?,"Why is this movie not available in Blu-Ray? The DVD is only standard definition 480i. If a Blu-Ray edition is not to be made available please at least update the DVD to ""anamorphic"", ""enhanced for widescreen tv"" so that it can be played on an upscaling DVD player to ""near 1080p"" in it's proper widescreen format without having to make adjustments to DVD and/or TV settings. Yes, the movie is mostly fiction with the true story of ""The Hindenburg"" only as a backdrop, but I do find it entertaining and George C. Scott is always good."
1,The Hindenburg,"The Hindenburg Widescreen DVDThe picture quality is not bad, it is TERRIBLE! How can a such a poor quality film be released? I would send it back, but Amazon will only give you 50% of the purchase price if opened. Live and learn and take the loss."
3,"Interesting Story, Unlikely Plot","George C. Scott turns in a good performance in this story about the dirigible that blew up in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The film indicates that the Hindenburg was the victim of sabotage, but I find that view unconvincing. The dirigible's balloon was filled with highly flammable hydrogen. It was raining that day, and there was electricity and lightning in the air. It does not take a rocket scientist to conclude that the airship was a disaster waiting to happen. One thing is certain: had the bag been filled with helium, there would have no explosion."
4,"An excellent disaster movie, NOT a disastrous movie!","Critics simply didnt favour this film, main points of contention being the soap-opera style acting, variable special effects, and an overdrawn and therefore anticlimactic conclusion. Certainly there is some truth in the first of these criticisms, and its puzzling why Robert Wise allowed or even encouraged it. Yet I do not feel the film sinks as a result, notably due to George C. Scotts rock solid (as usual) performance. There are a handful of actors who carry a film, or seem incapable of giving a below- par performance, Mr. Scott falls into both these categories. This is not to say he is the only reason for watching, far from it. The music score is impressive, the Oscar-winning special effects fine and probably deserving of this acolade, and the tragic finale harrowing, moving, and therefore very effective. Not a classic, but severely underrated, this film only just fails to hit my Top Twenty all-time favourite movies."
3,Technically excellent but the story is pretty pro-forma,"The best aspect of this film is the cinematography--the viewer truly gets the feeling that he or she is cruising across the Atlantic on the Hindenburg. That is no small feat, and this film pulls it off brilliantly. Unfortunately, the storyline does not live up to the special effects. George C. Scott competently portrays a German Luftwaffe intelligence officer assigned to prevent sabotage to the Hindenburg, as it makes a cruise between Nazi Germany (1937) and New Jersey. In actuality no one has ever proven the cause of the famous explosion that destroyed the Hindenburg, but this film's story involves sabotage. Other than Scott, the characters never really come alive, and the storyline plods along to its pre-ordained conclusion. This is a watchable film, but probably not one that many viewers will watch more than once. RJB."
3,Hindenburg is more than just a lot of hot air at 3 1/2 stars,"I enjoyed this film for it's historical details, groundbreaking special effects for its time (and they still hold up today), nice intercutting of the real explosive footage of the Hindenburg with studio creations, and terrific acting by George C. Scott (always reliable), William Atherton who made a career out of playing bad or generally sleezy guys (see him in Die Hard 1 and 2), and Roy Thinnes (a great TV actor who never got enough credit on the big screen). The great cast of other familiar faces all do a competent job. Less storylines and melodrama than most in this genre and it was a welcome change.This film is definitely worth renting/viewing. Purchase it only if you are into these kinds of historical disaster films."
2,The Hindenbomb,"If you're expecting a (real-life based) disaster movie full of thrills and suspense, forget it. This pic is a great big lead balloon. Directed by Robert Wise (""The Sound of Music"". ""West Side Story"", ""I Want to Live"") we could have hoped for more. Someone should chop off the screenwriter's hand as this is deadeningly boring. Even the great George C. Scott and Anne Bancroft cannot breathe life into soap opera cardboard cutout characters, desite ther talent and charisma. A wonderful supporting cast including the always excellent Burgess Meredith and also William Atherton, Richard Dysart and others make little impression in thankless roles. This interminable turkey would have been better if the dirigible had burst into flames during the opening credits, along with the script."
4,Great Sound/Lousy DVD player,"A friend bought this for me for my birthday, and what a great gift it was.The perfect home theatre sound system for an apartment. Plus the speakers are small enoughto sit on counter tops, shelves and smallish places (you don't needto use the stands if you don't have room). The many ""Sound"" optionsare fun also. The only problem I have with this system is the DVD player.It's a mess. It's very slow. The instructions for the remote (which by the way is pretty confusing) keep telling you of everything it can do,without really telling you how. SO it's hit or miss. Plus the designfor the remote is pretty badly set up also. Not very user friendly.It also says that it is PAL readable. Not!! The instructions on how toget it to play PAL do not work.So in a nutshell...This system is very good, but would be better withoutthe DVD player. I'm going to see if I can't sell this player and get myself a single disk region free player."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I have a 2005 Ford Ranger. It does truck work and is not babied. However, I do keep it maintained so I can get as many years out of it as possible. Once a year I give it a thorough wash and wax before winter. Thought I would go the extra mile this year with the clay bar system. I was very disappointed that it did not remove even water stains. I ended up using some Maguires Scratch-X that I had to get the stains off. It might work great on a vehicle that is waxed more often but did not do what I wanted."
5,Rocks,This stuff rocks. Got off overspray on my custom motorcycle. Also works on powdercoat. I can't recommend this stuff enough. Buy it!
5,MOTHERS CLAY BAR,"I live in Florida and direct sun always on vehicle. I have tried other cleaners and polishes, nothing worked as well as Mother's Clay Bar. After repeated washings, still looks great and surface is as smooth a balloon. I liked it so much that I ordered two more boxes.Charles in Florida"
5,Awesome Product!!!!,"I was skeptical to purchase this product for almost 20 bucks. I just bought a brand new BMW. I took it home and within a couple days I decided to give it a bath and nice wax job (with NuFinish). I noticed that after my wax, the paint still felt rough, even thought it was a new car. I realized that the paint had some pollen and sap and other junk that probably accumulated while it sat on the dealer's lot. So, I decided to order this product. This evening I followed the SUPER EASY directions, and within 5 minutes, I had an incredibly smooth hood. It was as if the car had just been painted. After applying the Mother's produc,t I reapplied my NuFinish wax and the car is gorgeous. I highly recommend this product."
5,clay bar is needed arsenol,I hope this product works as well as everyone says it does. I won't be using it anytime soon as I have a new truck but its for the near future
1,I do not get the product along with the rest,"I worry that I will not get the product to the rest of the items and I would like my money losing follow, UPS unknown product, apply a solution to my problem"
1,Horrible,Griots clay is much better. Mothers clay leaves streaks even when heavily lubricated making the whole process very difficult. Mothers products are not all that good in my opinion. overrated
3,Nevered Received Item,"Received notice that they could not deliver because i was not home, which is fine. I went to call the number left by onetrac after second notice. When I couldn't get a hold a them and then recieved notice that item is being return due to an undeliverable address and was refunded to cost but not the shipping cost and i am not happy about this at all.But back to the product, i went out and bought it at another store and used it on my truck and it worked great. It is a time consuming process but leave the paint smoother than glass, would recommend to anyone."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have been detailing cars and aircraft for forty years.I have tried almost every thing out there as far as waxes and cleaners go.I'm am a old school Simoniz guy. Yea, lots of work...but it works.I would always use a cleaner first, Dupont worked.I figured it might be time to try something new.So I tried the Mothers clay bar. Did not work well.I tried Meguires Clean and wax and that stuff is great.Tried Klasse, real good stuff.Micro fiber.. the more you spend, the better you get.The clay was a joke."
1,DID NOTHING!,Used it on 2005 Honda Accord (Eternal Bluee Pearl)to remove water spots. This product is useless. Definitely does not do what it advertises.
5,Wow!,"I was looking for products that remove light scratches in my car and happen to stumble upon this claying process. This product had good reviews so I tried it. I could not believe the filth the clay picked up off my car. There was stuff on my car that came off when conventional washing would not (I wash and waxed my car every year). While this is my first claying product, I am totally satisfied with Mothers gold clay bar system, and it is very easy to do. This product made my 2006 Honda Accord look showroom new. The silky feel and the paint reflection is incredible. Thanks for all the reviews who spoke of this process."
5,Worked very well,I used the clay system to remove specs of tree sap from my new car's paint as well as from the windows. The clay bar was easy to use and did an excellent job of removing the sap and leaving a very smooth surface. I applied a coat of Meguiars NXT liquid wax over the finish for a great and lasting finish.
5,It actually worked!,"I have been looking at clay products for years. Have seen them on the shelf at the local auto store. But never been game enough to blow the money on them.They are nearly triple the price here in Australia!Anyway, I saw them on Amazon and thought, what the heck.......I'll get one.Where have you been all my life! All those years of polishing the cars multiple times as well as cutting to get the contaminants off the surface.The clay is awesome! I had the bonnet done in under 5 minutes! Then followed a quick polish/wax and my car's surface has never felt or looked better!Very Impressed.Thanks"
5,Mothers Worked Great,"I never heard of clay baring until I started looking into how to care for the finish on a 2008 car I just bought. Everyone said to first clay bar, then wax. I looked into it extensively. Based on reviews of Mothers I tried it. It worked great! The cars finish is now as smooth as a babies bottom. The car didn't really need it but you could tell there was some stuff on the surface of the car so I figured that it couldn't hurt. I did put a tarp under the car and did drop the clay bar a few times so this saved a few clay bars. It's not a big car so it didn't take as long as I thought it would, less than 2 hours. It actually took less effort than I thought it would. It comes with 2 bars but I cut one in half and used just that half and that did the job very well and looks good enough to use again (can you use one again, it looks as yellow as when I started). I highly recommend Mothers."
3,"Great product, awful packaging.","The overall product works great. Used this on my Honda S2000 and it turned out very nice. The box it was shipped it was nice, but upon opening it the Mothers box itself looked like it was 10 years old, and was tossed around not - a brand new product. The box was torn and half way open, makes me think the product inside is super old and an inferior product."
5,Amazing stuff,"Run your hand across the paintwork of your car. If it doesn't feel like rubbing honey into Kiera Knightly then buy this.My car was covered in 200k of road crap, paint overspray, and bugs. This claybar got rid of the lot and the paintwork looks and feels like new.100% awesome"
2,Can cause scratches,This is going to a brief review. I tried clay bars after reading all the rave reviews on them. I think that claying helps with removing a good amount of the contaminants lodged on the surface and gives it a smoother finish that can be felt with the hand which will bring a smile to your face.On the other hand these contaminants transferred to the clay or in the paint cause scratches even when using a generous amount of the lubricant and rubbing carefully. I have frequently noticed new scratches just after I clayed my car. This did not bring a smile to my face. I had to spend extra time and effort polishing and waxing to get rid of these new scratches. I followed the exact instructions posted on the product but was not able to avoid these scratches.I think that either the directions and usage conditions need to be specified with more exactness OR the whole idea of claying is flawed.
3,It works I guess,"I used this and while it kinda worked, I didn't get the impression it did a whole lot. It cleaned the hard water stains from my sprinkler system but other than that, I guess my car wasn't that dirty. If you cash and wax your car on a regular basis I don't think this product is necessary, but if you buy a used car this would definitely be worth a look."
3,on the fence,"I'm still 50-50 with this product thus far. I say this with keeping in mind that maybe I haven't done the best job with it YET. I saw minimal results with it, but will give it another shot. Mothers is typically a good brand name."
5,Works great.,Easy to use. Works great on 7 year old paint. took about an hour for a large SUV. paint looks and feels smooth now.
5,New life for old paint,"I applied this product to my 2007 Mazda 3 (phantom blue mica) as well as a 2004 Nissan Sentra SE-R (black). The results were nothing short of amazing. I've detailed cars many times before, but never have I found a product which yields such a brilliant shine on a perfectly smooth surface. Paint looks and feels showroom new, and that's before applying any wax! Unbelievable! The box says this kit will do 6 cars, but I doubt that. One clay bar did 2 cars with ease for me, but the showtime spray ran out (could be due to inexperience though). I would highly recommend this product as it is well worth the money. My car has never looked so good!"
5,Makes your car super smooth and shiny!,"I used the clay bar on my Audi. I couldn't believe how much smoother my paint felt and how much dirt was in the clay after I used it. It made the paint look and feel like the cars in the showroom. I was actually asked how I got my car so shiny and clean looking. It was surprisingly easy and fast too, only about 10 minutes for the whole car."
5,Great clay for paint in good condition,"I've used other clay bars, but Mother's is the one that works best keeping our two cars (2003 & 2006) looking like new. I use a clay bar when the paint starts getting rough, follow it up with Klasse All-in-One and Klasse Sealant. The result is amazing and requires very little effort to keep it that way!"
5,Works great on overspray,"This product removed overspray in about two hours and saved me a ton of money. I was lucky to find out about this system and highly recommend it. It's easy to use, just wash and dry your car, and then in 2 feet blocks spray the lubricant and gently rub the clay bar on your car, wiping off excess lubricant and finishing with the wax included in the kit. My car looks like it did when it came off the lot! Couldn't be happier."
5,excellent product for a car,I enjoyed seeing my car looking like new with this product. The steps are easy to follow and excellent results!
5,Great Product!,This clay bar set works great. I used it numerous times on my and my friends cars. One box is enough for two cars if you use it properly: Split each clay bar into two peaces. And use one only for upper part of the car and the other for lower. In this case you can reuse them on your second car. You can also use clay bar for cleaning windshield - you'll see amazing results.- Remaining detail-liquid can be used to clean the car after wash.- You probably will need more than one towel to complete one vehicle. I bought mine in Wallmart.Don't forget two important things about this set:1.If you drop clay bar - DON'T USE IT.2. After clay bar - your car has to be polished and waxed.
4,Very Smooth Finish,The clay bar kit worked very well. It removed a lot of grit from my cars finish. The car was very smooth after the treatment. It made waxing so much easier. Very pleased with the finish of my car after using the kit. Only negative to offer is the price. Kind of expensive for what you get. Would like to see it cheaper or add some more clay to the kit.
3,Great for smooth clear surface,I purchase this item after reading most of the reviews. Actually this product creates a really smooth surface on the car body and cleans the contamiations cuased by the dialy use. But I didn't feel that the car is shinny like new. Maybe I'm not using it in the right way but I'm really I like the smooth surface.
3,No difference,I used this product to remove some white spots on a black car that seem to be etched in the clear coat. It did not work. I used the product as directed and still did not see any difference even on other areas of the car. Maybe this product was not intended for my specific problem.
3,The Final Mile,"With his very last project, DOO-BOP, trumpeter Miles Davis brought a fitting, if not exactly earth-shattering, conclusion to four and a half decades of forward-looking music by incorporating the commercially - and, perhaps, culturally - ascendant sounds of rap into his boundless conceptual universe. While few if any fans would be likely to rank this album (which was, alas, patched together posthumously) among Miles' classics, the Maestro could still blow a mean horn even in his final days, and there's plenty here worth listening to despite the distracting hip-hop overlays on a few tracks and lots of programmed percussion throughout. Granted, DOO-BOP might well have proven a worthier coda to jazz's most important postwar career had the artist himself lived to assemble it; but even as is it's among the better post-1980 Davis efforts and a good place for rap enthusiasts to begin the journey into jazz."
5,One hell of a change,Was it time for a change? Was he getting near the end when he wrote this album and realise he had to make one last stand? I think so. One of the greatest albums to emalgimate Rap and Jazz together under the one cool sound of the innovator- Miles Davis- The Chief
3,Back on the block with Miles,"An attempt from Miles to get into hiphop, but unlike other times where he tried to fusion his music with other types of music, nothing really new or exciting comes out of it. Instead it becomes a little mechanical with Miles blowing over some tracks, that sound like standard hiphop fare with slammin' drums and lots of loops. Maybe if Miles had participated himself in preparing the tracks, something interesting would have come of it, but except for tracks like ""Mystery"" and ""High Speed Chase"", generally the record sounds pretty sterile and not particularly engaging."
4,Hip Hop for Grownups,"Although there were a couple of tracks on this CD for which I didn't care, it's SO worth getting for the tracks that really stomp. Nice counterpoint between the driving rhythms and Davis's breathy trumpet style. Totally gets you juiced - try playing ""High Speed Chase"" while you are driving to work. No, don't.Easy Moe Bee is not a real asset on this recording- he comes across as juvenile-- really reaching for rhymes here. But if you forget about words and consider his voice to just be part of the musical landscape, then it works."
1,"What a pile of @#*($$*!!!, A sad end to a master.","Miles passed away before this CD was done, and yet it was put out? ($) If you like pre MC. Hammer Rap, and mindless 80's drum machine beats than go for it, yo! But instead, you may enjoy William Hung's new CD ""Inspiration"" more? It's current, upbeat, and worth every penny!!Hey jazz lovers, avoid this piece of garbage and invest in some good Coltrane, 60's 50"" Miles, Duke Ellington, Pepper Adams, Dexter Gordon, Cliffard Brown, Max Roach enc. enc."
4,Miles Last Album,"A few weeks ago while trying to get a BBQ together for 350 that was running behind I suddenly heard that familiar horn playing on the Chef's stereo but it wasn't the usual Miles Davis I was into. After inquiring I realized it was Doo Bop and after listening to a few cuts felt my tension melt away. A few days ago I picked up the album myself and loved it even though I'm mostly a fan of Miles stuff from the 50's and 60's. It's a shame Miles passed away while making this because I feel he was really on to something espeacilly considering that he was planning on working with Prince soon. If anyone is considering looking for something different than what Miles usually had put out, pick up this album today."
1,Are you Joking?,"This was thelast album performed by best jazz musician of all time's but other than for that reason, no one should buy this cd. If you love Miles stay away from ""Doo-Bop."" Miles does some fine trumpet playing as usual, but the backgrounds by Easy Mo Bee are absolutely terrible. I feel that to even produce the album was a dishonor to Miles. For example, two of the songs were compiled after Miles died, and the later added background absolutely ruined any respect I might of ever had for Easy Mo Bee and his taste in music. In addition, the lyrics to some of the tunes are so stupid. We already know he's playing with the ""legendary Miles Davis,"" and that his (Miles') ""horn can't be beat,"" so why does Easy Mo Bee have to rap about it. If you love jazz and more specifically Miles, stay away from this album. Pick up ""Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet."" It's definitely more worth it."
1,2nd-rate Miles Davis over a 2nd-rate hip-hop soundtrack.,"""Doo-Bop"" represents Miles Davis' last studio recording. I can think of nothing else of interest to note regarding this disc. If the liner notes are to be trusted, Davis chose hip-hop tracks laid down by ""Easy Mo Bee"" and played his trumpet over them. To give credit where it is due, some of his trumpet passages are worth hearing. Many more are not, certainly in comparison to the 40+ years of work he had laid down prior to this. As for the backing tracks, ""Easy Mo Bee"" hasn't been heard from again, and the reason why is not hard to determine from a quick listen to this: as hip-hop goes, this is not prime material. What seals the 1-star rating is the rapping. Even in the banality-drenched world of hip-hop, ""Easy Mo Bee's"" lyrics are worthless. This record is just awful; for Miles Davis completists and devotees of second-rate hip-hop only."
2,Questionable,"Perhaps Miles owed his dealer, or he was just plain bored, but this is an underwhelming foray into hip hop by a legend. It's not Miles so much as his collaborators, actually. The rapping is awful, and while this is from 1992, it sounds even more dated. Easy Mo Bee is not very impressive, period, and it's a rather ignominious note for Davis to go out on, though I believe he croaked while making it, so there's somewhat of an excuse. The best track is the opener, Mystery, which is reprised in the finale. It does sound rather generic now, but it's the high point on a forgettable chapter (his last) from the master himself."
2,No autofocus - poor picture quality,"third party software bundle rquires two resident programs sitting in you memory (it will get during installation into your system registry and load every time you start your PC) they say it's free of charge but as you know there is only free cheese in mousetrap.major cons is not existing autofocus. tiny focus adjusting ring is awkward to operate and at the end you still can't quite put it in sharp focus.cable is like 1.5 ft long. i guess it's ok for laptop but if you wanna use it for something else - just forget it, clip is also good for laptop screen only and not for anything else.automatic light adustement is just plain sucks. manual is a bit better but if you have to re-adjusted evry time you wanna use your webcam it becomes pain in the a**.i have two a4tech cheapper webcams without any third party useless software and with autofocus and they are way better than creative. SHAME ON YOU CREATIVE! i thought you could do better!"
2,Not that great,"It's small and the picture quality is ok. One main problem is the video lag, but that might be with all 15 fps cameras. I hate the fact that it needs all this installation software though. It should just plugin and work, especially with Vista. Bundled software and unnecessarily complicated drivers annoy me. Also the clip is too small, I have a thinkpad t60 and it's not big enough to fit over the top edge. I'm going to return it."
2,Not happy,I had another webcam from creative and that was awesome but even though this one is costlier I dont like the quality of this webcam. It doesnt adjust to different light conditions automatically and you have to open the software center and then manually adjust the brightness everytime u have little changes in the light conditions.
4,Good read,"I suggest this book to anyone who read and enjoyed the other Vor novels. I hate it when people tell me the story and/or give away plot information, so I won't. Read it."
5,my reason for reading,"Although this wasn't near the first book I read it was the first book I read over and over. This book mixes religin, magic and growing up all in a great story. I have read books from Ian Flemming, Stephen King, and many others, But Scott Ciencin is by far the greatest. He has a way of describing things that allows you to visualize what is happening. And the things you are visualizing are amazing. I loved this book and recommend it too people of all ages."
2,Early Hill/Spencer western has some good moments,"A better film than Boot Hill, this is one of three early Terence Hill/Bud Spencer westerns that led up to the classic ""Trinity"" films. Their characters here are nearly up to their mature ""Trinity/Bambino"" forms, but they must share the spotlight with Eli Wallach, who slows the film down enormously. There are some good scenes with Hill/Spencer antics that make the film noteworthy for their comedy fans, but mainly for completists."
1,Terrible book on runes,"Mr. Blum's book was good for one thing, bringing runes back into mainstream popularity. Unfortunetly, everything he writes lacks historical accuracy. His approach to the runes stems from a psychological view, as are his meanings. He has a tendency to use different names for the runes without any consistency.His creation of the blank rune even further shows his lack of historical accuracy, and shoddy research.There are so many books on runes that are muc better than anything made by Blum."
2,sadly it gets a 2,"This used to be one of my favorite books -- back in the old days. When I first aquired it, it was basically the only text on the runs that I'd run into regularly. And, since I love the book, I'd probably rate it a 5 ... except that I've come to accept that it isn't very historically accurate. It's a sad state of affairs."
5,What?,"I don't know what that first guy is talking about. This book is awesome! The perfect accessory to your rune set. I believe all the information to be consistant with other rune books I've read. Don't hesitate on this book, trust me."
5,AUTHORITATIVE and PRAGMATIC,"A believer in any and all religions will appreciate the universal and psychological approach of Meditation and Its Practices to explain the core spiritual facts which apply to everyone equally. This book is written for the student whose moral and spiritual education is based on sincere effort, an open mind and practical teachings. I appreciate that the author, Swami Adiswarananda, takes the reader seriously and presents a critical account of the subject which is then left in the hands of the reader to assimilate theory into practice. This guidebook becomes not only a thorough documentation of research on the subject of meditation in Hinduism's systems of Yoga and Vedanta; it looks for a real change and commitment to understanding the nature and final goal of religious and spiritual life, which is self-knowledge and a unity with all souls."
5,A Definitive Guide to Spirituality,"This book contains everything that you need to know. It is thorough, well written, insightful, and inspiring. I've read and reread sections numerous times for inspiration and guidance. It couldn't be any better."
3,Not multi-channel surround,"Just a clarification to the earlier review: this disc is stereo only, there is no multi-channel surround version."
3,Fresh from the package?,"the CD player skips at the slightest jostle or movement. It skips when I set it down on a table gently. It skips when I pick it up. It skips when I touch it. This is fresh from the package, new and with fresh batteries. the radio is very fuzzy and not clear at all."
3,Could Have Been Better,As a dancer in particularly west coast swing and knowing Robert Royston and his wife I really like the movie. However it felt short of how good it could have been. I could tell that the funding was not there to finish the movie and fill in the dead spots. It definately was not a dance with me or dirty dancing but could have been.
3,I am truly disappointed,"I don't know the lead guy but he wasn't very good. It was very difficult for me to connect with his character. I think he brought the movie down instead of enhanced it.And though I am familiar with and like most of the cast this movie could have been way better.... The writing, the plot, even the dancing was kind of weak.Personally I think some of the beginning weeks of dancing with the stars are more entertaining than this whole movie. I am truly disappointed."
2,innocuous romantic comedy,"Robert Iscove's ""Love N' Dancing"" chronicles the romance between an attractive middle school teacher and a deaf dance instructor she meets at a school assembly. The trouble is that Jessica (Amy Smart) is already engaged to a workaholic (a bald Billy Zane) who's always on his cell phone, while Jake (played by screenwriter Tom Malloy), who holds the title of World West Coast Swing Champion, is still carrying the torch for a former flame who has already moved onto a new love interest and dance partner.A paint-by-numbers romantic comedy, ""Love N` Dancing"" has moments of undeniable charm - in its early stages at least - but the triteness of the plotting, the uncharismatic performances, the motley secondary characters (Rachel Dratch and Bette White make brief appearances), and the surfeit of implausibilities wind up taking their toll in the end.The dancing is cool, though."
1,Horrible..,"...save your money...this film is terrible. Thank goodness I only rented it from Video on Demand. Dialogue is atrocious. I was hoping the dance sequences would save it...especially since Benji Schwimmer (Season 2 SYTYCD) is included, but there is actually very little dancing at all. Don't waste your time on this one."
5,Love N' Dancing,"Love N' Dancing is one of the most fabulous dancing movies I have ever seen since Patrick Swayze danced. The story is wonderful. Anyone who loves to watch ballroom dancing will find it and the stars who played in it such a tear-jerking story, and a movie you will not long forget and tell others about it.Iola Moore"
1,Worst Ever,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. With the exception of Caroline Rhea, every one in it was awful. The lead actor had one of the worst hair pieces I have ever seen. Couldn't even make it thru the entire movie."
2,kind of annoying,Kind of annoying.Another impulse purchase that will just sit in my collecton.Reminded me of the George Clooney move where he learned to dance.
1,tedious film with a flat script,"Welcome to the diverse world of dancing: Latinas are really feisty and hot blooded, lesbians are easily won over if they meet the right man, and gay men are so oversexed that they're licking their lips at straight men across the dance floor. These examples only begin to depict the 6th grade jokes and stereotypes that run through this movie. The dancing is exciting and energizing. It's too bad the world that it inhabits is so flat, predictable, and juvenile."
2,Secondary characters are the stars,"I love dancing and movies about dancing. The brightest spots of this movie are the secondary characters played by Billy Zane, Rachel Dratch and Caroline Rhea. There are also cameos by Dancing With the Stars winner Benji Schwimmer and partner Heidi Groskreutz-Burns. Otherwise blah."
5,Interesting read,If you like to know more about the journey of Sid Roth here's your chance. I enjoyed his honesty and his witness of how God can change a person. This man is smart and on fire for God.
1,Sorrowful Schubert,This SACD of Schubert's 9th symphony is one of the worst recordings I've ever heard. I don't know why Sony put this on SACD. The instrumental fidelity is nonexistent and there's no sound stage.
3,Classic Eddie!!,"Obviously there is not a single bad thing to be said about Eddie Izzard as he is the single funniest person to come from the UK. However as any true Eddie Izzard fan would understand, he must be seen as well as heard. Although you can picture him as you listent to this CD, you really need to see his mannerisms. Still very funny but not as highly recommended as his DVD's are."
5,Dr. Wolinsky's work is a must-read for all who are ready....,"Morpheus of this reality, open yourself to the wisdom of Nisargadatta Maharaj. One of the most important book I have read since ""I AM That."" Dr. Wolinsky lead us skillfully and corageously beyound the three veils of The Matrix (Consciousness)his work is must-read for all people who are ready to take responsibility for their own destiny."
3,Haggai and Malachi (Everymans Bible Commentaries) by Herbert Wolf,"These Moody Press Commentaries are well worth reading. Often, when reading bulkier expositions one has to wade through a wad of unnecessary pages of writings of liberal theologians. These commentaries start from the premise inspired of God.... Period! Herbert M. Wolf has a gift of making complicated things easy. His explanation of the problematical chapter 2 verse 7 'The Desire of nations' is alone, worth the price of the book. Richard Cummings, Wellington, Somerset."
4,An introduction to tomatoes,"Those first-time gardeners interested in growing tomatoes will find Tantalizing Tomatoes to be an excellent introduction to North America's most beloved fruit/vegetable. The book covers everything that one needs to know from the history of the tomato through propigation, pest control and, finally, popular tomato recipes."
4,Good Beginner Book,"This was a good beginner book on growing tomatoes. It included some history, how-to, deciphering seed packet, and information on different varieties of tomatoes. If you are passed the beginner/novice stage, I recommend some thing a little more informative. It was an easy read and it gave me some ideas to try on my suffering tomatoe plants."
1,Where are all of the top-quality images?,"I am a Macintosh fan and try not to have any Microsoft products on my computer, including Microsoft Word. So, I was dismayed when the instructions for this clip-art collection were in Microsoft Word. As far as I know, there are no other instructions on the web or anywhere else, and this company would not tell me over the phone how to use the software (unless I wanted to pay $10 extra.) I have fiddled with this program and as far as I can see, there are only about 100 images that are high quality. (Maybe there are more, but I have not been able to figure it out.) Even though this program only cost $30, I have not been able to come up with any images that are usable, and have not been able to come up with a complete set of instructions. I feel like I have been ripped off!"
1,This software does deserve to have a Star!,"I have to say this product does not deserve any stars. The only thing that's true on the items box is the fact that there are 3 CD's inside. I was very disappointed with this software. When I seen this software in the store my first thought was that I should not buy it. I guess that's why some people say go with your first thought. I wish I had. After hearing about the customer service for this product, I did not bother to even call them to ask them where the other images were..such as the high resolultion photos and the fonts. But oh, well you live and you learn."
3,Spaghetti Western,This movie was released 9/2/1973. The title states that this movie was digitally remastered but it was still a horrible copy. This is a typical Spaghetti Western. Once I got used to the poor quality and got into the movie I found it entertaining. It wasn't as obnoxious as some other Spaghetti's I have watched and it had a good story that held my interest. If I could have I would have given it 3 1/2 stars.
5,Outstanding control,"The control of the Altissimo range in Larsson's Concerto is amazing, Savijoki's tone is a beautiful, dark, rich sound."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD!!!","Thief and artist, Kidd, returns with his sometime lover and fellow thief Luellen, in this new novel from bestselling author John Sandford.When Jack Morrison is killed during what is called a routine robbery, his sister Lane wants answers, and to get them she will enlist the help of Kidd. As Kidd and his group of thief/pals begin looking into the death, they see connections to the high-tech company where Jack was killed.Who cares?I could not even finish this book, it is slowly paced, and filled with too many characters and high-tech jargin that I quickly lost interest. I have been a fan of Sanford's ""Prey"" novels for years, and am very disappointed in this departure.Fans of Sandford's books should pass on this, and await the next Davenport novel.Nick Gonnella"
1,Not a keeper!,"This may be the one John Sandford novel I do not keep. Couldn't wait to be finished. It failed to keep my interest, perhaps because I'm technologically deficient, but it was so convoluted that I was never sure where it was going. Give me Lucas Davenport any day."
2,You got to be kidding,"The Devil's Code is a big disappointment. A Sanford novel is usually a treat especially if Davenport is prowling the Twin Cities. This Kidd novel lacks any real plot development, is trite and has no imagination. I picked up this book and read it in one sitting. There was no spark that would hold the reader. Being in the computer field, the book was even more tedious. Sanford should stick to what he does best. There seemed to be little effort in writing this book and the story meandered all over the place. I would recommend passing on this book and hope Cromwall is better in two weeks. The code for this book was definitely decipherable: a very poor effort by Sanford."
1,Boring..boring..boring,"I too was eagerly awiting a new Sandford book. Unfortunately, this was not the book I expected. It was extremely difficult to get intoand I only finished it because I forced myself to. The plot was too convoluted and impossible to follow. We expect more from this author..."
3,Easy to read dribble,"This book was too easy to read. The pages fly by as Kidd and LuEllen banter back and forth, battling the evil US government and evil US government contractors. It takes about 290 pages to discover why the bad guys are willing to kill in order to prevent the public from finding out what they are doing. As an engineer, I found some of the technical details humorous. Sandford (Camp) certainly tried to make it plausible, but I don't think so. One thing I didn't like was the lighthearted treatment of our heroes' moral behavior. And the connection of internet friends that help them is beyond belief as well. All in all, the book is entertaining, but not suspenseful, and a little hollow."
3,average sandford,"This books has traditional features of other John Sanford novels: again it is well written, again the ending is the weakest part of the story, again there is a constant droning of left-wing party line on the background.Plot is (while it is full of holes) better than one in average Sandford's ware, ending is more disappointing than usual, left wing dronning is at annoyingly moronic level: good guys are tieves and members of exterme left underground, bad guy is a Republican, former intelligence officer and has a ranch in Crawford, TX etc. etc.So, overal level is average."
4,"A good read with accessible, fun characters!","I knocked this whole book out while stuck in a plane on the tarmac during a flight delay! The plot concerns a mysterious conspiracy involving several twists and, as one protagonist in the book states, an alphabet soup of government agency acronyms. I especially enjoyed the main character, Kidd, and his narrative perspective that described his actions and observations blow-by-blow forsaking flowery prose for to-the-point story line. If you like difficult to guess conspiracies seasoned with wry action and even some medium dark humor, then give this book a try! As for me, I plan to pick up the preceeding ""Kidd"" books to see how this interesting character came to be."
2,Quit with 40 pages to go,I got to page 320 or so and didn't care enough to finish it. I still don't know what happened. For me the wall was an inane discourse on art having nothing to do with story in the run up to the climax. I think i've been reading too many classics lately. I just can't stomach this writing any more.
3,"Fast-paced, high-tech suspense","John Sanford, author of the ""Prey"" series (""Easy Prey,"" ""Certain Prey"") brings back an earlier hero, Kidd, artist, computer whiz and criminal, and his even more secretive sometime partner/lover LuEllen in ""The Devil's Code"". Two contract murders jumpstart Kidd's entry into a high-tech, high-speed chase after a conspiracy fueled by greed and guarded by murder.Kidd, looking into the shooting death of a friend and fellow hacker, soon grabs the disks that doomed his friend, making himself a marked man. Trouble is, there's nothing damning on the disks. But his efforts attract the notice of the FBI, the CIA, National Security and the cabal of villains who may themselves be part of the alphabet soup.There's more flash than substance here but Sandford keeps the story hopping with plenty of action and clever stunts, high tech and low. Kidd and LuEllen are a likeable, if standoffish, duo and the writing is as pared down and smooth as a speeding Ferrari."
2,A good book for a middle school student,"Overall this was a sub-standard book. I'm in high school and I found this book to be very boring. The premise was interesting. The lack of insight into the characters and little setting discription lead me to believe that the book was written just to get another book published. It's like reading a bad, made for television movie. Better chooses are Anna Karenina and The Partner.This isn't a book that's worth buying in hardcover!"
3,"""TO MUCH HI-TECH""","I don't know why I keep on reading the books about Kidd and LuEllen. I really like their characters, I guess is why. John Sandford has to be a brilliant writer to write the Prey series and then to wirte books like this. I really, really like Davenport Prey books. I like the Kidd and LuEllen books because of the mystery, action and suspense but I cannot understand the high-tech and computor stuff--way over my head, so I loose a big part of the books. If you like mystery and computor stuff you will like this book. If you like mystery and lots of scary action you will like the Prey series. Sandford can't loose."
3,"OK, I guess",I did not like it as well as his Prey series. The characters were just there and did not really care about anyone. Almost too simplistic. Would probably read another one hoping that would be better. Did like LuEllen though.
3,Not nearly as satisfying as most Sandford books....,Being an avid fan of the 'Prey' series this book was a bit of a disappointment. I have read the two previous Kidd books and liked them better than this one as well. I kept expecting something more to happen here. I would agree with other reviewers about the characters not being as well drawn as they could have been. The most I can say is this is not a bad book but neither will you stay up late to finish it either. A luke-warm review for a luke-warm book. <Ree-views>
1,Disappointed In John Sandford,"I felt t was a waste of money and time - I did not finish this book - first time in many years. I have read most of Sandford's books - but could not follow this one - It was just very, very boring. The only little flavor in the book was reading about LuEllen - did not even turn to the last page - couldn't care at all.."
3,The plot jumps around a lot,Difficult (for me) to know where I am with this story. I just do not enjoy it as much as some of his other novels.
2,Crap-o-la. Move on to the next one on your list,"Not worth your time, not worth your money, not worth 3 stars, not worth it.....and definitely not worth my time writing this review."
2,Couldn't Wait for it to End,"Many readers on various book sites would tell me, ""you've gotta read the Kidd series by Sandford."" This was the first that I read and it was a bit of a snore. This Kidd individual seems pretty shallow as his character has no depth or reality to it. LuEllen was a more interesting person than Kidd and maybe it would have been better if the story centered on her. Don't waste your time with this one. Sandford should stick with his ""Prey"" series."
2,Disappointed!,"I was excited to find this book on sale as John Sanford is one of my favorite authors and I love the suspense of his Prey novels. Wish I could say the same for this Kidd novel. I have to say I thought the characters were shallow, and Kidd was a pig. I had trouble getting past Kidd's behavior. The plot was ultra-slow to develop and very scattered. I'd recommend skipping this one and reading the edge of your seat Prey thrillers with characters that you can route for."
3,"Not bad, not great","If you're into techno-weenies seemingly effortlessly hacking everything in sight, this excursion may appeal to you. This assumed omniscience is a bit off-putting, however, and certainly drains most of the sense of danger to the protagonists from the intrigue (rather anemically) generated by the plot line. I did finish it, in one sitting, in fact, but can't say I'd rush back for sequels, if offered.Got a Pan-Pacific flight in 36E, stuffed between the snoring fat man and the hypergonadal teenager? Perfect fare to buffer out the infelicities of the situation!"
2,I'm being generous giving this book 2 stars,"I gave this book 2 stars because I just finished ""The Run"" which was much worse."
2,"Disapointing read, it happens. Author of LAST CALL",Kidd is a interesting enough character but the story was sad. I only read this book all the way to the end because of my faithful following of John Sandford. Devil's code has a lot going on but the attempts made to grab my attention suffered severly.
3,Good stuff,"A Kidd Novel.Kidd is an artist and computer programmer (read hacker) who sometimes is open to getting into, what shall we say? A little trouble? A little breaking and entering? A little Robin-hood type thing?He's a semi-good guy with a semi-good heart who takes matters into his own hands when a friend/hacker buddy gets killed.LuEllen is the female version of Kidd, who accompanies him on this romp.Fun, fast read. Good stuff."
3,Not too good,Don't know why I kept reading this. Hoped it would get better because I like his prey books. The characters didn't seem right and the plot was unbelievable. Guess he wrote this during the dot.com boom.
2,The only Sandford book I didn't like,I have tried several times to get through this book and finally decided to simply stop trying. I cannot explain what is so different about this book from his other novels. It seems to move too slow and the plot is simply dull. There isn't enough depth to the characters. It started off with a spark and quickly fizzled. I am sure this one was just a fluke.
1,the devil's code-johnsandford,"Nobody bats a thousand! Having read all of Mr. Sandford's previous works, and fully enjoying each, I awaited eagerly publication of his latest, The Devil's Code. Alas, I found it to be a major disappointment. I got through about 200 pages (re- reading at least half that number in an effort to glean some clues about the plot line)before giving up on it. I have no idea what this book is about or why Mr.S. chose to load it up with so much computer esoterica....It is not my purpose to demean the author who, I know, can write up a storm when he's on. Having gotten this rare mistake out of his system, it is my hope (and belief) that his next novel will show a return to his normally excellent form."
4,Good book,"I thought it slowed down in a few spots. I like the Kidd series, but thought the first two were a better."
4,kept me engaged,this book did not diappoint the author always comes through with an engaging read worth the time and loved the ending
4,Good product - would recommend,Pros:-went together very quickly-finish is very niceCons:-Screws that hold roof section to rest of the structure are exposed on top - this will be a path for rot over time
5,Was a gift for a friend,"My friend loved this book!!! I gave it to him for his birthday. It still had the shrink wrap on, and it arrived just in time for his party. The photos were beautiful."
5,Awesome,"Season 4 of The Hills is awesome, though too much focus is on Spencer and his relationships. Heidi and Spencer feature heavily in season 4 which includes their wedding ups & downs. Great season and can't wait for season 5 :)"
5,The Hills,"I purchased the Hills for my daughter and we were both very impressed with the Amason service. It was prompt, in perfect condition - wonderful will use it again!"
2,No setup instructions at all,"I have about 3 dozen router bits, and I do a lot of routing and shaping. Set up for this bit is a mystery, though. The equivalent Aman bit has very clear setup instructions that make the process much more intuitive. The Freud bit comes without even a simple diagram.If someone has a web link to a page featuring setup instructions, i'd gladly update my review. However, Freud really ought to print something more useful on the back of the package than ""Danger: Bit is sharp!"""
2,Great idea - hard to set up,"This bit has a lot of potential, but lacks instructions which makes it very difficult to set up. For as much money as one has to shell out for bits like this, you would think the manufacturer would include something - anything - even a hint, as to how to set it up (without burning through test piece after test piece - everytime you need to work with a different thickness of wood. Come on Freud, you can do better."
2,Oxfort vinyl magazine binder,Purchased these binders for an office setting waiting room. I wanted something to protect our written information in a waiting area and to keep people from walking off with useful magazines in our small office... These binders have very thin clear plastic covers that are already tearing from repeated use after a few monthes. I would not recommend this binder for heavy use but maybe for just preserving a copy of a magazine that is not used often
2,DOES NOT FIT,"I can't get this stocking over my thighs, I am a size 14. This sucks, but it is very nice. I guess I will lose weight."
1,One Size does not work,"This product is well made but one size do not fit most. It would to big for someone small not bad on an average person and not pretty on someone large. Then wash it, see who all could fit in it now, I mean how many of us at once. Waste of money."
3,"its pretty, not on me","I am around 5'1 and 150. ok. honestly, 155. I buy stockings because they usually make me FEEL sexy. They hide bumps and show off my better features.Regarding these stockings:Pros:the pattern on this is beautiful.it is fairly durable for a stocking.price was decentlooks great on the model.cons:its to loose in the back (probably because i'm short)its to tight around my thighs (probably because i'm fat)It shows off my cellulite. (which i already pointed out is usually HIDDEN by this kind of clothing)and downplays any pleasant curve I have. (i feel blah in it.)Overall, i'm disappointed. I will try to dress it up a bit. maybe slip it under a dress (i love the pattern), but i doubt that i will ever like it much. even if hubby does.--- note: At the suggestion of another reviewer, i tried it on backwards. It looks much better. specifically with a bra. Almost like a corset, but not. I think i can wear it this way with a vest or jacket and a short skirt. --- much happier."
5,Super Sweet!!!!!,"My wife ordered this as another weekend surprise. It is both beautiful and sexy.....an we no that most of this type of gear is usually one or the other at best. It shows off the entire female form, without the let-down of cheap fishnet. I'd give it a 9 out of 10. If this is on an attractive woman, you will be thrilled with the look"
5,Body Stocking,The Body Stocking That I ordered and had delivered to another party was recieved by that party and she is so much in love with it. It has such a diverse pattern (not what is pictured in the ad) but it has many different possibilities of what she has in her inventory. mixing and matching et al....
3,shirley of hollywood lace body stocking,"Nice but runs big. I am 5' 6"" and between 145-147 lbs. It is a bit long and wide for me so if you are any smaller don't get it."
5,Seductive & Sexy Awesome,"Guys this is something you definitely you want you goddess to wear!!Wow when you see her walk out into the bedroom with this on it's instant turn on!!I have bought a lot of baby dolls but this was the hottest!!the only thing the open crotch should be just a little more open for the aggressive lover!!I HIGHLY recommend this body stocking,It will make your dreams come true!!My woman looked awesome in it!!she is the hottest woman in the world,my soul mate!!Jeff"
1,Horrible Customer Service,"Before my order was even processed, I asked it be canceled. I tried to cancel it twice, to no avail instead they put the order through and said to late to cancel!"
5,Fits perfectly!,"I'm so glad I chose this stocking! It fits so well, like it's meant for me. You can put it and take of easily. It's really great, and what's most important , I feel sexy :)"
3,"Adequate, not great","Mr. Lindberg does well, but the ""Flight of the Bumble Bee"" is sloppy at the end, and generally mushy articulation. His ""Czardas"" is highest quality as is the ""Blue Bells of Scotland"". In general, his tone quality loses a lot in the low register, but is great in the high register. He also does not project too well on the fortissimo passages."
3,"great player, selection of music a bit disappointing","I hated to rate this a 3 stars, because the trombone playing is awesome! However, the selection of music leaves much to be desired, in my opinion. However, 2 of the selections, Flight of the Bumblebee (did he really play the trombone that fast? ), and Blue Bells of Scotland (magnificent!), are so tremendous that any trombone player should buy this CD just for those 2 tracks."
3,Lapsang Smokeout,"Smoked meats...........................checkSmoked cheese..........................checkSmoking a pipe agrees with me..........checkDrinking a stout single-malt scotch....checkTwinings Lapsang Souchong.......................check againI have never been so overwhelmed by a smoky smell in a long, long, time. Whoever above described this as campfire, was right on target. If you are a fireman, then this will overtake you like the scene of the crime.I love smoked goods, particularly meats, cheeses and scotches. I'm not sure I will be able to handle too many more cups of this, and its not the taste. The taste was great, but the note in the room was overwhelming.I'm going to take the rest of this box to work and share it with my co-workers. I may try and find another variety of Lapsang to compare against, but the Twinings is definately in your face (and pantry).If you want to preserve your sanity and marriage, be sure to get a ziploc freezer bag to contain your Lapsang."
1,Yikes! Gross,"Yikes, this flavor is gross. It smells/tastes like a musty old basement. Reminded me of summer camp in an old log cabin. Avoid..."
1,"Very, Very Disappointing!","I have had Twinging's Lapsang Souchong in the U.K., and this is a totally differrent and inferior product. There is barely any smokey flavor -- it is as though they have put it through the flaor removing machine. I suspect it is either very cheap Lapsang Souchong or they are mixing it with an unsmoked black tea. Definitely inferior. Try another brand or try to get the UK version in the black box. Yuck!"
5,Perfect price!,"My best friend loves this tea, so I researched several sites and this was by far the cheapest! She was very greatful for this gift.. She says it's hard to find!"
3,Twining,"Good strong smoky flavor,a little too strong for me.I do however love Twinings tea.I use to work for a wholesale foods distributor and Twinings was our tea of choice"
5,An acquired taste...,"This isn't your ordinary, boring, Lipton black tea. It has a very unique flavor and aroma--what some call campfire, but to me is more leathery. It's smooth and intense, without being overpowering, and is probably one of my top favorite teas.In short, you'll either love it or hate it.Be prepared to store this tea in a airtight container (a zip lock seems to work fine) if storing with other teas. If not, your stash will take on the flavor and smell of the Lapsang. I ruined a whole box of Lady Grey that way."
5,"great product, great company","Twinings makes the best tea for folks on a budget, and Lapsang Souchong is no exception. A great black tea, prepared well and consistently. I bought 12 boxes up front, so that should tell you how much I love this tea. :)"
1,I didn't think any tea could taste so grotesque...AWFUL,"As a connoissuer of a wide variety of fine loose teas sold by tea specialists, I am not such a ""tea snob"" that I am above enjoying high-quality packaged teabags produced for the mass market. This tea, however, is the most nauseating blend I have ever sampled. I brewed as per directions, and the ""stench,"" not the aroma, almost prevented me from tasting it, but I did. Taking one small sip proved more than enough. If a smoked side of a hog or such were to be immersed in water, and served as tea, it could not be worse than this ""smokey"" blend. Even when poured down the sink, the odor left behind required some added clean-up. This was given to me as a gift; a very poor choice. I would not even donate the sealed packets to a food bank...it would be an insult."
1,Very strong unpleasant aftertaste,Some of the reviews warn about the strong smokey aroma. They could not describe how pungeant this is and it leaves a strong lasting after taste. I threw all the tea away since it is not eligible for return. FYI the other Twinings products are excellent.
3,TEA DOES NOT TASTE SAME AS I HAVE HAD BEFORE,THIS LAPSONSONG SOUCHONG TEA DOES NOT TAST THE SAME AS THE SAME TEA I HAVE HAD IN THE PAST.R. WOOLFE
3,Rather disappointed,"Though satisfied with the promptness of delivery, I found the flavor of the tea not up to what I expect from Twinings. Oddly enough, the aroma of the packages is quite alluring. I can smell it even in the wrapped box. It is no doubt Lapsang Souchong, but once it is brewed it tastes like ordinary black tea. While I intend to enjoy the entire set and try to alter my brewing technique,I will have to choose a different brand next time."
4,Husband Loves It,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves the smokey flavor and drinks at least two cups a day. I can never find it in stores so I was glad to find it on Amazon.
4,nice size,these are a nice size pads...quite a lot of them before u run out of them..i use them for everything..for my notes when reading ..and also to make grocery lists to stick on the refrig...the only drawback is ...they dont stick well..they drop off doors and walls...i guess its only meant for books...but i remembr post it pads normally wud stick well.
2,Not the product photographed,"I ordered these expecting legal pads with sticky on the paper. What i got was big post its with lines on them. They just look like regular colorful post-its, not like the pads photographed. There is nothing wrong with them, but I just want people to know what they are getting..."
5,Wonderful! Super fast shipping!,Wonderful! Super fast shipping! Couldn't be more pleased. Ordered for grandson's B-day and it arrived much faster than promised. Great quality and exactly what I was looking for! He loves the story with he and his brother in it! Thanks!
4,Feelin Hot Hot Hot,"Curry has become one of my favorite foods over the past year. We've always struggled to make good curry at home as the grocery store curry pastes don't have very much flavor. I always found myself having to use an entire jar instead of the 1Tbsp that they tell you to use.A friend of ours recommended we try this brand. It had AWESOME flavor but ended up being a tad too spicy for our taste. I'm not sure we'll purchase it again. If we do we now know to not use quite as much.We've really been enjoying the Mae Ploy brand of curry pastes which can be found here on Amazon as well.If you like your green curry at Thai spice levels though, you'll LOVE this!"
4,A yearly read at the holidays.,I really enjoyed this little gem. My wife and I read it the same night and had similiar thoughts. A great story with a predictable ending. But what's wrong with a warm feel-good read at this time of year!
4,A must Christmas read !,"After reading this book, I shared it with a friend who isn't a reader. She loved it! One of the copies I'm ordering today is for this friend to place in her church library and one copy is for my church library. It is an inspiring book for anytime of the year, but especially at Christmas."
5,if you love dancin' then you'll love sweatin',"this tape was so much fun. i'm a very lazy person and hate exercise but when i bought this tape and put it on to see what it's about i just couldn't help shaking my tush!!! it's packed with stretching, low-impact aerobis, and weight training all done in a ""dancy"" fun manner! another thing i loved is that the people doing the workout in the video are all normal looking poeple of all shapes and sizes! if you love dancing to the oldies, then you'll love this tape."
2,Just o.k.,It would have been better if the moves were shown at a slower pace & then speed up so you have a chance to learn the steps.
2,Did not enjoy this workout....,"I do acknowledge that a lot of people enjoy this series of tapes/dvds and have lost weight using them, but I did not enjoy this workout. I have some of his other tapes (not in the Sweatin to the Oldies series) that I like much better!"
4,Richard is the Best. This isn't his best.,"I use this and Sweatin' to the Oldies III. I love the music and dancing, however it is hard to follow this video because the camera isn't always on Richard at the beginning of a dance or when he changes steps. Head shots don't help with foot work. STTO III is more professional in this regard. At first I thought that this didn't provide as good a workout as STTO III, but my heart rate and sweat prove otherwise. I believe it is because these dances use your arms more. Richard is great for those of us who don't have perfect bodies and probably never will. Even though I am toned and losing weight, I will never look like Denise Austin or Kathy Ireland. I've just ordered the original STTO and will let you know what I think."
5,Great Workout!,This one is the best. The songs are great and the workout is fantastic. This is my all time favorite workout video.
3,"gettin' artsy, there rich.","good:the exercises are more complicated and much more varied.almost the same cast.pretty good songsbad:artsier and more ambitious. (the band arrives via sparkles? what universe is this?) i preferred the simpler setup of sweatin to the oldies one.richard talks more. a lot more.i would suggest watching the tape once before you exercise to get an idea of the movements so you're not stumbling, mouth agape as you reorient yourself every eight/four/single beats."
4,Great video,I ordered this video to inspire me to exercise more. I knew you can't go wrong with Richard Simmons as a workout instructor. I am enjoying the video.
2,Wrong size,"Have ordered this item 3 different times, 3 different sizes and not one of them has matched the description given on the website or on the box. This does NOT fit all 4 passenger carts. It measures only 85"" long."
5,"Great value, quality, design","We have not had a lot of time to use our cover yet, but considering how much you can pay for one of these things, this is truly a great value. We've been boaters for 30 years, so we've seen, repaired and replaced a lot of canvas/clear vinyl product for similar use in another application. We are extremely impressed with the quality of the product and the cleverness of the design to create a useable, drive-able enclosure that fits such a wide range of golf carts. From the moment we started unpacking it the quality was evident. The attention to detail is impressive, from the stitching to the waterproof lining to the strong zippers, the tie-ups, and the included carry bag. You might get more with a custom enclosure, but expect to spend at least four times as much."
4,I'm glad I got it!,This is a good product. We got it to use at a campsite. The only problem I had was getting it onto the cart. It was really heavy and I wasn't sure what way to put it on at first. All in all...it does what it is supposed to do :-)
3,romancing the samoa,"It's all about culture. What she fails to do though is to discuss what creates culture that we are socially constructed therefrom. Her key subject of youthful sexual relations is in great question and one should read Freeman to see a different view of the romantic tribe that Mead tried to capture in words by visiting only 5 months in which her informants lied about sexual relations that she based her ethnology on. Freeman is a more objective view if that is possible. And more importantly listen to the Samoa themselves above all so-called intellectuals. It is their culture and history afterall - not Freeman's or Mead's interpretation of it. With regard to Mead, she has her conclusion set even before she has started her study and this taints her work, but worth reading nevertheless for historical purpose - but not necessarily for facts."
2,Disappointed,The quality of the workmanship isn't my expected. It isn't neat as the picture shows. The needle work is very rough. I like the confort of the shoes but don't like such roughly sewed.
3,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with this product because the book is written in with half of the exercises already completed, the cover was dirty, and there are stains on pages through out the book. From the seller's description I was expecting a book in better condition."
4,The practice of harmony,When I got htis book in the mail I have to be honest I was very dissapointed with the packageing it came in. It got wet I wasn't happy about that. It said (new) but when I see (new) I expect it to be with out creases or wet. Over all it has all the pages that I need and because of that I wont be mean and give this the deserving 3 stars. Better packageing next time not card board but and actual bubble wrap bag.
4,Get stretched!,"Overall, I enjoy the flexibility of this tape. It's broken into two sections, so you can do a full hour of yoga, or just a half hour and save the other section for another day. Some of the poses are tough and really give you something to reach for. I use it regularly."
3,"Some good, some bad....","First, the cons: Does anyone else detest sun salutations as much as I do? There are about 8 minutes of them on this tape. I just fast forward it at that point. The glitzy production is too much for me as well. There are spotlights, fake sunsets and clouds, fake sand and a fake picket fence. The camera often switches to unnecessary i.e. tilted angles as if it were a music video. The hardest part for me is I find myself constantly changing my mat in order to follow what is happening.The pros: I consider myself an advanced beginner. The poses are not too difficult, and I still get a good stretch. Kathy's presence and clear instructions are great. I suppose with many repetitions the talking would get tiresome, but she is very good at explaining how the poses should feel. The tape moves at a decent pace. Power yoga it isn't. I rented this from the library. I would still purchase it if it didn't have such a long segment of those tiresome and dreaded sun salutations."
2,Keep looking,"I'm fairly new to yoga, but I checked this dvd out at the library. Something to be said that it was available. The tape says it's 2-30 minute workouts, but the 2nd one is only about 15 minutes. It's very short. It seemed pretty easy and somewhat boring to me after the 6th workout. I have ordered Crunch - Total Yoga and Yoga Conditioning For Weight Loss (Suzanna Deason), both of which have great reviews. We'll see."
4,Sergent's sort of Mexican Reggae cd,"Well anyone that loves Latin world music or the ultimate world music Reggae, I think should like this album. The album has several different schools of music on it..but the nod to Sancheze style reggae is great."
5,More than expected,"The packaging made the item even more special, as it was a gift for someone. Very pleased. Great price. Thank you."
4,About the Different Versions,"A word about the different versions which have caused some bad review comments. Partly this is a problem with Amazon's listings. They list two versions with the same comments tagged to both. I bought the one with ISBN-10: 0634078690; that is the ""regular"" version of the book. It's normal arrangements of the song for piano, guitar and vocals. Like many arrangements it might change the key and it's certainly simplified. It's at the intermediate level.There is also an ""easy play"" version ISBN-10: 1423410092. Although my comment will show up for that version, I didn't buy it. These are very simple arrangements, ideal for beginners or early intermediates who don't want to have to work too hard at a piece.I have enjoyed playing through some of the pieces. Georgia on my Mind, one of my favorite pieces, is well done with some of the small details done quite nicely. One star off for not including ""Hit the Road Jack""."
1,Kathy Smith let me down,"I asked for and got this video as a Christmas present, expecting it to be as fun and challenging as Kathy's other videos. I am very disappointed. Kathy's cueing is way off, the music isn't exciting at all, and the dancers are intimidating. I have done the tape twice now, and both times I found myself checking my watch to find out when I would be done. I exercise to videos about 5 times a week, consider myself at an intermediate level, and the tape didn't even allow me to break a sweat. This video will surely collect dust at my house."
1,"Bad tape , not good for weight loss","This tape I found too slow and boring and not good for weight loss. The moves are basic cha cha and salsa and that isnt going to get anyones heart rate up. If your looking for results and dont have time to lolly gag around then dont waste your money, instead get her step videos for some real results."
4,Ok,"The 2 20-minute workouts get 3 stars and the bonus section 5 stars.This workout is pretty easy to follow and I thought, Kathy did a very good job teaching each type of dance step in the first part of the workout. However, there are sections in the middle and in the second half that didn't flow well. It seemed that she was not in synch with the music at times, which was distracting. The music isn't that great either. Also, if you've ever tried the awesome Latin Xplosion with Carlos then you know, this just doesn't even come close.In the bonus partner dance section (without Kathy), one of the male and female exercisers demonstrate how to dance Salsa, Merengue and ChaCha. They both do an excellent, excellent job and make it look super easy to learn."
5,Fun and Effective!,"I bought this video despite some of the less-than-positive reviews that were written on it here. I'm really glad I did. While it doesn't get my heart pounding, it is a good workout if you just need to move around. I work out almost daily, so I use this one twice a week to keep my workouts fun. The choreography is good -- the cueing could use some work, but once you've done it a few times, it's not too hard to keep up with the changes. The group she has is enthusiastic, and the music is really upbeat. I would recommend this video for anyone looking to break the monotony of the weekly workout schedule. Plus, you learn some pretty nifty dance steps!"
1,Kathy Smith's No Rhythm Latin Workout,"Kathy Smith can count but she is totally devoid of rhythm. Her annoying ""Oooowwws"" throughout the dvd are just awkward. The selection of music is okay but the instructors that helped her with the dvd must have been playing a joke on her. This dvd lacks latin style, rhythm and professionalism. This dvd seems like someone filmed a free salsa lesson at a low rent club and then decided to make an improptu workout dvd as an afterthought.I'd like my money back, please. Don't waste your time on this one. All parties involved in this video should be embarrassed. [...] I also have to fault myself. I saw the clip but I was hoping from the other Collagevideo reviews that there might be something redeeming in this, but there wasn't."
5,"Fun,fun,fun","The music in this video is infectious! Even if you aren't a dancing type of person (I'm not) you can't help but move along with it. The dance steps are easy to follow in the demo, but can get a bit fast in the actual workout. I'm surprised at the amazon.com review which says it's hard to get your heart rate up with this video. Oh really! If you're a monumentally fit person who works out for 3 hours everyday and has a resting heart rate of 25, maybe. The average person WILL get to target heart rate with this workout if they keep up with the dancers in the video. Great video and I just LOVE that music!"
1,What Happened Kathy?,"I couldn't wait to get this video. I purchased it from Amazon.com. As soon as it arrived, I put it in. It was terrible. I have had some lessons in Merengue, Salsa and Latin Dancing (I am a Spanish Teacher) and thought this would be a great 'different' way to work out. I was wrong. Kathy was too dressed up and looked like she was going out, not working out. I didn't break a sweat, was bored and kept telling myself that it will get more challenging. Wrong again. I have only used it two times and I feel like I wasted my money. I love her other videos and feel like I have worked out when doing the others. Not with this one. I don't want to use this video as my workout video because I don't feel like I'll get a good enough workout from it. I hope Kathy comes out with a new, normal, video soon. Don't let us down again."
3,or maybe three and a half...,"I was apprehensive about what I might get with this video since some of the previous reviews were so widely varied. I found a little bit of both extremes to be true. The video was fun and different, and 40 minutes went by before I knew it. However, I workout daily, so the cardio wasn't too exhilirating. The steps are really fun to do and you can learn the basic ones really fast. But the other viewers are right: Kathy Smith's cueing stinks. The steps are too fast to follow if you're not familiar with dance terminology. And Kathy never breaks a sweat in her little pink twinset, which i find a little irritating. Great for a light workout or to polish up your Latin moves before a night of dancing, but not a heart-pumping workout for those familiar with aerobics or even jogging."
2,Not that great...,"I was disappointed with the video. It was difficult to follow Kathy because she just didn't have that ""Latin Rhythm"" You get used to following the beat and suddenly she is slightly off beat and that throws you off. Her companions were easier to follow because they had more rhythm. I did eventually work up a slight sweat but it still left me wanting more!"
2,What a dissapointment.......,"Well, my title say's it all, what a dissapointment. What you think your getting, you don't get at all. To keep my review as ""to the point"" as possible, this looked like an amature video. First of all, they are wearing black pants in a dim studio so therefore it is really hard to see exactly what they are doing with there legs and feet. Secound, Kathy is all over the place with her movements and not in a benificial position for the viewer at times. There were times where she would introduce a new movement, and the camera wasn't even on her. She almost at times looked like she had forgotten that she was suposed to be ""teaching"" this routine. There are also moments where she had forgoten in the original taping to que a new movement, so you will here an overhead of her voice, which is just so amature and cheap. I give this video 2 stars because it is not worth more then 2 dollars."
2,Disappointing,"I found this tape disappointing and below Kathy's usual high standards. It wasn't much of a workout and unless you're a dancer, it's rather difficult to master the steps. I hope Kathy goes back to putting out her aeobics tapes and gets away from ""trendy"" videos!"
4,difficult yet motivational,"I found the workout to be a bit hard, but its so much fun. It takes some practice to get used to the steps, but thats what makes it motivational.I love this video!"
3,Fun Workout,"This tape has two workouts based on Latin dance styles. It is not hard to pick up the steps. This is a good workout for days when you're not interested in doing more traditional exercises. The male dance instructor has a great smile, and is not bad to look at at! Ms. Smith is her usual upbeat self."
2,Not very good,"Sorry Kathy, this one didn't work for me. I've been a fan of Kathy's for many year's and have many of her video's, but this one disappointed me. The steps were poorly described, and the other dancer's often demonstrated more advanced moves to the dances which made it difficult to keep my attention. Overall, I don't recommend this one unless you want an 'ok' cardio work-out with basic moves to latin rhythms that are hard to follow.Patti"
4,"Very good workout, great for hips, great music!","I've worked out to this video many times now and always have fun and enjoy it. I never knew how tight my hips were until I did this workout - does it ever loosen my hips, which feels great! I think the music is great and it's helped introduce me to latin dancing, although it really isn't true latin dancing. The only complaint I have is that with the outfits that Kathy and everyone is wearing, it's hard to see exactly what they're doing and there are many moves where you work one side, but not the other and I think it's important to do all moves on both sides (right and left) to be balanced. So what I do is follow it exactly as it is on the video once and when I do it the next time, work the opposite side to what Kathy's demonstrating so it can be balanced.I never get tired of this video and always have fun doing it. It is not too difficult, but I still work up a sweat."
2,a deviation from the norm...,"Yes, Kathy Smith has really motivated me in the past, and I give her a lot of credit for her capacity to catch so many fitness trends and make them accessible to those of us who can't get to glitzy gyms.However, this tape really disappointed me. I felt like the workout was really limited to my lower legs, no matter how hard I tried to incorporate the rest of my body, the only part of me that felt worked was my calves. I need a more whole body approach, so I will turn back to Kathy's other workouts. This one is dusty on my shelf..."
4,Sore Muscles the next Day,"I really enjoyed this new-type of video by Kathy Smith. I, too, have several of Kathy's videos in my exercise collection; however, this one was begun and over with before I even realized it. I was having fun working out and didn't even realize the WHOLE 40 minutes was gone by! I even had some tender muscles in my calves and thighs the next day. So, THUMBS UP to you Kathy!"
4,Kathy Smith's Latin Workout,"This workout is perfect for those days when I really don't feel like huffing and puffing through a workout. Days when I know I SHOULD do some kind of exercise, but can't motivate myself for something more exerting. It's a really fun video to do, you don't burn near as many calories, as say a Cathe Friedrich video, but at least it motivates you to move (and isn't that the whole point?)! Steps are really easy to learn, and finally I learned something in a ""dance"" fitness video that I can take to a dance floor. It's one that I probably won't do every day, being an intermediate exerciser, but certainly one I'd do at least once a week, on those days when I'm in a slump. I'd recommend it just for that reason, cause we ALL have those days. I never turn down the opportunity to do this video! Very fun."
3,Classic Kathy with a twist or two.,"I trust Kathy Smith to deliver the most practical and effective workout videos on the market. Trust me. I've tried others and ended up back with Kathy Smith. Her stuff delivers results in an easy to follow format. The only problem with this video work out was me. I am not so coordinated with increasing speed. I personally had to ""wing it"" as the pace picked up. However, if you are coordinated, and can dance, you'll be fine."
3,This was fun.,"This video was definitl FUN! . I didn't feel like I was getting a workout, but I found that if I did a ""real"" workout video, and then put this one in after, it was 20 mins. of Fun. I wouldn't recommend using ONLY this tape, but by combing it with other aerobic tapes, you will have a variety of effective and fun work outs."
2,knee pain,"Two things that I haven't seen mentioned here. Dancing requires a hard floor. It is hard to follow this tape with turns and pivots on carpet. Forget about sneakers. Smooth soles only. Second, the tape is definitely not low impact. One dance requires you to pretend that one leg is shorter. If you follow this tape a couple of times a week and experience knee pain it could inflame them. The other dance steps are equally hard on knees.I also found the retape portions distracting, where Kathy shows up mid sequence in different surroundings (blue floor) and then suddenly switches back to the big group in the dance studio. (wood floor). This could be part of the cueing problem that eveyone refers to. After a while it looks like they are doing the same step for every dance sort of a modified chacha. If you want to jump around to latin music, its a winner!"
3,DON'T BUY IF YOU PLAN TO DO THIS ON CARPET!,"IT WAS A GREAT VIDEO, BUT IF YOU TRY TO DO MANY OF THE STEPS ON CARPET THEY JUST DONT SLIDE. IF YOU HAVE HARD WOOD OR TILED FLOORS YOU SHOULD BE FINE, NO SNEAKERS THOUGH OR YOU WILL BE STICKING, IT IS A FUN WAY TO EXERCISE, IT IS AEROBIC, BUT YOU WILL WANT TO WEAR SOME FLAT TYPE DANCE SHOE."
3,I learned the steps...,"The workout is not that great. However, you will learn the steps & have fun if you like Latin rythms."
3,Could totally do without it,"This is my first Kathy Smith video and I think my last. While the music is fun and encourages you to move, Kathy Smith herself has the opposite effect--she is cold and out-of-place. The workout is not by any means challenging--that was the reason I selected this tape over others. However, if it THAT basic even for someone like me (not a lot of exercise experience, no dancing experience, and not particularly good coordination) and it is not that much fun, then what's the point."
3,"Fun, but not much of a workout","This tape was fun, but I didn't sweat much doing it. Buy it if you want to learn some different dances and have fun, but jump rope for a few minutes afterward to get your heart rate up."
1,Waste of money,"If you are thinking of b) Getting a good workout or a) Learning to latino-dance, pl. look elsewhere. This video will help neither 'coz the dance steps and cueing is pathetic. I am a good dancer otherwise, but wanted to pick up on latino steps. This video has just put me in dis-array as for learning a new dance. I would buy videos dedicated to lessons and workouts separately."
4,Good workout,"I think that this workout was pretty good. Because it didn't FEEL like working out, I didn't think I was doing anything. However, after I found myself out of breath and sweaty, I discovered it is a pretty good workout. It was just that it wasn't boring, which made it different than other videos.My only complaint about this video is that the music was somewhat stale and Kathy yelled too loud. There was only one good song in the dance workout sequence."
2,Near-Complete Failure to Exploit Unbelievable Potential,"This film, with its superlative cast and the terrific book upon which it is based, miserably failed to deliver the depth, richness and impact of that fine book. The actors were just perfect -- Roscoe Rules and Harold Bloomguard, in particular, were portrayed stupendously -- and some of the vignettes came across properly, but in total this movie ended up being a real shame. I read that Joseph Wambaugh wanted to have himself completely dis-associated from the film (which is one reason that the next movie made from a Wambaugh book, The Onion Field, more closely adheres to its source).Read the book, watch this film once (mainly to see how well the actors just NAILED their roles!) and then hope for a remake or, perhaps, a re-edit."
1,What an awful piece of trash,"Imagine the grit of Hill Street Blues and the idiocy of Police Academy mixed mixed up with the drunken rowdiness of Porky's. Don't forget to add in a lot of unlikable cop characters who spend all their time exploiting hookers, insulting minorities, and threatening (even killing) gays. And laughing about it from beginning to end.[I'd give it zero or negative stars if that was possible.]"
4,Please release this movie on DVD!!,I saw this movie fifteen years ago and really enjoyed it. I was wondering when it was going to be released on DVD??
3,Dysfunctional Cops on the Loose !,"This is, indeed, a dark comedy. Portrays a range of behaviors oftentimes associated with law enforcement ranging from bigotry and nastiness to imcompetence to a sincere effort to uphold the law in a noble fashion. Believable acting but, unfortunately, no oscar-winning performances here."
4,choir practice,"the movie is great but the tape needs some improvement, I had to do some intense tracking to be able to watch, once it was tracked (had to run tracking all the way down then up then down and work it back up again) everything was fine."
2,The Choirboys,"As a police officer, I'm offended by this piece of garbage. Joe Wambaugh's outstanding book was turned into an abortion by Hollywood. He never should have sold the rights to his book. I hope a remake will be made someday that will do it justice."
4,"Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan.","The kid was cute, and there were parts of the film which slowed almost to a stop. But Jackie Chan is worth the price of admission and you can't go too wrong with Jackie."
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"I bought this product based on customer reviews,well priced, it arrived well in time but it was too late for me to return it as I had a kids pool party planned and my kids (5 and 7) were looking forward to it.For some reason I had the impression that these guns are powerful enough to blast a lot of water but was let down on that front and also the handles are not ergonomic enough ....kids got tired using it after a few minutes...I would not recommend it"
2,I love it and I hate it,"The guns that worked worked great. However, two of the guns didn't work at all!"
3,it's just ok,"The color of the pan is a positive however I have noticed that it is difficult to press the graham cracker crust into place because the bottom is so flexible- it flexes as I press on the bottom causing it to pop back into place and cracking the crust. I have also found that the edges of the cheesecake cook faster than the middle which causes the cheesecake to be very brown around the edges and very undercooked in the middle. I make cheesecakes for my nieces restaurant (they dip the small cut cheesecake ""bites"" in funnel cake batter and deep fry them) so they don't need to look perfect and this pan gets the job done. If I needed to make a cheesecake that needed to be asthetically pleasing I would invest in a pricier pan but for my purposes it get the job done for a decent price. This pan cleans up easily and the latch works great. If anyone can recommend a nice springform pan that is NOT a dark non stick pan please let me know (basically a nice aluminium springform pan)."
2,Mine leaked,I know a lot of reviewers had success with this for making cheesecake. I made a quiche for a big family brunch and it leaked out of the bottom and set off the fire alarm. The whole ordeal made brunch later and added unneeded stress to the day :(
3,"Great pan, but leakproof? Not so much.","I really like this pan. I use it to make cheesecakes mostly and I specifically bought this pan so the butter wouldn't leak out of the crust as it bakes. This still leaks, so I have to do the foil wrapped bottom.It's annoying, but it's not the end of the world. And I got a red one and it's pretty cute, so no complaint son that."
4,Stands up to the test,"I read 1 million reviews before deciding on this pan. The consensus was that springform pans leak, no matter how much you spend. So I decided to go with this one, which was the America's Test Kitchen best buy. There was not an option to choose the pan color, and I ended up with bright yellow, which I love. If your heart is set on blue, just know you may be disappointed.I have baked a few standard batter cakes and had no problem with leaking. I haven't dared to make a cheesecake in a water bath, which seems to be the springform pans' leaking Waterloo (no pun intended). So if you're not a frequent cheesecake baker, you will probably love this pan as much as I do."
3,"Looks great, cooks fair","This pan is visibly appealing, but my cheesecakes, which always cook perfectly in an aluminum, non-coated pan, now over-cook around the top portion of the edges. I feel that the white, non-stick coating on the interior of the pan is the cause of this. If you are using this pan for ice-cream cakes, it should work fine, but just not as good for cheesecake."
3,For Academics Only,"This book is a compendium of white papers, by academics, of academics and for academics. It discusses ""what"" is Online Teaching, and the authors throw in a few common sense suggestions (although these may seem like revelations to those who don't know Internet Technology well).It is appropriate for secondary and college teachers who are not sophisticated I-Net users. It is not that helpful outside of an academic setting."
3,"Great performance, short CD","No question, one of the better Vivaldi CDs I have. The music making is of the highest standards, very atmospheric and vivid. The recording with great presence, a BIS recording. What is dissapointing is the length of the CD that runs a bit over 40 min. At the time it was first released that may have been acceptable - not anymore."
5,Silicone Cooking,Truely great cooking pan. Cakes pop right out. However note that cooking time and temperature may have to be adjusted. I cooked a cake that I have made over 100 times in an alunimum fluted pan at 350 for 45-50 minutes. In this silicone pan I notice that it cooked much faster and now reduce time to 40 minutes.
1,Stop! Your notes are on THEIR server,"Please note. When you enter your notes on your characters, plot ideas, etc. you are housing your creative ideas on their server. Why is this not on my own computer? I'm afraid they are stealing our ideas to make a story of their own. You have to be hooked up to the internet to even write your novel. This is not ok."
1,Just an organizer....writing is always up to you,"It claims a lot but really is nothing more than the same thing I do in MS Word. It's not intuitive at all. It actually takes more time to figure out than save you time. No tabs, no spell check, etc. The refund policy is hard to find. I looked. I threw it into the garbage. I just wanted it to organize my characters and it barely could do that but with longer printing that I do with MS Word. Junk software."
1,It refuses to save new entries!,"I bought the first version, which is basically an organizer, as other reviewers have said. I liked it for my purposes and was quick to buy the updated version when it was released. The problem with the newer version is that it refused to save any new entries I made. With neither of them did I figure out how to transfer text to my MS Word documents. I e-mailed the manufacturer with the problem and was told that it mysteriously did that with some computers and there was no way to fix it. They refunded my money promptly, and that was the best part of my experience with this software. I do not recommend it."
5,Wow,"I have been trying to write a true story for years, I am not a writer, so this a first and only book. This program u.locked writers block. In two hours, I received the online download for $51, and finished through chapter two. Pages are flying. I can edit and ad d pictures later.Thank you New Novelist !"
1,not useable,I agree with the other review who gave it 2 stars. text editor is worthless. No spell check. No word count. whats the point
3,Interesting!,"A little confusing. Need to be patient to learn how it all works. Helpful. Interesting.However, it may not be your way of writing a book. But that is okay."
1,Not practical.,"This software ""New Novelist"" is not at all practical for anyone who is trying to write. It also does not run well with Vista. I definitely would not recommend it to anyone. What it mainly lacks is the ability to see and put all the information you entered together. It's more like hide and seek or out of sight, out of mind. I tried to print what I wrote so I could peice it together on paper but it didn't have the ability to conform to my needs. Sorry! Just not realistic.L Laverriere, Amazon customer"
4,One of my Best Online Purchases,"I work as a professional copywriter and have a lot of usage of scripts and copywriting material.I am now thinking of a storyline for a book I want to write and found newnovelist software on Amazon which I thought may help me out.This software is really fun to work with, and exciting too as it enables me to formulate my thoughts and provides lots of ideas on improving the storyline. I thought I had everything planned perfectly until I started to use newnovelist. I found so many new ways of thinking about the structure and outline of my book and now feel that it has improved my writing immeasurablyDelivery was swift and I sincerely cannot put a price on how much it has helped me with my masterpiece.I would recommend this software to anyoneD.Broadrick"
1,Inferior Product & Customer Service,"Do not bother to buy this product if you are running Windows Vista, especially on a new PC with a 64 bit operating system. I emailed the company prior to purchase to make sure it would run on my PC. They would not say whether or not it would work on my PC or not, just that if it did not, they offer a money-back guarantee.How could I lose, right? Where is my money? The money-back guarantee turned out to be only as good as their word, which was worthless. I am now out $60 for software I cannot use. All I can do now is warn other potential buyers to stay away from this product."
4,musical spoons,"Catpaws wooden spoons are so much fun. I love the feel and sound of the hardwood. Nice work by the artisan! Highly recommended for beginners and experienced spoons players. They are a little heavier than traditional metal spoons, but so easy to use, that makes up for the weight difference."
5,Great BBQ Substitute!!,"Recently I switched to a low carb diet and was in search of a BBQ sauce substitute. During my search I was afraid I would never find something as tasty as a full sugar sauce. Especially after hearing horror stories of watery sauce that turns meat purple!! Well, to my delight I stumbled across Smokin' Joe Jones BBQ sauce which is full of flavor, thick, and is the color BBQ sauce should be. It is a tad on the pricey side, but well worth the price if you are a lover of BBQ sauce and are afraid you will have to exclude it from your new low carb lifestyle. I highly recommend this sauce to anyone looking to add flavor to their new eating regime."
2,BBQ...I don't think so!,"Taste is ok but it does not BBQ well, it dries up and flakes off making the food look disgusting.Maybe ok as a dip but i havent tried that yet."
2,Just okay,"This product was only okay. The sauce is not quite as sweet as I like, and don't leave it in the oven on the meat for more than 2 or 3 minutes, it dries and gets sticky."
3,Good for a low carb alternative- but not like the real thing,"The taste is acceptable; however, I doubt that this product would be popular if it was not low carb. It is not as good as several (many?) of the non- low carb sauces."
1,Boaz Brown,"I found this book to very boring and repetitive with the reference to religion, racism, and irrelevant flashbacks that the story got lost. In fact, the book's jacket is very misleading. I thought it was suppose to be a love story when it really has nothing to do with the romance between LaShondra and Stelson, but basically about LaShondra problems with her own her religious belief and racism."
4,Believable romance,"I really liked this book. The male lead was strong withouth being an alpha male. The romance was paced , which was good because you can see how they fall in love with each other. A sweet romance."
3,3 1/2: Recommend Reading,I love a good Christian Fiction book. I think the premise of the book was thought provoking and I enjoyed watching the couple's courtship. It's nice to see a representation of what happens when things are done God's way.I found myself skipping some of the chapter pre-ludes. I know that had a purpose but for some reason I was not interested after reading a few of them.I definitely recommend this book.
4,Great book with twists,"I read this book years ago, yet I still remember many of its details. That's how great this book was. It just goes to show the reader, no mater what level your career/social/economic status is, God will give you just what you need. It may not be what is expected, but it will be great and you will be extremely happy. The young lady had no idea what tremendous blessing God had in store for her. Her Boaz was not what she expected, but was exactly what she needed. Enjoy the book."
4,"""Everyone Black, White and Brown Should Read This Book!!!""","Boaz Brown by Michelle Stimpson was a very knowledgeable read. Everyone black, white and brown should read this book. I was confronted with racial issues within myself that I did not know existed. Great job Mrs. Stimpson!"
5,"Excellent Book, Brilliantly Written",I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I will be purchasing other titles by Michelle Stimpson.
5,Wonderful Read!,"I absolutely adored this book. I was so glad to finally read a good romance story that was truly Christ-centered. The characters were not just labeled as Christian, but it was wonderful to read about the steps they took to continually develop their relationship with Christ. Also, I must say that I fell in love with Stelson Brown and hope that God sends me someone like that because, girl, he was all that! I too can't believe that this is Michelle Stimpson's debut novel and I can't wait to read more...especially a sequel!!"
4,Love In All Colors,"LaShondra seemingly has it all - a wonderful career, a strong family and a confidence in herself, yet she has been on a roller coaster ride in the love arena. When she commits her life over to Christ, she confesses that she is looking for her Boaz - a man to love her and treat her like a queen. When Boaz himself comes knocking on her door, LaShondra has to conduct a deep self-examination because she never thought her Boaz would be of another race.BOAZ BROWN confronts racial prejudice in the face and subtly provides its readers with a Christian message of love and acceptance. It examines familial values and provides an account of how deep seeded our believes really are. Kudos to Ms. Stimpson on her debut novel. I look forward to her future works."
4,"Lush, well arranged ,beautifully produced serious music !!","All in all Jeff's a serious songwriter with a serious attitude towards album production. Cellos ! Violins ! Flutes ! Upright bass !The musician credits sound almost like an orchestra ensemble. However they seem to blend in well with Jeff's songs,in this self produced collection of mostly slow to mid tempo bitter-sweet ballads. Some beautiful guitar work by Mr.Talmadge & Brian Wood as well as the rest of the guitarists. Damned good stuff!"
3,Pillow - don't know yet.,I have arthritis in my neck and got this pillow to help. So far I haven't been able to inflate to the perfect size... will keep working with it as it feels good and supportive.
3,tow trailer,"Good quality tires. Children enjoy having a trailer to tow. Did not come with a bolt to attach trailer to bike. Easily resolved, but inconvenient. Worth the trouble."
2,Another Reebok shoe with a tongue that has a thick seam,"I've been wearing Reebok for years and all I can say is: What Happened? Reebok used to be made so well. To replace my old pair, I've now gone through 10 different Reeboks (expecting at least one would be like the old shoes I used to buy and love). Each pair is so cheaply made that they are not wearable. My biggest complaint is how the tongue is fastened. Instead of the smooth transition, the latest model shoes, including this one, all have a big seam and overlapping material that rubs on the top of the foot. I used to wear a size 7 and have recently upgraded to 7.5. This pair of 7.5 is way too small to fit on my foot. And to think I am still wearing my old pair of 7's that I am trying to replace. I wore Reebok for 15 yrs, but now I am moving on to other brands and I won't be wasting any more time with these cheaply made running shoes."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I love the works of Caitlin and John Matthews, so I jumped at this deck, purchasing it sight unseen. Opening the box was a terrible disappointment. As it turns out, their only contribution was to write the forword of the book. The artwork is colorful in the Matthews tradition, but simple and vague. Even the quality of the card stock was less than what I expected. If I had seen the deck open in a store, I probably would have saved my money for something else."
4,Great Snacks for Travel or Work,"I like these bars and don't think that the molasses flavor is too heavy. Sesame seeds are relatively mild in flavor, but the combination of molasses and sesame is pretty good. Each package contains three flat sticks (sort of like oversized sticks of gum). An entire package is about 270 calories; however, it's possible to eat just a portion and put the rest into a plastic bag for later. The sesame seeds are calorie-dense foods and the molasses adds some iron to the nutrition mix. These keep pretty well and are good for travel, hiking, or just taking to work. The downside is that the bars do break easily so they tend to get messy. On one hand, that's good if you just want to eat a small piece; on the other hand, you probably won't receive too many unbroken ones in the box."
2,Too sweet!,Not what I'd hoped. The sweet taste from the molasses totally overshadows the taste/flavor of the sesame seeds. May as well call it molasses bars with a hint of sesame oil.
3,Not Real Excited about this one....,"I'm a relatively young intern studying for my P.E. Exam. This book was written quite a while ago, I'm thinking, and the problems seem a little further advanced from the typical P.E. test prep books I have. I'd be happy to sell it to you myself, if you'd think you'd want a more advanced set of problems to review."
3,This book is out of date.,"This book is out of date. NCEES updated its structural design standards November 1, 2007, effective with the April 2008 examinations. The updates include IBC 2006, ASCE 7-05, ACI 318 2005, AISC 13th edition, PCI 2004, and NDS 2005 codes. Any questions referencing the out of date codes may be incorrect. The AASHTO code which NCEES now uses (3rd ed. 2004 w/2005 and 2006 revisions) is already out of date but is what the exam references."
4,Steel and Concrete,As a sn strc. eng. I think that is one of the good ref. or sample solve problem book
3,No good for Structural I SE,"With the new format of the Structural I SE Exam, which is multiple choice, I don't think that book is that much useful. The nex format has a short problems which you excpect you to finish each within tw minutes and does not require al ot of calculations."
5,A wonderful genius,"This is truly moving and profound music by the wonderful but still not very well known genius William Lawes. You can find here both the highest level of contrapuntal skill, on par with such masters of polyphony as Byrd, Gibbons or Bach, and a unique ""cavalier' spirit, quite unlike anything I have ever heard elsewhere. The performance is superb. I have two other versions of these works, performed by Fretwork and Phantasm, which are both excellent but don't quite move me the way Savall and Hesperion do. Out of well over 2000 ""classical"" CDs I own this certainly is one of my 10 ""desert island"" favorites."
1,don't buy this!,"i bought one for a gift and was embarassed when my friend opened it and the CAST IRON pan was broken. maybe they dropped it from an airplane, but i don't know how you break cast iron... and now i cannot find a replacement one, just in case this one was defective."
3,Outdoor Life Magazine,"OL does a pretty good job, but the articles are often re-runs of articles posted in previous years. Seems they recycle their articles as the writer often lack imagination."
4,Great Magazine for All types of Hunter,"I really enjoy reading this one. It has great reviews of gear (guns, bows, optics, knives, clothing, etc...) and doesnt seem to favor one type of hunting over the others. Some of the other magazines Ive read are mostly one type (Fishing, etc...) This one is well rounded.They do a graet job on their product reviews and are very thorough with providing their readers the data they got from their tests after reviewing a particular product. They have some good articles on hunting as well as tips and tricks,"
1,I do knot know?,I have not recieved any issues as of this time 12/29/12I have yet to recieve my first copy and therefore can not give you an opinion of this magazine
2,no duplicates please,I like the convenience that automatic renewals give but an automatic renewal should continue the magazine subscription. An automatic renewal should eliminate the possibility of duplicate magazines. I received 2 copies of the November issue. This is a waste of the consumer's money.
1,Cheap feel,The paper quality and thinness of the magazine makes it difficult to take seriously. Just feels like a free coupon book that hard to imagine that it has interesting or valuable contents.The substance of the articles are mediocre. Considering cancelling the subscription.
1,Dont want it,Dont like or want it canceled last month no refend very upset.item says cancellation still being processes for about 2 months now .
1,Used to be Better,"I doubt I'll renew my subscription to this magazine. It seems like there were a lot of real bad articles in the magazine and all the better writers that they used to have are no longer writing for them like Jim Zumbo, Pat McManus and others."
5,a great book.,"This is a one of a kind book for anyone with type 1 diabetes.It teaches how to do carbohydrate counting, how to account for exercise, illness, and unexpected highs and lows.I hope the authors write an updated version of this book because it is really necessary. It is surprising that there are so few books like this available to diabetics who really have to take care of their disease all by themselves. It is lonely out there and books like this really help."
3,Needs updating,"This book would have been EXCELLENT several years ago, but it apparently was written before Humalog becamse available and doesn't include this very useful insulin in the control techniques. As a result, it is not very useful. A Second Edition with all the latest techniques would be very worthwhile."
5,Great book,"This is a great book for figuring out which colors go best with each other, however it's not really a ""workbook"" per se. Although I was a little disapponted about that, I'll still give this book 5 stars because the color combinations are spectacular."
3,Confused,It's not the kind of book I expected but it is still useful to plan a color scheme. Oh well...
3,ROLA Cargo Box,"ROLA 59109 Adventure System Cargo Carrier,Rola 59109 Adventure System with Swing AwayI purchased this carrier about 4 month ago. It leaks badly. I have lost several items carried in the box when it had 1-2"" of water in it. The hassle of all the wet items was not very exciting. This has happened on two different occasions. The concept is great and I hoped for something that was reliable. Too bad, I really hoped it would meet my needs considering its fairly high cost."
4,Great for beginners!,"This video is simply a taped recording of the construction of two dollhouses from start to finish. It looks like a home movie in its simplicity, and demonstrates clearly how easy it is to begin making dollhouses without the need for expensive tools or a lot of woodworking skills.The first segment demonstrates the construction of a simple starter dollhouse, and the second segement the construction of a larger, more complex dollhouse. This video is a great place to start for those considering building a dollhouse and those who are beginning their first one."
5,A Great CD,I love this CD. Tom is the best singer alive. You won't be disappointed if you buy this CD.
4,Good Family Entertainment.,"This is a simple story, and it is sometimes silly. But it is family-safe and entertaining. The characters appear to be recycled from other movies, and it is somehow predictable. But the story moves smoothly and evenly, so that it keeps a good level of interest. Overall, it is a good family movie."
3,Mediocre,"Some parts are fun, others tiresome. The voice acting leaves something to be desired. Some of the humor is a little more inappropriate than I would have expected for this genre of movie. Probably better as a rental than a buy."
3,Could be better,"Not bad, but the premise was more exciting than the actual movie. It's on the premium channels from time to time - if you have these channels, watch it there, don't buy it outright. I didn't hate it, it just wasn't a movie I'd watch twice. Not good enough for that."
2,Nothing special,"This movie was nothing special, which is too bad because it had such a great premise. I thought they could've done a lot more with the human/alien role reversal. I caught a few of the throwbacks such as Star Wars and E.T., but it wasn't enough to carry the movie.Kind of slow, and (maybe it's just me) there seemed to be awkward pauses during some of the dialogue, like they should have taken out a second or half second of silence between lines in the conversations.I thought the general was waaaaay too one-dimensional. He had no thought process, and was practically a zombie prior to the astronaut's arrival.It's one-and-done for me; saw it, and probably won't ever again."
3,MY GRADE: B minus to B,"A fun movie that adults who have watched SciFi movies will appreciate. There are many inside references to the old and new movies. Kids won't get them so much but the story is fun enough to keep them involved. It's a what if a race of green aliens were just like humans in the 1950s and had fears of ""aliens"" eating their brains, controlling their minds and other creepy actions. Rampant themes of prejudice and how a society can destroy itself by obsessing over its fears. Notable voices by Dwayne Johnson, Jessica Biel, Justin Long, Gary Oldman, Seann William Scott, and John Cleese. This expensive movie (by the standards of Spain where it was produced) had a budget of $70M and yielded a bit over $105M at the Box Office.ANIMATION: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus;SCI FI FOCUSES: B plus; HUMOR: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: early May 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B."
3,Planet 51,Planet 51 is an ok animated movie that is about an astronaut named Chuck Baker that comes to a planet and on this planet the aliens live like America in the 50's. The story line is alright but the love story between Lem and Neera is just kind of boring and predictable. The animation is ok but nothing that one has not seen in many other movies as of late. I give it 3/5.
3,Planet 51,"The product arrived just as quickly as any other product from Amazon. Because it is a Christmas gift, I have not watched the dvd yet."
2,Definitely rent first.,"My son's grandmother took him to see it in the theater. He fell asleep, she said he liked it though.He got excited when I told him I'd buy it the day it came out. It's been out for 3-4 weeks and he still hasn't watched it. Had his friends over who hadn't seen it, they wanted it on. He wouldn't sit and watch it with them. They seemed disinterested after awhile too and would join him on the floor away from the tv to play with toys too.My son is 4 and his friends go are from 6-9. I'd give it a one star, but I haven't seen more than the first 15-20 minutes. What I saw wasn't objectionable, but I could see why it didn't hold their attention.I also never saw more than the first 15-20 minutes of G-Force, I would put these two movies in same category."
3,My first cloud video.,Bought this for my 4 year old grand nephew. It held his attention about 50 percent of the time. The animation is great. The story line is 1950 flying saucer invasion with a twist. The Jokes designed for adults were a little lame.
4,Cute Movie,Cute movie for young kids. Whenever I have young kids come over the house I put this on and it entertains them. The animation is awesome and the aliens are cute. Good family friendly movie.
5,Loved the Movie.,Great movie for the kids and grandkids. it is a fun movie and worked well in my Blue-Ray Player. The movie is really funny and entertaining as well.
1,Morons In Outer Space...and in the Animation Studios!,"This film is no ""little gem"" of animation, so I've edited my review to reflect how I really feel. The animation is very good indeed...pity it's wasted here. This is one of the dumbest films I've ever seen, and that is saying something regarding animation. Usually there has to be a degree of dumb. So what I say is: this movie is stupid. It brought back memories of only one thing: Tom Paris playing Captain Proton or whatever inStar Trek Voyager - The Complete Fifth Season. I wish I could give PLANET 51 NO stars plus a stinking diaper or something like that."
1,Boring and no RENT option,"[...]This movie is BORING. My 4 year old really wanted to watch it. He got bored and wandered off in the first 30 minutes. I couldn't stomach to watch the rest. Monsters vs. Aliens was a better movie.Unless you like really boring movies, don't get this one."
1,Not For Young Children,I took my 8year old and friend to see this. It was hard to sit through the entire movie.It was:1. Boring2. Not funny - very few laugh out loud moments2. References to subject matter way over a child's head3. A couple of inappropriate referencesI will not be buying this movie...ever.
1,...,"I still have not recieved my DVD, this was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my son, I dont think I will be using Amazon again."
2,Planet 51 (2009),Awful. It was not to good of a movie. It was what I expected - dumb. Seann William Scott (American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)) might as well be in the American Pie straight to DVD movies (American Pie Presents: The Threesome Pack) because this movie wasn't good. The beginning is predictable and over-used. It is obvious what is going to happen.If you want a movie about Aliens then seeMonsters vs. Aliens [Blu-ray] because this movie (Planet 51) is no good.DVD Features:TBA
1,Took My Money but didn't deliver the DVD,It is now 6-24-2010 - Ordered this DVD on 5-22-10 - Neverreceived. Good Quicks Books is now being investigated bymy credit card company to see who charged my card and neverdelivered the product. Also submitted a claim to Amazon.Buyer Beware - this shipper will not respond or send yourpurchase. I emailed this shipper 5 times. I have to crossAmazon off my list to purchase anything until I get mymoney back. My trust is gone.
2,Planet 51 blu ray,This blu ray version from this particular vendor looks like it's a bootleg. The quality is just terrible for being blu ray.
5,Excellent movie! Very funny!,"This is a great family film, definitely a must see! If you want to enjoy a fun filled evening with the family, this is the movie that you need!"
3,My least favorite animated film,"Sure I laughed here and there, but that was it. The movie had potential of being a great film, but it turned out to be a huge flop. Now I see why it is selling for so cheap, for the price I picked it up for, it was worth it. I feel bad for whoever payed retail when this came out. Not even the young ones enjoyed it!"
4,Cute movie,My whole family enjoyed this movie; underlying adult humor and 50's era made it really cute. Would highly recommend to all age groups.
2,not so great,"A fun retro look, but the constant sarcastic tone and unending supply of adults-only jokes will make this hard for kids to enjoy.1. The fact that the movie is pretty much one extended chase scene gets quite trying.2. This thing is chock-full of so many references to other sci-fi movies and books it's distracting."
2,Meh.,"I was super excited for this to arrive. Unfortunately when it arrived, it tasted ashy. Like the way a fire just put out by water smells."
2,Not up to par,"While this is a very attractive watch - rec'd several compliments and I liked it as well - I returned it because in less than one week the analog time lost 10 seconds. I thought this was an unacceptable rate for a watch of this price. Digital readouts can be impossible to read since, at times, they are partly covered by the minute hand. Countdown was worthless! It ONLY counts down to a specific date - you can't set for example, a 5 minute countdown. You can only set it to alert to midnight of a specified date. Due to the metal wristband it is somewhat heavy (if that's a concern - it didn't bother me). One thing I noticed as soon as I took it out of the box, the case is very nicely sized - not huge like other multifunctionals from Seiko and others."
3,"Good review, but out of date?","The content of the review was good, but the actual SAT2 test in 2011 has some significant differences - a major section in this prep book was not on the SAT2 and the sections themselves were organized differently."
4,Lekue Silicone 6 Cup Mufflin Pan,"This is a nice muffin pan. Deeper than I expected -- and can make pop-overs as well. I'm new to silicone and wasn't crazy about the slight smell it had while baking. I did use cooking spray with first use and it didn't stick. Super easy to clean -- that was really great! My favorite use for this is with freezing chicken stock. I just pour the hot stock directly in and place it on a half cookie sheet in my freezer. It is extremely easy to get the soup out when I need it -- and no more little plastic cups for this! Easy storage, too, makes this a plus!"
4,THis movie is available,Such a great Disney movie! I had a VHS copy and recently replaced it with a copy I found at the Disney Channel movie club. Available and under $20.00!I wish Disney would release these classics more widely to the public!
1,Unsatisfied,I did not realize I ordered the incorrect region. I will be returning this. It does not play on American DVD players.
5,Always So Dear To My Heart,"I was in first grade when a special preview of a new Walt Disney movie was shown at a special auditorium session in my elementary school...I remember being enthralled with the message of the movie...but being 7 years old I could never remembered the name of it ........ as I grew (older) I always remembered the special movie about a little black lamb and the little boy named Gerry (my name also) who raised him...When I became a mother and old movies were being released to the public on VHS I hoped this movie would somehow pop up so I could show my children...and one day it was..(I recognized the description of the little black lamb)..Such a sweet movie with an important message for children of all ages...without a double meaning...just pure love and obedience and forgiveness,....Parents and grandparents would give your children and grandchildren a gift of lovely memories watching this special film....that will always be So Dear To My Heart"
4,Filled with valuable lessons................,"We borrowed this from the library. Although it has cartoon sequences with live action I think that this movie appeals more to the older child and adults. The scenery is beautiful. The cartoons are great with wonderful songs. The actors are great also. Burl Ives does a wonderful job as Uncle Hiram. His natural, effortless, singing ability jumps up through out the film.The story is about a young boy being raised by his grandmother in the early 1900's. His dreams of owning a champion race horse change when a black lamb is born and is not accepted by its mother. Jeremiah soon falls in love with the lamb and dreams of taking him to the state fair. Without any extra money for train fare Jeremiah must raise money to pay his way.Strong emphasis placed on faith in God and doing the best with what you got."
5,Gift,"This is a Disney Classic and the Author of the story Sterling North, was a well knownwriter .""So Dear To My Heart"", is a perfect movie for this Holiday season.We have a friend whose family knew Mr. North quite well, and so we decided to get this dvdas a gift for her."
5,One of the best family movies!!,"So Dear To My Heart is a great family movie! It is pure and inocent with nothing bad about it. This movie is the story of a young boy and his pet lamb, and tells how, with lots of love, ""things turn out in the end!"" END"
3,Get it legitimately,Disney has released So Dear to my Heart as a Disney Movie Club exclusive title listed at 19.99 or you can get it free with 550 points on the Disney Movie Rewards site. I just wish they would do the same with Song of the South!
2,So Dear To My Heart,"In all the years I've done business over the net this is my first bad review. I received it in good time, the video itself was good but there was gummy, grimy dirt all over the front cover.It did clean up but it left me with bad first impression."
3,Someone Left The Cake out in the Rain,"My daughter and I saw this on cable a year ago and realized there is a segment that image for image would seem to be the inspiration for the trippy 60's song MacArthur Park, Even the cake out in the rain is there! This could be a secret bonus for aging boomers like me who enjoyed playing Pink Floyd while watching the Wizard of Oz! Enjoy!Chris Browne"
1,"Blurred display, Low cost, Low performance","I returned this product after 5 days because of unacceptable blurriness of the display. Installation was quick. Had to download/install latest driver from their website. The device recognized the LCD monitor and everything worked fine except the quality of display. The display was very blurred. Word, Explorer and anything with text was too blurred to be able to use this display."
3,*Almost* Unbearably Slow,"I have two monitors at work and found it difficult to switch between that and my one-monitor laptop at home. This definitely lets my laptop use two monitors like it has two graphics cards, but the one plugged into the Tritton was so.....incredibly.....slow......It was tricky to type email, hard to use Dreamweaver, and I didn't even try using Photoshop (but I do put the Photoshop pallets in the window). In short, would be good for laptop users without a 2nd graphics port, but if you have a desktop, crack open the case and get a 2nd video card."
3,Glitches and issues,It works and i have three screens but it has compatibility issues that even my IT Dept can't correct.I will try to make it work.
5,Tritton - add an additional Display Unit to your PC.,I was amazed at the ease of connecting and using this device to add a 3rd display unit to my business PC. This unit has worked flawlessly and I would hiughly recommed to anyone needing to add an additional display to their PC.
4,Perfect for what I needed,"Installing the software proved to be difficult for an unknown reason. My PC did not like reading the CD, but it got through it, albeit slowly. The reviews I read indicated the product could not display fast moving video/graphics very well. This is accurrate. As long as you don't plan on using the extra moniter for gaming, this is the best/cheapest option for expanding your desktop. I just make sure to watch all my videos on my primary screen. I am very satified with my purchase and I believe you will be as well."
1,DOES NOT SUPPORT WINDOWS VISTA!!!,"I mistakenly purchased this item hoping to use it with my Windows Vista laptop. Don't do that! The tech support case that I registered to simply ask when they expected to have a Windows Vista driver went unanswered for over a week. Good thing I stopped waiting for an answer after about three days. Thus far, the only Windows Vista compatible device that I have found for using more than one monitor with my laptop is the Matrox Dual and Triple Head2Go devices. I am using a DualHead2Go right now, but I really wish I purchased a triple. What I didn't think about when buying the less expensive DualHead2Go is that the center of my screen (where most messages default to appear) is right at the split between two monitors. The TripleHead2Go would not have the same problem as it uses three screens as one, so the center would be in the center of the center screen (instead of divided between two screens as in the Dual)."
3,Add a monitor,"Seems when hooked up and using that monitor, mouse seems sluggish and hard to move in certain programs that appear on the second monitor hooked to this port."
5,Great product. Does what is expected.,"I was able to install the software and plug it in in less than 5 minutes and everything is working great! To adjust the resolution you have to right click on the icon and choose the correct resolution. I use it for work and wanted a second monitor. My computer does not have any slots for a VGA adapter so this was a great solution. I didn't run any movies or games so I don't know how it performs. I have a feeling it will run fine too ... but for regular editing work (MS word, browsing internet etc.) is great."
4,Good enough for me,There are some rather severe bandwidth issues that occur when converting data from USB to VGA but this little device does the best it can. Getting really high frame rates and resolution is a nigh impossibility but this converter will get the job done. I added my third monitor at 1280x1024 and it works fine. It browses and does office work without a problem. It also runs YouTube quality videos just fine. Anything other kind of video results in some frame rate loss. I tried to open up an HD movie on it and the thing crashed on me. It supports at least 16bit color up to 1280x1024. Higher resolutions it will recommend lower color settings. And it works really well for the 1024x768 resolution.Be sure you get the new drivers because they promise support up to 1600x1200. If you want to add and extra monitor but lack the extra VGA or DVI ports this is the way to. It will work fine unless you are gaming or running HD videos on it.
4,Abe Lincoln in Illinois,This is a good movie. I'm glad Warners is releasing some of these titles that haven't been released to DVD.
1,Don't buy it here!,"Five star movie, selling on here for a one star price. This movie can now be purchased on the WBshop for $17.99 NEW. If you know nothing about WBshop, I suggest going to Turner Classic Movies Web site, you can find all 150 titles recently released through Warner Bros. That is where I buy them. I hope you will find this review helpful, and beware those out for a quick buck. IF YOU ALLREDY HAVE THE VHS TAPE DON'T BUY IT, THE QUALITY IS NOT BETTER. NONE OF THE 150 ""WB ARCHIVE COLLECTION"" TITLES THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED THUS FAR HAVE BEEN RESTORED, SO IF YOU ALLREADY HAVE THE VHS TAPES OF MANY OF THE FILMS RELEASED JUST STICK WITH THEM."
3,"Entertaining, but some important inaccuracies","""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" is an entertaining, old-fashioned family film that is tough to dislike. Raymond Massey definitely resembles Mr. Lincoln. However, Massey's portrayal of a passive, reluctant, easily led Lincoln is off the mark. The real Lincoln was highly ambitious and much more confident in himself than this movie depicts. He also loved the world of politics. Also, I think Mary Lincoln is treated too harshly in this film. Mary was high-strung, could be difficult at times, and was ambitious for her husband. But this film portraying her as a cold she-devil was a bit extreme. Mary truly loved Abraham Lincoln. All you have to do is read their correspondence over the years."
3,Lincoln in Illinois,I wanted to use this movie in a class that I teach for senior citizens but found that it does not have English subtitles so therefore cannot use it. Many in the class have hearing problems and so the subtitles are a necessity.
5,Hasker on God's Knowledge and Temporality,"Hasker's work is lucid, philosophically precise and written well. He provides a helpful overview of the debate concerning future contingents, and he brings up a number of original arguments that seem to impugn the notion of God's atemporality. Hasker asks whether a timeless God can directly know His creatures. It does not seem that He can. Hasker therefore seems to opt for a God that actually changes in a relational sense. This God is the God of the OT and NT. Buy Hasker's work; its worth the money."
5,I learned a lot about a fascinating TV talk show host,Ben Alba captures the real essence of Steve Allen's talent and how important he was to the Tonight Show. I learned so much about the whole Tonight Show format and what made it so imporatnt to America's TV culture. Ben Alba is a captivating and clever writer.Steve Allen's contributions to late night television are delivered with great writing which flows across generations. This is a book for many adult age groups. I highly recommend it.
2,Not well written.,"While this book contains some interesting information about Allen and his pioneering television work, it is mostly a mish-mash of stories that are not written particularly well. And I must admit that when I read one particular anecdote -- about Mrs. Sam Snead's inadvertent double entendre to Allen during a broadcast -- I began to wonder just how inaccurate the book might be. The story has also been told about Mrs. Arnold Palmer and Johnny Carson, and the urban legends web site Snopes.com says that it's not a true story. If the author of this book included urban legends, one wonders just what parts of the book are true and what parts are made up."
5,Saluting the Father of Late Night TV,"""Ben's book is a very human look at Steve Allen and the many talented individuals that pioneered the early days of television. I highly recommend this book that serves as a tribute to the father of late night-Steverino!""If you are even remotely interested in the evolution of late night television, this book is a must-read."
2,Serious Nikon fans,I found this book not very interesting. Nothing depth about Nikon. Those are old stuffs that we found any where in Nikon sites. It is a well organize with some information good for a Nikon starter but not for serious fans. We know and we seen almost all of it . The author just pull bits and pieces together and I found no NEWS kind of bore. Good presentation for all information and a heavy book
4,enlightened pornography,"This novel proves that all the enlightened hub bub surrounding the great dead white thinkers, such as Rousseau, Voltaire, and Montesquieu is hogwash. The masses in the late 18th century were not reading these great minds. (...) The masses could not and did not want to get their hands on the now famous intellectual writers of their time. They wanted this explicit pornography to read. These books passed censors because they supposedly contained works of philosophy. This is what the commoners were reading and thus the enlightened heroes of this time priod probably did not have a direct effect on the French Revolution."
3,Not So Good,"I was an absolute beginner. I had never done Yoga before, so I thought that this would be a good place to start. However, I was wrong. I found that the flexibility of Kathy Smith somehow discouraged me. It is a hard workout and you must do it on a regular basis to actually get any results. I would think that for a beginners video, it should have been shorter and not so intense."
4,Great if you are a total beginner,"If you are already in decent shape this is a good tape for beginners to Yoga. I tried Yoga about a year ago on a tape for ""beginners"" and it was soooo difficult and they used so many props that I was very discouraged and quit. I decided to try another tape since I can't afford Yoga lessons. This tape is not too difficult if you are already in good health and in shape from exercising and it stretches your muscles and relaxes you. Don't use this as a way to lose weight - this is basically just for reflection, relaxation, balance and stretch and is great to be used in combination with aerobic workouts. You will need a mat, a blanket, a chair, a towel and a belt. It lasts about 55 minutes but goes very quickly."
5,I will use this one again,"This is a very good DVD's for a beginner. This DVD starts lying on the ground with abdominal breathing exercises and then moves on to stretches (knees to chest etc) and then twist (knees to ground etc.)This is bit different than most yoga DVD's start, but I like the change. The practice starts out with a more relaxed and calm atmosphere.Then on to hands and knee poses (Cat-Cow, knees to chest) and then standing. There are only a few standing poses (high lunge, side-angle, forward bend with a chair, etc) but they are held long enough so you can feel the effect of the pose.It ends again on the floor with forward bends and relaxation. Beginners will learn about posture, foot placement, breath work and alignment. The total workout is about 1 hour and is well cued, expertly demonstrated and has a person to the right who modifies most moves. You will need a chair, strap, and or wall available to complete the practice. Very nice"
3,Pretty Good,"This was the first yoga workout I purchased. Kathy does an excellent job of cueing and explaining the poses. There are two other people on the set with Kathy who demonstrate different levels of flexibility (i.e. for beginners & more advanced students). I also enjoyed the ""background music"" on this video. The workout is solid, and Kathy keeps it interesting without being boring. I have two criticisms, however. First, there is no warm-up on this tape---which I consider strange, since most other yoga tapes do. Two, some basic equipment is needed, which is not listed on the outer packaging (a strap and a couple of blankets are suggested. I used a man's tie or a belt until I was able to purchase a strap). If neither of these last two points would bother you, then this you might really like this video."
3,look nice but not true to size,they seemed a good four inches smaller than on the tag. I will keep them for when i drop the weight this Fall.
1,Horrible Fit - Too tight around thighs,These may be the absolutely worst fitting dress pants I have ever worn in my life. The waist is fine. The thighs and calf area is beyond ridiculous. I don't even know what type of guys these pants would be made for. If you happen to lift (i.e. squats or have any leg mass) I would not get these pants. Wayyyyyy to tight around the thighs and calves (they barely fit over my calves). horrible. Seller was good and fast though.
2,Not that great,"I have 3 pairs of Dockers brand slacks in size 48 that fit fine. I ordered this pair in size 50 so that there would be plenty of space for my inside the pants gun holster, but even without the holster they barely fit. The waist and the thighs are smaller than my other Dockers. Also these pants are not actually Dockers, they are Levi pants, which is probably the reason for the size differences. Im done buying pants online, im just going to the store from now on."
5,Excellent transaction,"This pair of pants is great, and shipping of the product was worry-free. All in all, an excellent transaction."
3,"Cute, funny lesbian movie","I gave this movie three stars. It's a funny, light romantic comedy. It's not a great film, but it's cute and lighthearted. The premise is a little different than most lesbian movies. In this one, a straight woman who moved to New York from a small southern town doesn't want to tell her family that her boyfriend is black. Through a series of highly improbable events, everyone in her family thinks she's gay, and her boyfriend is really a woman. So rather than admit the truth when her sister comes for a visit, she ""hires"" a lesbian, played by Cathy DeBuono, to be her fake girlfriend. That's the set up. The humor flows from that. Naturally, she has a gay best friend, with all the obligatory gay jokes. The twist (which I won't spoil for you) is what makes this movie work, and it has to do with stereotypes."
5,This is the best gay comedy I've seen since the Bird Cage. Everyone I have shown it too loves it too.,This is the best gay comedy I've seen since the Bird Cage. Everyone I have shown it too loves it too. Now they all bought a copy.
4,Clever storyline,"Overall, I liked this movie. It had weak moments, but the acting was good, the dialogue right on the money, and there was a lot of comedy to keep it fun.A comedy of errors, this story is silly and light, but it also had its touching moments, and a happy ending. And I have to say the gay best friend was really adorable."
5,"Funny, funny, funny",How many times can a simple misunderstanding screw up your life. Well maybe its not so simple....... I really enjoy watching this movie.
1,disappointment...,"Bought this golf clubs set for my 10 years old son. On the second day, the driver head broke off the shaft. My son was completly disappointed....and so was I. very fragile stuff."
2,Cheaply made!!!!,"Same day received these clubs, my son was teeing off at the fourth hole and the driver head broke off the shaft. Seller replaced driver, but I went out and bought a better driver."
1,Pass the Mouthwash!,"I was trying to find an alternate for the Colgate tooth powder that was once available and since it wasn't listed on Amazon, tried this. The stuff appears to be a mixture of salt and sodium bicarbonate with the label showing tree bark and peppermint leaves added. This product has absolutely no peppermint flavor and tastes only of salt and baking soda. The label indicates it is made in the Seychelles Islands while I was sorta hoping for something from an industrialized nation with reliable regulations on the manufacture of health care products.It's an odd product that will soon be headed for a local landfill."
1,Salted tree taste!,Just got this. It is disgusting! It tasted like a pile of salt with tree flavoring. It may work wonders but I'd get sick trying to use it. We threw it OUT.
5,I have been using Ipsab for years,"I love the natural toothpastes. I do not have sensitive teeth but notices that my gums were doing so well. I switched to this and all of my problems have gotten better. There is some getting used to a power tooth cleaner, but its not that difficult. I highly recommend you try this."
2,Tastes Horrible!,"I usually use tooth clay, but ran out, so thought I would try this. I can't handle the taste. I thought someone put soap on my toothbrush. So I tried a dot on my finger and realized it was the tooth powder. The little I used seemed to clean the tooth pretty well. Will not use again. Hey I can use on my kids though.... threaten to brush their teeth with Ipsab tooth powder :)Another reviewer stated it isn't sea salt used. They don't say on their site. If it isn't... then another reason not to use it. You are missing a lot of the beneficials qualities if it is table salt."
4,Great right angle viewer,This is really useful for lowering the camera and getting great angles for your shots. Only con is that it needs a focus lock.
4,angle finder seagull,the products works well even if i have a little wiggle in the connector to the camera .... it does not seem do move out so far
5,"Seagull 1x-2x Right Angle Finder for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Minolta, Fuji, Olympus and Leica SLR cameras","Seagull 1x-2x Right Angle Finder for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Minolta, Fuji, Olympus and Leica SLR cameras is very high quality and it obtains very good image quality.I recommend this product for DSLRs."
4,Does what it is supposed to!,Better quality both mechanical and optically than expected. Adapter appears to be little fragile but so far so good. With the 2x magnification it is easy to manually focus camera for macro or low angle shots. Great value.
5,right angle finder,"i've had the seagull right angle finder for about a month and have found it to be more than satisfactory. it works well - comes with numerous adaptors to fit a variety of cameras - and it cost about a third of what the brand name angle finder cost. i thought it was well worth the money. however, don't count on the instructions to help you at all. they are completely useless, but using the angle finder is pretty much cut and dried - it's easy to figure out what you need to do to use it. i do encourage you to take the time to read the instrcutions as they're pretty funny."
3,Handy viewer,"Works pretty well, comes with several adapters so it fits my Nikon D7000 as well as my old Olympus OM-1. I like the 2X magnifier and the versatility it affords."
4,Seagull Right Angle finder,"Hey, this is great for the money....I use it for astronomy, focusing in the dark on tiny star images...so it pays to set it up in daylite, and tape the focus in place...its as good as the brand name one on my Nikon D-80, and much cheaper. got here quick too...good company."
5,Everything you can expect from a Right Angle Viewfinder,Nice product - cheap and does the trick. The image in viewfinder appears to be some distorted (pincushion like) but it does not affect the photo and it does help focusing especially with 2x magnification.
5,Improvement after first use,"I first used it before going to bed last night. This morning it was several hours after I woke up that I realized my eyes continued to feel good even though I had not done my morning ritual of hot washcloth on closed eyelids (as sufferers of blepharitis are supposed to do). My blepharitis is mild. Please note the product says it is for mild and moderate eye problems.When scrubbing, I keep my eyes shut lightly not tightly. This spreads out the eyelid margins and allows more follicles to be exposed.I do my eyebrows too! I like knowing they are cleansed and it softens the eyebrow skin too."
2,Buy the pads,I originally had some of the Ocusoft Lid Pads from my eye doctor. Those work really well. This isn't nearly as good. Spend the extra money for the pads. In the end I got more of them from my eye doctor. He told me that everyone likes the pads better.
4,OCUSOFT LID SCRUB FOAM is so gentle I use it on my entire face leaving it soft and clean.,"Having used the product for less than a month, I'm still getting familiar with using FOAM cleanser for my eyes. IGENE Daily Eyelid Cleanser, which I have used for a number of years, is a viscous fluid which I sincerely feel did a better job of cleaning off mascara. However, since I can no longer find it, I shall learn to be happy with OCUSOFT LID SCRUB FOAM. It works just fine, but it takes a second scrubbing to really do the job."
5,So helpful,"Very gentle, effective eyelid cleanser. It is easier to use than the individual pads because you can apply it in the shower and then thoroughly rinse. It completely alleviates the itchy and teary eyes i get from allergies."
1,Poor Shipping & Customer Service,"Long story short I got my item a month after my order because they shipped me someone else's order. After emailing with the company rep, he didn't keep me in the loop as to when I would get the item I ordered. Very frustrating experience. You'd expect more from a medical supply company. The item I ordered was for my health and the company rep had no urgency for the mix up. I'll never order from here again. My order should have been free."
2,Ed,"I have used this product for about 1 month (for Blephoritis) and am not sure if it is helping. I was following my Ophthalmologists instructions of baby shampoo for about 8 months but it left my eyes dry and itchy. Then I tried a bottle of SteriLid foaming cleanser until it ran out (1 month). The SteriLid seemed to make my eyes feel better but it was very expensive so I decided to try Ocusoft. Ocusoft is a similar foaming cleanser but comes in a larger bottle that would last 6-8 months or more. However, at this time, I don't think it may be effective for Blephoritis. Today, I used Ocusoft Plus lid scrub pads and my eyes seem to feel better. Unfortunately, the Ocusoft Plus pads are very expensive."
3,Lid Scrub,"I really don't like or dislike this product. I have Blephenitis in my eyelids, which is why I bought Ocusoft. However, like so many products on the market, it hasn't eleminated the problem. Hopefully someone some day will find a solution to the problem. In the meantime, I'll keep on searching."
5,I use this at the recommendation of my eye doctor. Helps,"My doctor recommended this for plugged tear ducts causing me great pain. I got a small container from the doctor but when I wanted to replace, I went to Amazon and got twice the quantity for the same price.Good deal."
5,Excellent Product and Value,"This product is a great value...the 7.25 oz (215 ml) size is a GIANT bottle in comparison to the (1.68 oz) 50 ml size...over 4 times the amount at just a few dollars more. I was paying $14 at the drugstore for the 50 ml size and even here on Amazon that size runs $10-11 dollars. Even with shipping I was able to get two of these big bottles (430 ml) for 34.85. The equivalent amount at the drugstore in the 50 ml size (the only size any drugstore in my area carries) would have taken 9 bottles and $126!The product itself is wonderful..soothing, non-irritating and perfect for those that need to keep their lids clean due to blepharitis, ocular rosacea or any other issues. Much easier to use than the scrub pads, and much less irritating as well.If you use this product and want to save, buy this larger size!"
1,Don't purchase from INTERSPECTIVE LLC,A previous order was linked to this page so assumed it was the 7.25oz (415ml) size since no size was stated. Received the 50ml tiny bottle instead for almost the same price as the 8x bottle.
3,"A typical ""lounge-y"" late 60's Tom Jones album.",Tom repeats his late 60's pattern with this album known mostly for it's title song (a Tom Jones classic) and some filler. Essential for Tom Jones' completists. Non-essential for others.
5,Great product!,"These were great! The paint does not dry out, they are incredibly easy for my daughter to use, and it makes painting so much easier. I just wish they came in more colors!"
5,paint,lovely family member gift and she loves to paint draw and color great stuff for any child she loves it
5,Very ingenious,I bought these for my 2 year old to use - they make painting so much less messy. I've even used them without the lids for fingerpainting and it's a big improvement!
4,great paint cups,I really like these cups. They work just like they claim. The paint doesn't dry up at all. The only downside is that they are so big. I would love it if they came in a smaller size.
3,sprill proof paint cups,I wasn't aware that the cups was empty. Now have to order paint for our granddaughter. She has one of these at home and loves loves it.
5,A Reminder of the Profound Interconnection of Life,"Ms. Guerrero has a magical way with animals and with words. I found her book to be an easy and enjoyable read - reminding me of the profound interconnection of life and the incredible wisdom to be learned from our fellow creatures. I loved the personal, heartwarming stories she shares to illustrate the lessons."
5,Simple Revolutionary Acts,"This is a great book. The ideas that Dr. Conklin express in his book are simple, but grand in scope. If you hate your job then read this book and ""get over it."" This books gives you permission to enjoy your job."
