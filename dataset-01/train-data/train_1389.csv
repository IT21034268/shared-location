5,I'd give it 6 stars if I could,"This is by far the best jig saw on the market for the money. It jigs, it saws. Smooth, easy to operate, a pleasure to use. Only thing to note is this is a barrel grip saw - you're holding the motor when you use it. It does get quite warm after a bit, but it's nothing to complain about. In fact, if you're outdoors and it's cold this may just come in handy as a hand-warmer."
1,A little too harsh for me,"I might be the only one, but I get a stinging/burning sensation when I use this product."
4,"decent product, sooths face, but no SPF","I picked this up at the store a couple of months ago, and it works well. I does have a nice light scent initially, and it sooths the face. It does not have any SPF though, so in summer I used a different balm. But it has been good this winter. Check it out."
5,Assessing Students,"The book is full of important information. As I read through each chapters, I learned a lot with the information that I was reading and some of the information I read are an eye opener. I would personally recommend this book to everyone to buy."
5,Superb Fim...Fantastic Soundtrack! Dont Miss!!,"Another golden nugget from perhaps one of the best years in film, 1970. Fragement of fear is right dead center in a time when films looked wonderfull, natural lighting abounds in this film along with a soundtrack that is as important as the rest of the parts. Hollywood take note...you lost your way, now you need to find the path back to the vocabulary, look and forward thinking of 60/70's. It's long past due. Hat's off to director Richard C. Sarafian!!"
3,Fragmented to the point of frustration,"""Fragment of Fear"" from 1970 stars David Hemmings the same year after he did ""The Walking Stick"" with Samantha Eggar and was directed by Richard C. Sarafian, the director who did ""Vanishing Point"" and then ""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing."" He is the same author who worked on Warren Beatty's ""Bugsy"" and ""Bulworth."" ""Fragment of Fear"" is beautiful to watch, but as the disclaimer says, ""Go ahead and tell the ending, if you can fit all the pieces together!"" it is fragmented to the point of frustration and does not seem to let up and with the film being available now through Columbia Classics, one can watch it over and over to get all the clues. The writing by Oscar winner Paul Dehn and cinematography by Oscar winner Oswald Morris are standouts. Hemmings was a new kind of hero. But it all depends on that missing cohesiveness that one wonders if it is really there."
5,The only book of it's kind. I loved it!,This book is the most unique experience I have had in a book. I think everyone will love it! It is so creative and entertaining. I am a professional magician and I was fooled. I highly reccomend it. Makes a fun gift.
2,Barely useful,"I am less than pleased with the performance of this computer. One gigabyte, even with Windows Home basic, is simply not enough. The system takes an eternity to boot, power down or go to sleep. Programs also take a while to load. As a result I try not to have more than 2 programs running at once. I tried tweaking with the settings on Vista to get the machine to run faster but it still seems to be very slow. I was also astonished to learn that it not only has only 2 memory slots, but that it is not rated for more than one gigabyte. Fortunately, others have indicated that they have had success in upgrading the memory and I am considering that route to see if I can get it to go faster.2/12/09Ok, I did some research. Replaced the two 512mb memory modules with two 1GB modules. It is now more responsive. It is still rather slow but now quite usable."
3,The surprises go on and on,"Even knowing what I know now, I would probably buy this computer because it is worth the money even with all the surprises. But the surprises seem to go on forever. I am not the greatest with computers and HP has sent me a lot of stuff I do not want and do not need. Moreover, Vista often tells me that some of the programs I have struggled to learn to use in the past are not compatible with Vista but they will tell me if they ever come accross a solution to the incompatibility problem. For example, Microsoft Picture It cannot be installed on my Vista driven model. It is not compatible. Both Vista and the programs that came from HP are loaded with all sorts of things that I have no use for and which only make my processor run slower. I am in my eightieth year and I need something to live for. If I keep at it every day for the next ten years, I will still have much left to fix."
3,Just beware of differences between it and your older systems...,"surprised it only has one serial port. had to purchase a converter cable to hook up my Palm Pilot. Also, the Windows Vista is not as friendly as it could be - referring to incompatability with older programs and hardware (speakers)."
1,compaq Presairo SR5030nx,"My desk top is not working properly, it hangs after each 4--5 minutes, while working screens gets cloudy and than hangs, I just bought it about 1 month ago, and want to return it, please let me know whats the process."
3,Not quite as said in your product description.,"(1) The photo in the product page showed a internal memory card in the front panel. But the product I received did not have it.(2) The Microsoft Office has a 60-day trial period, which was not said in the product description.(3) The item didn't come with the recovery disks and Window system disks, which was not mentioned in the product description."
2,fireside...,"there are some great tracks on this compilation, however for my taste it contains way too much rap to fit into the category it claims to do. not bad for the price i guess, but i'd prefer way more vocals (read = singing) and some instrumentals."
5,Great for travel,Purchased for airline travel. Already love the scent. Why do other perfumes not come in this great travel size I wonder?
1,Junk,I've tried Sandblasters in several different grits. They wear very quickly and they tear pretty easily. Find something else. You'll regret purchasing this item.
1,"cheap, cheap, cheap","Don't waste your money on these shutters. If you want, go to Home Depot and by the same thing for 1/3 of the price. The item is misleading, it is not a good quality. One of ours came split and cracked on the side. They are flimsey and fake looking.We did return ours and got a refund right away. The customer service was excellent."
5,Brazilian Flavoured Funk,"If you're into Latin deep house and lounge you will love this cd. My favorites are Coconut Lounge, Salsa D, and Latin Horns, but you will not be dissapointed by any track on this 2xcd compilation. A must have for your collection if you're into this type of music."
5,Absolutely Stunning...,"A quality sophisticated mix - F magazineGreat feel good album,quality throughout - Spiritual SouthA sunny and deep collection of Latin love - IDJAbsolutely Stunning, lovingly produced - Jazz UKA very good & different compilation - Blues & SoulA fine selection of songs from a very fine selection of international producers - DiscoidGreat collection of modern latin and brazilian influenced beats - BeatfanaticI challenge you not to get up and go carnival to this. It's almost impossible- RevolutionGreat stuff, some nice surprises, particlarly the unreleased tracks - SnowboyThere is one thing that unites this comp and that is that every tune has a hazy, hot feel about it. It is sexy music - Faze ActionA lovely comp with some great tracks - Raw DealA smooth, hip swinging, arm waving homage to the best on the latino dance floor - BeatzbaseA fantastic album. Ive played this prime time in every set since it arrived - Ben Mitchell (Sao Benitez/Mr Hermano)"
3,too much of the same beat over and over again..,"I got this after getting latin vibes 1. There are some good tracks on this, but otherwise it's same beat music that gets old quick.. latin vibes 1 does not have this problem and is much better from a creative/musical standpoint."
2,Bright ideas let down by poor follow-through.,"I have to teach 7 and 8 grade science using Heath's science textbook. I shall be recommending that our school group chooses a different text in future. Experiments are not properly commented in this work. As an example, children do an experiment involving the force of gravity, and the book fails to provide the formula for gravity's acceleration."
5,Computer Forensics,"""This is by far the most useful source of information on this subject -- clearly written, current, and technically insightful. I was impressed to see information not only about better-known programs, but also indispensable tools like Tom's Root & Boot."""
4,Good Introduction to Computer Forensics Investigations,"This book is a couple years old now, but the fundamentals remain essentially the same. Kruse and Heiser are seasoned experts in computer forensics and incident response and they have managed to boil down years of knowledge and experience into a format that is easy to read and understand. While security experts may not learn anything new from this book, those entering the field will find it invaluable. It is comprehensive and detailed while remaining easy to read. The foundation provided by reading and understanding this book can be used to move forward into more technical areas. Computer Forensics is not fluff by any means though and could easily be kept nearby as a handy reference for a computer forensic investigation.(...)"
4,Computer Forensics,"I liked the book a great deal.I often instruct others in this field and found it to be helpful, informative, and well written.Many of the items are of great value in doing proper investigations. I reccomend it as a book to have in your library if you are into PC forensics."
4,Computer Forensics,"This book is good for those not familiar computers. It keeps the material at a high level for the layman. Do not purchase if you are intending to receive in depth, technical analysis and techniques for training as a professional investigator. If you are just trying to gain an overview of the topic, this book should fulfill your requirements. It does a good job of directing the reader to appropriate external resources and tools to perform the forensic tasks the book discusses."
4,Très complet.,"Ce livre présente dans un langage très clair l'essentiel de la recherche de preuves numériques. La couverture est d'ailleurs très représentative du contenu, les sciences forensiques, et en particulier celles relatives aux ordinateurs prenant une importance de plus en plus grande .Les lecteurs trouveront dans le Guide du Cyberdétective paru aux Editions Chiron des applications pratiques de ces investigations dans la vie courante. Les deux ouvrages se complètent, bien que le dernier n'existe pour l'instant qu'en Franais."
1,Please don't watch this movie.,I am a generous critic. I like almost like something about a movie and review it generously. This movie is ridiculous. I enjoy the soundtrack. You should just keep listening it it. Acting is in one word: nonexistent. Its not funny. Its just dumb. Its not even silly. Its just a painful journey to watch this entire thing.
1,How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.,"I like Bollys. A LOT! I purchase and see many of them. Music and humor is light as air and an excellent palate cleasner, after the usual ""there been a murder"" ""let's blow something up"" type of films that currently pass for cinema.Kiiing is just plain out of the way I need to barf stuff.Horrible, terrible, rotten, no good and also a stinkeroo.Almost as bad as Marigold. Another alleged fun flic where I hated EVERYONE in it, regardless of their roles."
3,A 1950's view of international cooperation in spaceflight,"Warning: spoiler! This film was made after Russia's two dogs in space flights, which are referenced in the script by the one Russian crew member, but before any manned flights in 1961. It has the international idealism of the period, though some of the crew members have enough emotional baggage you wonder how they made the team to begin with. The moon inhabitants are never seen. After capturing two crew members for study, and demanding two lab animals to be left behind as well, they warn off the crew thinking that the daily bombardment of the moon by meteorites has been inflicted by the earth instead of being a natural phenomena. When the crew re-enters earth orbit, the moon puts the North American continent into a deep freeze. After two crew members make the ultimate sacrifice to return the climate to normal, the moon people decide that we can be friends in the future after all."
3,solid 3 stars for this science fiction gem,"Saw this one at the theatres in the 60's and these days, a good clearcopy of the movie has always been hard to find. So, yes thank youColombia for releasing this movie...and yes the picture is very clear.Its a black and white movie...but its ok...black and white make themoon shots more realistic.If you like movies like The Angry Red Planet, Snow Devils, Planet ofVampires...then im sure you will like this little gem."
3,Interesting Historical Curio with a Multilingual Cast,"Made during the height of the space race in the early 1960s, TWELVE TO THE MOON offers an advertisement for international cooperation, not only between the Americans and the Russians, but between members of all nations. An anti-Cold War statement, the film is now notable for the presence of some interesting actors in the cast, notably Tom Conway (George Sanders' brother) playing a Russian, and the Turkish actor Muzaffer Tema (in his only English language film) playing a Turkish astronaut. The plot is hackneyed, but the film is an interesting curiosity nonetheless."
4,12 to the moon,I saw this film when it was new in 1960. It has really not lost any of its magic for me. The DVD-R transfer was great and I was very pleased with the product.
2,Don't go this cheap,"I have not been too happy with this vacuum. It works, but the filter is a 3-piece set (sponge, cloth, ring) and the ring keeps falling off, blowing dust everywhere.The hose is easily clogged because it gets smaller at a fitting just before going into the tank.The power switch doesn't seem like it will last very long on my model. And my last complaint, it doesn't come with a crevice tool, which is what I usually use, so I had to buy one. Isn't that what most people use? (maybe it's just me..)UPDATE 10/07 - Yes, my power switch stopped functioning and this will be going into the weekly trash pickup. I will be shopping for a different brand at the big-box store.UPDATE 11/07 - I bought a Craftsman model for around the same price as this one (on sale) and OH the difference! It is so much more powerful and doesn't clog and it has an actual cartridge filter."
1,You get what you pay for...,Update: the vacuum stopped working after 3 years of very light use.I contacted Shop-Vac support and they responded with a quote of $50 for a new engine...I'm sure of one thing: my next garage vacuum won't be a Shop-Vac!This model wasn't a good choice for me.I didn't want a bigger capacity model but I can certainly use more power!The included accessories also are very limited.
1,Good Motor - But an unreliable product with the included filter,"You cannot expect the world for a lower priced wet/dry vac, but this product's performance ranks well below its price because the included filter is useless. You are better off with any other product unless you immediately throw the paper filter away and upgrade to a cylinder 903-- type filter. The paper filter that comes with the vacuum is secured by a plastic ring that you push (not screw or latch) on. It WILL will fall off during use with no warning - instantly blowing any dust you have collected into the room. By the time you see the dust it is too late. This happened three times in the first day of use (yes, we did push the ring on tightly, especially after the second time - didn't help). We would have been better of never turning it on. Again, purchase this product only if you upgrade the filter prior to first use."
2,Clean Freak,"This product is great for the compact size, but as for cleaning it leaves alot to be desired. I purchased this to make it easier to clean the car interior and workshop benches and equipment. The attachments that came with this product is not anything needed to get in those tight areas. It is my own fault for not reading the product details, but this is the first time I have ever bought a wet/dry vacuum that didn't come with an attachment for those tight places."
1,had to replace just out of warrenty,"My Shop Vac lasted just long enough, with occasional use only and not abused, to be out of warranty when it died. Went and replaced it with a RIGID, which has a lifetime warranty. The difference in operation and quality is obvious when you use both. Buyer beware."
2,shop-vac 6 gal 2 hp wet/dry vacuum,"I returned the vacuum because the nozzle and hose were too small to be useful for cleaning leaves, etc. in the garden."
4,Garrison rock,"This is pretty good kids. There's this little bridge that links Post-Hardcore and pop-punk that garrison enjoy strolling up and down. great hooks, lots of melody and loads of that ace jerky around kinda stuff... u know the poses"
1,Boring,There are two reasons I will not be playing this game. 1. It is boring 2. Having to put the disk in every time I want to play guarantees that I will not use it again. Are they really so terrified of copying that they make the use of the game a nuisance.Save your money -- buy something that is more fun and not aggravating.
1,NO stars!,"This is apparently a very old set up, as you have to leave the disc in to change games, etc. NO stars, I am sorry I bought it. My bad, I should have read the current comments about this disc, NOT the ones from 2003...Goodwill wins again! SERIOUS waste of my money."
2,Slots by Bally Gaming,"I guess I am spoiled by playing the various Reel Deal slots we also have loaded in our computer, I found these machines to be boring & slow by comparison. When we actually visit the Casino's in Vegas I have always enjoyed Bally slots so my expectations were pretty high. Maybe as newer versions evolve they will compare favorably with Reel Deal, but for now I am not impressed."
5,Jackpots are hard to get.,"This is an excellent product, but, winning the jackpots is so difficult. I've owned this item for almost a year. I use to play it often, but I got disgusted with not winning the jackpots. The games are just like the casino's versions and just as hard to win the jackpots. I've only won jackpots on two of the games and I have played them all for many hours and days, since buying it. I will try the newest Masque Publishing Edition of Slots, because they did an excellent job, on all the versions, in reproducing the casino games for personal computing play."
1,It's okay,"I bought this hoping it would keep me entertained. For whatever reason, this is a boring program. To be a whiner: I don't like that I have to insert the disk every time I want to play the game. None of my other games require you use the disk to run the program. I happen to like pressing the S key to spin the wheels and this only lets you use your mouse. Most of the graphics seem cheesy to me. It's just okay and nothing more. If I had a choice, I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Amazing Toddler Read!,This book is beautifully illustrated and captivates my three year old. The uniquely cut pages add an element of mystery and surprise when each page is turned. We can't enough of this book! I hope Lucy Cousins will write more about Jazzy and his adventures. Don't let your child miss the fun filled search for Jazzy.
5,Wonderful illustrations sure to captivate and entertain,Both my 4 and 2 year olds love this book! The illustrations are bright and colorful and the hide-and-seek story is very appealing to young children.
1,third hand quality,"This piece is very, very low quality. The handle on the product is deformed. It does not tighten unless I physically put the handles into the slots, and it is very, very hard to do. I will rarely if ever use this product. Would like to return it if it weren't so expensive. Otherwise it will sit in the back of the cupboard."
4,Not perfect workship but still is OK,"The only problem I have with this is that the workmanship isn't perfect where the lip meets the glass. It's also difficult to lock the glass into place. However, it worked out OK."
3,Descent book and insight of the bonds of the family through writings,This a good book even though very long if you want a good look at sibling relationships of the older children and of them with their parents. Hits some key time periods but leaves out some others which is a bit disappointing but understandle. Would recommend to someone who enjoys long books as well as anyone who liked/;ikes the Kennedy family.
3,Not a bad Helo sim,"This game can be fun...the people models are not very pretty but the helicopter looks good. The flight model in realistic mode is a real challenge... trying to land on the ship is a pain! Alot of missions to do and a career mode. You'll have to get the patch for it, and i would suggest a progamable joystick with trottle to set the controls... they are not very user friendly! I play at 1600x1200 and my machine is not that nice...then terrain is blah but it works for what it is. The only non-combat helo sim besides the microsoft titles (if your machine is new!!!) that is worth a damn. Try the demo first if ya like that you'll like the full game."
2,An improvement?,"Is this game an improvment over S&R 2? I don't think so! The manual is wrong and some of the features just aren't there. (Autopilot). I got this game and I'm not sure it is worth it. The price is too steep for something that has more errors than S&R 2. I really wanted to like this game, but no luck, it just isn't fun and it isn't a simulation. Maybe SR3 will be better."
3,Intersting but disorganized,Lots of information but needs better organization. Each page of the book has a center major topic colloum with a side bar of short subjects. You constantly get distracted while reading the major subjects. If you an information junky or like to read catalogues then this format may suit you.
4,"Finally, a book about Vera-Ellen!","I could never understand why someone who had been in as many major films as Vera-Ellen had virtually nothing available about her in print. After all, she danced with both Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in several films each and is in the holiday classic ""White Christmas"". This book seeks to provide what information is available and although many unresolved questions linger, it's a great start to finding out more about who I think was the best female dancer in films. I enjoyed the book very much and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone interested in film and/or modern dance. It's such a shame she retired from films relatively young, but as the book describes, Vera-Ellen's career seemed to be doomed at every turn by miffed studio heads, bad timing and just inexplicable oversights of her abilities by those doing the hiring in Hollywood. There are a number of photos of her in her retirement years as well as classic film stills. A great read."
5,Vera-Ellen: The Magic and the Mystery,"I found this an excellent book of an actress/dancer that so little had been heard of for so long and I was delighted to have come across it whilst looking for information on her, on the Internet. For anyone interested in the old musicals, this book is a must. Eileen, Cyprus."
3,"Some good information, pictures, but overall not well-written","I had enjoyed watching Vera-Ellen in ""White Christmas,"" but didn't know anything about her. I found some of the information interesting, but Soren's gushing about the star and bad editing of the text were distracting and cheapened the work. The photos are great and he obviously did a lot of research. I liked the quotes from Vera-Ellen herself taken from interviews, etc. But the book was not well-written. I hope that someone steps up with a more unbiased, accurate, professional biography about Vera-Ellen in the future that does this immensely talented dancer with such heart-breaking and life-threatening problems justice."
5,Vera-Ellen: The Magic and the Mystery,"Even if you have a slight curiosity about Vera-ellen's life this is a must read. Not only does it provide intimate insight into her thoughts about her life and career it also describes her experience with the star maker machinery of the movie business at that time. Also, it' a great guide for watching her movies. As shown on the screen, she was a wonderful human being; like Regan said ""the camera never lies""."
5,Vera Ellen - The Magic and the Mystery,"I have been a fan for many years, and always wondered why she was not more popular. It is sad to see such talent wasted and to know that the loss of her child changed her so drastically. (I lost a child but you have to live the way they would want you to.) It's too bad she lived such a short life. I loved the information and all the pictures about her.Judy Francis"
4,Introduction to Yoga,Great book by one of the pioneer's of yoga in the United States. You will see results and feel better right away!
3,Light and Travel-Friendly,"During my six-month stay in Ireland, I found this to be a sufficient guide. Plus, it is pretty light and easy to carry in a full backpack. However, I found that other guides were more descriptive and accurate, so it really was used as a companion guide. Go to a restaurant or pub it recommends and ask about lodging, entertainment, etc. The people there usually will help you quite a bit, plus you find out more info than can ever be put into a book."
4,Clear Explanations,"Speech Science was one of the first classes I took in pursuit of my pre-requisites needed to apply to grad school to become a SLP. My professor used the Introduction to Speech Science as one of our texts. I found the book to give clear and insightful explanations to the science of speech. The diagrams and descriptions were very helpful in doing our own self-evaluation of the differences between vowels/consonants etc. Overall, I feel that this text offers a great introduction on the topic."
2,Textbook buys are perilous!,"This was a frustrating purchase, because I needed the book on short notice for a college class, but it was not available at the bookstore. Two attempts to order online (not Amazon) were canceled after they had been confirmed. Just after I placed the Amazon order, the book became available at the bookstore; and since the class had already started, I bought the book there and attempted to cancel the Amazon order. I thought I had done so, but about ten days later the book showed up.To add insult to injury, the text is gutless, more suited to a freshman class than the senior-level one I am taking."
5,"Superb audio..derived from wonderful 78 RPM discs, thank God","Thank God the producers of this cd didn't decide to burry the recordings in reverb and echo, we get the TRUE 78 sound here, and it sounds clean, and chystal clear. Ignore the spiteful reviewer who thinks the sound is bad. Les Browns has never soudned so clear on cd before, you can actually hear every note, because they didn'r ""over-remaster."" ASV(Academy of Sound & Vision), is a respected label, and believe me they know what they are doing. All of Brown's ESSENTIAL sonsg are here, including Leap Frog. Brown had one of the freshest bands around in the mid-forties, and he had the greatest girl singer in Doris Day(the worlds most underrated jazz singer). This cd is a God-send to those who really want to hear the msuic unfiltered, yet clearly and beuatifully. Great job ASV, let's hope for a Volume II!"
2,Barely adequate audio...derived from 78 RPM discs,"The wonderfully musical Les Brown Band is done an injustice on this release, all derived from Columbia 78 RPM records. The audio can't compare with the Columbia tracks issued from their studio master tapes & or wax masters. Every track has been issued on CD before except for HIGH ON A WINDY TRUMPET. Vocalists except for Doris Day tracks are unidentified, Betty Bonney, Jack Haskel& Ralph Young, Butch Stone & featured trumpeter Jimmy Zito go un-named. I believe this is a <copyright run-out> CD as all selections are 50 + years of age!"
4,Very User Friendly,"This book is written for teens, therefore it is generally straight forward. I love that the author tells the kids, ""I have to work at writing."" It is good for them to understand that almost nobody just sits down and writes and gets it right the first time."
2,Cute idea; could have been executed better,"I just got my Hipshot and I have the following observations:--My Diana camera won't fit into it, full stop. If I ever get one of the ActionSamplers it'll go in here.--If their 120 format cameras don't fit in the bag, then WHY do the film-holsters ONLY take 120 film well (no ""lip"" on 35mm to hold it)--Almost none of Lomo's 35mm cameras take an external flash. So WHY did they design one pocket just for a Colorsplash or Diana F+ flash?It's not worth returning and it may be worth using if I can figure out how to cram my Diana into it, but otherwise this item is all hip and no functionality."
3,it's ok,"The Lomo Hipshot camera bag is just what it looks like, a simple small pack that you can stick ONE small point and shoot camera and a few rolls of film. The film holders are made of some strechy fabric that once it gets streched too much can't hold anything. If you absolutly have to have lomo then go ahead and get this otherwise I'd say pass on the Hipshot and search Amazon for a messenger bag that can hold a lot more for the same price!"
3,What Happened to Oregon Grape?,"The author is from Oregon, I'm from Oregon and I bought the book in part because the cover art includes the ""Oregon Grape.""Alas there is nothing for this berry anywhere in the book. This was dissapointing as was the coverage of thimbleberry, another Oregon berry. I was hoping for more information on identification of berries. The photos in the book are clear but sterile with few references to leaf shape or bush size etc. I have not tried any recipe but they look varied and yummy. Tips for the kitchen such as how to test jams and jellies is useful. As a recipe book it's solid but for identification and complete variety it's lacking. How can you have something on the cover but not include it in the index?"
4,Packed full of berry info!,This book is fantastic :-)The author has included information on every berry you can possibly think of... and then some! I had no idea some of the berries mentioned were edible.There is info on every aspect of the various berries - including how to grow them.Definitely has more detail than I expected!
2,lots of recipes!,"this has some good recipes, but wasn't a good choice for a kindle purchase! layout isn't great for kindle use. wish i could pick each recipe from table of contents and view on one page. i did use it for some recent frozen berry desserts i made for a potluck and was happy with the outcome."
3,apt title,"This cookbook reminds me of some of the cookbooks I got in the 1980's published by Rodale. It has a very researched, history of the subject, informational feel and is filled with recipes from traditional to creative along with encyclopedic information about berries. The only disappointment is that the gorgeous photo of berrries on the cover is the only image in the entire book."
2,"If you really want this CD,","you can buy it very cheaply as part of the box setPerfect Blues Collection. I wasn't very impressed by it, but at the price it was an interesting side trip."
5,always in touch,"A stunning piece of work probably never to be equaled. The mix of acoustic and eletric is outstanding, but this is not a record for all. The experimental vocals and some of the jazz inflections will surely scare off most early John Martyn fans, who wish that he would stay an early twenty something folkie for the rest of his life. Fortunately he evolves and keeps evolving. This lp did not receive the Montreaux Jazz fest gold record award for nothing. One could walk down in Chicago ""Old Town"" years ago and hear stuff like this coming out of some of the finer places late at night. The beauty and depth of the lyrics are immensely full and tantalizing while the guitar work gives shivers.With Stevie Winwood and most of the rest of Traffic here helping out along with Bobby Keys on sax and Danny Thompson on stand-up bass it can not help but be a superb record."
4,Good if you're familiar with TOC,"This is a good explaination of why the various allocation based account methods lead to poor management decisions and a good introduction to a better way of accounting. It does not include how to reconcile throughput accounting with required GAAP reporting. The only book I know that does is The Measurement Nightmare, which is a rather difficult read. It would be very helpful to have a book with example problems to work, an explaination of the GAAP reconciliation process, and more detail into what costs are totally variable and non-totally variable."
1,"Don't waste your money on this book, Throughput Accounting by Thomas Corbett","As an MBA student, this book was required reading for my Managerial Accounting class. I have to say, that it's probably the most poorly written document I have seen in all of the classes I have taken thus far. In fact, I cannot believe that any publisher or editor would have allowed it to be printed. It is riddled with grammatical errors, misuse of words, and sentences that are written as if by a sixth grader. On top of that, it is exceedingly frustrating in it's repetition all throughout the book. The 156 pages of text could in all likelihood be whittled down to 50 pages of real material. In fact, even if it were 50 pages, I wouldn't recommend this book. Save your money, it's really just the author's way of getting your money on his re-write of Goldratt's books on Theory of Constraints."
5,terrific book from a provocative and clever author,"I read the other reader reviews with amusement, wondering exactly who plants these things? The book is a joy, a ground-level look at the reality on the ground in terrorized Iraq after a decade of death and destruction, beyond the fatuous pronouncements of bought and sold commentators. We live in dangerous times, in need of smart, honest voices. This is a great read and an important highly personal story. Read this book."
1,Ditmars a disaster again,"This quasi-journalist writes yet another story about the most important person in her life - herself. In mangled verse, she attempts to write about many relevant issues in Iraq, yet manages to spend most of the book writing about herself. If you love Hadani Ditmars as much as she loves herself, this is the book for you."
1,Horrid,"The ""author"" of this ""book"" ought to be ashamed of herself. She isn't, of course, and that's saying a lot.A prior reviewer, after incomprehensibly gushing with praise, referenced the suffering children in Iraq, ending his observations with ""...[d]oes it really matter who is most responsible for their suffering?""The answer is yes. Yes, it does matter. After the fact of the suffering, it is the ONLY thing that matters, because it is the only the recognition of who is responsible that will allow the prevention of future suffering. It is precisely this sort of mushy relativism that operates as a salve to the bleeding, leftist heart. Further, throughout history such relativism has always operated as an apology for those visiting the greatest horrors upon mankind. In the end, people such as Hadani Ditmars, and the aforementioned reviewer, are morally repugnant."
1,Original is right,"A prior reviewer mentioned that a virtue of this book is its originality. Well, this is half right. It is totally original. But this is hardly a virtue. Someone else has pointed out, and rightly so, that there is nary a fact to be found within. And so we come to what must be acknowledged as quite a feat of ""spin"" - taking a work that someone made up from whole cloth - a pack of lies, as it were - and casting said effort as worthy of praise for its originality. Well done, apologists. I'm sure there are equally questionable mechanisms to be employed in re-characterizing all manner of horrors, and one presumes that such people as the author will waste no time in getting to the employing. One is tempted to observe that such efforts are an affront to reason and humanity, but one quickly reflects on how such an observation will certainly fall upon deaf ears."
1,This GPX S7694 5-Disc Mini System does not deserve any stars.,"Do not buy this GPX S7694 5 Disc Mini System!!! I bought one for my grandson for Christmas, guess what...the CD portion did not work. I ordered this because it could play records as well as CD's (but it never played a CD). I ordered it on Amazon.com but it went through Target.com, after opening it and setting it up the CD player would not work, didn't even go on. Two days after Christmas I returned it to the store only to be told I would not receive a refund on the shipping. I ordered a second one, this time it went through Amazon.com, it arrived very quickly. My grandson was excited to finally get his mini system, he opened it up and tried it out, guess what???? the CD player did not work again. This time I returned it through Amazon and did receive my shipping back. After returning this item I read other reviews only to find out most reviewers said there was a problem with the CD player!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!"
3,soo sad,"I loved this system. I asked for it and actually got it for my big Xmas present. I plugged it all in and got everything set up-including the set radio stations. I listened to the turntable...perfect. Radio stations...nice and clear. Cds...never worked. I read the manual over and over, but something was wrong with it! Nothing ever showed up on the screen when I put a CD in. So, we went to exchange it, but they've stopped making it. It broke my heart! If it had worked, I would have been so happy!"
4,Disco diva,"Bought this for myself Xmas 2003.Everything works well,I already had small wall speakers mounted,so wired the system to them.Now if only I could also use the original speakers!.Sound from the CD is the best of the four components,but sound from the rest isn't bad,all in all,pretty good for the price..."
5,I love it!,"Got this as a gift, think it's great. Plays my Flogging Molly records perfectly! Compact (relatively)! Great for one room living!"
4,I've read this twice,"I liked how this was about a woman, that had to be ""the bodyguard"", some parts made me laugh..... they were always disagreeing about something... oh yea, don't be fooled by the cover, this is NOT an interracial romance."
4,Louis L'Amour Collection on CD,"Driving alot, I enjoy listening to the L'Amour stories of the old west while I drive. Much better than the talk shows and trying to get music I like. L'Amour is a great writer, and the stories, especially the short stories, are very well written and easy to get into while driving. Many of the tecno-thrillers are too complicated to listen to, but there are very few of his westerns that I have not enjoyed while driving. This is a nice collection of Louis L'Amour stories read by Jonny Cash and other great personalities."
5,Country Western Fans Will Love This!,"I listen to quite a few audio books while traveling, but needed something to share with my Dad on a recent road trip. Since he is an avid viewer of cowboy movies, I hoped we could both enjoy this collection.I'll have to say that we did enjoy it. For me, having a number of performers and sound effects was a bit disconcerting at first. I'm used to listening to a book with a single performer. But once I got used to the format, I'll have to say that it added to the experience. And of course, how can you not like listening to the timbre of voices like Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash!So if you're a cowboy fan, and you must be if you're looking at Louis L'Amour books, I think you'll enjoy this collection."
5,CD's,We gave this as a gift to our son so I have no idea yet if he is satisfied with them. He hasn't yet had a chance to listen to them.
3,ok,I was disappointed that the last track of one of the stories wasn't playable. The other discs were all good. Shipping was quick.
1,Has this item changed?,"We ordered one of these bowls to complement our Winterberry set. When we received it, we immediately washed it very carefully by hand. Both the green leaves and the red coloring around the base began to come off. We returned it and asked for another to be sent. The second one had the leaves already coming off when we took it out of the box. We are returning it for a refund.The red base of these bowls appeared to be a red plastic film applied over the glass. Our other Winterberry glassware actually has red colored glass for the bases."
2,Chipped after just a couple uses,"This is a beautiful bowl, but the rim is not rounded--it is straight cut glass. It was great for serving chocolate popcorn in, but after I served mashed potatoes in it for Christmas dinner, there were two big chips in the rim. I assume this happened by the spoon hitting the rim, which I didn't see happen-- and no one did anything during dinner that would have made me suspect damage would occur. It was also hand washed carefully, and I still don't know how or when the damage occurred, because it looked great when I put it on the table. I never saw any instructions for not using hot foods in it, but its pretty obvious not to put it in the dishwasher. I am not buying another one, the rim just seems too easily damaged by normal use."
1,Not as it appeared ...,"First of all, it is not dishwasher safe as it was described. I also was not impressed with the quality of the bowl. Perhaps I should have known better considering the price, but the glass almost feels like plastic (it is glass, just not great) -- it thunks when you hit it with a fingernail. Overall very disappointing. I'll probably use it as a vase, not a serving bowl."
2,Very Fragile,"This bowl cracked with just a slight tap of the kitchen faucet while washing it out. Never even got to use it for Christmas Dinner. I would not use this item with any utensils. Candy bowl, bread bowl, etc. but not as a serving bowl. It is mislabeled as such.It is beautiful and we bought two so at least I have one to enjoy, but not as a serving bowl.OK...we now used the second bowl for bread on Christmas Day and it must have touched another bowl next to it and it now has a chip on the rim. So disappointing.Don't buy this bowl if you plan to use it much. Maybe a center piece candle holder.I contacted both the Lifetime Brands, Inc. headquarters in New York and the Pfaltzgraff website to tell them about this problem."
3,Winterberry bow,"I am sure the quality is great & that the bowl is beautiful; however, I have not yet received it. It was to be a gift for my daughter-in-law. When I try to track it, it says ""no tracking info available""."
5,Slightly smaller multitool,"When I was looking for a multitool, after I determined which features I wanted, my choices were narrowed down to the Juice XE6 and the Wave. They are very similar in features. A couple of things the Juice doesn't have that the Wave does, locking blades and interchangeable bit drivers. I decided to go with the Juice for a couple of reasons. First, it is smaller. Second, I usually wear shorts without a belt when its hot and I wanted to be able to put the tool in a sheath and hook it onto my waistband. The sheath for the wave has a belt loop, more reliable but of little use without a belt. So far, I've had it a couple of months, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this tool to anyone looking for a multitool but who would like one a little smaller than the full size Leatherman tools."
3,Not what i expected from Leatherman,"Had this for about a year now - got it to replace an aging Victorinox. The blades are fine, scissors are good, pliers and screwdrivers fine. Where it falls down is the corkscrew and can opener functions are nearly unusable. The corkscrew has a lever arm that folds out with it to aid in pulling the cork but it is so flimsy as to be nearly useless. The can opener is just poorly designed - can't get a clean cut even after sharpening it. the Victorinox can opener worked like a dream compared to this."
4,Almost Perfect Multi Tool,"I am not a huge fan of the ""multitool"" they tend to be rather large and are typically carried on the belt which I hate. This little guy is excellent. Small enough to carry in your pocket with out much attention yet heavy duty enough for serious projects. Leatherman did almost everything right on this one. If they could lighten it up a little and add a spring action for the pliers it would be 100% perfect. I'm amazed at the number of tools they were able to fit on it. 2 thumbs up! The only problem I had was when I tried to clip a zip tie with the cutters on the pliers it got stuck and took a bit of effert to get them apart.Update: Found another problem the flat head screw driver bits are very hard to deploy. I busted a piece of my nail off and got a nice slice down the middle of my knuckle on my thumb trying to get them out. I don't think I should need a tool to deploy my tools on my multitool. I still really like it though."
3,Mixed,"Just opened 'er up. First impression was a solid tool- little heavier than expected, but enjoyed the concept of metal strength. GREATLY disappointed to open the can opener to find small wood-chip like debris (see photo)- so my rare concern is quality control at Leatherman. Pliers were thinner than I expected, so the other user's picture of a broken pliers tip comes to mind. Best to think of this as a need-nose pliers tool, not a fix-the-car resource. All things considered, I'm keeping the one in my hands, but would classify this as more of a swiss army knife than a survival tool. IMHO"
1,Only a Joke,I imported the tool to Germany. Sorry. Thats not quality. Thats scrap iron. If the quality level from Leatherman dont rise they never become loyal fans in europe. The whole tool is crooked and the siccors have an extrem play. Nearly evrery tool have an defect. The engeneers should look to the swisstool ... that is quality
4,good product for the moderate user,"today a recieved my leatherman juice. on the whole i feel that the leatherman product is a quality product. i was considering a swiss army knife as an every day pocket knife. when i discoverd that leatherman had a similar product that included pliers. i looked a little harder at the juice. i also own the leatherman super tool and love the quality and utility of the product. if you are looking for a moderate use ( gentlemans) knife that has alot of bang for your buck, you cant go wrong with the juice. i will still carry the super tool on outings that may require a little more work. but as a general purpose pocket knife. its a go. im in law enforcement my girlfriend is a medic. got her one too im sure these tools will see alot of use from searching cars to cutting bandages."
5,Leatherman Juice,First off this multi tool is not my first leatherman. I checked out other models and this specific one stood out. I'm very satisified with my purchase. Just make sure to buy some oil to lube up the flatheads they're alittle tight.
2,This is a Thoroughly Dangerous Tool,I bought this tool as a lighter weight replacement for my Wave. I wear my Leatherman everyday at work but the weight of the Wave was becoming an issue. The size and weight of this Juice XE6 are just fine. The dangerous part of this tool is the non-locking blades and tools and the very sharp edges of the internal tools. I've cut myself 5 times with the non locking blades. I've drawn blood many times when the interior tools pinch my fingers as I open them. I've had it.I'm sending the thing back to Leatherman; this is cruel and unusual punishment.
5,Excellent!,I gave this as a gift to my best friend. He gave me a matching one last year in purple for valentine's day;-) He is always Mr. Fix It. Now if we go anywhere we have to make sure this is packed in our bags.
4,Fat.....................,It's a great little tool. Typical Leatherman quality. But it's fat ! It's the price you pay for getting all the functions. If i had it to do over I'd get the tool with fewer functions...................
2,Save your ca$h money...,I bought this cd thinking I was going to get early Bury Your Dead material that I had never heard before. I was quite wrong.Almost everything on this disc is early versions of what shows up on Cover Your Tracks.The quality is not as good and the musicianship is a bit lacking as well.This would make a great demo but it's not worth more than $10.00.I should have bought the live CD instead!!!
5,Damn heavy and mosh pit worthy,"This music is super aggressive, heavy and groovy. This is like the pride and joy of the tough guy hardcore scene, and believe me if you are a hardcore tough guy you will be windmill punching and kung fu kicking through out this whole CD. These guys make amazing high quality music, the best songs are ""Sunday's best"", ""Ten Minute Romance"" and ""Mosh n Roll"". Ten Minute Romance is a track about how stupid emo music and how emo kids need to get hurt. Mosh n Roll is the best groovy mosh pit song ever I love it I love this band."
1,Bait and Switch?,"the martini glasses i received do not look like the picture, each glass comes in 3 pieces a base a stem and the top. you must screw it all together and it looks unprofessional. the screw in portion is not straight so the glasses tilt slightly. i wonder if the company sent me a cheaper product. there are also weld burn marks on the interior of the glass."
1,Endurance? Poor Name!,"It's the epitomy of irony that these are called ""Endurance""! I hand wash and dry, always treating my barware with great respect. It felt like I was on Candid Camera when I simply put it down and the top just fell off completely. How can one justify the price for such a shoddy product?"
1,Airlines 2,I am very disappointed. The game will not start. I sent a support request to Selectsoft and got no response.
1,Doesn't work for windows 7,"I would like to return it, but i think I have no chance. I tried tons of options in compatibility, etc. Still doesn't work. Don't buy it!"
2,I was disappointed,"Airlines 2 is a bit simplistic and mechanical. Routes are all to/from with a single ""home"" and destination, so you can't spend time weaving flights and aircraft together. I don't get any sensation of fun here. All in all, I'd pass."
3,Could have been better,"Airlines 2 is great because it deals with building an airline empire. However, it falls short of being really entertaining. The fun factor is just to small. It cannot compare to any of the simulation games such as Railroad Tycoon or Ports of Call. Also, the developers changed the brand names of airplanes."
3,Stacked against the player,"I initially enjoyed this game; but as I have played it more I have come to realize that the game seems to be stacked against the player. While you, the player, deals with maintaining routes; managing the budget; growing the airline; and dealing with crashes. It appears that the computer opponent does not have any of those challanges as the computer opponent can grow and add routes at a very quick pace. Then you end up playing catch up to the computer opponent but never being able to catch up."
5,Best voice eer,"For all the people who do not realize what an absolutely incredible voice Jim has, this is one of those albums that will prove my point about that. ""Golden"" is truly the word to describe the voice of this marvelous singer. I highly recommend this CD>"
3,JUST ANOTHER ONE,"Even giving credit to the fact that this book was written by a pilot who was there ( Townsend served in 43 Squadron ), one cannot escape the conclusion that this is just another book about the Battle of Britain. And not the best, unfortunately..."
5,The Real Thing,"This is a truly excellent book. I have loved it since it appeared in 1970. I have some knowledge of the literature and technology of the RAF of this period; my father flew for them, and my cousins were killed as RAF pilots. They would have called this ""Pukka Gen"" -- RAF slang for totally correct information. Of great interest to me was the description of the development of the RAF and Luftwaffe before the duel began. The author writes with humanity and with graceful style. Highly recommended."
1,Description and Condition were very poor,"This unit arrived in a shrink wrapped plain white box with the model number GR-BC3 sticker on the box and the product. However, the one I got looks very much different than the one on the Amazon web site. Additionally, it came with two AAA Duracell batteries already installed, and LEAKING! Residue from the leak had stained through to the outside of the battery compartment. It is as if this was a return or factory refurb shipped out without any thought of quality control."
5,Patterns of Thought,"Pathological experience is not easy to describe or to define. In the hands of a master like Shapiro, we have a remarkable view of the manifestations of various mental conditions and their behavioral correlates. What Shapiro calls 'styles' are the forms of character structure that generate the corresponding characteristic symptoms. We are provided with the distinction between obsessive compulsive disorders, for example, and their relationship to paranoid conditions. We learn about psychopathy and the characteristic 'moment to moment' shifts in emotional regulation or disorganization and the symptoms of addiction. You will learn about hysteria and its relation to psychopathy. Understanding and recognizing the attitudes inherent in a mental disorder are necessary for appropriate therapeutic intervention. If this subject interests you, you will appreciate the work Shapiro has done for our field. He is not a master in disguise. He is a real master."
5,Wonderful product,"I bought these for my hubby for his birthday which happens to be deer hunting season. He loves them. Great price,fast service and great product"
4,AMAZONS PRODUCT IS REFURBISHED.,"BE SURE TO REVIEW THE ""TECHNICAL DETAILS"" OF THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL SEE THAT EVEN WHEN YOU SELECT ""NEW"" THAT YOU GET A ""REFURBISHED"" PRODUCT. I DID NOT NOTICE THIS UNTIL I LOOKED AT MY INVOICE AND I QUICKLY CANCELLED MY ORDER. BE CAREFUL."
4,Good deal,"They certainly are not up to the standards of the high dollar binoculars out there, but I think they are head and shoulders above anything else I've tried in their price class. The image is very sharp and bright and the weight for 8 x 42's is great.I don't care for this type of eye cups and I'd love to see a pocket for the lens protectors built into the case. That said, they're still a bargain."
5,"Excellent Binoculars, Recomended for Wildlife and sporting.","This is exactly what I was looking for, a good, durable, and sharp pair of binoculars for mountain walking, wildlife spotting and sporting, amazing image quality, a lot of chromatic aberration but thats common on this products.100% recomended"
1,Save yourself the aggravation,I wanted to brush up on my fishing so I subscribed to this publication. After reading a few issues it I found myself not really enjoying reading it. The fishing tips slim are at best and and a good deal of the magazine was not really about improving fishing. After you read a few issues they start repeating them self.The final straw came when I received a DVD that I did not request from Bass Master that if not return would start a DVD subscription! The same day I canceled my subscription! Save yourself the aggravation don't subscribe!
2,Bass magazine,"Bass angler magazine and flw magazine along with in fisherman are much better. Bass uses it as a marketing tool to sell more fishing stuff and promote their products. One of their features is a small piece on ""4-5 lures I never leave to fish without"" and some pro names each lure and most often each lure is made by berkly or strike king,etc. Give me a break! Insulting."
1,Still Waiting...,"I ordered this in the middle of March. If it takes much longer, it will miss the whole Spring season... Sure would be nice to have what I paid for. What in the world takes so long to mail a magazine?"
5,Patti Page Christmas Brings Back Memories,After years of trying to get a Patti Page Christmas album this was well worth the wait!!! Fantastic album with great songs. I am almost 47 and grew up on Christmas music like this. Patti Page is right up there with Doris Day in my opinion. Anyone should love this Christmas album. Thanks to Amazon for carrying it!!!
2,Very hard to read photo copied pages,"The reprinting of this book didn't turn out very well. The pages are extremely dark, so your reading black letters off of a dark gray page. Some of the pages are better than others, but overall it's a mess. I have really wanted to read this so I will manage, but it will take a lot of getting use to. BTW I have nothing to compare this reprint to, it's extremely old so maybe they would all be this way."
1,Kindle Version of this Book is AWFUL,The text is sideways and very hard to read. I paid $7 for it. Wish I could get that back or another version from Amazon!
3,Early architecture,Early Architecture in Ulster County was only slightly interesting. The authors made references to a large collection of other buildings documented but only chose to show a bare few of the majority. I would have liked the larger collection to have been available in print. Whoever sold this book to me left a previous price marking of $3 inside while I paid more than $20. If that lesser price had been removed I would not feel as if I had been taken to the cleaners.
1,Not Impressed,I tried the Kaplan prep guide and was very unimpressed with the quality of the CD. The Net result: I got a refund. Try ETS.
3,"It's OK, but not as a Tutor","This book is pretty good at telling you how the GMAT CAT is scored, administered, and the tests on CD ROM are pretty good. However, do not use this book to help you remember your High School education. In my opinion, it is not for tutoring purposes. You have to already know the formulas and proper English! This will ot teach you!"
1,100 best solitaire games.,"i expected some interactive programing in the book, different formats of unusual solitaire games. I did not expect tohave to go out and buy a deck of cards and play the gamess on the kitchen table. It's in my reference section gathering electronic dust, not good kindle material."
5,A very good book about one person card games.,"I purchased this book for my wife who is an absolute card nut. I don't care for card games so she has to play by herself most of the time. She likes this book very much, and always has it in her hands trying to learn a new game. I honestly have never seen any one who can play so many different single player card games. But, what ever makes her happy is alright with me."
1,Sigh,"I have no idea how good this book is. No one in my family has ever opened the book. or ever will. ever.I only hate this product because my wife thought she was buying actual solitaire games to play on her tablet, not a book. Needless to say, it has never been used. I know - our bad, not the product. Still hate it."
1,Poor Quality,"All of the games that I ordered were too SMALL to work with, including this one.I would like credit for all games that I purchased"
1,100 Best Solitaire Games,"I actually thought it was card games to play, not instructions. I am 79 and new to kindle fire and didn't see then to look inside. I am very careful now."
5,Outsiders - 'Outsiders Relax / C.Q.' (Hunter),"An exclusive two-lp's on 1-CD reissue. Of the two 'actual' Outsiders (Dutch psychedelic five piece) albums - their self-titled ('67) and C.Q. ('68). Didn't know the first several songs on the self-titled effort was recorded live in early 1967 - good to hear the Pretty Things-ish ""Story 16"", the foot-stomping ""Ain't Gonna Miss You"" and the rocking ""I Wish I Could"" as well as ""Filthy Rich"" and the moving ""If You Don't Treat Me Right"". Also liked quite a bit the core tracks of 'C. Q.' - like ""Misfit"", their signature song ""Daddy Died On Saturday"", ""Man On The Dune"" and the inspiring ""Happyville"". Line-up: Wally Tax (R.I.P.)-vocals & harmonica, Tom Krabbendam & Ronnie Splinter-guitars, Appie Rammers-bass and Leenderd-drums. I know I should hunt down a copy of their 'Singles A's And B's' 2-CD box set. Highly recommended."
1,Infuriating,"This book might be of interest to Christian apologists---andto ultra-conservatives who want to see their prejudices given divine approval---but Wildeans will want to grind their teeth.Oscar Wilde searched for Christ in the eyes of every lover heever had, but there is no place in Zacharias's theology for thisparticular kind of spiritual yearning. Nor does he seem to recall that Jesus preferred the company of sinners and prostitutes to that of the people who ""knew"" they were right.I suppose I should be grateful that Zacharias doesn't just toss Wilde into hell at the end, but I still resent seeing this gallant gadfly and seeker after truth reduced to a straw man for the author to knock down. A loud Bronx cheer to this smug littlesermon!"
4,needed for school,Awesome to be able to buy books easily and cheaply on Amazon. Came on time. Was exactly as advertised. And no waiting in line!
4,Concepts that should be incorporated in our life....,"I guess this book is what you would call the predecessor of the current Self-Help Books.The greatness of Nicomachean Ethics resides in the fact that it talks about all the different areas of life, justice, happiness, love and many others.The style of the writing is not very appealing -keep in mind it was written around the 3rd century BC -, nonetheless is clear and goes straight to the point.It is a good book that anyone who enjoys growing up should read..."
5,Psychotherapy? Happy Pills? or Aristotle? -- Aristotle!!!,"A previous reviewer described Nicomachean Ethics as ""the art of living."" I would agree with this sentiment. Aristotle not only teaches the art of living - but he teaches us that it is hard work. Such a conviction stands in stark contrast to the facile solutions that are contrived for ""happiness"" today. Happiness is not easy. It may not even feel like what we assume it is in our contemporary society (i.e., a feeling of pleasure, self-esteem, material goods). It is much deeper. It is about living the good life. A must read for all those interested in psychotherapy, education, and ""the art of living."""
2,"Classic Work, Terrible Translation",The translation of this work is inferior. The way it is written makes it slow to read and difficult to understand. I read excerpts from Hackett Publishing's version and it's much better than this version.
2,Interesting reading,"I found this book very challenging (it wasn't my copy I have to admit) and to be honest a lot of it was really way over my head, but I think I understood some of the main points. I think this will be interesting for anyone who wants to know about the moral values of people two thousand years ago, when there whole life style was much more serious than todays."
3,Okay,Not a bad (very) light read. It was interesting to learn about the strange (and sometimes fairly disgusting) origins of common English words. Interesting book.
4,Fun for multiplayer,"Me and my brother got this game for christmas. We started playing and thought the game was really fun. The game is more fun if you play the multiplayer mode. The game starts out with the playable characters being Jack, Elizabeth, and Will, but as you collect gold coins and statues you can unlock playable characters such as the voodo doll, captain pirate, Norrington, Jack as tribal cheif, and many others. The best of these in my opinion is the captain pirate(He waddles like a penguin, but can beat a guy in 2 hits). The game takes less than 5 hours to beat ON NORMAL SETTING.The game follows the storyline of the movie pretty well but skips a few parts like how Will gets the key. I dont understand why they didnt make the Flying Dutchman a level . It would have made the game longer. You start out with a cutlass but as you collect coins you can buy weapons. The best weapon you can buy is the native blade."
4,"Hated the Movie, But the Game Isn't Bad!","It was fun to play. It is NOT the greatest game in the world, but I am not looking for breathtaking games. Just something to entertain me in my daily 10 minutes of free time.The graphics are good, and the plotline makes sense.In all, it is worth it for the price."
4,Great game!,"I got this game at the end of October for my birthday and on a normal day-to-day bacis of school, homework (Way too much of it!), and other video games I have, I finished at the end of November. The graphics were really good and I liked being able to buy new weapons and characters and that sort of thing. But the fact is the game is way too short! You might as well just use the characters they give you on the level because you'll never use the characters. At least I didn't. I only bought one weapon which is the Native Blade and well that's all I needed. The boss levels were extremly easy, though I was playing Normal Level. The Mini Games were good but the only one I'd play again and agian is ""Shoot the Money."" Out of many fighting games there's no guts, blood, cussing (from what I remember but I seriously doubt there is any!) or anything sexual which is a Plus! Overall I liked it and I think you should get."
1,"AWESOME MOVIE, HORRIBLE GAME!","I am sorry for all the Dead Mans Chest fans that wasted money on this game. It has gameboy color graphics and if you like violence games, this is not one to get.I am only ten and it is not violent enough! The minigames are boring! And thats not all! During the entire gameplay you only play as Jack, Elizabeth, and Will. There are parts of the game that were not even in the movie! Make sure you see the movie before playing the game because the game would be a horrible first impression. I beg of you, no matter what the media says, do not fall into the same trap as me!Sincerely,Parker 100."
2,"Works good, but too big","Drive works great. I bought it because of the ability to swap SD cards if needed. BUT... it doesn't fit in the front port on Dell machines. Plus, I have 2 ports on the back of my laptop. It won't fit if I have my mouse plugged in to the other port. On other machines, I have to remove the keyboard in order to plug it in. Not very useful. I've been using the small cord that was included, but it suddenly stopped working. I'll be buying a smaller one that won't give me these problems."
1,I think there is something wrong,This purchase was the second time around I have purchased a SD Card branded Sandisk. The first time I bought a 64M in a local store and I had to replace it after 2 months when I could not read and write properly to it anymore. I don't know what I was thinking but I purchased this through a friend in the US ( I live in Canada) and was happy with it until few weeks ago when I started loosing files. At first I thought it was me but then it just become worse and I have now reached a point where I cannot successfully write to it again! I admit that I use it extensively but this should not be happening! since it really can't be me I have to wonder about the quality of the product. I have searched this site but have to yet find a reference to warranty and how to claim it. Sad thing is that alternatives are hard to come buy especially at this price but be forewarned!
4,Very good product,"Although I have not begun using the item frequently, I am very happy with it's performance. It is exactly as described and seems very reliable. The only thing I have noticed (and this is only if I am doing something wrong) is that I have not been able to save directly to the Cruzer. I've only tried doing so through Photoshop 7. When I attempted to save my file and had navigated over to where the drive should reside, the Cruzer was not a visible option to save to. Of course, I could still copy and paste the file over without incident.Something to consider...I purchased this item instead of a portable burner for my notebook and so far have been very glad that I did so."
3,*Edited* New design out.,"Handy, tiny, reasonable price, fast interface are the plusses.Their old design did not fit into quite a few of my USB ports because of the body shape is a big minus. I had to get a USB extension cable to plug it into the front panel ports on my computer.Their new design is much more slim and trim -- and seems to have no trouble with fitting the front USB ports on all my machines.Overall, good price for a good product."
3,Problems in Windows 98SE,"Cruzer Mini 256 is great on a Windows XP machine, but on Windows 98SE success is yet to be had. Have downloaded the drivers off Sandisk website(and there are 2 zip files) and installed them according to each individual set of instructions and still no recognition of the Cruzor Mini. In the Cruzer_Family_98Se.zip file there are 2 zip files for CAB's that neither Windows XP nor 98SE recognize? Any suggestions would be helpful."
3,"SD Card great, problems with Cruzer drive","I use the SD card in my Palm (m505) with considerable success and am happy with it from a pure PDA expansion perspective. I have found that the Cruzer drive is unreliable, usually Windows sees it as ""write only"" which means the Cruzer is only useful to read what I can put on the card using the Palm. (I have checked the write protect slide on the card). This means I cannot use it to transport files, keep personal backups, etc. SanDisk tech support were very helpful and responsive, since I have been handed over to ""customer relations"", I have heard nothing in over a week."
4,Style Guide useful to date,"I have purchased the book 3 years ago for my image business. I have read it and was an inspiration point for me many times, although there is information that could have been more developed.What I liked most is the fact that the authors are describing and analizing also paintings in regards to the morphology of the body and style.I disagree that the book is outdated. It is not, for the one who knows how to use it. However, it could become a bigger compendium in absolute all chapters if would get re-edit it with more detailed information.Mrs. Carla Mathis (AICI CIM) is a Lady of Image Consulting and many of us have learned from her, either from her Image school or from the publishings."
3,Hard to sympathize,"I enjoy reading about women in history and their roles in society. Southern history is an especially interesting topic for me. Ms. Clinton paints a clear picture of the plantation mistresses of the south, but I find it hard to sympathize with these women. In comparison to the lives of black women who were slaves at this time, the plantation mistress had it pretty good. They weren't expected to perform hard labor and they didn't have to worry about their husbands selling their children and families away. The southern ladies were able to come and go as they pleased, and were placed on a very high pedestal in society. I think I would have enjoyed this book more if there wasn't such a ""poor pitiful white woman"" undertone throughout the chapters. Although this book contains many details of the life of a plantation mistress, it didn't really contain any information that was new to me."
1,"Dull, boring.",This book is so dry I couldn't even finish it. The subject is fascinating but the material is presented in a way that is just plain boring.
1,Political Commentary Not History,"It is true that the authoress quotes much from some primary sources, however the book is basically an expression of her political/social opinions and is not a history. Her liberal biases, ardent feminism, lack of respect for Christian values, and her very limited understand of Southern culture and history, are overwhelmingly expressed. If you are an historian who was taught to evaluate primary sources without your personal biases, and if you are interested in a true history that reflects these values, you'll be sadly disappointed with this book."
2,Revisionist History,"This is an amazing example of what I've only heard about heretofore: The feminist attribution of motives that probably didn't even enter the minds of the plantation ladies Ms. Clinton has written about. Her research sample is small and perhaps overused, but quite interesting when letters are included in the text, and therefore there is some worth to the work. Often foolish, this book says more about the author's politics than the lives of plantation mistresses."
2,Left Me With Even MORE Questions,"I must have picked up this book for the wrong reason.I was hoping to hear Mr. Ferreras' explanations regarding the Free Diving World Record Breaking Attempt which took place on October 12, 2002 (seeing as the book is called ""The Dive"" and it starts with the event of that day)... a dive which took Audrey Mestre's life. I was hoping to find his point of view regarding the unfortunate series of events (sorry Lemony Snicket) which lead to Audrey's death.Instead, he used that unfortunate day as the backdrop for his story... not answering any of the lingering questions surrounding Audrey's death, and instead indulging in how his life was, on how ""obsessed"" he became about making Audrey ""the undisputed queen of the depth""... all for his own glorification.Obsessed.. that's exactly what he was: obsessed with glory, and with using Audrey as his way to glory."
3,Left a bad impression,"The book is called a story of love and obsession but frankly the words should be reversed. Peppin Ferreras is obsessed with the sea and with free diving. The book makes that clear but I wasn't so sure about the genuine love. If his wife had chosen to just watch him dive instead of becoming his creation would he have been as happy with her?The love story aside, when the book talks about the sport of free diving it picks up steam and becomes somewhat interesting but not enough. This a library book or a wait until it comes out in paperback read."
2,Avoid it if you're just interested in SCUBA,"I bought it thinking that it was a 100% SCUBA story. It resulted to be another thing.Love, and someone trying to justify how a woman died, just one of the subjects...The story is not bad anyway, but I would not recommend it."
2,No answers,"A lot of the reviews say: ""I wanted to find out about Audrey"".For those who are seeking what happened to Audrey, read ""The Last Attempt"" by Carlos Serra: a sad, but excellent book."
1,No Way,"I regret having obtained this book. I was looking for answers on what happened to Audrey. Instead, I found Ferreras contradicting his own words when compared to his own previous statements through tv reports and articles presented here in Spain, and selling his own ""obsession"". And the only love story I see is a unilateral one.And when it comes to diving, he admits making the mistake that took his wife's life. Checking the air pressure by hand? In Spain that would have been a severe case of negligence and his picture taken with some numbers in the chest. In summary, we still don't know what really happened."
1,Inferior product - not worth the money,"This product worked for four or five hours before it stopped working. Customer service was slow to respond to emails but was reasonably helpful. They replaced the power cord, after which the fan worked for another hour or two before dying again. Rather than wasting any more of my time I'm going to buy a different product.It might work more consistently on battery power, if that's what you want it for. I wanted it primarily for plug-in operation, and I don't recommend it for that application."
5,Found Them at Amazon!,I have such a hard to find shoe size 10.5 SS and finally found one! I love Cole Haan but retail prices I can't afford. Love these shoes....true to size!!!! I've been looking for a leather sole shoe to use for Shag dancing at the beach. Highly recommend. Neat looking with pants.
2,Thin on the ground,"Ideas are a bit thin on the ground for this brief book.The focus of the book is how to quickly get up to speed as a newly-employed apartment manager. There are some good ideas such as the importance of smell, the pros and cons of working as an apartment manager and time management.The book is short, 129 pages in a large font, with lots of white space. For example, the book ends on page 118, then pages 119 and 120 are blank, pp. 121-128 are blank with the designation ""Notes"", p. 129 is an order form for further copies of the book (wishful thinking!), then there are three more completely blank unnumbered pages.The topic of the book is a good idea, surely someone could put together a more comprehensive work."
1,Weak,"Most chapters are one or two pages long. Some sample chapter titles: Dont Take Cash, Beware The Clipboard, etc. Oh yes, 10 numbered pages at the end of the book that are blank - you know for notes."
5,Terrific and comfortable,"These anklets are soft, sheer, yet strong and very comfortable on my feet. I am a diabetic with a bit of neuropathy and the cushion on the bottoms is enough to allow me to wear my cute flats. So far, these are durable as well. I've washed and worn the same pair for the past 2 weeks and no runs, wholes or snags.Delivery was fast and packaging was excellent!"
3,Mostly Nylon,"I purchased these thinking that these were all or mostly nylon (as I prefer natural fiber to synthetics). These are 71% nylon, 26% cotton and 3% spandex, so the ""sheer cotton sole ankle hi"" was a bit misleading. These are working out nicely thus far. No complaints. I do like the shorter length (vs knee highs)."
1,"Sheer Cotton Sole Ankle Hi, Neutral Beige","These socks are very tight rubber banddespite the fact that I have a thin foot in this place.Can not wear.!What kind of a strange request, write a certain number of words? Very Rood and do not making sense!!!"
5,best thing ever,"I love the hard plastic...if my child drops it, it's okay...no broken dishes! I wish that I could find these pieces sold seperatly because I would deffinetly buy more bowls and plates."
5,Very helpful and encouraging book,"This book was incredibly helpful to me, especially as a Christian. Ms. Keen addresses the seriousness of depression in a very grace filled and experienced way. She covers all the root causes of depression, both physiological and spiritual. I found this book to be very encouraging without a hint of condemnation or judgement. I highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling with depression and needs hope from someone who has been there."
1,Pop Psychology with Religious Twist,"If you or someone you know suffers with depression, PLEASE opt for real and honest help as opposed to this type of pop psychology. Just because one calls themself a ""Christian"" and refers to God and Jesus adnaseum, does not a specialist make! PLEASE be wary of those who claim they have experienced something and happen to have access to a publisher. Depression is VERY serious and it deserves to be treated with proper and effective respect to make a real difference.And yes, I am familiar with Ms. Keen's other work and found it all very narcissistic.... therefore diluting ANY advice to those in need of very real very professional counseling. Do yourself and your depression (or other condition) a favor and please seek the writings of the educated and knowledgeable."
5,"Something Different, but GREAT","If I have given 5 stars to this CD is beacause this 18 or 19 year old girl has stuff of her own in there plus she is one of the producers... that takes alot of talent. She has a different voice from the other female singers out there. The lyrics and music are great. I could see her as the relevation of Mexico for 2003 and for Latin America 2004; may be I am mistaken, I don't know, but I do know that the CD is a must have. At least in Latin America is not to easy to find this kind of music with lyrics in Spanish."
4,Renovó mi música leve,"Resulta que la escuché en un momento en que necesitaba música simple. Y resultó. Me gusta su voz, y sus armonías simples pero bien armadas... espero que el segundo disco no arruge.Lo recomiendo para momentos en que se necesita no cuestionarse nada. Es un disco para escuchar mientras viajas."
5,Wesley's vision,This is a delightful book to learn about the gentle side of the Wesley's. You will need to read others to get the bigger picture.
5,Great Buy +,"This dictionary has it all + simplified examples. Bottom line, if you think it you'll find it."
3,Triple pearl strand,"Product arrived quickly and nicely boxed. Quality of the pearls is quite good. Only issue is that the connection between one strand and the clasp came apart the first time my wife wore this item. I was able to fix it myself, but the entire clasp and connections seem to be lower quality than I expected. We will probably have a local jeweler install a better clasp."
5,Eclectic but brilliant sound,"I would have to put this in the general art rock genre. Many haunting, and beautiful songs that bend different genres. I love the atmosphere of the album, especially Chino's presence."
5,One of my favorite albums!,"I don't even know where to begin with this. I bought it at Wal-Mart, because it was on sale, and I figured I'd regret it, but after I listened to it, I was just like ""Wow"" I'm a big Teenager fan, so these songs really got my attention. And Mary Timony is one of my idols. This is awesome, you should buy it."
4,Solid album,"This album's decent, but fell a little short of expectations. The leaked tracks from a few years back were just about as solid. You would only expect an improvement with this kind of wait.Tomb of Ligeia is a standout track, but the vocals are a little flat. Blvd Nights and Ever (Foreign Flag) are other standouts. Much of the rest of album is a little weak."
4,Good but not Great,"I am, like others, a fan of the early leaked tracks. This album while very good, could have been a masterpiece of they had stayed a little truer the that original sound. When I first heard of Team Sleep I was expecting music more along the lines of Lucky You, Digital Bath, and Teenager. While that is not how it turned out I still liked the demos and in time I grew to really enjoy them. I don't know this cd might grow on me but with so many good bads releasing albums soon like Dredg and such I think this album might take a back seat for a few months. I also think King Diamond took a turn for the worse with the new version. But with 20,000 copies sold in it's first week we might not hear much more from them unless more people get into the music. However seeing how this isn't easily accessable music, I don't see that happening. But hopefully there will be more in the future."
4,Chino's outlet,"Being a Deftones fanatic all these years it was a given I would be in love with this album. I like the experimental/ambient type of stuff Moreno takes time to write, but it seems to have overlaped into his original band. ""Kool-Aid Party"" with Mike Patton should have been on here, the track has such a cool/creepy vibe to it that it lacks not being heard. One reviewer mentioned that the leaked tracks were better, and he is right but overall the album is worth a listen. Something nice to put on and relax to."
4,"Slow moving rock, very peaceful.",If you are the ultimate Deftones fan buy this cd. There are some very good tracks on the cd but also alot of filler songs.
3,....eh,"I've been waiting along time for this album to finally come out. And i must say this is a good album, but not as good as i thought it should have been. Most the songs i downloaded off the internet before Team Sleeps release were really good, but hardly any of them were on the album. Eh.. Whatever its pretty good. Chino cant put anything out thats bad. Standouts: Skull is Red, Atraxia, King Dimond."
3,team sleep,A little sleepy for me. I was looking for typical Deftones. I have listened to it several times and it is on my ipod to stay.
3,All that build up was a waste of time,"Team Sleep is as entertaining as watching the grass grow. Although it has few highlights of interest throughout the cd, it's redundant. I could take the first track on repeat and get the same satisfaction for 53 minutes of music. Very disappointing for any person that respects Chino as an artist, but is not brain-washed to think he can't do wrong. This cd is going to take a long nap in the back of my library, right next to various other side projects that failed miserably."
3,Kinda weird,Its very different but relaxing in its own way.. I guess if I got more into techno or trance I could dig this more.. Still solid album just not my type of genre
5,Team Sleep Album,I loved this album! Its not heavy like the first few albums the Deftones released but more like their last few releases imo
5,Chino's Side Project,"I love the difference in this band's sound than Deftones. I only wish the original songs I heard at the show were on this. I'm not sure if I've missed a CD out there or they chose to scrap some tracks. Definitely melodic and unusual, and my kinda stuff."
2,Not for deftones fans,Team sleep is right. This band makes me incredibly sleepy! Being a deftones fan this band is very dissapointing to me. Chino you've let us down!
4,Not What I Expected But Still Enjoyable,"I originally ordered this, along with ""Ocean Dreams,"" thinking it would be a new age music CD. As it turns out, while it does have some music it's 50% sound effects and ethereal keyboard sounds. It is an ""ambience"" CD, not a music CD, and I wish they'd make that clearer in the product description. However, having said that I enjoy it as an ambience CD. It's great to listen to while napping or writing."
2,Ocean Disapointment,When i bought this cd i was looking for some David Arkenstone music like Atlantis or Citizen of Time but the only music i could found on this cd was a bunch of tubular bells and other metals but without a tune so as you can see this cd is an atmoshpheric sound cd just like the ones in which you can hear 60 minutes of whales... so thats why i'm not recomending it.. in the other hand i could recomend you Atlantis from David Arkenstone... That's a great cd!!!
2,Good adhevise baaaaad tube!,"So I got this today to seal some water leakage around my faucet and it worked perfectly until the bottom of the tube ripped open and a big chunk of it drop on the sink. Not only the paste itself is irritating to the nose, eyes, skin, etc.. it is haaaaaard to clean... if you think it goes with hot water and soap you are wrong... but that's not the main problem because the label talks about those. It takes some pressure to get the paste out and you would think the tube should be able to handle that kind of pressure!"
1,Product explodes out of container,"I bought this to fix a pair of boots because the soles and worn down and I didn't have time to take them to get rehealed. However, when we tried to use the product, it leaked out the top and got all over the place. Very hard to clean up and got all over our hands."
3,Needed a Silicone Glue for Household Repairs of many items,"Henkel 908570 Loctite 2.7-Ounce Silicone Waterproof Sealant, Clear. I was surprised that with as many ""plastics"" that it does not work with, nor metal, it did not state any of this on the 'site information or ingredients' section. Had I known, I probably would have continued looking. Was just as surprised to see how well it does with pressurized water (up to 325psi) and heat (2,500-3000 degrees [somewhat]), and will use it anyway. But knowing that there are many types of plastics and many regular glues that will not work on them, it would have been best to know which ones this did not work for before purchasing. Not really dissapointed as I am sure it will do for many other items, but when you need somthing that specific...."
1,Container burst on the other side and silicon all leaked out at first use,"As soon as I opened the silicon from the box, screwed the plastic cone shaped thing, cut off the edge and started using the silicon, I noticed that the silicon did not flow out that easily, and I had to really press on the tube to get it out.I was about half way done with my job (I think I used maybe 5-7cc of the silicom), I noticed something on my hand...The other end apparently burst and silicon was leaking out the other side... a big mess and I don't think I can use this twice!What a WASTE of money!!!!"
1,Can't even get in,"I got this for my ferret and the hole in the front isn't even big enough to get in, not to mention it's made out of very cheap and thin fabric. Would not reccommend, it's practically unusable."
1,Uncomfortable Shoe!,Very uncomfortable shoe. Very little padding at the top and sole and they will wear blisters in the top of your feet in short order.
5,Durable comfort,"I've owned a pair of these in the black for about a year, and I have been extremely pleased with them. I wearing them in both casual and work (construction) settings, and they have performed quite nicely. I see other reviews with complaints about durability, but I have had no such problems. Now as I said, the pair I have is in the black, so I suppose it is possible the other colors' materials have issues. They are extremely and comfortable out the box. The availability of wide sizes is a nice touch too. I have such a pair and it makes all the difference."
4,Comfortable & affordable.,"Needing to spend a good deal of his day on his feet, these shoes are comfortable, supportive & better yet affordable, maybe not especially good looking, but comfort trumps all."
2,Not so great after all,"When I first recieved these boots I thought ""not bad for $65.00 or so"".After wearing them for a few weeks trying to break in the left one a littlebit due to a bunyun. I find that there is no wear streach going on like I wouldexperience from a leather western boot say. I ride a Harley and started to see athin top layer of material flaking off the shoe where the shifter lever rides,and where ever the lace eyelets rest against the tongue. These boots are coveredwith a thin vinyl like layer that comes off rather easily. It is a dull gray colorunderneath. I think the material these are made of is Cheezy at best. I won'tbe back for seconds."
5,Great product,Definitely enjoying these boot. I work 10 to 12 hour days on my feet and these boots are comfortable all day long.
3,Not exactly,"Very hard shoes and the size is a bigger than normal (M feels like E), I had to put an insole to fit just fine"
1,I'd rather read honest Anti-Catholicism than this!,"If I could give no stars, I would! I would rather read a Jack Chick tract - at least he's honest enough to admit that he hates the Catholic Church. Mr. Kaiser is a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" in this book - he starts out talking about how he reported on Vatican II and throwing an occasional George Weigel quote on Pope John Paul II in to lure us into thinking it will be an interesting book on the Church and the succession. But no...he goes on to tell the reader how awful Pope Benedict XVI is, personally and as a churchman, how JPII wasn't all he was cracked up to be, how Francis Cardinal Arinze, an educated and intelligent man, is a smiling dunderhead and on and on. Sorry that the Church hasn't moved in the direction the author wants, but that doesn't make it wrong, now matter how much Robert Blair Kaiser wants to think so! The only good thing I can say is that I took it out of the library and didn't waste money on it!"
1,Another Lumen Gentium groupie....yawn...,"Non-Serviam oddities like Kaiser are not interested in what the documents of Vatican II actually say, they're only interested in what the ""Spirit of Vatican II""(TM) intends, which, conveniently, coincides with what they already think.What sort of objectivity can one expect from this book? Turn to page 68. The ""Jesuit turned journaist"" makes no effort to hide his disgust for the new pope: At one hyperbolic point, he writes that the then-cardinal has ""wolverine rings under his eyes."" I suppose Kaiser's nasty remarks about having dark circles around one's eyes,(due to age, infirmity, allergies etc) is supposed to be the best argument for his Jesuit/Marxist vision of real Catholicism."
1,Dismal renegade wishes up Newchurch,"The Church hasn't changed -- we still despise the things and pleasures of this world in favor of charity and sacrifice. Everything passes away, except charity, which endures in eternity. Kaiser, in contrast, whistles up a notional church in which everyone is free to follow their own desires -- oh, I mean conscience. In Newchurch, conscience means carnality. This is how nations fall, folks. Follow your bliss and blow off your neighbor."
5,"Roses in December, Aliciia L. Maggio","This book is without a doubt, a must read for any woman going through the trials and tributions that most marriages bring. However, Roses in December is clearly written not only for the newly married couple, but any couple struggling with the horror and total disbelief, a woman would feel when finding out her husband that she loves so deeply; is a Sex Addict and sleeping with anyone and the only criteria is: Must be female. Age was not even a significant barrier. This book can be a quick-read, but I would recommend that anyone that reads Roses in December,to take their time and use the Reflection pages and take the time to pray. The author, has incredible strength, a true Woman of God and she found her answer and solace through the messages she offers in each chapter. Thank you - I am sorry you had to have any Decembers like this. You certainly turned those many months of an overcast, dreary December into a beautiful Spring that I know you deserve."
4,Great fictional novel !,"One of the best known novels by Cardoso Pires, it gives an account of the comtemporary social life with great sobriety in a dry and witty style. A good book,dense and critical with a touch of ""neo-realism meets existencialism"" to it."
1,Frustrating Customer Service,"I can't comment about the product itself but can tell you that the customer service on this product is not good. I mistakenly ordered the product twice and needed to cancel one of them, and tried repeatedly to call the company. NO ONE answered the phone for the returns or existing order department. Honestly, I hung on for almost an hour. When I tried calling sales, I finally reached someone but they quickly transferred me back to no man's land. I called back AGAIN and the person told me that maybe that department was ""out to lunch."" I called back AGAIN to sales and finally got a nice man to help me cancel one of the orders. This was honestly and all day affair. I hope the product that does come is worth it, if it comes!"
3,Print Quality Thumbed Down,"I enjoyed the previous FF Masterworks editions as they gave the classic stories a new refurbished feel not seen originally when they first came out in print. Unlike DC comics then, up and coming Marvel used a somewhat inferior printer where the colors were not as dynamic as DC's. The masterworks series exposed the true and potential beauty of the artwork and made the stories dynamic.Alas, this 6th edition of masterwork, as commented by another reviewer, used a poor quality paper almost akin to newsprint, not the high quality semi glossy paper of past editions. Thus, the black shades are not as vivid as they have been in the previous volumes.What a shame, the stupendous artwork and stories suddenly looked pale, stale and tepid. A great disservice to Lee and Kirby..."
4,Paper quality lacking.,If you are buying volume 6 you don't need me to sell you on the quality of the contents of this affordable masterworks edition. What bugs me is that the paper they are primed on seems to be just a step above newsprint. That is all. Love the rest of it.
1,Poorly done and overpriced,"This run of Fantastic Four comic books by Lee and Kirby, of course, is great. HOWEVER, this Masterworks collection is something of a rip-off. First of all, the suggested retail of $49.95 is up $15 from the price they had a year ago on other Masterworks. Secondly, the reproduction of the artwork is subpar... not to mention outright terrible at times. Worst yet, the inking job by Joe Sinnot is many times obviously ""touched up"" or completely re-done by another inker (Steve Leiloha?). Half the beauty of the artwork in an FF comic book is Joe Sinnot's inks over Kirby's pencils. That beauty is completely lost in these reprints. Don't buy this Masterworks. Go to a comic book shop and buy the original copies of these comics... if you go for the ""good condition"" (as opposed to ""mint condition"") comics you'll actually pay LESS than if you bought the Masterworks edition."
5,Nostalgia!,"I love this CD. My favorite song on it is the incredibly goofy Turkey Lurkey Time. It's just such a silly, over the top version. My husband thinks I'm insane. But then I explained *why* I love this CD and that song. My mother had this CD when I was a teenager. We had some really, really difficult years in my teens when she was a single mom raising the two of us in tight circumstances. One of my happy memories of those years was being in the car with her (and sometimes my big brother) during the holidays and her playing this song and driving through the snow in the dark. It's weird and special."
4,great book,wonderful photos of the man in actionvery movingsometimes sadbut always profounda great biographical photo representationworthwhile purchase and read
2,Awwww,"While the skate tool is on track for functionability,the molded plastic main body broke on day one."
3,Basic and not up to date,"This is a very basic introduction and leaves out adequate coverage of object relations and Self Psychology which are breathing new life into Psychoanalysis. (Kernberg and Kohut)A better introduction which covers much more and is more readable is Anthony Bateman and Jeremy Holmes ""Introduction to Psychoanalysis"""
2,I don't remember ever getting this book.,"I order a lot of textbooks from amazon. I have a textbook from Brenner called ""History and Systems of Pyschology"" but I do not think I ever received this textbook... or ordered it... so I really hope I didn't pay for it!!"
1,boring and outdated,"Everyone in our class hated this book, it was just so boring and the information was antiquated. I think psychoanalysis has a lot to offer, but if you introduce people to it with this book, they will hate it!"
4,"Clear, concise","Needed this book for a ""Psychoanalytic approach to literature"" class but was interested on the subject of psychoanalysis anyway. It provides good detail into the fundamentals of psychoanalytic theory. It isn't difficult to understand."
3,A basic exposition of Freudian pschoanalytic theory,"""An Elementary Textbook of Psychoanalysis"" (ETP) is an explanatory introduction to the fundamentals of traditional Freudian psychoanalytic theory. Brenner faithfully remains close to Freud's thoughts using terms seen infrequently today (e.g., parapraxis, cathexis, dream censor). Averring psychoanalysis a ""scientific discipline,"" ETP focuses on the presentation and defense of Freudian psychoanalysis buttressed by many examples. Noteworthy is the careful attention given to avoid an anachronistic presentation of ideas. Beginning with the foundational hypotheses of psychic determinism and unconscious mental processes, the majority of the book delineates drive theory, the psychic apparatus and dreams. These chapters comprise its most valuable parts. Though originally published in 1955, ETP's enduring quality is perhaps attributable to Brenner's disciple-like adherence to Freud and his pedagogical motive."
4,Nice learning toy,"I purchased this toy to make a physics presentation. It works fine, but the weight of the external components limits the ability to do certain things which can be done with a lighter design. Nice appearance and sturdy."
4,Well made,This is way better made than those little dual packs you can buy. It comes with the string to wind it up but it is a little tough to wind becasue it also have a plastic zip strip type handle to use instead of the string whose gear takes space. The zip strip is only about half as long it should be though.
3,it was decent,"i bought this gyro because i appreciated the physics behind how it works. Anyway, the two screws that you can see are aligned vertically hold this thing in. I had at first thought there was a rod traveling through the axis to hold it in place this is true. I found this out because i dropped it on the floor by accident and had to put it back together. The tie string used to spin the gyro is hard to put on. I wish the string had a smooth end for easy setup, instead it is a nylon string with the end melted (not smooth)"
4,darbuka,"I am very happy with this drum! The sound and quality are wonderful! I was worried not being able to hear it before purchase, but found it excellent. Only problem is that I'm used to standard doumbecks and have had to get used to the difference in shape and balance. Doom's are powerful and tek's and ka's are sharp. Enjoy!"
3,WHAT IS A JEW? WHO IS A JEW?,"Rudi and Ester Reisel believe that the Bible and Jewish philosophy can provide the essential unity that so many Jews long for. The questions that have plagued Jews since the emancipation (""Haskalah"") are ""what is a Jew?"" and ""who is a Jew."" Or perhaps a better question...why be Jewish at all? In this respect, the Reisels provide more answers for the latter question based on their grasp of Jewish history. If someone is looking for rational and non-traditional reasons to sustain their Jewish identity, then this book is a good attempt."
2,Worth what you paid for and thats it,The cover was gray. It has holes in the top to let water in which is dumb. it was a cheap plastic-y material and blew off with the wind. Its fine for 15 bucks but not the greatest cover. i also paid for 2 days shipping and didnt get it for 3 days. so waste of money on the speedy shipping.
3,Intex 10ft Round Pool Cover,"The cover is plenty big enough, and covers the pool well. However, the string tie that you pull to secure thecover over the pool is not really good at keeping the cover on in the wind. Would recommend that the cover havean elastic bottom or some sort of rubber gripper to keep it on. Cover was very inexpensive so it will do for now."
1,Poor Quality---Cheap---Not Worth The Money!!!,"I purchased this product and the first thing that I notice when I took it out of the box is where a tear in the cover had been poorly repaired by the manufacturer. The first time I put it on the pool, the eyelets started coming out of the cover and then the cover tore while stretching it to fit the pool. I contacted the seller about this product and they did not make any effort to replace the cover. The cover is made of very, very thin tarp material. This is the poorest quality product that I can remember purchasing. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Seller did not send product as advertised.,"Seller did not send me the 10 Foot Intex Above Ground Pool Cover as advertised, they sent me a cheap cover that is of poor material and does not fit well with the 10 Foot Intex Pool. Not an Intex product. Cheap Material. Not worth the price. I hate it."
3,A tribute to Dr. J. Crane AKA Scarecrow,"If your a fan of the scarecrow, you're gonna love this! This book includes Scarecrows oldests and newests crimes, like ""The 6 days of Scarecrow"". Trust me, if you don't like Scarecrow now, wait until you see 'Batman Begins'. That's right, he's the villian! Buy the book, see Scarecrow on the big Screen, and enjoy Scarecrow Tales by ???? ?????. This book is awesome! Come See, Twisted Jon Crance beaten by Batman and Robin! It'll bw worth the cost of the book!"
2,Too cute; sounds like karaoke.,"I was initially charmed by Petty Booka--two cute Japanese girls singing a Ramones song Hawaiian style? Ha! That's great!However, the novelty quickly wore off. The engineering on this disc makes it sound like cheap karaoke music, which I found a little irritating. In addition, the cover songs are funny, but like I said, the novelty wears off pretty fast.This CD would be good for parents with small children, because it is awfully precious and I think little kids would find it fun. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. I really don't think that anyone could listen to this CD frequently enough to justify the purchase.The bottom line is, Petty Booka is cute Japanese girls performing Hawaiian ukelele music. Only you can know for sure whether this is something you'd enjoy."
5,The Best that Julia has Done,"I just love this contemporary novel, and I can't wait for the next book of the trilogy. The characters Julia has built stand out and you feel that you know them personally. Jake is the epitome of a girl's dream man, so thoughtful and caring, yet still a ""man's man"". All the people in Robin's family are such individuals that you want to keep on reading about them. I think this book is the very best that Julia has written Shejust keeps getting better and better."
2,Just didn't do it for me,"I really do like Juila London's style and appreciate her voice in romance. I read ""Beauty Queen"" (second book in series) and I really enjoyed it. ""Material Girl"" was a bit disappointing only because I didn't like Robin at all. She has no redeeming qualities and was annoying to me. Kinda like Carrie from Sex in the City. A birdbrain who thinks the world should revolve around her. Jake was ok. I had such high hopes for this plot but it just didn't pan out. Too dull and do we really care about the parents.....I know I don't. The story didn't move along as I'd hoped. I did like the pace of the romance however, I just didn't like the heroine.This would not prevent me from reading other Julia London books. I really do like her style."
1,"Paid for, but never got, the book.","Always wanted the book. Bought the book. Got a totally different book, but not the book I ordered. Those selling this book have a problem with their code system and even though you get confirmation that you have ordered ""Diaper Days of Dallas""...it is ONLY true in writing because what comes in the mail in not ""Diaper Days"". It has been tried twice. I still want the book. But I am not going to pay again to have the same thing happen. There is not a human to talk to that would just fix the problem and it takes too much time to do their business for them.Beware trying to get this book, their system is messed up somewhere.Sure needed this book last month, and still do."
5,great poet,"Sandburg was a superb poet. he speaks in such a raw voice, that the poems cannot help but to reach out and touch you, whether he writes about love, injustice, protest, war, chicago or any other subject."
1,Heavyweight,"Balsa supplied with model is too dense and heavy. Consequently, the finished model is too heavy to fly with the rubber band supplied. For model to fly it should be lighter, about 1 ounce, and have a stronger motor."
1,Nice if you can get it opened,"This review refers to the plastic ""cookie jar."" The cookies are good, but the cheap plastic cookie jar has a lid that is almost impossible to get opened. I finally managed to open it by working a screw driver under the edge to pop it open. The jar is not suitable for reuse as either a cookie jar or a kitchen cannister because of the difficulty in opening the top. If you are buying a gift, I would recommend one of the other products. I would note that the cannisters all have very tight fitting tops (I ordered two others besides the cookie jar).Maybe this is the latest in childproof lids. A young child would have extreme difficulty getting the container open."
3,The drama house on mango street,The house on mango street is the center for all the drama in the king williams neighborhood. sandra cinseros is the resident to whom all the drama is around. she has changed the color of her home to what she believes to be tenjo colors. the house patrol(as i call them)says since she lives in a historlical redsident and they say what goes then she needs to pick another color for he home or they will take her to court and prove their point of view.
4,Loved this book,I personally liked this book. It reminded me of the times in which I was growing up in the Bronx. I also would sit outside with my friends and look at the stars. The people from other neighborhoods would come into ours and would be very afraid to pass by because they also didn't know any better.
3,"A reader from New England, October 10, 2000","When my teacher handed me the book, The House on Mango Street, I thought it was going to be great . I did not think this because of the cover but because of my parents. They had told me that the book was very good. To me the book was very confusing in different vignettes. It was amusing at some parts like in the vignette Our Good Day. It was also very well written and interesting how she wrote the book. I like how she makes you think and that everything she says has something hidden behind it. I also enjoyed the metaphors. There were good things and bad things about the book, that is why I gave it a three stars."
3,House on Mango St.,"House on Mango St. is a very interesting story. She tells you alot about her history. This story is the basis of drama. Sandra has problems in her vicinage which is King Williams. She is very perplex about the hue of her house. She wants to color her house a certain color, but the owners of King Willias will not let her. Sandra has a dilema."
5,great tool for those of us who want to improve our skills,"I own a plastercraft store in Arkansas and am always looking for new or interesting finishes. ""Fresh Paint"" is right up my alley since I do custom finishes and have to come up with new looks to keep my customers coming back."
3,This is not the ultimate reef book.,"This is an interesting book, and contains some impressive photographs, but I cannot imagine anyone would seriously compare it to Delbeek & Sprungs two books. It is much less comprehensive, is somewhat disorganized, and is not nearly as well reasoned. The authors give huge amounts of space to subjects of comparatively minor importance (algae species, for example). If you want one book that will tell you everything you need to know about reefs, this isn't it. If you already have every other reef book, this is worth a look."
2,Not doin' it for me...,"I keep returning to this disc thinking, hoping it will grow on me but each time I'm able to make it through less and less of it. The playing is, no-doubt, virtuosic and credit is due for using original compositions. However, other than `wow they play fast' and `gee that sounds tricky', I find nothing here that moves me emotionally. Furthermore, the production is very slick and I don't care for it. The fiddle sounds too smoothed out and the guitar is too high in the mix and has a high frequency hype that I find irritating.I realize these are two highly respected players and certainly some will and do love this cd, but I wanted to state an alternative perspective so that others may know that this is not an automatic go-to great ITM disc as others have professed here."
3,Disappointment,"The intro was excellent, so after reading the sample on Kindle, I decided to order it.The author promises to bring the reader authentic Native Canadian names, but instead lists random vocabulary/words from various indigenous languages that are most likely not used as names in those cultures. She also prefaces it by saying that true Native names are too sacred to share with the outside world. Great. Then why say you have authentic Native names when you obviously do not.She also did not go much into Quebecois names, she only had a few names, and most of them were ordinary French names, when early census's have whole lists of interesting and unusual names used by the early French settlers.She is a talented author, but the book was lacking in terms of ""Canadian"" Names."
4,Cute graduation present,"This a good graduation present, with money, of course. It is lighthearted, and may have some helpful tips."
4,What teachers' don't tell you.,"I felt this book was a fairly quick read. I read it in one night.Its funny, and gives you many good tips from how to choose the perfect mattress to how to avoid the walk of shame.A lot of it were some good points how to know if your school is right for you, when are the best days for visiting.If you were to read this book I would reccommend spending an hour at Barnes and Nobles and reading. I mean its good, but that $14 could have been spent somewhere else."
4,A Good Worst-Case Scenario Book for Your College Student,"If you've never read a Worst-Case Scenario book before, read one. Each one is highly irreverent in its own way. This one has practical advice like ""How to Ask Your Parents for Money"" and ""How to Avoid Going to the Wrong College"", but also has goofy sections like ""How to Put Out a Microwave Fire"".Even the goofy sections have practical advice, although hopefully your college student will never have to use it.These books are a lot of fun. Check out the others, also."
1,Not so useful,It's not really a useful book. Really no good information in it. It is mostly a lame attempt at snarky humor. Should be filed under humor rather than college guidance.
2,Just...mostly dumb,"I read the reviews for this before I purchased it for my Kindle. I was excited to start reading some of this advice, but once I started, I wondered why I even bothered buying this. Most of the tips in this are pretty stupid and just obnoxious, and the ""good"" advice were mostly just common sense things anyway. The only part of it that I enjoyed and found useful was the section on how to put out a microwave fire. Obviously, others enjoyed this though, so maybe it just depends on the person and their situation. I mean, I know who my roommate will be, and I won't be having to use a public bathroom, just for some examples. Also, some of the sections that other reviews are mentioning weren't inside my Kindle version, so maybe I'm missing something..."
4,Leatherman Squirt P4 -- excellent for its size,"Excellent utility from a small size keychain tool. Don't expect to use it for heavy-duty work -- go with larger multi-tools instead. For its size, it has a wide range of screwdrivers. The pliers is the main tool and is spring-loaded. I don't use the knife -- I still carry a Classic Swiss Army Knife that I still use for the knife and other tools. It is a bit on the heavy side compared to a Classic Swiss Army Knife, but it has a lot more tools as well. Overall, the Squirt P4 is very handy in an office/computer environment."
4,leatherman squirt,"Excellent. The best pocket knife I've ever owned, with the emphasis on pocket. It's rounded corners and small size make it comfortable to carry. And at the same time, it is a real tool. The screw drivers and pliers can really get things done. The blade is acceptable, and the file has been useful as well."
5,Gift item,"I purchased this as a gift specifically to replace one my father had lost. I'm not sure about how it compares to other less expensive brands, but this is the one he wanted. He likes it because he can carry it in his pocket and it is always handy when he needs it for quick responses to small problems. I would have liked it if the price was a bit lower but was willing to pay for it because of the specific request from dad."
4,An alternative perspective to Roy's,"Insofar as these reviews might tilt you toward or against purchasing a CD, I'd like to offer another perspective to Roy's impressions above (and suggest that beauty must be in the ear of the beholder). To my ear, some of these works are among the many particularly good recent releases by singer/songwriters. Land of Milk & Honey, The Red Thread and Afterglow are my favorite releases of Ms. Gilkyson, Kaplansky and McLachlan. 2004 has been a fantastic year: Mindy Smith, Patty Griffin, Norah Jones, Lizza Connor... And try Tori Amos' post-911 recording -- really nice."
2,Ok I know her politics,"After listening to this album for a few years, I can say that I have finally come to appreciate it more (after disliking it initially). Perhaps that fact that we are STILL fighting in Iraq and my own changed view of that disasterous war has made it easier to listen to her politicized lyrics."
5,Another (Audiophile) Gem,"OK so I have a thing for well-recorded, enjoyable female jazz vocal. This recording has both attributes. If you're into Jane Monheit, Kendra Shank, Natalie Cole, Diana Krall, etc. ""Autumn Leaves"" will not disappoint. This is good jazz singing. Jacintha's voice is not seasoned with age but she's well on her way. This is an analog recording and it's proof positive that there's nothing lacking in analog whatsoever."
4,Remarkably sensual vocalization,Inver knew Jacintha was Singapore born and raised. It is unusaly for an oriental singer to attempt jazz cocals and do it so well. Her voice is subtle and sensual. The backup is a bit weak in this album.
1,Don't bother,"This is the latest in a line of boring 1st person shooters that attempt to approximate war. You will spend much of your time with Iron Storm reloading saved games. Many levels actually require you to die several times in order to reveal where the bad guys are. Save, get shot, reload, takeout sniper, repeat. How is this fun?BTW, enough with the game reviews by people who couldn't get the game working. Your computer ineptitude is not relevant to the rest of us."
4,A Gamers Review,I have played many games...lots of World War 2 games and other FPS games. This game takes the cake of being the most unique game that I have Played. It's fun and enjoyable. But the graphics are not up to par with the newer games out like FEAR and Half Life 2 but I would still recommend that you try this game out.
1,"Move over Microsoft, Dreamcatcher releases junk too!","I bought this game (original-off-the-shelf) and went home to load it up. Installed great and when I went to play it... it would not work. I am serious! I spent hours going through the readme files with a fine tooth comb and they will tell you in the same file that THEY KNOW the game will not run with the majority of sound and video cards on the market. I patched the game and even installed it's included safe mode drivers (Yes it comes with a safe mode version- so what does that tell you!) and it still didn't work. I patched it- nothing! Wrote customer support and they said that they are aware; and I quote, ""Like yourself, we are very disappointed at the problem you are experiencing and are working hard to correct this"". So the bottom line is that they realeased this product loaded with bugs. It is a waste of money for people to buy it!"
4,Looks like Dreamcatcher hit a home run!,"With all the junk Dramcatcher puts out, it finally looks like someone got fired! This game was entertaining challeging and alot of fun. I can only hope they get the message and continue on a new line of quality games and hopefully with less bugs."
5,A funny and touching play,"I saw this play performed in San Antonio several years ago and I've been longing for a copy of my own. The dialogue is absolutely hilarious, though the play deals with a girl who's being led astray by her boyfriend, and the concern of her single mother and her two grandmothers. A scene involving a crossword puzzle becomes a critique of each woman's lifestyle. These women have very different personalities and must overcome the communication barriers they've created for themselves before they can work out their problems. An excellent, moving, and very funny play."
5,The Perfect book--Give it 10 Stars,"It is not possible to say enough good about this book. The profound emotional resonance of the story, the music of the language, the elegance and intelligence of the writing are simply unsurpassed. This book is my desert island book, my solace, my heart's delight. It is the rarest of rare things : a book which needs no corrections and cannot be improved upon in any way.You do not need another synopsis of this book; you only need the good fortune to locate a copy.I am a lifelong reader and an editor by profession. I am not given to either frequent or extravagant praise. I buy every copy of this book I am able to find and give them to friends who have been exceptionally good in several lifetimes.If you should find a copy of this book I urge you, dear reader, not to hesitate, but to embrace your fortune and read this book."
5,Comfy,"This Tank Top is comfortable, and seems like it was made from meterials that will last a long time. I have washed it several times now, and no colors ran nor did it fade. All is all very good product, and the delivery was fast too."
3,Dries too quick,The product works great as long as you use it in small sections but becomes tedious to use for large boats because it dries a little quickly to work on large areas without using a lot of product.
2,not as good as it looks,"The material was pretty thin, but the main problem was the length of the leg's the one's i got weren't much longer than regular brief's. For the price they should have been made from a heavier material,"
4,Great live album,"This is a re-release of an album called That's Live, released in 1985 by the German label INAKUSTIK. The sound is OK, and the band is really good. Especially bassist Robbie Burns who is an extraordinary musician. But they lack one piece - they should have had separate keyboards/guitar, one man on each.Well, the songs are quite cool. Especially the first 4, they're the best on the album. One really funny piece is the cover of Bruce Springsteen's Factory. Here referred to as Working Life. I've never in my entire life heard a better bass-solo, and I've heard a LOT of music. Eric's singing throughout the album is quite good, although he is as hoarse as a crow and sound almost 10 years older than he was when this was recorded. But that's actually quite cool, I think, and it certainly gives the songs a different touch. Well worthy of owning!"
5,Excellent Struts Reference for beginners,"On an overall index, I would rate this as an excellent struts reference for beginners. The book is very well organized and easy to follow. If you are new to Struts, this is probably the best book around but if you are an experienced developer you would probably want to invest in something more advanced."
4,Let this be your struts primer,"If you are about to start learning the struts framework, then i would recommend 2 books, start your learning with this book (the complete reference) and finish your reading with : Jakarta Struts Cookbook.This book does a good job of describing the various elements of the struts framework individually with a Demo that builds on as we progress through the chapters.The second part of the book is a manual for the tag libraries. The example usage of individual tags with attributes is very helpful.This is something that lacks in the usual java documentations.The explaination for the dtds (struts-config,validator,tiles) is also helpful.The author has also build a utility (which is available for free download from his site) called the ""struts console"" which is a gui tool to configure the dtds.Parts 1 and 3 are good for learning while part 2 servers as a good reference material."
5,Can't go wrong with this one,This book presents the technical information in a straight forward and organized manner that is useful to a first time Struts user such as myself. The first portion does a fine job to describe what Struts is used for and how the pieces fit together and the second portion is superb raw reference material. Great combination.
5,well done!,This is a great book! It certainly made getting up to speed on Struts easy. I looked at alot of the books on Struts and this one seemed the most complete. I'm pretty happy with it and it turns out some of my co-workers had the same book and the like it too.
3,A good book for beginners,"I've developed non-struts web applications, before I bought this book. This book is good at providing basic concepts and syntax. I could get a good grasp of struts, but just with this book alone, I could not have survived at work. The examples are buggy, information is in-complete.I've other books like Jakarta Struts Cookbook (Bill Siggelkow) and Struts Recipes by George Franciscus, Danilo Gurovich. These books would help you more, if you understand the Struts concept."
2,Already Out Of Date,"Why publish a ""2nd Edition"" on Struts in December when the next generation of Struts was just weeks away from going GA? Instead, you should really focus on looking into Struts 2.0, which is a complete overhaul of the architecture.Folks have been complaining for years about the deficiencies of Struts, most of which have been addressed by 2.0.Do yourself a favor and wait until the inevitable avalanche of books that will come out in the coming months on Struts 2. Another option is to purchase Manning's WebWork In Action which details the framework that Struts 2.0 is built on."
3,for beginners only,"this book covers the basics of struts, the validator package, and tiles. However, once you learn the basic concepts of struts, the single mini hr example (ie, ""hello world"") is not enough for you to be able to write a real world app. You need to go somewhere else. This book is for beginners only. For 50$, I think you're money would be better spent on other books."
5,Excellent!!!,"As soon as I began reading, I was really drawn in. The characters are very realistic and the story is exciting and interesting. I literally could not put this book down!!!I read alot and this is one I would reccomend to my friends."
5,Great replacement,I was rehabing an older 21qt cooker and wanted to make sure I had a good working gauge. Worked and fit like a charm. Nice high quality piece.
3,"Good, But Could Have Been Better","The Pioneers of Primetime has great production value, but is to short. The subject should really have been covered as a documentary not as an hour long show on the subject. The interviews with the Old Time stars where great, but should have dug deeper into this marvelous time in show business history. Though uncredited, I know the tremendous amount of work Steve Z did to bring this show about. Chin up! And as Red Skelton would say ""May God bless!"""
5,Pioneers of Primetime,"Interesting, though short, telling of the beginings and early evolvement of ""must see TV"". All the early greats are here; Bearle, Skelton, Caeser, Ebsen, Hope, O'Conner, et al. Really wish this was longer. I received an advance copy and thoroughly enjoyed it. The program is approx 60 minutes with extras that include extended interviews. Now, I wish someone would produce a series on vaudeville."
3,Housework,"They are easy to install, Holds all my belts, pulls to see what is there without pulling all down. Bought two and think they are great"
2,CHECK THE MEASUREMENTS!,"I bought my shelving @ Home Depot. I figured all closet shelves are probably about the same and this organizer would be great. But not true. No where does it tell you that the clip on the front that hooks OVER the shelf is made for a 1"" lip (top of shelf to bottom on that front lip). My shelves are 1.5"". So it won't work. Also the assembly has a tack weld so you really would have to ""break it"" to remove that clip if you want to create some sort of hanger yourself. Unfortunately I accidently ordered TWO of these and can't use either one. Too much trouble to return them so I will break them and wire tie them on.... oh well...."
2,Does not work with every wardrobe,"Something that is worth mentioning about this product is that it requires a tray like the depicted for installation. I didn't have one in my wardrobe, so I'm currently using the one I had in my microwave. Other than that the product works well enough. I mean, it's not rocket science or anything :)"
4,Works for me,I have a lot ties and this worked well for what I needed. I wanted something that didn't require batteries and wouldn't stop working in the future. My ties are organized and the sliding feature is nice to get those ties in the back. It also doubles as a divider in my closet for my wife to know where my small side of the closet starts. (Not that it helps that much in that regard.)
3,Don't bother,"I purchased two of these. I broke the first one installing it! It's cheap plasticky-metal stuff that really isn't worth it. Then, it's difficult to decide where to install. It won't fit wherever there's a hanging rod. The shelves don't allow the ties to hang straight. And, it just doesn't seem that sturdy."
4,"Easy to install, excellent space saver","This is a nice product that really saves space in my closet. Before, I would hang ties and belts from a hanger--a really inefficient use of space. Now I can easily sort my ties and belts, and they don't fall off the hanger anymore. Installation is very easy. All you really need is a screwdriver and pliers or a wrench. The only problem I had was one of the hooks was too long and prevented me from hanging the rod evenly. As it stands, there is a slight (maybe 15 degree) tilt to the rod, but I've noticed no problems with that. If you need to better organize your closet, this is really handy and cheap tool to use."
4,"Great for ties, maybe scarfs, belts - not really","Overall, I thought this accessories does the job. However, the belt is a bit misleading. If you try to hang the belts like a tie, the belt if really too thick and doesn't bend, you'll be lucky to fit 10-12 belts on there, not the 30 advertised. For ties, it's great.If you assemble this in the middle, it takes up a lot of room actually. Vertically, it'll take up 2 shelf spaces, and you cannot have any hanging bars.The trick here is the make the shelf where you want to use this and overhang it on the side by 2 rows, just enough to click this tie hanger on. So basically it's on the outside of the entire shelving. This way, it wastes no shelf space at all."
3,"Easy to install, does what its supposed to do","We like that it keeps all the belts off the floor, it does need a little bit of space all around, so figure on 5"" of width for it."
5,"Looks great and works great, too!","We are nothing but happy with this closet organizer. It took a little longer to install than I thought but, on the other hand, it was easier than I thought it would be. There are several closet organizer brands out there, but we will choose Rubbermaid Configurations if we choose to upgrade our other closets."
3,Decent for the Price,"This is not a bad product. The product does not hold ties comfortably since it is not wide enough. The tie would be hanging from the thinner side and will slip off. However, the rack is wonderful for belts! If you're looking for a tie-rack; don't buy this product. If you're looking for a belt-rack; go no further."
3,"Nifty, but flimsy, solution","At first I was very pleased with the Rubbermaid Tie and Belt organizer. Yet, after a couple of weeks of use, my assessment has waned.The flexible metal ""V"" in the rear that secures the organizer perpendicular to the shelf is flimsy and broke within two weeks, with only 3 belts and about a dozen ties hanging on the organizer.I fashioned a heavier one out of some heavier gauge wire, and it's working fine now.I would definately advise you to get the organizer, but handle it gingerly when sliding the extension in and out of your closet."
3,isn't universal,"This product is good, but not universal. My wire shelf must be a bit thicker than what the product was designed for, so it hangs at an angle which causes the bar to slide out on its own. If you have the shelf it was designed for I would give it 5 stars. The belts stay on the hooks and their are plenty of them."
4,Perfect!,"This is a great product!If you have ever dumped out an entire drawer searching for one bra in particular, this is a great solution."
4,My tie are no longer wrinkled!,Great solution. It slides out to make it easy to get to everything. The front hook does not fit the wire shelving in my closet all but I got it to work just as well with the use of some zip ties.
4,Fun and Entertaining..but...,"if you're looking for a ""sailing video"" this is not it. It's a fun video without the ""nuts & bolts"" of sailing/cruising info--lots of clips of scenery and people, with some interviews from other cruisers. Good music, although at times it competed with and distracted from the actual video. The extras with Mitch commenting on the making of the video were fun to watch."
1,Not worth the time,"As a sailor and a confirmed lover of videos, I had high hopes for this. Unfortunately, the other one star reviews are spot on : this is not worth the time it takes to watch. Very little footage of actual sailing, and what there was seemed to me like motor sailing or just motoring. Almost all the footage is in or around Georgetown in the Bahamas. The people who made the video and the others interviewed look to me like the typical margarita-drinking sit-on-your-boat-in-the-harbor types. The music by Eileen is good, but you could just buy her CD and look at pictures in sailing or travel books and be happier.I wish there was a good cruising / sailing video out there, but there really isn't (unless I've somehow missed it). Blue Water Odyssey is much better but still not great. Irving Johnson High Seas Adventurer and Around Cape Horn are awesome but not 'cruising' videos. And the others I've seen are really instructional in nature, and vary widely in quality."
1,Disorganized Mess,"""Being Out There"" is one couple's attempt at presenting the cruising life style, and encouraging hopeful cruisers to just get out there and do it. Mitch and Michelle are fairly appealing as presenters, but the material is very thin, often with poor sound quality. Images and sequences are repeated in different places to pad out the content, and there is only a sketchy idea of a beginning, middle and end. The only bright spot in this video is the music and lyrics of Eileen Quinn, who really does capture the elusive essence of the cruising life. Don't waste a dime on this one."
2,Home movie to music,"[...] The basic message is ""if you ever planned to sail, go for it,"" but no practical information is imparted and the musical background will not appeal to a wide audience."
3,Somehow fell a little flat,"Although done with good humor and having made a good effort to include a good variety of different perspectives, this is still an amateur-produced film. I'm not aware of any competing film that is professionally-produced, though-- comparing to the Pardeys would probably be unfair, since they are much more about nuts and bolts. You never see the film-makers actually sailing-- they seem to use their motor a lot. Maybe they found that there is too much spray to film while actually sailing. The musical interludes, with photo album-type scenes to accompany, drag a bit, and the continuing choruses in the interviews of ""freedom... freedom..."" and ""paradise... paradise..."" both get a little old.It's an honest effort, but it didn't really grip us the way we hoped.(Please note: this DVD does not have closed captions or subtitles.)"
1,Being Out There,My wife and I were very disappointed with the content of this DVD. We were expecting actual at sea footage but this DVD is mainly interviews of couples who go out there. It was a mutual admiration society thing.
3,"Encouraging, but not as inspirational as the Pardeys","I got this DVD along with Cruising Has No Limits. This is worth a once over. But it didn't make me want to get off my bum and go like the Pardeys did. Of course that might not be a fair comparison as they show some really exotic footage in Africa and Ireland, places I would love to explore. The views here may be too close to home."
4,Endurance Dish Rack,I absolutely love the disk rack. The only problem is the water doesn't flow out of the bottom like the plastic racks. I have to physically dump it out so it doesn't gather on the bottom.
3,Doesn't hold enough dishes,"Looks good, but I was expecting it to hold more dishes than a cheapy plastic one. I would say it holds less dishes. Seems to take up a lot of space on the counter for the amount of dishes it drys.I wouldn't by this product in hindsight...."
3,Not essential at all.,"If you are an Aerosmith inconditional it is essential because all the albums are. If you aren't is not essential because the only two good songs (Draw the line & King and Queens, which saves the album)you can hear it in ""Greatest Hits"". Draw the line is an amazing song that takes you to the top and i like to hear it when i'm drunk. Bright L. F. and Get it up are so boring and repeats these lines all the time, the rest are just ok. When i hear this album i can feel so much drugs and alcohol on it."
3,Aerosmith Succumbs To It's Demons,"I remember the first time I heard the song ""Draw The Line"" I thought it was the heaviest thing I had ever heard in my life at the time. I had never heard anyone scream like Steven Tyler did at the end of the song. I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but I knew it was something unique. Unfortunately after the title track this album does not live up to it's expectations. Draw The Line was where the band really started to slide and although there are some good tracks here, the overall quality of the album is not on the level of it's predecessors. ""Kings And Queens"" is a good track, and I have also always liked ""Sight For Sore Eyes"", but the rest of the album is very very average. Some of the lyrics are downright stupid....even for Aerosmith."
3,"Bluesy, boozy, coked-up, sloppy rock n' roll","I wish Aerosmith could re-record the songs on Draw the Line now that they aren't stoned out of their minds. I would love to hear how good this CD might have sounded. The songs here are no where near the heights of Rocks or Toys in the Attic, but they are not bad either. The problem is they were so coked up when they recorded Draw the Line that it sounds crappy. The playing is all over the map as is Tyler's voice. Sometimes he sounds strong and others cracking and completely out of tune. This was unfortunately a band in decline and releasing this a year after the masterpiece Rocks was a major disappointment. Still Kings and Queens is a great song and Draw the Line, Sight for Sore Eyes and Milk Cow Blues are also strong tracks."
5,They Got The Funk - In A Good Way,"I don't know how they got som much funk into this album, but they did, and the funk delivers in spades. This is definitely not ""a truly horrendous record"" as the early reviews imply - this is great for the Aero Addict who likes a little funk mixed in with their blues infused rock. Don't listen to the bad reviews on this one - buy it, bring it home, and CRANK IT UP!!"
4,"The whole is less than the sum of the parts, but...","...I still like it, regardless. Like it a lot, in fact. There is some really good material here, definatley worth checking out. True, this is no 'Rocks' or 'Toys in the Attic' but it has its own unique charm. My favorite songs here are the title song, I Wanna Know Why, Critical Mass, and Kings and Queen, which was written by Joe Perry. Pick this up, keep an open mind, give it a chance, and maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised."
4,"Great Album, Awful Remaster","Draw the Line is an underrated Aerosmith album. It features some classic tracks: the title track, ""Kings and Queens,"" and ""Critical Mass."" Tyler's vocals are raw and gritty, the musicianship dirty and energetic. The problem is the CD remaster (done in 1993). It is terrible. The music sounds muddy and compressed. Shame on Columbia Records for not lavishing more money on one of rock's most important bands by releasing high quality remasters. It is 2007, and this remaster is now 14 years old. It is time to have all new remasters of all of Aerosmith's albums done with the same quality that Capitol Records did for Grand Funk Railroad, and Rhino Records has done for countless other bands."
3,this showed them slipping...,"""Kings and Queens"" hands down rocked. It was an awesome song that carried most of the album. The rest, was formulaic, drug induced bleh-fare.But, even the mediocre stuff was easy to listen to...even if forgetable."
3,Living on the edge,"The album that signaled the end of all that was good about Aerosmith...this is their last complete studio album as the original line up since Joe split the band during recording of ""Night In The Ruts."" All of this acrimony aside, it is a solid effort and much better than what was to follow. The title track, a great slide-based song, is one of those Aero ""classics,"" and kicks off this uneven album. The first four songs are pretty good and ""Bright Light Fright,"" a silly song, shows a preview of Joe's later Project work. The Wagnerian ""Kings and Queens"" is still as breathtaking as when I first heard it, and the album closes out with a rocking cover of ""Milk Cow Blues."" Nowadays, they may have released this with select songs from the follow-up to produce a 60 minute ""single"" CD, but alas that is not the case. Given that the next three albums were often quite bad, this is a fitting end to the original incarnation of arguably America's finest rock and roll band."
3,I WANT to rate it higher but...,"I just can't.The title cut and ""Kings & Queens"" are the only songs here that I like,maybe ""Sight For Sore Eyes"".The beginning of the long downward spiral."
4,Grittier and more classic,"Everyone wants to tell you how this album isn't as great as previous efforts or how it doesn't stack up to their late 80's material. And they are primarily right, but this single album alone contains some of the more rawness that Aerosmith set out to accomplish. With bluesy hooks and strong guitar hooks and solos, this album delivers.""Kings and Queens"" is truly the stand-out track but ""Draw The Line"" makes a great companion with it's fast-paced raunchiness it's a promise that Aerosmith delivers.The rest of the album surround these stand-out tracks and actually compliment the aura surrounding the music of Aerosmith, even if you consider this album a loser in ways.It recieved 4 stars for this promise alone. And as mentioned before - ""Kings and Queens"" is the absolute stand-out track and needs to be placed in the highest regards as far as what can be considered an Aerosmith classic."
3,It's ok except for two songs,"I would like to start of by asking what was the band thinking. Bright Light Fright is insturmentally cool. The vocals suck. Get it Up. I don't know what was going on during this song. It goes no where. Draw The Line, Kings & Queens, and Milk Cow Blues are really cool and the rest are pretty ok. The earlier two should not have been on the album."
3,Aerosmith - 'Draw The Line' (Sony) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1977,as I remember the very day this lp came out.Not as outstanding as their landmark albums 'Toys In The Attic' or 'Rocks',but STILL a decent effort.Tracks I dug the most were the opening title cut ""Draw The Line"",""Kings And Queens"",the blues-like ""Milk Cow Blues"" and the late night FM radio(at that time anyway)""Sight For Sore Eyes"".Nice to pull off the shelf and give a spin every now and again."
2,Mixed Bag,"Like many other reviewers, the band was in decline on this batch. The record starts off strong with the gritty Title Track and I Wanna Know Why(probably the best track on the collection). However, afterwards its very much hit and miss with more of the miss quality. Kings And Queens is fairly creative at elast with some noteworthy piano, strings, and Tylers best vocal performance on the record. Get It Up is a cool track but the rest is mediocre or even abysmal. Choose Toys in The Attic or a compilation isntead."
3,Aerosmith flames out,"I remember really looking forward to getting ""Draw The Line"" when it first came out, and then sadly wondering what went wrong with one of my favorite bands? There are two good songs here, the title track and ""Kings and Queens."" After that, things are strictly by the numbers. I mean, from a band that was all about sex and excess, why the heck were they singing a song that was about when you ""Can't get it up?""History has revealed that Tyler and Perry were pretty much out of their heads by now, and it shows in the writing. ""Bright Night Fright"" (with Perry on vocals) is an attempt to punk out, but ""Toys In The Attic"" was a punk song before the genre was defined. ""Milk Cow Blues"" completely misfired, the band's attempt at boogie came off as half hearted. Had it not been for ""Come Together"" on the greatest hits album that came a year later, I would have just given up on Aerosmith after this record."
5,Review about NITRIX,Good product. Excellent vaso-muscular volumizer. But a little expensive. Good perfomance. For me is better taking it in tablets. NO XPLODE must be in tablets too.
3,Gives you energy,"I read up on all kinds of Nitric Oxide products and this one seemed to fit me best. So I ordered it. I took one pill just to see if I felt anything. I did. A huge boost of energy that lasted about 3 hrs. I couldn't sit still. I probably have a sensitive system so it doesn't take much with anything. I know I have to be careful. But the bottle says to take basically 9 pills a day. I would have a heart attack! One to two pills a day does me fine. I have plenty of energy on one. Geez, I couldn't imagine taking 9. I just started on this so the outcome is yet to be determined. I am hoping for the best.The pills are huge. And I have a hard time swallowing horse-like pills. Luckily the pill can be broken up very easily."
1,Placebo?,"This product did pretty much nothing for me. Maybe it didn't work because I did not stack it with anything, but I'm already used to taking some vaso-dilation pills without a stack and feeling ""pumped,"" so why should I bother with these?"
3,Had better had worse,Wasn't that impressive. The ingredients sound powerful but even after taking 5 I didn't feel powerful or get bursts of energy. Will not buy again.
2,didn't see any difference,I lift weights and take a few supplements but I haven't noticed any difference with NO in either performance during lifting nor results after. I actually had high hopes for this stuff. Maybe it works just not for me.
5,Tried and True,"Here's the deal; there are so many NO products in the market that it's hard to tell what from what! At the end of the day, Nitrix has been around for a long time and it's STILL best in class, in my opinion.I've found that the extra ""discipline"" required relative to taking it on an empty stomach 45 minutes before a meal HELPS manage a sound Bodybuilding Diet.Bottom Line: NO supplementation is BASIC, AND there's no need for a thermogenic effect other than pre-workout for this old-dude.I can say without reservation that this will BLOW your blood vessels out and have you VASCULAR as all get-out if you're below 10% BF!Stick with a winner and buy THIS for your NO needs!"
3,Nitrix review,"Seems to create a decent pump, i'm stacking with NoXplode, but i seem to have gotten more cut and it lasts all day. it's something to try, and for the money it seems to give some results. i'll probibly get another small bottle until i decide to try something else."
1,I WISH HAVE IT IN MY HANDS,SINSE LAST MONTH I BEEN WAINTING FOR TRUE MASS AND THIS THIS PRODUCT NITRIX IT'S 4/12/2012 I'M STILL WAITING AND I GOT NO ANSWER FROM THE SENDER I NEED MY MONEY BACK OR THESE ITEMS NOW!
1,It din't work,"I took it like the sticker said, 3 pills 3 times per day with an empty stomach but i never felt that super energy and the volume on my body"
4,Works,I started using this along with N.O. Explode and a BSN protein shake/meal replacement. The combination of the three has given me a significant increase in energy allowing me to do more reps and more weight without that shaky feeling. No side effects here.
5,it doesn't discriminate,"Guys, this is the best vascular dilator I have ever used. The pump I get is incredible and, it doesn't discriminate. What that means is that I get the pump everywhere and it's a lot cheaper than Viagra."
2,Better options available.,"The price on Amazon can not be beat. But the hard to swallow pills (they are huge) and the dosing frequency and conditions are a pain in the rear end. I still have some left, because I found that just taking L-Arginine powder was more effective, cheaper, and easier to take. I don't know what fillers are in Nitrix, but there must be a bunch because I get way more effect from less product in what is supposed to be a less effective form. Go with the A-AKG powder or L-Arginine powder - it is available on Amazon or locally. And much cheaper and more effective. I wouldn't say this product is horrible - it is just way overpriced, less effective and harder to take. But - as the biggest pro, it comes in a very shiny package. LOL"
5,Big difference for me,"I have cycled this twice now and I can say for certain it makes a big difference for me. In less than two weeks with this stacked with cellmass and no-xlpode, my pumps, endurance, and strength all improved quite a bit. I've actually looked in the mirror and laughed because my biceps were so pumped. Both times doing this combination, I had to loosen up my iPod armband because the regular setting (before and in between cycles) was too tight and I actually popped the thing off my arm a couple of times because the pump was so much in my biceps. I've tried just the no-xplode alone and didn't get the same pumps, but did get most of the energy. Flat out, I'm sold on this and plan to continue using it. I guess it may vary from person to person, but it sure works for me."
3,Nitic Oxide Boosters,"In order for you to get the full benefit of any Nitrix oxide product you must take supplements to boost the product. Use these products which can be brought from your local health store. Pycnogenol this a potent anti oxident flavonid that increases the activity of N.O., Citrulline which another amino acid that helps detoxify the liver and promote energy boost the N.O. even greater, Ginko Bilaba lessens the stickness of platlets around the time of workout and increases blood flow to the musles. Vitamin C which is an antioxident. All these have anti oxident and free radical fighting propeties which prevent cancer as well. Follow the recomended dosages and take with NO products."
2,Caused heart to skip beats at times ...,"Took the product for a little over two weeks. Seemed to start doing what it advertised but I started having issues where, at times, my heart would skip a beat. This issue seemed to get worse until I basically quit taking everything (vitamin, fish oil, low dose aspirin, propecia, protein shakes and Nitrix pills). Not sure if it was a reaction to something else I was taking or what. After a week of not taking anything, the heart issue went away and haven't had a problem since. I am now back to taking a vitamin, propecia and fish oil and everything is okay. Although it seemed to start doing what it advertised, the heart thing freaked me out too much so I'm going to stay away from it."
3,Warning! Users with Tinitus,"As a first-time user of this product (BSN Nitrix Advanced Vaso-Muscular Volumizer, 360 Tablets), I took the suggested dosage (3 tabs)and within an hour experienced a dramatic seven-fold increase in tinitus sound activity. While I've had this medical condition for nearly 15 years, it's under control and I'm almost never aware of the constant inner ear ringing. Two days after taking that first dosage the excessive ringing subsided but I will try the product once more to validate the original experience or reject it as a fluke. I will post an update later but users with tinitus should be aware of this potential complication."
1,Nitrix hasn't done anything to me,"I've been using nitrix for two months and can easily say it ""It doesn't work"" I like BSN Syntha 6 though"
5,Seems to help,"Good product, it really seems to help make your muscles a lot harder and feel tighter faster than without it."
5,Great Supplement! Actually Works.,"This is a great product. I am currently on my second bottle and it works great. At first i was hesitant about it because I am not one that likes to take pills but i got tired of other supplements that didn't work. I've tried NOxplode and the amounts of caffeine mess you up but Nitrix has no bad side effects that I have noticed. My bench press went from 195 to 235 in 1 month. You still have to work hard in your workouts.Nitrix prevents you from being sore for the most part, gives strength,energy, and made it easier to get back in running shape most importantly since I am a runner. It even helps down there for the guys haha. Great product and i highly recommend it.P.S. Don't let the price scare you. The product last a long time and works so dont think you are over paying because it is totally worth it."
4,Intriguing collection,"While this is not this finest selection of Dean Martin's recordings, it has a number of songs which are not usually included on easy-to-find reissues. It's a filling addition to a collection of Martin albums. The cheesy intro to ""You can't love 'em all"" is practically worth the price of the CD. Any true Martin fan will find several cuts to love on this one."
4,A good read.,"Though I have not read all yet, what I have is a good read. Some themes remind me of Larsen's ""The Devil in the White City."" With Olympians reading 50 Shades of Grey, perhaps more would be interested in reading it's older sister!"
1,Waylon Jennings Sings Hank Williams,This was a great disappointment. Waylon must have been in the bathroom and the muscians in the lounge when this recording was made! I love Waylon Jennings but the vocals are so distorted and the music so loud that it was very hard to tell who was singing. I'm sure if the recording had of been better quality I would have loved this.
3,'Wayland sings Hank Sr.,"It is ok, but I didn't get sold on this album totally. He still sounds like Waylan and his beat on some of the tunes. If you like Waylan you might like this ok."
3,Good For Young Readers,"I purchased this book wanting a good biographical account of Nikola Tesla. Though it is that, what I didn't realize was that it is really aimed at young readers (ages 9-12). Nothing on the cover or the introduction mentions that fact. The odd book size(wide format), the larger font size and the limited vocabulary give it away as a juvenile selection. I would recommend it highly for that age group. However it was not the adult biography I looking for. I think I will give my copy to my son. I believe he will enjoy it."
4,extension kit,pro: great price. including shipping.con: Having purchesed this exact opener extension before I expected it to be the same great design as before. I was disappointed to see the design change. The new design is a bunch of slide together tubing used in conjunction with the original OHDTrack. I have yet to install this opener
5,Fabulous & Fable-ous!,"Maressa and Merlone is a magical fable - an adventure led by the daredevil Princess Maressa who is later joined on her journey by the handsome and determined Merlone. I must admit, though I loved all the characters in this amazingly produced story - Winchester the Frog is my favorite. Shaeri Richards has succeeded in creating a tale that is ""fabulous and fable-ous."" When you analyze the tale by going below the stories surface, you will realize that universal truths are enforced and weaved within to teach but not preach to your children. It did not surprise me that some reviewers totally missed the mark with their comments. Ignore them. Ms. Richards talents reach out to gently pull in the listener.Your children will fall in love with the entire cast of characters in Maressa and Merlone."
1,Poor Quality,"Product arrived quickly however the front tire tube had a hole in it which I needed to fix (kit $2.00 or new tube $5). The location was in the center along the inside rim of the tube. The pedals are not easy to push at all. For our two-year old, it is hard to pedal and it shouldn't be. Appears as though the pedal shaft axel is bent. The fix would be to relace the part or the bike.It is a nice looking bike but I'm afraid I cannot recommend it. Certainly be sure to assemble and test it out before telling or showing to your child."
1,BUYERS BEWARE: Sony VAIO NV170 is a toy,"Even though this unit has a great display it is a terrible buy if your a business user. It will not support any other operating system than Windows XP Home, Sony does not offer an upgrade path(even to XP Professional), there are no drivers available for the hardware configuration. Buyer's beware, this unit is not for business use. Sony does not support this product!"
4,Good album,"This is a good album, but not to the extent that the first Offerings was. This is more of a quiet album (where Offerings was more rock.) It's a good album, but I like the first Offerings better.UPDATE: LATER ON 12/19/08The more I listen to this album the more I like it. I have upped the stars to 5. I'm hooked. I loooove the almost subliminal salute to U2 in ""Medley"" with a partial rendition of ""With or Without You."" I am still liking the first Offerings more, but this one is slowly creeping up behind it. Good job Third Day!"
5,A Must Have,"Offerings II is an amazing worship album. It is full of powerful praise and worship songs.There are so many great songs on this album that it is hard to pick out favorites. Certainly 'Show Me Your Glory' and 'God of Wonders' are amazing. Beyond those, there are several other tracks that are outstanding. Mac Powell's distinct voice, the instrumental talent of the band, and the worshipful lyrics are a powerful combination.This is a must have CD for anyone who likes worship music and/or Christian rock."
5,Third Day passes the plate,"Third Day has outdone themselves with a moving follow-up to their first worship album, Offerings. Offerings II is anything but redundant, pushing the listener even further into the presence of God. Those who are familiar with the band's music will find their expectations exceeded with this project. For those not familiar with Third Day, these two worship projects are an excellent place to start. These guys truly have given all they have to give."
5,A Great Cd that Rocks,"This cd like Offerings I contain both live and studio music. The cd rocks, I love Show me the Glory and Nothing Compares to you. The cd ends going back to their first cd. I love listening to the whole thing."
5,Awesome!,"If you liked the first Offerings album, you'll love this one, too! Third Day has amazing musical talent, AND they glorify the Lord with their talent! They are an awesome rock band."
5,"Third Day, Does It Again!","Third Day, puts out another great album. This is a great album for all music lovers period. Christian or not, this album is a must buy! The band's lead singer, ""Mac Powell"" can sing it all: Country, pop, rock or whatever. These guys are talented and blessed by the Lord! I'm also excited about the new Randy Travis album coming out on November 11th, ""Worship and Faith"" This album has Mac Powell from Third Day, doing a song with Randy. I give offerings II, 5 stars!"
5,I recomend to anyone!,"This CD is amazing. Yes, it may have some of the same songs as previous albums. But this is one CD that is hard to get sick of. I went to Guatemala this past summer and the only CD we had brought was Third Day offerings 2, we listened to it every waking moment we could, it was so amazing. Even if you are not a big third day fan, it seems to me that it would be hard to not worship along with them in ""offering"" and ""show me your glory""."
5,"Great, solid effort. One of the year's best.","To start off, you should know that I do not purchase a lot of Christian music, mostly because it is extremely over-produced. I came upon Third Day by listening to a local Christian station, and bought it after hearing 1 song. It is a consisten, yet diverse effort, with everything from slow melodies, to real rock.The lyrics are thoughtful, and singable, and I would highly recommend this album to anyone, especially for people looking for a REAL Christmas album. Of course, this album is not a Christmas album, but it is praise for the Holy Trinity over and over, done in a great fashion."
4,Good follow-up to the first,"This album is a great worshipful album, with mostly slow to medium tempo worship songs. ""Creed"" is probably the most uptempo song on the album, and I find it a bit jarring in the context of the album. It's a great song, but doesn't seem to ""fit"" where it is in the album.This is not a great CD to rock out to, but I think it is a great Third Day CD, and the perfect companion to the first Offerings."
3,Not up to there usual standard,"This cd has just failed to grab my attention. In my opinion this is their worst cd. Offerings I was a lot better. I just found most of the songs not catchy or corny. I am a much bigger fan of all their earlier works. A lot of people like this cd, so you will just have to listen for yourself."
3,offerings II ( not there best effort),"This is a descent cd, but it lacks the feel of offerings I had. Some of the songs' lyrics seem a little corny. I would definetly advise buying the offering I first."
3,The modern part is not included,"The overall content of this DVD is fine. It goes through a desert town with water supply, rising due to Hoover Dam, Bugsy and the mobs, Howard Hughes, the fires of MGM and Hilton and the challenges of Atlantic City. Then it stops here in spite of its being released in 2005.This is disappointing since it is kind of distant from what we see today. After I've visited Las Vegas twice and watched this film, a gap is certainly there and I just cannot bridge them together. I'd like to know more about Steve Wynn, how these latest casinos are built, what they look like inside...etc.So if you really intend to know the history of Las Vegas, it is a fine piece. But if you are in the case like me more preferring in the modern part of Las Vegas, you should leave it aside."
2,Too long!,"The DVD was well produced, but it would have been far better if had been edited down to less than an hour. There was plenty of information, but much of it was told over and over. A condensed version would be great."
1,Writing style - Secret and mysterious,"It's a good thing that John Parker knows what he's writing about, because the reader most certainly will not. The book lacks any visible structure. Paragraphs jump from one topic to another, apparently related to background information, but failing to explain the relevance. Reading accounts of historical figures and events should be intruiging, even fun, and not as boring as this book.The life and death of Captain Robert Nairac is one of the most compelling stories related to the Irish troubles, regardless of which side you're on. That being said, it is a pity, that the author fails to live up to the vast potential of this particular topic, especially considering that he tried to glorify the memory of Captain Nairac - as the title implies."
4,"all I am saying, is give CURSED a chance","I can't believe I'm the first person to review this album. This one's too good to be overlooked.Cursed reminds me of a slightly more rock n' roll version of Converge. It's still hardcore, it's still metal, but it's rocking too.I knew I loved this album the first time I heard the first track. It starts off with a killer crusty guitar and drums intro, and a sample of a terrified woman saying ""there's body parts, arms, legs, eyes, brains, entrails, lungs, everywhere"". The album never lets up from there.Three more tidbits about Cursed One:* Released on Deathwish records (Jacob Bannon from Converge's label)* CD case itself is printed on high quality black paper with awesome black and white artwork by (guess who) Jacob Bannon.* Some magazine proclaimed them ""THE LOUDEST F--CKING BAND IN CANADA!"" and I would be inclined to agree."
5,What are you people listening to?,"I gotta agree with the other reviewer. Why hasn't this been reviewed by more than two people? What are you people listening to? This Canadian band is slowly gaining the recognition it deserves in underground metal circles. Turn off the Top 40 crappolla, or whatever it is you little freaks are listening to, and start banging this! Crank it at all hours of the morning to irritate the neightbours, and if you find yourself being annoyed by it, then either a) metal isn't your cup of tea which is fine or b) if it ain't on the radio then you don't listen to it or know about it, and you don't deserve to listen to this."
1,This is the last Robbin Hobb book I read,I started reading the trilogy a while back. The first book hooked me. It was a fare read and I took a few days of free time to finish it. The next I found I had trouble reading. It dragged but I could see a goal and could wait for it to come to appear. Oddly Some things seemed rushed. The third book seems to ramble. I had a hard time to even finish it. so many pages were wasted on plot points that were neither interesting nor moved the story forward. It almost reads like a stream of consciousness composition. It is clear that the book swelled to over 700 pages because a filter wasn't applied to rough ideas.
4,An emotional installment,"The Farseer trilogy are some of the best books I have read in my life. Many have gone into detail about the books, so I will just quickly sum up my experience.This trilogy grasped me and would not let me go. I was completely immersed in the world and the joys, and mostly agony, of Fitz. This last book in particular was extremely emotional and painful for me. My heart ached at the events in the book, especially towards the end. Although I wish things could have ended differently, I think the end that I wanted(and by the look of other negative reviews, many others) would have been a little too cliched and hard to believe. So overall, although it left me with an aching heart, I am pleased with this book. Hobb is a magnificent author and I am looking forward to reading the Tawny man trilogy."
3,almost there... AAACK... missed it!,"Seriously... there were some good parts in this book... first half or so maybe?Overall the series lost what I thought was important in the first book, the building of the character and importance of the Fitz.I don't think I would recommend 'finishing the series' to those who've read the first two books.UPDATE:I removed the spoilers even though they were clearly marked."
5,"No pleasant, but real life ending","I agree with many of the other reviewers. It is a great book, the story is enthralling and the end uncompromising. I was fascinated by the idea of an hero who really endures and though deserving receives hardly nothing at all personally. love ends,he loses many of his friend and his health, although he saves the crown and mankind. Fitz remains, as is often mentioned in the book, the catalyst of the story, and does not , as usual in the young prince who wins the crown and the girl. All those people complaining about the end, perhaps criticize its true greatness: not to give in to the easy, usual fantasy concept of sugar endings.It is tragic and I nearly cried frustrated.Does anybody remember what happened to Frodo in Lord of the Rings; III? Fitz fate is just as sad and lonely in its depth."
1,Anticlimax and the long road to nowhere,"This book revolves around the characters being twisted up emotionally continuously and talking about it a lot. It's a very long journey for them and you to the climax of this story, and when you get there all the exciting stuff is paraphrased. Reader beware! Stop with her first one which was excellent and imagine it was a stand alone. I was tricked and bought the rest of Fitz series 1 and all of 2 after the first book and greatly regret it. Fitz especially is feminized as most of her male characters are and it's hard to swallow. Why didn't she just make the protag a woman???????Sorta spoiler BEWARE!!We must find the dragons! They're sooooo important, it's soooo hard to make them, soooo much sacrifice.... MANY MANY PAGES of buildup.... and then one chapter of ""the dragons did this"". Fitz wants out of all this, hell so do I."
2,Why Oh Why,"I don't understand why the author would write a third book for a trilogy that discards almost everything set up in the first two books, including most of the characters. This book feels like the beginning of a new series, not the end of one, and slogging through the pages in which nothing of note happens is so frustrating that it almost feels like the author wants to alienate the reader.I'm around half-way through, and although I've never done this in my life, I think I may just put the book down because my burning desire to find out what happens to a character in whom I've invested so much time has been burned away by the tedium and plot-holes of these 400 pages. Or, after reading the other reviews, I may just jump forward and read the end of the book so i can have my unsatisfactory ending and be done with it."
2,A disappointing conclusion to the trilogy...,"The previous books unfolded a whole new world in almost a ""realistic"" way. The concluding part, ""Assassin's Quest"", ruined that illusion. The first part of the book, of Fitz going after Regal was the same good quality reading that was the lifeline of the previous books. Then Fitz started hearing ""Come to me..."" and everything went down. The last 2/3 of the book was actually boring! Traveling stories and frequent beatings soon caused me to lose my interest, and the ghost cities with Skill-rocks and -roads, carving dragons and becoming one yourself, just didn't fulfill the expectations I had for the Elderlings... The best chapter was the last one, explaining what happened after the ""epic"" part of the story was finally finished."
4,"Pretty good, but who is her editor?!!!!!","I really have enjoyed ready Ms. Hobb's books. Great characters, really good story line. I would recommend these books as brain candy to anyone who enjoys a good escape from reality novel.HOWEVER! My only complaint is on the unfortunate use of poor english. I find it nearly unforgivable that an author AND editor let the ""word"" irregardless be used!!!!! OMG!!! And the use of ""these ones""! ARRRRRRGH!!!!! Did somebody not go to their basic english class in high school!"
2,Why did it have to end so poorly?,"The first two books in this series were awesome. I usually dislike when the hero gets ""reset"" and has to start from nothing, especially multiple times. However, Hobb did a fine job with the initial books.Assassin's Quest ruined it all. Nothing 'exciting' happens during this book. Walking, talking to one's self, more walking, and finally wrapping up 3 books worth of questions in the span of a few pages made me almost sorry I'd read it.It was well written, but ended so horribly I'd suggest anyone interested in the trilogy stop after reading the first two."
3,"Well writen, but i dont think it needed to be a trilogy","This series started out with great potential, then I feel went downhill, through 2 1/2 books we watched our main character's (Fitz) life crumble around him. I didnt enjoy watching Fitz's life get more and more depressing, especially in first person. I found the ending to be everything id been waiting for during the last three books, and beleive that this series would have been better if Ms. Hobb had condensed it into one book. Then we wouldnt have had to go through a thousand plus pages of hoping Fitz would do something worth reading."
4,"I was hooked to the end, but felt it wasn't the end!","I started reading the first in the trilogy and just had to keep going. I normally read 20th century novels and so I was surprised to find that these novels had me hooked. However, I did not expect the end of the Quest; no I didn't want a ""happy ever after"" ending, but I did find that there were some avenues that had been ventured down, but not taken to completion...Too many questions and I was also left with despair and not satisfaction."
5,Excellent conclusion to a superb series,"I read this series straight through, something I rarely do, because it was so good. Hobb has developed her characters very astutely - I found myself feeling for them and caring far more than many other authors in the genre (Kettricken's love for Verity is excellently done for example and shows both the hapiness and pain of the emotion). The ending left a lump in my throat and thus makes it all the more memorable - the notion of Sacrifice continues throughout. The plot moves at a steady decent pace that keeps bringing you in that little bit more to Fitz's world - the last pages may seem rushed but thats because Fitz's own role is coming to an end. It is his story. Without a doubt Hobb is the best new author I have come across in years and unhesitatingly recommend you to discover her."
5,A great conclusion to a great trilogy,"The main problem with fantasy literature is that after reading Tolkien, you tend to get spoiled. This trilogy, however, lived up to my high expectations. The main character is well portrayed, and the conflict is so well drawn that you are there with Fitz all along the way. Now, some people have complained saying the ending was too unhappy, but I disagree. Fitz finally gets a life of his own, free of royal intrigue and conflict, which is what he always wanted. I highly recommend all three books."
2,Drawn out in excruciating detail then it's over,Very disappointing. The book is drawn out detailing every thought and interaction of every character for some 700 odd boring pages. The finale was abrupt and disappointing.
3,I was dissapointed at the ending,"I absolutely loved the first two books of the trilogy, but I was very dissapointed at the ending of the third book. The plot seemed to disintegrate, the characters went and did things that they never would have done in the beginning, and we exit the story with the knowledge that the main character will probably never do anything interesting for the rest of his life. Overall, I recommend this series to anyone who likes fantasy, but don't become too attachted to the story because you will be just as dissapointed as I was."
3,What a shame ...,"What a shame ... Prepared as I was for the tragedies that Fitz would have to suffer, the intros of both preceding books were clear enough, I never expected this. That could be a compliment, since it certainly was not predictable. However I feel a little betrayed. I don't like dark fantasy and this last book came so terribly close. There are so many loose ends, the explanation of the major plot is weak. Then, why could I not put it down while reading it ? It could have been among one of the best books I ever read. What a shame ..."
2,Drawn out than quick to end,"Pages and pages of drawn out details of one singular quest. The first 730 you get to know every thought of every character, what they ate, drank and wore day by day than just when you think something is going to happen....it does'nt. The last 27 pages wraps up the story in a hurry in an ending that is totally unsatisfying. I would not waste my time on this one unless you just feel you need to wrap up the trilogy."
3,300 pages too long!,"The first two books in the trilogy were, to summarize, very good. This one carried on a single poorly defined quest that had every step of the saga itemized and described for you. OVER 700 Pages that should have been better used. Explanations to questions along the journey were awkwardly held from you, I guess to generate suspense, in my case frustration. Unfortunately for me the mediocre last part of the trilogy diminishes the first two books if you consider the story as a whole."
2,Doesn't compare in any way with books 1 &2,"I waited months to read this book and when it finally came out I was so disapointed. I thought the beginning had so much potential, but it was simply wasted. The plot is engaging for the first half of the book, and then goes completely downhill to the point of being very tedious and very boring! And why does Fitz have to end up alone after such an epic! After reading 2000 pages how can that ending satisfy anyone?!"
4,"The final installment is a bit weaker than the first two, but it's good nonetheless","""Assassin's Quest"" is the final book in the Farseer Trilogy, and while I greatly admired the first two, I seem to like this one a bit less. Some of the scenes tend to drag (few of which look like filler), and the ending is fairly unsatisfactory (it goes on way too quick, and it doesn't really wrap up in a smooth manner). Still, it's a worthwhile conclusion to the trilogy: it still has action, adventure, drama, adult situations, and a little bit of dark humor. This, along with the entire trilogy, is a whole lot better than other standard fantasy novels. It avoids many cliches, and it manages to make us care about the plot, characters, and even the environments. I enjoyed reading all three novels: the trilogy is an underrated marvel.Grade: 7.5/10"
4,Danger: Addicting,"In this third installment of the Farseer Trillogy I must say, I think this book was easily the worst of all of them but that didn't make it any less addicting. I had to finish it as quickly as I could to quiet the insatiable book-lust overtaking my mind! It tidies up the ending rather succinctly, leaves an opening for another series (which I guess there is already one), and was overall not quite what I expected. But what can I say? If you have read this far you might as well finish up the trilogy!I selected 4 stars because I truthfully enjoyed all of the books and the plotline. I wasn't absolutely thrilled with the ending - it seemed almost rushed, while other parts of the book seemed to drag on. But it was still a good story and still frighteningly addicting! A realistic conclusion to an epic fantasy escapade!"
5,I made my kindle print larger to keep the ending from coming,I started reading this trilogy because the first book was free. I quickly became hooked. The hero is definitely put through the wringer. I did like it that the ending was not a fairy tale happily ever after but still satisfying. I am on to Robin Hobb's next trilogy as soon as I can press One Click.
2,What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!,"I enjoyed reading the first two books in the Farseer series. This final book dragged and dragged and dragged and dragged. I wondered if Fitz and his companions would ever find Verity. And when they did ----- NOTHING. It is as if the author and editor had no ideas for character or plot. The book died along with the personalities of the major characters. Then to end the 3-book Red Ship war with a 3 or 4 sentence hindsight . . . and the red ships were defeated. Unfortunately, I have already purchased the first book of Hobb's next series prior to reading Assassin's Quest. I wonder when I will have the courage to open the cover."
2,"Good start, depressing ending","I read a LOT of books and enjoyed the first book very much just like I enjoyed Robert Jordan's first book in his ""Wheel"" series. But this series, like Jordan's, just got more and more depressing.Maybe life really is all that depressing, but I read to enjoy and relax, not have sad feelings follow me around hours after I put down a book.I will really have to check out reviews of Hobb's next book before buying any more of her books."
3,Assassins trilogy,Great trilogy. The ending needs a bit more though in my humble opinion. He acts as an old hermit when he is only 30 years of age at the end.
4,Riviting Saga,Has good continuiation of Fitz's life and restoration of the Kingdom. His quest isn't just to find his king but to protect his child.
2,Very Disappointing!,"After reading the previous books in the series, I was expecting more from the ending. The book was very interesting until he went looking for Verity. After that it was long and streched out for miles... Then to finish it with a tragic ending?!? After all that, I didn't find it believable that he would end up a hermit. And Nighteyes lazing around? I would think they would find a mate for him...or they would go hunting frequently, or something... All I can say is that it was very dissappointing."
2,whhhhhyyyyy?,"*Contains spoilers* Throughout the whole series the main character has suffered dramatically. Nothing in is life is meaningful except for the girl he loves. I know this isn't real life and that things don't go right and just fit perfectly, but after suffering this long for 3 books I felt that there should had been something for him. (and for the audience)"
4,Actually not as bad as some have said. *NO SPOILERS!*,"Just finished reading the Farseer books. I was impressed with the characterization and the way Hobb tied up all the loose plots. The protagonist's ending was believable. Hobb writes the story in first person, but is able to use third person to tell stories of others via The Skill. Smart lady. Her portayal of the young man who grows to a grown man was excellent. She leaves certain things out of the story until the very end which is nice. That way, you the reader, will not be able to say, ""Oh, I know what's going to happen here."" She does not tell you specific things until the very end that ties things together wonderfully. I am impressed. Read these books, and you too will enjoy them."
3,"Page turner, but with empty ending","Ever read one of those books that was a page turner until the last 10 pages? That's this book. Great suspense throughout, but the ending was empty of any detail, action or suspense. The conclusion left something to be desired."
4,"excellent, but.......","I first read Robin Hobb's Assassin's Apprentice on a whim, the book was on a co-worker's desk, and I asked to borrow it. This final installment wraps up the trilogy quite well, however the final book was definitely a bit too long. I look forward to other stories from robin hobbs and the world she has created"
2,nasty ending,"Although I loved the first two books in this trilogy (and I wrote a review of the first book accordingly), I found this third one very different. Many writers say that ending a novel is the most delicate and difficult part of the writing creative process. I don't doubt it and,if we have to judge by this trilogy, the ending can totally spoil the good time we were having so far. The only explanation I could find for the awful way in which this trilogy ends is that the writer got to hate her main character and she wanted to punish him. It is not that I only want happy endings, it is that here the author goes beyond unhappy."
1,Worst of its kind,"Most fantasy books can be described as someone lights and raises a torch in the darkness. Different books, different amount and kind of light. But your spirit soars, because there is light in the darkness so you feel good after reading the book. With the Farseer trilogy, there is only darkness in the dark and I felt miserable after reading the books. I am happy only because other people thinks these are good, so I was able to get rid of them."
2,Disappointing,"After the first two great installments in the Farseer Trilogy, Hobb bungles the closing piece. Read some George R.R. Martin or Steven Erikson and stay away from this drivel."
1,Crap (an english term!),"Pitty - the first two books had me hanging on the edge of my seat waiting for the third - and what a disappointment it was. I'm sorry Robin, u r an excellent writer, but why did u have to ruin quite possibly one of the best fantasy series ever? I await ur next (reading soon, after Otherland pt 3 - hope that doesn't go the same way!"
3,A Little Disappointing,"This series came highly recommended to me from friends. I enjoyed the first two books of the series as they both worked towards a climax, and delivered. For the third and final book (this one), I anticipated an intriguing plotline that would capture the essence of the characters, placing them in situations which would test their development.This, of course, did occur - but I found the climax to the trilogy unsatisfying. The story unfolded slowly allowing characters to be developed. The characters were tested in the end, but I felt there wasn't enough political intrigue - unlike the first two books - to truly make this series great. In other words, it just wasn't clever enough.I also felt the end of the Red Ship war didn't receive enough treatment, especially considering this was the threat to the Six Duchies, and that the quest was based on eliminating the Red Ships.Robin Hobb is a good writer and I definitely will read her future books in the hope of something special."
3,Well developed but prepare for an anticlimax,"The characters of Nighteyes and Fitzchivalry continue to develop realistically throughout the book and the introduction of new characters is expertly done. Throughout, the character of the fool remains both enigmatic and charismatic and is masterfully worked. The plot sustains itself well and makes it a 2am finish kind of story - unfortunately when one has finished the book after reading all day and all night the end is confusing, hurried and depressing. Throughout the series readers share Fitzchivalry's desires, angers and loyalties and wish to see his ambitions fulfilled. However the readers' desires go as unrequited as the main character's and explanations as to why this happens strike me as rather unsatisfying. Basically it seems all the characters I liked disappeared, became characters I didn't like or died! I hope the Tawny Man follow up series helps curb my sense of disappointment..."
2,Great 300 page book. Too bad it's 700 pages long....,"Haven't been this disappointed since I got sucked into George Martin. Love fantasy and there's so little good stuff out there. Great concept, first two books in the triology were good to great, last one was horrible. It went on and on and on. Occasionally it's good if something happens in a book, and precious little happens in this book until the last 30 pages. Not recommended. Go read the lies of Locke Lamora instead."
2,Deus ex Machina,"The subject sums it all up. I think that Robin Hobb was written into a corner and had no way out but this ridiculous ending. The first two books in this series were great, and most of the third, but I just can't forgive the end. It reminds me of Neal Stephenson's abrupt finish at the end of Cryptonomicon or The Diamond Age, but without any of the subtlety or polish that take his sudden endings and turn them into gems. A disappointing conclusion to a fantastic trilogy."
2,Get on with it already,"The first two books were great, with one exception. It appears that a major theme of the story is Fitz growing up. But he doesn't. He nearly dies in one stupid decision only to ""learn better."" Then, having survived that calamity, he moves directly to make some new dumb move. He's not really learning anything. He doesn't get smarter.Also, the trip to Verity is annoying. Go to find Verity. Get betrayed and captured. Escape. Go to find Verity. Get betrayed and captured. Escape. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. It makes for tedious reading.With all that said, Robin Hobb is a great writer. I hope the next books don't fall into similar patterning because I really enjoyed the first two in this set."
4,"Great series, good book",This series was a wonderful read for me and I really enjoyed the creativity of the author.
2,Extreme let down!,"The first two books of this series had me thoroughly intrigued. The combination of politics and fantasy had me locked in my room for some steady reading. Then this final book brought every thing back crashinng to earth. How could you rush a finish and ruin a series at the same time? 3 book limit from publisher? I hope so! I hope Robin Hobbs future contract or imagination allows for more books to do things the way they should have been, right to the final period."
3,Pretty Far Fetched Ending and the Plot Got Away,"I like the series but the ending didn't do it justice. The plot seems to have gotten away from Hobbs on this one and I think she just missed the boat.This kind of turned into one of those David Eddings ""travel"" stories where all of the tale is told over a series of long journeys. And that type of a story is over done and boring.The very end was pretty cool, a tad bit far-fetched, really far fetched actually, but it worked somehow. I think that a better resolution could have been written in a lot fewer words.We already loved the characters, we already love the plot, you don't need to re-endeer them to us with lots of meeningless dialogue."
1,Ruined the series,"Why oh why! I had people tell me this book was awful, but I thought well if it's worse then the first 2 then it will still be good because I loved the first 2 books. If you have read the first 2... stop there and imagine your own ending for Fitz because this one sucks!If you would have told me when I finished book 2 that I would not read the Tawny Man series because Assassin's Quest was ""that bad"" I would have told you you were crazy.If she would re-write this book I would buy it. Seriously, you think the book will get better and it keeps getting worse right up until the ending. I have read fantasy series where 1 book in the series might be ""bad"" but this is the first one that was so ludicrous that it ruined the whole series for me."
2,Hobb is Burnt Out,"After reading the 1st two books in Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and enjoying them immensely, I was more than just a little disappointed in the 3rd volume. Hobb appears to have burnt out. He devotes pages and pages to boring pointless journeys, opens a promising theme - Old Blood - and never develops it and his evil king character develops a split personality, alternatly swinging from evil genius to drug addeled dilettante. I finished the book but it was so poorly done I had a real hard time not just chucking it part way thru."
4,Good book and series!,"I was pleasantly suprised at how much I enjoyed this series, and this book is no exception. This book had a few chapters that were rather redundant when talking about Fitz's skilling or wit sense, but it by no means ruins the story. The story contains the same interesting characters that graced the previous volumes, with the addition of some new and likewise interesting friends. Some new developements complicate matters, and some unanswered questions are put to rest. The story feels completed when it ends instead of leaving you wondering (wich I hate.) The characters never do what you want or what you hope they will do, wich only drags you deeper into the outcome. I strongly recommend this book and series to any fantasy lover."
3,A tedious read,"While Robin Hobb has developed some interesting characters and plot lines, this book is way longer than it needs to be. There seems to be too much un-necessary waffle as if the author feels the need to over justify the actions of the characters. For example, the repetitive musings about why Fitz can't/won't see Molly again or Nettle for the first time were not needed and simply seemed to drag out the plot line. My other criticism is that the book ends with Fitz thinking about how the 'skill' is calling him - shades of Bilbo and Frodo being called to join the elves and co - very Tolkienesque."
1,Slow plodding completely narrow plot with no imagination,"After such a good first book in the series, I was disappointed with the second, but hoped it was just a bridge to a quality end book of the trilogy. The book was terrible. There was very little in the way of twists from the plot established at the end of the first book, and the author continually repeated entire paragraphs of events which spoils the narrative. The authors imagination of magic was somewhat flawed in that obvious uses that would destroy the plot were left unexplored."
3,Anticlimactic,"I would have given a rating of 2.5 stars. It appears as if the author was perfectly content with cataloging the continuing failures of Fitz for 99% of the book and then suddenly realized that she needed to wrap things up. The ending is completely anticlimactic and renders a lot of the developments and characters from the previous books, useless."
1,A terrible third book to an otherwise solid trilogy,"Hobb fails to deliver in the third book of the trilogy. The protagonist, FitzChivalry, does not have a direct confrontation with the story's antagonists. The reasoning behind the forging of the kingdom's inhabitants is explained away in roughly a page and a half. By the first third of the book, I realized Hobb would be unable to reasonably resolve all of the conflicts in the story. Very disappointing and very sloppy. I doubt that I will attempt any of her other books."
2,Ended up disliking protagonist,"While the trilogy started out wonderfully with superb character development, Hobb seemed to go downhill with this last in the trilogy. There was so much put in to make sure that the reader truly disliked the protagonist (Fitz). I found myself continuing reading simply to find out the grand finale of the trilogy, which wasn't so grand once I found it out. I gritted myself through endless encounter after encounter and disliking Fitz more and more to get to twenty pages or so of wrapup in the end. And the wrapup wasn't the slightest bit satisfying to me. There were too many questions left unanswered. Altogether disappointing, considering Hobb's excellent start."
5,Wonderful Third Book,"A stunning end to the series, full of ups and downs, and an overall exciting book! The ending didn't bother me with its shortness, as I feel the bulk of the book was spent on the appropriate subjects: Fitz finding his ultimate ""quest"", further explanation of the Skill and Wit, and the land beyond the Mountain Kingdom.I am glad to have found Hobb and more glad to add her to my ""favorite author"" list."
1,Pitiful ending to a promising series,"The Farseer trilogy was great through the first two books. This last book however was not worth the cost of the paper it was printed on. A shame so many trees were Sacrifice for this dribble. I will not muddle along as Hobb does for 750+ pages. I will leave with a stern warning. DO NOT give in to your curiousity. Leave well enough alone. Go buy anything by Michele West, Jacqueline Carey or George Martin. That would be money better spent."
1,Very Bad!,"I was extremely disappointed with this entire series. The first book was mediocre with a slight increase in the second and a complete let down with the final installment. To sum it up, having a root canal done at the dentist's office would be preferable than having to read this series again."
1,"Geez, this thing went on and on and on................","I was already tiring of this fantasy trilogy by the end of book two. Book two could have been pruned by at least 200 pages, and the entire 'trilogy' actually has a plot that's so slim it could have been edited into just one book of around 700 pages. But noooooo, both Hobb's and her publisher stretched as much out of it as possible, obviously so they could make more money.I read Hobbs' 'Liveship' Trilogy and loved it. The story was smart, fast-paced and involved, and set in a world that was full of detail but not overly explained. It was also full of interesting characters. In Assassin's Quest, the 'hero' (if that's what you MUST call him, because he's the biggest idiot ever to appear in fiction) is so incredibly dull and stupid that I just want to do King Regal's job and kill him myself.A huge disappointment. I think this will be the last book I read of Hobb's, as her ability to write believable and compelling fiction seems to be waning."
1,Was she tired of the Plot?,"After breathlessly waiting for the end of the best set of books that I had read in years, I felt I had been duped by how little thought and effort went into the ending. Was Ms. Hobb tired of the plot? Were there deadlines to meet? What possible explanation could there be for the abrupt way in which this story was laid to rest, or should I say shot in the back. I was so let down, that when her new book came out, I couldn't even bring myself to read the back of it."
2,Depressing and Slow,"I struggled with this book. I struggled to like it, I struggled in wading through chapter after chapter without momentum, endless events of Fitz getting hurt or meandering.I should have simply skipped 600 pages and read the last couple chapters sooner. The first fifty and last fifty pages are decent. The conclusion does wrap up the trilogy, but what you slog through in getting there is terrible. The 657 pages of the Middle needed an editor willing to cut sequences which added nothing to the story. Those 657 pages could be condensed into about 150 pages, and only then would this novel be wonderful.My recommendation is read the first three chapters, and read the last three chapters. You might like the book then; if you read the whole thing, you'll probably get sick of endless angst and Fitz being stupid, and keep putting it down. Like I did. It took me a month to finally finish with this book, due to boredom."
2,Did I actually pay to be depressed?,"Sorry, call me old-fashioned if needs be, but I tend to enjoy a book, or trilogy in this case, that has a GOOD ending. I cannot, in mere words, describe the utter disappointment this shoddy and ill-contrived ""final chapter"" engendered within me. I still frown whenever I think of this book; I felt, as a reader, cheated by the author. The plot went from adventurous to flat-out weird straight to contemptuous drivvle. The only reason I rated it two stars is due to the fact that the first two books were engaging. I stronly discourage anyone who doesn't fell like taking a mind-numbingly depressing jaunt through a literary catastrophe from reading this book."
3,Once you finally get there...,"This third and final installment to the Farseer Trilogy is a good book, but a long read. I do not think the entire story was slow, and I do enjoy the ""quest"" type story, but this book did drag in parts.The book dragged a bit in the beginning, but the second half was excellent. There were parts where I kept thinking 'Get to it already', but once you get there, it is well worth it. There were quite a few parts where I was thinking ""This book is amazing!"". So it is worth the read, especially if you want to finish out Fitz's story.Most of the loose ends are tied up, and it wasn't the ending I was expecting, and I won't say more than that. I thought the trilogy was a good story, and my favorite character was Nighteyes. I do believe I will continue to read Robin Hobb and pick up her other trilogy's."
4,Another great read from Robin Hobb,Another great read by Robin Hobb. I can't wait to continue Fitz's story in the Tawny Man series.
4,ANOTHER OF HOBB'S SUCCESSES,"I FOUND THAT THIS BOOKHAD A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH OF THE SAME SORT OF THINGABOUT IT, THAT IS WHY I LEFT THE RATING AT 4 INSTEAD OF 5.BUT ALL IN ALL A GOOD READ."
5,Bk 3 sustains the quality,"This 3rd book in the series is just as brilliant as the other 2. Hobb's story draws you in to a totally believable world of intrigues, politics and personal joys and triumphs. I felt that the main character Fitz was so finely drawn and his character was so cohesive, I began to feel I understand him and could even have a little weep at the bittersweet ending. His relationships are a highlight of the writing. This is fantasy so good that you forget it is a fantastical world and start to except the impossible talents people have and just go with the great story."
3,One of the best series ever comes to a hasty conclusion,"The first two books of the series Assassin's Apprentice and Royal Assassin were at the top of my list for recommended reading. Assassin's Quest carries this excellent work in the same direction until it hits a brick wall with a hasty and arttifical ending. All the wonderful plot and storylines are hashed together in an abrupt end that wraps it up with sickening suddenness. This story could have gone on easily to three or four more volumes without losing the essence and integrity of the plot. I still will recommend Hobb as a first rate author, but I was very disapointed with this last effort of her series"
4,Great except for the last drop,"Great series, but the ending seemed a bit to easy. I mean, the happy ending was rushed with one fell swoop! (literally)"
3,great series bad ending,THE ENTIRE SERIES WAS BRILLIANT WITH GREAT CHARACTER'S AND [I THOUGHT]A GREAT STORY LINE BUT THE ENDING IN MY VIEW WAS TERRIABLE AND WHILE I RECOMEND THAT YOU READ THIS SERIES JUST FOR THE GREAT WRITING EVEN THOUGH THE ENDING WILL DEFINATLY DISSAPIONT YOU.IT WAS I SAY AGAIN A DISSPIONTING FINISH AND A TWO YEAR OLD ILLITERATE CHILD COULD PROBALY FINISH IT PROPARLY.A DISSAPIONTMENT
4,This will be a classic,"In my mind, thanks to this series, Robin Hobb has established herself as possibly the best fantasy author actively writing today. (If Robert Jordan would ever conclude his series there might be some competition.) Her characterizations are unbelievably detailed and engrossing. I appreciate the concept presented in this series that great victories must often be achieved with great sacrifice. It is not often that author will spend as much time developing the physical and emotional states of the main characters as Robin does. I couldn't put the book down. I also didn't care that the hero doesn't necessarily live happily ever after at the end. In fact I found that rather refreshing. The only reason I don't give the book 5 stars is to reserve that score for when she writes something even better."
5,More Please!,I just finnished reading the series and am desperate for more. I hope Hobb continues the adventure. BTW is it Mr or Ms Hobb?
3,The Other Half,"I really enjoyed reading this. Although Darcy's friend, Kris, becomes the third victim of the strangler, we DO get to learn about the first two. I like how Hubert goes back and tells us about them after the third killing. I also enjoyed how she used both past and present to build the suspense. I am looking forward to reading more about Darcy, ""Watson"", and ""Sherlock"", seeing the relationships build and the mysteries unfold!"
3,Thought they came in a set of two,"The product is fine, I mean you know what they are when you buy 'em to go with your other closet hardware. My only issue is self made...didn't read the description, and thought that the rails would be sold in sets of 2. Nope. Individual. But that was my doing, so just ordered more."
3,Shipping condition awefull !!!!,"The sipping of the extension is a ripp off : a single tiny long piece of metal in a very large box that could contain 20 of those pieces... WHY ????? ????? The item itself is allright, the shipping condition is allwrong ..."
1,Wrong Items sent!!!!!,They took forever to ship my items then when I got them they were stainless steel cleaner rather than Rubbermaid connectors!!
4,Closet storage,"Love the Configurations line. Upright extension with connector is extremely easy to add on. Only disappointment is that when you order, it is per piece, not as a set of two as I would expect."
4,nice add on,This is an add on piece for the Rubbermaid Configurations closet set. This is by far the best set I've ever seen for a closet. I would highly recommend it.This piece is a necessity if you're going to get the configurations set as well. It allows you to not waste the bottom part of your closet like so many people tend to do without a closet system.I have this closet system in both of my closets and they're so efficient we got rid of our dressers and have a ton of space now both in the closets and the bed room.
4,Simple addition,"I had to extend my original rubbermaid deluxe system and these were recommended. It worked like a charm, I was able to add additional storage to the system very easily."
2,SO cute! But easily breaks exposing metal,"We had the same problem as the previous reviewer with the plastic things at the ends easily coming off, exposing the sharp ends of the framework. Also, the inside framework broke under what I considered to be very little pressure and the sharp metal stuck right through the protective plastic sleeves.My son LOVED his frog umbrella and we were very sad to have to throw it out, but it just wasn't safe anymore."
1,Horrible!,"My son has had 2 of the kidorable umbrella's and both have broken very quickly. The first ripped and exposed the spokes, which could be dangerous as they are sharp and can stick kids in the eye. He cried when the umbrella broke so I bought another. With this one, the entire pole came apart from the center of the umbrella while he was using it, resulting in the entire umbrella closing up with his head in it. Again, he was luckily not hurt. When I contacted Kidorable all I recieved was a vague apology and a suggestion to try and return the umbrella where I bought it. I am waiting to hear from Outdoor Kids, Inc. In the future I would never purchase Kidorable products."
1,No use and already faulty,"Got the ladybug umbrella. So cute. However one of the eyes of the ladybug at the top did not open. Faulty. When managed to fix it so that it sometimes opens, the plastic button that you push up and that keeps the umbrella open broke. A pity, the design is beautiful but I would not buy it. I was lucky I could get it changed in store since the store person was the one that trying to fix it actually finished breaking it."
5,Extremely Fast Shipment,"Book received much quicker than anticipated and in great condition, just as described. Recommend doing business with this seller! Thanks"
4,Excellent Game,The return of Ys. This game feels a lot like Zelda. It is a kind of cross between zelda and final fantasy. The only complaint I had with the game is that it was so short. You can beat it in about twenty hours. The battle system is pure hack and slash and it looks like the old nes game Wonders from Ys ( I think that was the name).It's good to see classic gameplay survive and it does in this game.
1,Not a good game,This game was very simplistic and focused to much on setting multiple difficulty levels. Overall it would be on the level of a handheld device vice a console game.
1,"Defective unit fried my comp, mediocre support","The wires on one of the four prong connectors on this weren't connected properly. When I connected my case fan the wires came completely loose, connected with the inside of the case and started to spark and burn. I don't have a new power supply to test with yet, but this power supply probably shorted out my brand new motherboard and/or my brand new hard drive.The best part is that I have to pay to ship back the defective unit.I don't expect them to pay for the hundreds of dollars in damages it probably has caused, but the least they can do is pay for the shipping to take their defective product back.I don't think I need to say I was very disapointed in the quality of this power supply."
5,More than I need,"Well built power supply with more than enough connections to last me for a long, long time. Extremely quiet. Easy to install."
5,Absolutely fabulous!!!!,"I just purchased this camera a couple of weeks ago, and I love it! I knew nothing of digital cameras. Nope, I'm still not an expert, but this camera is so easy to use! I do not recommend the docking station. However, I do recommend purchasing the travel pack. The bag is too big for carrying around town, but it is great for packing. It comes with the rechargable battery and a charger. I did buy the docking station, but the travel pack's battery and the ease of transferring directly from the camera to the computer just doesn't warrant the cost."
4,great little camera,love it. only one problem- the instructions don't say much about how to email pics. pics are good and clear.
4,"Great for taking shots, movie feature not so good.","As a digital camera, this camera is supurb.You'll like it, and you can find a cheap place to buy it if you look around. I bought this camera for $270.The movie feature that comes with this camera is not that great, the movies have horrible quality, but after all, if you want movies get a camcoder."
2,"Great Camera, but won't last long","I will have to say that when I bought this camera, it was great! Took awesome pictures, the rechargeable batteries were great, and with a Smart Card, I was able to take as many pictures as my heart desired. But two weeks ago, a year after I bought the camera, it would NOT turn on anymore. I didn't drop it, nor was it exposed to any water and it JUST quit on me, for no reason, which doesn't make sense. I tried to contact Kodak about it, but since it is not within the year warranty, they won't do anything unless I pay, even though I didn't do anything to the camera. It's still in new condition. So, after paying 300 dollars for the camera and dock, I'm out of a camera just because they failed to back their product. If you want to spend that much on a camera that will only last for a short while, just make sure you enjoy it because it won't last you long. So long Kodak."
1,DO NOT BUY DX4330,"Camera has performed well for 12 months. BUT...it keeps failing to turn on. Problem is intermittent and getting worse. Having searched the internet for people with similar problems, there are MANY. Kodak are aware that this is a problem but as is now out of warranty, they offer to fix it for $200. Might as well buy a new camera. Sure won't buy from Kodak again. Shame really as when working, it has performed very well.If anyone else has this problem, please share your experience on this web site so people can make an informed choice when spending their hard earned money.Thanks"
5,you would love this camera,"this camera is so easy to use, you don't need to go thru menu after menu, buttons after buttons. I also love the movie functions that i used a lot. the movie picture quality is so-so (sure, it's camera but for bloody sake) but movie picture does look pretty if you plug the camera on TV.Problems:the only problem i have with this camera is the battery life. I am surprised a couple folks said the battery life is not bad, but I think only the CRV battery coming with the camera lasts decent long enough, but other NiMH rechargables aren't last enough. so you may want to carry extra battery.Overall, I still highly recommend this camera with highest rating."
2,OVERALL UNHAPPY WITH PURCHASE,The camera worked just great for the first three weeks that I had it. I bought it because it was exactly what I had before (that one wore out). After three weeks the flash stopped working. I checked the manuel but didn't get anything useful. I won't take it to be repaired as it would probably cost me as much as buying a new one.
1,It stoped working,"The 4330 camera was wonderful when new,,but when it was 10 months old it started acting funny and when contacted kodak they recommended new batteries and holding the camera steady for correcting the sometimes blurry picts,,,the camera was purchased for a friend in June and her birthday was middle of July,,,a couple months ago it started acting up and lately it is hard to get to turn on and when you do it turns it's self off and then wont come back on for awhile,,,Kodak says if you send back for 200 dollars can fix it but like others on Amazon.com it will only start acting up in a few months again,,,After paying $300 dollars for a camera it sucks when it is not dependable nor backed by the manufacture,,would not buy another Kodak product if was only one on market"
2,AAIIEE AAIIEE AAIIEE,"Camera worked pretty good for 18 months. Had similar problems as everybody else ie lens cap popping off, big time redeye and my computer not being able to find the device. NOW it won't turn on and Kodak wants 200 of my finest Canadian dollars to repair it. It wasn't dropped-in fact I had used it 30 minutes previously, set it on the table, picked it up for a final shot and nada . They tried to get me to trade in for a CX7330 for 200 bucks but it won't be compatable with my dock. No wonder Kodak as a company is in trouble."
1,"good camera, terrible software","The camera is easy to use and the quality of the pictures is very good. Getting the pictures out of the camera and into your computer is another matter. The software is very un-intuitive, lots of ""albums"" and ""gallerys"" but all we wanted to do is get the photos into the PC. The ""Help"" file is not much help and Kodak's webpage essentially says to read the manual. Now I know why Kodak is going down the tubes."
5,I absolutely love it!,"This is a great camera. I bought this camera based on the megapixel vs price and it turns out it's everything and more. I'm a novice when it comes to digital cameras, this was my first one and kodak makes it so easy to work. I bought the kodak docking station as well which helps recharge batteries and load the pics onto your computer with a touch of a button. This is a great camera for the money and I would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a digital camera."
5,Very nice camera,"For every amateur photographer, this camera will prove to be a great investment.Pros:1. Consistently nice pictures with very good color saturation andsharpness.2. Very easy to use with good features (Macro, Portrait, Red-eye, Backlight, Video+Audio, 3X optical zoom, pretty ergonomic)Cons:1. [uses] batterys quickly. Need to get NiMH rechargable battries.2. Xfer speed is slow. Need to get an external card reader.3. Not-so-good transfer and picture handling software.Overall a very nice camera."
4,Great Toy for the little one's,My granddaughter age 18 months just loves it. You can hardly get her off of it. It is small enough to allow it in any room.
4,My daughter likes it.,"The assembly was fairly easy. My daughter enjoys the toy, she pushes it from behind and sometimes tries to climb on to the seat although she isn't quiet tall enought to so do yet."
4,Doll Walker,"This was quite difficult to get together - the holes were not aligned - well technically it still isn't finished, 2 of the screws holding the back push handle are still protruding a bit. My daughter loves riding, but still hasn't gotten the hang (or desire) of pushing - Oh well. It's the perfect size for a child around a year old - I was hesitant in getting a push/ride on toy without seeing it in person because I wanted her to be able to reach the floor while on it. She can but it's also big enough that I think that she will also enjoy it when she is bigger. Another selling feature to this push/ride toy was the lack of sound... so many baby toys are so loud, it's nice to have some that don't make noise. :) We make our own ""car"" noises."
4,OK but a little time to put together,"My daughter shows some interest in this rider but NONE of her dolls fit in the back spot that is made for dolls. She does have a friend who comes over and rides the thing all over the house, so I guess it does depend on the child. It is super sturdy, but I can't believe the original price according to amazon.com is $50.00 because I got it at Toys R Us for $12.00 on sale though. It is a decent ride on toy, but definately don't purchase it for a doll to ride on the back!"
4,"Basic, sturdy, and fun for two!","We requested this for a birthday gift for our 1 year old twins. They are #3&4 and we have had the bells and whistles type and just wanted something sturdy that they could both use that could take a beating (as our 4 & 2 year old would no doubt sneak a few rides). This absolutely fit the bill. One can ride while the other pushes. One of my twins started walking a little more than a week after getting this toy and I believe it helped a great deal.We have had ride ons with lights, bubbles, and sound in the past but those things just break and cause frustration. Sometimes simple is better. The only thing that I think may improve the fun factor a bit is a seat that lifts with storage underneath. That is one feature that my older kids loved in other things but, if it woud affect the sturdiness then it's not worth it.Simple, sturdy, and a good value!"
5,Little Tikes Push & Ride Doll Walker,Looked at several walkers before purchasing this one. It is thesturdiest of all the walkers. This is helping my granddaughter learnto walk and she loves riding on it. She even rides her puppy on itand they both love it.
4,Good toddler ride.,"We purchased the toy for our granddaughter's first birthday. She was just beginning to walk. By the time it arrived (weeks after order) she was walking. The scooter is easy for a small child to get on and off alone. She is able to push it with her feet. However, in the beginning she could only push backwards and rolled over her toe, so my advice is to wear shoes until they can push forward. Drawback: She has learned to stand on the seat with a 'look at me' attitude."
5,Great toy,I love this car! An immediate favorite of my 1 year old. I love how simple it is; it is a much- welcome reprieve from all my daughter's noisy electronic toys.
5,Granddaugther Loves This Walker,"I was looking for a walker for my youngest granddaughter and stumbled upon reviews for the Little Tikes Push and Ride Doll Walker. My daughter-in-law didn't want anything that would scratch the wooden floors, so I bought colored pink duck tape and cut it to fit around the wheels. That seems to have taken care of the potential for the plastic wheels to scratch. (I am sure others reading this review could think up other methods to cover the wheels.) As far as I can tell, that is the only drawback to this walker.It was not difficult to put this together, and everything seemed to line up well.My granddaughter was barely 11 months when she received this for Christmas, but she loved it right away. She is nearly 17 months now and still rides on it.It does MOVE across the floor, so a spotter is a wise idea until the child is walking well."
5,Little Tikes Push and Ride Doll Walker,My 2 year old daughter enjoys this walker. She can push and ride in the house as well as outside. The walker is very durable and she enjoys putting her dolls in the back slot. She tries to keep up with her older sister when she rides her scooter. Too cute.
5,You just can't kill this toy!!,"I got this toy from a friend of mine that already had 2 children drag it about, and now my daughter has used and abused it for over a year!! It just keeps on going! We had it in the house during the winter months, and she rode around on it. Now through spring, summer, and fall, she has driven it like a hot rod!! Like I said....you just can't kill this toy!!"
4,Sturdy and fun toy,"We bought this walker when my daughter was 10 months old and she loved it. Its very well designed and does not have any sharp edges or corners, which is a great for little ones learning to walk. Another thing that I liked about the walker is that it can be used indoors as well as outdoors."
5,As great as it looks!,"Needed 8 piece dinnerware to fit in one drawer of our camper--it stacked and fit beautifully, is lightweight and spiffy with camper's black and tan decor. We ate off it all weekend--nicely sized, including big bowls."
3,Colour tone of watch,"My only real comment one this watch is the fact that the picture of the watch on this site is very misleading. The picture shows a very pale gold tone, where in fact it is very yellow."
5,Comprehensive and concise-the first resource I reach for!,"This book is so comprehensive and concise that I habitually reach for it first when conducting research into the tedious and complex world of qualified retirement plan laws and regulations. Mr. Canan's text has consistently proven to be right on the money in its interpretations and is always accurate in citing primary legal sources. It is my gateway to efficient, accurate and complete legal research on retirement plans."
4,Great toy!,It is fun to image washing your own baby when you are five years old. It makes her feel like a real mommy with a real baby. She loves it!
1,Outrageous Price - $9 at Toys R Us,"I think this is a great toy, but it is ridiculous to pay the requested price. You can get this at Toys R Us for $9.00. Why on earth would I pay $25 for it??"
5,"HOT HOT HOT (and tasty, too!)","I bought this for my husband for his birthday this year, as he is a big fan of habaneros and was interested in trying out the ghost pepper. He ended up loving it, and declared it the best and hottest sauce he has ever had. Definitly follow the directions and do not overuse, as a little goes a very long way.Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper Private Reserve 2009 The First Seller To Bring You This Years Insane Reserve Sauce with the Guinness World Record Chile Pepper Bhut Jolokia"
4,Its Hot..,JUstt recieved this product about a week ago its great flavor but isn't the same as daves insanity sauce... the burn does not last near as long but its still good burn will last about 15-20 minutes... hope this helps
4,"Good book, nice margin notes","This version basically served all of my needs. For those who are reading this for a class, don't expect a Cliff-Notes, but then it doesn't leave you stranded either. The margin notes are contiguous from Chapter and Act to Chapter and Act, allowing you to read it from cover to cover or over the course of days and still have a clear understanding of the metaphors and other figurative language present in the play. The extra materials were also worth looking at. The beginning gives you a good jumping off point if this is your first dabble at Shakespeare, but has some information my teacher didn't even know about! The section at the end of the book is filled with teacher materials such as study notes, re-caps, guidlines and the like. NB: the margin translations are very specific and very helpful if you are not accustomed to reading the Bard's works."
2,Justice is not served,"Lady Macbeth scares me; she's crazy and it's all her fault. I hate how everyone hates and blames Macbeth, when it's really mostly Lady Macbeth's fault. She manipulates him throughout the play and yet she's the one who gets off easy, with everyone pitying her. Similar to ""Othello"" in that there's no justice to be found here."
5,Macbeth,"a tragic story of death and betrail. A great play to watch, read, and perform. Read this play!"
4,Good edition to act from,"These comments are primarily about the New Penguin Shakespeare's 'Macbeth', rather than the play proper. (Classic literature has enough folks on the case without me throwing in my two-cents-worth.)This is a good edition to act from. The book is cheap to buy, but well-made, with a good binding, print, and paper, AND the commentary is at the end, so the play's pages are clean and clear. The introduction is good, and somewhat witty. The Commentary is pretty good, too, but not as complete as I would have it. Everyone in the play should get a copy of this book, but the director will need more resources, I would think."
5,Simply saporous!!!,"The instructions are easy to follow, and the meals are fantastic. This book is truly going to help any celiac eat good."
2,"healthy yes, but difficult to live by","This book/plan most definitely provides a healthy eating livestyle, however I felt that it is not attainable by most mere mortals. I have fluctuated over the years as to my eating habits (going ""off the wagon"" and eating processed foods), and when I need to get back on track to healthy eating, this is the type of program that usually appeals to me. However, I find that it is too restrictive and I can't see remaining on it. Yes, you will be healthier and most likely thinner following this plan, but at what cost? Eating should be more pleasurable than this."
1,Bland and boring,"I found the dishes to be very bland and boring. You seem to eat much of the same style of food. There is not much variety, just like most of the other diets on the planet. I did not prepare a single dish that ended up looking like the pictures in the book. I highly recommend The Zone diet. The dishes were easier to prepare and much more delicious. I lost 7 pounds in 20 days on the five square program. However, I lost 18 pounds on The Zone Diet."
3,It's OK,"I saw this movie when it first came out many,many years ago and liked it. it still holds up. i especieally like the Cameo by James Mason."
3,Far Eastern is no Epic,"The sense of running, tension of escape, drama of conflicted characters is almost totally missing from this little desert story, though the filmmakers would certainly be disappointed to hear it from me. I had long wanted to see it and ordered the DVD which is technically of good quality. A surprisingly minor film in tone and execution, considering Yul Brynners epic stature at the time it was made, the film does deliver a very long and entertaining chase as Brynner and a surprisingly appealing Madelyn Rhue with Sal Mineo in tow break out and run for it, and run for it, and run for it. There is no big climax and Yul does not get to do his usual fine stuff; instead he is sort of hidden beneath a murky desert leader personage who is, untypically for Yul, a quiet type with little to say or do."
1,Cheap,"This stopped working a little over a month after it was bought. It is a cheap piece of garbage from China. Don't waste your money on this, but most of all, don't let your kid be disappointed like mine is. Also want to mention that I am probably out the money on it, as there is no way to return it. Thanks Amazon for another shoddy product."
4,Needs a little tweaking.,"This is a better PC than other Sony's I've reviewed, especially with regard to its value. The specs are good enough as shipped to make 95% of the PC market happy. The other 5% (myself included) would like to have a true gaming-capable machine, having 512 megs of system RAM, 64 megs of video RAM and USB 2.0-ready ports. All of this can be added, but of course that would add significantly (about 40% I reckon) to the price. In addition, there is no monitor included here, so that's another important expense, which along with the above-mentioned items would approximately double the asking price. Nonetheless, it's a quality machine with lots of great features and it's one I'd be happy to have for anything but interactive, Internet gaming."
5,A Must Find,"Although this book is currently out of print, I highly recommend searching for a used copy. These books are a true treasure and capture quilt making history and the individuals behind each quilt. I own this book and too many times to count, get it down to enjoy the beauty of the quilts, the stories behind the quilters, and to be inspired. I own Great American Quilts books from 1987 to 1993 and now own the various Great American Quilts books 1 to 8. Please read my reviews on the Great American Quilts books currently in stock. I think you, too, will want to have the full collection."
1,Teach Yourself Corel WordPerfect 8,"It seems this author wanted to fleece her buyers by taking money not well-deserved. The book is poorly illustrated. For instance, you hardly dind anything about Superscript and Subscript in the Index. There is no special section for the shift and ctrl buttons. If it were not dated, I would recommend someone beginning with WordPerfect to consult Alan R. Neibauer's ""WordPerfect: Tips and Tricks."" This book is a wasteland as for teaching a novice at WordPerfect."
5,Excellent video!,I really enjoyed this new perspective look into factual based cases of alien abduction. The arficats Dr. Leir has come across are simply amazing......
1,Wrong pads somehow.,"Well I ordered these about 3 weeks ago & they arrived very fast in the mail. No problem there. I finally got around to taking my rear tires & rims off yesterday so I could install my new brake pads & lo & frigging behold, they're too small for my car. Now I ordered the correct brakes for my rear but these when compared to the brakes already on my car, well they're alot smaller. The brakes I ordered had the slot underneath that said whether or not they fit my car, and it said they do. But the brakes fit a car more like a Cobalt or something. I'm very disappointed because now I have to sell these at a loss & I have to find another pair of rear brakes."
1,Four for movie - zero for DVD-R...,"Very good film. Dressler is always great. If you haven't seen it, rent it or look for it on TCM. Don't waste your money buying this DVD-R from Amazon. They list format as DVD but 'fine' print will tell you it's actually a DVD-R.I recorded it and put on DVD-R myself (for my personal collection). Created my own cover art and DVD art. Cost about four bucks and as good as Amazon's. I've made over 1500 of these (no - I don't sell them) over the years for about four grand. Would have been about thirty grand online.Please protest to Amazon about this misleading practice."
4,clear solutions large maple recipe box,"Liked the box, just too big for my needs. About half the size would have worked for me. I should have gotten out the ruler and checked the measurments! Nice box though!"
5,Very flexible and attractive,I ordered this for my sister-in-law and she really liked it. It's so flexible (taking either 4x6 or 3x5 cards) and it's attractive.
1,Not reliable,"We have used this product for just over 1 year in our church. Two of the inputs are dead. The effects section is dead. The EQ is not behaving properly (for example, when setting the selection switch so that one set of EQs is for the monitor and the other is for main, only the right speaker comes on, so we are forced to configure the EQs as left/right). The feature set is nice for the price, but not if everything starts failing right after the 1 year warranty is up."
4,A disturbing account of the fragility of democracy,"Mazower gives a chilling account of how during this last century in Europe democracy has until only recently been accepted by most states. The popularity of ideas e.g. fascism and communism should not be overlooked despite the received wisdom today that such systems were evil. This account of European history this century is by no means comprehensive. Nevertheless, it does reflect on some of the more unsavoury issues that are conveniently forgotten by today's, and even more so yesterday's, writers of legends. Mazower provides the reader with a historical perspective that has the barbed-wire attached. His book is in no way revisionist it simply shows Europe in all its glory and disgrace. A very stimulating and thought-provoking account."
2,Detailed but half-baked,"Mazower's book is impressively far-ranging and synthetic, but he fails to interrogate his conclusions fully. Many of his conclusions are contradictory, and he applies a rather fluid standard of judgment. For example, he concludes a long and excellent discussion of how the Treaty of Versailles gave birth to the divise nationalism that continues to plague Europe with an account of Hitler's ideology that describes his use of a wholly new and incomparably virulent nationalism. Both discussions are plausible, but together they are muddled and incompatible. In sum, individual sections of this book are fine and insightful, but the work as a whole is incoherent."
5,"I revewed Fisher price makover Angelica,junior docter outfit,sweet streets hopital,and more","When me and Angelica were at the hosital just after are son was born,they used this tub to clean him.it did an excellent job and kept him warm and clean during his bath.They made him smell nice and kept him happy with teh rubber duck.after,they dried him off with the towel.Angelica was handed him and he smelled so nice.i hihgly recomend this to hospitals for bathing fisher Price Angelica sons."
5,Dream Theater Awake Guitar tab book,"It's a good book but there are some mistakes in the tabs to the brigde to Erotomania, the notation is good. The songs have a good setup and the whole thing is worth five stars!!"
5,A book with many answers,I found the book well-written. I read it and pass it onto someone else to read because I felt it was an exceptional book.
5,Must have,"This is a great book and a must read for those who really want to know the answers to the ""Why"" questions of God."
5,Real help in heartwrenching times,"Ann's short book is a breath of fresh air for those who: have experienced heartache, are experiencing heartache, or certainly will experience heartache in the future. Often life is brutal, but having Christ's perspective of suffering is foundational to help us continue.Ann gives no easy answers, but tells us of Help beyond human understanding in a poignant, understandable way. Those of us who are older, as well as those much younger, can find real help here."
4,"Perfect ""Mom"" tool","I was looking for something I could always have with me for those times when the kids would ask me to open something or pull out a splinter, etc. This fits the bill! I love it. I always carry it with me since it's on my keychain, and have used it several times since I bought it a few months ago. (I removed a wood chip from my daughter's croc, pulled out a bee stinger from my son's hand, and cut open an otter pop at my daughter's soccer game.) Now my kids ask me, ""Can you use your tool for this?"" The only weaknesses would be that the tweezers aren't very strong and I wish it had a toothpick. Overall, very happy with purchase. I think all moms should have one!"
3,Spotty Quality,"The Squirt S4 has exactly the features that I want in a very small pocket tool: knife, screwdrivers, tweezers, and some scissors that are large enough to be useful. However, I had to exchange my Squirt TWICE before I finally got one that was good quality. The first one had issues with getting the small screwdriver to fold back in. The second one had a bent knife and the scissors didn't cut well. The third is a keeper, except that the aluminum sides tend to get worn fairly quickly."
5,Super Useful Tool for your Keychain,"I love the squirt. Perfect size versus functionality. The scissors and sharp knife are most useful. I always carry it around and for many years have found uses for it multiple times a week from simple little things to ""oh, I can use my leatherman for that"" kind of things. Top quality, I love it."
5,"""Hippies"" Will Bring Back Memories","I truly enjoyed ""Hippies""! I saw myself in this book as the character, Dave Early - the neat,tidy, everything in its place sort of guy. Each reader should be able to find themselves as one of the characters going through college life in this interesting book. Hopefully, history will never repeat itself in the demonstrations that took place and the shooting of anti-Vietnam War protestors on the Kent State campus in 1970."
2,Take a spelling class,"While reading this book, I was constantly annoyed by the countless grammatical and spelling errors found throughout the story. Did Mr. Jedick not proof-read this before sending it to the publisher? I noticed in another review that he graduated with honors but does not know when to use the proper forms of ""to"" or ""too"". He also made a reference to ""Brett"" Butler and Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind. Hello, everyone knows it's ""Rhett""! The book is poignant and entertaining and gives first-hand insight into this very wild decade. I did not dislike it but found it rather trite."
4,Useful with Great Organization,"This is a great study guide particularly because of1. The extensive and insightful content2. The structured and accessible organization of the material/information3. Her ability to concretize the data with multiple, practical examples.It's an expensive book though and it will be wise to flip through the book or borrow it from a library (hard copy); download a sample or even rent it for a day or two (with e-readers) before moving forward with purchase. However, if you're interested in understanding and improving your communication skills, it's a handbook worth looking into."
1,not what you want,"i wanted to order auto brakes technology, when i clicked on order it i was sent this book. this is the workbook, not the supported text"
3,A little bit disappointed,"At the beginning is an interesting book, but in the middle of it it goes out of the story so many times that is a little boring, and at the end, when Colin talk to Leyla you will know everything he is going to say to her (because Leyla deducted before) and Leyla get impressed at the conversation.Many things of the book are taken out of the hand (I can't write them right here because I will tell you the end of the story) so the story gets a good end.On the other hand, the story is a good one because all the members of the family, except one, want her own good by keeping a secret that will hurt Leyla, at least is what they think.I put three stars to the book because is not what I expected of Barbara, but I recommend to read it you will have a good time."
3,"Good story Development, but...","I liked this book a lot, read it very fast, I found the whole English Gothic feel very appealing, and the horror atmosphere, even thou when it isn't a horror novella per se, the characters development stalls at times, but the main character Leyla is well developed (clearly as the author's a woman), I enjoyed it through and through but was very disappointed by the ending, I always find it appalling when a good book ends in a couple of poorly written paragraphs is always a signal of an authors lack of talent/interest in wrapping a story. Just for that I wont be rating this book higher."
3,Re WeatherTech,"This deflectors has an excellent quality, but poor functionality, they are not preventing wind.The reason I bought them is to prevent cross-wind flow in the salon and reduce outer noise.Even after I installed all four deflectors I didn't achieve any result."
5,"Clinical Epidemiology, the architecture of clinical research","The late Alvan Feinstein's magnum opus on clinical epidemiology is a wonderful book for the clinical researcher. It is not for the faint hearted or the tyro, it is filled with thought provoking ideas and Feinsteinism that make the book interesting to read. Although I should use the term ""read"" loosely for this book is not really one to read. Feinstein does not fail in dissecting nearly every area of epidemiology and provides cogent thought with great detail. Feinstein has been helping students learn epidemiology well before the folks at McMaster University made epidemiology a household word in health care. The beginning chapter on the different forms of ""bias"" is the best I have ever read."
4,Lazer for chop saw,Got it. Installed in minutes. Worked correct right away. Only negative is the LED's are a bit dim and can not be seen when working outdoors unless you have shade.Bob
5,A practical addition,"Economical and practical. If you haven't used laser guides on cutting tools before, this is a great place to start."
1,Review of Northern Tool Laser Cutting Guide,I did significant research including reading all the information on this laser guide but when it arrived it did not fit my Craftsman circular saw. Now I am stuck with a $20 guide I have no use for or way to sell. I wish manufacturers would do a better job of telling you exactly what works and doesn't work.
2,Not the Best Choice,"I bought this book because it is attractive, but it has one flaw so annoying that I am currently shopping for something to replace it. The flaw is that the area designated for paint chips is both bigger than the size of an average paint chip and a vivid aqua. I like aqua, but the aqua border that shows around whatever paint chip you add changes your perception of the color (and, depending upon the color, can be incredibly ugly). This problem is a deal breaker for me, as I buy these things to keep track of interior design decisions, and you can't hold the book against fabric, etc. to gauge color matches. The rest of the book is nice looking, but I'd trade the design features for utility."
5,Great Gift,"As a realtor, I give my clients this book upon closing of their new home. It is perfect for them to keep track of their home improvement vendors, bills, color choices, etc... One place to keep their home improvement files in."
4,Great place to keep all the information that you need.,I can't really review this at this time because it was a gift. Ask me again in a year.Homeowner's record keeper appears to be perfect for the gift recipient.
5,Great 90s coming of age book,I absolutely loved this book. It's been many years since I read a book in a 24 hour span like I did with this one. How well I remember the younger days of seeming invincibility and the endless search for a thrill bigger than the last one. Mr. Baldwin has captured all of that (and more) perfectly herein.
4,A Literate Thriller,"I was thoroughly impressed with Frank Baldwin's first novel ""Balling the Jack"". Mr. Baldwin (that sounds funny) speaks to me and my generation like Douglas Coupland and few other authors do. His dialog is perfect and the story compelled me to ignore my wife for two days during my last vacation.I was actually surprised with the ending. Frank Baldwin is obviously familiar with contemporary literature and I expected the ""great American novel"" tragic ending ala ""The Natural"" or ""Less Than Zero"". But unlike ""The Natural"", Hollywood won't feel any need to change things when it comes to the big-screen. I guess that's a good thing.Besides, any novel that makes mention of The Pogues, The Clash, and Husker Du in the span of a few dozen pages deserves to be read by anyone from my generation."
5,Baldwin is a master of the all-around male hero,"This is the best novle I ever read. It's not a master literary work like Catcher In The Rye, but Baldwin creates the greatest protagonist of all in Tom Reasons, who most men can identify with. His wild ways seduce us, while the sensitive side of him creates very extraordinary scenes with his ex, Lisa. The theme of loyalty is everywhere, and is reminiscent of many moments in every guys life. The darts, the baseball, the chasing of the lost love and the camradarie of the six buddies gives the reader a wonderful experience in how we wish we were."
5,"quick, easy read",I really liked this book- very quick and easy to read. My heart was pumping during the last baseball game bet- and I thought he did a great job of developing the characters.
2,infuser ruins it,"I got this because it has an infuser and I could make tea and drink it all day.Unfortunately the infuser is too small to allow tea leaves to expand, it's a piece of garbage plastic, and the holes are too big allowing tea leaves to escape.After the first pot of tea using the built in infuser I had 2 issues.1. tea tasted like plastic2. i couldn't take the tea leaves out of the infuser since it's so small and narrow.I'll have to use a different infuser. Hopefully the plastic taste is only from the infuser and I can use it as a regular pot.EDIT (Dec 2009):I was reading other reviews and someone recommended these bags to use (100 Finum Tea Filter, Large, Brown). I think this is the only way to use this carafe. I don't want it to be a waste of money... On the positive side, the carafe works ok and tea made with the paper tea bags tasted alright. So it's not a complete waste. It held tea warm for a long period and I like how the base is wide so it's tough to knock over."
2,Another Unnecessary Collection,"Only 9 tracks. Only 31 minutes of music. This CD does not match longtime fans' demand neither is a representive hit collection which would honor Mathis career. Browse back and buy the CDs ""Heavenly"", ""Johnny"", ""Johnny's Greatest Hits"". Forget this one."
4,Johnny Mathis could sing the phonebook!!!,"My wife and I love this CD. The only reason we did not give it five stars is because as noted, there are not enough tracks on it! Johnny does a truly excellent version of The Look of Love and This Guy's in Love with You. And never miss his immortal version of Misty! Great sampler of Johnny Mathis at a good price!"
4,Value for Money,"Its an excellent value for money. Excellent performance, good memory both storage and runtime. Its has got all one needs for personal use . I think its a good buy"
3,Amazing! BUT....,"This is the best light I have ever owned. It is easy to turn on and if you get the correct lights, it will support your live plants.The only problem is that the protector was hard to come off and CHIPPED. I had to remove it to install lights. OH, that reminds me, for all of you looking for good lights, IT DOES NOT INCLUDE LIGHTS! But I knew that before. It does need to make that clear though.ONE THING I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH.You would think with an original price of over $200 and a buying price of over $100, you would think it cam with A LONGER CORD. This thin is like 3 feet long >:(If I am paying this much money, I WANT A LONGER CORD!ALSO, that is just the product itself. The seller was a OK person to work with :35 stars for the seller!"
2,Hopefully you will be one of the lucky one's!,"When I received this item their were parts missing, and the plastic that cover's the bulbs also had a crack in it. As another person stated, this was pathetic packaging and you would think someone would check item before shipping!The hood will serve its purpose but is very cheaply made. I'm sure their are much better choices for 105 bucks!"
2,Missing parts and a crack in the glass,"Just to start off, I didn't actually get to use the item so that's why I gave the product two stars. When I looked in the box the brackets were missing so I couldn't attach it to my aquarium. It did come with a cable to hang from the ceiling but I wasn't planning on doing that. Also, there was a crack on the protective glass, so I shipped the hood back."
2,It's just OK,First one I received was defective and had to return. The electrical cord is too short. Larger than my last and kind of bulky. The best feature on this light is each blub has it's own on/off switch.
3,for advanced level classes,"This is a great book. However if you want to get the most out of it1. You need to already know corporate finance- intermediate to advanced level.2. This book has only cases. Only if they are discussed in a classroom setting, you would be able to learn something.The extent to which you would learn would depend upon how well the Professor conducts the discussion in the class. I had a great Prof. for this class so I really applied whatever I learn over 3 semesters of finance."
1,"WARNING-These are only cases, almost NO content","I bought this book to read outside of a class hoping to read through some really good case studies in finance, and hopefully apply several semesters worth of finance classes to some real world examples. However after receiving the book I realized that these were only cases, not case studies, meant to be discussed in a class. There is almost no content, and college professors would actually be better off building their own cases from current business publications."
5,"Excellent, made the subject practical","The book was excelleant, but I never knew if the answers I provided were correct, is there no model answers on the case studies that one could check one's answers against. I am a final year MBA student in South Africa with no real previous Finance experience and this book really assisted me in gaining a practical understanding. Please let me know about model answers"
3,Respectable Opinion,"Toward the Livable City contains short stories and narratives by journalists, planners, and writers describing their experiences in their favorite cities - explaining both simple and subtle details that make each place great. Not the best book on planning, but does describe some qualitative aspects outlined by different writings (such as Portland, Cambridge Mass., etc)."
1,A Rush greatest hits album? What the f*@k??,"It's amazing that these guys have lasted long enough for a greatest hits album. Geddy Lee, like much of prog rock, is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Worse, they're from Canada. Cool people will stay away from this disc."
1,This is a cheap imatation of Yes and Led Zeppelin,Second rate progressive sissies.Buy a Bowie Albulm!!!1
5,Rush,If you like RUSH this is a no brainer. Sorry I don't like one direction obviously they don't know what a wrestling mat is !!!.
3,Not a good compilation...,"In my opinion, only 5 songs from the first 5 RUSH albuns are not a good compilation...I know they have to go through many albuns, but if you are starting to listen to RUSH this will not give any parameter of the RUSH geniality!!!!Where's ANTHEM, FINDING MY WAY, LA VILLA STRANGIATTO???the long epics???OH, MY GOD...NO SONGS FROM CARESS OF STEEL!!!!Sorry, it's reeeeally bad...THE BEST YEARS FROM RUSH are the first 6 till the classic PERMANENT WAVES...in fact, you should buy These albuns instead of this greatest hits..."
4,A great compilation,This is a great single CD compilation for people who want the cream of the crop. My minor complaint (as with other reviewers) is that the song Bastille day is not included on this disc. The hits are all here. Buy it now Rush Fans.
3,Was this cd necessary?,"Great! Yet another ""compilation"" of the same songs from Chronicles and the Retrospective cds. I guess this is a ""best of"" the previous ""best of's"". There really is no reason to buy this cd if you already have Chronicles or Retrospective. Wait a minute...There's a bonus dvd in there. And it has...5 songs from the Chronicles dvd! Horray! Being a die-hard Rush fan, I just don't understand why this is being released. The dvd should have at least had some of the videos that came out after Chronicles. The only reason anybody should buy this cd is if you don't already own Chronicles or Retrospective. If you've never heard Rush before and you're curious, then yes, this cd would be the perfect one. In that aspect, I give it 5 stars. It has all their hits."
5,Rush,"RUSH has an amazing, unique sound, which I thoroughly enjoy and the overall quality of the CD is way above exceptional."
4,A good single disc collection.,"The people who won't like this collection will be the ""Rush"" fanatics, everyone else should love it. I was going to get the 2 disc ""Chronicles"" set, which I'm sure is great, but opted for this instead. Why? Because the songs I wouldn't be getting from ""Chronicles"", I didn't know anyway, this is remastered, a single disc, and it's half the price. 16 remastered ""Rush"" classics on one convienient cd. Plus I got the limited-edition bonus DVD, which is basically 5 videos and song lyrics. I know there's more complete CD and DVD collections out there, but for the casual fan like me, this is perfect."
1,No Reason......,"... I'm guessing Geddy, Alex, and Neil owed the record company some type of release within this alloted time span but why this? As previously mentioned, these tracks are all available via other compilations and any ardent Rush fan already has all of the albums anyway. The tracks are all great and the dvd is nice but this is just a hastily thrown together collection of tracks purely for the money. Rush could have easily released a live album from their vast collection of back archives which I would have bought in a second. How about the '76 2112 tour or better yet 1978-80's Hemispheres/Permanent Waves era. I guess like all other bands (with rare exception) Rush has become a slave to the record industry... Recommended to bandwagon Rush ""fans"" only."
1,Another Rush greatest hits compilation? Give me a break.,"When will this madness stop? I mean, don't we already have Chronicles and the two Retrospectives? And to top it all off, all the songs on this compilation can be found on the 2 CD/cassette Rush compliation, Chronicles. Also, all the videos on the bonus DVD can be found on the Chronicles DVD. So save your money and buy the 2 CD/cassette compilation, Chronicles, and the Chronicles DVD. Universal should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this, as it's just another way to keep making money off a band that's no longer with them."
1,Not another greatest hits!?,"How many times can we buy a cd with the same songs? Obviously Rush is going to find out if three times is the charm. I think their last effort ""Vapor Trails"" was definitely lacking as well. They should focus on writing quality studio tracks instead of issuing greatest hits.I own every Rush cd but Vapor Trails, and refuse to buy this one. I may love Rush but I'm not spending my money on re-issues."
1,How can you listen to Rush at a time like this?,"You could die at any moment...Do you wanna go out with Rush in between your blood and brain barrier?You are what you eat.Who knows where you go when you die. What if Rush is the thing at the end that last forever...I don't think even Rush fans want that.You are selfish.You do not want to admit that you are wrong, so you listen to Rush over and over again...Go out and volunteer and not listen to Rush for like 2 seconds..."
1,proper product description,"Can't you xxxxxxxs write a proper product description? Tracks on cd - for each: at least length of track, date recorded, studio/live. How the xxxx can I decide whether to buy w/o this info?"
3,Nice collection of old standards but still missing some cuts,"Once again we have another rush greatest hits collection. The third in the past six years to boot. Many other singles are omitted here: ""Lock & Key"", ""Prime Mover,"" ""Afterimage"", ""The Enemy Within"", ""The Body Electric,"" ""Circumstances,"" ""A Farewell To Kings"" just to name a few.Why doesn't Mercury release a live collection to compliment this CD, sampling tracks from Exit Stage Left, All World's A Stage, and A Show of Hands?? Rush's studio output is very impressive but I was always more interested in them as a live band. It would not be too difficult assembling songs from these tours as I'm sure there are several soundboard shows in the vault that could be easily cleaned up for official release."
4,"another retrospective chronicle of Rush's greatest ""hits""","With the exception of the Rolling Stones and Aerosmith, I have never seen such a shamelessly repetitive releases of compilations. That said, if you want just ONE cd that covers the Rush greatest hits, this is the ONE. If you want a bit more thorough coverage, then 'Chronicles' is for you - 'Retrospective' CDs do not have nearly as good a song choice."
3,"Well,",If you have NO rush- then this is a good start- otherwise- Im sure you have all of these tracks.
3,Good for the casual fan.,"This is a good collection for the casual fan or has peaked the interest of a newbie.It's very tough to take so many good songs from a band and cram it into one disc, and try and please a fan. This is one of those cases.The reason why I gave it a three, is just cause I'm a fan, and would have liked to have seen Distant Early Warning and Force Ten removed. The Body Electric and Lock and Key, would have been better.Also Limited Edition could mean 1 million made - whatever still left. So I wouldn't bank on this being that big of a deal.This is good for my car."
3,It's good if you don't already have lots of Rush CD's.,"Also, I didn't read the fine print. I purchased the limited edition with the hope of seeing some new videos on DVD. The included DVD is just the same one called ""Chronicles""I have no idea why this CD/DVD is being sold. If you purchase it, look carefully at the selection of songs as it's the same stuff we all had before. The repackaging smacks of a marketing ploy to sell product. Maybe they need some retirement money?I'm a little disappointed. I would have liked to see a live album of their last tour."
5,A comprehensive compilation,"It has all the songs I was looking for. If you are a fan of Rush, this is actually a no brainer."
4,Can't blame the group!,"Yes, we all know that there's been too many Rush compilations, and that the first one (Chronicles) had the best selection at the best value. But this is what major labels do... no surprises! In fact, I think it's about time for Atlantic to put out a compilation of the stuff Rush has done since Presto, but there might not be sufficient 'commercial demand'.Anyways, the songs that are here are great. Judged on their own merits, they make up a great compilation disc that is worth every cent. And in terms of repackagings, Rush certainly hasn't had their catalogue exploited to the same extent that the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, the Who, or Kiss have, among MANY others."
1,Kindle version only,"From reading the other comments the book sounds great, so I downloaded the free sample. It's obvious that the publisher just ran the printed book file through a conversion program to create the Kindle version and no one looked at the output. It's riddled with blatant errors. It's a shame when a version of a good book is ruined by the incompetence of the publisher."
5,Lombardo's Odyssey A Winning Journey,A must for every bookshelf. The author's introductory remarks are exceptional in they efficiently and effectively set the context of Homer's work and thus prepare the reader for a very satisfying literary experience.
3,Almost all I wanted,"I purchased this book while reading ""M - the Man Who Became Caravaggio"". ""M"" has almost no pictures and I was looking for a good source of his works. There is no index of works in this books, so I spent a lot of time thumbing back and forth trying to find paintings. Also, a few of the works discussed in ""M"" don't appear here. I enjoyed the format in which the paintings are presented, except for a couple of instances where a detail of a painting was shown, but not the whole painting."
3,Too much on other artists,"The layout of the book is superior; where it falls short is that it mentions too many other painters. I would have preferred that all of the plates were Carvaggio's. I understand wanting to put them in context, but I would have preferred less emphasis in other places."
1,"Frustrating chair, not worth the $ and arms wiggle. Never solid.","First the arms wiggle too much. The arm rest are never in one place. Either gliding or sliding around. They move too much. This is one junk ""feature"" they can do without.For the price, of $845 it was too expensive for this item.I tried to contact Steelcase about this. Never got a proper reply. They sent an email asking me to contact them . and then after I tried to call, never actually could talk to a customer service rep, so you are on your own, if you buy and have any problems. Customer service is not high on their agenda.Overall this chair is ok. Not worth $845. Maybe $250."
2,Good Chair. Not great - especially considering the price,"The chair is pretty good and very adjustable. However has a few annoying flaws - which is rather unfortunate given the price.First the arms wiggle a lot. They move too much. This is one junk ""feature"" they can do without.The fabric of the chair is not very breathable also. It does get a bit warm.Most importantly the seat is never completely fixed. It moves a little forward or backward. That is supposed to be a feature when leaning backward. But in the seated position, it becomes extremely annoying when just a little movement causes the seat to slide a little bit forward or backward.I tried to contact Steelcase about this. Never got a proper reply. They sent an email asking me to contact them .. But upon calling was redirected a few times and decided it was not worth the hassle. Probably customer service is not high on their agenda.Overall this chair is ok. Not worth $800. Maybe $250 is more like it."
1,One of the worst chairs I've ever sat in,"I've had this chair at work for about 3 years now. I'm a computer programmer and sit in this chair for almost the entire 8.5 hours that I am at work. I have tried to get the difficult adjustments right and I have played around with them a lot and, no matter what I do, I can't get it to a position that's comfortable. Depending on the day, sometimes it ranges from noticeably uncomfortable to downright painful. The maximum tilt back position is a joke. I feel like I'm sitting straight up as opposed to being tilted forward otherwise. Reclining is just not possible in this chair, so even if it weren't uncomfortable, it would not be appropriate for home use. The left and right movement of the arms is incredibly annoying as they just move wherever with very little pressure. The lumbar support is a pain to get adjusted. I am 5'11"" and around 175Lbs for the record."
4,This is Beyond Weird,"I love Primus, I own Punchbowl, Pork Soda, Seas of Cheese and The Brown Album. Not to mention Hallacino-Genetics and Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People. They are my second favorite band alive. This CD is among Claypool's oddest work so far. I think it's the keyboards, just hearing Bernie Worrell with Les Claypool puts this over the top of Primus/related projects as far as being differant. Yet this album is somehow addictive. You will either love or hate this album. Sample the songs for yourself before making a purchase."
2,Disappointing,"I have been kind of out of the loop with Mr. Claypool lately (my main interest in this band, although I am interested in learning more about Buckethead). This is my assessment: there are two types of people--those who will love this album and think it genius and those who will be taken aback by the musicianship-over-song approach found on this album. Sure, there is unbelievable playing to be found here. But those of us who are drawn in by the lure of more output from Mr. Primus will find this to be no Brown Album, no Punchbowl, not even Antipop. Why? Because the focus is on technique and jam rather than driving, insanity-fuled bass/thrash manifesto SONGS. That is not to say it is a bad album, you just must know what you are getting into and what your tastes are. If you like jam bands, you are likely to have a delightful seizure with this album. If you like classic Primus, you should buy one of their albums instead."
5,the game second season,i love this show.. it was the only show that has all black cast that was still good... other than other shows like 90's where most of good black sitcoms where all of anything bt the greatest... i love it (moesha 1996-2001) and the fresh prince of bel-air (1990-1996) and its mom and dad tv show (girlfriends 2000-2008) this is a must own tv dvd must have if your into black shows with good acting and story lines other than moesha fresh prince and girlfriens... season 4 will air in 2011 on bet.. after the cw stop the show back in may of 2009.
5,Heart-breaking and unforgettable,"I read this book when it was first published, when I was in my early teens, and I've never forgotten it. I'm happy that it's back in print.An earlier poster summarized the plot pretty well, so I won't rehash it. It's not a book for those who want bodice-ripping, swash-buckling ""historical"" fiction. As in all her books, Holland achieves her effects quietly and with economy, conveying passion without sentimentality and fleshing out her well-researched historical knowledge with rare sympathy and insight into human nature. Her books, including this one, seldom have happy endings, so those looking for a feel-good read should go elsewhere. Those who want a challenging and thought-provoking trip to the past need seek no further."
5,Works Great,I bought the mount to hang a LED TV in my motorhome and this mount worked great. It doesn't move left or right it just stays put which is what I needed.
3,Changed Ingredients,"My dog has severe food allergies and this is one of the very few canned foods she is able to eat. With it's limited ingredients, I can confidently feed it to her knowing she won't have a medical reaction. When the local pet/grocery store stopped carrying this product, I was grateful to find it on Amazon.***UPDATE*** 2/28/2013The ingredients in this canned food has been changed to include Pea Flour, to which my dog is highly allergic. It is very disappointing to eliminate yet another brand of food from the ever decreasing, limited choices that my shepherd can tolerate. I don't know why the company decided to change the formula. It is no longer a ""great"" product for me."
5,Mindblowing,"I have heard Stewart talk on a lot of radio shows before I even knew he was a part of Montauk. He is one of the most fascinating persons I've ever heard from. His breath of experiences is mindblowing. Montauk was real and this book is another data point to show it's existence lingers on. The book is a quick read too, easy to get through and hard to put down. For those looking for the bounds of existence in this world own it to themselves to absorb this one."
2,Mediocre fantasy,"As gullible as I am, even I was hard put to digest the wild tale put before my eyes. After much internet research, I decided to buy this book, along with ""Montauk, The Alien Connection."" I read the latter first, and thought myself on some great track to solving a conspiracy mystery. I guess you could say that Swerdlow's story kind of woke me up and caused me to realize what bunk all of this alien crap is. If there really are agents of misinformation perpetuated by the New World Order to confuse us and make us not believe, I don't think they could have done a better job than Swerdlow at making a person riding the fence of mainstream science and the paranormal jump quickly back over the mainstream side. If it is raining some Saturday, and you want some good mindless entertainment to amuse you for a few hours, plunk down some bucks and check this book out."
2,Omega repair service is not helpful,"After four months I had the Omega Juicer, the central piece on the top of the motor base housing broke down. I couldn't open the nut anymore. I sent the machine for repair to the Omega. It took three weeks to get it back. When it arrived back, the handles on the side were damaged, most probably because of not enough packing material around it. The company offered me to replace the handles a different color though).I got the handles and after two days I used the machine the same exact problem happened.When I called back the Omega repair service, they said that I could send it back for repair again each time my shipping cost was $20), they said it was my fault because I didn't tighten the nut strongly enough. At that point I was wondering why they didn't tell me before. In the instruction booklet they write not to over tighten the nut.I took the machine and trash it."
1,Bad Product,"I've owned three Omega Juicers. Certain models have very flimsy side clamps which break after a year or so. Once the clamps break you're in big trouble. You can purchase a replacement part, after a few tries the company may even send the correct part, for a fee of course. Avoid this juicer. Avoid this company. Needless to say I will not be buying another product from them."
2,"Bulky, hard to clean...","This product while very sturdy, is otherwise hard to recommend. The unit is very difficult to clean, given that it takes so many vegetables or oranges, etc. to make it worth the time and energy to enjoy the results. It is on the ""I wish I hadn't bought it..who can I give it to..."" category of un-used appliances. Also the sender of this Amazon purchased item sent it quite casually wrapped..that's why I could praise its sturdiness!"
1,Don't buy this.,"The little blade is strong, but the little plastic knob that holds the blade in place loosens and comes out when you are juicing. I know because it came out and shredded into my fresh lemon juice!"
1,Bought machine in September and it stopped working in December.,"I am deeply disappointed with the quality of this product. I bought the juicer in September of 2012, and by December it stopped working completely. I also opted for splurging on a more expensive juicer precisely because I was hoping it would translate into a more durable machine. Alas, it was money down the drain.It's also very frustrating that I have no recourse with Amazon.com in terms of getting my money back because I was given only 1 month in which to return it for a replacement. You would hardly expect a machine to last only 1 month. But there you go, it lasted all of three months."
2,disappointed,"It took a total of one apple (cut into 8 slices so as to fit in the small chute) and an equal quantity of grapes to derail this juicer. Upon my first use, I made an entirely yummy 8 oz glass of apple-grape juice without any trouble. I then switched the juicer to off and handed out a few dixie-cups-of-deliciousness to family members. Still quite thirsty, I prepared some carrot and cucumbers for another round and discovered that the juicer would not turn on. I tried pressing the trip switch. I tried cleaning every part of the juicer. I tried waiting a few minutes, waiting an hour, waiting a few hours, and I tried it again the next day.It seems the motor had inexplicably died.The omega 02 was returned the following day.I have to say, it was an extremely cute, seemingly sturdy machine and very easy to clean.Its inability to function after the extraction of a single glass of juice was therefore fairly disappointing."
4,Love my small wonder Omega 02,"This Omega 02 have oval shaped feeding chutes that are large enough for a half or at least a quarter of an apple.It's give a little splash when I juice the orange,but over all this little juicer is get the job done very well.I use it every day.And Thanks Amazon,I placed my order and within the same week I received my product. I would definitely order from Amazon again."
5,An Excellent Starting Point,In just over 300 very readable pages the author provides an excellent overview of Medieval Europe with plenty of leads for a deeper inquiry. Well worth the time.
2,Couldn't hold my attention,"I guess I'm just too used to quality fiction. This book seemed rather dry at times, and I found myself finishing a paragraph and not remembering what it was about. In addition (although this is really just a pet peeve of mine), there were sentence fragments that served no artistic purpose and would have been better rendered as full sentences."
1,Not worth the money,I was very disappointed in this product. The very first time I wore this it broke. I clipped it to my waistband and during my walk it worked it's way off of my waistband and fell to the ground. It hasn't worked since. It will not talk or display any information. I would not recommend this pedometer to anyone.
1,Talking Calorie Counter Pedometer,"The product was hard to assemble. The directions were not detailed enough to explain how to pull the tab to install the battery. As a result, I spent almost $30.00 for a product that I ended up breaking before I could use it!!"
2,Agree,I just read the previous review and I unfortunately must agree. I had exactly the same experience. I e-mailed the company about the warranty but it is less expensive to buy a new one after you pay shipping. I really liked the concept but it is not very sturdy and if you are doing a walking program there are probably better choices.
3,Good addition to a walking program,My friend recommended this product and so far I have found out to be accurate and worth it. The voice takes a little to get use to but overall would recommend.
1,Don't waste your time,I was skeptical about a book just on this subject. I was right. There is no real insight here. Don't waste your time or money/
4,Good music sense.,"This group has a good sense of music that makes this album so fantastic. The songs to note are Colours, Mister feeling, ocean bizarre and la ola hand in hand. The idea of remixing the song I want to break free has, nevertheless fallen flat on its face emphasizing the need for the band to preserve it originality. But for this blemish, its a great album."
5,"Basic, simple and gold plated","Typical 3.5mm cable. The one that works and continues to work. I still have some back in the 90s that still work and have bought others on here that didn't work first time around. You know why? USA vs CHINA! We made quality products, but because corporations didn't see the value of ""PROFIT"" from that, they decided to go overseas with very low quality material that can be mass produced. We the consumers are now quality control, considering how much of the same is produced, in another country. Capitalism at its worse, this the perfect example. How many times must you buy the same thing before it actually works?"
5,More fun than a human being should be allowed to have!,"I love Rush Limbaugh and this book is a summary of the whole listening experience. The author has very well targeted his work and I wish him the best of success. This book is his way of creating his own job which is something Rush has always talked about. If you like Rush, then this book will have you laughing all day long. The recipes are so funny!"
5,Thoroughly Entertaining,"This was the perfect prescription for the murder-mystery doldrums. I have come to expect witty repartee, engaging plotlines, laugh-out-loud comedy, and fascinating characters from Reginald Hill, and this book did not disappoint. I didn't realize it was four stories in one book, and I found nothing lacking in this format. A glimpse into the early days and future days of our favorite boys - Pascoe and Dalziel - was indeed a treat. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone, and especially to fans of Reginald Hill. Nobody will be disappointed!"
4,"Good, but soon could be outdated","The information in this book is useful because you don't have to search through long stretches of text. There are many websites, and insights on things such as airline deals, car purchases, and home mortgages. The only problem is that these websites and good deals that the book explains may not be there in 2 or 3 years. So buy the book if you need information now, but don't expect the information to be pertinent forever."
2,An ok book on Wall St,"Got a few info ideas and knowledge from the book. However, the book could be 95% better. I would look for another book on this subject. From what a friend told me, there are several that are 100 x more powerful. Save your money on this one, and find something your money is worth spending."
3,"Good, but there is no secrets revealed.","For those of us who consciously look for better ways to manage our lives as business already know most of what the book covers. In addition, if you read the Wall Street Journal like I do, you will notice that this book is a good compilation of the previous WSJ articles.Again, there is nothing wrong with the book content. In fact, it is good and easy to follow. However, there was no ""WOW, REALLY?"" factor that I was looking for."
4,guides to different areas of life,"I think if you live in NYC and 'know' about things then this book is a little remedial because we are exposed to so much here already that this book only enforces things. However, there were one or two things I didnt know about that I was glad to read about so in that, this book was worth it."
5,Quite Simply: A Masterpiece,"Now retired, I have been the president of a university and have served in the U.S. Government in several capacities. James Moore's One Nation Under God has struck me like few other books. I can only appreciate how difficult and painstaking it was to put together this work. In the end, I have found it to be nothing less than a masterpiece, and I do not sue that term lightly. To take a wholly original idea like this and bring it to fruition the way this author has done is extraordinary. I thought he was eloquent and brought our spiritual history to life."
5,A Gift to America,"As a clergyman I confront people on a spiritual level continuously. I listen to them, try to comprehend their problems, and then give them comfort and counsel along the way. One Nation Under God has given me a perspective on spirituality that I did not even learn in seminary. Bringing together the story of America and prayer over time has brought new revelations to me. I was able to think of the famous and not so famous Americans and the challenegs they confronted in their lives. It has given me new insights into my own ministry. Every minister, priest, rabbi, and imam should have a ready copy of this book on his or her shelf. I would love to see One Nation Under God be required reading in our schools. The author James Moore is to be commended on delivering a powerful testament to the deep spirituality of our people. I already have ordered several copies of the book for several of my fellow clergy."
5,Excellent Book!!!,"This book is definately, ""A Spiritual History of America"". Jammed with history as seen from a spiritual PV. I highly recommend this book to history buffs, spiritual/religious buffs and prayer buffs/warriors."
5,A Magic Carpet Ride,Loved this book from start to finish. Everyone should revel in what this author has put together. One Nation Under God will have a long shelf life.
2,System Overheats,"This system runs HOT, make it unsatble.Also the Overclocking is not working.buyers look for diffrent Computer, AMD Athlon makes more stable computers.Also the CD burner freezes once in a while, and makes the system to restart.If you are a begiiner don't buy this computer."
2,Common knowledge,"For those that have been following the Z3, this book does not provide anything new if you have subscriptions to some of the more popular car magazines. Every page is a copy of an article on this or that magazine. The book only serves to reinforce the already common knowledge (for most of us anyways) that this car: drives like a roadster, looks like a roadster, it is a roadster!! I only give it two stars because I was expecting a book with all the nitty-gritty information (IE. options available each year, engine introduction dates, etc)."
2,Reduntant and uninformative,"I was hoping for an inside look into the M Roadster but instead I found a book full of magazine clippings. Sure, they took the time to collect some articles written by magazines reviewing the car over the 6 years it was in production. But nothing to make the book worth $20+. I agree with the author of the other review ""Common Knowledge"". I wouldn't waste your money on it...sure felt like a waste to me."
3,"Offers some relief, but doesn't seem to help with bunion","I've been using Yoga Toes for about a month. They seem to help soothe tired feet, but not a lot of help for my bunion."
3,Not sure that they work,"To be fair I did not use them every day. They were very uncomfortable to wear. I do have a small foot, size 6.5, so I do not know if they would fit bettter for larger feet. I gave up and had a bunionectomy. Oh well."
3,good for stretching,"my feet get slight cramps just about every other day depending on what i am doing. they do give in between the toes a nice little stretch. especially my baby toe.im sure some would feel it more than others depending on how tight they are there. they sort of are uncomfortable for me but thats because i know its very tight, but that happens with any stretching exercise in tight places.also my toes have not been straight over a number of years so of course i do not think just wearing the yoga toes for a few hours a week over a period of months is going to all of a sudden make enough difference for me to see. but i do believe it will help to stop them from getting worse.it works for the top part of my feet but i need something else to stretch my foot around my arch & where the arch & heel meet."
1,Too Painful for Small Feet and Toes,"I bought this product with high hopes generated by the advertising.My feet are size 6 with short toes. The small size Yoga Toes is still large and bulky. You have to stretch your toes sideways to put Yoga Toes on your feet. For me the stretch is too intense and very painful. I could endure the pain of using this item for only 15 minutes before it was unbearable.I cannot keep these on my feet long enough to see any therapeutic value.What an expensive disappointment! If you have small feet, don't waste your money on this item."
2,Get some lose some,"I bought a pair for myself as a Christmas present b/c I have noticed that my toes are getting more squished together due to the excessive wearing of dress shoes for work and it just doesn't look attractive when you are in your earlier 20's. I was so estatic about them that i've been wearing them since i got them back in Dec '08 and have been wearing them at least every other day for hours b/c it doesn't seem to stretch or hurt in the beginning but now after 30+min i do feel some pain but to my disappointment, after taking them off my toes are still the same. Don't know what it is doing but it's not making my toes return to it's natural alignment like it said it's suppose to. On the plus side though, it is GREAT for pedicures b/c it keeps your toes nicely separated as the nail polish dries, so no smudging."
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed that this toy barely lasted a week with two year olds using is. Handles broke off completely, leaving only a seat, which couldn't be used."
4,o.k toy,I do like this toy. It helps baby walk when they are just starting and they can ride it when they get older . It is also very durable. But for the price I would recomend buying a better one cause this is so plain.
1,"Cheap, lightweight, unsafe","This a very basic toy, cheaply made and without any special features. Spend at least $20 more on a heavier, more substantial ride-on vehicle for your child. My two-year-old son fell forward and cut open his chin on our cement patio while slowly driving this toy. This toy is unsafe because it is very lightweight and the front end is not heavy enough to prevent a child from falling forward."
5,Quality as expected!,"It's a brand I trust so I was not disappointed in the toy, plus my grandson thinks it's the cats meow as well! It helps with teaching him to walk and to be less afraid to move around on his feet since he has something to hang onto. My only concern was with the company that shipped it as It came in a box that was unsealed and open on one end and had bird poop on it! It was a tad upsetting to have to was and disinfect the toy before I could put it together and give it to him."
2,hard to navigate,This toy is great but it's wheels don't turn at all so it is very hard to navigate and turn around. It also flips easily.
4,Little Tykes Push & Ride,I bought this all plastic cart/bike for my 18 month old son. He loves it. I highly recommend it for children under two years of age. He rides in both indoors and out.
3,Little times,I thought the toy was alright. It was easy enough to put together but after I pulled out of the box I really wish it looked like the one in the picture that I ordered
5,wonderful toy to share,"I bought this for my twin granddaughters first birthday and I had considered two, the girls have great fun with this toy, one pushes while the other rides and they take turns pushing and riding"
1,defective upon receipt,Little Tykes Push & Ride Racer was defective upon receipt. Holes were not drilled for the screws. Recipient's parents had to return to the manufacturer. Very disappointed. Expected better quality.
4,One Year Old Took to this ASAP,"How surprised was I that my granddaughter who could not walk, when placed upon the seat, took off instantly and figured out how to get over bumps and even lift it up a bit to go around corners. She is so little that it it's so strange seeing her ride the thing like a harley. I too agree that this simple model is small and practical and I like that her focus is on riding not playing with bells and whistles. The very worst part of this toy is assembling it but this must be where the cost savings comes in, since the box size could have housed the body of this all put together to start with, minus the handles."
5,Little Tikes Push & Ride the Perfect Gift,"I purchased this toy for my nephew's first birthday. It turned out to be his favorite gift above all the others, including a little car that he could be pushed in.My husband put it together in about 15 minutes with no problems. Everything went together easily and nothing broke while inserting the pieces. It even comes with extra wheels in case you need them later on. My nephew isn't quite walking by himself yet and this gave him that little bit of security that he needed. He was even pushing it around in the grass with no problems. It is sturdy enough that even with him being wobbly it did not tip over. His legs aren't quite long enough to touch the ground yet but I am sure he will be happy with it for a long time to come.I would definitely recommend this to any one with a small child."
1,not happy...very unsafe,ok we bought it we loved it the price was great BUTour son pushed and he got his feet caught all of a suddenand flipped forward and hurt himself pretty bad rug burns on his face not to mention he also is scared now!!! i have put the toy away and am waiting for a reply from little tykes about returning it i dont think i should have to pay the shipping costs when it is their problem they didnt make sure it wouldnt flip
2,Poorly made and difficult to put together!,"I just put this together today, and my daughter hasn't had a chance to really use it yet, so I can't comment on durability, how much she likes it, etc. However, I felt compelled to write this immediately due to the inordinate amount of time and effort it took me to put this thing together. First of all, the pieces are extremely cheap looking, and they don't even seem to fit together properly- in fact, I worry that there may be some safety hazards (gaps between pieces, loose pieces, etc.). Assembly requires a hammer and a piece of plywood!?!? And you have to really hammer- it isn't just for popping things into place.I should have just put it back in the box to return but once I started it, I was determined to put it together."
4,Mission essential,"This is a good push/ride toy for your money. The wheels were a little aggravating to put together, but for Miss A (our 11 month old daughter), it was love at first sight. She started climbing all over it and pushing it around immediately. She has really learned to balance more on her feet, and has started walking unassisted, two weeks later. It does not steer left or right, which keeps it from wobbling away, and seems to be a nice weight: light enough to be manipulated, but not so light that it goes flying out from underneath the kid when she leans on it. As a new mom who's a little on the OCD side about procuring safe, efficient baby products, I say go for it."
3,Not that great-yet,"We recently put this together for our 9 month old son since he's now walking around a bit holding the furniture. Putting it together wasn't complicated but the wheels did require a little patience.He's not able to sit in it comfortably yet. We've also tried to use it as a walker and that hasn't worked too well so far either. The toy is too light-when my son leans on it for support, it pushes forward faster than is stable for him.It's also a very simple toy compared to the other ride ons you can get at Toys-R-Us for a similar price.He likes it when we push him around on it, but he's not totally comfortable on it and pushing him around can be tiring. It would be great if this came with a push handle for the parents though, but I guess that would raise the price.I am hoping he'll grow into it soon. If he starts liking it more, I'll change my ratingupdate: as he became comfortable with this toy, my son grew to love it. he loved riding around on the deck with it."
4,A great first rider,"My son had this same toy when he was little and we just recently bought one for my daughter. It is nice in that it encourages walking behind it as a push toy and is also a very stable ride on toy. It is simple, yet sturdy and well designed. It encourages imaginative play and has just enough space behind the ""driver"" for a small stuffed animal or blankie to also ride."
4,"Great for developing walking skills, not much else","Like probably most other parents, we purchased this for our toddler to aid her in developing walking skills. The car is well-suited for this. She enjoys pushing it around the house, and the practice she obtained from it has paid off.Assembly was straightforward. Just make sure to follow the directions.The only downside I see to this toy is that due to its size, once your toddler begins walking and grows a little larger, it will no longer get as much use (if it gets any at all)."
5,Love and Plush Vash the Stampede,I love this plushie. It makes Vash look so cute. Warning though. This plush and heat do not mix. I put my Vash in the back of my car and the heat made the bottom part of his shoes fall off. It was simple to fix. A little cement and clamps and he was as good as new. Vash now spends his time on my bed with my other plushies.
3,"Good directions, but not very detailed maps","I bought this book, because I visited the area in June and want to go back in November. This is challenging wilderness to naviagate, and I wouldn't suggest you do it without a GPS. I too wish that the maps had been more detailed, the Tellico Plains map available through the Ranger station is more so. It is a great book, just was hoping for more knowledge gained, and it basically told me what I already know."
2,Not enough detail,"In the spirit of graphic novels, this pamphlet (since it is scarcely large enough to be called a book) uses very few words to describe the top 101 graphic novels of all time.And that is the problem. I'm sure the internet is full of opinions on the graphic novel ""canon"". I wanted something MORE than just a bibliography, sorted alphabetically by author.Each book has no more than a four sentence summary with a rating to suggest whether it would be suitable for kids, youths or adults. I would have expected:* author/illustrator bios* ratings for plot, characters, design, artwork etc* ranking of the books in orderAny connection between the attention span of a typical comic book reader and the brevity of this book? You can draw your own conclusions.If you're interested in the different visual techniques of storytelling, check out the Scott McCloud or Will Eisner books on the subject.Very disappointing."
3,Watermarked!,"Oh, Alpha Video, I bet that intermittent Watermark is going to save you millions in lost revenue from the Public Domain Film pirates! A Watermark? REALLY? (Film: 5 Stars. Alpaha Video: 1 Star)"
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this movie because it has Freddie Bartholomew in it. But, much to my disappointment, it is a very low budget movie, and Freddie has only a small role. It is nothing like Captains Courageous or any of his other wonderful movies.This DVD ended up in the trash, because I would be embarrassed to even give it away to someone."
5,Classic on the Scottish monarchy,"From his description of Alexander III being installed at Scone in 1249 -- in rites reminiscent of a pagan tribal chief instead of the Christian monarch of a western European nation -- to the sparsely attended coronation of James VI three centuries later (the result of a precarious revolution that deposed his predecessor), the author explores the reign of each monarch and sets him (or her) against the broader canvas of European history. Donaldson is one of the foremost authorities on Scottish history up to the unification of the island and his scholarship is impeccable, but he also has a happy talent for clear and colorful narrative. A good overview of the dynastic machinations and complex foreign relations that kept the Scottish mon-archy on its toes."
2,JANE EYRE - Standard Definition Upcovert,"This Echo Bridge/Miramax double feature is another case of 'good news, bad news'. While the presentation of ""Becoming Jane"" (which has previously been released on Blu-Ray) is similar to its past incarnations in the format, the HD debut of the 1996 JANE EYRE from Franco Zeffirelli is a huge disappointment. The AVC encoded HD transfer included here in Echo Bridge's Blu-Ray looks very much like a standard-definition upscale with heavy filtering and scant detail in evidence. It's not just a case of DNR being applied - the image itself looks like straight up standard-def, just with superior color reproduction than DVD. Don't buy it if you're only interested in ""Jane Eyre."""
3,For the die hard,Hunter is the man But you need to be a die hard fan to get this book because it is very short and isn't the most interesting thing you have every read. but it is good for collectors.
2,Just not worth the money.,"Makes me wish I was famous and had some unpublished material to cash in on. You should be ashamed of yourself Hunter. Decent material, but $12? Has the value equation completely left our culture?"
1,Huh?,"Although an interesting read, it sure as hell wasn't worth the price! This little book should have donated as a side dish. I guess you could say we got screwed, Jack!I can hear Hunter laughing in hell right now...."
1,yeah -- I got screwed alright,"Hunter must be in some need of serious funds these days --- maybe he wants to fill his swimming pool with ether instead of water.I've bought and enjoyed many a book by this pig f%$!er, but this will be the last. The text is too large, the story too short and boring.""Buy a ticket, take the ride"" --- whatever, man. He's not had any growth as an author since the 70s. I guess antiques have their place in the world."
2,Just not worth the money.,"Makes me wish I was famous and had some unpublished material to cash in on. You should be ashamed of yourself Hunter. Decent material, but ...? Has the value equation completely left our culture?"
4,"""Down to the Last 30 Minutes""","The official FIA review of the 1997 F1 World Championship, featuring on board cameras from all the leading cars and of course all 17 great races in Jacques Villeneuve's first Formula One title season. 130 minutes. If you have never seen these FIA official videos, 1997 is a good place to start, with the riveting diuel betwen Villeneuve and Michael Schumacher. Unmissable!"
2,Disappointing,"I thought this book was terrible. The smells were of only two varieties -- floral or sulphuric. The history lessons were poor and disjointed, and my two boys quickly lost interest."
4,Simple and Straightforward,I just started reading this book and have found easy and sound explanations as to why it is important to read and study scripture. I am enjoying the straightforwardness of this book so far into the first couple of chapters.
3,Only the few know scripture,"R. C. Sproul's little book on how to know scripture is a must read for all Christians who want to be insulted. According to Sproul, interpreting scripture must be left to the experts who can figure out all the social, political, and linguistic variables of the time. Really what he seems to be saying is that you have to be R. C. Sproul or the Pope or someone of equal rank to be able to understand scripture. Don't waste your time....just start reading Genesis Chapture One, Verse One, and go on from there."
5,Top Of the line.,"I have been using this system for a while now, I must say it is very fast! I did some comperasment to Penium4 1.8 Nothwood.The Athlon 1800+ smoked Penium4 in almost evry aspect.Without a doubt AThlon XP is much faster from Peniums (same clock) Athlon have diffrent architecture from Penium4, they meke more operation per second thats why the are faster.Athlon XP + Windows XP = Extreeme Perfomace"
1,Yesterday's news,Give me a break! The Athlon 1800+ (which only runs at 1.50GHZ - don't be fooled) is a dinosaur. It is more than 1GHZ behind the top of the line. Why spend over a grand for this when you can get a 2GHz + machine for the same money?And the graphics on this thing are even worse - ancient technology from a tiny chipset company. Did you know that the embeded graphics (not a card) doesn't even have it's own memory? It steals it from your main memory.Stay away from this thing - it's too little for too much.
4,It replaced 5 other remotes.,"Not all of my components are Sony. After purchasing a Sony universal remote that was supposed to be compatabible with all my components, but wasnt, I bought this one that had the learning function. It takes a while to ""learn"" every command, but it works great and is comfortable to hold. The only thing I am worried about is when the batteries die. The memory will only be saved for a few hours and if you dont change the batteries in time, you lose everything."
1,Won't even work on Sony Equipment!,I was very disappointed that the remote would not work w/ my Sony DVD player. I tried to program it all of the ways in the instructions & also called cust svc. It also will not program w/ my Denon stereo & my Sharp VCR. It did program for my TV & Cable Box. I've never had so much trouble with a remote.
1,Cheap Cameras using 2xAA batteries shipped to me instead of advertised camera!,"I have contacted the seller concerning this issue and will let you know if they resolved it. I expect to receive the product I purchased, not a cheap substitute."
3,Cool SurveillanceCamera,this surveillance camera is so cool i can keep a eye on who coming in my room .with this camera i can keep my sister out my room because i know when she coming so that i can lock the door
4,when culture is marketing,"This book is not about how to market culture. Moreless this book is the observations and experimentations in life as observed by one person.While he is exceptionally funny, this book is as much about how his fathers closet shaped his personality as it is about marketing.The whole point of the book is how everything intertwines. A favorite part of mine is when he gets lost in an amazing painting in an abstract art gallery, only to find he is lost in reality."
3,"""no-brow"" writing but good information","Seabrook has an excellent story to tell-- that of how our marketing mind has changed; how America now creates product with intrinsic marketing. He makes the transition to a marketing culture understandable in an ""oh-yes, I knew that!"" sort of way. However, at times to book feels like a first draft as his writing style sinks to casual information rather than knowledgeable reporting. A worthy read if you have anything to do with marketing/selling/creating/envisioning...it gives you an better understanding of today's aged 15-35 buying psychology!"
2,No Reason For Reading Nobrow,"In what reads like a series of loosely-related magazine pieces strung together, Seabrook displays his profound grasp of the obvious. Seabrook thinks his rich daddy was hibrow because he read the New Yorker and appereciated High Art - Sonny Boy doesn't understand that the New Yorker was always middlebrow, and that his father's passions were an aspiring aristo joke. Seabrook thinks he's different from Rich Dad because he likes the Chemical Brothers. Wow! Is he just slumming, or does he really not get the implicit irony? And do we really need to be told this again? I think not."
2,More on nobrow,"I searched amazon under ""nobrow"" and discovered another book on the same sumject, though infinitely better than Seabrook's self-indulgent musings (see the first 3-4 reviews below, they tell the whole story). From Lowbrow to Nobrow by Peter Swirski is lucid, engaging, intellectually stimulating and funny, on top of leaving Seabrook's superficial analysis in the dust (nobrow literary culture, it appears has been around for a century at least).In fact I'd go so far as to say Swirski's book (released very recent too) is the ultimate study of the subject, at least according to the dean of popular culture studies, Ray Browne, who praises it in the editorial. Check it out for yourself, you're in for hours of happy reading."
2,An Overblown New Yorker Article,"Although the title looked enticing, I was greatly disappointed as I read this slim volume. I was vaguely told what ""Nobrow"" was, but no whys, no wherefores. Was it a celebration of Nobrow or a critique? The book contains profiles of what the author sees as noted Nobrow figures, like David Geffen and George Lucas. They seemed to be re-edited New Yorker articles, and are nice as they go, but after 200 or so pages, I still don't have much of a clue as to what Nobrow really is. I did, however, learn who the author was. He seems to be the sub-text of this book. We know he is a feature writer at the New Yorker, a Princeton grad, and lives somewhere in Tribeca. If you want to read a book about today's culture and its roots, read Thomas Franks' The Conquest of Cool. If you want to read a book about the New Yorker, try Bright Lights, Big City. At least it's more honest."
2,I second alot of what other people say,"This book is very self indulgent. I can't think of any bad things to say about this book that have not already been said. Seabrook has a flimsy Idea of what he thinks Nobrow means and builds it up to be a philosophy that doesn't really get executed. The only good things about this book are the four or five interesting stories about the behind the scenes of MTV, Star Wars/Lucas, Ben Kweller and so on. Mind you these subjects are only loosely drawn into his mindless philosophy. I was hoping I would like this book, I was very dissapointed."
4,"Good, but not brilliant","I was lucky enough to receive an uncorrected proof of this novel. Despite my optimistic enthusiasm, I was slightly let down by the book. It reads like an MTV video with choppy edits of memoir mixed in with moments of pseudo-epiphany. He puts into words many ideas that I have been thinking, but not in an analytical, sociological sense. Rather, he takes the approach of personal cultural experiences as evidence of larger cultural trends. I found the chapters to be somewhat random and unconnected; however, in the end he did tie in all concepts/chapters rather nicely in order to prove his thesis. Nobrow is an interesting look at the commercialization & marketing of culture and art, though I was hoping for something of the magnitude and strength of Dery's Escape Velocity or Rushkoff's Coercion."
1,This book...,"This book is terrible. I got through the first few ""chapters' well enough, but it felt like the author kept saying and espousing the same rhetoric over and over again. On my second day of reading, I was really fed up with this book. I left it on the city bus for someone else to pick up and read... there's really nothing new offered in this book, especially since its now so out-dated."
3,Indulgent and not very informative,"I was disappointed that Seabrook so cursorily examined the topic of this book. It's important, and much more easily explained using examples chosen from outside the author's personal experience as a writer for Tina Brown's The New Yorker. Even the examples he chooses from that indisputably interesting time aren't very well fleshed out in defense of his thesis. Readers interested in this topic might be better served by joining Adbusters."
1,A silly little book.,"Is this some sort of dismal trend? A New Yorker ""writer"" taking a dumb little idea that he undoubtedly thinks is brilliant, worth at best a few hundred words as an op-ed piece in the New York Post, and instead inflating it into an overpriced, overhyped book that would float on helium? First Malcolm Gladwell and now John Seabrook.... No wonder the New Yorker is what it is today."
1,Awful beyond description,"The main problem with this book is that the content is totally unrelated to the title. The title puts forth that the book will discuss how marketing has affected American culture, but the book constitutes no such treatise. Instead, the reader is assaulted with a series of the author's autobiographical vignettes. Despite Seabrook's best efforts to tie these together with the occasional sentence or two about marketing, the tales remain disjunct. Further, they're totally uninteresting! I kept reading in the hope that the book would match up to the promise of its cover description, but it never did. What a waste of money and time."
4,"Almost comforting, in a weird way","How can one be criticize culture when the absolute standards of measurement have been replaced by cultural relativism? The answer wouldn't satisfy fans of Robert Pirsig; Quality has been replaced by ""Authenticity"", which is generally defined as whatever the opinion polls say it is. Although Seabrook is no sociologist, this very interesting behind-the-scenes look at big-time media players is enjoyable food for thought, and even strangely comforting."
2,Self-consuming Seabrook Comes up Short,"This book read more like Seabrook's autobiography and should have been titled ""My New Yorker Years"". What's the difference between the culture of marketing and the marketing of culture (and more importantly, what's the relevant argument here)? After two hundred odd pages, it beats me."
3,Nobrow indeed.,"This book was tossed around in a conversation along with the likes of the ""brand and culture"" work of Naomi Klein, so I put it on my list and finally got around to it.The book is very informal; I was looking for some real media or culture critique. In fact, that was what kept me reading: I hoped to stumble upon the meat of the book. But it never came. The book, at the end, reads more like Seabrook's attempt at an urban hipster's autobiography. He spends just as much time talking about his pursuit of $200 tshirts and how others react to them as he does about actual social theory. Moreso, actually.The book isn't awful; I'd still recommend that anyone who finds the cover blurb of interest to pick it up as it's a quick short weekend read. But enjoy it more as a slightly intellectual gossip rag, because that's really the overall feeling I was left with after reading it."
1,cameron files: pharoah curse,this game does not work on my computer either it will have to be sent back because it will not play with a 64 bit computer.
3,not quite as good as cameron-loch ness,I think the graphics and music were a little better than loch ness but i think the storyline of loch ness is a little better.Just like the first one it would have been a little better if all the doors could have been entered.Both cameron files in general were good and i hope they make a cameron files 3.
3,Not what it might have been,"The first game of the series was a fine one, and I was hoping for great things from Cameron Files 2. Unfortunately they seem to have taken all the wrong lessons from CF 1. Instead of making this one better, they just made it ... faster.Gameplay is simple, though it's easy to get turned around in a 360-degree environment, but there's little interaction, and what there is doesn't make much sense. The puzzles in general don't make much sense. And the whole thing is far too short; the story just quits without explaining or wrapping up all the loose ends. You find yourself staring at the end credits going, ""Where's the rest of the game?""On the plus side, it's inoffensive and pretty. And what else is out there while we wait for the new ""Full Throttle"" game?"
2,What went wrong?,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first 'Cameron Files' game. It was atmospheric, the characters were quirky, and interesting, and the story line was reasonably consistent. It wasn't the best Adventure game I've ever played, but it gave me a few evenings of harmless amusement.As for the sequel......It seems incomplete. The story line has gaps, there are characters who appear, contribute nothing to the plot, then disappear (What was the telepathic Russian countess all about, for heaven's sake?). There are puzzles which lead nowhere - like the 'coded' message found on an Enigma machine, which turned out to be a depressingly simple cipher and which wasn't used later in the game. The settings were bland and uninteresting; the designers could have learned something from Riddle of the Sphinx.I can't help suspecting that it was rushed out in time for Christmas?Was it the worst Adventure game I've played? No. I reserve that honour for 'Jekyll and Hyde'. It was a close second, though."
1,So linear it should be a ruler,"I didn't care for the first Cameron Files, so I didn't expect much from this, the second one -- and I was right. It is so linear that it's boring and illogical (you can't leave the hotel without first finding certain items in your own room -- what sense does THAT make?)Plus, the movement is tedious and repetitive. You end up going around in circles trying to figure out what the game wants you to do next (not what makes any sense).I managed about one hour's game time before I uninstalled it. Well, that's an hour of my life I'll never get back!On the plus side, it installed -- and uninstalled -- without a glitch. Big deal."
3,Good Graphics Okay Gameplay,The graphics are really good.the players look alomst real life-like.the create a team options is really cool.they should add in some logos.the create a player mode should add more cool stuff that you can put on your player.the game is pretty easy up until the last quarter because if the computer is losin then they just magically start throwing and catching big long hail marys.then they just magically score.overall i give this game a 3 star rating.
4,Great small pillow,"I have the small size pillow, mainly because I didn't realize it was a small when I bought it. We recently went on a road trip/camping trip last week and this came in very handy. While it is too small for me to use as a sleeping pillow at night, it is great for in the car or on a plane. I kept falling asleep in the car and it was very comfy/. You just have to give it a good 10-20 minutes to fluff up after you unwrap it, then it's nice and fluffy/comfy. If you were going to get a camping pillow to use at night, I'd recommend that you spring for the larger one. A bit pricy but worth it."
3,"Decent, but not what I was hoping for.","I was hoping for something with a little more insight into dentistry, with more practical advice on how to get into a dental school, with more ideas of how to prepare now as a pre-dental student. It was useful in some aspects of different fields of dentistry and gave me a better idea of the DAT, which I dont know much about because it's still a good year off. This book is useful if have no idea about going into dentistry or on the fence and want to know more."
3,Reasonable guide...more relevant information now on the web,"The guide itself was a good ""warm up"" to some key areas that may be helpful in getting into dental school. Some of the examples in the book were not as good as some of the ones that I have seen online. Although this is not a bad reference guide, I would use it as a guide and not depend on its information to get me into dental school."
3,Interesting piece,"I think that had I bought this book a year ago it would have been a better purchase for me but since I'm already set on being a dentist and just needed the study guides for the DAT, this book was just a good add-on with the price Amazon had. It is still useful for me but not near as much as it could be for students trying to decide if they would like to become a dentist."
2,don't waste your money,This book is just a waste. It is old and outdated. Just go to SDN for any info you need to apply to dental school.
2,"Nice Looking, But Design Is Flawed","The appearance of the box is basically attractive in the photo's offered online. When it arrived, I was surprised to find out the front stayed at an angle. To remove the top you must slide the top piece out and off, the lid does not lift up. Because the front is at an angle, when your not using it to hold a recipe card, it is difficult to store the box. The slanted front makes it wider and it takes up a lot more space. I just think if the top lifted up, it would be easier and faster to look through the cards without taking the whole top on and off.So for storage it doesn't work very well and for ease of use it's not the best design. The description would have been better if it had mentioned that the top and slanted front were one piece. The over all quality seems fine, but I feel the design is not the best it could be. I would not recommend this item."
5,Mom Loves it!,"I purchased this for my mom for Mother's Day. She's always had a habit of carrying more keyrings than keys, and it's always bugged me. This year, I decided that the only way I could change things was to buy one thing that replaced all the others. This is it! The squirt has everything she needs, it's compact, and best of all, it's BLUE! It's much more compact than I first realized, but I think that's a plus, not a negative. The scissors are spring loaded, which makes them great for one handed use. I'm not sure the tweezers are very functional, but other than that, this thing is ""totally awesome"" as my mom put it!"
2,Poor quality,"When I got this, the blade looked like it was thin and of lower quality. Sure enough, the tip chipped off three months later, doing something that I had no problem with while using a Leatherman Micra. In general, it's a very portable tool that is easily carried around, and should be used for small tasks."
5,Great Tool,This is a great tool; it is very reliable and perfect for any little job. The only thing I would change is to add a can opener for camping/backpacking trips. The pliers and everything else on the tool are all perfect. I do find that it seems to always be slipping out of my pocket because it's so small and slick (I lost my 1st one this way). All in all it's a 5/5.
4,Leatherman Squirt a durable tool,"After owning a succession of Leatherman Micra knives, and having become increasingly unhappy with their manufacturing quality since Leatherman moved their manufacturing from Portland to China, I decided to try one of their newer brands. The Squirt is a similar tool to the Micra, but smaller, and has all the same tools. One thing I like better is that the tweezer tool is free-standing and can be used away from the knife. The scissors work well, and the fact that the blades and screwdrivers are accessible from the outside as opposed to the Micra's all-inside access is something I like quite a lot.Good tool, decent price. I tend to forget having these things in my pocket and TSA owns quite a few of mine. I'd buy another."
5,Quality,"I have owned at least a dozen Leatherman Micra's and now two Leatherman Squirts. Thanks to Airport Security, I refresh knives often... I'll never go back to the Micra since owning a Squirt. The quality of the Squirt seems far better engineered than the Micra. The rivets, blades, hinges, springs and everything just feel much better during use. I would highly recommend the Squirt S4."
5,Leatherman Squirt multitool,"I gave this as a gift to my boss who has ""everything"". I wasn't sure if he would be thrilled but I was pleasantly surprised when he absolutely loved it. He couldn't stop talking about it. He says he uses it for everything and anything. The size makes it convenient to carry around and keep it handy for any emergency."
5,The most useful thing in my pocket.,"Ever since picking up this little doodad I've been using it. Endless amounts of mail, threads, and even boxes have fallen to its deceptive might. The little blade it comes with is quite serviceable, but the scissors are far and away the best I've ever used in a portable context.The flat Phillips head is also an amazingly convenient thing to have around.Even the tweezers have seen some use, something I can't say about my Swiss Army knives (for the most part because they get lost).I love this thing, and I refuse to leave the house without it."
4,Just the right pocket tool,I have had a pocket leatherman for the last 5 years and have worn out two other stainless pocket leatherman. I wanted to see if a new version was out finding the squirt S4.. The design is great because the knife and other tools open on the outside vs the stainless steal version which had all the tools open when the butterfly was open. Have had the squirt for a month. Like the looks and its functionality.. Leathermans are the only pocket size tool to have.
5,Excellent little tool that I can no longer live without,"Very hi quality tool that I have been carrying in my pocket for almost 2 years now. I use it to open boxes, cut my finger nails, cut cuticles...and many other things. Careful cutting tough things though. Shortly after I got it I gauged out part of the scissor blades cutting a nylon tie. But I still used it for a solid year or more after that.I recently had to hand it over too security when entering a concert at Nokia theater in Times Square....ridiculous. i wanted to gauge the guys eyes out!! I must get a new one!! I'm carrying around a Swiss Army Card right now, but it's not even close to the same."
2,You must be kidding or just out for Money?,"Do a google and see what scientific evidence suggests on this. Or easier take a magnet, hold it against your skin. Does YOUR blood rise to the surface at all, is there iron in your blood? Really? Think. Observe. Gad, Amazon should not have this type of thing for sale."
5,Excellent Remote,"The Skylink 68 works very well and it's easy to carry in pocket. With the included mounting bracket, it can be easily and conveniently mounted in the smallest of cars or in a dry spot on a motorcycle (it's not waterproof). It was very easy to program. The range of operation is a bit less than the full size original remote, but still far enough to open the door for entry without hesitation. The recessed button may help extend battery life if carried in pocket. I recommend this remote highly as a replacement or as an addition."
4,Good quality; range is limited,"This is the only garage door opener I could find that was both tiny and programmable. It comes with lots of switches, so no matter how many your system has, it will work. It does not work with ""intelligent"" or constantly-changing systems - you must have a code. It is good if you have an older system and need an extra opener for another vehicle, bike, or just on your keychain. It was easy to set and works perfectly well - however, I find that I have to be practically in my driveway before it works. This may be due to the placement of my receiver, or it may be the opener itself, I'm not sure which."
2,"too much electronic, too less roots","hi to every reggaeheart-beating guy out there,i listoned to bujus new album and was a little disappointed, because he has so much potential to become a legend like... marley, but isnt using it. his lyrics - great as usual. but dont buy an album just for the lyrics! musically, its preatty weak! very much synthesizer und drummachines. not so much power and deep rhythem like in ""inna heights"" or ""til shiloh"", the best album he've made so far! buju can do it better! live on stage or in ""til shiloh"". this one is rather a moneymaker! check out a huge german reggae-album from ""sam ragga band"" and enjoy yourself! wmws"
2,Raw & Abrasive,"This is dancehall reggae reminding me of an updated Eddy Grant. I found his sound very raw & abrasive, especially when compared to the smoothness of a Bob Marley or Third World."
5,Another Excellent CD!!!,Excellent cd from Buju Banton and one of the all time great reggae producers Donovan Germain. From top to bottom this cd is an instant classic. Buju Banton has several songs on this cd that could easily enter the Billboards Top 100. Great CD......
3,wan mo kanxiousness,dis a disappointment to al hard core fans of buju.i mean iwas xpectin' somtin' greater dan inna heights/til shiloh
5,Friends for life,"Well this one was very difficult for me to rate, If I compare it to his greatest works, I would have to rate it a 3. If I look at the album as a fan of Buju, I have to give it a 5 because outside of Bob Marley he has done something with Reggae music that no cross-over Reggae artist can do. He inspires people, while creating dancehall tunes for people to enjoy. However, it is nice hearing Buju along with Bounty Killer, his long time partner in crime Beresford Hammond, and Marcus Garvey's speach followed by ""Up Ye Mighty Race."" Yet the one thing that hits me is the fact that Buju has realized that he has dancehall fans, roots rock reggae fan, and somewhat crossover fans, and he attempts to create space for each of these listeners on ""Friends For Life."""
4,it is really about friends for life,"buju still has that voice and beat that gives u a little chill i loved the cd but personally i am not to hot on the hip hop beats but in this cd he surely mad me overlook the beat in a few songs and fall into the words. he is expanding his already large variety of songs done in collaboration with other artist but he still know how to keep it real with the conscious vibe and also tell it how it is,""paid not played"" was one of the songs i admired most simply because of how the story was u know. he is still and hopefully always will be inspirational.i really want to see him and sizzla and capleton and anthony b do a collabo. i think it would be fantastic"
3,wouldn't know,"Haven't actually had the chance to read the ebook thereby I cannot honestly say one way or the other if it is a good product, however it it The Republic, a classic work of literature and it was free, so a great peice of work at a great price cannot be wrong."
3,The Republic,The book The Republic wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I had heard of the title in a movie I watched on TV about girls in juvenile prison to serve a term there. And there was a girl trying to get one of the in mates to read . And she was making quotes from the book. It sounded interesting. But I find it hard to get into.It is the type of book you could go back and refer back to something Plato had said and made a point of.All and all I wouldn't have bought it if I took it out in the library before hand and saw what it was like.Edna Orourke
2,Not great,"I love Plato's The Republic, but this copy is a bad translation, and there are no line numbers or footnotes. Buy a physical copy."
4,"Detailed, heavy but excellent","This is by no means a book you come home to at the end of the day after work and breeze through. Heavy and detailed, it is a fabulous read for anyone who wants to understand the foundations on which modern society were built."
4,Relevant Chapters,"I needed this book for a Philosophy Class, it helped me out, I thought I would help you all out and provide some locations to jump to:Book I: 3954Book II: 4707Book III: 5335Book IV: 6152V: 6855VI: 7712VII: 8402VIII: 9057IX: 9752X: 10332Hope this helps you!"
3,3948 to read the actual book.,You get what you pay for I suppose. Starts with a very long introduction or maybe you would call it a lecture about the book and Plato. If you want to just read the book itself you need to jump all the way to location 3948. Really needs at least a table of contents with 2 entries; one for the intro and one for the actual start of the book.
5,The Real Dr. No,"The Cold War has become the War on Terror...James Bond is a 20-year-old Chess Grandmaster and high school football hero...Ernst Stavros Blofeld has been transformed into Ayman al-Zawahiri. WHITE KING AND THE DOCTOR offers an original and thought-provoking look at the 21st Century's face of evil. Once upon a time when wars occurred on the battlefield in some other country, the face of evil used to be a caricature. Now it may be the face of the guy down the street. This novel points out very clearly that it is the small decisions each individual makes every day that really shape the destiny of our world. Take the time to not only enjoy it but to read it carefully."
5,Great Read!,"I loved this book! Ms Kessler has a gift for story telling. Her characters are entirely believeable, and the storyline is as well. It is suspenseful, she weaves subplots throughout the book, and the ending is unexpected. I couldn't put it down!"
4,White King Doctor,I am amazed at how close to the truth this book of fiction was. I recomend it for all people who are interested in the present situation in the middle east
1,Sportline Pulse Pedometer 355,"I have used my Sportline Pulse Pedometer 355 for four days and the [flimsy] plastice belt clip has already broken. The device itself is fine, but the belt clip is a piece of [junk]. Do not purchase this item!"
5,Heaven on Earth,"This collection is a musthave for long-standing fans of Jim's beautiful voice. I once had the opportunity of seeing him LIVE at the local armory, and I will never forget the power of his beautiful singing, and neither will anyone else who was there. I give this album FIVE STARS!"
5,Dodgers baseball cap,This is a quality made cap. My eight year old son has been wearing it nonstop. He loves it!
5,Cat Stevens on Vinyl,What can one say except it's the incomparable Cat Stevens and it's on vinyl. Real music exactly as it was intended to be heard!
3,Ok Stroller,"If I had to do it over again, I would buy a different stroller. It is very light and fits in my small vehicle's truck, however I have now seen other strollers that shade a baby better. I like to walk everyday and I could never keep the sun off of my baby. The canopy part just doesn't pull down very far. The color is nice and I haven't had any problems with functioning the stroller. My baby LOOKS a little uncomfortable in it, but I don't think she is. She never fusses in it."
1,You get what you pay for!,"In this case, a cheaply-made product. After a year and a half of average-to-light use, it's got a weird bend to it, is practically impossible to snap open, and the wheels keep locking up, making steering it a pain. Buy a high-quality stroller to begin with; it's cheaper in the long run than buying this piece of junk and THEN buying a more expensive brand."
4,Good product,We liked this stroller b/c it's rated very high in the Consumer Reports for 2004. We started using it when our daughter was 3 months old in conjunction with the matching Snugride car seat. This is how we rate it...Good things:1. Lightweight2. Gender-neutral color3. Easy to maneuver - turns well4. Nice sized shopping basket5. Easy to use with the Snugride carrier6. Baby fits well when used alone7. Easy to get baby in & bucked or take out8. Huge canopyAnnoying things:1. Wheels are big so they easily get caught on displays in stores if it's a small area to get through2. When folding you need to lock the front wheels or else the stroller doesn't fold as easily
5,Love this stroller!,"We bought this stroller to go with our graco car seat and we love it! It folds so easily, is really light, and fits nicely in my trunk. It is great for manuevering around stores at the mall. The price was right too."
5,Insidiously Infectious,This CD is habit-forming! You'll find yourself listening to it (and singing along) over and over--even after you've put the kids to bed for the evening. Can't wait for Volume II!!
1,Not for me,"Let me start by saying I returned this, and not for a replacement.The main problem was that the metal bands were poorly constructed. Not just on my piece but by design. They held the latch at a crooked angle and were only holding the latch by being bent inward, a design which I can easily see bending out and becoming useless.My other problem (and I know this is partly my fault) is that they were too small. Only the largest of the four was of a decent size to use, and even then, it wouldn't fit a normal five pound bag of flour or sugar. The bottom two were absolutely useless unless you were wanting to store maybe some sugar packets.Overall, I didnt like them because of the size, but the construction quality is what made me actually return them.Ps. I also saw these at bed bath and beyond for 20 dollars, but they had the same lack of quality."
5,Almost -- but not quite -- too beautiful to use!,"Jet black, glossy, traditional yet up-to-date finish...these look ""heavenly"" on my granite countertop in my new kitchen. No fingerprints, and we use them daily for sugar, Splenda, tea bags and coffee bags. Have bought coordinating jet black kitchen ware including the Corelle Cafe Black dinnerware, and coordinating items from Typhoon and Waechten___(sp?) -- this is the ""classiest"" set I have ever had. Very fast and safe shipping -- A+++++ overall!"
3,Buyer,"I returned this item because one of the jars was crooked. I ordered a replacement, but it arrived broken. I sent the box back and got a refund. In general, the jars are all right. The only thing is lids will be difficult to wash because they are hollow."
1,Very poorly made snap handles,I bought these because they are black and they look sturdy.They aren't. The little metal handles you push down on to seal are bent and breaking off!Avoid them!
1,Cheaply made,"This product was very disappointing when I received it. Although they are pretty to look at on my counter... they do not work properly. Whenever I open the lid the latch falls off, and the lid never lines up properly. The spoons are too long for the container, so they tilt to the side. You are better off spending a little extra $ and get one that works right, especially if you use them daily... save yourself the frustration."
2,oggi canister,"i wish i hadn't bought this. i didn't measure right. it's not as tall as i want & can't wash the lids right. the inside of lid is hollow, have to dry to get moisture out."
2,Canister set,"Cheaply made, off-white, not white as stated. I do not plan to use them. They do close well, so they are good for protecting their contents."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"I've seen reviews that bash this product, but it's been great for me. Now we don't have to worry about missing a call from one of our kids when we're on line.The necessary steps are (1)get call-waiting from your phone company, (2) hook up the product so the phone line goes from your wall to the device, to your computer and phone, (3) make sure your PC's ""internet connections"" are not set to disable call waiting. That's it. Then when you're on line, the device rings when a call comes in. Simple as that."
2,Only works with a corded phone,"I bought this six months ago and finally gave up on it. It would work fine with an old corded phone, but would never disconnect from the modem line (although it would ring to let me know someone was calling) when using three different cordless phones. All I would hear was the modem screeching then then call was disconnected (along with me from my internet connection!). Total frustration! I'm going to try a controller based US Robotics v.92 modem (which claims to do much the same thing, only with caller-id)."
3,This comswitch requires Call Waiting.,The technical specifications for this comswitch do not inform the reader that the comswitch requires the purchaser to already have Call Waiting from their local telephone company.
2,catch-a-call disappointing,"The catch-a-call catchs my call, but it does not let me see who's calling and according to this device it is caller id compatible. Also my callers tell me my phone rings 3-4 times before i actually hear it ringing. Also box says it can put your computer on hold for 30 seconds. I'm lucky if it does 10 seconds. And when I do get off the phone before it disconnects, the computer will still disconnect 5 seconds after I hang up."
4,solving a problem,"B Brown: You can solve your problem very easily by reading the instructions. If you don't have them, send me a note & I will gladly Email them to you.rcbiers1@yahoo.com"
5,DOES WORK AND EASY!!!,"Picked up the CATCH A CALL at(TARGET) july 29 2003.Called phone company got call waiting,works great!! everytime!!IF i could use this so can you.The hard part taking it out of the package.VERY HAPPY! AND MADE IN U.S.A!!"
4,Gotta love 21st century technology,"I heard taht my phone company (Quest) is losing more money then they're making, partly do to people canceling 2nd lines. I believe it, with Catch-a-call, I don't need a second line just for computer. Unless I don't want to take the call, I can answer the phone and say that I'll call back, or take the call and let my computer disconnect when the modem times out. The only thing that could be better would be if my computer could answer a call waiting call."
1,Save your money!,"I went out to radio shack today to purchase catch-a-call, all I can say is save your money and don't trust any products that display the logo, ""AS SEEN ON TV"" I followed the instruction and took my time and double checked my connection, and all I got when the unit rang and answer the phone was the sound that a fax machine makes. To me it just was not worth the forty buck's!"
2,Gets the job done for a while,"My wife ordered it for Christmast and I have to say it works great. There was a similar product at BB for almost $100 and she paid less than half. Little or no delay. It is user friendly and I'm grateful for that since the manual is kind of small and lacking.January 2010. It has officially died. Battery is fine on both the transmitter and the headphones, they just won't sync anymore. Customer Service is useless and frustrating. So if you are looking for a temporary set of headphones these are it if you are into throwing $50 at them every 12 to 14 months."
4,not everything is perfect but truth show through,"This movie is based off actual accounts of a fighter pilot death due to wire chaffing, an on going problem in any man made thing. Not all the facts are presented in the movie (hollywood trys to over glorify movies with ""military experts"" who never served a day or lifed the life as a spouse.) Over all a good content, story flow, and for the time raised a few guestions. But also consider this, in the real deal no information is released to public till investagation is done and notification of next kin."
1,a stinker,"I have to blame my brother for even knowing about this movie since he was personally involved in the case. Having heard the actual facts of the case, it was impossible for me to like such a manipulative movie. If I wasn't aware of these facts, I would say it was an average TV movie.For the record, Janet Harduvel lost her case on appeal for those who didn't know."
3,Not as good...,"This soft-cover book is not as good as the original hard-cover, which was (by the way) one of the two books I used to accompany the initial phases of my own T'ai-Chi journey (of 28 years). The photos lack the clarity of the hard cover and the printed instructions are not as clear as in some of the more modern illustrated instruction books. By the way, this latter comment(regarding the printed instructions) also applies to the hard-cover edition as well."
3,Travel to Tibet.,"He was probably the best known broadcaster in the world, and his signature sign off was ""So long, until tomorrow"" being he was a staple in our lives. We could depend on him to take us to places we'd only dreamed of; he was there.In this book, SO LONG UNTIL TOMORROW, Lowell Thomas relates how many years earlier, he was the first American invited to this exquisitely beautiful and special place in what seemed to be a God-forsaken location. He broadcast the first radio show from Potala and Lhasa as his regular ""on the road"" newscast. Getting there was an ordeal because of the terrain; getting back down off these highest mountain ranges in the world was even worse.When the animal carrying him fell, Lowell Thomas suffered broken bones which created severe pain and hhe had to be airlifted out to civilization. It was a major event in his life, and if he were alive, he would surely do it all over again."
4,"Didn't know they did more than just ""High""","I always thought this was a ""one hit wonder"" type band since I hadn't heard of them since the late nineties. Has a nice range of tracks."
5,Loved it!,"Loved this book. Hot & steamy, great story line, great character's. Liked this one a lot better than the first in this series, Brave the Wild Wind, but liked the third, Angel, just as much. Great series all around!"
5,Great author,This is one of my favorite authors. I have recently branched out to a few other authors on Kindle and found out why I really appreciate Johanna Lindsey. She really knows how to tell a story and keep in interesting.
5,savage thunder,"This is a favorite Joanna Lindsey book. It makes you love the characters. You laugh a lot, cry a little, wish they didn't act stupid some of the time and tell each other they are in love at the end. It's a good, fun read."
5,Savage Thunder (Wyoming),All 3 of the Wyoming series from Johanna Lindsey were exciting. Her knowledge of the West during that period of time is amazingly accurate. Her descriptions of the land were beautiful and the love story was beautiful. Johanna Lindsey is an amazing author. I plan to read all her books.
2,Not Impressed,"If you like books where the h/h argue all the time, and the hero avoids the heroine like the plague until 76% completion of the novel, then this is the book for you. To me, it's just way too frustrating."
4,More than just a little in Love with Colt,"I've had this book for years. I have read and re-read it time and again. This is one of my all time favorite books. The pain Colt went through hurts me so much when I read it but in the end he is able to find happiness in the same place where so much sorrow and agony took place. The interactions between Colt, his siblings and other characters that turn up in the book made me laugh, cry, get angry and in the end, I could not wait to go and find the other books with these characters in them."
5,Simply breathtaking.,"This was the first novel I read(at 18)by Johanna Lindsey and that's all it took to get me hooked. This novel was just wonderfully written. I felt so drawn and as if I was a part of this story. I've read the sequels and I must say, she's ruined it for all other romance authors out there!! I'll never go back! I've recommended her to my sister and friends. You are truly the best!!"
4,"Wow, better than some , still not the best.","I did like this book, I finished the book three days after I started it! I thought it was great. But.....I HATED the ending. If you read the book you will understand. I still don't get it. I can come up with half a dozen other endings and that says to me that she could have tried harder. It just left a bad taste.If you are looking for a truly unique book by this author, Please, go check out Warrior's Woman. I LOVED this book."
5,Apoyemos al talento mexicano,"Un disco muy recomendable de quien obtuvo el cuarto lugar en el reality show mexicano ""La academia"" y que sin embargo ha triunfado como ninguno gracias a la pasión que demuestra sobre el escenario, siempre fue mi favorito para ganar el primer lugar y hoy es el único cantante mexicano que realmente merece que lo apoyemos.Una muestra más del talento mexicano."
2,not all that,I saw this guy en La Academia when I was in Mexico and he just exploded.. Honestly I dont see why. His voice is very average in my opinion of course.. and along with his looks. Tiziano Ferro does a much better job than him with the son Alucinando and the rest of the album is just too bland. He's definitly too overrated.
1,Sucks,"This album really sucks, and that's all I got to say about that. Well first of all, the academia wants to pass this guy as a rocker, which he is not, he is straight up pop. Rockers write their own songs, they don't rip off other people's songs."
1,Disapointed,"Yahir has a good voice, but there's nothing original about it. The only good song of the album is ""Alucinado"", which is a cover from a hit by an italian singer. A ver commercial material, but nothing exceptional to music. Let's hope his next album will be better."
1,No me gusto.. I didnt like it...,"A mi no me gusta mucho Yahir pues primero copio lo single ""Alucinado"" de un cantor italiano, Tiziano Ferro (que canta lo tema mucho mejor que Yahir) y tambien me entere que 2 otras canciones de lo cd son copiadas de cantores que todavia no hacen mucho exito pero que estan empienzando. Antes Yahir me encantava pero despues de lo que passo con las ""copias"" de las canciones ... me gusta mucho mas Tiziano Ferro!!!I dont like Yahir because first of all he copied the single ""Alucinado"" from an italian singer, Tiziano Ferro (who sings much better than Yahir) and than now I found out that theis 2 other songs in his cd that are also copied from singers that still doesnt have many sucess but are starting. I used to like Yahir but now with everything thats happening with the ""copies"" of other singers songs .... I started liking Tiziano Ferro!!!"
2,"Informative, but very dull","I have read many many history books in three different languages. This book never got me going. The author knows about her subject, but lacks a persuasive style of writing to keep you focus on the story. Too slow and too much unnessuary details."
1,Awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This stop watch may be ok but the instructions are so awful that I can not figure out how to use it. It is very complicated and doesn't reset according to the instructions. What good is a stop watch that does not reset??????
5,"Old, but great info","This book is a fantastic resource for much information about our canine friends. From feeding your dog, his anatomy, whelping, care of puppies, sale of dogs and dog showing, this book has just about everything you need to know. 12,000 copies of this 6th edition were printed in 1947."
5,Perfect replacement,After our shelves cracked after 15 years we ordered these and they were an exact fit. Just removed the screws and easily installed these as all the holes lined up same as the old one.
4,"Perfect fit, instructions would have helped","One shelf on my lazy-susan broke and needed to be replaced. This product was a perfect fit and seems to be sturdier than the original. I wish it had come with installation instructions, but I found them on the manufacturers web site. I was a bit intimidated when I realized how much was involved in replacing this (you have to take the entire unit out of the cabinet, slide the old shelf off, slide the new one on and then put it back and adjust it), but it wasn't difficult and I completed the project in under an hour (I'm a VERY amateur do-it-yourselfer). It was well worth my time, when you consider what a professional would have charged me to do the work."
4,Great Purchase,"This product works wonderfully in my cabinet. The only problem I experienced was with the installation. No instructions were included so I was forced to ""wing it"". I had to take the entire cabinet apart in order to complete the installation. Even though it was very complicated to put in, the shelf is very sturdy and I am happy with my purchase."
4,Good Product - Great Service,"I originally received this product from my dentist who was running a ""Free whitening"" special for new patients. However, I only got two syringes of the gel and it was gone before I got the results I wanted. When I inquired about purchasing more from my dentist, I was quoted $55 for two more syringes. I then shopped on-line and found that I could get three syringes of the exact same product for $28 including shipping. I ordered it (through AplusSmile) and it arrived in two days, which exceeded my expectations."
3,stephen jones is now cured of sadness,"Stephen Jones, ex founder-leader of the english band Babybird (which had two big hits in 1996, ""You're Gorgeous"" and ""Candy Girl""), left the band in 2000, 3 months later the release of their last album ""Bugged"", because, on his opinion,nobody was interested in BabyBird anymore. After a break of one year spent between a side project (a book released in summer 2001), he's now back as a solo artist, always with the same humor-sarcasm of the Babybird days. He released a collection of instrumental songs ""dedicated for movie soundtracks ONLY"" in the late 2001, entitled ""1985-2001"", and now, his first solo + singed album, ""Almost Cured Of Sadness"". The genious of this artist is remarkable in every song, every lyric. An incredible and talented artist, probably too much underrated. Is he now cured of sadness? who knows? we just know that this new album is similar to his Babybird works, and this is enough to say: ""another great work"""
2,an uncertain step in a new direction?,"I loved just about everything Stephen Jones did as Babybird, but this album leaves me cold. It's like an aural collage (with samples galore) layered with sometimes nasally child-like vocals over hip-hoppish beats. Not all tracks follow that formula but it's the general rule of the album. My musical tastes actually veer towards the experimental side of things - (I'm really not a huge pop fan - Babybird was a notable exception), but ""Almost Cured of Sadness"" simply isn't focused enough to work."
5,Top 5 On TV,"This is one show, that if chosen to pick a show to watch until the end of the universe, would be my pick. This is just one of many amazing HBO shows and totally recommend it."
5,Season one is better than season two,"First of all this is much better when you are an altered state of mind it just makes the jokes so much better. Tim is the perfect everyman he is a working guy who has a corporate gig and finds himself in trouble in every episode to no fault of his own. His choices are always wrong and he ends up paying a dear price for these errors in judgement. Wheter he is helping a hooker or lying for a buddy he is sure to anger his girlfriend and her parents. The episodes of Tim center around his work, the local bar or his apartment so they never seem to get stale. There is a comparison to Beavis and Butthead but that is not true Tim is on not crude or crass at all I see more of a comparison to Roseanne this is a hard working guy who has a normal life and he just always seem to get himself in trouble.In my opinion there is nothing as fresh and funny as The Life and Times of Tim."
1,Did not work,"This device works on a fairly simple principle and should work just fine. However, carefully following the included instructions resulted in three separate circuits being indicated as the proper circuit; NONE of them turned off the power where I needed to work.I finally used the flip and check method to find the correct circuit breaker and it was one that the device hadn't even peeped at, though I'd been over it multiple times."
4,At least it narrows it down to two quickly.,"Which sure beats flipping through the entire circuit panel.No, it isn't perfect or fool proof, but I think it's an ingeniously simple invention that makes figuring out which circuit breaker controls that plug a one or two minute minor event, not an extended ordeal. It works."
2,Narrows down the choices only slightly,The problem I have with this device is that maybe too sensitive. It goes sounds the alarm on any breaker on the same side of the panel as THE breaker.It makes it all too easy to turn off the wrong breaker so it is not to be trusted.Or maybe it just does not work with the SquareD breakers I have.2 stars for narrowing the choices down to the side of the box.
1,Don't bother!!!,I just purchased this item and within one hour it says that I have walked 1000 steps. I am a teacher but I know that I could not have walked that many. VERY INACCURATE!!!!!! Look into others!
3,Death to the battery.,My sportline-342 arrived promptly and well packaged. I managed to get 26 steps (I counted them) before the meter quit. I took out the battery - it was corroded and did not measure anything on my battery tester. I will try to find a replacement battery. This meter seems simple to work with. I'll keep you posted!
4,"Over-the-top, but nice","This is a nice case. The fit/finish is excellent. The leather, zipper and pulls are all above-average quality. The perforated exterior looks cool. It is pricey, though. However, given the cost of a TX VAIO, this is definitely a justifiable purchase."
2,Less then pleased,"This product is badly overpriced. I would have thought for $120, this tiny cse with it's tiny amount of leather should have had hard sides to protect the delicate laptop it's intended to protect. On the positive side, it's well made and does offer some measure of protection, just not s much as I would have liked."
4,Buzzin!!!,"This album is alot better than the first clubland, it has better songs and has songs which i haven't heard in a while. It has face down ... up which is a class song! and has other songs from happy hardcore like children of the night. You should definately buy this album!!! its buzzzzzzziiiinnnnn!!!!!"
1,This book WILL NOT prepare you for the exam,"If I could, I'd give this a negative 5 stars. In no conceivable way will this book prepare you for the CEDIA Level 1 exam. You are much better off reading straight out of the NEC materials. The sample questions are puff balls compared to the real exam. How can publishers get away with putting out such garbage??? This book has more value as a presto log."
3,Good place to start but not a great exam guide,I thought this book was very thorough and is full of good information but you cannot rely on this for a one stop shop to study for the exam. Just use this as one of your study guides and as a reference. I read this book inside and out and even had quite a bit of experience in the industry before taking the Cedia Installer I exam and still could not pass. I can't even begin to tell you how many questions were on the exam but that were not covered in this book.
3,Picture & description don't match...,"I purchased a new electric shaver and I added this pre-electric lotion, thinking that it is what it says... Sadly, when I received the product, instead of the pre-shave lotion, I got the after shave lotion... As I look at the picture now, I see the picture shows the after shave lotion, but the description and all reviews are for the pre-shave lotion, so there is a big disconnect here... I'm hesitant to buy another ""pre-electric"" lotion, who knows what they ship me..."
5,Great Pre-Electric Product,"I buy this for my husband because the local stores stopped carrying it. This makes his shaving experience that much more enjoyable due to this high quality product. I dislike having to pay for shipping but since I can't get it local, don't have much choice. The price is not bad if you are buying packs of two, quite reasonable actually. If you are looking for an excellent pre-electric cream to use before you shave, we highly recommend this product!"
3,"Does the job well, if you can stand the smell","I had bought a store brand of this item from CVS, but I wanted to try this because it was a better price for the two-pack, and I assumed it would have the same fragrance as the store brand. I've decided that cassava flour-based pre-shave lotions are the best choice for me. For my beard, the alcohol in this stuff tightens up my skin, but once it dries, the cassava flour leaves my skin very smooth and the razor just glides right over my face. There's no doubt in my mind I'm getting a better, closer shave.The problem, however, is the fragrance. It's very spicy, with a heavy clove scent, and it lingers long after I have shaved. I can't tell if it's like Old Spice, but it's how I imagine Old Spice would smell. It's really overpowering.I'm going back to the CVS-branded pre-shave lotion. It works just as well, and smells far better in my (and my wife's) opinion."
2,too dry,This product dries out so you have to keep splashing water on it. That way my electric razor can glide on my face. who wants a bumpy ride.
1,Mennens Pre electric,"I have not received this product which was due about a week ago according to your advice,Please advise.................Laurie Middleweek"
1,wrong item sent,"My husband would love to comment on the pre-electric, but we received after shave instead and it is not worth the hassle to return it and try again."
1,very strong pungent odor,I stopped using after once because the smell is sooo strong and pungent.seemed to work ok on first shave interms of increasing the hair grasp and cutthe smell is soo strong (similar to classic old spice but 1000 times stronger) it lasted on shaver even after washing it three times with soap for almost a week
4,Good,"Pretty good pre save cream, have tried different brands and this is one of the better ones I believe. Would buy again"
3,Pre shave lotion for electric shaver,"Last year I acquired an Arcitec electric shaver from Norelco to replace my previous Norelco. I found I suddenly absolutely had to use a pre shave with this new shaver. To me, the regular Williams Lectric pre shave is too messy, although it works well. I did like, and used, their gel lotion but they apparently stopped manufacturing it. The Afta product is my fallback solution. It works, isn't as messy as the regular Williams, but it smells awful to me - kind of like the barbershops of the 50's, as I remember them."
5,"Jim Nabors, His Dreamy Voice","I now own all of Jim Nabors' CD's. I could listen to his singing 24/7. His voice is so pure and he enunciates so well, I can hear every word he sings. Thank you Jim Nabors for sharing your gift from God with the world, and especially me. ""DREAMING OF A WHITE CHRISTMAS"" by Jim Nabors is one of his best. The recordings are so clear, as if he were singing in the same room as I am sitting.Anyone who loves to listen to a great voice, plus songs we all love to hear, buy one or all today."
1,This book contains NO information on UNIX at all!.,"Based on the previous review, I bought this book for a large UNIX project I am working on. I wonder if my friend from Egypt even read this book? This is a great COBOL reference though."
4,The Band plays on...and you should be listening.,"I've had a couple of friends who ended up getting into The Band because of this boxset. It might not have ""everything"" a diehard could hope for, but it's more than a satisfactory offering for a newcomer IMO. I'll dock it one star for some of the ""un-rare rarities"" on disc 3, but that shouldn't have much bearing on the average listener. If you haven't heard much from The Band, this boxset is a good starting point. By the end of the third disc, part of you will feel like you've known 'em all along...like others have said, ""Americana"" indeed. Highly recommended."
2,A pretty puzzle with problems,"The best thing about this puzzle is the picture - nice colors and lots of little details. And there were no missing pieces. Unfortunately, it isn't very well-made. The picture layer isn't glued down very securely, and some of the ""knobs"" are barely connected to the pieces. In fact, when I took the puzzle down, one of the knobs came off. Some of the pieces weren't cut all the way through - a not uncommon jigsaw problem. I took a chance on this puzzle because I liked the picture, and the price is good. But I guess - like almost everything in life - you get what you pay for."
3,Graphics don't do justice do XBox,"This game plays like any other skating/snowboarding game, so if you like that genre, you will like this game. However, the graphics are lame compared to other XBox titles. Looks like they dumbed down the graphics to make the port to PlayStation2 easier. It looks like sticking with XBox exclusive titles might be a wise choice, as those are the games with the best graphics."
3,Perplexing?!,"I give Dark Summit 3 stars. I wouldn't say it was the best game ever. The story line and acting was good if you like real cocky anime.At the beginning you only get to play with one character. You'll have to literally beat the game to unlock the rest of the characters. One thing that was perplexing to me is why would you want to play with the rest of the characters and beat the game, and you already beat it with the first? It takes all the fun out the game itself.I did,however, give it 3 stars because of the challenge it brought.P.S. Please! Rent the game before buying. I was stupid enough to buy it. You don't be stupid and rent it first."
3,Doesnt match up to ssx tricky,This game is very enjoyable but it doesnt match up to ssx. this game is great but my advice is to skip this and buy ssx tricky which is the best snowboarding game.
1,"It's okay, but with Amped on the XBOX why bother?","I saw this game at the store for a few bucks and thought ""why not?"" Well even though it was just a few bucks, I expect a game to be fun and worth my time. This game wasn't. After playing snowboarding games like ""Amped"" and ""Amped 2"", this game seems really boring. It's that simple. It just isn't any fun. The graphics are mediocre. The storyline seemed to be just tossed in there to add some color. It didn't ""draw me in"" at all. So here's the breakdown: poor graphics, terrible gameplay, and if you're looking for a snowboarding game, get Amped."
3,A different kind of game (that actually works),"Dark Summit is not quite what I was expecting as the third choice of an xbox package deal. I thought that I would be performing tricks and racing down a hill over and over which is fun if the eye candy is good enough. Luckily, I was wrong. The game has a decent storyline and keeps you doing new things and trying out new tricks. A solid game. The only issue I have with it is that the multiplayer doesn't let you have a trick competition, just racing and demolition."
1,Not really a snowboarding game,"The story line is kinda lame and the majority of the ""action"" doesn't really relate. I like Tricky SSX much better."
1,Devoid of any useful content,"I read this book hoping to find some help on a variety of Nt issues ranging from scripting to hardware installation. The book talks at great length about how neat Nt is, but gives little useful information on using or configuring Nt."
2,A bulky and not very useful guide to NT,"I was quite disappointed in this book. Peter Norton has a credit as an author, but I doubt that he had anything to do with creating it other than lending his name.The authors wrote to fill pages rather than provide substantive, meaningful information. It's a rehash of a Windows NT 3.5 version without new screen shots for NT 4.0. A clear example of where a big book is not better.I really felt that I had wasted my money at a time that I could not afford to. Since then I've bought ""Windows NT At a Glance"", published by Microsoft Press and have been much happier with that."
1,too complex for freshers,"i made a mistake by buying this book. too complex for starters. nothing is explained in detail. More description is given on the networking concepts than on the OS(WIN NT4). i would not recommend this book to anybody, there are better books on NT4."
2,This book is not that useful,This book is on the surface. It is unlikely that you would find something in this book when you are faced with a real life situation
3,"Not quite what I thought, but still interesting","Describes events leading up to the sessions, and backgrounds of the musicians more than the actual recording sessions."
3,Long term experience of a Vaio,"I have two of the previous model of the Vaio. I really like the small form factor and the feel of it. I have the Z505 series which has an external DVD that plugs into the PCMCIA which is a real drag when you use 802.11b networking.After 2 years the machine has held up OK with a couple of major issues. First the power supply connector is highly proprietary and subject to the little plastic insert snapping. This would not be a problem if Sony would sell me a replacement connector, they want (money) for a repair person to fix it.The other problem is that the batteries do seem to go soft after a while. My extended life LiIon battery dropped to giving me muinites of battery time.All in all par for the course with Laptops I suppose. I have had no better experience reliability wise with any other brand. 2 years appears to be the limit."
1,"SONY is sooo bad, why is anyone buing them??","I have a sony pcg-fx300p, I have had problems with this laptop since the first day I opened the box. You should also know that I have previously bought two (2) other computers from sony. Well my experience with Sony is that their products are only and nothing else but complete fluff. They brake, they malfunction, the support is terrible, yes they are nice on the telephone and will send you a box just like IBM, but their tech department will return the machine to you with no corrections but a mere reinstalation of the OS.Anyone reading this, don't buy sonY, it stucks.My laptop is under warantee, I have had the product repaired twice, of course I have't been able to obtain an exchange machine.Please don't buy Sony if you cherish your time and money."
2,Pilot Chrono watch disappointing,"Due to no fault of the manufacturer, this watch is too bulky for me and not comfortable. Also, many of the ""apparent"" features are just that, apparent and non-functional. This purchase was a mistake but the fault is mine."
4,"Excellent crepe recipes, fillings leave a little to be desired",The introduction to this book and the basic recipes for crepes are well worth its price. The crepes turn out tender and flavorful every time. One of my new favorites for savory crepes is the Garbanzo Flour Crepe recipe. Another excellent feature is that Seibert-Pappas gives useful information on how to fold and store crepes.One drawback to this book is that Ricotta cheese is used as a filler in virtually all of the savory crepe recipes. This can be a problem if you do not like ricotta cheese or if you do not like it when it is combined with certain foods (e.g. seafood). The recipes for dessert crepes are more varied.
2,Crepe Book Almost Useless,"I was disappointed with the book because it is not for the average cook. Too many of the recipes have unusual ingredients, and they are not satisfactory for my needs. I give the book a 2 rating, although I'm sure that more adventuresome cooks might find it excellent."
5,GREAT!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas along with a crepe maker. We've used it THREE times since Christmas...three different recipes in three days and each has been DELICIOUS! Great pictures...wonderful recipes and tips!
3,A good thriller,"Set during World War II in Poland and in Paris. Three very different men, all Wermacht generals, are under suspicion for the murder of a Polish prostitute.Kirst is a witty and insightful writer. This book is not his best but is still worth reading."
5,Excellent Book full of great ideas!!,"This is a terrific resource for those who are in charge of the home. Kathy Peel has great ideas and suggestions for home management including finances, cooking, entertaining, home organization. This is not one of those home organization books whose suggestions are so detailed that the average person would never follow through with them! It is great!"
4,Left me wanting...,"There are some wonderful moments on this cd when the music and lyrics spark, like flashes of lightning in a cold night's storm. I find myself listening to the music, waiting for the brilliant flashes. This music is good, but not great. It leaves me wanting something more and sends me searching through stacks of cd's for Summerteeth, or maybe something by the Sundays."
1,PAINFULLY...SLOW...SHIPPING...,I placed my order on May 20th and it took them until June 8th to get it in UPS ground. 19 DAYS. And even with that lag it'll still be a few more until it reaches me. The local custom made places said they'd have it done in 3 weeks. NO EXCUSE for this vendor to take so long with something prefab.I'll update this review when/if I ever get the thing but for now I would not recommend buying from this seller if for no other reason than I could have gotten it by now anywhere else. They were very slow to respond to emails and their turnaround time was unacceptable.
1,V FOR VICTORY FALLS TO GRIM DEFEAT,"This book is remarkably full of errors. Multiple prices for the same item are listed in different locations. Items are completely mislabelled with regard to what they are made of or what they are. When comparing prices in this guide with his other homefront guide the prices for many items are completely different reflecting this authors failure to be consistent and to proofread his work. Were it not for the pics sent by the collectors, this book would have zero utility. The pics are good thanks to his contributors but the rest of the guide for accuracy and integrity is sorely lacking. Give it a one star because of the pics. I'd pass on this sloppy work..."
1,"Great Story, Boring Movie","I purchased this movie for our Sunday wee church (preschool age) kids to watch for Easter. I absolutely love this story, and was anxious to show it to the kids in a ""multi-media"" format.Unfortanately, this movie was a disapointment. 30 minutes to tell such a short story leads to a movie that is slow moving and boring. I showed it to a group of 2nd and 3rd graders this past Sunday, and I don't think they'll forgive me for it any time soon. They were bored silly, and therefore missed the entire point the movie made. I know my own kindergarten daughter would not watch it because it's so slow moving.I'm considering this purchase a flop and will hide the video in my office."
4,Inspiration!,"This book is sooo great- if you haven't got it get it! It is so good for strenthening you relationship with Christ.There are so many safe ways to stand up, without dying for it- these people went so far as to die for Christ. Would you?"
3,"a well-intended, great book with a great flaw","I would have nothing but praise for this book if it weren't for the painfully obvious anti-Catholic elements. (although they officially claim to be inter-denominational) To reiterate the point made by several other reviewers, there are some very obvious martyrs missing in the book (St. Thomas More, Maximilian Kolbe) and it antagonizes the Catholic Church. 'Their stories must be told', yes, I agree, it opened my eyes and I absolutely love everythihg else about the book. couldn' there have been less of a bias so to make it open for believers of all denominations? (not that I classify the RCC as another denomination)"
5,"Wow. The blunt, raw, stories of radical Christians.","Having a hard time standing for Jesus because you have no friends standing with you? Read this book, and be encouraged! This book is a collection of stories of Christians that were tortured and killed for their faith. These people were radicals, revolutionaries, and world changers. Read this book, you won't be disappointed."
4,"a good read, informative","I found this to be an easy and interesting read. The book contains stories of Christian martyrs from biblical times to modern day, as well as a section about Christian persecution in other countries, and what we can do. I found it to be someone one sided, more of a Protestant book, as other Christian sects, Catholicism &Orthodoxy didnt really get much of a say in this book. The information in the book was very helpful, and lets one see that Christians arent always the ones persecuting. In other countries where Christians are the minority, we get more than our share of ridicule."
5,"Oh, my, GOODNESS!!","If this book doesn't change your views on life, and the way you live your faith, I don't know what will!! This book is so powerful, it will lift you out of your ""comfort zone"". My father doesn't read many books and especially if they're big, but when I bought it, he was the first to read it and because he recommended it so strongly, Iwill do the same. Read it!! Your life will never be the same!!"
5,Totally awesome Book,This book was a definate eye-opener and caused me to step back and look at how I was doing in my relationship with Christ. Anyone considering buying this book should wait no longer!
5,Challenging,"I received this book as a free gift for attending YC2K in April. I started reading 2 or 3 stories from it every nite and found that I usually could not stop after only reading 2 or 3, soon it became 8 or 10 every day. I went thru the book very quickly and thouroughly enjoyed it. I felt challenged as a Christian in my faith, and often found myself putting myself into the people's situations, trying to decide if I could stand for my faith to the point of death. It strengthened my faith, and challenged me not to be discouraged by persecution."
5,Those who found something worth dying for,"WOW! Like the other reviewer, I first got this book because it's by my favorite Christian group. But soon, I realized how inspiring and encouraging this book is and how it challenges all of us to be bold about Christ, no matter what the cost! What really touched me was those who were told things like ""your child will be killed if you don't refuse Christ"" and yet they were still able to be bold for Jesus, even if it meant their own child or loved one being killed. How many of us could do that?! This is an outstanding book and it's a tribute to those who found something worth dying for. If you don't find something worth dying for, then you're not really living."
4,"inspiring, heartfelt stories...","would what you do for your faith? how much would you be willing to lose for your belief in Jesus? would you be willing to die to pronounce your beliefs? this book is filled with incredible stories about people who risked everything with calm and peace in their hearts and souls to pronounce their love of our Savior. Inspiring and an eye opener to horrific challenges Christians face in speaking their beliefs in certain parts of the world. Not a book to sit down and read straight through but to savor, maybe a story here, a story tomorrow. Feeling a bit insecure or persecuted about your faith? Sit down and read a few stories and you will be invigorated."
5,The Best Book,I have been thinking about my life and what else could I give to the Lord. I saw this book and purchased it. It is the best book I've read in a long time. It made me cry to think that these people gave their lives for Christ. It should have a sequel. I tell everyone about it.
5,Awesome!!,If you area a Jesus Freak this is a must have!! I have read it and read it. YOu must get this book!! There are great true stories in it dating from bible times up to present day. I highly reccomend it!!
3,Martyrdom lives on,"This book of martyrdom is primarily focused on modern day events. The length of each excerpt didn't provide enough history of the subjects for my taste, but may be well suited for young adults or others that have little patience for literature. The real value of this book is the light it sheds on the continuing martyrdom of Christians even in the now ""civilized"" world."
4,Chandler is back,"It's an ok show if you like friends. They get Matthew perry to play his same character, get a Monica-esque group leader, and fill out the rest of the cast with generic stereotypes. All in all a pretty funny but predictable show if you are a fan if sarcastic humor."
2,Go On Season 1 (HD),I believe this was a pilot for the TV show. I was not so thrilled with it and haven't watched the show either.
5,A nice start,"At first I was not sure about the show but when I saw the pilot everything changed.Matthew Perry done the part well, I hope for more episodes to come."
2,you might need to laugh after you watch it,"I was really rooting for Matthew Perry to have a winning, funny show. I just felt his character was uninteresting and lame. Going into a grief therapy session and getting the ""kooky"" participants to compete for who has the saddest story could have been funny if anything about it was well-done. His little Fruit-throwing tantrum to prove he actually is affected by his wife's death also wasn't funny. (But I guess we all laugh at different things.)No depth, no wit, no real characters. Nothing to recommend."
1,Desparately trying to be funny,"You think of Matthew Perry and you think of a fast paced witty TV episodes. Friends, Studio60 and even the odd stint on the West Wing are all great vehicles for his talent. If you are expecting GoOn to be added to that list, then move on.With a 'One Flew over the Cuckoos nest' premise Perry is in a support help group of misfits whom he plays off of for comedic effect. Falls completely flat. Not even remotely funny.Fortunately Amazon Prime gave it away for free but the pilot has done nothing to have me tune in to the season."
3,Go On- pilot - where's the meat?,"This show looks like it has all the right stuff. Stars, plot, good production value...etc. Everything except content. Often pilots are the best show of the first season. If that is the case this show will run out of gas by episode 2.5...."
5,This book changed my life!!,"I have tried all kinds of health books to try and lose weight and to reduce the symptoms of my allergies. Since following the detox program in this book I have lost weight and my sinus congestion has cleared completely. I'm so amazed.Additionally, I have so much more energy that I don't feel sleepy during the day and I haven't had any sugar cravings for weeks.You have to get this book and do the detox - I urge you!"
3,PS very noisy,"My only dissappointment about this PS came when I started running memory intensive applications. The fan picked up speed and makes a loud noise. It comes down once you close the application, and it happens even if I open 5 websites in different IE tabs."
2,Not only good looking,"Sino ke tambien trabaja como campeona! esta fuente es todo lo ke necesito para potenciar mi PC (C2D4400, 2GB DDR2-800, 250GB SATA2, 7600GT) ademas el acabado cromado reduce la estatica."
2,Totally deceptive color,"The phone itself is fine. It's a basic corded phone that is wall or desk mountable (though to mount on the wall, you need to pull out a little tab and reinsert it upside down so that the receiver catches on it and stays on the wall).Unfortunately, I ordered this phone in red after seeing the photo on Amazon, and it is totally inaccurate! The picture appears to be a bright, vibrant red, but in reality, the color is more like a drab maroon. It doesn't go with my decor at all. The shipping ended up costing me more than the phone itself, so I'm not going to return it, but will instead pony up a few more dollars and buy a black replacement. Hopefully that won't end up being gray or something...."
1,Never Received a Return Call,"I ordered the phone and was very happy with the color and the size and everything about it! But, it only worked for one day?? Then I tried to contact EVERYBODY to get a replacement and no one returned my call? I paid more for shipping then for the phone so I won't be returning it."
2,Same as ordinary York Notes!,"This book is misleadingly titled. It is exactly the same text as the previous York Notes on The Waste Land, and so is not in any way 'Advanced'."
1,"Garbage in, garbage out","This book came from Dylan's garbage and that's what it is...just a lot of words ""interpreted"" by this man who has neverhad a conversation with his subject. He has traded on Dylanfor years and has nothing NOTHING to contribute to any understanding of Bob Dylan. Listen to Dylan's work yourselfand/or read real books about the man if you want to acquiresome understanding of this artist.Whatever you paid for this book.....you were robbed!"
1,Why the dye?,"There is no reason for the manufacturer to put red food coloring into this mix. There are numerous concerns about the effect on hummingbirds. This is reason enough to not buy this product. Buy a product without the dye.Better yet, just buy sugar. Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar. Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved. You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food. Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.CAUTION. DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey, use only sugar. Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds. Sugar Only!"
1,A waste of money,"Humming birds had been feeding throughout the day at my feeders. For convenience, I bought some of this mix. The birds stopped feeding as soon as I used this product. I mixed another batch, thinking that I had made a mistake somehow. They still won't feed. I have gone back to making my own, much cheaper and no additives. In addition, the bags had leaked inside the package, making a mess."
1,Hummers prefer real sugar water!,"I got this as a gift and tried it because I didn't have to boil water and the package said the dye was safe for hummingbirds. Unfortunately the hummers didn't care for this stuff at all! I left it out for 2 weeks and the birds disappeared! Once I went back to making my own sugar water, the hummers were back to their daily multiple visits. Spending 5 minutes to make your own sugar water is well worth it!"
1,Unfit for human consumption--save the birds,"Others have written here, and experts tend to agree, that red coloring is totally unnecessary in hummingbird feeders. After using this junk without many of the delightful little critters drinking from it, I switched to one cup of sugar in 2 cups of boiling water, then letting it cool (of course). I'm having to refill it every day now, with such a variety arriving to sip the nectar."
5,Great Experience,The hummingbird seem to love the stuff. Makes for a very enjoyable view. Highly recommended!
5,Individual Packets a plus!,"I love this product because the food comes in individual packages, just the right size per filling. No more worries about finding a way to secure the rest of the product when packaged in one bag. Just open, pour and another package awaits when you next need to fill you bird feeder. Excellent!"
2,Our hummingbirds didn't care for this,I used a clean feeder and followed directions. The birds stopped by and kept going. The ants sure liked it though.
1,horrible item,"I used to get 3-4 hummingbirds a day with regular sugar water. Since I put this solution on, I got 1-2 every other day. 2 weeks later no birds."
3,it has worked for 10 years,"IT is an education to see these posts and learn that red dye MIGHT be bad for hummingbirds - however - I've used this exact mix for over a decade with no problems attracting, keeping, and seemingly pleasing many many hummingbirds. If you mix it weak, it won't work. If you mix it right, they will come. And fight over it. I sympathize with people who want to keep toxins out of wild animals, but really?? In Houston, there's more toxins in the air than any dye. If these birds can survive the toxic sludge that is houston water and air, I think they'll survive a lil red dye."
2,Where are the hummingbirds?,"Not sure about this product. I've got hummingbirds all over my neighborhood, but they don't seem to like this stuff... I'm almost ready to just do some red-food-coloring and sugar water. If it works, I'll post another review."
1,WATCH OUT ! RED DYE IS BAD for HUMMINGBIRDS !!,"Do NOT FEED Hummingbirds any mixture or concoction with RED DYE in it ! IT'S VERY HARMFUL to them !! The same red dye (Red Dye #40) has been proven harmful to humans.If you feed hummingbirds, there are many simple 2-ingredient (sugar and water ) ""recipes"" online. Very simple and very inexpensive !!Come on Perky Pet - you make so many good products - this PRODUCT is WAY BELOW YOUR STANDARDS. There are many safe natural red dyes - although, if the plastic feeder tube is red, who needs RED DYE at all? The whole idea is just to attract their attention to the feeder initially. They DO NOT PREFER sugar water with red dye !!! Red Dye # 40 IS HARMFUL !!!!"
4,Hummingbirds Like It,I have used these packets for years. I think that they are great. The hummingbirds are always at the feeder. I had a hard time finding them at the pet store that I used to buy them at so I looked online and found them there. I was happy to see them here. I will keep on buying the Perky Pet Hummingbird nectar.
3,"Service, not product","It was difficult to determine the quality of the product because the individual bags were packaged so tightly that they broke and began to spill their contents, which I blame on the company. As far as I can tell, the ""nectar"" produced is just fine."
3,DONT COMPARE...,"This is not on the same level as 'White Oleander', it's a quick, light book, pretty good story. There isnt as much of the author's unique, poetic, metaphors etc. like in her other books, but the plot of this book is simple and nice."
5,One of History's Great Women,"Whether your interest is women scholars or female scientists in antiquity, Christian history or pagan philosophy, this book is a major eye-opener. Hypatia--and all her female colleagues--deserve to be remembered, and Dzielska deserves credit for helping preserve their story."
4,Hypatia of Alexandria,Very scholarly. Also written very well. It cuts through the centuries of distortion. An excellent study!
1,awful,"This is probably the most boring book I have ever read. If you want a book that is a bunch of random facts about people other than Hypatia, buy this book. Soooooo boring. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
1,This is the most disturbing children's book ever!,"Judging by the other reviews here for this book, I must be one of the only ones that absolutely hated this book. I found the whole idea behind the story to be completely disturbing, especially when the book is geared at preschool age children. The fact that book goes as far as to say at the end when the mother reunites her son's newly found lost pumpkin head with the body they had kept in a ""cool dry place"". I'm sorry, but that's just creepy. I will say that the rhyming nature of the book was fun and enjoyable, but the storyline itself was just horrid. JMO"
5,More than just a story....a life lesson for children,"This book, to me, is phenomenal. It is about a boy with a pumpkin for a head, and the misfortune that he endures, and at the end, simply relays that misforture may always happen, and that its part of life. It's a simple truth. We all have a pumpkin...a flaw or a problem, and that's life. I think its important to help children understand this...because stories too often have happy-go-lucky endings that we cannot live up to. It's a great book for professionals who work with children on a daily basis, and for parents to read to their kids as well."
3,More form than content,"This book is a beautiful little package, wonderfully chunky, with a die-cut window in the front cover that reveals a picture of the title character. The illustrations are whimsical and bold, the typefaces harmonize with the whole look of the book. It's a well-designed book; very complete and pleasing in that regard.The story, however, isn't much. A normal couple has a child with a pumpkin for a head. They don't find this unusual. One day, the boy loses his head, and eventually his mother finds it via happenstance. The end. No message, no subtext. Not even any particularly enjoyable language. The story couldn't even be called ""cute.""I was tempted to hold onto my review copy, though. The illustrations and overall book design are that good. Fans of printmaking and fledgling book-design geeks might take a shine to this book. I don't see it hanging in there as a storybook or even a novelty book for Halloween, though."
5,The Hotter the Better,"Have been following rock music since 1968 when I bought my first Deep Purple Album and have left no stone unturned. This is probably one of the best albums I have heard in the second quarter of this year. Got to know of it through the Need for Speed 2 Computer Game which i loved playing especially when the Fever for the Flava song came on. The band is tight, the lyrics are 'hot' and the Flava is great. Its a great debut and look forward to their follow up. I only hope that this band does not join the annals of one hit wonders. Look out for great riffs on Goin down on it and a ballad on busted. The Fever for the Flava is riveting. The video is smoking, but remember to download quicktime for the enhanced capabilities."
3,Average,Im gonna have to give this cd 3 stars.Because it's just too freakin' perverted!.Maybe if they just turned it down just a knoch maybe id give it 5 stars.
1,"Jesus, this is bad.","Yet another radio ""hardcore"" band cashes in on the rap rock, and the outcome is just as bad as before. Listening to this album is like a trainwreck involving limp bizkit, bad korn bass riffs, and any other trendy garbage one finds in this genre. Another reviewer wrote ""pure genius"" or something to that affect, I stared blankly at my computer and muttered ""there is no hope left for humanity"", this album is manufactured at best and will not be remembered 5 years from now."
1,Dont waste your money,Dont waste yor money or time buying or listening to this. Its coporate garbage and sounds nothing like the Chili peppers. The guy who rated this 5 stars either is in the band or works for the label.
4,Judge It By Its Cover,"Nice Cover. And several nice songs on this title. I've really liked ""Fever for the Flava"" and ""Goin' Down On It"" for months when they were used in the PlayStation's newest Need for Speed game. And having waited so long for the actual CD to be released, I guess I'm pretty happy with the down-and-DIRTY versions of the music.I just wished the lyrics were obtainable from somewhere."
4,Where do these guys get their inspiration?,"When I heard ""Fever for the flava"" on the radio I thought..this group has energy. I bought the album and realized that although it's not all as energetic as their first radio release, it is a great cd never-the-less. It reminds me of old school Red Hot Chili Peppers but not as polished. You know the good'o Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic days. Hey, the rough edges are what I like. Whether or not their the next R.H.C.P or not, I like their music. Maybe the only thing these two groups have in common is that they both have ""HOT"" in their names. WHO CARES?"
1,horrible,"I borrowed this cd from a friend with a complete open mind. I had never heard of them and always like to hear new music. I listened to the entire cd once and that was once to much. The lyrics and music are terrible. Their sound is a cross between a generic limp bizkit and sugar ray. Both bands are generic now anyway. The lyrics are pointless, and range from eating crotch to retarded sappy lines about nothing. There is nothing good about the cd. The music is just as awful. Recycled nu metal riffs with generic break downs. If you buy this you will kick yourself in about 2 days, and promptly leave the cd at the bottom of your cd pile. Horrible"
5,This is a MUST have.,"Rock, rap, metal... I not sure what they call it. It is a great CD. I have friends from all social, economic, race, sex, creade, national origins, and if they don't freakin like t they can get out."
4,Hot CD,"Heard in the real cancun movie, (which is hot) and they were pretty good so I pick up the CD and it is decent."
2,not worth the time,"This book describes the physiological aspects of memory. However, it does it in a fairly scatterbrained way without continuity between chapters. Also, the information is fairly anecdotal and the science is ""dumbed down"" significantly. If you're interested in the physiological basis for memory, there are much better books than this. Also, if you're interested in ways to improve your memory (as I was), this is not the book for you."
5,My first review...,"I've never bothered to review a book on Amazon before, but I truly enjoyed this book and wanted to say so. Rupp's exploration of memory is delightful reading and thoroughly informative, and I loved the quotes she uses liberally throughout. Just a great book on a huge subject."
4,500 Thread Count Egyptian Coton Pillow Cases,"These are wonderful pillow cases. They are thick, soft and feel wonderful when your face hits the pillow. I wanted a little smaller standard pillow size since this is really like a queen. But I have no complaint with the quality of the cases."
3,the missing mercury,"the book claims to cover every Merc outboard model, including, I thought, the 1960 300 series. Not so good.The book didn't even mention the lower unit, water pump and other aspects I needed. Overall, a nice book, but not nearly complete."
3,good for ordinary use,"I bought this type laptop two months ago, most time it works good, but I found it has a very annoyed problem. If you watch DVD or listen to music and use Internet at the same time, internet can be very often disconnected automatically, sometime, machine even crashes. Actually I changed my machine, but this second machine has the same problem."
1,THIS SUX,"This sux!!! He is a horrible man... He is horrible to family.. DOnt buy this!!!!!!LOVE ALWAYS,His daughter EDEN"
4,"Funny, helpful, inexpensive handbook!","Having been recently engaged, my wife-to-be was off purchasing guides and magazine subscriptions and handbooks for her maid of honor and other bridesmaids. This seemed totally appropriate for her, but when she asked me if I would be purchasing anything like that for my groomsmen, I declined. What could I possibly buy my groomsmen that they wouldn't laugh at or just throw to the side until the wedding is over?This guide proved to be just the thing. At a great price on Amazon.com, and after reviewing some of the pages using their ""Inside the Cover"" feature, I knew this was a good choice. The handbook is quite funny, but never forgets to offer honest, helpful advice for your best man. My best man really appreciated it, and I would recommend this to anyone looking to help out their best man."
1,Horrible.,"My mom and I found this book in a store and bought it as an xmas gift for my fiance's dad. He mentioned he had NO idea what to do as a best man, so we wanted to give him something to help. I brought the book home and read it and I was astounded. Here I was thinking it was an honest, helpful guide. (It seemed like one when I flipped through the pages in the store) However, I was MOST disappointed to see that it was much more something you might give an 18 year old best man as a joke and hope he gets it. It made a mockery of a very important role in any wedding and I would NEVER recommend it to anyone. Utterly useless.Taken as a joke, it's passing funny. But if you're looking for something helpful and useful....look elsewhere!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Books are of little value in planning a bachelor party. I read this book and had to laugh. For a suggestion that is a no brainer (if you are in the tri-state area) check out www.billydeans.com. I read someone elses posting took their advice and had my buddy's bachelor party there. Great value, heck of a lot of fun. He partisipated in the oil wrestling and I never laughed so hard in my life. SCRATCH the books when it comes to this subject!"
1,Horrible,The phone arrived earlier than I expected very nice phone but it did not work well with my cell phone service(at&t} dropped calls I was yelling no one could hear me on the other end I kept it about a week had to send back to hassle free I am still waiting for my refund
2,Lonely Planet or Rick Steve's offer a better guidebook,"After traveling in Europe for four months now, I have used the Let's Go, Lonely Planet, Frommers, and Rick Steves guides. The only thing I really appreciated with the Let's Go books were their colored maps of certain major cities (which you can pick up at any tourist information center without buying the book). Their directions for getting to places were very vague--I couldn't find half of the hostels or restaurants I wanted to go to with this book. In addition, I found some of their smaller maps to place icons of places in completely different locations than where they were located in the city, but they still gave the correct address. Lonely Planet books were much more reliable, and I believe that the Rick Steves' books are the best on the market if you want to actually experience a city and not just it's tourist traps with ""We speak english"" in every window."
5,Excellent Guide,"Let's Go was an invaluable part of our trip to Europe. It has a lot of countries you probably wont be visiting, so the weight of the book can seem daunting at times. It's defiantly not a pocket guide, but it does a great job of listing where to sleep, eat and have fun in each city. I would say it doesn't offer much commentary or advice on the actual sites (get an Eyewitness guide for that) but is essential for it's hostel/hotel listings. The information was very accurate (although the prices have gone up a little) and the transit time information was great for planning an itinerary ahead of time. As far as overall resourcefulness, I would say it beat Rick Steve's, Eyewitness and Lonely Planet. It's also oriented towards people who want to have fun and is the best guide for nightlife listings."
3,Helps if you're going to be driving around Portland,"Basically, it's a map of Portland, in book form. It's similar to a Thomas Guide, but slimmer. As I recall, it was easy to read and use. It did help me make my way around Portland when I visited for a few days. Not much else to say about it. It does the job."
2,"Lots of Promise, Shabby Delivery","I wasn't really expecting much from a budget-label DVD set, but I do pick them up on the cheap when I can as a means of screening obscure or hard to find films. That way I can decide whether or not to seek out better, higher-quality editions.In this instance, the films were the sort of 50's and 60's era blood and thunder you'd expect, but the faded, beaten and tinny-sounding public domain/TV prints they used left the films more anaemic and wheezing than blood and thunder.The fault is not the films themselves (which are actually rather interesting), but rather with the shabby, low-budget source material used and the indifferent digital transfer.As the previous reviewer stated, I would be embarassed to screen these for a Bible Study group or film appreciation class, but for private home viewing they should tide you over until somebody releases better editions."
1,Material Too Old,"No reviews available pre-purchase. Set was Totally useless. Laughably out-of-date. Poor color. Two disks had flasws at the ends. I wanted to use them for a Bible study group, but wound up throwing the three dvd set in the trash. The cost and trouble of returning for credit were not worth the effort. -- Zero stars but one star was the lowest rating accepted. -- I exopected better of Amazon."
2,"A bit better than Classics 1, but still... (2 STARS)","This is the better of the series, but that isn't saying much, considering poor playing, poor production, and poor track selection on ""Classics Live 1."" A couple of the usual suspects are here (""Back in the Saddle,"" ""Walk This Way""), but the interesting stuff is Joe Perry's ""Let the Music Do The Talking"" and the first Tyler-Perry collaboration (and one of Aerosmith's best songs to date) ""Movin' Out."" But even so, ""Classics Live 2"" is almost as dull as the first. Overall: 4 out of 10."
2,Ummm... it's alright.,"""Classics live 2"" isn't any better than the first one. Aerorock, once again, that classic sound."
4,Aerosmith pounds out the favorites,"While ""Live! Bootleg"" (1978) is the ultimate live Aerosmith album for any true fan, Classics Live II is definitely a more polished and accessable affair. Whereas Bootleg was riddled by some weaker performances (on the band's best-known songs, no less) and an intentionally sloppy delivery, Classics Live is like a very short, but very hard-hitting concert with the band in top form. IN fact, every performance here is brilliant, except (in my opinion) ""Walk This Way"", which loses something in Steven's awkward vocal delivery. But classics like ""Back in the Saddle"", ""Draw The Line"", ""Last Child"" & ""Same Old Song And Dance"" have never sounded better. And the highlight of the record is an OUTSTANDING performance of one of the band's earliest tunes, ""Movin' Out"" - far surpassing it's original studio recording. A great album for dedicated and casual fans alike - just a shame it's so short."
3,"It's Ok, But The Drum Sound Is Terrible","Other than the cheesy mid-80's synthesized drum sound, this live album is ok. Most of this album was recorded during the ""Back In The Saddle"" tour. While it's definately better than the mostly lacklustre 'Live Bootleg', I think the original 'Classics Live' or 'A Little South of Sanity' are a lot better. That terrible drum sound really ruins this record in my opinion."
5,witches what more do you need to know,I have the orginal limited to 1275 copy of this book it is interesting to anyone who wants to understand the insanity of the witch hunt in this country and europe.The author desribes in detail the way one was tested to be a witch and the vocabulary is plain and easy to understand for all.A must for all occult collectors!
4,"Required to use your RPS, but expensive and short. Also, not for new 2960S","I'm using these short, heavy-duty cables with my Cisco RPS2300, and older Cisco Catalyst 2970 and 2960 gig switches. The cables are as expected: heavy-duty, proprietary design, looks like good quality, and you'll pay the premium price because you need it to use your RPS unit.They really could be a few feet longer. Even in a well designed telecom rack, these cables are on the short side for going top to bottom.Although the Catalyst2970 is too old to be listed in the official support matrix for the RPS2300, I found online release-notes indicating support, and tested that failover functioned as expected. Also note that contrary to the manual, the newest Cisco 2960S models have the larger RPS connector like the 3750/3560 does, and thus require theRPS Cable for 3750Einstead of this one."
2,Doesn't Work on Slatwall,"This simply doesn't work with slatwall systems because there is no clip on the bottom of the item. When you slip your bike tire in the item it just lifts the bottom of the item out of the slatwall and the whole thing falls down. It would probably work well if you screwed the item into a wall (without the slatwall) but that is not why I purchased it.If you are planning on using this with a slatwall system, DON'T. It doesn't work. I returned all four of these I purchased."
3,JUST WATCH OUT WITH THIS SET!,"Although the core program is excellent and well thought out, they would have you believe that there is a complete CD instruction program with the texts. Each book has a ""sample"" CD for the course. If you want the complete instructional set of CD's, be ready to hand over some big bucks. The practice test CD set, however, is complete.I would have given it five stars, except for the ""ripped-off"" feeling, after I learned the instructional CD's were just a sample of a very costly program."
1,Didn't focus on how to apply knowledge,"These books are awful! I am a IS Manager for a school district and the typo's I found were frustrating. For example, I used it as a quick reference for the proper UNC path for user profiles. I kept racking my brain for two hours trying to figure out why it wasn't working. I finally realized that the path they had written down (\\server_name\winnt\profiles)(p.346 in NT server 4 book) was completely wrong!!! The proper path shopuld be \\server_name\profiles\username.Sorry, just venting. Buy the Exam crams if you want to be MCSE. I struggled with the Sybex books for 6 months. I bought the Exam Crams and passed all 6 exams in 5 monthsJeff Tangen MCSE"
3,I haven't read it yet,"But so far, I give the books 3 stars. I hope they will help me achieve my dream of being a blackjack wizard."
3,"Good for the basics, but...","Their 3 NT books (Workstation, Server, Enterprise) really only deal with the absolute basics of what is tested on the exams. The Networking Essentials book is premium - the only book you need to pass that one exam.But to pass the other 3 exams you need to supplement what this series gives you. The 3 NT books only go over the basics, not some of the more advanced material that is covered on the exams. You CAN pass with only these books, but it might be difficult. You may want to also buy the red CRAM pack book series by a different publisher.I'd say this series covers a good 75% of what is tested on the exams. I don't regret buying them, you just have to supplement the NT books ;)"
2,Comprehensive but Dated Data on Executive Recruiters,"It's pretty obvious Kennedy put a bunch of time into the collection of recruiter information. Even still, the phone and fax numbers had a ridiculous number of errors. The time it took to backtrack the errors made for frustrating hours of work. Let's just say the whole experience was marginal.Executive search information in printed form might not be able to keep up with evolving data.Get it when it first comes out next year or not at all."
4,Not good in a bad economy,"If the economy is bad, this book does not help a lot. Because companies do not use headhunters as much. But as soon as the economy comes back, I would buy the latest version again...."
3,"Comprehensive, but can't install the much needed software","The book is a comprehensive listing of virtually every recruiter imaginable. Importantly, the book sorts the recruiters by state, specialty, retainer vs. contingency, etc. The book is so volumnous, that it makes sense to purchase the recruiter management software on the CD-Rom included with the book. I purchased the software but, after struggling with it for a good while, I learned it could not be installed on my computer for technical reasons. The publisher gave up trying to get it installed, and sent me the 2001 CD. You're probably better off waiting the 1 - 2 weeks needed for delivery of the 2001 edition."
3,Quality is lower,"I've used Thinkpads as far back as the 600E. I travel a lot for work and preferred Thinkpads because of their rock solid performance. Now that I've recently upgraded from a T41 to a T60, I think Thinkpads have gone down in quality. Not sure if it has anything to do with IBM selling the business unit to Lenovo (Chinese company).Anyhow, this T60 feels a lot more ""plasticky"" than the T41. It just seems cheap and flimsy. I also have a lot of problems docking and undocking this machine. With the T41, I can undock the machine, run to a conference room, open the laptop and not miss a beat. The T60 has problems adjusting screen resolutions, recognizing my mouse on the dock, and crashes with the blue screen of death. I feel pretty frustrated right now..."
5,Shame about Big Rosie,"Great album,with 4 tracks standing out Half a Minute,Get out ofyour lazy bed,Who's side are you on,and sadly not on the cd buton tape Big Rosie.I've loved this album for years,and still playit on a regular basis,I can only say 'buy it now!'"
4,O My God.,"What can i say about Tekkaman? It truly is one of the classics, while Stage II is not as good as Stage I, it still grips you and makes you want more. Now if only the blasted things would come out on DvD! If anybody knows when, tell me!"
2,just ok,the squirt is a few short of a whiz.its only the pliers that make this any better than a mini-swiss army.I should have got the juice then id whiz
3,Shouldn't be this expensive.,"Great MT if you need something tiny and compact yet functional.This MT is outdated and no longer manufactured. It should be cheaper as a result. The brand new PS4 is cheaper than this one, and more recent. Not to mention a more modern style as well as a bit better thought out. Just my 2 cents."
5,Pocket Squirt,This is my third Leatherman. This is the one I will carry daily. The Wave requires the belt sheath to carry and the Micra is all about the scissors. The pliers and knife are getting the most use.
5,Lots of Utility in a Little Package,"This is a great little gadget. First of all, all of the utilities are high-quality. The screwdrivers, file, and pliers are durable and functional (sorry, no fish scalers on this product).Second, I would prefer a bit longer blade on the knife, but it holds an edge, and comes in handy.This is a great gift for just about anyone. We keep one in our car and it comes in handy all the time. I would purchase this item again in a heartbeat."
4,"Great keychain ""tool""","I've gotten more use out of these things than you could imagine. They are good tools, I've broken 3 already though, that's why it only gets 4 stars. I probably use them for more than they are able to handle. I haven't tried to send them back to leatherman yet for a repair. I think they have a lifetime warranty so I might try that out."
4,Great blade; little weight,Razor sharp blade at a very pocketable weight. A must for any hiking trip.
2,Cheap filters,These are cheap filters. The CPL fell apart the first time I used it. After I put it back together a couple of times I ordered another much better quality CPL which works great. Even the case for the filters is cheap. It will not snap together. I would not recommend this filter set.
2,Small,"Small book, with little information.Photos are too close/zoomed in. The chapter for m22 locust was only a few pages.Do not recommend"
3,Only three stars!?!,"Let's get started by saying I really like (I'm learning to love) this compilation. I can remember when John Peel had the Saturday afternoon show on BBC Radio 1 and have followed him ever since (not literally like some people).The reason I give this three stars is because it's not enough. It touches on all styles of music you'd expect from Peel but just barely. There are good and quirky examples of everything you'd expect but that's it.Another slight complaint is that for those people who have heard, or heard of, Peel's legendary live sets at Fabric (I've only had the pleasure of going once) the charm is missing here. There are none of the random stops, records at wrong speeds or backwards, or anything you could imagine."
5,A great early recording w. excellent remastering,I love Steve Earl's music and have since his very early days on this album. The SACD treatment gives it a body and fullness nearly matching the LP version on which I first heard the music. The clarity of the music is phenomenal.
4,I didn't want to like this.....,"My store stopped carrying the wax I've used for years, so I had to try something new. I bought this brand and another to compare. The other will go back to the store because it can't be microwaved.When I heated this up, it was very sticky. When I applied it, it left ""tails"" which I don't like. But, I went ahead and used it.OMG....it did a great job! I used it on my chin, upper lip, and eyebrows. I didn't have to re-do any area because it captured all the hair. There is no residue and no little clumps of wax left. My skin is not irritated or red. It is very smooth and soft.If you can handle the mess, it is worth it!"
5,great product,Great product. Easy to use as long as you get the temperature just right. works well if you follow the directions.
3,ehhh,I saw the reviews and I bought it thinking it would be messy but work but i didn't expect it to be that messy! it hardly worked too it took off about 50 percent on my cheek and i have had a million little bumps on my face for over a week. they aren't red its just all bumpy and dry. prob wont use that again
2,Not good enough,"I'm a professional nail tech with a wax license and have over 4 years of professional waxing experience. I have used hard wax for almost 2 years and know what I'm talking about. Normally I use wax warmer and pot wax at home but I wanted something for travel. I thought the microwavable is the answer, I was wrong about this one. This wax does not melt properly with recommended time, it brittles easily and does not remove all hair. I couldn't believe I have to apply second time for upper lip. I will try other professional brand microwavables, at least they have a little handle that won't burn my hand."
1,Very painful and ineffective,"To be completely honest, this product did not work well. The gel would stick to my skin and it was very painful to remove. Also, it removed very little hair."
2,Messy and didn't work.,"I'm no expert at waxing, but I'm pretty certain I did everything just as the directions describe. But I tried this wax on my legs and it did little more than get all over my bathroom--just a little bit here, and a little bit there, but it's very hard to clean up. And I actually moved my microwave into the bathroom to try and minimize the mess.I tried it on my upper lip, too, and it worked a little better there, but it still left quite a bit of fuzz. Maybe 2 or 3 tries would have gotten it all, but of course, it hurts (no surprise), and I didn't think the repeated pain was worth it.Also, I'm not sure how this amount of wax is supposed to be enough for your legs--the best I could come up with was to keep reusing the same wax...?Oh, well, it was an experiment. If I ever decide to wax again, I'll go to a salon."
2,Only for tiny areas,"I've been using a rosin wax with strips for years and am very proficient. Thought a wax that didn't need strips would be faster. Maybe for small patches you can get the proper thickness, but on legs and thighs, putting down a longer length is necessary and keeping it thick is hard. Plus keeping that exact temp to maintain application is short lived. I had snibels of it all over my leg, had to scrape it off with a butter knife after soaking my leg in baby oil. Never again! $15 down the drain."
2,ogg 4 pc canister set,the tops are hollow. when you wash them its hard to get completely dry. i wanted something to hold 5 lb. of flour. i misread measurements. i wouldn't recommend this at all.
2,Kind of boring,"If you are curious about Tokugawa Japanese furniture or food, this is probably the book for you. However, if you really want to know what life was like, this book is lacking. Just listing 'everyday' things doesn't really paint a picture. There is nothing much about society or the people."
5,Opening Band For Ted Nugent at Mid California State Fair,"Travis Who? Heck, they played some kick butt rock for 30 minutes. Most from this CD. If you like Joe Satriani, Jeff Beck, or Steve Vai...Then you'll love this CD and band. They're a local band that is making a name for itself. I enjoyed them so much I bought both CD's!!! Superb group. Worth the $$$$"
1,"Keep looking, over priced and out of date","This notebook is out of date and is way out classed by rivals in the same price range.What I don't like:SDRAM? Most notebooks in this price range offer DDR-SDRAM. DDR transmits twice the data with each clock, making it much faster. SDRAM has been abandoned.1.3 GHz Athlons: They run hot and lack SSE-2. SSE-2 is a feature built into current Intel and future AMD CPUs. If you don't have it, software that uses it will run slower. This includes major products like Windows, Adobe, and many games.ATI RAGE MOILITY graphics chipset? Very old news with almost no 3D features. Notebooks that cost 30% less are at least offering the ATI Radeon M6-P or even ATI 7500 chipsets.If this notebook was half the price I could endorse it. At this price it is highway robbery. Either look at Toshiba, HP, Gateway or Dell, or move up the Sony price range into one of their newer P4 based notebooks. I'm sure this left over is about to be discontinued."
2,worst laptop I've owned,"I've had this notebook computer for just under 2 years and in that time it has been nothing but problems. It constantly locks up and runs much hotter than any other laptop I've ever had. It has crappy speakers,it's sound is intermittent and the restore function does not always work. I've had to reformat the hard drive 9 times since owning it and now the monitor no longer works. Sony charges insane prices for it's repair as well as it's accesories. I've always used it as more of a desktop so hooking it up to an external monitor is an acceptable although irritating solution for the monitor problem. It won't however change the fact that this is a lousy piece of machinery."
5,Great book to have!!,"I you are interested in Reiki, Seichim and SSR or if you want to learn about Reiki, Seichim, SSR.. This book will explain everything you need to know and more."
4,"Good addition to the excellent ""Night's Dawn"" trilogy","""A Second Chance At Eden"" is a short story collection by science fiction author Peter F Hamilton. All stories are set in the same universe as his acclaimed Night's Dawn trilogy (comprised of ""The Reality Dysfunction"", ""The Neutronium Alchemist"" and ""The Naked God""). This collection fills in the period leading up to the first book in the trilogy and spans about 500 years. The stories describe the first uses of the affinity gene, the founding of the Edenist culture, and the discovery of the Laymill by Marcus Calvert (yes, the father of the trilogy's hero Joshua Calvert). The story ""Escape Route"" was included in the fifteenth edition of ""The Year's Best Science Fiction"" (ed. Gardner Dozois).The collection as a whole is uneven in quality, but definitely interesting for fans of the trilogy."
1,Creativity at its finest,The only decent stories in this book are the second and second to last. The rest are short and hackneyed -- SF at its pulpiest.Don't waste your time.
4,I couldn't stop reading for 6 hours,"This compilation of stories, cleared out the many questions I had about the technologies he uses in the NightDawn trilogy, making it more viable and intrigueing. The plots of the stories were quite funny, often up to the horrific, however not always as consequent as the ones used in the NightDawn trilogy. I sure hope he'll supply us furthermore with this superb quality SF, ritch in ideas, character descriptions and tales of strange worlds, thus becoming one of the writers I hold dearly on top of the bookshelves. I also hope his editor won't rush him into publishing too soon the third part of the Night Dawn trilogy I was expecting to see first. The appearance of this book might be a good sign.Jelle Mulder"
5,I hoped it would hold me over until 'Naked God' was released,but I finished it in two days. Now I'm left wanting for more! Hamilton's imagination has brought us several interesting stories that add more detail to the incredible universe that started in the Reality Dysfunction. This book and the rest of the series have been the best SciFi I've ever read.
5,This makes perfect sense!,"At last, here's a book for people who love to eat (as I do). Given the choice between deprivation and reward, I'll take reward any day. And The Cheater's Diet really works, even for a chow-hound like me. The weekday meals are delicious, and Dr. Rivas has recommendations for strategic cheating that are, well, pretty appetizing. Enjoying this instead of hating it. Six pounds off in two weeks, and I don't feel like I'm depriving myself of anything. I'm going to stick with this plan."
4,"Finally, the world can see what works for me","I've actually been following this diet for years, and now there's a book to tell people how it's done. My version is slightly different, but Rivas' version seems logical, too. I count calories, but allow myself to have (and really enjoy) small things each day, like 2 dark chocolate Hershey's kisses with a cup of tea, or something similar. I found that for me, such indulgences helped me stay on track without bingeing. I know some people (as one review here states) can't eat just a small amount of their favorite foods, or can't allow themselves to cheat on the weekend because then they'll cheat all week, but I'm a ""Cheater's Diet"" fan from way back! Rivas sets it out for others to try in a sensible diet plan."
4,Good Book,Another good diet that's a little easier to stay on because you get to eat what you want on weekends (more or less). Worth a try.
1,"2 Reviews? Both Excellent? No Other Books? From Maryland, Where Dr. Rivas resides?",Sounds like a setup to me.
4,only the weekends are fun,"the rest of the week is hard. no fun during week daysI liked the supplemets it reccomends. very cheap and proven to help.The author is honest about exercise. it tells you what it can do.the first pages...i found them to be a lot of blah blah.about the cheating. You can indulge with moderation on weekends sinful foods.The main difficulty is to have the strengh to return back on track during week days. I have done this kind of diet many times and it boosts the metabolism. iF YOU ARE CONSISTENT, you will rarely hit a plateau. During weekend the scale will move up but after 2 days the numbers go down fast.This happens only if you eat moderately. It can be hard once you start to stop. You wont lose much if you eat 6000 cals the weekend, that is for sure."
5,Quality products,Simple and elegant design. I've been a WMF fan (mostly knives) for years because their products don't tend rust like most of the other brands I've used. I decided to try more of their ranges and so far I have not been disappointed.
3,Turntable,"They are small & don't hold a lot, but they work well for the size cabinet I have by the stove. Without them I would not be able to reach anything in the back without a step stool. They are very well made & the price was good."
1,Save your money,"After attempting to cut 2 lines on a pattern, the scissors only ""grabbed"" the fabric. I took them to a professional scissor sharpener who indicated they weren't worth it & showed me why. The cutting surface on both sides of each blade did not remain as wide from top to bottom of each blade. In other words, there was NO sharp side to work on. He would be working on the blade itself & not on the cutting surface of the blade. He told me to get my money back when I told him what I had paid for the scissors. I clearly saw what he was referring to as he was pointing out the discrepancy & poor workmanship. The cutting surface was non-existent halfway down each blade clearly indicated by a darker hue on each side of each blade. Am very disappointed as I thought I was getting a quality product from Italy. Can't blame Amazon. Just one of those things!"
4,modern president,This is one of the best in the UKanss Presidency series. Gould makes an effective argument that McKinley was the first modern president. This account helps to dispell the notion that McKinley was no different than the other Gilded Age Presidents. A really good read!
2,A Curious Glimpse of Michigan,"I read the 5 star review and I cannot see what that reviewer found so interesting in this book. It does not have that much information. The book has 32 pages, but most of the space is filled with art which looks like it was made by children. This type of art may appeal to some people, but not to me. Even though I am an adult, I do not think most kids will like it much either- the book and the illustrations."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Bitware is a waste of money - I received my first version (Cheyenne) with my modem several years ago and it worked very well. After Accpac took over - and ""upgraded"" I have not been able to get it to work correctly. Technical support is a joke and their customer service is poor. I was told it worked with XP so they were more than happy to sell it to me but once I notified them that it wouldn't work they offered several excuses blaming my modem (even though my new modem came with the software??) Save your money - check on Venta Fax & Voice, a much better product. Needless to say, I will never use their product again."
1,Download,"Your download stinks. I purchased a download that said I could get the program within 30 min,,,,,,,,,,,,NOT........I can't get the program I purchased and you won't answer my email attempts to contact you. I give your service a negative 3 1/2 stars and will not use your service again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Function surpasses the form. It needs help.,"GOOD: Excellent voice quality. Flexible voice mailbox routing. Runs in the background (in Windows system tray). Releases modem so I can connect to Internet without having to exit Bitware. Easy faxing. Speakerphone-compatible.BAD: Answers calls at random instead of after the designated number of rings, which interrupts phone calls and fills Inbox with useless messages of recorded converstations.UGLY: It takes too many clicks to access your inbox (New Message window, main messaging window, Inbox, and then my Inbox).Simply Bitware 8.2.860 came bundled with my Broadxent voice modem (supported by Creative, aka ModemBlaster v.92 PCI). The box said Windows XP-compatible, so I expected the modem to cooperate with the bundled software and my computer. Neither ACCPAC or Creative have been able to solve my problem after nearly two weeks of seeking their help. If not for the faxing, I'd have been happier with a [price] standalone answering machine."
1,Does not perform as advertised,"Don't buy this product. It is advertised as being able to handle multiple phone lines using a separate modem for each line. Technically that is correct, but the software is unable to identify which phone line is calling and dumps the caller into a mailbox selection routine.I wanted to use the software for my two phone lines, one for personal callers, one for my business. When it answers a call, the voicemail asks :if you are business caller select mailbox 1, if you are a personal caller select mailbox 2. For any kind of serious business this is no use.The product literature and tech support describe this software as suitable for small office/home office. This software is obviously not suited for either of these enviroments.When I contacted tech support, and asked if this product will answer multiple telephone lines independantly, they said I need their professional Bitware software ...Don't buy this software it doesn't perform as advertised."
1,Software that Simply...doesn't work.,Don't buy this software.I upgraded from the Windows 95 looking version 3.3 and the software isn't able to tape the messages.The support? Always modem's drivers fault.Note that the previous version was working with the same drivers and same configuration!!Simply...ridicolous!
3,Large but not too large,"I purchased these in error thinking they were a smaller size, but I wore them a few times and after a few compliments don't have a problem with the size. I had always worn the 1 5/8"" and now I have both. Enjoy!"
2,Depends what you are looking for...,"These earrings are very thin hoops, which I knew from the product description. They are hollow and not polished or shiny. They are very lightweight. It all depends what you are looking for, I guess, as to wether or not these will suit you. I do not prefer dull looking sterling, so these were a disappointment."
1,Disappointing,"The entire tape is talking head and the information is given as ""helpful tips"" not anyhing deep enough for discussion."
3,they are starting to strech it,"this video is a exellent overview of disney's musical talents featuring ""the early years"" in my opinion they are streching this a bit to far even though it is enjoyable the only questuionis why? This video is short and not really fufilling I suggest that the full movies should be bought all of this classics deserved to be owned"
5,This is ambient/space at its best,"This is possibly O'hearn's best album to date, mingling upon the waters of a more melancholic and thoughtful ambience. One of those rare albums where just hearing any one of the songs would have compelled me enough to buy the album."
3,Extraordinarily Mysterious,"Over 3 years went into this? ""Metaphor"" wasn't that great but it does have some good tunes on it. I hoped O'Hearns next effort would be at least as good. The best thing I can say for ""So Flows the Current"" is that parts of some of the songs sound good but never seem to go anywhere. You can only drag out a catchy tune for so long until it starts to drive the listener up the wall. It is beyond me how anyone who has heard this can rate is as good or better as his previous work. I haven't given up on his music but I may wait till I see some reviews before I buy his next CD unheard."
5,Another masterpiece,"Dreamy, surreal, creative and compelling. So what else did you expect? Patrick O'Hearn continues to grow with the years. A detraction from his otherworldly, sometimes frenzied, kinetic soundscapes, this is another great work. Only one or two tracks left me wanting, the rest bear close examination which will keep you coming back again and again. Hey, for a guy who likes Buddy Rich this must be good to enjoy. Do that - enjoy!"
1,Really boring and lifeless,"I was looking forward to listening to this CD because I really enjoy Patrick's work, and was let down big-time. I thought this CD was boring and lifeless - I liked only one track. And almost all of the tracks featured other instruments and hardly any keyboard. Huh?If you like Patrick O'Hearn, listen to Beautiful World and some of his other CDs to get the real feel of his magic. Too bad."
5,Well Worth The Wait,"After a tortuously long wait O'Hearn has managed to turn in yet a(nother) simply flawless performance. Noticeably devoid of his trademark electronic sampling this time around, his latest is a bit more mellow, a touch more ""organic"", a shade more hearfelt than his others. You won't find any danceable grooves or tribal overtones on this album ... instead he paints for us a decidedly more serene and sensitive aural landscape by utilizing a more acoustic palette. The end result is a refreshingly bold and evolutionary step forward in O'Hearn's already distinguished musical career. I have a lot of respect for this artist, and have been a devoted fan since his first album over ten years ago. He has consistently impressed me with his imagination and innovative style. Whether you're a long-time fan like me or a relative newcomer, this album is absolutely required in your own collection -- you won't be disappointed. This is simply one of those rare gems which was well worth the wait!"
2,"Unfortunately, by far my least favorite O'hearn effort : (","It's hard for me to say, but unfortunately, So Flows The Current offers only 4 good tracks. The rest stumbles along aimlessly and fruitlessly. Patrick continues w/ a more acoustic natural sound on this one but most of the compositions just fumble along never taking shape. The opening track is one of the better ones, bringing to mind the images of the swells of an ocean. Tracks 2 & 4 are the others I enjoy, the rest bar perhaps one other are feeble at best. This is so difficult for me to say as I've been such a HUGE fan since '88. PO is by far one of my favorite artists and to have such a let down is tough to swallow. I guess I'll have to wait for his next release. Until then, there's always the River, Indigo, Eldorado & Trust. If you're a new O'Hearn fan, go to these other albums first. If you're an old fan, SFTC is worth having for the true enthusiast who must have all his stuff. Afterall, there are 4 good tracks in there to be heard."
2,What a shocking disappointment!,"Patrick O'Hearn has been my favorite musician since the late 80s. I adore his music. When I heard a new CD was forthcoming, my head nearly exploded, I was so psyched! Unfortunately, this CD really disappoints. It's my least favorite of all his works. It's sleepy and dreamy, a la some of the less percussive tracks on ""Metaphor,"" and more in the style of his first two albums. Somehow, it lacks the mysticism and magic of those albums, though. There's just some piece of soul missing from this CD. It's melancholy, and just somehow ""lacking."" Buy it anyway - support our favorite artist, but don't expect this new one to rock your world."
3,Robotech: The Failed Sentinels Series,"The primary focus of this third installment of the Robotech Art books is the art and planned storyline of the failed series, Robotech II: the Sentinels. For an ""art"" book, this one is rich in text. However, if you are a die hard Robotech fan, this is the only reliable source of information concerning the series and its development (or lack thereof). I for one recommend it if you want to round out your Robotech collection."
3,"Interesting Lists, but Be Careful","I enjoyed reading the author's suggestions for movies, however, I was confused why the author would include the movie Forrest Gump in the category for 4th to 6th grade. There are some scenes in the movie that are definitely not age-appropriate to that group. A mistake? Therefore you may need to judge for yourself each of the movies suggested and not show them to your children without previewing them yourself."
2,Not much here,I was disappointed at this slim volume that includes a lot of well-known titles. It feels like it was quickly thrown together to take advantage of the current interest in boys. I'd expect more from Gurian.
2,Eh.,"I didn't really find this book to be that helpful. It was a good idea, but not well executed, and to be most effective, it really needs to be updated on a regular basis. If you don't really know much about books for boys, maybe it could help you make some decisions. And maybe you will end up choosing a lot of books your son isn't interested in and won't read. Use caution."
5,"Excellent Idea, But Left Out The Best One","This book is an excellent idea. However, the authors left out what I have found to be the best one for our sons AND OUR DAUGHTERS. Add the book, ""West Point"" by Norman Thomas Remick to your list (in fact, this should be first as it gives the basics). It's a veritable education in character and leadership."
3,Hmmm...why you might not need to buy this book,"I love Amazon's Search Inside the Book feature but in this case is it doing the author any favors when it lists most of the books (listed by age group) which he suggests are appropriate? If you can see the books and movies, why buy the book?ALso, just by glancing over the contents I could see which movies would work for my kids and which they'd seen or didn't like. This was enough to convince me that the book had nothing new to say to me that I hadn't already seen by using this feature.Sorry. But that's my take."
2,Censorship?,"Amazon Instant offers a 1-click option to ""Buy Season 7"", yet fails to indicate that the season finale (a criticism of the Vatican) is omitted.My low rating is based on this fact."
4,great scissors,I like this tool a lot. It's scissors are so much better than the ones on my previous Swiss army knife. I think the tweezers are much better as well. It is nice to use all of the tools except scissors while the tool is closed. The gray is a good looking color and has not chipped yet. My biggest complaint is it's weight. It's almost too heavy for MY key chain. I'd estimate it's about twice as heavy as the small Swiss army knife I have.
5,finder's keepers,My husband keeps losing it and keeps replacing it so it must be good. He uses it all the time. It's always on him.
5,Hubby loves this little tool,"I lost my guy's old leatherman (the orange one, I think it was a micra?), so I ordered this as a replacement for Xmas. He likes that it fits on his keychain; he also said the old one had problems with the scissors, but this one is really great."
2,Not so great,"I didn't get very much out of this game. It's not very attractive to look at, the theme is as pasty as they get, and the mechanisms are only slightly better. My species is evolving with the power of sky magic? What the hell is this? I thought this was a game about evolution and the invasion of territory by exogenous species. I didn't realize the mechanism behind this would be ""duels"" between the endogenous and invading animals using power-ups gathered by the population force.As you can tell, I don't really enjoy this game. If you like the way the game looks and plays (though I don't), what you'll get out of it is a decent brain exercise and a wholly counterfactual model of speciation. I hear Dominant Species is better, though it's made by a different company (GMT); in this line of games my favorite has been Terra Nova. It shares virtually nothing with CoP."
2,Mediocre black comedy from Robert Englund,"Actor Robert Englund directs this cheesy,low budget black comedy about a number 976-EVIL that possesses a nerd to have powers and then he kills people,while his cousin is making trouble. The movie is often confusing and sometimes gets tedious but the funny parts come from when the nerd named Hoax wants to be like his cousin and has a scooter and puts a engine and calls it his motorcycle and when the fish fall from the sky. Kevin Yagher's special effects are average and the acting is uneven. Not the worst horror movie but not the best either. Englund quit directing after this,Go figure"
2,I just don't know anymore,"Well, this is the typical highschool story ... nerd grown up next to jock ... jock and nerd become friends ... nerd spies on jock having sex with girlfriend after jock inexplicably leaves blinds open even though he knows nerd lives next door and owns a telescope ... nerd calls mysterious phone number and is granted evil powers. Just like my highschool experience!! (I was the nerd). It is just entertaining enough to keep me interested, not quite good enough for me to wholeheartedly recommend it. There is a modicum of humor here (think Evil Dead), but the humor and interest fall apart in the final third of the movie. Eh. It's a way to kill an otherwise dull evening."
3,DON'T CALL US WE'LL CALL YOU,"Given a boost from the delightfully manic performance of Stephen Geoffreys (Fright Night), 976-EVIL is a tidy little thriller served up by screenwriter Brian Helgeland (Mystic River) and director Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund. Geoffreys plays a nerdish teenager who gets picked on all the time, a la Carrie White. He finds a vengeance via a telephone service called 976-EVIL which gives him satanic powers to wreak vengeance on those who have wronged him. While there are some weaknesses in the plot (just who is Jim Metzler anyway, who comes on the scene as some kind of private investigator, but without any previous indication as to his involvement in the plot), 976-EVIL has some chilling moments and Geoffreys (who left mainstream movies to make soft porn flicks) is effectively cast. Sandy Dennis also makes an impression as his somewhat eccentric mama."
2,Bad...but still good for a laugh.,"I wanted to get this because of Stephen Geoffrey's from Fright Night, and because it's directed by Robert Englund.Seems like it would be a great combination but it's not.First of all, many people seem to think this movie is a continuation of The Evil character from Fright Night, it is not.It has nothing to do with that character!!It's basically about this complete reject kid who decides to start calling a hotline for advice, turns all crazy/evil, and finally gets revenge on the people who treated him like crap.Lots of random parts, many what the F**k moments, and fish falling from the sky at one point.I'm still glad I watched it though, it's good for a laugh if you're into the old school 80's horror flicks. Still, not something I would buy again if I had to."
4,"Excellent! Well, the DVD itself isn't so excellent","One of the best ""fun"" horror movies of the 80's. Perfect atmosphere, great acting, nostalgic for those of us in our 30's. I think most people writing the reviews before me summed up the movie nicely. But I'm here to talk about the DVD itself, since you might buy it and think it's going to be top quality. We all expect top quality when we buy DVDs, so we're always disappointed when we buy a great movie like this and find that it's presented in FULL SCREEN. Also, no features. It's a cheap production, and the movie isn't as sharp and clear as should be. But it's not bad, it's serviceable. I don't think it's worth the price they're asking, but it's a hell of a lot better than the VHS copy I have."
5,Excellent Cookbook!,"This is the next best cookbook from the Junior League of Seattle. I have their first one, ""Simply Classic"" and it was a great cookbook. I waited for them to come out with another one and WOW! If you loved Simply Classic you will not be disappointed. This cookbook has excellent recipes that are gourmet in taste but are easy to prepare with everyday common ingredients. I hope their next cookbook they don't wait so long to publish!"
5,Fantastic book,"I've had this book as well as ""Simply Classic"" for 5 years now and they are my go-to books when I need a nice meal for guests. You know your meal is a success when your guests won't leave without a copy of the recipe. My family's favorites are Pork Tenderloin with Maple Glaze on pg. 185 and Gourmet Mac'n'Cheese on pg. 122. and there are so many more we love. The ingredient list can seem lengthy and specify a lot of fresh ingredients, but that's what makes the recipes so great. The recipes are not really complicated at all...give it a try."
2,Forced and Fake,"Horrible. The storyline dragged, and when it didn't, it was awkward and confusing. I have a feeling that York really wanted to use Detective Jack Thornton in a story, but couldn't figure out how his story might feature a werewolf, so she just came up with this weird, convoluted plot that had absolutely nothing to do with werewolves at all. The whole thing seemed forced.Also, after two books I think I've decided I officially don't like Rebecca York's dialogue. Again, it all sounded forced and fake. Yes, this IS a fiction book, so of course the dialogue is fake. BUT a good writer should make the dialogue sound believable...like it could actually have come from a real person...no matter what the situation is. This just didn't. It seemed very amateurish and unrealistic.I have the third in the series already, but I am really hesitating even starting it. I'm getting the feeling that Rebecca York just isn't my thing."
4,Great story,Very good steadfast pace kept your interest enjoyable supernatural aspect. I love to read any book were the characters come to life and it seems like your part of the story
3,cookie cutter story of the first book,"Maybe it wouldn't be so obvious if I hadn't read the stories back to back.....however. These books are almost identical in the basic premise of meet and instant attraction, can't live without, almost lose and expressions of all of this at times even verbatim from the first book. NOT VERY IMAGINATIVE! I have the first six in the series. After reading these first two I read the promo for the third and it appears the basic premise will also be the same. Usually I enjoy reading a series one after the other because I get inolved with the main character...then there is this type. Sometimes I can read another series and come back to them and sometimes not...here's hoping????"
1,A Big Disappointment,why is this the second book in a werewolf based series? ross was only a suporting charater and really only a tool the author used to bridge the gaps in the story so she could get back to the smut.. as a werewolf fan and not a romance fan i wished i just skipped this book and gone straight to the 3rd book. i've read all 3 books already and you can safely skip the second book and go to the 3rd and not miss much at all. the 3rd basically fills you in enough about the second book that even if she writes a forth with charaters from the second book you could still understand everything.
1,I paid for one year subscription twice,"I only received two issues, I will not renew my subscription with this company, be aware"
5,Indescribable,"This is an incredible release, reminiscent of vintage Neurosis. The louder you play this CD the more you will get out of it, and as an added bonus, increased volume will tend to lead you into a trance-like state. This CD is just so heavy and beautiful at the same time that it cannot be described, only experienced. Until you actually sit down and listen to this you won't be able to fathom what this band is about. It will take you on a long voyage assisted only by instruments and leave you stranded on an island of thought-provoking melody. Don't miss out on one of the most spiritual releases you'll ever come across within the metal genre."
5,Heavy. Heavy. HEAVY.,"This ep pounds some serious heavy tunes into your skull. Very deep, dark and elusive stuff, very hard to label. Some refer to this as doom, who knows, its a tough one. Pelcian isnt afraid to stray from the ultra super slow boring jams that we are used to hearing. Think Isis ""Mosquito Control"" but just a tad bit slowed down, and with no vocals. This ep is a must have. But it or be left behind."
2,Gross,"It smells great when you spray it on the card in a department store, but when you put it on your skin, the light summery smell instantly goes stale and you're left smelling like cheap cologne."
1,Not aftershave,"The item I received was cologne, NOT aftershave. Luckily I needed more cologne. Other than that, I have no complaints."
2,INFORMACION DE PRODUCTO,"SALUDOS ME DIRIJO A USTEDES PARA PEDIR SU COLABORACION, EN TAL SENTIDO NO E RECIBIDO EL PRODUCTO HASTA LA FECHA SEGUN FECHA ESTIMADA DE SALIDA DEL ALMACEN DEL VENDEDOR FUE EL 14 DE FEBRERO Y EL PRODUCTO SIGUE EN TRANSIT JUNTO A OTRO PRODUCTO POR FAVOR SOLICITO SU INFORMACION ACERCA DE EL PORQUE ESTE PRODUCTO NO ME HA LLEGADO A LA FECHA ESTIMADA 14 FEBRERO, Y QUE LLEVA EL NUMERO DE SEGUIMIENTO UPS 1Z8R87R00340495104.... GRACIAS."
2,Very light,"I'm not sure how any of the other reviewers received compliments from anyone other than family members considering that in order to smell this cologne you practically have to put your nose on the persons skin. It smells nice, but nobody (including the person wearing it) will be smelling it!"
3,smells like soap.,well trying this on at first it reminded me of irish spring bath soap. its smells good but not for someone looking for a more masculine scent.
1,Fake,"Ordered this cologne along with another one from Amazon LLC.They both smelled horrible and had clearly been previously unwrapped and resealed.Brought it to Macy's where the lady working got a kick out of this horrendous smelling cologne.She sprayed a legit Lacoste Essential onto a card, and it is a great cologne.Amazon, you've lost a customer."
5,Great Product,One of the best colognes I can find. It's not over powering but does smell great and the scent last a long time.
2,"Ugh, a mistake","I was hoping this best of CD would have some unknown treasures as anggun's Snow on The Sierras, but that's the standout track, nothing as good, and that one itself underwent the usual remix thing that ruined it."
5,Great shirt!,"My son was very excited to get this shirt- he is a HUGE Jack Bauer fan! Shirt was soft, sizes run try to fit - I wash in cold, inside out, and do not put in the dryer. Do this and the quality of the shirt will not fade."
2,I was really disappointed,"I was a new teacher in a difficult Baltimore school, and this book was very unrealistic and only scratched the surface of the problem. Ms. Moffett is an angel and to be admired, but the author Abby Goodnough Hollywood-izes her experience and really waters down the problems in inner city schools.I felt the author didn't really understand the experience of new teachers. She doesn't get into the student's lives at all. She doesn't seem to be upset or outraged by the terrible treatment of Ms. Moffett by the administration. And-- at the end-- she glosses over the fact that most of Ms. Moffett's colleagues leave the profession within a couple of years, meaning that hundreds of students still won't have teachers. This is deeply unfair to the students, but this book skims right over that injustice.This book is a simple, nice read, but it was not hardhitting enough and it gives no concrete advice or guidance to new teachers."
4,Bringin' Back the 80's,"I have a feeling this band would have done well in 1985. Crush 40 is high energy, guitar oriented hard rock. They sport some very nice solos, catchy tunes and heavy riffs. If you like Iron Maiden mixed with KISS, you'll love Crush 40. Songs like ""Live and Learn"" and ""Open Your Heart"" heavily lean towards metal while songs like ""Revvin' Up"" (as you could probably guess by it's title) can be catchy and almost pop-ish.But they really are underrated. Their guitarist can definatly shred, and their vocalist is amazing. He has a perfect rocker voice and I wish he could be in a more successful band."
5,Much appreciated!!!!!,"Thanks for the complete series. This was purchased for a friend that had been waiting patiently for the day for me to say "" I bought you Shaka Zulu. She was totally tickled to see this under her Christmas tree. Great service and price. Thanks again."
2,Epic mini-series + Real Zulu homelands + Supporting actors from Africa + Authentic costumes + Not interesting as the book,"I borrowed this set of 3 DVDs from my local library. They are epic mini-series. The background is real Zulu homelands. There are lots of supporting actors from Africa. The costumes look authentic to me. Despite all these, I found reading a book about Shaka Zulu is more interesting."
5,Zulu Warrior,Most stories depict the Zulu Nation at the time of Shaka as only savages. This was an inspiring storie. Well done. Well acted. Well directed. The role of Shaka was played with power. A must for your collection. And you'll love the soundtrack.
5,One of the best documentaries of the 20th century.,"This is one of the great movies that inspired me to write ""Knowledge For Tomorrow.""Although there are several historical faults, this movie should be shown worldwide, especially throughout Africa. More historically correct movies similar to Shaka Zulu should be made. The actor that starrred as Shaka should be a billionnare for his contribution to humanity by being the actor in that role."
1,Shaka Zulu-The Complete 10 Part Television,"I enjoyed the first couple of videos, they did give some insight into that time period in history. I also liked the attempt at being as authentic as possible."
5,Shaka Zulu,"I loved the, movie. It is great for the use of education from an unbiased perspective. It gives a great representation of the culture of the tribe. the DVDs are good quality too."
5,Great Movie For Anyone Who Likes Shaka Zulu,I saw this many years ago with my Dad and have not been able to find it since then. Finally found it. I loved it.
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this because I wanted a non-commercial viewing of the series. What I have is an over-edited copy of the TV show. A lot of the dialogue/action have been edited out! My question is why? If you're selling ""complete"" doesn't that mean all of the series?"
1,Short Changed,"I watched the entire series when it was aired on TV. I finally decided to spend $70.00 for purchase + shipping on Amazon. I'm so disappointed because there is a whole section missing. It doesn't show how Shaka was in training for war, how he took the throne from his brother and other important parts. What make matters worse is Amazon want returns to be unopened (which is impossible in this situation) or you should contact the merchant (How do I do that?). All I can say is be careful about what you purchase and make sure you really understand your options if you're not satisfied with the produce."
2,Misrepresentative of product,From Overman we bought a supposedly 10 epic series of Shaku Zulu. The epic was NOT the complete series that we had seen before (recently rented from Blockbuster). It was a shortened version. Overman has not communicated with me when I emailed him. Rip off product sold by someone that refuses to respond to an email. I will never buy from an outsourced person and may never buy from Amazon again.
5,Avid fan,"Great series. Full of history, and a great story line. I have been waiting a long time for this to come out on DVD. Very satified with the product."
5,Shaka Zulu Excellent Movie. 5 Stars and then some.,"I love this movie. I used to watch it on tv when I was a kid. I wanted to see it again so I bought it. Henry Cele is excellent as Shaka. The writing, the acting, the story- it's all fabulous. The characters are so dynamic. I appreciate the history behind it and what Shaka Zulu means to the South African people today. This movie is one of my all time favorites. It's about 8 hours long and I watched it twice- back to back. It has great replay value. It's a good movie to add to your collection if you like history, drama, action...It's all there."
1,another thick useless book.,"When will publishers learn that page-count is not THE sign of a good book - it's the content, stupid!this book is full of useless information. like reams of math equations that's useless to most casual readers and i'm sure too generic for the mathematically inclined.here's my ideal book...can someone publish a book that takes a newbie and tries to make him a real pilot - cessna is fine. let's get to step 1 first.all this in less than 100 pages. now i'd pay some money for that!"
3,A bit out of date,"This book has a lot of information packed in one volume. However, I think that virtual pilots may get more out of using a real flight training textbook such as From the Ground Up, or the Aeronautical Information Manual, used in combination with Microsoft's online manual. The included software is out of date. You can get newer and better software off the internet. I would pass on this one."
2,An overly lengthly and difficult to use reference,This is not the book to buy if you want to become a better pilot. It is chock full of all sorts of useless information including mathematical formulas that add little or nothing to one's ability to fly. What information is here is difficult to find for it may be buried on page 253 of the book's 1003 pages.
1,"Lecture, not film","I purchased this video counting on it to be the Alan Landsberg production of the same title, which I use in a college course on critical thinking. It is NOT. This video contains von Daniken giving a lecture that is a rehash of his books. of many of his books."
4,It touched me...,"As a reader who has had a first hand experience with an eating disorder this book touched me. Maybe it was because I found myself having so much in common with the character, maybe not, I don't know. But it seem with most books that have and eating disorder as a story the characters are hard to believe even for me, though I know how they are portraid is true. But, with this book i loved it from beginning to end, glad that the character was so much like me. I would recommend it for any one interested it a good story with an eating disorder topic."
4,Thought Provoking and Well Written,"I liked the way Rosen examines anorexia from a boyfriend's perspective and from a researcher's perspective. The narrator of the book, Joseph, who teaches English as a second language to Russian immigrants, seeks to understand his girlfriend's anorexia as diligently as an immigrant seeks to understand his new country. The book was well-written and unusual."
1,Only Read If You Like Perversion,"Ruth and Joseph live tgether. Ruth suffered an eating disorder in high school, and has saved documented conversations, tape recorded arguements, and diaries from this time. Joseph is a teacher, teaching Russian people the English language. Joseph knew about Ruth's disorder back when he feel in love with Ruth. He chooses to break into her diary, several times, and read and reread her diaries. He dwells on the eating disorder. All he can think about is sexual intercourse, and how her body radiates in sexual energy and sexual senses and sexual longing for him. He has needs, after all. He throws himself upon her one moment, after a bulimic episode, and that blew it for me, folks. It should have blown it for him, too, but he keeps on. I didn't even want to finish the book cause of it's sexual perversions. I don't know if this book is truely about anorexia, or if it's about something worse. Joseph would not give up on this poor woman, but I gave up on Joseph."
5,Complete and very helpful,"I am a traditional film photographer and what I really needed was a book that could bridge the gap between film and digital. This one really does that well. It starts with a review of digital cameras, but more important, goes into a discussion of the important factors in film and them moves the discussion of these important factors into the digital field. Great book, highly recommended."
4,Excellent reference book,Good presentation of basic facts of digital photography. Especially valueable I found the chapters that explained how cameras and digital cameras in particular work and what should be taken into account when selecting your camera.More advanced topics like editing images with your computer are also covered in an easy to follow fashion. Even though you might not do an awful lot of editing it's good to know where to find the guidance.This book is most suitable for someone who is not very experienced in photography but reasonably technically oriented and wants to create better quality images taking the best out of his or her camera.
4,Great for beginner,"Bought this book to go along with Digital Rebel XT purchase. The book has not disappointed. Explains everything there is from aperture, exposure, shutter speed etc in great detail yet easy to understand. Recommend it to beginner, intermediate & expert alike"
3,Needs a good editor,"This book explains entry level concepts well and touches upon all the topics one would need to start using a digital camera proficiently.I only award this book 3 stars since it appears that no editing or proof reading took place prior to going to press. Also, the author explains that there is more material on his web site. However, the web site appears to be still under construction, even thou this book was published in 2001!Hope this helps."
5,In 2004 This Book Still Holds Its Own,"I had my doubts when I bought this book because the book is over 2 years old. I wanted to learn about cameras to be able to make a good selection when I bought one but I was afraid the book would be too out-dated. I was suprised when I started reading. It gives you a good universal view of all digital cameras that are still applicable today. It teaches you the concepts from the inside out including technical terms. I was even impressed with the section on Photoshop, because I have worked with the program for two years and I still learned really interesting concepts. I now know what camera discriptions mean. It is worth the money but I would really recommend this book for a person who wants to purchase a camera or who has a camera and wants to understand the technical side of it better."
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I looked quite hard for a good digital photography book...before I chose this. I selected this one based on some of the reviews. I was really disappointed in the few color plates, and the black and white picture examples made it very difficult to see the author's point of discussion. I found quite a few printing errors too...but I can live with that, although it does cast an unprofessional cloud over the book. I have a small Kodak digital camera so am familiar with the basic technology of digital. I was (and still am)searching for a good book that includes weighty information on the latest SLR digital cameras and their front and back end processes...this book doesn't address that for me. I also got a real negative feel for digital as I read about the first ten pages and it tended to show me all the problems inherent with this technology. Thanks to Amazon who is giving me a refund...and I will continue my search."
5,Complete Digital Photography,"This book lives up to it's title. It is a great book for those just starting out, or for the advanced amateur switching from film to digital. Everything about digital is explained, from how the image is captured to how to print and present your final image. It's a great overview, with some excellant references for the more detailed topics. BUY IT!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I should have done extensive research prior to buying this book, it lacks a very important feature in my opinion, the sample pictures have no information on how it was taken, no shutter speed, ISO lens or F-stop guides. I later found such a book, but I will allow you to do your own research."
4,I love this book!,"I found this book extremely helpful, having just purchased a digital SLR. It is easy to read and very informative. I would recommend this book for someone that does not know a lot about digital SLR, but is familiar with a film SLR."
2,Some serious flaws,"Found a few parts of the book worthwhile regarding basic editing post photo being taken. However, after advising the reader what a great deal Adobe Photoshop Elements is and how we should save money and not buy the much more expensive big brother, he proceeds to spend a significant amount of time tutoring the reader on the use of curves and color channels. I searched extensively througout my version of Elements and could not find any access to color channels or curves. After searching on the web, I've concluded they aren't there. He also spends a lot of time discussing the use of layers. The layers discussion is impossible to follow using Elements."
4,Great Reference,This was a required text for a beginners digital photography class. It is well written and clear. Excellent for future reference.
4,Photo book,The person I gave this book to really enjoyed it. He is using it in his photography club.
1,A let-down,"My office just got one of these, as the company owner is Korean, and he felt obliged to buy a Korean product. (For those who don't already know, Zenith, an American brand, was bought out by a Korean manufacturer in the mid-90s, so it's now a South Korean company. Don't be fooled into thinking you are buying ""American."") Everyone is disappointed, including the boss. The picture is very fuzzy, and dark than other plasma TVs I've seen, including the Gateway one of the same size and price. At least Gateway backs up their TV with very good support. Zero support from the Korean Zenith. Nobody can figure out what's wrong with the picture, whether it's the plasma bulbs themselves or some setting we need to fiddle with. It's been a frustraing experience."
3,Not as good as Blues Deluxe but decent,Take it easy boys with these superlative reviews. Just because you like your new cd doesn't mean you should throw 5 stars at it. That rating should be reserved only for absolutelysuperior music of which this cd isn't. This is a slightly above average cd and not even close to being as good as Blues Deluxe.Why was I disappointed when I first listened to it? Because I got sucked in by all of the gushy Amazon reviews. Cut 7's nice in a Robin Trowerish kind of way. I'll be nice and give it a 3.5.
4,Now this is a good blues cd!,"If you like guitar driven blues ala Stevie Ray Vaughn, you owe it to yourself to check out Joe Bonamassa.This cd is a fantastic listen with good tunes abound. Joe's guitar work is very tasteful with sweet hooks and bone crunching riffs. Music doesn't always have to be heavy, to be heavy if you know what I mean and this release proves that point.From start to finish this release delivers the goods and I for one, can listen to this style of blues all day long!Check it out!"
