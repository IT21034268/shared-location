3,"Way too simple, but OK for kids","I find this book to be very superficial when it comes to the real deal. If you're looking for a book on catapults, you're going to get disappointed. This book focuses om making simple small scale models of catapults. I suppose it's great for a weekend project with your wannabe engineer kids, but if you're really interested in pre gunpowder siege warfare, you should rather take a look at Konstantin Nossov's book on siege warfare, which is a really thourough work. Also note that there aren't any metric units for the models, which complicates construction for the common european."
2,Nothing of real value to the builder here,"Looked though it and then threw it away. Not at all what I wanted. I expected some plans and materials for building devices, but what I got was some history and very little else of value. Delivered on time and in good condition."
4,Building model war machines,"I bought this book and another similar one because of an interest in ancient war machines. Now that I am retired, I am thinking of building some small scale models of machines like ballistas and trebuchets for fun and possibly for sale. I have not had time to study either book yet, but I skimmed through both and believe they are just what I wanted."
2,Needed some proof-reading.,"This book is interesting, and has some historical background, but isn't really intended for someone who plans to actually make these projects. Lots of the instructions are counter to the diagrams, and there are a number of mistakes (not entirely sure how one would drill a 1/2"" diameter hole in a 1/2"" diameter dowel, for example). If one follows the parts list, it is frustrating to get home, and find that necessary parts were not listed, or that the parts listed would be impossible to use where directed.This kind of book needs more editing than a read-through, and unfortunately, it didn't receive it."
4,Cry havoc and let slip the inner geek!,"William Gurstelle, The Art of the Catapult: Build Greek Ballistae, Roman Onagers, English Trebuchets, and more Ancient Artillery (Chicago Review Press, 2004)What can you say about a book like this? It's step-by-step instructions to build small models of the original weapons of mass destruction. Either you're going to be horrified by it or you're going to take one look at it and say ""that's the most awesome thing ever!"". You don't need a review to tell you which of those it's going to be, so I'm just going to step back, make like Janice on <em>The Price Is Right</em>, and let it work its magic. I will say for the record that some of these projects are probably not for beginners, all of them require adult supervision, and you can probably get arrested for using some of them in the suburbs. But then, if you're of the latter persuasion from the above, those things only add to the draw, don't they? *** 1/2"
5,"Nice, simple book","This is a good book for people interested in learning about early ballistics, and for those who want to help them learn. While I was thinking about my son when I bought this, I have to admit that I've had a lot of fun with it so far."
2,Breakable,"We built this and after first launch it broke. We were able to do a splint job, but still I would expect better."
2,Perhaps he should name it....Catapults for Kids.,"I was disappointed in this book. I was expecting some historically accurate designs and what I received was overly simplified plans presumably designed mostly for children. Yes, most of the text is related to the history of these weapons, but the plans left something to be desired. The ballista plan suggests use of a peanut as ammunition (not a bolt?) and the catch mechanism is nonexistent. The last project is a plastic-spoon-based basketball game. Enough said?"
2,Change the title to Local Greatest Gun Book,"One of the world's greatest handguns is the Wildey, it isn't even mentioned in the handgun section, in the WEB directory Wildey is mentioned as Widley !! It's a same.Another well known handgun and beatifully designed is the Tanfoglio (www.tanfoglio.it), it is only mentioned once in the Manufactorer's Directory.In the rifles section there's no mention about the Accuracy Precision Rifles (one of the best sniper rifles in the world).The front page is different on the one I got at home and the one shown on Amazon.com Why is that?The front page also says 'Complete Illustrated...' well it isn't complete at all"
3,"Good but,,,,,","If you have the 2001, 2002 or 2003 copies don't buy it, very few changes from those editions, otherwise, the book is an essentisl reference and I like the colored section on custom guns."
4,Original ghost story,"This is my first exposure to Masterton, and it has made me hungry for more. While it isn't as utterly frightening as some horror novels, it does have a few memorable moments. Its ""story-book"" premise is quite original and interesting. If you are a fan of classic literature and folk tales, there are a few hidden treats in the story. The ending felt a little rushed, but it wasn't unsatisfying. A nice, worthwhile read."
5,Terrifying,"Since I just purchased two other Masterton novels (Trauma, The Doorkeepers), I thought it prudent to review the first work I'd ever read by him. Spirit, is a terrifying work from the opening scene to the end. It kept me captivated and interested throughout. This is one of those books that if you have children, your heart will begin to race from the opening bell.In addition, Masterton's prose is of the highest quality. Few other authors can even hope to match him. I'm just glad I came across his work; better late than never.Cody James Wolfe- www.authorsden.com/codyjameswolfe"
3,difficult to find classic,We replaced the harder to find VHS with this dvd. A male favorite and not a classic for his wife..
2,Not very good,"I purchased this product with a lot of expectation of getting rid of my weeds. Its been a very dry summer and about the only thing growing was weeds. Lots of dandelions etc, so I thought it would be a great time to get rid of the weeds.I followed the instructions for mixing and spraying and one day applied the weed b gone. It rained about 30 hours after the application.One day after application, I could see a few dandelions were starting to wilt, I would say about 5 percent were wilting.Unfortunately it rained for about 3 days in a row and seemed to revive the dandelions somewhat.After 2 weeks, I would say the product only killed about 2 percent of the dandelions and didn't seem to do anything to other weeds.I would not buy this product again as it is a waste of money."
5,For a good time....,"Hey!!! This is one of the most fantastic bands I've heard in a loooong time. Literally ""music to my ears"", new, refreshing, kickin', a get you off your butt good time! It might take a little searching but check out ""Soul Graffiti""-- the guys newest addition to their album productions. If you are looking for a new sound-- you'll appreciate this fantastic talent."
2,Title is correct! For dummies,Basic cooking instruction. Looking for good bread recipes to make in a big old iron pot. I know how to do it...wanted to see what other recipes could me adapted this way.
3,Good reference,"Didn't care much for the recipes I've tried. However, it's an invaluable book for learning how to care for your cast iron cookware."
3,Good for beginners,This is a good book for some one who has never owned a piece of cast iron cook ware or are considering buying some. It contains some very useful information in it including the selection types styles and brands. It also is very good about explaining the care and feeding of cast iron cook ware and cooking conversion tables. That is helpful.However the recipes both quantity and type are a bit disappointing.If you are trying to learn about this type of cook ware this is a good book for you but if you are seeking new recipes I think there are better books to be had.Dean
4,Still Reading,"I have not been able to get through this book totally as yet, but have found it to be interesting to where I have read."
4,Cast Iron Cookbook,"I thought this would be a nice cookbook to have since I am new to cast iron cooking. I found I really have not used it though.I seem to just make things on my own, but there are a couple recipes I'd like to try sometime."
4,Cooking for dummies,A lot of good advise on taking care of cast iron and redoing old abused cast iron but was kinda dispointted with the recipes.
5,Must have book,"This is a must have book for anyone even thinking of using cast iron in cooking.It list the differen types of ovens, either dutch type and camp style. It shows many of the sizes, and how to care and maintain them, plus wonderful meals to cook using cast iron.Another thing I like about Amazon they also have these pots available, plus many other products used in cast iron cooking.This book can be a good source fo both beginners and long time cooks.Plus, this is a must read in case you have not purchased any cast iron products, as they are not cheap and would be a shame to spend all that money and find you aren't that interested in spending a little extra time in carying for them.If you don't you will have a pot full of rust."
5,Love this book!,"I love this book. I bought it after I received a dutch oven as a gift, and then thought, now what do I do with it? I've now discovered the world of braised meats, and I may never be the same again. The book give a great overview of seasoning and caring for your cast iron, and then delves into the recipes. I highly recommend it."
4,Get's you started,"If you are new to cast-iron cooking, this is a good book. It get's you to cooking and you feel pretty confident that you are doing the right things with the product. How to season, re-season and maintain are some of the important items for me, and they cover those topics very nicely. Good recipes as well, it is nice that they give you an education on how to treat certain meats, and even go into a basic butchery and food prep 101 for the novices in cooking."
2,YIKES,"This film was garbage, plain and simple. It did not have the gore to make up for its weak story line. It did not have enough sex to make up for its lack of gore. There was not enough nudity to shock in place of gore and sex....YIKES!I guess I am twice as bitter, because I bought this DVD sight unseen. It does not even have any camp value. The closest thing I can compare it to is an ABBA video gone horribly awry."
2,Poor resolution; poor controls,"The vcr uses ""auto tracking"" for every tape that you insert... even ones recorded on this VCR?!?! The picture is pretty grainy... even when playing recordings made with this vcr?!?!Not much information is given in the LED display. If you are playing a tape, you can't see the time. You can't tell if the power is on, as there is no indicator, the LED just gets slightly brighter.'Precision' fast forwarding can't be done. The ""flash rewind"" is handy when you want to rewind a movie, but trying to move a tape along 5 minutes or a half hour is like parallel parking a harrier jet. It constatnly overshoots your intended tape position.For about the same price, you can get the Sony SLV N77. It is a much better vcr."
3,very cheaply made,for the price they sounds very good but made in china whit the cheapest parts.hope they will last a while. i used them to get a better sound out of my very bass heavy home stereo.
3,can u hear me,needed more treble bcuze of way to much bass got 3 pair of them only have one set going at the momment and sound great can hear my highs again thanks pyramid
2,bold watch,"i get lot of comments on this rugged watch it has a great look,the only problem i had was the second hand stop working once and had to fix it,but its v eyecatchy"
2,Used crap from goodwill,"This was crap, heavly used, looks like from goodwill, even had price of .99 writen on the outside in black crayon. Its an old school instruction book, maybe for culinary students, on how to make a sauce, and pasta from scratch. I made one dish, look like baby poo. Not recommended for anyone."
2,Didnt like them,"I read many reviews for this sandal and thought I would give them a shot even though they were a bit pricey. There were parts that were comfortable, but overall I just found them to be sort of flat and non responsive. I know they are just a sandal what can you expect?...I just needed something that has a bit more bounce in the sole. So I returned them and opted for some Adidas Sliders and am happy with my purchase."
2,is what it is,"It is alright, will service your needs for a quick look up but I was a little disappointed overall with this product. Will keep it for when I go to bible studies as a quick reference but feel it could have been more through in its lists of bible references."
3,It's Okay,It said this book had a lot of information but when I was searching for a phrase it did not have it. Words was in smaller print .
5,A great gift for little ones!,I gave this book plus a tea set to my two year-old niece for her birthday. She loves the book and wants to hear more about Miss Spider. It was a really great gift.
5,Great for young ages!,"We've been reading this to our little guy since he was three months old, if even that, and he was glued to it from the start, easily his favorite book, still, at nearly 13 months. Great color, great rhythm, and lots of fun bugs! :)"
5,great book,"Our 2 year old daughter loves books and she really loves this book. She asks for it all the time. I can't count the number of times I have read it. To keep myself engaged I have to read it using different voices/accents. Tonight I read it using kind of a country/western twang. She loved that and spontaneously said ""I love you Daddy"". The story is good and the drawings are pleasing."
5,Miss Spider is Wonderful!,"A friend gave this book to my daughter. She loved it the first time I read it to her. I loved it too. The illustrations are amazing! They really keep the reader's attention. You get so involved in the story of Miss Spider and the tea party she almost doesn't get to have,that you don't realize you are learning to count. It is a great book to read in a classroom."
5,I love miss Spider!,"The ""Miss Spider"" books are pretty easy reads. Nice stories, wonderfully bright, and imaginatively styled illustrations!My 3 year old is a little concerned with spiders in general and I think by giving a sweet personality to a spider, it helps to take the edge off of the spiders we may find in the house and in nature."
2,Miss Spider's Tea Party,"Our daughter was enjoying the game until the ant maze. She became so upset and started crying when the ant frantically states it was lost and was going to be late for the party. This game was not very encouraging.I would not recommend this game if you have a child who likes more positive reinforcement than, oh no I am lost or going to be late ( and in their interpretation it is all because of them.)"
4,Smart,"Works much better than another brand that I have. Adjustment is much less picky, on when I want on, off when I want off. I have it on a Media Center PC, turn off the computer, everything goes off. Shipping was fast, and the price was good."
3,very harsh cloth,the cloth is very rough; there is no way you can wear this and sleep or even wear it for 1 hour for that matter!I was sent the wrong size too and the customer service is terrible and u will have to write many e-mails to get just 1 reply from them!
5,Excellent book,"I read this book shortly after reading RA Salvadore's Dark Elf series. This was the first book I've read from Elaine Cunningham. I was thoroughly impressed with her work. This book captured my attention from beginning to end. Since then, I've read many other Elaine Cunningham novels and also loved her other works. She's become one of my favorite authors."
3,"Actually, it's quite entertaining ...","... granted that in the end, it's still light reading. But one thing I'd like to say that I didn't notice anyone else saying is this: for ME, at least, Liriel seemed real where Drizzt never did. I could never make myself believe that someone could grow up so uninfluenced by his society as he. I didn't buy it. Liriel, by contrast, demonstrates time and again that her upbringing has very much influenced her outlook and behavior, despite the fact that she's still a rogue drow."
4,Almost as good as the first,"I like this book a lot, but I felt it lacking the normal action I would expect from a good Drow book. I understand that Liriel was trying to become a force of good/light, but I prefer the more ""evil"" Drow concept. However the book was satifying and I enjoyed it."
2,Not too fun for baby,"This toy wasn't played with very much. Did not hold my childs attention, or even catch it, for that matter. I also didn't like it because somehow water got into them and there was constant condensation in it after a a while. I was worried about getting mildew and mold inside so I tossed this toy."
1,Don't Get This Toy,"Do not even ""think"" about getting this toy. The balls are very, very hard -- way too hard for children over 1 (as recommended), and resulted in an injury for my family on the very first use. I bought it because I assumed it would be safe, being put out by Baby Einstein, but really, I can't believe this product is actually being sold."
5,Very pretty,"Has a subtle, pleasant design and goes well with Spode tableware. OK, I cut off the silly tassles. I am not a tassle kinda guy. But this looks great on a Xmas-themed table."
5,Beautiful!,"This Lenox Holiday Runner looked very pretty on my kitchen table this past Christmas! I was very pleased with it, and I thank you for carrying it Amazon!"
3,Way too long for dining room table and seams were uneven,"This runner is not as attractive as the matching tablecloths and tree skirt. Some seams were uneven and the length was too long for a typical dining room table. Sadly, I returned it."
5,"Wild, Swashbuckling Fun! Also Amazing History Lesson","I saw this author when she came to read in LA, and she said that it was going to be her mission to make sure people knew about Grace O'Malley as much as William Wallace and Robert Bruce. This book should do it -- especially since Grace O'Malley was much more successful than either of those guys! Besides being really fun, with lots of swashbuckling adventure and romance and a terrific, powerful, witty heroine, this book tells a little-known dark story about the great Elizabeth I: her behavior toward the Irish. It's a very satisfying novel and would make a great Christmas present!"
2,Needs another Edit,"The book starts with the mention of twenty or names of various courtiers. It suffers from what many history books suffer - too many names and facts. This is a novel - the story of three people: Elizabeth, Devreux and Grania.The portrait of Elizabeth rings true, but not that of Grania. She speaks like a tough from Dublin, not a gentlewoman of the west of Ireland. Likely that characterisation arises from the fact that she is called a pirate in English records, She and her family were Gaelic-speaking. The author seems unaware of how different she was perceived in the Gaelic world - then and now."
5,Interesting angle on history.,I very much enjoyed this novel. I have always been a fan of pirate lore and this novel combined both English monarchy as well as some wonderful pirate history. It was very well written and the story flowed wonderfully!
2,i didn't finish it,"i got this book anticipating adventure, excitement.. something. two powerful and notable women from english history are coming together, there's potential for a great story. instead this book was written like a documentary... a very slow paced documentary. i lost interest after the first couple of chapters but dragged myself to the halfway mark, and at that point i could care less about the characters and wasn't at all involved in the story line, so dropped it for something better. history is such a fascinating topic but is destroyed for a lot of people by teachers who make it very much less than it should be. because of my expectations, this book was the equivalent of that teacher.as i didn't like it, i suppose i could see how someone could get something out of the book... not too much, but something, so i didn't give it a one, but this isn't my ideal for a good fiction book."
3,fighting irish,wasn't that crazy about the book. had trouble believing the fact that the queen would be so fascinated spending a great deal of time with her enemy listening to her tales.
1,This is a trashy novel,"As an O'Malley I was looking forward to reading a historical novel about one of my ancestors. True, it is about Grace O'Malley, however, it is first and foremost a trashy novel. I've not read the other novels in this series, but I wouldn't take the chance that my time and money would be wasted again on a trashy novel containing material not suitable for the consumption of ladies and gentlemen."
5,Great Addition,This passenger car was a great addition to our Bachmann Santa Special HO Scale Electric Train Set. The only wish I had was that it lighted up. But for the price it is great.
5,This is one of my favorite Billy Joe Royal albums!,I get chills listening to this CD. Billy Joe has one of the most beautiful and interesting voices I've ever heard. Mix that with some great songs and you get this incredible album.
4,Audio bible,This book is a must for sound engineers.Very well written.Different experts covers different subject.It should be consider the bible for all audio lovers.Advices are very useful in such a complex science.I am sure you will enjoy the reading.
3,the classic reference - but now too old - double classic?,i have used this book in the *past*it was the classic with all the info you coudl ask forback then it was 5stars plusnow howeverit (2nd edition) is badly dated and barely worth 3 stars(it would be fewer stars except that it is so complete and some things do not change like the basics of acoustics and hearing etc)why cant i find the third edition listed at amazon ?and now there is a rumored 4th to come out real soon now.wait for the 4thif they don't gut it like happens to so many later editionsto save money by making it smallerthenbuy it and enjoy it for a long timeit will serve you well.
5,Exactly!,"Sabrina pinpoints everything we feel, yet don't say. When I found this book, I was at the same point in my life as Sabrina was when she wrote it. I felt like I'd found somebody who ""got it."" This book is inspiring and beautiful. I've recommended it to every girl I know, and I've read it so many times that I've stopped counting. Sabrina Ward Harrison is a treasure! Read everything of hers you can get your hands on!"
5,I NEVER PASSED ALGEBRA,A book that changes lives. This is truely a masterpiece and in the same order as the Little Prince should be read by everyone! I read it on the way up to Oakland to visit the CCAC campus...and completely realized to stick with myself.....and my art mission....to never give up....that we all feel mucky somedays...and we're not alone. Thank you Sabrina.....YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS BOOK!
3,self-indulgent yet still somewhat compelling...,"I feel some ambivalence about this book. While Ms. Harrison strikes me as visually astute and even at times inspired, the psychotic ramblings and ""disturbed-looking"" handwriting get tiresome in short order. Is banality justified in the name of ""honesty""? I'd hope that young people would manage to find a more articulate and AWARE role-model!? To date I've appreciated Sark's work, but Ms. Harrison is a mite too ""precious"" and undisciplined for my taste."
2,Over-rated,"Perhaps it is my age but I find this loose art unattractive. The book made me dizzy, not something I want in a book on art."
2,Too Confusing...,"I am usually a big fan of this type of book. I have bought many of the SARK books for myself and for gifts and hoped that this would follow along those lines. Unfortunately it does not. After skimming through it, I've decided to return it. I can appreciate it's ""artsy"" look & feel, but it's very difficult to read. Very disappointing - especially after reading all the great reviews!"
1,"this is ""muck!""","i saw better journals, writing and artwork when i was in art school. what i could actually make out was repetive and inane. at lease 50% of it is quotes from actual talented people. i can't believe this crap was published!"
2,Not for me,I know people love this book but it did nothing for me. It seemed purile and whiny. There was nothing insightful in this book - it was just ramblings and complaints about how hard life is. The art work wasn't very good either - it was just random collage. I just don't understand what all the buzz is about with this book. I sent it back.
4,Wonderful!,"Yes, the fonts are hard to read sometimes - but I think if you sit down and read it thoroughly and carefully, you will benefit from this book. I am the same age as Sabrina, too, and this book hits the nail on the head of what inner emotions battle. RECOMMENDED!"
5,the best animation resource I've ever seen.,This is te best animation resource I've ever seen. Specially if you are a beginner in this area. You must see this.
5,Best animation book out there.,"I needed this book for my Traditional animation class and its been SO helpful. When it came down to the breaking down (redundant) of inbetweens and timing this book is great. I couldn't have done my run cycle or my walk cycle without it... and the ball bounces! Plus, it's written bu the guy who did ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" How can you go wrong? Great book."
5,"This book is amazingly helpful, yet simple, and it is quite big","I do not know what else to say but that this book is very insightful. Richard Williams talks about how he started out and what the professionals (lead animators from disney and warner bros) he trained under were like and how the business really was. He talks about other animated films besides his own such as bambi, jungle book, and the beatles yellow submarine featured film.Then he goes on to explain and illustrate the flow of all kinds of movements. This book is just really great.I highly suggest it."
5,"very informative, a must-have for animators","this is THE book to have for animation, it covers all the basics and is easy to understand and easy to use."
5,The best animation book EVER,"There is no question about it. Richard Williams is da man.This book is for everyone who wants to learn animation. I mean REALLY learn animation.Tons of illustration, fun and intuitive reading, it's a must have for everyone who loves animation. I just love this book."
5,The Animator's Survival Kit,"This is a 'must have' for all kinds of animation, 2D and 3D. There is so much information, and if you can get the videos as well, they are excellent. I will use this book for years I am sure."
3,Over sold by the title,"First gripe is this book is only about cell animation, I suppose is an abstract way it would be help full to ""Computer, Games, Stop Motion, and Internet Animators"", but practically speaking there isn't much here that would help.Second, more of a tips and ideas book, calling it a 'survial kit' is melodramatic. It is a bigger, more expensive version of Prestion Blair's book 'Cartoon Animation' so if you have that one, you will be getting double of the same info."
2,Just a college textbook...,"I bought this book as it was a required text for my Animation 101 course. While it's interesting because it was written (and drawn) by the creator of Roger Rabbit, it's quit boring if you are not enthusiastic about animation. It focuses on drawing techniques to help cel animation, but does not touch on any computer animation which is why I gave it 2 out of 5 stars.If you are a serious artist interested in cartoons, live drawings, and animations, this book is a great reference tool. (Especially for creating walking sequences.) For those of you like me who prefer creating things on the computer, you'll be disappointed."
1,I wouldn't recommed this book to anyone,Animation is now done in 3-D this book is dated.The book I have on by Don Bluth were much more elaborate on the animnation process then this book. The drawings are primative and don't offer much of the way of substance you can take them at face value.If you like stick figures you might like this book.
4,"If you like normal animation, you must have it",If you like normal animation and if you like 3d animation or if you like stop motion animation...you'll find all information needed and much more inside this unique book!
5,She Love It,I got it for my fiance for her birthday (she's very interested in animation) and she loves the book.
5,For the love of knitting: A celebration of the Knitter Art,"As usual, very pleased with my order. Book in perfect condition.Susan Ranello"
3,Get the facts straight . . .,"Whenever I find a factual error in a non-fiction book, I immediately begin to wonder what other errors are in it, and I tend to mistrust the book altogether. Toward the end of For the Love of Knitting, there is a nice piece on Elizabeth Zimmerman, Schoolhouse Press, and Meg Swansen. However, the author tells us that Mrs. Swansen continues to run the company with her husband Chris. Chris Swansen passed away many years ago--any knitter with any knowledge of this family would know that! That oversight completely turned me off the book, and I gave it away."
4,Excellent Book For CA 1 & 2,An excellent book for CA 1 & 2. It is easy to read and covers the most important aspects of diseases & relevant information to pass the boards. Another highlight of the book is the tables.
5,great for boards,The combination of Board Stiff and this book helped me pass the boards. Very well written with good board like questions. I outlined each question. The information that was not covered in the cases i used jenson and morgan.
2,Archaic,This could be a useful book if it were up to date. I did like the way the book was structured though. How about some really challenging case scenarios in the future? Check out the FANZCA Part 2 exam questions for some ideas!
2,More non-fiction than fiction,"When I first saw the premise for this book, I was excited about reading it. A story about Oxford right after the time of the Inklings! Why hadn't I heard of this book before? After I began reading the book, I realized why.The story is told to you, instead of letting you experience it. The characters and the plot were a bit predictable, even Mary Sue and Gary Stew-ish. After reading 1/3 way through, hoping the story would begin to flow, I gave up and just read the last three chapters. This book could have been half the size and perhaps been a better read.The good part was learning about the Inkling, C.S. Lewis and Tolkien especially. Those parts were great, making me think that perhaps this book should have been a creative non-fiction account of the author's personal discovery and research of the Inklings. I won't be reading the rest of this series, unless someone convinces me that the writing has improved.One star for a good premise, one star for research."
4,A MUST READ,"If you are a history buff, CS Lewis fan, interested in visiting England, a teenager, a parent of a teenager, or just want to curl up with a good book, than you should read this book. I enjoy reading historical novels because I get both a good story as well as real history. I really believe this book should be a requirement of all teenagers approaching the dating age. It gives them a good perspective and guidelines of how a serious relationship should be handled, and although it may seem a bit idealistic, it's definitely not impossible. I ANXIOUSLY await the sequel. I do hope it's out SOON!"
1,Save Your Money,"I bought this thermometer to replace the ear thermometer that we have, because it's getting hard to find the probe covers for it (it's an older model). Basically, I did several baseline tests on myself to see about the accuracy. This thermometer said 96.2, the digital oral thermometer we have said anywhere from 96.8-97.2 (these were done over the course of about a day and a half).Then, this weekend, my 2-year old daughter started running a fever. I used the ear thermometer on her and got readings of about 99.8-100.0. This thermomoeter? Still 96.2. I haven't ever gotten a reading besides 96.2 for either of us, so I think that must be the only thing it is programmed to say. Don't waste your money on this one. I don't know if I can take it back since I opened it, but I'm going to see if I can get my money back."
1,VERY inaccurate,"I am a Medial Doctor. I have familiarity with many types of thermometers. While the newest fad is temporal artery thermometers, some work well and some don't. This one DOES NOT. It is very inaccurate, not even close. So what else do you need to know. A thermometer which doesn't measure temperature accurately is worthless. Here are some examples of some repeated measurements on the same person: 102, 100, 99. In reality this person was 97.8. I would recommend the EXERGEN brand. I know their $400 model works well, I haven't tried the cheaper home model."
1,not-so-great thermometer,I purchased this thermometer while pregnant with my 4th baby in hopes that it would be quicker than a standard thermometer. The first time I needed to use it I opened up the package only to find that it didn't work at all. Upon calling the company I learned that it would take several weeks to get a replacement and they required me to ship them the defective one before sending out my new (hopefully functioning)unit. I would not buy another Safety 1st product. This is the 3rd product I have purchased and had to send back. Bad return policy.
1,"Inaccurate, difficult to use and a waste of money","I bought it at a pharmacy, had them open it to check the accuracy with the temp that was just taken by the doctor. It took two adults to figure out how to get it to work and when we did, it was off by more than 2 degrees. When you have a baby with a temp of 103.6, you don't want a thermometer that tells you the baby's temp is 101. And that was the highest temp we could get. Some of our tries came up with 98 and even 96. What a waste of time and money."
4,Great thermometer if you need Frequent Readings,"At one and 1/2 years old, our daughter started experiencing complex febrile seizures. To anticipate spikes in fever, we needed to take her temperature frequently. The accu-touch has been a god-send to help me and my wife do this easily, even when she's sleeping. We can see if she is ok, or if a fever is coming on. It may not be as accurate as rectal or ear. However, we've found that it has given us good indications when she has is coming down with a fever, and allowed us to monitor her frequently and easily."
1,Save your money,"As a mother of a child with requent ear infrections I was stoked to find a non-invasive way to take her temperature... UGH! Forget it this thermometer is unreliable, inconsistent, and a pain to use. Save your money!"
2,Love the concept but this one is no good!,"Don't waste your time.PROS -* NONE!CONS -* Takes forever to get a ready from a little noggin that is constantly trying to get away.* Is never correct! We tested it by taking our forehead temperatures over and over again in the same place on our foreheads and never got the same reading. We also tested it by getting a rectal temp. on our 10mth old with regular thermometer, and then using this one and it was way off.* Pediatricians do not recommend these types of thermometers due to inaccuracy.* Just plain hard to use!"
5,Laugh at ALL THE HOLIDAYS YEAR ROUND,"This was my favorite birthday present. Not only did I laugh till I almost wet myself, but the food is wonderful. And the good thing about the book is that regardless of how the title makes it sound, this is not just a Christmas book, but rather a book that covers all the holidays. Even if you don't cook, you will still fall in love with Ruby Ann and all her friends at the High Chaparral Trailer Park. She really has a way of making you forget your troubles. I went out and bought her first book so now I am ready both at the same time, and I'm falling in love with all the people in her books. Where shes comes up with these stories, I'll never know. I hope that she continues to write, because with all the talk of war and such, this is what we need to escape the world we live in. Keep up the great work Ruby Ann Boxcar!"
1,Had it's moments and it's creative....but,"...it isn't one you'll ever read a second time. I'm glad others got something from it, but mostly the cover is the best part."
5,Ms Tatlock's work is of the highest literary quality.,"It should be noted that ""A Room of My Own,"" was awarded the 1999 Angel Award from the Hollywood group, Excellence in Media."
1,Doesn't work,"I would avoid this stuff. It doesn't work. I spent hours gluing rhinestones onto a t-shirt (and yes, I did pre-wash the shirt before gluing on the rhinestones) into the shape of my school's logo. I wore the shirt to the football game, it looked great, got all kinds of compliments. I just washed the shirt -- in gentle, in cold water. About a hundred of the two hundred rhinestones fell off in the washer. I am so angry right now. So the bit about ""holds jewels permanently through repeated washings"" isn't true. I used to decorate shirts with rhinestones on a fairly regular basis, never had this issue before with the other brands I used. This is the first time I've use this particular brand of glue, I bought it because the bottle was small and only wanted enough for this project. Big mistake on my part."
3,Landscaping For Dummies,"A very informative tome, but I think its tries to achieve too much in what is a rather large and varied subject. Should focus on the basics.............but to be fair still an excellent guide"
1,I'm a Dummie for buying this book,Did not tell me what I needed to know to pick plants for my yard. I found most of what I needed in Sunset's Western Garden Book (I'm in the western US).
5,excellent video player,"I carried this thing around the world for several years. It was a great player then and is still going strong. I don't use it as much these days, but it still plays lots of formats and is handy to have if all the tablets are in use! I would buy this or another archos product again."
5,The best,"The first and the best. I've probably listened to this album a million times from beginning to end, and never get tired of it. This is one of my favorite albums of all time."
5,Mary&#65533;s best. No questions asked.,"Sorry, but this one kills all of Mary's other releases. The hits ""Real Love,"" ""Reminisce,"" ""Love No Limit,"" and ""My Love"" speak for them damned selves. `Nuff said."
5,This album is tight!!!,"Who doesn't have this album? And if you don't you are missing out!!! Mary J. has plenty of songs to keep heads bouncin. And she does a good job with Chaka Kahn's ""Sweet Thing."" One of the best R&B albums of the 90s!!!!!!"
4,Emotional Hook Up,This CD is off the chian. It relax you on a day of hard work and head aches. Anyone how is everyone can enjoy this CD or at least one song.
4,Really like........,"This is a good cd, she really puts a lot of love in her music and it comes though on this. :)"
5,She's still got it goin' on.,"In 1992, Mary J. Blige introduced a music form known as hip-hop soul. She along with her producers Sean (P. Diddy) Combs and Andre Harrell made singing a part of Hip-Hop culture and transformed Hip-Hop and R&B. You Remind Me, Love no Limit, Changes I been going through, Sweet Thing, and I don't want to do anything will make you groove. Real Love is the best track."
3,Dive Rite Slate,"It's the right size and functions, however the plastic clip broke the very first time I pulled it back. If you plan on replacing the clip with brass or SS it'll do you fine."
3,"Engaging, yet tiring","Okay, I read the whole series so far and enjoyed it. IMHO, the first two books were the best. This one leaves too many loose ends, and what with Ms. Flewelling writing the Bone Doll series I doubt they'll get resolved.Also, I confess I eventually got tired of the innumerable plot twists and ""oh oh, they have to solve crisis #427 or they're all dead!"" It actually reads like she was taking notes at the last 10 Dungeons and Dragons gaming sessions she hosted or something.Still, refreshing ideas, and decent writing (and some truly funny moments) make up for a lot. And it's still better than anything Robert Jordan, that charlatan, ever wrote."
4,Another great one!,"Another great book in the Nightrunner series, wonderful, but I didn't love it as much as the first two. Still, I highly recommend it. Alec and Seregil are very cute together. I just love them ^^ It definitely leaves some loose ends hanging though... I hope another one comes out soon!"
3,Seregil and Alec are Back,"I have been haunting the book stores waiting for this book for 2 years. Finally! It was worth the wait. I was interested in seeing where Ms. Flewelling would take us that would be new and I was not disappointed. We /and Alec finally get more information on Seregil's past and the new country has the intrigue we've come to expect. I don't think it's quite as good as Stalking Darkness, but then again, I'm a sucker for angst. You can't beat the end of SD for angst. P.S. Three stars is good for me. I tend to rank against other authors. G.G. Kay is a five. P.S.S. Reading the reviews here made me happy. The homophobes stayed away. Good riddance."
4,Fast Paced Fun Read,I have read the first two books in this series. The plot moved quickly. I was never bored. I can not wait to finish the last book.
3,Neverending story....,"Altough I've loved the first two Nightrunner books,I've lost patience whit this one.Seven hundred pages of bickering and negotiations are too much.I hope in Nightrunner number four."
1,stop.,"So boring. I loved the first one, thought the second was pretty good, but this book was painful from start to finish. Not a single interesting thing occurs, if you read the first two, stop there. Unfortunately now im left with a sour taste in my mouth and have no interesting in picking up any of the later books in the series."
2,Two out of three ain't bad,"This book didn't cut it. Too contrived for my taste, and unlike the first 2 books, there was some real slow going. This series should have stopped at 2 books--there really wasn't more to tell, and Sergeril's homeland just isn't enough to fill a book. Still, check out the first 2 books and read some really good fantasy with a nice take on the orphan boy plot device."
3,Good book-please edit more in future!,"I am enjoying this series on my Kindle, but I would enjoy it WAY more without the many typos! As far as typos go, this is the worst Kindle book I've ever read. They are awful! Many words that are supposed to have 'th' have 'm' instead ('man' instead of 'than', etc.). It took me a while to figure out why there were Haitians (Haman is the name of one of the clans in the story) in a fantasy novel. Also, 'viceregent' is misspelled 'vicegerent' all through the book. Character names are filled with constant typos, too. 'Alec' is often 'A lee' and 'Ilar' (Iliar? I really can't tell) is 'liar' almost throughout. I don't expect a book to be perfect, but this was just awful. Please, whoever edited this needs to retire their spellchecker! I am hoping that I shouldn't expect such sloppy editing from Kindle editions."
2,It wasnt the best,I loved the first two books but this third one bothered me. In fact I read 100 pages and put the book down. It was boring. I hated Sergil and Alec's relationship. To me it made Alec seem more like a support character to Sergil. Alec is my favorite character but this book has made me think twice.
1,Dull,"I expected more from the series. The first two installments where incredible, but this last one leaves much to be desired. I could care less about how much Alec and Seregil love each other; yes it is good character development, but Lynn Flewelling takes it to far. Where is the action, the suspense, and the character development. Alec's big secret past is anything but a surprise, the whole novel reads like a bad Nancy Drew novel. I was very disappointed, the only redeeming aspects where the characters, and even they are weak in this installment. The whole thing is DULL, DULL, DULL."
2,DVO Cook'n Deluxe 6.0,"So far, I have had a number of problems with this product, beginning with attempts to register it. Some windows, including the registration window and info windows such as the ingredient/analysis window, truncate the info so that the entire field cannot be read. There appears to be no way to view all of the info. I have even tried to change screen resolution to no avail. This is the only program I have ever entered that had this problem. I am using Windows XP Home on that computer. The phone support person could not help and said I could return the product if not satisfied. I have not yet given up on it, but am close to returning it. I will be happy to change this review if this problem can be solved, hopefully with the publisher's help."
2,DVO Cook'n Deluxe 6.0 - Ultimate Recipe Organizer,Not what I expected. It works ok but I have used better programs
2,"Good Software, poor support","Were it not for the glitches, this would be a great piece of software.My main complaint is that each time I update it with their latest software (which includes new recipes), instead of overwriting the existing recipes, it simply adds them again. So, after the installation and two updates, I now have 3 of every recipe.This is annoying on many levels. I've contacted customer support and their seeming automaton tells me to update to the latest version. Well...that's what is causing the problems.I'm a Microsoft engineer so I'm not computer-stupid. The software has some serious flaws.Buy at your own risk."
1,Does this make sense?,"The software allows you to add pictures into the recipe database. Sound like a good idea right!! But there is no way to view the pictures with the recipe or to print them out. My goal was to keep our recipes organized, but also to print them and have them in a binder. Having a picture of the meal you are cooking is very useful, but not possible with this software.Save you money, don't bother with this software."
1,What's the recipe for fatal error?,Could not install this software on ANY of my computers. I will not buy anything related to the company EVER!!!!!!! I only rated this 1 star because I had to.
1,sales good/ followup very bad,I bought this program in 4/2/2010. It worked fair. on 9/28/2010 I bought the organizer 9. It worked so bad that I stopped fooling with it. Several weeks age I re- installed everything.It will not accept the other programs in the master program. The only support is on-line. I e-mailed them after #9 didn't work months ago. They never responded. I think the program is a rip off. I'm tired of being ripped off by companies like this. SHAME ON YOU DVO. I hope this costs you many sales.
2,Beware--they do not honor the 200% guarantee they claim,"The video tutorials are great. The program is average compared to others out there.My biggest peave is that, after trying a number of programs, I found one I liked better. Dan Oaks refunded only my purchase price--NOT THE 200% HE CLAIMS HE WILL DO. He continues to ignore my emails."
1,Don't bother purchasing DVO Cookin' software.,"I do not recommend this product. I have spent a lot of time putting in my own recipes and pictures, and then they just disappear after a while. I try it again and again it happens that my recipes are gone, the only ones I can find are the crappy ones DVO puts on there. The interface is outdated, antiquated, and clunky-not to mention aesthetically unappealing. The software is unreliable, don't waste your time with it. I have wasted my time with it and I regret it. Save your money and wait until something decent is developed for recipe organizing. Seriously."
1,Mindless Chatter,"I'm sorry to say this book is a total flop. No Story, No indepth characters, and Nothing that can hold the readers interest. So boring I quit reading about half way through. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."
2,Where's the romance?,"I read this book because of a review that lauded its humor and style. The only reason it has 2 stars is for the humor and quick pace. There was no romance, no conflict between the hero and heroine except that the hero, Chase, seemed to be the biggest idiot with the largest chip on his shoulder even for the people who helped him. Sure he was sent away by his employers, but hey, he got a fully paid college education out of it. And the people at the house, the other servants that helped raise him? Forgets about them, even when he returns to visit his father. Everything was resolved entirely too quickly and in a truly unbelievable way.I won't be reading another Lynn Michaels book."
1,Item does not match description,"BEWARE! Item does not correspond with description, photo or reviews.Listing name is ""Tacony Corporation Madeira Bobbinfil thread 1500 Meters - White"", but product description, photo and reviews indicate that product is 18 spools of different colored threads. I ordered based on description, photo and reviews, but received a single white spool of thread. I returned the single spool asking for the 18 spools as a replacement, but after corresponding with Amazon.com's customer service by e-mail, was informed that they'll be re-sending the same single white spool. Apparently the listing's item name is correct, but nothing else.I will have to refuse that shipment when it arrives and request a refund. $22 for one spool of thread is not appropriate. Hopefully Amazon will fix this listing."
1,read title carefully,"What I got in the mail was ONE spool of WHITE thread for $28, not a collection of threads like the picture shows! It's being returned."
1,Not what I expected,The colors were ok. They were way smaller than what I expected. I don't really order things on line and now I remember why you never get what you are expecting. I tried to return them to a local JoAnn's and they would not take it. I was very disappointed. You are better off purchasing them at a local store they are cheaper and you don't have to pay shipping. They were over priced for what you get.
2,Weak Water Flow,I took a chance and ordered this shower head even after reading the above review because the water pressure in my house is terrific. However it's not good enough for this shower head even after removing the restrictor. In both normal and massage modes the flow is barely better than a trickle.
5,Surprisingly Good!!,"Frankly, I had low expectations for this DVD but it's excellent! Being from the Seattle (""Jet City"")area, I particularly love the detailed depiction of William Boeing and especially Tex Johnson's famous roll over Lake Washington in the prototype 707. Any aviation nut will love this!"
5,Aviation documentary,"This DVD is an outstanding documentary of two great leaders in the field of aviation. It is a ""must have"" for any aviation enthusiast. It should also be of great interest to history buffs."
4,Pioneers In Aviation,"Excellent DVD. Having grown up in Seattle and living in a Boeing employee family, I really enjoyed the history of Boeing and Douglas. There was so much I never knew. I especially enjoyed the old film footage and still photo shots. I highly recommend, especially for aviation buffs."
2,Returning for Packaging,I have bought every season of South Park from Amazon as gifts for my son. Last year it came in a cheap plastic case so I returned it and bought it locally where it is boxed like the previous seasons. I just received season 15 and it is the same way! I just walked across the parking lot to Best Buy and they have the DVD's in the box like the earlier seasons. I am returning this DVD to Amazon and will buy it across the street for about the same price but better packaging. Since this is a gift it matters to me.
5,Still great after 15 years.,South Park still manages to entertain and amuse after 15 years and in my opinion it keeps getting better. Thanks Matt and Trey for spinning out comedy gold week after week.
1,Won't play on region free DVD player,I love South Park but for whatever reason this one will not play on my region free blu ray player. All other blu rays play regardless of region. What's up with that
1,REGULAR PLACTIC DVD BOXSET,I won't get the collector boxset shown in these pictures. I've received the same ordinary dvd box set after I've returned it the first time. It was even broken during transportation.
1,Received bootleg set that says MADE IN MEXICO,I bought every single season of south park and they all came in big looking cases this one came in single DVD looking case that's says made in Mexico across it.
3,southpark season 15,"Well I got it right away watched the first 2 disc where good but the 3rd one will not work, I hope they will exchange this for me as I collect these seasons and waited for 15 to come out. The disc is dull looks like someone tried to clean it or what ever but will not work. For 27.00 dollars for this I hope I hear back soon sent a report last night waiting to hear back from amazon anyway is is a good season and I do want a copy of it thanks"
1,Deception,"When I got this item I was really upset because the packaging is not the same as shown here. I don't know if it is a cheaper version, but I paid for what AMAZON shows. Instead of getting the picture displayed I got a different one. It still is the 15th season and everything but the package is smaller and I DO NOT LIKE IT. To be honest, one of the reasons why I buy South Park is because their package...I love it and I noticed since the 13th season they put in the market a new stupid looking package which I do not like and it is the one I got. What really pisses me off is the fact that these guys advertise the nice package and give me the other package.....WHAT SHOULD I DO?"
5,Wow....,"I was so happy with this movie! It kept we wondering what will happen next and even when I thought I had it figured out, It would surprise me. This movie is really good... And the characters are amazing.there is the lil guy who is just sooo freaky lookng/scary and the main guy who is just crazy hot! Watch this movie. I loved it and I'm sure you will 2"
1,Save your money and more importantly your time!,"I just got done watching this DVD and boy was it bad. Its hard for me to remember when I watched a movie I disliked this much. My husband agrees. The entire plot could have taken place in less than half an hour and it was about as suspenseful as an episode of Sesame Street. The main actors were probably pretty good, but since I don't speak any Italian I'm not 100% sure, but even good actors/acting still can't save this film. If you like watching foreign films like ""Tod in Venedig"", then go ahead and rent this film, maybe you'll like it and you'll only lose a little money and time but you definitely wouldn't want to buy this one because you aren't going to watch it more than once!"
2,"OK, but not all that strong.","We started using these for both our recycling and trash since we ordered so many. With our trash, the bag strength isn't that important because I just have to get the trash from the kitchen trash basket to the garage trash containe and then I don't care if it breaks. Plus our kitchen trash tends to not be rough, stiff or some other shape that would typically break a bag. For the recycling however it just doesn't work. when we add small boxes (ceral boxes etc), stuff plastic jugs or anything hard and pull the bag out of the kitchen recycling basket to place it in the garage there's a rip every time. I can't even imagine what would happen to these if we placed them directly on the street (which is what we have to do for recycling pick up). I certainly recommend these for waste that won't have sharp/hard edges or anywhere you won't be dragging the bag around a lot, but not for other uses."
2,Fine for the lighter items tear far too easily though and forget anything heavy...,"These tear far to easily, they hardly even handle my recycling bin at home, and normal garbage is far too much for these bags. Still I plan to make it work until I have used them all up but don't count on them for the anything substantial (in size or weight as both things tend to tear or split open these garbage bags). I don't plan on buying these again."
3,Don't Want another Case.,"I bought a case of these bags because they are good for the environment.1. They are very thin, barely make it to the garbage sometimes.2. The ties are so hard to find and don't work well when I do find them, that I usually just tie them up using the excess since they are larger than my can. So essentially I'm only filling them 1/2 to 3/4 full and using the rest to tie a not to keep them closed.3. They are only made of 55% recycled materials, and I thought they would be 100% recycled.Not happy with these bags at all. I'm glad to finally being using them all up and hope the next batch is better."
2,At least they are relatively earth friendly,"The good news is these bags include some recycled content.The bad news is they aren't strong enough for an average household. We don't have anything especially heavy or pointy in our regular garbage and these bags tear every time. They rip again when I remove them from the garbage can. The walk from the garbage can inside to the garbage can outside is not a fun one with a holey bag.To further complicate matters, the twist ties to seal the bags frequently pop off. By that time the full bags are already in the can and it's not a big deal, but geez . . . the only nice thing I have to say is about the recycled content. Considering that other bag brands contain more recycled content and/or are biodegradable and are stronger, that's not such bright spot after all.Most of the bags are still in the box, but I can't stand to use these for the kitchen garbage anymore. I started to use them for clothing donations, but they still rip."
2,Not for heavy stuff,"These bags work pretty well as long as you're not placing heavy items in them. I have three litter boxes that I clean often.Placing the used cat litter in this bag, along with the lighter trash, then trying to pull the bag out of my kitchen trash can to dump it in the outside bin results in it tearing every time. The Glad ForceFlex bags never had this problem."
3,Good for light to medium duty,"I generally love Seventh Generation products. It feels good to buy products that are environmentally friendly, from a company that is responsible. However, these trash bags are not their best item. They are thin and rip easily. I use them only in our diaper pail. (We use Seventh Generation diapers as well, which I highly recommend!) The bags will hold a medium heavy load, as long as you don't have a lot of sharp edges in the bag. The best part about these bags is knowing that they are made from recycled plastic, which is good for our landfills."
1,Bad Bags - Don't Bother,"These are really poorly made bags. They are ultra thin, which means you have to double them up if you don't want a rip. They don't tie well because they are so thin, they rip when you try to cinch them. I bought a case and now wonder what I am going to do with all of these bad bags. I want to be environmentally friendly, but these bags just aren't worth the frustration."
4,"Product was defective, but otherwise good","For the price you really can't beat these, and you're helping save our earth. However, I ordered a case and half the boxes in there were defective - the bags were sealed at the top. Thankfully Amazon has amazing customer service and there was no hassle what-so-ever in getting replacements. The bags are a little on the thin side, but honestly, every other bag I've tried - even those force flex, teflon, etc - all rip. So if the highly-marketed brands are going to rip, why not get these instead and deal with the few rips while protecting our earth a bit!"
5,Great green garbage bags!,"Sure, they are a little pricey but they are just as excellent as any other brand and far far better for the environment. Even if you aren't a person who buys into global warming or whatever, it should be pretty obvious that creating less waste isn't a bad thing..."
3,OK. Biggest thing they are green.,"These are just like regular trash bags. They don't have the convienent little handle cord, and they aren't especially thick, but they work fine for light household work. I am trusting they are less harmful to the planet, so that makes me feel better about using any sort of plastic, convenience product."
3,ok but atleast its good for our enviroment,"The bags are not nearly as good as Hefty but they do what i need it to do. its not wise to overload or put heavy or sharp items. However, I purchase product knowing that I am helping out planet. There is no one else who has a product like this."
1,Not really a trash bag.,"The ""Tall Kitchen Bags"" are not bags in any serious sense. They are tubes of plastic nominally sealed at one end. About half split wide open as soon as you pull them apart to place in the bin. The rest fail when you pull them out of the bin, leaving trash everywhere.I can't think of anything worse for the environment than 30 unusable 2-ply ""bags"" that go straight into a landfill. Add in the money wasted, the mess created, and the time required cleaning up, and you're looking at a truly epic fail."
1,"Poor Quality, So Thin They Break","We just arranged return on case we bought. In normal usage, not heavy items, we've seen five bags break in first package used -- 2 bursting on kitchen floor, before we threw in the towel. The bags are thin, and thinner than other bio bags we've bought, and used for two years, without breakage. These Seventh Generation bags aren't ready for sale; they need the seams strengthened."
2,"Flimsy, cheap bags that are good for the Earth","Buy these because they're recycled, not because they're good bags.No drawstrings, thin plastic, just your standard low-quality trashbag, in recycled form."
1,Smelly,"I have used these bags for years and love that they are made from recycled materials and had no fake scent. BUT when I opened my most recent box it had a chemical scent. I opened all three of the boxes I purchased and they all had a scent. I'm trying to make better choices and get the synthetic chemicals out of my house, and who would think that Seventh Generation would put a chemical scent on their recycled bags? That makes me question the rest of their thinking about green and sustainable. Gotta take a pass on these until they go back to unscented."
3,just a trash bag,"Not very strong...like the idea of recycling though, but there are others out there that are less expensive and the same in other ways."
3,Better for the environment than regular trash bags,"These bags are NOT 100% recycled. However, they are made from 55% recycled plastic, which is still better than regular bags. They are thin bags, they do have a tendancy to rip. My husband finds this very irritating and he is not happy that I bought so many of them, since he takes care of the trash. But, due to the fact that they are better for the environment, I will continue using them and I will buy them again. But they aren't stretchy like other bags, you can't jam them full."
1,So Frustrating,"Seventh Generation Trash Bags, Tall Kitchen, 13-Gallon, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)Thin and poorly made. It's a shame when your trying to be eco-conscious and you run into products like this. Almost everytime we take out the trash we end up rebagging all the trash that ripped through the bottom of the first bag. Even double bagging is not a guarantee that a blow-out will not occur. YUCK! It's so frustrating, not to mention, such a waste to have to double bag everytime. We will not be buying these again, but somehow need to find a way to use all 12 boxes. Suggestions???"
2,Description and item do not match.,"I have purchased two of these WARN 7601 Ratchet Disc, for the WARN M8274 winch. The first time I bought one I actually received the correct item that matches the description but not the picture. The second time I bought one I received the item in the picture which is not a WARN Part number 7601 Ratchet Disc. I have returned the incorrect item with no issues as far as I can tell.Whoever has this listed should police the ads and make sure the description matches the item that is being sold."
4,"Picture is Wrong, Product is Great","Although the picture that is shown on the Amazon website for these cargo locks is wrong, the actual cargo locks are very useful in holding things in place. Simple idea that could be very useful. I can't rate them higher than a 4 yet because I have only had/used them for a couple of days."
5,awesome,"The one thing I don't like about driving a wagon is that anything in the back slides around whenever I go around a corner (driving like a madman). So in the past, I bought giant plastic organizing trays to keep in the back. Sure, that contains things a bit, but THEY SLIDE TOO. So now I have these great little corner blocks. Just like the OEM VW ones, but half the price. So I bought twice as many!"
4,Good for the price,"This article does not give you much flexibility, it has to be either a square or two separated units in a corner. I bought two sets so I could make a larger square in the trunk of my SUV, but them I found out that you cannot as there are no connectors!Still like the product, but would not buy it again, unless Nifty changed the way you can connect them together.brazeagle"
3,AWESOME PRODUCT but wrong color,"I love these things and I did not own any until now. I saw friends with these in their cars and thought they were the best idea. BUT, Do Not Buy them from Amazon unless you want BLACK not Charcoal(gray). Even though they are described as charcoal and labeled as such on the box, black blocks were packaged. Amazon's best answer was, just return them and we'll send you some more. OK replacements showed up and same issue. Contacted Amazon again and the best they can do is ALLOW me to return them and THEN issue a refund. You are then left were you started, with nothing."
2,An Uninspiring Journey to the End of the Book,"With all due respect to the late Professor Cantor, the text needed a moderately interested editor. While amusing factoids and insights occasionally appear in it (though hardly provocative), much of the book reads as well as an undergraduate term paper for an introductory history course. There is a lack of cohesiveness and flow throughout the chapters, which sometimes lose focus. Considering the credentials and past successes of the author, I have to believe that an earlier draft of the book was mistakenly given to the printers. While a succinct piece on Alexander is welcome, this book sadly fails to provide an insightful and satisfying snapshot of the conqueror.In my opinion, if readers are interested in an engrossing psychological examination of the historical Alexander, they would be better served by Michael Woods' documentary and/or companion book."
1,Written by a college freshman?,This is the worst book ever written on Alexander. There are historical inaccuracies on nearly every page. Heresay and universally discounted legend are presented uncritically alongside historically accepted fact.
1,Why was this book written?,"I bought two copies of this book so that my grandson and I could read and discuss it. My two purposes were 1) teach him about Alexander the Great and 2) show him how scholarly history books, as opposed to history text books, are written.This book has served as a good example of a bad example.To be charitable, I see that the copyright belongs to the Estate of Norman Cantor and was published after his death. I will assume that his illness led to the low quality of this book. Otherwise, I must assume he was a piss-poor professor.For the sakes of New York University, Tel Aviv University, and the Rhodes and Fulbright organizations, besides Mr. Cantor's reputation, the Estate should never have published this book in its present form.I am very disinclined to read any other works of Mr. Cantor's."
2,uhhhh..... ok i guess,well over all the product was ok. The problem was they did not include a very important bolt with it. and then the brackets for the side of the front bumper wouldnt work so I now have to take it to a shop and have them make it work some how. besides the missing bolt and the brackets the kit was fine. not to mention the price for shipping was a little expensive for the time frame that it took to get to me but what can you do
5,Everybody's Rockin,"Neil and the ""Shocking Pinks"" are fun , and a break from the serious side of Neil. Rockabilly hilights are really cool. Love it."
3,Quit Whinin'..Here's what i did..,".......Add Bobby Freeman's,Jimmy Reed & Slim Harpo's singles along with selected tracks from Zappa's ""Crusin with Benny & the Jets"" and you got one Cool Crusin' CD....Whaalah.!"
4,Rockin' Neil!,Absolutely unknown side of this old master - Should be in every Neil Young collection if only as a beautiful curiousity. Completely different from all other Young releases - recommended!Everybody's Rockin'
3,For Completists Only,"Neil, Neil... can we talk?You know I love you, man. I bought this on vinyl, then as an import CD, basically 'cuz I'm a completist. I like to have the full Neil Young oevure. But, speaking as a friend, you're waaay out of your element here. Oh, sure, it sounds like you're having a good time and all, but I somehow get the feeling this was an excuse to name another band (i.e., Stray Gators, Bluenotes, International Harvesters, Crazy Horse...but ""shocking pinks""?). That bit about Ronnie and Nancy dancing was the final straw, really. Didn't need that mental image.Do me a favour, will ya? See if you can dig into the archives and re-release ""American Stars and Bars"", ""On the Beach"", or my personal fave, ""Time Fades Away""... I'd rather see the money go to you, old friend.And anything would be better than re-releasing this. You're a genius, no doubt, but this material is beneath you."
3,Rockabilly Neil,"After forging into the future of music on Trans, Neil Young reached back into the past for its follow-up, Everybody's Rocking. The album is a mixture of covers and originals that harkend back to the early rock sounds of the late 50's. Mr. Young seems to be enjoying him self as he lets loose on songs like the funny ""Kinda Fonda Wanda"" and the classic ""Betty Lou's Got A New Pair Of Shoes"". ""Wonderin'"" has a cool shuffling sound and ""Payola Blues"" has some great lyrics. The album isn't the best of his career, but after pushing the envelope with Trans, its fun to hear him kick back and play good old, simple rock & roll."
3,Another odd 80s Album,"As a long time Neil Young fan, I purchased this album in the late 80's on vinyl as one of the final pieces to my collection. I love Neil's quirkiness, and I'm a big fan of Trans, and even (at points) Landing on Water. However, this album is essentially a curio for die-hards, and is not something you're destined to play much. I like Kinda Fonda Wanda and a few others, but get this album after you get all others, except maybe Old Ways or Journey Through the Past (if you can find that on Vinyl).I'd much rather see those old Reprise albums re-released. Particularly On The Beach & Time Fades Away. I think Geffen released Re-Ac-Tor, which is also preferable. One of my all-time favs, ""Shots"" is on that one....but less I digress...."
3,"Not Neil's best, but he did worse","This is one of Neil's many 80s genre expeditions, and, while the songs are upbeat and fun, has very little depth. Neil released it as a payback to David Geffen, his record company exec who insisted he shelve his country project (which became ""Old Ways"") and release a more rock album like ""Rust Never Sleeps."" This is hardly ""Rust Never Sleeps,"" and it resulted in Geffen suing Young for not sounding enough like himself (the latter lost, of course). I've read Neil quoted as saying the above and also as saying that this album is ""as good as 'Tonight's the Night.'"" Trust me, it's not, and he probably knows it, although who am I to judge. If you find this album on vinyl at a garage sale in good condition, by all means grab it. But whether or not it's worth $$$ is a matter of personal opinion. Mine is that, while I dig the music, that much for a 24-minute album is hardly worth the money."
3,he can do anything,"I think that Neil only made this album because David Geffen demanded a ""rock"" record after Trans and the later to be released Old Ways. Geffen even sued Neil for plagiarizing himself. Neil struck back by making a ""rock"" record in its simplest form. The fact that he can make music that was probably half a joke and still make people love it shows his pure genius as a musician. There's nothing Neil Young can't master."
3,One bright spot,"I find it hard to rate this album. I think Wonderin' is fantastic - really catchy (especially coupled with the video), but the rest of the songs are a bit boring and predictable. Dare I say it I actually find most of Neil Young's songs in general boring, and my other favorite song by him is Mr Soul on the Trans album, so I'm not your typical fan.I wish he had kept experimenting, because the ideas have always been there, it's just that his songs haven't always been packaged in the most interesting way (especially from a younger fans point of view)."
4,want to hear more,"dear neil fans, i am trying to find the neil young albums that contained the following songs, one was ""four strong winds"" and the other was a song which had the opening line of ""look ou mamma there's a white boat coming up the river, both of these recordings along with ""the rest of my collections were destroyed in a fire), can anybody help?,my recordings would have been for the uk market..best regards ..Mark...mlruckley@yahoo.com."
4,Too Cute,I love this Jersey! It's only downside is the pound of glitter on it! It gets all over the place but it's the one jersey i can wear with pride!
5,Incredible Food with Little Preparation,"I originally received this as a gift. After using it, I have given all our daughters one for their homes. The recipes are easy to follow, truely use only 4 ingredients and are delicious. It is especially great for working woman who like to cook but don't have a lot of time for preparation."
3,MOVIE LIST,"Since Amazon doeSnt give the movie list i will do it. i bought the item because it seemed nice and not for the movies. Its a nice tin edition at a good price. The movies included, i have never heard of them and must/may be below average.MOVIE LIST:1.GOOD AGAINST EVIL (1977)2.DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT (1973)3.BLOOD TIDE (1982)4.DEATH SCREAMS (1981)5.LAEGACY OF BLOOD (1971)"
2,"Not for vegetarians; clunky, non-intuitive interface","I was looking forward to a product aimed at vegetarians. Somehow, a food listing that includes bacon bits, bacon drippings, and anchovies is missing the point (so far I've only gotten to the B's in deleting non-vegetarian ingredients and recipes). Some people confusedly think eating chicken or fish qualifies them as a vegetarian, so maybe that is the audience this program seeks (although that still doesn't explain the bacon). Earlier I posted my inability to customize nutrition information. A quick response from support showed me how...the information was not located in the manual and was not at all intuitive (and I work in computers all day every day)."
1,Not worth the money,"Unless you need directions for how to make mini-pizzas out of a slice of bread, sauce, and cheese, you'll be better off with another program. Not easy to navigate around, either."
2,Pre Windows95 Software,"The interface is pretty awful. Looks like it was writted for Windows 3.1 (pre Windows95). For this price the interface should have been modernized. Also, you have to put the CD in in order to use it. However, it does do ok at cataloging your own recipes which is what i wanted it for. The recipes already in it are not very vegetarian, using meat, sugar, butter and other stuff. Some are veggie though.Overall, I'm disappointed in the interface, and the fact i have to put the CD in every time i want to use it."
5,Excellent exposition on electromagnetism,"It is hard to understand why this book is out of print.The authors are deceased as far as I have checked.It is extremely well organized and written, logically presented,full of illustrations, examples, figures and exercises.The text covers electromagnetism at a graduate level,but it is so clearly written that you will be able to gainlots of insights even if you have studied only the basics.Some typos are present in the text but they are easy toidentify and correct. I personally enjoy a lot this bookand recommend it thoroughly. It deserves to be reprintedas a revised version."
4,Decent for YES fans & Guitar Fans,"Short release, only a few tunes, but get it if only for Trevor Rabin's solo Solly's Beard. It's the only cd I know of where you'll find it. It's not on the YesYears box-set. What a rippin solo. Other than die-hard YES fans though, not much mainstream appeal to this one. Squire's Amazing Grace was his standard bass solo through the 80's and early 90's. Pretty cool if you've never heard it before."
2,9012 Live - The Solos,"What's going on here?? The best cut is Hold On...Amazing! The druming is incredible. But that's it! All the other songs are nice.I remember seeing the Album in the discount bin in Kmart for $7.99. Yes (pardon the pun) seven dollars. Not a Hundred and seven dollars.Too bad the entire concert or tour (like the video) from this era has never been fully released. Based upon what I have read from fans input, and my own this band incarnation is one (was) of the best."
3,A short snipped of YES history,"This was originally released as a 12"" vinyl EP, due to the sheer demand for new YES product at the time. After the hugely succesful album 90125, the next album Big Generator was very slow in manifesting. So, this mini-album was really a ""stop-gap"" for marketing purposes. Nevertheless, now in 2006, it's an interesting historical excerpt from the YES tour of 1985. The performances are as good as ever."
3,Hmm,"I was really looking forward to seeing how the author wrote this novel as it has a great premise, but the way in which the author wrote it is sadly lacking. I came away thinking that ""this isn't how a Roman general would react"" several times through out the book. The author needed to do more research."
3,LIGHT LUCY FARE,"27 year-old Lucille Ball portrayed a harried and overworked film star who was the victim of countless stunts and tricks employed by her energetic press agent to promote the features she turned out for Wonder Pictures. Lucy plays Annabel Allison, a diminished film star whose bad temper has made her unpopular at the studio. Pompous and fast-talking publicity man Oakie, however, devises a barrage of gimmicks to retain her name before the public.....This little programmer was successful enough for a sequel which was the less successful ANNABEL TAKES A TOUR. With this follow-up, what was going to be a series, met an early demise. Perhaps it was just as well as the downward trend begun in the second film might have continued with subsequent results. As it remains, Ball and Oakie are remembered for having performed in two moderately funny minor efforts which poked fun at bad tempered stars and the harebrains that wrote their puff pieces."
4,I Just Love Lucy In Anything!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I got quite a few laughs out of it. There are a couple of Lucy flicks I like better, so that's why I rated it a ""4"". The first situation, where she is in prison, is a little beyond reality. That is, I can't believe she served so much time. They should have been able to get her out sooner. Anyway, I love to watch the old TV series, but it's refreshing to see Lucy in a different role. Lucy was as good as I expected her to be. And Jack Oakie is as crazy as ever, but I usually enjoy movies he's in as well. I would recommend this movie to any classic movie fan, and if you're a Lucy fan, that just makes it better."
4,Not quite up to the quality control standards of All-Clad...,"This appears to be Calphalon's direct attempt to compete with the Rolls Royce of cookware, All-Clad. Since All-Clad is produced in the USA and this line comes from 'Maoland', you (generally) will not be getting All-Clad quality.The pan was a little shallow compared to other 8"" omelet pans in my collection. This means a little more care must be taken when cooking to avoid spills onto the burner. The inner surface, a not unattractive 'satin' finish, contained a small, but obvious 'ding'. This was not due to the packaging and must have happened during the manufacturing/packing operation. I have to think that All-Clad would not have allowed such a dented pan to escape its plant."
4,A different kind of tour book,"As the sub-title suggests, this is a tour-guide for the land of Maya mysteries, in the Yucatan, and also in neighboring areas. It is delightful and enlightening reading, although some of the information is a little of-of-date (copyright 1987,etc, but the 2004 revised edition didn't catch all the needed revisions). Nevertheless it's worth having for its different slant & abridged information on the sights & the history. The author also includes interesting information,like the possibility that Coba was ruled by a female; see p.102 for more on that. Pack it!"
4,a good primer to good gnosis,"Phillip I feel has been Leloup's best Commentary to date.. full of gems and things to ruminate on.. Where Mary was well.. a bit embellished.. but had some nuggets.. and Thomas wasn't bad , but there have so many commentaries on Thomas.. and have to admit a couple way better than Leloup's.. though i do give it it's due.. In Phillip Leloups simplicity and insightfulness permeates.. I've had this book for at least a couple years now.. and find something else still, when I pick it up"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I like doing workout DVD's and have a good collection of BeachBody programs, Jillian Michaels and 10 Minute Solution workouts. I was looking for something new and I figured a cardio DVD would be great. I was hesitate at the first segment because I didn't feel like I was working anything but then as I added the next few segments I could feel that my body was being worked! Not to mention I was sore the next day. I think this is a good DVD and the instructor is good. I would absolutely get another one of the videos instructed by her. I definitely recommend this one if you want to incorporate a different kind of cardio routine to your workout."
2,"too fast, no integration, too late leads","I got a copy of this from the public library. I am a non-certified group fitness instructor. The pace is too fast. Moreover, the moves are not introduced and integrated properly (it should slowly first and one by one, but they are rather fast and all at once) for the audience/followers. The fact that it needs to be 10 minutes is not a good excuse for this, either It can be done properly and integrated within 10 min. This could be very frustrating and even for me it is. I don't recommend it in this form. There are already much better examples than this, such as Janis Saffell's Quick Fix Total Cardio Kick (also 10min), which is much better."
4,Get Ready to SWEAT,"Overall, I really like the ""10 Minute Solution"" collection. So when I was ready to step it up from beginner to intermediate, I got so excited about this DVD. Well, these workouts are no joke! My face was beet-red, my heart was pumping and my muscles were burning. I believe this DVD is better for intermediate to advanced. Additionally, I was a lit' disappointed with the ""Low Impact Fat Blaster"" segment because I expected it to be more ""Jane Fonda-ish."" But overall, it's basically what it advertises. I look forward to continuing to improve my fitness level and be able to complete these segments with greater ease. What a wonderful goal!"
3,So-So Workout,"I'm so glad that I rented this workout for free from my local library instead of purchasing it! (which I suggest before buying any workout DVD). I agree with the other reviewers that a lot of it is very ""dancey"". I can pick up steps pretty easily, but ""Low Impact Fat Blaster"" and ""Cardio Max"" sections of this workout were too hard to follow for me. The ""Sports Drills"" and ""Kickboxing"" sections were decent. Did I work up a sweat? Yep, but during the fancy choreography sections, I just did my own thing to keep my heart rate up - which is why I would NOT buy this DVD. I love Tae Bo, Zumba, The Firm series, and the ""Shape 400-Calorie Fate Blast with Summer Sanders"" is the best!!!"
3,"Too dancy for me, but a good workout","If you like to dance and can remember routines easily, this is a great workout. It got my heart rate up and I sweated plenty. If you are like me and learn steps slowly and have trouble remembering dances, you may not love this one. A couple of times, by the time I figured out exactly what she was doing, she started doing something new. I prefer a routine where she tells you to do 20 squats, then she tells you to do 20 jumping jacks etc. ""Take it from the top"" is not a phrase I want to hear during a workout. I find exercise relaxing, except when I'm trying to follow a routine I simply can't remember, then its just frustrating. I found myself doing jumping jacks when I was lost in the routine- I could have done that without a video. Some people may love this, I just don't."
2,Hard to follow,I am not used to workout DVD's and found this one extremley difficult to follow. I felt that I spent more time trying to figure out how to do a move than actually exercising. She does not explain nor show what she is going to do next she just says it and does it. I feel that the DVD could at least show you the moves before she jumps right into it.
3,2 out of 5 ain't bad...,"Two of the workouts on this video are GREAT! (Power Sports Drills, Extreme Intervals)They are simple and easy to follow. They are challenging (which is what I was looking for, something to make me sweat). I love those two.The remaining three are difficult in a different way. They take a lot of coordination. The instructor uses dance moves that seem complicated to someone who doesn't dance.It was still worth the money, and maybe at some point I'll be able to follow the other three work outs! :)"
2,Does not Explain Steps,"I have bought many exercise videos over the years and this one though is a decent workout it is hard to follow. There are not good transitions, as she moves from exercise to exercise without really telling you what is going to come next. So I felt like I got left behind often, unlike many other DVDs where I was able to anticipate the next step easily."
5,""" Must Have"" Book for Every Nursing School!!!!","As a nurse missing a left hand I believe this is a ""Must Have"" in every nursing school in our country. Donna sets the tone and pace for students and instructors in the nursing profession. This book offers valuabe insight! With sample IEP the book serves as a fine example of a guiding light through the paper shuffle. I highly recommend this book!"
5,An Exceptional Read,"As an active Registered Nurse the rates of disability amongst nurses is on the rise. Many disabilities remain hidden being non-visual in nature. In this wonderful book Donna Maheady combines the stories of several nurses with various disabilities. I found these first person accounts to be revealing, in that each offered empathy, advice, guidance and information about their experiences as nurses with disabilities during nursing school, whether it be undergraduate or at the graduate level. Donna provides additional information of substance that should be utilized by nursing educators in the area of accomodation of these students.With specific advice on resources, advocacy etc. Nursing Students with Disabilities is an essential source of support for students and nursing educators."
5,Fantastic Book,"This book is a must read for everyone disabled or not. It is well organized, clearly written and easy to read. Ostensibly, it is the story of 8 nursing students with disabilities and how they got through school and their experiences both in school and at work. In my opinion, it is a great deal more. It is a book that presents 8 stories of people who refuse to give up until they have achieved what they have set out to achieve. It is a book with a well thought out and organized way to deal with challenges that could face any one of us. With a small amount of work each one of us could take that plan and mold it to our own lives and goals and it would help us enormously.The author has done a fabulous job of telling the stories, and showing each of ways to overcome obstacles.For those who have disabilities the books also presents a good set of resources for education and employment.This is a fantastic book!!!!"
2,An Album With Historical Value ...Only,"Affirmative: The Yes Solo Family Album compiles a little selection of the many solo projects of changing Yes members.The interesting aspect is how different paths of music genres the individual band members have been exploring. Ranging from pop-rock over jazz to Latin-American inspired music.It seems odd that Affirmative:... does not contain successes like The Buggles, Asia or King Crimson.The clearly most successful in his solo projects is keyboarder Rick Wakeman whose instrumental symphonies Merlin The Magician and Catherine Howard are the top tracks of this compilation.Unfortunately, seen from a musical quality point of view, it would be better to buy the solo albums one by one, taking individual taste into consideration. This album only has historical value for the enthusiastic Yes fan."
1,garbage,"about a week after the speakerphone starts malfunctioning, if u r selling garbage let the customer know that they are buying garbage...ok"
5,Get them both: No. 1-6!,"I got Perahia's English Suites as a birthday present, but that was not the complete version--literally a burnt CD of which tracks were selected from my friend's iTunes. And ever since I've fallen in love with it. It's so warming and as probably all Bach's works it comforts your heart endlessly. I will recommend it to anyone who fancies Perahia and Bach. Perfect combination, isn't it?"
3,title lives up to content,This is a good book that gives insight into how to linkfaith and culture. It shows the impact of decisions by using some clear examples of how things went wrong.
4,D C Confidences,"An interesting insight into to the world of diplomacy and politics. Christopher Meyer's biting yet diplomatic comments on the behaviour of our leading politicians and their accolites, including our own Prime Minister and the President of USA, proved an absorbing read which I found difficult to put down!"
4,"Provocative, informative and at times flat-out amusing...","This book is not only interesting, it is exceptionally well-written -- not always a hallmark of nonfiction, particularly economics texts. If you pick it up to browse, start with the chapter on the KKK -- it is truly amusing.While there isn't much of a coherent theme to this book, it is a good look at some provocative information (some of it squirm-inducing, to be sure) that seems to be based on pretty convincing numbers. My impression is that Levitt and Dubner are sincere in their desire to presents facts based on accurate statistics and not on an agenda. It makes for a sometimes unsettling but always fascinating read."
3,A pleasant read,"I liked this book because it's about Maine and it's well put together, like one of the Indian baskets the main character learns to create. It pulls you along and concludes satisfyingly. But maybe a little too satisfyingly: At around 19, Blue has her whole life figured out, which I find hard to buy. Also hard to believe is how noble the Indian characters are. Some flaws would have been nice. My other quibble (I know this is truly picky) is the constant use of ""alright"" instead of ""all right."" I look forward to reading other books by Thayer but hope she's edited a little better next time."
3,teenager sexual discovery,"Great for the young adult reader who is learning about who they are in relation to the stereotypes that surround them in today's world. Writing style is easy to read, a good rainy day book. Also very nice description of Maine, somewhat idealic, but nice nonetheless."
1,Parental Caution Advised,"My elementary school children came home upset that a classmate had been sharing material from this book at school. Apparently, a girl at school was reading this book outloud to them. Her mother apparently had read the brief description and reviews, and thought it would be an enjoyable book for her young daughter to read. Sometimes as parents,we do not have time to read the entire book first, but trust the general info we get from sites like this. Because of my children's concerns, I have now had the opportunity to review this book. This book is clearly not appropriate material for that age. There are graphic, detailed descriptions of premature ejaculation, as well as vivid descriptions of the actual sex act. With the other reviews, I wanted to post this so other mothers could be aware of this graphic content before purchasing for their elementary students. This isn't something that needs to be circulated around elementary school."
4,A great taste of Vietnam!!!,"This book is a great book if you want to explore the Vietnamese cuisine. The food is wonderful and so interesting. I was exposed to vietnamese cooking by my wife and got this book to surprise her. It was great and she was extremely happy. It really surprised her that I could do such a good job cooking the food that she grew up with. It was easy enough to cook, and very interesting to get exposed to what other cultures eat. I loved it."
5,"Great recipes, great story!","I bought this book for the authentic Vietnamese recipes, and ended up with both great dishes and a wonderfully descriptive and illustrated story of life in Southern California's Little Saigon. It would be a mistake to ignore the food, but this is still a very interesting book even if you never cook a meal."
5,Authentic; just like Grandma's cooking!!!,"Wow! What a great Vietnamese cookbook! I've tried several of the recipes and have been very impressed by the outcome, even with MY cooking! Now I won't have to bug my mom to make these authentic dishes for me! I liked it so much, I bought several to give as gifts!"
5,Love it!,"I like to try my hand at cooking foods I enjoy eating in restaurants and Vietnamese happens to be one of my favorites. I borrowed this book from the library and cooked several dishes, all which came out absolutely delicious. I liked it so much that after I returned the book to the library, I bought my own copy on amazon.It looks like I'll be able to recreate my favorite rice vermicelli, spring rolls, and pho dishes at home on a regular basis. For anyone who wants to try their hand at cooking Vietnamese dishes at home this one's a definite keeper."
4,Great Authentic Recipes,Book contains really good recipes and is presented well so following the recipes is not a problem.
2,Absence of Tamarind in Canh Chua recipe!,"I felt this book had a good collection of recipes of all the foods we love - YES! So then I turned to my husband's favorite dish and found that the canh chua recipe was missing tamarind. Isn't that one of the key ingredients?? Turned off by this very one detail, I am returning my purchase."
4,Easy to follow and not too bad,I've tried a few recipes in this book and it is not too bad. There isn't a book out there that you follow exact steps to get a perfect dish. You will still have to modify it a bit to fit your taste bud. This book was able to be that base starting point for me. Highly recommended.
5,Great book to curl up next to a fire with,"I initially purchased this book for the recipies, but soon found myself so entralled with the characters that I could hardly put it down. Ann le's description of tasting Pho' in little saigon is second only to Proust's madeline. Brilliant novel. guaranteed to be a classic"
3,Little Saigon Cookbook,"Ann Le's The Little Saigon Cookbook is a real gem as far as her huge collection of authentic Vietnamese recipes are concerned. I would give it a five star rating had she made a bigger production of the book by including larger, more vivid photos of each and every one of her finished dishes. I buy a cookbook by its eye appeal, if there aren't enough pictures of the food, I simply would not buy the book no matter how great the recipes are. I have never visited Southern California's Little Saigon before, but judging from the way Ms. Le wrote about the food being served in that locale, maybe I'm mistaken, but it sure as hell a lot better than what I get in Northern California."
4,Gushing but quite interesting and entertaining,"Ms. Meadows tells fascinating stories of her years working with Jackie Gleason, although sometimes she heaps the praise on a bit thick. Nevertheless, this autobiography is an absorbing read and a must for any ""Honeymooners"" fan."
4,Not bad,"This is the first foot soak I used and I liked it but I would go with the individual packages. I got both and I dont even break this one out anymore. Great for super dry cracked feet. My feet use to itch really bad and I thought it was athletes foot but after using foot spray for a couple of weeks it got worst and I noticed it was super ashy, so my friend told me to soak my feet and problems solved. Now I dont have trouble falling asleep because my feet are itching like crazy and not to mention they are easier on the eyes now not so much dry skin."
4,"Product is great, packaging was a bust","This was bought as a Christmas gift and the party who received it really likes it. My beef is the packaging it is shipped in describes the contents so it's hard to make a surprise gift out of it when everyone can read the contents. Other than that, it seems to work great."
4,"Good content, Poor Organization",This Forms Book has good content and poor organization. The book is also very in depth with covering the various parts of Forms Builder. I used this book to get started in the Oracle realm. I would suggest using the index and strolling over the topics important. This could help you get up to speed faster and not get booged down in the Extras...
1,"This isn't ""Greenfire"" as I know it","If you're looking for another album by the group Greenfire that did ""A Roof for the Rain"" this can't be it! Not a hammered dulcimer in sight.Full of vocals that leave much to be desired, both vocally and musically. Not folk, not Celtic, just miserable. I couldn't listen past the first song--skipped through the rest and they were all equally miserable."
2,not a PROHEAT,"I bought this hoping to save a little money over the PROHEAT heater. Big mistake. This heater has no PSA or ALUMINUM backing on it. I have two other PROHEAT heaters on other vehicles and they work great, down to -40F I do not recommend the Kats for engine heating , way too hard to put on. I do recmommend the PROHEAT pads. I have a model 512 CSA and a 154 CSA and now I am buying another 512 for my pickup"
4,Masters of the Universe Motion Picture,"Even though it does not follow the cartoon series exactly, it is still an excellent movie worth seeing. I enjoyed the many different aspects of this movie and would have enjoyed seeing a sequel to it if one had been made."
4,Great movie from my past,"Masters of the Universe is a great movie from my past. I was bored one day tooling around on the internet movie database at www.imdb.com and happened across Dolph Lundgren and saw that he protrayed He-Man. I decided then and there that I hadn't seen this movie in years and had to have it. Thanks Amazon, you have helped me in re-living a great movie from my childhood."
5,Pure Fun,"I dont remember watching He Man growing up, but I think I saw this movie. I watched this movie without thinking it would be anything speical, and I was wrong. The preview really drew me into the movie before I watched it. It was pure fun, and an excellent sci fi movie. Dolph Lundgreen was the main source for finding this movie, thanks Dolph! Where the heck are you these days? I didnt check all reviews but at the very, very end of the movie Skeltor comes on and says ""I'll be back"". Ha! Guess that movie never happened."
3,Great cheesy eighties fun,"Heman, one of my favorite childhood cartoon heros brings the battle to earth on the bigscreen. Fun movie, not a great work of art, but good cheesy eighties fun. Plus, Courtney cox when she was actually pretty hot.Don't expect an epic, this is Conan the Barbarian for kids."
2,This was unlike the cartoon and very disappointing.,"I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw this movie. First of all, He-Man was not himself, and the very corny plot just had nothing to do with the cartoon at all! What kind of film did they put together for this mess?! I prefer the cartoon any day, because the very disappointing movie is disrespectful to the real character of He-Man!"
2,Masters of the Universe,"I was really excited when I bought this movie until I watched the DVD.Throughout the entire movie there is commentary from the director, you don't hear the characters voices, you only hear the directors voice, in order to know what is going on, turn down the volume, that is the only way to shut up the commentary and use the subtitles.It would be a great movie without the commentary."
1,We wish we could rate it 0 stars,"What to say? We're not sure how to describe the absolute atrocity that was this film. Film? We meant tragedy. We're not even sure what made it so bad - but we want our two hours back. We did think Skeletor had a nice float in the Masters of the Universe parade, though. We guess that's worth a star."
1,Awful.,"I thought this movie was such a disappointment when it came out.Until the X-Men came out 10 or so years ago, most comic book/cartoon related movies were garbage, with the exception of the Superman I-II movies.This is a good example why they should've leave such movies back in time.I suppose if you were 8 yrs old when you saw this back then you might still love it- it seems movies that may have been popular with little kids seem to still do well years later- Star Wars, Wizard Of Oz, Labyrinth , Never Ending Story, etc regardless of how good or bad the stories are."
3,CHILDHOOD MEMORIES,"I remember watching this movie as a kid and thinking how great this was - I used to always get these flash backs about the time shifter thingy. So when it came up on Amazon I just had to buy it. I admit, it wasn't as good as when I was a kid, but it was still worth watching and adding to the collection!!!"
3,"Not like the cartoon,but okay.","I have to say that in a way this movie is half good and half bad.The actors did a great job but the story wasn,t mostly based on the popular cartoon.Movies like Ghostbusters are super spectaular.If I were to grad this movie I,d give it a C+.But it can be entertaining in a different sort of way.The ccastle greyskull looked very different and there were a lot of characters missing.So I have to give it a thumb up and thumb down."
2,Pretty Bad,"I might love the music of the 80's, but the decade did churn out some pretty cheesy works in the realm of cinema. This film highlights that fact pretty well.I loved the Masters of the Universe action figures, but this movie just doesn't link with those great toys at all. It spends too much time on a pair of teenagers on Earth who no one is interested in. If the script would have replaced both of them with Moss Man, then maybe the movie could have been somewhat redeemed.Why did there have to be a fight in a music store anyway? That's not what Masters of the Universe is supposed to be all about. Fight in a place that's awesome, darnit! This ain't Roadhouse.The performance of the guy who played Skeletor is the only thing that saves this movie from getting one star."
2,Ugh...,"Calling this film bad is like saying the Empire State Building is tall. Bad acting, poor writing, horribly staged action scenes. The only saving grace from keeping this off of ""Battlefield Earth"" status is some ""good"" acting from Langella which is only considered good when compared with the rest of the cast. It also features a nice score from Bill Conti, but oh what a waste. They could have made a film that brought together sci-fi and sword and sorcery and instead they came up with yet another bad knock-off of ""Star Wars""."
5,I Have the Power,"Although this movie is a little campy, it is still a great representation of one of the greatest cartoons of the 80s. Dolf plays a great HeMan, and the inclusion of Courtney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeil (later to be Star Trek Voyager's Tom Paris) as well as Frank Langella as Skeletor are great casting moves. Leonard Maltin NEVER gives a good review to a movie, unless it's artsy, and probably never had an ounce of fun at a movie in his life. Don't bother to ever listen to his reviews! Get this movie!"
2,"This would have been a great movie, but...","This is one movie that had all the right ingrediants to be a fantastic movie. Hollywood could not have picked better characters to play these parts. Dolph Lundgren as He-Man, and Frank Langella as Skeletor were the perfect choices. If the whole movie had stayed on Eternia, this movie might have been a keeper. Unfortunately, the whole cast decided to come to Earth, and that was the biggest mistake of the movie! Earthlings just don't mix with other guys from other worlds, and it certainly shows in the mix. I think this should be a lesson to Hollywood- if you are going to make a movie about cartoon characters, watch what makes the cartoon work in the first place, then make the movie!"
2,This is not the super hero you grew up with.,"I was a big He-Man fan. The Cartoon show that is. This remake for the big screen did a lot of things to change the story. Not a single one of which I agree with. For one thing in this movie you will see a lot of ray guns. Something you never would see in the cartoon. He-Man is not Star Wars. Although they tried to make Masters of the Universe the movie more like Star Wars then the actual cartoon. Seeing He-Man with his ray gun was rather dissapointing. I found this film to be ok. OK acting. OK story. OK effects. Although I do like how they did the Skeletor mask. Meg Foster is very attractive as Evil-Lyn and Dolph Lundgren looks just like a real life He-Man would look. This film stars a young Courtney Cox from TV's ""Friends"" as the young girl the Masters must save. Another letdown was the omition of that awesome wizard from the cartoon that didn't have a face. I think his name was Orko."
3,lil disappointment,"hmmm the picture wasnt as great as i expected, didnt look like it was blue ray, wish it was much beter."
2,New School Never Touches Old School,"I Have watched numerous He-man cartoons, maybe all of them. I have seen the animated movie. This is nothing like the cartton movie(which i highly recommend)or the cartoon series. He-man never transends time and goes back to Earth. Who the heck is that little dwarf guy. Since when does Teala wear costumes like that. As a scifi flick for someone who never watched the He-man cartoon, its pritty good. But it doesn't come close to the cartoon it was ""based off""."
1,A Great cartoon turned into a horrible film,"He-man And The Masters Of The Universe, the cartoon that spawned this film, was so much better than this movie. For all of the people who are thinking about buying this movie because it was good when you were young I have a piece of advice: Don't buy this because you remember it being good 14 years ago. Father time has sweetened your memory of this wretched film, I assure you. If you want a good He-man movie, I suggest you save the 15.00 dollars you were going to spend on this DVD and spend it on a used copy of Secret Of The Sword, the animated He-man and She-ra film from 1985."
1,A blast from the past,"We really got the movie, because the kids were talking about it. My son had all of the figures and castles when he was young. I had recently found some of the figures in an antique store, and we just wanted to see the movie again. It was cheesy, but we all got a kick out of watching it."
1,I Like the Cartoon -- Hated the Movie,"In all honesty -- I LOVED THE CARTOON SERIES -- one of my favorites as a kid. I remember I bought this on VHS about a year ago, I was 19 years old at the time and I was like whoa! live action he-man -- I was stoked. Imagine my disappointment when I found out this movie sucked, and I'm not talking just a little bit, it was probably the biggest piece of crap I'd ever watched and I wish I had the time out of my life back and my $12 back.BUY IT IF YOU DARE! BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT!!"
1,No Power Here!,"First of all, let me say that I LOVE the Masters of the Universe/He-Man cartoons. So I rented this movie one time thinking it would be at least half as campy, and goofy as the cartoons. Wrong!This is one of the few videos I have ever rented that I actually fast-forwarded through because it was so boreing!Dolph looks nothing like the cartoon He-Man, and the Skeletor was absolutley HORRIBLE!!!! I don't know how this movie could be any worse. The acting is terrible, and so is the action.This looks like an after-school special He-Man style. Don't waste your money on this one..."
3,Masters of the universe,This movie is fun a good laugh a bit of action and takes your mind off the sad things around you for a little while.
4,Masters of the Universe Live Action Movie,"Considering the time it was made, it's really not a bad movie. I enjoyed it very much and even bought the VHS tape a few years back. I plan to get the DVD in October. While it wasn't completely on track with the cartoon, it has it's own worth-while value that makes it unique and definitely worth owning."
1,Bad Quality,Looked like VHS quality....so upset. Looked no different than the DVD copy I already had. Do not waste the time and effort on this blu ray
3,Classic... Sort Of,"Watching this as an adult is harder than I thought it would be, but my 6 year old was into and made me feel less guilty for loving it when I was a child. Not the best movie, but I have good memories of watching this when I was young. Even back then I was upset that it wasn't more like the cartoon, but it grew on me and has stuck to me since. It's cool owning this on Blu-ray, but I cant say that it looks too much better then it does on DVD. It sucks that there is not any special features. I think the only benefit of putting an old movie like this on Blu-ray is using that extra disc space for features and this release really failed in doing that."
2,What was this about?,"Am a big fan of Dolph Lundgren films... have quite a collection on DVD's, but this one put me to sleep. There may be some tie in with possibly a comic book series or something, don't really pay much attention to movies based on comic books, some series, or particular charactors, so can't comment on that aspect of it, but this particular title totally lost me from the beginning, and it wasn't long before I was snoring away. Maybe I need to give this one more chance, maybe a bit earlier in the evening, and hope that it will hold my attention better."
3,Maybe too campy even for fans,"Only a He-man fan would want to watch this one. The cast and crew got almost everything wrong, and the exception is Frank Langella's rendition of Skeletor. Never has Skeletor been as menacing as in this movie. Dolph Lundgren may have done a better job had he gotten the role in his later years. There was so much potential with the concept of bringing the battle to Earth, but the movie just didn't have oomph. They didn't show enough of the struggle on Eternia and why it meant so much to He-man and company."
3,Masters of the Universe,"Masters of the Universe. The universe of masters, this movie about masters of the universe mastered my universe until the universe of my masters mastered this universe. Of the masters, universe mastered of the Dolph Lundgren tangent. Enough said, Lundgren. Dolphsters of the Lundgrenverse. I think I made my point. Pony."
4,"Evil-Lyn, Overlooked Villain",Meg Foster is the archtypical Evil-Lyn. I love that she is the only one of Skeletor's company who is not afraid of him. She is icy cool.Dolph Lundgren IS He-Man.
5,"I like it, it was a good action flick, overall.","The movie was ok, though I was disapointed that BattleCat was there. He-Man never went anywhere without. And Greyskull was always gloomy in appearence. It made first time viewers think twice about the sorceress living there."
3,ALL AND ALL ALRIGHT!,"This movie doesn't lack any action like the cartoon, but should stick with the same characters in the cartoon. These people who made the movie, should learn everything from the cartoon before making it into a movie. I think these people would have learned a thing or two from the cartoon! I think there should be a remake of the movie because there were a lot of improvements they could make! All and all an alright movie!"
3,Good but not Great.,"This film tried to hard to be Star Wars. It was a good idea, what would happen to Eternia after Skeletor finally won. This way you could get rid of the king and queen, say they were killed, and still keep severasl key players. I thinkl the idea to take the heroes to earth was a dumb idea. They could of had so much to do in the Eternian landscape. The really good thing about htis film is Frank Langellas performance as Skeletor. And Dolph Lungren isn't as bad as he could be. But the filmakers choice to make other supporting players old and new was good and bad. The use of Man-at-arms, Teela and Beast man was good. But making up new characters like blade, wasn't. They could have had more fum had they stuck to people from hte television show, like Trapdraw, Cyclops, Ram-man and They chose Grildor over Orko. But though it had many faults, it still wasn't a horrible attempt. I think If I were to remake it, it would be less Star Wars and more fantasy adventure fun."
5,Loved the movie,Disc came in excellent condition and it play smoothly and was a great watch I enjoyed every minute of the movie a must see if you like He-man...
5,Great addition to the Tri-Ply Line,"The nonstick frying pans are the final piece to the Tri-Ply line. We have a complete set of the line's stainless pans, but nothing is easier for making some quick breakfast eggs than these nonsticks. It's a shame that Calphalon has discontinued the non-stick pans in the line."
2,"Loved and adored the omlet pan, BUT, the surface peeled off.","This was the favorite of all my Calphalon non stick pans. It could go in the dishwasher safely, looked beautiful, cooked like a dream and was a perfect price. Everything was wonderful, but all of a sudden the non-stick coating gave up sticking to the surface and came peeling off, as if the adhesive had given up. It wasn't abused and I used the right utensils and never cooked with it on high heat. Now I have to return it to the manufacturer and the pan has been discontinued. What a pain!"
2,Should have been called Craps on Yello,"None of these remixes (with the possible exception of Moby's) even come close to the quality of the original tracks. A few are tolerable, but most are mindless techno-style thump-thump-thump-thump ""dance"" mixes that obliterate the charm of the songs in order to make them palatable to the musically-crippled. The only reason to buy this disc is if you want to collect absolutely everything Yello has released. Even then, you'd do best to stick it in the back of your closet and never play it."
3,Warning!,"This title, among quite a few now listed at Amazon, is available directly from the Warner Archive for only $19.95. Why pay more?"
4,toshiba onceover,Overall performance is good to very good. However I found the buttons on the remote hard to use.
3,Not happy with the new formula,"We have used this solution for brushing the dogs' teeth for a few years, alternating with toothpaste just to be sure we're covering all the bases. My last shipment is different: instead of being a yellowish watery solution that the dogs tolerated (let's face it - it can't compare to chicken-flavored toothpaste), it is now a clear viscous solution that drips, is sticky and dries hard if it gets in their hair. And the dogs don't seem to like it very much. I have to use up the three bottles I ordered, but I don't think I'll get it again."
1,repugnant to cats,"The mouthwash was a very unpleasant item to use for cats. It is advertised for cats, but its stickiness is so repugnant for cats that they yak and run away.If any of it gets into their fur, its impossible to get out because of the stickiness. It ends up a disgusting unpleasant mess. The cat looks like seagull from the gulf with all its feathers sticking up. He can't wash it out, bec its like Elmer's glue has hardened in his fur. I would suggest that it needs another way of applying the mouthwash than spraying it in the mouth with just an opening in the top of the bottle and squeezing it. Barely any gets in the cat's mouth and that he hates so much he spits out.I did contact the seller but they did not entertain my complaint and told me to see my vet about my cat's reaction. (He had recently been to the vet and has no problems, but does need his teeth kept clean)-olo"
1,Not really for MAC,"I really can't give a review because I ordered this product to use on a MAC and the box is marked as a Window 95, 98, NT, 2000 product. Make sure you have one of these operating systems before ordering"
5,Must Have it!,"I have had the opportunity to use this piece of hardware now for well over a month and can quite positively say it has been a great addition to my computer. I do a great deal with my computer working in multimedia. I have a printer, scanner, graphics pad, dual monitors, VCR, tape deck, and occasoinally my digital still camera, as well as digital Handycam all connected to my computer. The Sabrent PCI card has fullfilled all my needs for extra access to USB/firewire ports. Even though there was no documentation it went together intuitively easy. Took me about fifteen minutes to install. The front ports for USB and firewire are the berries! Everyone with a digital camera should have this frontside access. Buy it, install it, forget-about-it."
4,Many Ports,"I found this to be an excellent addition in my tower setup. However having a large scale atx chassis I was limited by the length of the cable. Not so much a problem as I had several internal devices I wished to condense into larger, better hardware."
5,Great Product,This raised panel router bit set has more bits than others and the price is certainly right.
5,Childhood Favorite,When I was younger my sister Samantha and I loved this movie! I just ordered it on DVD for my little brother because the tape we had was played so much it wont play anymore. I recomend it for your children.
5,sunday in new york,"I enjoyed this movie when I was younger and was hoping to find it on dvd but no luck, so I am happy to at least have it on vhs. The quality of the tape was still in good condition."
5,Sunday in New York,"I do miss Sunday in New York, I even like the apartment (or set?) of this movie and that music from Peter Nero, I have the soundtrack, but no way to pay $40 for a VHS."
5,A Real Gem,"This film is a gem!! It should be released on DVD with quality augmented, formatting for various screens, and closed captions in various languages for hearing impaired. It's a must-have!!!!"
5,RELEASE THIS MASTERPIECE ON DVD......PLEASE!!!!!,Thousands of bad movies have been released on DVD. What about this masterpiece? Afraid of not enough buyers because it's from the sixties? You'll be surprised. I copied this wonderful movie from video to DVD but I want the real thing in widescreen and more quality.
3,not exactly what I was looking for!,this dvd was ok but not exactly what I wanted in an instructional DVD. the dvd was in good shape though so no complaints with the service.Jerry
4,"Some good, timeless ideas","I have recently become a big fan of the ""Idea Book"" series from Taunton. This one is no exception with plenty of ideas that cover every gamut of the back yard. Although this book is pushing 5 years old, luckily this subject matter is less susceptible to trends and fads, so the images and ideas are timeless.I recommend this to anyone that is looking for some ideas, whether it's sprucing up a zone, or small area, to the entire backyard. Only complaint is that there are a few over the top, million dollar mansion photos that just don't seem to fit with the subject. When you start measuring your backyard in acres...well then that's just a different story."
4,Good buy:),I think this book is very insirational and has very good information:) the only reason why I gave it four instead of five stars was because I thought they could have used more up to date photos.
2,just looking,"This book has excellent photo's of backyard ideas. It is a great book if you are just looking for ideas. I had expected a book with a little ""how-to"" mixed in."
2,Zhukov Propoganda,"Zhukov as the greatest general of WWII? So much propoganda that students of history will see through. The producers attempt validity by interviewing history professors and the US Army War College and the British Staff College (Sandhurst), but it does not change the facts. The video shows only the ""good"" and none of the bad, like so many Soviet eara propoganda films. Same old footage that you see in so many other videos about the fall of Berlin interspersed with lots of panorammas of the battle areas today. Save your money."
1,poor quailty book,"This book is a waste of time and money. I can't believe someone would write such a sub-standard book and put it on the market for purchase. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. I only bought it because one of my instructors made it mandatory, however I would have bought something else. It is a waste of good resources. The book is very vague on its subject material and very outdated."
5,Death Metal Domination,"Decapitated dominates and this album is probably the best death metal album of the year so far. Blistering fast drums and intense and technical guitar work and one truly amazing death metal vocalist makes for a killer album. This album is blistering fast moving along sometimes at paces that are unthinkable. Through it all, it is this band's musicianship that puts them above a lot of the competition. Everyone in this band is in their early 20's but even at their young age they are probably one of the best newer death metal bands out there. Other great bands from Poland are Vader and Behemoth."
5,Maybe Number1 of the Year,"Might be the best album of this year. I have not heard such a good album SINCE( not as good) Tomb Of The Mutilated and Pierced From Within.The new heros of Death Metal. In a day when everything plays the same melodic death as In Flames and Dark Tranquility, they play fast, brutal and breath new life into extreme music."
2,hmm...,"This is yet another overhyped death metal band that seems to grace the shelves of my local Sam Goody in the mall.Finally succumbing to the ""praise"" the band and this album received, i picked it up after getting my replay $5 certificate in the mail.so...$16.99 + tax (mall prices) - $5.00 (certificate) = $11.99 + tax....i paid too much for this."
1,Utter Pap- Doesn't deserve ANY stars,"Icky! The last sentence of every paragraph is meant to be overtly thought provoking. How much better the book would be if Diane spent more time making the whole chapter good rather than just the last sentence. I was able to flip through the book at random and read the last sentences to my husband to illustrate how desperately deep this woman tries to be and he said that with just the few sentences I pulled, there is no way he could sit through a whole book filled with such pap. I was introduced to this book after telling someone about ""Botany of Desire"" and they felt that ""A Natural History of the Senses"" would be something I would enjoy. It is not a history of history or the senses, or nature. It took three tries for me to get past the first PAGE and agony to get through the entire book. Utter Torture. Utter Pap. I love books of all sorts, but this was a waste of time, ink, printing presses and effort."
3,expected more,"I can't say this is a bad book, but I don't feel I got my money's worth. It is light on the science. It should be called a celebration of the senses. It gives a bunch of andectodal facts and musings of the author wich I didn't find interesting. I have recently read much better books in the science section of my local book store."
5,Feast for the eyes!,Totally sense-sual! This book is the literary equivalent of an erotic all-you-can-eat buffet! Ackerman demonstrates the beauty and eroticism of the everyday bathed in pools of pure primal desire! She is the epitome of the scholarly hedonist sharing her eclectic interests and leaving her audience panting for more.
4,Fascinating book,I really enjoyed this book. It is full of interesting information about the five senses. I gave it only 4 out of 5 stars though because I thought the chapters on hearing and vision got a little off the topic at times.
2,A Natural History of the Bored Stiff Reader,"Although Ackerman's zest for the senses was more than obvious throughout the text, the book suffered from an insufferable amount of anecdotes (some of which had no connection at all whatsoever to the titles). Shame, that the reader had to wait to get all the way to the last chapter on Synesthesia to begin enjoying what started out as quite an exciting read. While I did enjoy the odd fact, I can't help but wonder who let her carry on adding the same tiresome biographical snippets which bogged the whole book down to the bottom of my trash bin."
4,A box of chocolates rather than a steak dinner,"Readers expecting a meaty discussion of the science and history of the senses won't find it here. The book reminded me of a box of good chocolates: it's fun, full of variety and surprises, and a pleasant diversion, if not very substantial. I found it perfect for traveling: the chapters are brief and fairly self-contained, and you can read the book in bits and pieces and still find it enjoyable. In the category of ""brain candy,"" this is definitely Belgian chocolate."
4,A Natural History of the Senses arouses!,"As a gift from a loving son I wandered into this impressively researched & fluently written expose of our senses. How we delight our senses varies greatly from culture to culture, yet the ways in which we use our senses is the same all around the globe! Our senses connect us intimately to our past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could. From those fabled footsteps in lava to our sense of touch & so on this author has woven a mighty fine tapestry of what give us the spice of life! Fascinating!()"
5,Just Beautiful,"This is my favorite nonfiction book, bar none. It is written like a novel and yet, manages to be chock full of textbook-worthy information. The chapter on smell is simply incredible. I have loaned out countless copies of this book, never received one of them back, and just keep buying more. Please just buy yourself a copy so I can hang on to mine."
4,Too Good,"I absolutely love this book, well-researched work. The author kept it interesting as well, nice to know bit of science behind our senses."
2,It's just OK,It's just OK! Fuzzy pictures! Your money is better spent on others! BBC or Time-Life! Fine for a Big Library!
4,a nice follow up,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film""The Beales of Grey Gardens"" is a sequel to ""Grey Gardens"" composed of footage not included in the previous releease.Since the release of the first film, ""Grey Gardens"" became very popular and spawned a Broadway musical. This inspired a release of extra footage.The only special feature is an introduction by one of the Maysles brothers.This film is available by itself or in a box set with the previous release."
3,"American Gothic at its best! Or, worst!","The infamous Beales; what more can be said? It was interesting, but far too sad when you think of what she could have done with her life. What a monster of a mother!"
1,Buyer beware,"Being completely caught up with the intriguing tale of the Beales, I followed Amazon's advice which suggested I buy not one, but both DVDs, ""Grey Gardens"" and ""The Beales of Grey Gardens"". Every indication led me to believe that these were two separate films.Imagine my disappointment to open the double set, only to find that one of them is a duplicate of the single DVD. Shame on Amazon for this misleading sales tactic."
1,A disappointment,"Tedious and repetitive, without the fascination factor of the early documentary by the Maysles. Thought I was ordering that one - next time I'll check more carefully."
3,Not as good as the original.,"Unlike other reviewers here, I found this new film much more depressing than the original. Here we hear Little Eadie denying her schizophrenia, however, the bulk of the film shows her to be severely delusional. Unlike the original, this new ""Grey Gardens"" lacks the sweetness and hopefulness of the relationship between mother and daughter, and substitutes a dreary voyeurism."
5,A Must!,For those who are Beales fans you have to ADD to your DVD collection. To see the original guys film these laides is a classic. Its nice to have to go back over and over again to hear what the laides said is nice to have it for that.
3,good,Hard to follow but interesting character study of these 2 women who clearly marched to a beat all their own!
5,Fantastic,"I liked this new version even better. More fab costumes from Little Edie and lots more insight into the ladies. I saw the Musical last year and loved it, but it didn't strike me until I saw this documentary and now the ladies live. I am so amazed at the perfect reproductions that Christine Ebersol and Mary Louise Wilson made of Big and Little Edie.I am so touched by these women. I wished that I had known them and they also scare a piece of them that live inside me."
2,Poor wipe quality,"I like the ingredients in this product, however, the quality of the wipe fiber is very poor. They constantly rip and are very hard to use when you need them to separate quickly. In addition, the moisture content is not equally distributed throughout the whole package probably due to the poor quality of fiber material. Near the top of the package the wipes don't seem very moist, but at the end they are soaking wet and rip into pieces easier. The texture of the wipe is also quite rough compared to other wipes I've used. I find myself using more wipes to get the job done than other wipes I've used. If the company could improve the wipe material, it would be a decent wipe."
4,Great wipes but need improvement !,"I picked them b/c I was looking for a product with no chemicals, natural as possible. Very good wipes. No scent and no chemicals. Great Non-Toxic Disposable Wipe Alternative but they need improvement. Wish the wipes were separated like other wipes. They are not folded like other wipes, they are perforated but difficult to tear off one handed. The container doesn't really help to separate the wipes. You pretty much have to use both hands; one to hold the wipe and the other the bag or container to tear apart the sheets. The cloths are a little thin and break easily especially when you have a few wipes left in the container, the bottom wipes are more moist and wet than at the top which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.I will use Seventh Generation wipes, they are easier to tear off."
1,Gave Baby a Diaper Rash,These rough Tushies wipes actually gave my baby a diaper rash which we had to treat with petroleum jelly and dampened Charmin toilet paper.
4,Great Wipes. A little too wet.,"These wipes are a nice thickness and have a pleasant smell. My only complaint is that they are very moist. When you get to the bottom of the package the wipes are actually dripping wet. They also need to be torn apart, they are perforated. Not a big deal for me, but may bother others. Still these are the best natural wipes that I have tried. Seventh Generation have a sour smell, Earth's Best, too thick and too wet, Nature babycare, too dry, too thin and too many come out at a time."
5,Does the job without chemicals!!,"These wipes are great!! No worry about harmful chemicals and perfumes on your baby's delicate skin. These are a great kept secret from the mainstream hype of advertised products that contain ingredients you can't even pronounce. Our baby/toddler has not had any diaper rashes nor dry skin whatsoever!! If you have any doubt, buy one container before you buy the case. The price is competitive and with free shipping straight to your door. It doesn't get any better than this!"
4,Happy,I like these wipes. The only downfall is that they are all separted and it's hard to get them apart when you have one hand on the kid and the other hand trying to get a wipe. I like that they are nice and moist. My hubby wishes they were thicker. Overall I think these are a good wipes.
2,Why don't they tear apart from each other easier?!?,"These wipes really pissed me off a lot.. They are the most natural and so I went for them.. And I like the strength, consistency, absorbancy, smell, ingredients.. They were great EXCEPT: they are not individual wipes. They are perforated and connected.. and they are really hard to separate! We all know changing diapers involves one hand holding feet and arms out of the way, so the other hand gets the wipes.. Well, with these wipes I had to use a foot too to hold the wipes package while the free hand tore them apart.. Not good. These would be perfect if only for that.."
2,a small book of poetry in four sections,"This is a collection of poems published in 1917.The first section of poems are domestic (as the title suggests), such as; ""Bayberry Candles"" and ""The Cedar Chest"". The 2nd section is called ""A Handful of Sonnets"". Some of these poems are ""O. Henry - Apothecary"" and ""For the Centenary of Keat's Sonnet"". The 3rd section is entitled ""War"". Poems like ""On Vimy Ridge"" and ""To a U-Boat"". The 4th section's poems seem to be random. Anything from ""At a Dog Show"", to ""Ballad of New Amsterdam"" to ""Moons We Saw at Seventeen"". There are 72 poems in all.Some of the poems are short and simple. Others are more complex. The sad part is that the longer poems are not complete. Whoever scanned the pages of the original book left off the endings of the longer poems :(- posted by Poore Richard's wyfe"
5,A great book for people who have anxiety about learning softward,"Kevin Seigel has put together the simplest, handiest, user- friendliest book I can imagine on Pagemaker and I recommend it to everybody who has the software as a basic reference. I have always considered myself to be too impatient to learn Pagemaker. I've taken Pagemaker classes and felt like I failed & they failed because they're so boring and it all seems so easy, but when I leave class I forget it all and none of the manuals or handouts are very good and when I try to put a page together I just get upset. But this book is so step by step and basic, if you just do it, take it lesson by lesson, you'll find yourself understanding how the program works and what it can do, at least enough to accomplish whatever project you're working on. I'm happy to say that the knowledge builds on itself and I actually feel that I'm gaining some proficiency in Pagemaker!Do yourself a big favor and buy this book."
2,black and white book not advanced,"I read the good review from here and brought this book, only found this is more like a training material without any good quality picture to show how to do things. I wish I brought a more interesting book. Other than cover, the whole book is black and white, just like printed from a mono laserjet."
2,incmplete book,"the editors boast themselves as modern .in the 6 edition authors did not even mention h. pylori in the pathology of peptic ulcer whereas harrison' 13 edn discussed about it. also the urology chapter is badly written with not even a mention on CA urethra ,peyronie's disease.also the treatments are incomplete.also the concept of GE reflux &its relation to standing & lying is totally wrong(infact opposite).go for a greenfield or asabiston instead."
1,electronic playing card shuffler,"I bought this item a few weeks ago for a gentleman who has problems with his hands. He loved it...however, it broke within a month and since I gave it as a gift, I did not hold onto the reciept or original box....If you order this, make sure you hold on to those things in case yours breaks too.239robyn"
5,Echos of the Soul,I really enjoyed and felt enlighted by this book. I have made life changes because of it. It inspired me to be a better person and also to have more patience with people. I try to live more by my intuition and I am more accepting of things when they don't go as I plan. I have bought this book for about 5 people I know in hopes that it inspires them the way it inspired me.
4,Stephan berg review. Probably wont even read this since u wrote 11yrs ago.Echo is not the only one.Try Betty Eadie or D.Brinkley,Try danion brinkley or betty eadie along with this Echo. mr. BERG best do some more research.word word word word
4,Echoes of the Soul Review,"I personally have not read it. I bought this for a friend and have not heard anything bad,so I can only assume that they like it."
5,This Book Helped me Find Peace,"After reading this book I found peace with my life and my faith. I have been going through alot the past few years and was finding it hard to cope with... now I feel nothing but peace with my struggle. If you are open to the ideas of reincarnation, life after death, angels and a nonjudgemental God... then this book can help you to deal with loss, life and death. A great read!"
5,A very clear explaination of the work of the soul,Echo gives us a jounery though life and death and the continuity of the soul in both. Written well and clearly for all to understand. A watershed book for the searcher.
3,Tourist guide to heaven?,"I found the book a good read and enlightening ,,, but it certainly stretches my imagination when someone claims to have made a journey to Heaven ... even on a psychic level. Echo Bodine is the only one that I know of who has made this divine voyage (and given a fairly extensive tour at that.) Doubtful here in Florida."
5,Great Reading,"I read this book with great interest. Two years ago, before I knew anything about ""The Other Side"", I visited over there. Nothing written can match that experience, but this comes close. This book is well-written and describes the scenes I saw so well."
4,Military Strategy for Novices,"This book is a ""Cliff notes"" of military strategy gurus. Good snyopsis of classic works on military strategy including Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. Definitely a must read for personnel attending any of the Senior Service Schools who do not have the experience in the strategy area. Easy to read and understand."
5,An Amazing Story,"I totally and completely love this book. No other book has ever made me cry, but this one did. You can really feel the emotion of the writer, and his pain that he was feeling at the time. I would tell anyone to read this book, because it is wonderful!!!"
4,Fantastic expression of pain and sorrow.,"I only give this book a 4 because I do not believe in perfection (5 stars). There is always room to improve, otherwise life would be cheapened. This book comes close as you can get to perfection. I think the blend of love and poetry help to even out the violent theme's contained within the pages. O'Barr's self counseling creation has helped to shed a different light on pain and sorrow. Also, death is shown not to be the end all, but the begining..."
1,Bland,"I just read this book after remembering not liking parts of the original movie I saw, hoping the actual work the movie had been based on was better. It wasn't, it was worse. The author kept referencing various other points of literature and music, including direct Joy Division quotations in the titles and dialogue (nothing wrong Joy Division of course, but utilizing pre-existing titles and threads, as well as a good bit of the layout and artwork, from somebody else's aesthetic concept is just plain lazy); as well as other various poets, writers, and even an entire Cure song. Very cardboard cutout stock, characters, zero development, and no, the lead character was not very developed either. An adolescent boring read, though mercifully quick."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"An influential book, but not one that thrilled me enough to want to read it more than once or twice. A dead man is brought back to life by a mystical force, represented by the black bird.The backdrop to the murders he is to avenge is the destruction that happens in Detroit around Devil's Night."
5,This is the best book I've read of any kind.,"This book has the best story and that no other author could express the pain that the character is going through like O'Barr. I first saw the movie and I read the book later and the book is a lot better, even though the movie was very good with Brandon's performance. I would recommend this books to anybody who likes dark fantasty or a dark, gothic, romantic book."
5,I can't believe it's out of print now.,"Nothing I can write here will really convey how incredibly, intensely moving this book is. Like other reviewers, I read this book because of my love for the movie--but the movie is NOTHING compared to the book. I've had my copy of this book for seven years now. It's battered and creased because I carried it around in my backpack for so long, reading it again and again. I came to Amazon to get a new copy because my old one is so worn-out. I don't know of anyone who has read The Crow without it seriously affecting them. It's out of print now for some reason I cannot understand, but if you can find a used copy, then by all means do so. You won't be sorry. I really just cannot say enough about it. Buy it used, borrow it from a friend, do whatever it takes to read it."
2,"Some compellingly raw poetry, occasionally competent art.","This book is an interesting first effort (as far as I know it is O'Barr's first) that has it's moments, but overall I was unimpressed by this work. I think the main reason this work hits as hard as it does is not due to the skill of O'Barr (especially the art) but the raw emotion that assails you throughout. However, I don't feel this is due to the skill of the author (no disrepect to O'Barr) but the sheer power of his experience. After reading it the first time and dealing with the reality of the authors experience that inspired this work, I have to say the book really is not that well done. There is some nice poetry (although I'm sure Garth Ennis would not agree) but I feel the art is definitely sub-standard-although it has its moments. I can think of many other titles worthy of 5 stars."
5,Mark Twain,"Love this book, it is one I have been meaning to by for some time now and decided I better get it dons"
4,"Mark Twain, always a favorite but..","I am a fan of Mark Twains works. My favorite being Huckelberry Fin. If you are reading this you too are a fan, you are not wondering if this a good story but if this is a good edition to buy. I do like the collection of books that are contained within this edition, however I am not impressed with the packaging. The acid free pages are very thin and almost transparent. I do not like the paper that it was printed on. The ""hardcover"" is made of very weak material, I do not foresee this edition standing the test of time and I just got it in the mail recently. The collection is great, the binding not so much."
4,Great way to add drives to a server...if you have lots of power cords,"Once this is installed, which isn't that hard but it slightly painful because of all the individual connectors for each bay. I understand why each bay need a sata connector. I'm not sure why it needs a power connector.Anyway. It works well. Isn't quite as 'solid' as I would have liked. But it does seem to function quite well.All in all I recommend this product. It takes a little longer to install if you like to neaten up your internal cables because there are so many. But the ability to just slide a drive in instead of mounting it to a carrier is quite a nice feature."
3,typical day in the life of a spy,"Pretty much what you would expect...lots of tension, saving the world, wisecracks, spectacular special effects and CGI...so glad I didn't pay ten bucks for admission into the movie theater!"
2,Short extra,"This is a very short extra with commentary about the stunts on the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. This ""special feature"" is too short, and I'm glad it was free for me, but seeing Tom Cruise perform his own stunts did heighten my respect for him just a bit."
1,The worst ever!!!,I have no ideal what is going on. when i first bought i tough it is a full movie but it actually crap and stupid stuff that i don't want to know. and it just wasting my time!!!!!!!!
3,My rental,"I thought it was the weakest of the four so far. Still good enough for the average movie, but I expect more of this group."
3,Track Listings Not in Proper Order,"The music samples do NOT correspond to the numbering of the tracks. Also there are many not sampled! Not sure why some are considered frightening taken by themselves out of context, but what I can hear is adequately performed by a real orchestra."
4,4.5 & Recommended!,"What a good book! This was the best book that I've read this year. Jacquelyn Mitchard is a wonderful writer, very gifted in creating a world with her words. As you read, you feel that you inhabit that world and get to know the characters that live in that world. Sure, some of the characters are more fully developed than others, but so what? I see that some other reviewers thought that this book does not come up to the quality of Deep End of the Ocean & I agree, but don't let that keep you from reading this story, it's still better than 75% of what's out there! I checked to see how much I paid for this Kindle book: $3.20 and I see it's available for $2.99 right now. I sure got my money's worth and then some!"
3,"Not my favorite of hers, but still worth the read","While Breakdown Lane was not as good as I was anticipating, especially after really enjoying books like Cage of Stars, The Most Wanted and Deep End of the Ocean, it was still a good read.This book was a little slow at the beginning for me, I didn't immediately feel drawn to the characters like I normally do in a good book. But, it picked up a little ways in and the storyline kept me reading and wanting to know what was going to happen. At the same time I began to appreciate the characters in this book and their situation. (Even if a few of them I couldn't relate to or to a point makes the reader despise them.)Over-all, I liked the book and have Now You See Her on my to-read list. I think Mitchard is a unique, creative writer and would recommend her."
2,Glad I didn't Pay Full Price,This book took me forever to read! I would read it at night before I went to bed and a few pages in I'd put it to go to sleep. It took a while for the book to pick-up and once it did pick-up it slowed down pretty quickly! I recommend getting at a bargain price or from your local library!
3,"a good read, if not a great novel","Jacquelyn Mitchard's The Breakdown Lane is an entertaining read, full of emotions, but in the end it leaves the reader feeling cheated.It starts out as the story of Julianne, who loses her husband, her health, and almost her job and her children and it is here that Mitchard's skill is apparent. She gets to the heart of every situation, leaving the reader with no doubt as to what every character is feeling. Julianne's son Gabe is especially well written, and a character that will stay with you for a long time after you've finished reading.However, Mitchard ties the ending up in a neat little bow that doesn't ring true. What began as a wrenching, painful, yet absorbing read, dissolves into a generic white knight to the rescue ending. It left me thinking that Julieanne's situation deserved a better, more realistic resolution than the one she got."
4,entertaining,"I wasn't thrilled with the end but it was an entertaining book. It was a little like being a fly on the wall while someone's life was falling apart. One of those irresistable, slow down and look at the wreck, kind of things. I loved the irony of the job of the main character as a Dear Abby type columnist, giving advice to the world while hers disintigrated."
4,The Lowdown on the Breakdown,"Once again Jacquelyn Mitchard has captured and translated into words the essence of family relationships. This time, Ms. Mitchard takes her readers through the ""breakdown"" of a seemingly all together family. As the heroine, and she is a heroine, confronts spousal rejection and family dysfunctionality as well as learns to battle her worst fears, she discovers who she is and what she is capable of. She is sometimes ashamed and often angry but she is always determined. This powerful tale will encourage the discouraged and help us all to understand that life may not have fairy tale endings but it may offer surprising good endings after all."
4,The Breakdown Lane,This book was chosen as a selection for our Book Club. It was well-liked by the group who appreciated the style of writing as well as the multiple viewpoint presentation. The book generated a great deal of discussion about the mother's personality and emotional stability and there was a distinct divide of understanding between those who are not married and do not have children vs. those who do.
5,Beautiful writing,This book was so well written. The story line had me enthralled from page 1. I found myself thinking about the characters during the day and could not wait to get home to read more. I didnt want it to end. I will definitely read more from this author. I love her writing style!
4,Great Weekend Read,"This turned out to be one heck of a deal. I got it for less than four bucks off of Amazon and it was worth every penny and more! The plot was pretty juicy, with a lot of melodrama, perfect for that week when you want to eat a lot of pizza and chocolate-ladies you know what I'm talking about. What's more is the characters are very real, you will easily find yourself relating and asking, ""could that ever be me?"" Needless to say, it's fiction and Mitchard provides what I like- the fairy tale happy ending. Well as close to fairy tale as this story will allow. Because of this, the book's believability(is that even a word?) rate drops a bit, but hey, it's fiction! A good solid read, perfect for the beach, a rainy weekend, or...that time of the month."
4,Good,"This is a really good story, with a lot going on that keeps you turning the pages to find out more.I did find the fact that Julie was being dumped having just given birth and been diagnosed with MS just at the same time is bit much for one family, but I guess this happens in real life.What I thought was over the top was how the kids go looking for their dad and how they all react to his new life and the lack of accountability and responsibility that Leo (the dad) shows for it.I wish Mitchard had left out the unrealistic happy ending, that was too much for me: perfect man comes back from nowhere, loads of money, book to be published - I mean, get real! All this did take out some credibility from the rest of the book, which was otherwise very entertaining."
4,Excellent Portrayal of MS...,"Despite the ""feel good"" ending offered up in this book, I must commend the author for doing a damn good job capturing the stress, symptoms, and results from MS. I'm 35 & was diagnosed 4 yrs. ago with this disease which cost me my health, many friendships, and my job...it's an isolating prison to live in & she's done an excellent job showing the REAL sides of MS."
5,Chose to perform,"This will be a very brief review, but basically we have chosen this book to perform for or theatre studies cat. It is a really good play, and I recomend it to anyone who likes reading plays."
1,seriously?,"This is the most worthless, pointless, and boring book ever. it has no real plot or message/meaning. It is too short to be considered a book and two long to be a poem. Just stupid"
4,super sounds,"I expected great sounds from Aaron Neville and was not disappointed. His voice is like golden syrup - smooth, sweet and flows softly thru.I actually live in Tauranga new Zealand not Hamilton."
5,The story of how the whole world was impacted by one ocean,"This is a must read for any serious history advocate.In simple English, you learn why Japan and China don't own land in the US, why Russia failed here, and why Hawaii isn't british, french or Roman catholic. What happened in Europe, Russia and the US from the 1600's to present times is tied to what happened in the northern pacific. It's a world-wide lesson in riveting doses of prose and fiction that will make you read all night"
1,Don't Be Fooled,"Good news, bad news.The good news: Yes, It is aromatic cedar wood.The bad news: It's assembled in China with staples which tend to split the wood. The floor is of 1/8"" lauan plywood material (a little stronger than paste board). The dimensions are totally wrong and misleading. The actual size of the bird house is 6.5"" tall x 6.75"" wide x 7.5"" deep (that's measuring the roof, the actual house is 4.75"" x 5.75"")Shipping: It is shipped with very little packing. Mine arrived with the top cracked down the middle from being crushed.BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Cute but came with a cracked roof,The price was right - right for a birdhouse with a cracked roof. The birdhouse was shipped with a staple holding the roof together over the crack. You get what you pay for and this was very cheap.
4,Wren house recommendation,"I ordered one wren house, and when it arrived, I thought it was well made, and a reasonable price. I ordered two more. The houses are sturdy, the entrance hole is exactly the right size, and the style is appealing. Now, we have to see if the wrens agree."
2,Hole is too big for wren,"Although this birdhouse was inexpensive, it should not be advertised as a wren house. The entry hole is too big. A wren doesn't have a chance as the sparrows will definitely take residence first."
2,no bird lovers,"because of the vents on either side, the wind just blows right through. I think because of this no birds made a nest here. this was an amazon purchase."
3,Oops...not a Kit!,"We purchased this as a Christmas present for our eight year old grandson thinking it was a kit that he and grandpa could put together and complete a Cub Scout product together. It is not a kit.. shouldn't even be painted, so it didn't work for us. It was nicely made and very sturdy. Good for someone just looking for a bird house."
5,Wren house,"Best price I've seen on this adorable little house. Looks charming. I'm leaving it all natural, wonderful cedar aroma. It adds to my landscaping. Delivery was faster than expected. I'm very satisfied."
2,cedar bird house,"I was very disappointed in this bird house. The specs on this bird house stated 14 inches and that was what I was expecting, well....that was including the length of the rope!! I believe that was just a BIT misleading!!Also, inside the house the wood grain had two very bad places in it where there was wood missing from it. Also in the roof where they had stapled it together, the wood had split.It was packaged very poorly and had either bounced around quite a bit and been damaged that way or was damaged by the stapler.Very disappointing purchase.Especially since it was to be a Christmas gift for my mom and it was late getting here and we were going to her house that night for Christmas, I had no choice but to take it anyway and tell her that I would try and get it replaced.SAD, but true....."
1,broken before it even shipped??,"I just opened the box and it is broken. Ok that happens BUT on closer inspection, it looks like it was already broken and stapled back together with about eight small staples. The wood is so splintered it cannot even be glued."
2,Flawed construction,"Very disappointed. One side of the roof has a giant flaw that runs the entire length of the wood. Instead of discarding the piece,they put staples along the flaw on the outside and inside to hold the parts together. This is pitiful quality control. Will never buy another Perky-Pet house."
2,cedar birdhouse,This birdhouse is very nice but I have yet to have a bird check it out. I have it hanging in my tree and no birds will go inside.
4,"""Do You Hear the Battle Cry""","An excellent book and a must-read for the spouses of those who are in either full- or part-time ministry. Things you never considered before that your spouse might be going through. Insights to pray in a very focused way for your spouse in ministry, and perils to watch out for yourself in your ministry.Thank you Karen Blake for putting it all together. Having seen Karen and her husband in action in ministry, I can attest that she writes with a sincere heart. Karen and her husband are shining lights in what can be a very dark world of inner city ministries."
3,"Good, but not for omelets....","So I decided to try a stainless steel pan instead of a non-stick pan for omelets and got this one on Friday sale. Haven't been able to stop the egg from sticking to this pan, ruining several omelets. Tried different oils, butter and cooking spray to no avail. So, wouldn't recommend it for omelets. It's a nice size and has a great finish, and the stuck-on egg came off really easily when washed. I'd use it to saute other things that don't stick easily. Good for stir fry too."
5,Great Pan For The Price,"I went shopping for the same pan in the 12-inch size which was priced around $95.00, when I found this 10-inch version for just around $40.00. I decided to try it (knowing that, if I liked it and felt the need for the larger version, I could always add it later). I really like this pan; it is light (easy to flip ingredients), heats evenly, and very comfortable in my hand (with no need for heat protection in my bare hand). It cleans easily but does discolor, though a specialized stainless steel cleaner (like Bon Ami) and a little elbow grease will return it to like-new."
5,Very Snuggly,"These are a true size. Not too tight/not too big. Very soft and obviously quite comfortable, as I have to beg my son to change out of them! Stand up in the wash quite well."
2,Looks fake...,"This ring looked pretty on line, but it looked fake in ""person"". I tried it on, and it felt too ""chunky"" on my hand. I was disappointed, and sent it back. I still like products from this vendor, but this one didn't make the cut!"
5,Shimming Diamond CZ Ring Set,Very nice ring set. I definitely got my moneys worth and will be ordering again from evesaddiction. I received my package quickly and the customer service was great.
3,"Country Classics, Vol 2","This volume came to me missing the jacket cover, so I made one myself using the play list on the CD. That bothered me... Once again, if not for Glen Campbell, I'd probably put this one away or send it to my mother; who grew up listening to this kind of talent. Glen was superb. So much so, I'm looking for his greatest hits now. He was a miracle that too many people fail to recognize. Close your eyes and tune into Mr. Campbell. He can bring it all out and make you believe every note..."
2,Opinion of a new teacher!,"There is not much to this book--but it is ok. There are a few activities for each of the following categories: sentences, nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, capitalization and punctuation. It appears more like a book to be used at home to reinforce skills rather than lessons for a teacher to use."
2,"Good for TAPI basics, but fails in depth.","The intro to TAPI starts out well, but many in depth TAPI features are not well covered. Most noticeably missing is more than a perfunctory coverage of transmissing/receiving data through TAPI. The book's main thrust is voice emulation. This book was recommended to me, but I would have difficulty recommending to anyone else."
4,"Short, Slim, Concise, Accurate","A review consistent with the book itself:ShortSlimConciseAccurateI'd rather have this than the usual 1000+ pp. tome of redundant, inaccurate, off-topic information...what a pleasant surprise!"
4,A very good way to jump into TAPI,"With both this book and the downloadable source in hand, TAPI becomes very approachable. The only other book on TAPI I've seen is Microsoft's, and that one is horrible (sorry Microsoft). Chris takes time to show the details of TAPI, and then abstracts it with his TFX class library. It is very good stuff and very well documented code.Despite Chris's opinions of short, focused books, however, I'd like to see this book expanded to include 1) a better discussion of TAPI's event handling (I think this is just a problem with the way TAPI is structured, with all of the low-level callbacks), and 2) some more in-depth discussion of conference calls, transfers, etc. These are glossed over since support for them is thin, but I'd still like to see some more writing about this sort of thing.An excellent book, Chris; I probably would have never really gotten into TAPI without your instruction."
5,Excellent explanation of TAPI and background,"The book starts by giving some background information on TAPI, then explains how TAPI works. The examples are for MFC, but can be adapted to plain C++, mostly not to difficult. For me, experienced in C++ (not MFC but Borland's OWL) but never done any telephony work, this book was exactly what I was looking for. C++ experience is mandatory, Visual Basic will not do with this book."
2,Didn't Reach Full Potential,"It had all the factors for a great story: The drama, a prohibited love and a new perspective...a guy's perspective. I guess it was nice to view things in a guy's P.O.V (point of view)but it didn't change the fact that the actual development of the story didn't reach its full potential. I was disappointed when i finished it, not because it completely sucked but because more could have been done to it. Many of the characters annoyed me, like Wanda, Norma and Jeff's mom, but its all part of the story.The level of Jeff and Ellen's romance was G rated, which collided with the gravity of the drama Jeff's family was going through. I mean, Sachs even included suicide, a touchy subject, but Jeff and Ellen's physical progress didn't advance much which made it seem like they were fifteen years old, not seventeen. It had a good story plot but not a good storytellng."
4,"Weird Concept, Well Executed","Interesting film. Oddly enough, I stumbled across this film at a local library! I read the premise and had to see how this was executed.It's filmed very amateur style, but not poorly. The fact that it's black and white I think adds to it. There are some really nice looking shots, as well as some truly creepy ones. The acting is well...hard to say. It really comes off as if everyone is just being themselves, but not in a way that looks bad. It almost feels like a home movie instead of a real film. I think in this way, it makes the events that unfold have that much more of an impact on you.I only have 2 complaints: 1. It moves a bit slow at parts. 2. The killing scenes aren't very well filmed, especially the 2nd. All in all, it's an interesting concept and I feel it's worth checking out. The fact that there are 2 actual handicapped people in the film is neat. Make sure to check out the interviews as well, very good stuff."
4,The textbook for beginer of cataract surgery,"This book explains basic surgical technique such as extracapsular cataract extraction, intracapsular cataract extraction, phacoemulsification, secondary IOL implantation, combined surgery, and complication of cataract surgery easily. This book is essential to ophthalmologist in my opinion. The Korean Ophthalmological Society chose this book for textbook of cataract surgery."
3,Cheaper at the toy store,"It's a great toy, but be careful buying on line. I paid almost $8.00 in shipping fot this 5.99 toy. Totaling nearly 14.00. It would've been more cost effective to drive the 18 miles to my nearest Toys R Us."
2,"Not good as a movie, but good documentary information.","I like the soundtrack though. Check Lil' Rick aka RICKY RUCKUS on 2 songs: 1) Collision, and 2) NOW"
4,Delightfully cute and easy to read,"Bertie Byrd is your typical Mayberry RFD tomboy, with a heart of gold and a wonderful sense of humor. She isn't so lucky in love and she's beginning to wonder if she ever will be. But the ins and outs of her every day life as written in the first person, are filled with humor, delightful scenarios, and a taste of melancholy where her parents are concerned. I don't know when I've enjoyed such a light-hearted read so much, and was so pleased with the ending. Dolores J. Wilson must have a heart of gold and it shows in her writing. I'll be looking to buy her next novel when it's published in December."
5,Loved It!,"I laughed outloud throughout most of the book & thought this would make a fantastic ""country sitcom"" for television! Bertie is someone I would like to know! Be prepared to laugh!"
4,She's old... so old... she creaks... and pops....,"An average MST 3K, hillarious in some parts, a little dull in others, but the good parts are worth the 4 stars alone. The main focus of joke-making in this episode is the music and the horrible british accents. A great episode for MST 3K fans, but if you're new to the show, start with a better episode."
3,"""There's a girl on the roof and she thinks she's a cat...""","Interesting little piece of stereotyping and misunderstanding of atomic energy, with just enough nudity to draw the average male viewer. The mad scientist in the movie is suitably into his work, and the basic plot moves along well enough to somewhat obscure the characters' basic nullity. The skits had almost nothing to do with the movie, and it was at about this time that the invention exchanges were ready to be pulled (and it shows), but it was nice that Magic Voice got a chance to star for once.The actual movie just didn't make the most of its cast (With a zombie, a dog-man, and a cat-woman around, why pay all that attention to an aging gigolo?), but I think this one paid off at least average all the same. Could have done with more mad science stuff and somewhat less pronounced accents.""In retrospect, an obvious mistake."""
4,The Non-Atomic Brains,"In The Atomic Brain, there is no atomic brain. A terrifically funny one. A woman wants her brain in the body of one of three young girls specially selected. Oh, boy. Not to mention the eating of a live mouse during the film."
4,An excellent translation of Chinese poems.,"I have been a lover of poetry for most of my life. My favorite type of poetry is Japanese; however, I have grown to also love Chinese poetry. This fantastic book provides a series of Chinese poems that are both beautiful and meaningful. In most cases, Chinese poetry seems to have longer verses than Japanese poetry, but fortunately, they are still shorter than most western poetry. I have found myself reading this text numerous times because of the beauty and symmetry of the poetry. In conclusion, this book should be in the collection of everyone who loves Asian poetry. Rating: 4 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Season of the Warrior: A poetic tribute to warriors)"
1,Deceiving title description!!,"The title of this product should not state LARGE 13 1/2 INCH when in fact the scoop is really only 5 inches!! From the end of the handle to the end of the scoop is 14 inches, but you only know this if you read the product description dimensions. There is nothing about this scoop that is large and nothing about this scoop that is 13 1/2 inches! Another scoop I bought that had the correct title description was much bigger than this one!"
4,Great strainer,"I really like the WMF line of kitchen utensils. They're attractive, easily cleaned (dishwasher safe), and made of 18/10 stainless. With few exceptions, I also find their designs to be the most functional (for tongs, go with Rosle). This particular strainer doesn't allow any liquids to get trapped when you pick up the food.Knocking a point off because they're made in China. I would gladly pay more to see Germany stamped on the metal, rather than a China sticker."
5,Another Perfect Kitchen Gaget.,Perfect! Drains without leaving excess grease. Stainless steele makies it easy to clean. Perfect for wing day. A must have.
4,not as big as I'd hoped,"I know this is my fault, because I probably should have read the dimensions better, I just thought it would be bigger. Works great though!"
5,A quintessential purchase,Yeah I know you can get Oh Yeah on god knows how many bloody 80s compilations but this is still a worthwhile purchase because with tracks such as Domingo and Bananas To The Beat along side the brilliant Vicious Games and I Love You.....there really is nothing more for you than to pick up a copy.
2,Tedious,"I have to agree with the other reviewer, the advertising blurbs and labelling are very misleading. I normally find White Wolf books a bit slow paced. This book had almost no action in it until the last 50 pages. The rest was a long demonstration of the political and social attributes of the Michigan (except Detroit) vampire clans. They tend to behave and act like gangsters rather than creatures of the supernatural. Just not my piece of cake. Since I live in the area the book focuses on I found the setting badly misses the flavor of southern Michigan. I know it's an 'alternate' world but the author has failed to create an environment with any element of interest. This is a firm 'do not buy.'"
2,"hey, wait a minute...","I bought this book hoping for a good hunter story. If this is what you are expecting, don't buy this book. I'm a big White Wolf fan, but I found this book just boring. Other than providing a little background information on the White Wolf world, this book is pointless. Not enough action, poor character development, over kill on the drama and politics of the Vampire world. If you're a big fan of White Wolf's other Vampire stuff you might want to get this one to help kill some time...."
2,are vamps in the midwest just dull?,"I have to agree with the negative reviews of this book, I have read the 13 clan novels, multiple anthologies, own all the core game books, and the box set of the show and all I have to say is...what the hell was this? The characters were paper thin and way over sensitive, the clans and the whole camarilla was set up awkwardly, overall it just lacked. This especially since its during the wars on the East Coast! All those vamps are running around and killing stuff, and these guys are twidling their thumbs and plotting ugh."
5,A ribald Huck Finn for the 'crikits',"Seelye's tongue-in-cheek rewriting of Twain's classic is a joy to read, in no small part because his Huck as engaging as Twain's. Seelye's project is largely critical discourse--as Huck's introduction to this edition makes clear--but of the best sort. In allowing ""the real Huck"" to write his own book, Seelye compels us to see the beauty of Twain's. Seelye's Huck cusses and fantasizes in ways that seem natural to readers today but that would have shocked readers in Twain's day. But if his characters are more realistic than Twain's, we see in Seelye's ending just why Twain was compelled to compose such a frustrating close for his novel. A book for all fans of Twain, or Huck. See Seelye's _The Kid_ for a different take on similar themes, Huck Finn and Jim in the Territory."

3,I won't pay $$$$$ for a superb series,"The only reason I rated this is superb series 3 stars is because of the exorbitant price Amazon has the audacity to charge.I was introduced to ""Wind At My Back"" on INSP. It is a wonderful family series. Set in Canada gives a different pleasant perspective from traditional American television programs. The ""catty"" characters are written as wonderful antithesis to the charitable kind characters.Lower the price Amazon & this series might go on my Wish List."
3,Average,"After reading the reviews for this tree stand I thought this would be so easy. To be honest it was kind of a pain in the ass. The stand works fine, works like it says, but it's hard to get the tree to stand level. Tightening each individual screw while laying under a Christmas tree isn't all that easy. I still like the stand because of the 1 gallon reservoir for water, but there has got to be something easier to use out there."
4,One of the Best!,"This is one of my fave Almodovar films, and underrated gem...and it DOES have English subtitles..hard to find movie!"
1,Probably Worst Movie by Almadovar,"After viewing VOLVER & ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER y recently purchased KIKA. What a dissapointment it was. The movie does not have the phsycological twist and plot his other movies have. The jokes were tasteless and not funny at all. I have watched many movies from Spain and have laughed a lot. This movie is a waste of time. I can't believe the positive reviews and how can a rape scene be funny it is at the least disrespectfull to all victims. Humor negro (dark humor) is not about making fun of tragedies, believe me I have seen numerous movies with it and they have never been so vulgar and offensive.I am just being honest. NO subtitles, but I am fluent in Spanish. Trust me watch something else."
3,"Excellent content, turgid prose","Professor Stigler is an academic, and writes like one. He is obviously knowledgeable; this book will appeal to professional statisticians.For intelligent laymen with a general interest in the history of statistics,Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Riskby Peter Bernstein andThe Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Centuryby David Salsburg will be equally informative and far more enjoyable. Both authors are as knowledgeable as Professor Stigler, but write more clearly."
4,Where to Buy this...,"This is a great little book with succinct descriptions of a pile of activities that can be run with no props. If you'd like to find a copy, check with the publisher - Project Adventure, Inc. They still sell it NEW for $20. Used copies in recent years are often mislabeled ""rare"" and marked up to absurd prices."
5,The best meat pan for your money!,"This pan was highly recommended by America's Test Kitchen, and they were not kidding! The wide bottom holds a lot of meat and browns it nicely, with hardly any sticking. Retains heat better than my nonstick pan. Larger cuts such as whole pork tenderloins and thick-cut pork chops can go straight from stove-top searing to oven-roasting. Not too heavy, and very smooth at the bottom - great for glass-top stoves! Cleans up nicely, too. This will be your no. 1 pan for browning meat!"
1,Don't get it!,"What a disappointment! My daughter got this for my son for his birthday. It's a piece of junk. The ""night sky"" is made of cheap cardboard that you have to poke hole in to make the constellations. Then you must tape it all together with double sided tape. The top part does not stay on at all. Plus you put the cardboard pieces on top of the light bulb that you have to press to turn on. So you have to take it apart to turn the light bulb on.He's had it for about 2 weeks and has turned it on once.....and the kid loves the stars and constellations.Like I said before, do not get it. It is a major let down. :-("
4,Book received and leaving comments,Received book in good condition and the price was good. Pages yellow with age. Got it for a kid to read and enjoy. Love to give books to kids to enjoy and sure that the kid who reads this will enjoy it. Thanks! Purchased this on Amazon and well pleased with the book.
2,I would give the first 1/3 four stars if I could...,"""The Skin I'm In"" is fabulous, but I don't think this lives up to it at all. The first third of Bang! is an excellent evocation of a family and a neighborhood in decline.After that, the book itself declines into unbelievable, author-directed silliness. Even if everything that happens to Mann after his father abandons him in the country is taken at face value, I find it impossible to believe that for a whole month no family member and no person in authority thought to look for the boy at the stable where he loved to go daily. A stable that became convienently empty just in time for him to move into it.And to call the child Mann when the whole book is about rites of passage into manhood is just ludicrous. The final scenes of supposed redemption between Mann and his father are some of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes I have even read in fiction of any type.The many messages of the novel are worthy, but the novel itself is quite flawed."
2,Donald Goines Flashback,"I read a book by Donald Goines about a raped woman and the whole time I was reading it, I was thinking ""Why in the world would someone write a book like this?"" As much as I love all of Flake's other books, that's the exact same thing I was thinking about this book. The book started off very interesting about how one brother deals with another brother's death, and it reminded me of a cousin which gave me good and bad memories. But then the book launched off into this twisted relationship between the living brother and his father. This book deeply disturbed me during the camping ""results"" and after that it just became so off-the-wall. I started questioning my donations to homeless people and who really needs it. I can't say the book was bad...it just wasn't for me...and definitely an extreme difference from the other books that I've read by Flake."
3,Okay,"I found the first part of the book to be extraordinay. The death of the main character's little brother in a drive by and the way the family reacts to it seem to me to be spot on. Unfortunately, a number of our students have had relatives and friends shot and/or killed. However, the part of the book in which the main character and his friend are left in the forest to be taught what it is to be a man rings a little false. Wouldn't somebody notice these kids were missing? Wouldn't the authorities be called in? That said, my students virtually inhale Ms Flake's books, and this one is no different in that regard. Maybe, as an adult, I thought about things a teen would over look."
5,The best book ever,This book is wonderful. If your a teenager then you can reality to what this book means and why it is so great to read. Sharon Flake is a great Arthur and every one should read this book
1,Better Brownies are out there...,"These brownies had a strange wet texture, as if they weren't completely cooked. I am a brownie fan, and I must say I was very disappointed with this product. I have since tried other companies, and believe me when I say that there are much better brownies that are much more worthy of your dollar available out there."
2,wow....,"i looked at the date on this mother. it says 2002. thats back when it was still okay to suck at guitar. its a fun read if you like remembering that era. some of these bands i've forgotten about actually. and at the drive ib isn't nu metal. nor is tool or primus. but what ever. it glorifies a fallen genre. but like i said, it was done in 02. if it were written a few years later it would have turned out differently..."
5,Learned so much!!,"I purchased this at a crafting workshop. I love it!! It's very simple, even for beginners.My daughter's just love the Teddy's I have made for them."
3,Useful and practical,"Recipes, lore, activities, ideas.... all you must have handy to celebrate your sabbat with your family and friend.Chapters on every sabbats are not too long so they won't let you confused with loads of conflicting projects, it's direct, simple and straight to the point. An useful purchase for any witch."
2,"It's a pull cart, not a push cart","Item is not sold as pictured. The wheels are 180' opposite. So you have to pull it and can't push it because the turning wheels are on the other end, which makes it difficult to use. Now I know why the price is so low, the manufacturer made a mistake. I contacted the company and they were very nice and responded quickly, only to deliver a cart frame welded the same incorrect way."
4,Very Useful Cart,"We purchased this for using around our property. Item was shipped in a reasonable time. It is good quality construction. I feel the price of the cart was good. Due to the weight of this item, shipping was via Fed-Ex Freight, so it added another $70 or so (about 1/2 the cost of the cart). I was less than impressed with the directions. I gave this to my son to assemble, and things did not match up. Hardware seemed to be either wrong or missing, based on what was shown in the parts list. When he asked for help, it only took a few minutes to assemble. They've changed the way this is assembled. Some nuts are no longer needed as they are either welded to the cart, or the piece is tapped and threaded. Some bolt sizes have changed too. I would prefer to have the wheels on the rear of the cart. Still, we're happy with it."
4,"close to good, buth no sigar ;as Evan HUNTER would say","Fine and suspencefull movie from a good Ed McBain novel-buth as always:the book is better. Randy Quaid is no Steve Carella and also Bert Kling is not well typed. Plot is O.K. buth movie could be more complete or complex ,as the book is. Buth all McBain is welcome-even to compare with other McBain items."
2,Im coming to get you! Ha!Ha!Ha!Ha!Ha!Ha!,Whisper Kill wasn't the best movie but it was ok. The story didn't made sence but when I watched the movie over and over again then It started to make sence.I wouldn't call this a horror movie but a drama movie.It showed that a killer has feelings in this movie.This film was not rated but to me it should be rated PG-13 or rated R.This movie was like the movie Scream but a 1988 version.I reccomend if you rent this movie than buy the movie.
2,Ok as a TV Tuner but bad for Playing games,"This is an ok product for watching tv on your pc, but when it comes to playing your game through your LCD monitor it isnt any good.Well, i hope that im not doing anything wrong, or probably there is some configurations that i didnt do. I plug this unit to my 22"" LCD monitor to play my Playstation 3 games, but the quality that i got made my eyes water with discomfort. I have only had it for two weeks, so i will trying searching the internet for any solutions, to find out whether its a problem that could be fixed, or its just crappy quality from this product."
3,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a tuner that ran through Windows and could also be used to transfer VHS to DVD. This is just a small cable box that goes in between the PC video outputs and the monitor. It makes your monitor into a basic 78 channel cable TV set, totally independent of the PC. It would probably work even if the PC isn't turned on. I haven't been able to get the picture in picture to work, so I can't use the PC while this is on. So I can't even work on the PC with TV in a window. The product works well as designed, just not what I wanted."
4,wonderful for my system,"I have cable TV, DVD, X Box and a proyector. It would have been a nightmare to connect them all up without my TV Box. I bought it because I needed a TV Tuner but it does much more than that with all the connections it is capable of. The only thing that is a bit uncomfortable is the audio plugs. Its one miniplug audio in and one miniplug audio out. So I had to figure out a way to connect my 5.1 system. Which I did but was not so simple."
4,Very good- could be better,"I love this machine, it plays tv with your computer off or on.Pros- Little screen while on computer(pip) with sound either on comp.or tv- sleep mode- remote with several buttonsand many moreCons- Tv tuner doesn't have same channels as regular tv for me- the system itself has very few buttons- less than the remote- the sytem has a very bright blue light when it is onI would advise purchasing this product- but be aware- it is not perfect."
1,A ten year old goes to Provence,This book is written like a fourth grader telling about their summer vacation. I was very disappointed in the content and the shallowness of the text.
1,Pretentious,This wasn't the book I was hoping it would be. Probably more appropriate for the older country club set than a couple of twenty-somethings. I got a lot more use out of the more traditional travel guides.
5,On the Mark,"This is my all-time favorite guide book to the most delightful vacation spot. The suggestions offered are right on the mark. I haven't had the opportunity to use them all yet, but those I've followed (Mougins, Antibes, Vence, Avignon) are exactly as the author describes, replete with charm. I've given copies to a number of very satisfied friends. I look forward to the day I can return, Orgasmic Days in hand, and visit all the inviting, esoteric areas I haven't found in other travel guides to the area."
1,"""Fun""","This is a terribly written book. The name dropping of every restaurant owner and spouse by first name is obnoxious, the tone is pretentious, and the prose is limited at best with repetitious phrases and most everything described simply as ""fun"". We received the book the day we were leaving and packed it without examination. We ditched it at our first hotel. There are many much more informative, well written, and less superficial guidebooks to the south of France. Waste not your money on this one."
1,Garbage...,"Unfortunately this product was DOA. It says it uses a recycled battery. Something tells me this may have something to do with it. No lights regardless of how long you charge it. Doesn't work. Very poorly built, would avoid it at all costs and get a better headset."
5,My family love Mulan II,"My 9 yrs old daughter wanted Mulan II DVD for Christmas this year, and so we got it for her, and she was so happy! We watched it on Christmas eve and Christmas Day, and it does not stop there. My children know the songs and lines in the movie, and it is such a joy to know that when they are happy, I am happy!"
4,Mulan II,My Son loves ths movie even more than Mulan 1. It has a few less scary parts to it and he enjoys seeing the carriage scene over and over.
4,Mulan follow-up,"Cute movie, but kind of cheesey (animation not on the same level as the original movie). Granddaughter loves it, though!"
2,Lacks Charm of the First Movie,"Grade: C+Average, lacking the charm and feminism (the ONE Disney movie), this movie focuses on opposistes and love and partnerships. The first scene in the field is inexplainably uncomfortable to watch, the lyrics make me cringe. It does have an element of Chinese values in it, but I wouldn't know.As far as Disney sequels go, a winner. But that's not too much."
3,"The ending was cute, but left much to be desired.","The reviews provided by other users pretty much sums up my feeling about this movie - good and bad. It's decent enough.My only problem with the film content is the flawed ending. No solution was implemented that would form the desired alliance between the two kingdoms, and without that, military force was said to have been predicted. Since the two kingdoms aren't united, we never know how the Emperor of the Middle Kingdom deals with this issue. Instead, the ending is quite Disney-esque, as would be expected. It just leaves that one mystery unsolved.The songs were not memorable, but at least they brought back the ""A Girl Worth Fighting For"" to tie the first movie and its sequel together. Oh, and Mushu is nothing without Eddie Murphy."
1,don't waste your money,"This movie was just no good. Mushu is being totally sneaky & trying to wreck Mulan's marriage, the acting/voiceovers are terrible & I'm not even sure that all of them are from the first movie, and the theme is really very adult...the differing roles in society of men and women. That aside, it's just boring. If you were expecting the humor, drama, and excitement of the first one, forget it. Skip this one & watch the first one again."
4,Mulan 2,"My daughter loves Mulan so of course I had to buy this, she insisted on it. Its not too bad as far as straight to DVD sequels go. I've seen worse."
4,Good Sequel,"Myself and my daughter loved Mulan and like many of others do not care much for sequels because they are never that good. But Mulan 2 is an exception. It is entertaining and my daughter loves it. I think she has seen it 8 times or more the first weekend! So if you don't mind your child watching this DVD over and over, get it for them."
4,Fun,"I am a huge fan of Disney's MULAN Special Edition DVD. The only thing that disappoined me was the DVD for MULAN II did NOT provide a ""Mandarin/Chinese"" audio track. Mulan did."
3,A Good Sequel...Kids seem to love it,I watched this DVD with my neices (ages 7 and 9)...and they watched it 5 times in the course of one weekend. It was well done and can stand alone as a movie by itself in it's own right. I don't think it is as good as the original but the kids didn't seem to care and loved it. I gave it 3 stars just because I only liked it...the kids would probably have given it a 5. There are games also that can be played through the DVD player...and the kids played them. It kept them busy for about 1/2 hour after watching the movie. And like I said before...they wanted to watch it over and over again. It's worth buying if you have little ones and it is worth a Disney collectors collection.
4,Great sequel!,"Mulan is one of my very favorite Disney movies, so I bought Mulan 2 for my children to enjoy. Although it is not the same quality animation as the first, it is still an enjoyable movie. Overall, I would recommend this movie over other Disney sequels."
3,What happened?,"Between the first Mulan film and this one there seems to be some serious disconnects. Much of what made the original Mulan so charming is in this one too... but somehow the film just never seems to ""click."" Instead it just seems to plod along.Pity... the whole Yin and Yang thing had the potential to pull the whole thing together as a plot device but instead it was never allowed to be the central part of the story."
3,My duty is to my heart......................................,"It's only been a month since China was under attack. Fa Mulan is back and her family is anticpating a wedding proposal from General Lee Shang.As the two set out on a new adventure with some of the old gang and three princess the differences between ying and yang are brought about with Mushu Mulan's dragon who is trying to keep his pedestal at any cost!Are Mulan, and Shang prepared to weather the sun and rain to happily ever after?I loved the songs they sang...""A girl worth fighting for"" ""I want to be like other girls""I don't think that this movie was as strong as part 1, but I do believe that the message was just as clear. As usual Jade and Marquis LOVED THIS! I liked it."
1,Incredibly cheesy,"This is the cheesiest sequel that I've ever seen. It was so cheesy that I was literally falling off my chair laughing. Every line is either so far out there that it makes no sense or feels completely out of place, and the characters are not developed well at all. It was a good laughing movie, but it isn't because it is funny. The movie is so ludacris that one can't help but laugh. Completely ridiculous. If you're in the mood to laugh at something stupid, I would highly recommend this film. It made my night."
3,Cute,I thought that the movie Mulan 2 was cute. The movie had parts that made me laugh. I did see a change in the personality of Mulan maybe because of her marriage to Shang. I didn't care for the music in the movie but I didn't care for the music in the first movie. I enjoyed watching this movie because I thought it was sweet watching the three soldiers get to know the princesses.
3,"disappointing, and I didn't like the message","I love Mulan, and hoped this sequel would be as good, but it is a far cry. The story is indeed predictable, and as mentioned in another review, one of the heros ""dies"" but you know he can't be dead. Also, they don't really explain how he survived, and it's pretty implausible, even for a little kid.Mostly, I was disturbed by the very clear and oft repeated message that ""your duty is to your heart"". So, even if people will die, even if you gave your solemn word, even if it means breaking rules, do what your heart tells you - in this case, for a person you have never even actually spoken too, just ""shared a cosmic moment"". I don't think that's a good message for kids to get, especially considering the ""If it feels good, do it"" society we already live in."
1,unhappy customer,We were unable to view the movie as there is something wrong with the DVD. Tried contacting company directly and no response from the company.
5,Almost perfect!,"I love how the message flows, but at some parts, it seemed like as if the movie is skipping some parts in some situation. It's going a little too fast...needs to be longer. I love the movie though!"
1,Can I give it negative stars?,"I'm actually watching this right now. I got as far as Mushu turning Shang into a bumbling idiot and started writing this. Just after you know, that whole, ""My duty is to my heart!"" line from Mulan.I want this movie to be over so bad. It is a terrible movie. A wagon just crashed off a cliff and noone died. I had my fingers crossed that they all died and the credits would start rolling. Disney, what on earth were you thinking? This is awful. This is one of the worst things I've seen in a long time, and I sat through John Carter all the way.Thank god I rented this thing so I don't have to deal with it in my library of movies.Oh my god, Mulan just said ""What is it with men and asking directions?!"" to her fiance. To SHANG of all people.This movie needs to be fried. This is just so terrible."
4,"Mushu's back, baby!","In Mulan II Mulan and Shang must, for the sake of peace, accompany three Chinese princesses to arranged marriages. On the journey Mulan begins to doubt the mission. Off course she doesn't wish for war, but isn't love worth protecting as well?The story of Mulan II is a bit weak, but unlike many other Disney sequels the drawings is almost as good as the first movie. There are some nice songs and the princesses' song ""I wanna be like other girls"" is great. I saw this movie just before Christmas and I still know that song by heart.I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you liked the first Mulan you'll like this one too."
3,A fun movie for the kids,"Not every movie needs a sequel. They could have incorporated a marriage story line in the original. That said, my kids liked it."
1,Unplayable,"I was sent a DVD that does not play in the USA. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter. When she received it she wanted to play it right away. When it did not work, she was in tears. Total disaster. Very disappointed!"
3,Audio quality was poor,"Played it on laptop. Movie clarity was good, but the audio was very dim, even with volume at full blast. Need external speakers for good viewing."
2,A disappointing sequel,"I loved the first Mulan, as did my daughter. Which made it particularly heart breaking that the second Mulan lacked beleivable characterization, decent animation, and a coherent ending.The characters and settings were not as expressive or richly drawn as in the original. The characters lost a great deal of the depth that we saw in the first movie. And the songs did not live up to the Disney name.On the plus side, my 2.5 year old daughter liked it fine, but it lacks the crossover appeal to adults that makes for good kids movies. I was quite happy I didn't buy this, and would only suggest renting this if you have a child that isn't looking for depth of animation or characters."
2,Horrible....,"This sequel to 'Mulan' was poorly done. The songs became random and didn't really help the plot. The whole follow your heart stuff was not what Mulan did in the first movie, maybe just a little bit, but it didn't exactly help her.Mushu became selfish and they completely ruined him. I suggest that if you liked Mushu in the first movie you stay away from this one.Everything in this movie was completely predictable and expected. It had little suspense, if any. This sequel wasn't very funny and as mentioned in the beginning, the songs were horrible.I wish Disney could make sequels that don't ruin the first movies, oh well, I guess they're running out of ideas."
3,Only good for your little ones,The first installment was great entertainment for the entire family.Mulan II will probably put you to sleep if you are not under 10 years old.Good movie for the little ones though.
1,Crap!,Definitely not the quality of the first one! Definitely do not recommend anyone purchase this mpvie. I wish disney would actually TRY with these sequels!
3,"Could be better, could be alot worse","This DVD was released in Australia on the 10th of november, no idea why its so much earlier than the states (its usually the other way around).Anyway for direct to video fare this is pretty good. I thought the theme of the movie was quite good (peoples differences can make them stronger), but its handled with all the subtly of throwing a brick through a window. All the best characters are back and there are some genuinely moving moments and good humour. The songs don't compare with the first movie and the animation isn't as good, but I found it enjoyable."
1,Mulan II Stinks !!!!!,"I hated this movie. It was awful. First of all, Mushu (which is one of my favorite characters) was so self-centered,and annoying. Second, that Shang was even meaner than the first movie. I hate him!! Third, Mulan did not seem like the Mulan in the first movie. DO NOT BUY THIS STINKIN' DISNEY SEQUEL!!!!"
1,An Hour of my Life I will Never Get Back,"I consider myself a fun and reasonable person. I loved Mulan, and thought we couldn't go wrong with this movie. I couldn't even nap through the flick it was so distractingly horrendous!"
4,"Not a theatre release, but still a good sequel :)","I found this dvd to be a worthy sequel to the first Mulan movie, with great animation, cute songs, and a cute story line. Sure I would have liked to see a scene of Mulan's wedding, or the three princess's get married to the three goofy soldiers, but other than that I was pleased. Sure the tiny dragon was annoying, but so was he in the first movie. I think people had way too high expectations for this release, and they need to accept it for what it is. Good Disney fun!"
2,"Lemme' Hear Ya' Say ""PREDICTABLE""!!","Yes, it was cute. Yes, it was interesting. YES, I'm sure little kids will enjoy it. But for all you original 'Mulan' fans, this will be a big let down. The plot is (as metioned by earlier reviewers) absolutely predictable. And Disney seems to be suffering from an acute case of SSSS or, ""Sugary-Sweet Sequel Syndrome"". It only briefly offers any drama--the rest of the time we are all given cute and sappy love moments (how do the princesses and gaurds fall THAT head-over-heels in love in just THREE DAYS??), Mushu's 'clever' yet bumbling schemes, and the ever over-used ""Be True To Your Heart"" line. I think Disney should have been true to the original."
3,hope it will be good,"i was really excited when i found out that there is a mulan 2, but then i read somewhere that someone thought that shang dies.could someone please correct me if i'm wrong?!i would really like to see this movie if that TERRIBLE fact isn't true."
2,Nice Try But Doesn't Quite Do it,I was really looking forward to Mulan 2. Hoping for a good sequel. But alas not so. The storyline was so predictable. It was like reading a roadmap. You knew all the stops on the way. There was no real surprises and didn't have to see the entire movie to know the outcome. However the dragon was his usually funny self. His role brighten the movie. If you are a true-die hard Mulan fan. Stick with the original.
5,excelent,"I was so pleased with this product as was my Son,we can't believe how quickly it arrived.Living in England it is a good way to send treatts to my Grandchildren,I will most definately be using your services again and again,well done and thank you."
1,Una completa basura,"Si Mulan 1 fué divertida, esta secuela es particularmente mala... las canciones, la historia, el final. Esta producción debe estar hecha para niños pequeños o retrasados mentales. En esta nueva entrega Mulan pasa a ser un personaje SECUNDARIO. La película no refleja NADA de las costumbres chinas y por cierto... a Mulán le encargan salvar a China, cosa que nunca hace y al final ni quien se acuerde de ello.Una porquería que desvirtua a l aprimera parte."
4,mulan again !!,"i've seen mulan , the first one it was pretty nice i liked it alot.like all disney sequels i think this one's going to be pretty nice , different of course but nice."
3,Cosmic Jokers - 'Gilles Zeitschiff' (Spalax),"Yet,another 1974 title of the Cosmic Jokers.Although it isn't quite AS good as either the self-titled Cosmic Jokers effort or the 'Galactic Supermarket'(see my reviews of both),it's still decent.Obviously not a krautrock classic,but most fans of such should get something out of this CD reissue.Tracks I dug the most were ""Cosmic Courier Bon Chance"",the eleven-minute adventurous ""Electronic Rock Zeitalter"" and ""De Magier"".Line-up:Klaus Schulze-electronics,Gille Lettman-vocals,Manuel Gottsching-guitar,Jurgen Dollase-keyboards,Dieter Dierks-bass and Harold Grosskopf-drums.Good to take out for a spin occasionally."
3,Great show......,"Great concert!, however, the quality of the dvd is incredibly poor. It is just like a bad copy of the original dvd. Price too high for a very low quality dvd."
1,Import = Cheap Chinese Knockoff,"The content is great, but this is an expensive (default Chinese subtitled) knockoff of the show."
5,Hey Mr Producer,This show has lost nothing over time since 1995 and I would recommend it to anyone The stars are still shining
1,Broken product,"Hey Mr. Producer is a wonderful DVD..... when the DVD works. I believe this DVD came from China. It never stated this was for a PAL system. It also would not play. I just so happen to have a NTSC and PAL player. So the product was broken and for the price I paid, it is very sad."
3,Double DVD is a bad design,"We bought this for our kids, because it has a french language track. My kids all love the DVDs, but I have to admit that the double-sided DVD is a very bad idea. There is no way to protect one side or the other. I just ""repaired"" side B, and hopefully it will work again. Of course, my oldests favorite episode was the one that was scratched & damaged. I think they could have splurged a little on the cost and given us 3 DVDs."
1,"Okay for children, unwatchable for adults.","This series of Superman cartoons can best be summed up by saying it's only written for children. Do not expect any interesting plot twists, surprise endings or character development. Every story is simply a predictable sequence of simple action events. If you enjoy watching any complexity or originality in comics stories, don't get this. Animation is subpar, visuals are very grainy and the audio quality is so-so. The opening and main theme are very bland and unmemorable. This appears to be one of the last hand-drawn cartoon of superheroes ever produced. It is nowhere as good as Batman the animated series which was also hand-drawn. it's a real stinker. I'm glad I paid only four bucks for this and really it's not worth the money I spent. I couldn't watch no more than three episodes before I turned it off."
3,Lost episodes???,"I'm surprised no one else mentioned but one person that these are not all of the episodes from the series. They are leaving out two of the best ""mini-series"" from the show. Someone else mentioned the Apokolips three-parter, and they also left off the ""ending of the show"" ""LEGACY""? Those were some of the best episodes, why are they not on any of the Superman:animated series boxsets??? Will they release them later, or are they just LOST FOREVER??? That's what I don't understand, I was finally looking forward to seeing those on dvd. That's the only reason I give this set 3 stars, not 5. Its not COMPLETED. WB has done a poor job of marketing BTAS, AND S:AS. If anyone has information on this write an updated review."
4,This Is Super!!!!,"The item shipped very quickly, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this item to a friend."
3,Not as good as Batman,"This is a fun and watchable series, but it lacks the depth and complexity of Batman. It's not the writer's fault. Batman is both a fighter and detective. Superman, on the other hand, uses pure brute strength to defeat his villains. Most of the episodes feature flavor of the week villains. Since Superman's only weakness is kryptonite, there's no real suspense since you know Superman's going to win. Batman, on the other hand, comes up with creative ways to defeat his villains. The only episodes I truly enjoyed were the crossover episodes with Batman and the Darkseid episode, since Superman finally fought someone who was on his level. This DVD is worth buying, but it's not a masterpiece like Batman."
5,Mxyzpixilated,"My favorite episode on volume 2 is undoubtly ""Mxyzpixilated"". The most (probably only) humorous episode of the series. I love the ""robot building montage"", w/ the ""George, Relish, & Pants being months"" gag. There's also a VIDEO commentary on this episode (way better than the one on ""Batman: TAS Volume 3"", which happens to be recorded in Paul Dini's apartment). Other great episodes include the shocking story ""The Late Mr. Kent"" & the fan-favorite ""World's Finest"". I totally recommend this set, along w/ ""Superman Vol. 1"" & ""Batman: TAS Vol. 1-4"""
5,England Rugby Training Ball,"Excellent training ball... well constructed, 4 panel leather. Suitable for all weather conditions. It is still in good shape after being used in the snow, spring mud and summer of Maine. If you're an England Rugby supporter, this is a nice quality ball for $30.00."
5,Great First Outing!,"This is a fabulous & funny read from the early forties, by one of the great wits of the modern age. If you're unfamiliar with Levant, dive right in. If you're familiar with him but haven't read this book, you are in for quite a treat. Side Note: It is referred to and featured in Israel Horovitz's play ""The Chopin Playoffs"", the third play in a trilogy about Jews in Canada in the thirties & forties."
3,Interesting for hardcore musical fans,"This isn't the most exciting book I've read but if you're a hardcore musical theatre fan, it's worth a read. Many of the author's arguments -- pretty much seeing lesbian overtones EVERYWHERE -- are a bit silly, but she also makes some good points. It's a point of view we rarely hear so that's worth something, and may get some people thinking about musicals differently, which is worthwhile..."
3,it works,"It works after some hacksawing. The holes drilled into the block don't match up with the little tabs on the saw. Had to file them. This block caused my saw to vibrate like a vegas bed. I cut off the tabs and now the wheels of the saw are back in plane and the vibration is gone. What else can I say, it's a 6"" riser. It does what it needs to do after some re-engineering."
1,Purchase from wish list - Grizzley Riser Block Kit,"I had to return item. It was purchased as a gift from his wish list. The tool I ordered could not be used without the purchase of another item on the list. He did not get that item and could not afford to purchase it himself, therefore it was returned. This will be the last time I purchase from a wish list for other people. The company charged a 10% restocking fee, they did not refund the postage and handling fee and I had to pay to ship it back to them. It cost me quite a bit for a useless item."
1,not so comfy!,"As comfortable as they look, they aren't. I'm somewhat flat footed (not totally), and they provided no support. I originally got them for the gym, and after my workouts my legs would hurt a lot. I didn't realize shoes can do that much damage! I decided to try them at work, so I don't waste my 80 bucks, and they didn't fare well there either. They're just all wrong for the legs. It may be my feet, but normally Reeboks have been good to me. These were a huge dissapointment, and a huge waste of my money."
1,trashy and vulgar,"not sensual at all, vulgar and trashy. I was looking for slow sensual music for massage or background for love making, but this is rather distracting, imaturely provocative and most embarrassing. Not my type of music (if you call it music at all)"
4,a few misprints...,"...in the ""hard"" clues for puzzle 49 (one of the jumbo Millennium puzzles) makes it frustrating, plus one of the regular puzzles is just plain daft. Otherwise up to usual high standards!"
2,HUGE!,"Works great for tracing. The only difficult part is, you need a large desk and every where you tap on the display will only show up in that area on your monitor. You need to have the matching size monitor for this item to work correctly."
3,Trompe l'oeil and Faux at it's finest !,This book provieds beautiful pictures of some of the finest faux and trompe l'oeil finishes I have ever seen. However this book is NOT a step-by-step guide for the do it your selfer. I would however highly recommend this book to any Decorative artist looking for new ideas.
5,This is an amazing story!,This is an amazing book and it has seriously made me realize how lucky I am everyday and we don't even realize it.It is wonderful and it touches you in a way that lifts your spirits. I had received so much just in the first several chapters. I would advise anyone and everyone to read this book. Sasha
4,Billy Drago is the,"This is one of my favorite,Billy Drago is playing the role like a masterpiece!A Exellent thriller,lovely mysterious background music and it has everything a good thriller should have!You gonna`love it !!!"
3,dvd,"this didn't keep my g-sons interest very long at all. I think its a cute movie, but I bought it for him"
5,Great for many ages,"My son is 2 1/2 and was a big fan of the Baby Einstein series. He is now a big fan of the Little Einsteins as well. My son helps Rocket take off by patting and then raising his hands saying blast off. He even learned how to buckle his own car seat belt and then says ""Buckle seatbelts"" just like the Little Einsteins. The way it entertains and teaches it is good for toddlers to preschoolers. It is said that music and art are important to the learnind process and maybe a movie/show like this can help our children have an early influence of these subjects. Encore - please give us more Disney. Can't wait for more DVD's."
5,Little Einsteins is Excellent!,"I received a preview CD with another CD that I purchased. My son (2 1/2) loved the Baby Einstein videos when he was an infant and loves music as a result. He patted, clapped and put his hands in the air along with the Little Einstein kids. It teaches about musical instruments, concepts, rhythm and beats and various places in the world (New York, Paris, etc.). I am so glad that Disney created an extension to the Baby Einstein series."
5,"We're going on a trip in our favorite rocket ship, zooming through the skies...","Ok, I know the words to all the songs, I'll admit it. My 1 yr old loves this movie!!! I work from home so I need something to occupy him for a little while. He ""sings"" along with it and even yells ""blast-off"" when Rocket takes off. (well ok, he yells bla bla, but he's only one) It's a fun movie and a life saver. They have to help the caterpillar turn into a butterfly and then they have to help him migrate to Mexico. Now whenever he sees a butterfly he ""sings"" the butterfly song. great movie!"
4,Educational musical fun,"This fun DVD/video encourages young children to participate in problem-solving while introducing them to classical art and music. My young children play ""Little Einsteins"" even while outside, using musical terms like ""adagio"" and ""allegro"". Also, they ASK to listen to classical music. The Little Einsteins movie and shows are educational musical fun."
5,Exciting!,"It takes a child on an exciting musical adventure in the real world, riding their musical Rocket. The children, Leo, June, Quincy, & Annie complete a mission while learning. It's interactive & will have your child singing, clapping, dancing, clapping, patting. It has both live action scenery with animated characters, & shows famous artworks & classical music."
1,NOT IF YOU HAVE A SEASON PASS!!,If you get the iTunes season 1 pass DO NOT buy this video!!! I was VERY disappointed to find out that this video is basically the last two of the tv serves in a seamless succession (A Brand New Outfit and The Missing Invitation) Again please don't waste your money if you get the season pass!!
3,Not The Best But Not The Worst Kids DVD,My son saw the ads for The Little Einsteins dvd when it first came out and he had to have it. Well I found it terrible and he only watched it a few times. It is a bit educational which is always a good thing but I would not recommend this dvd unless your child is really into Little Einsteins.
5,Baby Einstein Grows Up!,Just bought this DVD for my son and he loved it. He was just as mesmerized by this as he was the Baby Einstein series. I hope to see more of this new series for him as he grows.
1,Needs negative stars,ugh this is so bad that it doesn't get even a single star the little einsteins just ruined my life we need to boycott this vhs tape the animation was awful and the voices were very squeaky i've rented this twice in 2007 and it was not good no good at all try veggietales rolie polie olie dale earnhardt inc adventures little bug or the super mario bros super show they are all the better shows shame on the baby einstein company
1,Very disappointed customer,DVD won't play!!!! Froze on menu screen... I've tried it on all of my DVD players and the same thing happens! :( very disappointed with my purchase and so were my classroom of preschoolers!!!
2,Good product but not worth the cost - FRAUD,Pros:- Very informative- Cool graphics- Educational and non-violent- Suitable for kids of all agesCons:- They are charging $15+ bucks for something that is available for FREE on cable and Dish- It was not specified that the DVD contains OLD episodes- Total diappointment for my son as he had seen these episodes on TV already (and still exist on our DVR)- I won't trust Disney's prices anymore. They are ripping off consumers.
3,Better stick with the infants who are easier to please.,"I had a sneak peek at this one for my two boys who loved Baby Einstein as babies. However, this cheaply animated cartoon wasn't enough to hold their attention for long. Just turn on PBS Kids or the Discovery Channel and save yourselves some money."
2,big adventure?,i thought it was like a movie little film but this big adventure was actually the series he had been watching on tv. so for that price it was a worst of money. many thanks
3,Watch out for the Bats,"My daughter has always been a big fan of Baby Einstein. We were excited to see Little Einsteins come out as we knew our daughter was outgrowing the Baby Einstein videos as she is now 2 1/2. The first time she watched Little Einsteins, she really enjoyed it. I was suprised to see how they had the kids react to the bats. I knew the first time I saw the kids running from the bats, my daughter would reach to it. The second time she watched the video, she covered her eyes when the kids entered the cave. For each viewing after this she began to become afraid of the bats. Now, after having only watch this video six times, she refused to watch it. She has watched other Little Einsteins on tv and loves them to the point she asks for them. I look forward to more episodes coming out. Just a warning to parents of younger kids, they may become scared by the video."
5,disney's little einsteins,Excellent film. My [...] year old loves it he enjoys the interaction with the characters and is learning some great words.Throughly recommend it to all kids under 6.We can't wait for the launch of the next film.
5,My 2 year old loves Little Einsteins,"My son will be 2 in a week and absolutely loves this movie! It keeps him engaged through the entire movie (helps me to get a few things done.) He knows the characters names, pats with them to rev up Rocket and says ""Blast Off!"" He asks for the ""caterpillar movie"" by name. The music is lovely, the characters and cute and friendly and the colors are great. The scenery is amazing, from the wheat fields to the musical tree of many colors, and I especially love the finale at the butterfly gathering in Mexico. Great movie, highly recommended and I will buy more of this series."
5,The only book out there that will REALLY get you published!,"I not only loved this book, but I used it to sell my first article. Gage and Coppess have written the only book out there that tells you how magazine publishing really works. Forget *Writer's Digest* and other unprofessional misinformation. Read *Get Published* and find out what you *must* know before approaching editors with your ideas.PS: I took Marcia Coppess's seminar in Washington, DC, and found it priceless as well."
2,Review for Metra PKRD3 4GA Amp Install Kit,"Well, this kit was fine, except for one thing: One, it says ""25ft. of 16ga. Speaker Wire,"" and it only came with about 8ft. So, I'm going to have to go out and buy more stuff, even though I already bought this kit!Otherwise, it's fine."
1,Would not recommend this cart!,"Shipped without the bolts to put it together. Finally got them and then went to get air in tires and found one tire/tube to be defective. Called again and got a new wheel/tire/tube. Back to put it together again and found that I had two right sides and no left side. Then the hinges didn't line up, so the bolts wouldn't fit in right. Called again and demanded that they take the darned thing back. A week and a half later, I finally got the paperwork to send the thing back, now I'm playing the waiting game to get my money credited back on my credit card. I'm not a happy camper!"
3,so bad it's almost good...,"""A few years ago, I wrote a screenplay for a film called _Moving_, which, inexplicably, got made...""That was how the author of this film described it in an article I once read, and it's pretty much all you need to know about it (he went on to tell how the director, as a joke, snuck his home phone number in on a sign shown in the background, resulting in hunderds of harassing phone calls when it came out on video).Still, much like that old Star Trek theory about how if you go far enough to one side of the universe you pop out on the other side, there _is_ an art to stupidity. So, if you have a taste for such things (and a cold six-pack handy), this might just be your afternoon of chuckles."
3,I love this movie! Good Movie! But I'm upset!,"Richard Pryor did a great job in this movie! It was so funny and he sing like on Wizrd of oz ""there was no place like home"" He did a great job and I watch it over and over! I'm upset cuz they didn't make on DVD! I want them to make it on DVD's!I gave them 3 star cuz they didn't make on DVD's! Please make it cuz I am Richard Pryor Fans! This is a good movie for making on DVD's."
1,Nothing More Than A Lame Attempt At Comedy,Moving is one sad misrable comedy that fails at every turn.Richard Pryor who in the past has been able to deliver greatcomedy with rogue humor but is made to be a complete fool here aBill Cosby Type as a Engineer who gets fired from his job andmust plead with his family to make a fresh start in Idaho.Laughter is the furthest thing from anyone's mind. This filmwon't go down as one of Pryor's Classics.
1,I will rate this movie higher when its finally put on DVD,"Why hasnt this great comedy been put onto DVD yet? Did the people converting movies from the reels pack up and leave, and this was one of the films that they said ""where taking it with us""?Come on, this a 4 to 5 star comedy , when is coming out on DVD? Treat great comedys with respect. And this is certinly one of Richard Pryors best.... TO DVD, NOW"
4,Good 80's Comedy,Richard Pryor and Randy Quaid play against each other perfectly in this movie. This movie may not be a great but definetely is entertaining and funny. Give it a look.
4,Funny!,This movie was pretty silly but it was funny and enjoyable and Richard Pryor was very good as the father of a family who have to move to another state and the scenes with him and and his wife their bratty teenage daughter who doesn't want to move and trys to wreck their chances of selling the house and the wacky things she did and what they did to prevent her from doing any more damage were very funny!
3,The Swear Jar Scene Is Funny!,"Moving is a funny movie. Some scenes are hilarious, including the scene with the father, the daughter and the swear jar."
4,WHY ISN'T THIS ON DVD?,"There are so many great movies that have NOT been released to DVD and it boggles my mind. This movie, Moving, is hilarious. I remember laughing all the way through it and hope it comes to DVD soon."
4,Great for families with food allergies,"My son is serevely allergic to nuts and eggs with a strong sensitivity to milk and this cookbook has helped so much! The book has great ideas for every meal breakfast, lunch, dinner and even snacks. I really like that in the back of the book it has examples of Menus that you could do from the cookbook. Thank you. What a life saver. We can all eat pancakes again!"
1,Recipes are tasteless or don't work,"Was very dissapointed with this book. Recipes are mostly for adults, not my 5 yr. old ds with allergies. I have tried many recipes and they either are not tasty or just plain don't work. The only one that was half way decent was the sugar cookie. Don't waste your money on this, and especially don't buy them both!!"
1,Pointless buy for someone that can cook,"My son was diagnosed with a severe milk allergy last year and I was heartbroken all the things he would miss out on. This book would be ok for someone just diagnosed and has no clue about cooking. If your a good cook and your aware of daiya cheese, life is good foods, U parve, and and go dairy .com don't waste your money. I was so excited about getting these then I read through them they are basic recipes and my three year would not touch with a 10 ft pole. A waste of thirty dollars I bought both books."
3,"Not a Wheat Free/gluten free book, but good","My son is allergic to all Beans also (Legumes) and Beef so this book only had a few recipes I can use. The Wheat can be replaced with Bette Hagram's Featherlite recipe 1:1 if you can tolerate rice, corn, tapioca starch and potato flour. I'm a tough critic to please since my son's allergies include Dairy, Beef, Soy, Wheat, Peanuts, Treenuts, Gluten Grains, Legumes, Shellfish, Food Dyes, Curry spice, and Cumin."
3,It is okay,"I was alittle disappointed in this book. What disappointed me, was that in many of the recipes they ask for dairy-free butter. My son cannot eat dairy-free butter because he is allergic to milk and egg protein. Alot of the dairy-free items have milk protein in them. I am unable to use all the recipes in this book, but the recipes I can use are very good and my son loves them. If you are looking for a milk and egg free cookbook that does not use dairy-free items then this one is not for you."
2,Outdated recipes,I purchased this book a few years ago because my daughter has food allergies. The recipes are outdated and some are just not worth trying. I've been able to find better ones on the internet for free. Sorry.
1,Diappointing again...,"I just had to write a review after getting this book. The only reason I would give it 1 star cause it looks like it has some pretty good recipes in it. This book just like all the others I have read to cook my my allergic child, states the obvious. For example it will say use dairy free chocolate chips, dairy free margarine. The only substitute it changes is the eggs. I was disappointed because I already know these things and could cook just fine. I was hoping by the other reviews that this book really did give me other options. I was wrong!"
2,"Okay, but basic and obvious","This is an okay cookbook, but it is very basic. I think most us can figure out how to make meatloaf without eggs or milk. If you know how to subsitute rice milk and egg replacer, then this is the same as any regular meat and potatoes cookbook. If you are looking for interesting recipes and a high quality cookbook from someone who really knows her way around the kitchen, try ""The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook"" by Cybele Pascal. It is the absolute best allergy cookbook I've used, and one of the best general cookbooks on the shelf. I've tried plenty of other allergy cookbooks and they are typically quite disappointing."
2,Not a great book for a child with mutilple food allergies,"My son is allergic to Milk, Soy and Corn and this book is just okay in coming up with ideas for your child if they are allergic to one of these foods. The reciies are just okay and not the best in the world. I found I did better on my own just experimenting with my Bettie Crocker cookbook.Probably wouldn't recommend it."
5,Great Buy!,I have an allergy to eggs so this book is a life saver. I have done quite a few of the receipes and they came out great. The cakes are yummy.So if you have any of the above allergies then this book is worth your time and money.
4,Life Saver,"I recently was told that my son has nut, milk and egg allergy. I didn't even know where to begin with what I could cook for him or what foods he will be able to enjoy. So far I have tried the pancakes and cakes, he loved. Thanks to this book I have a new found love for cooking."
5,Thank goodness for this book,"This is my new favorite cook book. I'm new to the egg free, dairy free world and this book is wonderful. I've tried a variety of recipes and love them all ... chicken, beef, zucchini bread, apricot jam muffins. My boyfriend and a few choice friends at work are my new guinea pigs and they love everything I've made so far. I would absolutely tell everyone with egg/dairy issues to get this book. It has made a difficult situation much easier to deal with. The recipes are very easy and we all probably have most of the ingredients in our basic kitchens."
5,Incredible cookbook using ordinary ingredients,"Everything I have tried in this book has turned out wonderful. I have several other dairy-free, egg-free cookbooks and they all call for exotic ingredients or Egg Replacer product which makes all my baked goods have a strange salty taste. With this cookbook, I have made delicious cakes, brownies, muffins and cookies completely dairy and egg free. I am sending my recipes to my friends to use for my kids. Thanks so much Linda Coss. I'll be the first to buy your next cookbook!"
2,Pretty but not edible!,I recently sent this Get Well fortune cookie to my Godfather. I had asked his wife ahead of time for an honest critique after they received it. She proceeded to tell me that it was packaged beautifully and arrived safe and sound to their door. The chocolate had melted to the cellophane and the cookie did not taste good at all. They won't be eating it. It's an expensive way to just give a message. I would have been better off sending a giant Mrs. Field's cookie or a box of Godiva chocolates. I was very disappointed. I hate when I take a chance on something as a gift and the recipient is disappointed. It's a fine way to send a message but not so fine if you plan on wanting to eat it.
5,Don't Sleep on this Album,"This album is dope from the first track to the last. Dilated Peoples have that REAL hip hop sound since they started. The Platform, Expansion Team and now Neighborhood Watch are money well spent. Dilated Peoples are for true hip hop heads and you will not be disappointed."
5,"Skate2live92------ this is definitely the BEST CD, BUY IT!!!","OK, this cd gets 5 stars, some of the best work from DP ive heard, expansion team was also really ill, but this has some tracks that top it. All the songs on this are dope, i think that expansion team has some songs as good as the ones on this CD, but i like this a lot more.OK, my advice------ get away from your computer, go to towerrecords and BUY IT (u could get it right away instead of orderin onl.ine and WAITING, or u could do what i did, buy the cd on iTunes for 14 bucks)SO stop reading and BUY IT!!!!"
5,Neighborhood Watch is one of my all time favs.,"Dilated peoples is a stylish, funky hip- hop group composed of Rakaa (rapper), Evidence ( rapper) an Babu (DJ). Big Business, Marathon and This Way are probably the hottest tracks, but Kanye West's part on This Way is wasted. This L.A. group is inspiring and hella tite, and I can't wait to cop their two previous CDs. This is a true hip hop group with something real and important to say whether it's about current events politically, or whether it is about getting up and changing your lifestyle for tommorrow. This rap group (to its advantage), does not curse just for the ****ing sake of doing it. They are mindful and their symbolism, and interesting, almost spiritual methods of real underdog hip- hop gansta **** are both moving and thought- provoking. Babu's beats are off da chain! If you don't like 'em, than you can bend down and kiss my shoes. Also, war is destructive and wrong."
2,Dissapointment,"All I can say is that I'm thankful that I burned this CD before buying it. ""This Way"" featuring Kanye West has been one of my favorite tracks this year, but like a lot of LP's with nice singles (Pitch Black, Method Man) it failed to satisfy my ears. Production is not as good as thier previous albums, maybe if Kanye did more tracks it would have been better. The only track that I like on this album besides ""This Way"" is ""Poisinous"" which has good verses and a ill beat. ""Reach Us"" has ill verses and an aight beat. DJ Babu in the last track is pretty hot.Overall, this has no replay value except ""This Way"", ""Poisenous"", and ""DJ Babu"". Unfortunally, this is another wack album with a top quality single.Lyrics: 3/5Production: 2/5Originality: 1/5 (They are so predictable)"
2,peoples need to improve,I dont know if this was just me but i really wasnt feeling this album. theres only a few good tracks that i listen to.ill give it a 2 because 'dj babu in deep concentration' and 'this way' are tight tunes!
4,Simply put.....not as good as past albums but still good,"Dialated People's quality overall has dropped a bit, mainly cause of Evidence's flow, and certain production on some songs. But it is still a very good album. Irascience is still a mad lyrical genius, but overall on this album you can tell they branched out they're style a bit to appeal to more mainstream listeners. They're not exactly trying to sell out, although it looked like it with Kanye West on a track. Even so, the song with Kanye West is one of the best on the album, same with Love and War, Marathon, and Posionous. Even so, they are still a fresh group with a much better message than most mainstream rappers, which gives them the same approach towards their carrers as Kanye West and the Roots.In otherwords, a good album, not their best, but Dialated will still be around for a while."
4,A Must-Have for any Hip Hop Enthusiast!,"In my opinion, Dilated Peoples are the best hip-hop group to ever come out of L.A. I know that's a strong statement, but the combinations of lyrics by Evidence and Rakaa over Babu's beats are simply amazing. Most of their stuff is produced by the Alchemist and it always comes out tight! I can't stand rap that talks about bitches and guns all the time. You've got to have a message and showcase your intelligence to get my vote, and that's exactly what Dilated Peoples does. Neighborhood Watch is an amazing album that I highly recommend!"
3,"Solid, but there is something missing...","When I finally finished listening the whole way through Neighborhood Watch, I felt a little disappointed. They come hard on every track, and the production is sharp (though for the most part not outstanding). The main problem is, no songs live up to the hit single ""This Way."" And I don't even normally like Kanye... Anyway, while solid on the mic, Dilated Peoples deliver a little less than expected. For fans of the group (I am admittedly pretty unfamiliar with their material), I would guess that this CD would be enjoyable. Otherwise, it's a toss-up."
5,TRYIN' TO BREATHE,"DILATED IS BACK WITH AVENGEANCE, NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH IS A TRUE L.A. HIP-HOP ALBUM CHECK OUT NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH/1580 SKIT/ & WORLD ON WHEELS. THE WHOLE ALBUM IS STR8 FIRE FROM MARATHON TO DJ BABU IN DEEP CONCENTRATION. GO GET IT!!!!!!!"
1,zero replay value. not worth the 79 cents i paid at allofmp3,"the album is just lame, and i wouldnt listen to it again. if you like commerical rap with an intellectual twist, check out kanye west."
2,price,i paid $33.00 for the book.upon receipt on the back cover embossed pricing was $24.95.i also found on line the same book for $20.00.
2,Misleading Photo...,"This cookie arrived in a cute white box, but when I opened it... i was disappointed. It honestly looked nothing like the photo, and worse, it tasted so bad no one wanted to eat it."
5,I will always be a man who's open to Persuasion,"It's Richard live and it's superb, of course. His performance of ""Persuasion"" which he co-wrote with Tim Finn (music by Richard, words by Tim) would be worth the price of admission on its own."
4,Good Book ~ For All!,"Mental Entree, was an intriguing and motivating book. This book helps you think about problems from a different prospective and helps you overcome fears and weaknesses. A very good book overall. Sarah, Florida"
4,Great,"Very useful and with the small price, as you absolutely NEED a map to venture into this crazy city...although you will need additional material, such as a subway map and perhaps a more detailed tour guide."
3,Not that useful,"I bought this map before a trip to Tokyo but when I got there I realized that there's not much use for it. I did look at it couple of times when in Tokyo but I couldn't find the location I needed.The map itself is well made but you can get a nice map (in English) for free in Tokyo subway, hotels, and many tourist locations. If I did have use for it, I'd want this map to be smaller, one horizontal fold would help."
5,Don't try Tokyo without it,"We travel a great deal and have to admit- Tokyo is amazing, unforgetable and daunting to find your way around without this map. Often we're just fine with whatever you can get at the local I. Not so with Tokyo, save yourself a lot of frustration in being disoriented- this is a huge city tightly compacted and not to be missed. We were there 5 days and this map was priceless- we rarely buy maps but this one made a Huge difference for us."
2,Street wise tokyo,"This map is not helpful as it excludes relevant portions of the city. Portion relevant as Tokyo is not a centralized city as many others, but lives on various epicentres as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Ueno, Asaksa etc. which have thir own suburbs bustling with life and activites of every day relevance.If you're only interested in the main area of the city then this map is otherwise excellent.Tommaso"
4,Great for a gag gift.,This was great for a gag gift. I cannot comment on its true purpose in life but it was certainly a worthy purchase.
4,Larry King is right!,"Larry King is right. This is a great book which really opens your mind on the behavior of people in business situations and in personal life. At times, the writing lost my attention but overall, I recommend this book for everyone to read.Dealing with your kids, people at work, the boardroom, customers, neighbors, etc... this book opens your eyes and ears to a new way of thinking.Great book Robert!"
1,Utter Fluff,"Having previewed the back cover, and seeing the rave reviews from Cuba Gooding Jr. and Entertainment Today, for a book on arguing, I should have known better.As an MBA student from the Wharton School, I figured it would be good to brush up on some soft skills, but I found this book difficult to follow, and the advice impractical and irrelevant. As you read this book, paragraph by paragraph, there is absolutely no flow or coherence to the points the author is trying to make. Each paragraph is a mini-rant in and of itself; like a random stream of consciousness that has no connection to the paragraph before it, or the paragraph after it. I was frustrated reading through this book, but since I dropped 12 bucks on it, I figured there woudl be some A-HA moment, a treasured insight, that would redeem this mess of a book. I didn't find it unfortunately, and I'd recommend that you not waste your time reading this book; it's several hours of my life I'll never get back."
2,Great title shame about the content,"I found this book infuriating to read and ultimately a fruitless effort. I was really attracted to the title and after reading the table of contents was looking forward to reading the book. To my increasing disappointment it just turned to be full of anecdotes and platitudes. Though each chapter always started out with a nice descriptive framework, it inevitably, rapidly descended into slighly disconnectd and distractive anecdotes. Halfway through the book I finally gave up, which is incredibly rare for me as I almost always finish a book no matter how bad."
1,How to make a fast buck,This book is just a listing of famous people and how the author knows them.It would have been fine as an autobiography - but not as a book under the title given. The chapter titles don't make any sense at all and the stories have no connection to them anyway. I don't think it sensible to take advice on argument from someone who can't even maintain a basic logical premise in a paragraph.
1,Don't bother,This books has useless information. I was hoping for an outlined way to win arguements or a step by step plan. This book had no such information. The title is deceiving. Don't waste your time.
3,works well but poorly built,"First the good....this rod keeps my edges like razors.The bad....I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of the materials used in construction....everything from the plastic used in the handle to the grit itself. The entire piece just feels flimsy in your hand and i feel like if it slipped away from me and hit a hard floor it might break. The abrasive surface does an excellent job on my blades but for what little I use this piece, I already feel like it is wearing out and don't expect this tool to last long. And no...I don't abuse it when I use it.I don't want to be too negative. This rod does do a good job, there just might be better out there. It looks a little out of place in a block of high quality blades and will probably wear out sooner than you wish."
4,Poets behind Barbed Wire,"It is a good set of translations of traditional Japanese poetry written by prisoners of American internment camps during WWII, many American citizens, of Japanese descent."
1,Not worthy of National Geographic name,"Unsteady. Wobbly. Cheap. Cheesy. Fully extended, the legs are like rubber bands. Nikon D2H body and short lens all but cause legs to buckle. Many other compact tripods out there that are not as poorly made. Don't put your good gear in danger."
1,Pretty Poor Excuse for a Tripod,"Good news is that it is small and lightweight. I bought it because it collapsed to a short length and it was pretty lightweight.Bad news is that it is a piece of junk. I have used the tripod ""lightly"" over the past couple of years and many if not all of the latches have cracked or broken. It is totally non-functional.I thought with the National Geographic name it would have been a much better ""travel"" tripod.Don't waste your money."
4,The Late Byzantine Army by Mark C. Bartusis,"Mark C. Bartusis' book is a tightly written and well organized scholarly exploration of the Byzantine army in the final two-and-a-half centuries of the empire. Divided into two sections, the first part of the work is an overview of the army's role in the political organization of the empire. The section concludes with a very well-written short essay on the fall of Constantinople. The second section is a technical discussion of the organization and financing of the army. Coming to the book as a general reader with an interest in Byzantine history, I found the glossary of court and military terms very helpful. The bibliography provides a wealth of possibilities for future reading. Bartusis' writing is scholarly but it is not stilted and overly-formal as is the work of many scholar-historians. ""The Late Byzantine Army"" provides the general reader and the reader of military history with a brief but well-drawn and understandable portrait of the subject."
5,Excellent Preparation for Travel in Brazil,"Last October, I ordered Peter Robb's ""A Death in Brazil: A Book of Omissions,"" paying for hardcover on the strength of its reviews. It was worth the price. And well worth the weight. I hauled it around in my rucksack for during a four-week trip in the state of Bahia. Being a story hog, I generally read fiction written by local authors when I travel. But this nonfiction kept me fascinated throughout. As a visitor with little information about Brazil, I found the book gave me a tremendous headstart on the culture, the political history, the food, the population and TV. With many quirky details.Robb's mix of political history, personal travelogue, and ideology sustained me throughout. After I gobbled up the book, my husband read it. A fellow traveler borrowed it and read it in two days. Then a Brazilian friend insisted I leave it for her and now I'm ordering the book in paperback to take with me this winter when I return to Bahia."
2,definitely omitted a lot,"The subtitle of this book is ""A Book of Omissions"" and there is definitely something missing. There're heaping tablespoons of information on Brazil's political history and how that emerged from her unique colonial history. The problem is twofold--the writer intertwines some irrelevant and mostly boring episodes in his life into it (just skip all that if you actually pick up this book...trust me) and I found the Chronology at the back made far more sense than the body of this work.Maybe it just needed a better writer or editor. I can't put a finger on it.It's sad really as this subject is a goldmine.So two stars for the fascinating history of Brazilian politics and no stars for the writing which did not blow me away at all."
5,"thoroughly enjoyable, fascinating mix-it-up","i have been to brazil and enjoyed it immensely, my favorite part of the country being salvador, bahia. i picked up this book with some interest, and was gratified that it provided so much more than a fluffy novel. the author moves from sugar plantations to conversations with a bar owner to military rule to endemic corruption to street kids to issues of race - within 5 or 6 pages. and none of it feels forced, he provides insightful details that explain so much to people accustomed to western cultures - or even other latin american cultures to those who have traveled outside the u.s.part history, part novel, part memoir, the book is worth a read to anyone with an interest in brazil. it will entertain while you learn - i wish history had been this intriguing when i took it in school."
2,Too Superficial,"This book is very strange. It is neither an academic essay nor a good analisys of Brazilian history and costumes.It is a combination of everything that ends up being very dissapointing.For a brief book on Brazilian history, I reccomend ""Brazil: Five Centuries of Change"" by Thomas Skidmore. It is an excellent first step on the subject."
2,All Over the Place,"It started out promising - the perils of present day Rio- but then it turns into a very messy history book. It's full of interesting facts and it inspires a great reading list, but it was a real chore to finish. A rambling romp through Brazil's sexy and horrible history."
2,An interesting read,"An interesting enough book, with great descriptions of the cuisine and the people. A bit too leftist for my tastes, but as long as you take the politics with a hefty pinch of salt or better still ignore it entirely, it's quite harmless.The most irritating thing, however, is the overuse of italics. About half way through the book, that's going to really start getting on your nerves."
4,Not too Shabby,the book offers a lot of cpntemporary phrases and does a good job serving more experienced people in conjugations and offerd solutions.. Nice overall
3,"Tiger Woman aka ""The Perils of Darkest Jungle""",I was pleased with the visual print but the dialogue went a bit quiet twice for just a moment and if this is the type of serial you like then buy it. Allan Lane is brilliant as always. but the alternative title is misleading it is hardly in the darkest jungle.
3,American Fashion History,"This book was helpful in learning about the fasion industry. It has a humorous overlay to the whole thing, which kept me intersted. It's an important part of the American fashion industry.st_debrosse"
1,Not as advertised,This is a PROMO CD not the real thing. Inside it says to contact an 800 number to order the actual CD. I asked the seller for a refund but I never got the refund either. Don't waste your time on this.
2,it's hard as a rock,"I read the good reviews and went to the store looking for it. Only to find out it was a big DISAPPOINTMENT. The seat is so hard you can actually ""knock"" on it. the sides of the head are short and a sleeping child will have trouble with head support.I bought the Britax Parkway instead, and it was absolutely worth the extra 30 bucks. The seat has so much cushion and the head wont fall when my son is asleep. I would check it out before buying this."
5,Love this Booster for my SON!!,I love this booster for my oldest son. We got it when he was 3 1/2. My mother-in-law actually bought this for her to keep for when she takes my son with her. I put it together for her and installed it in her SUV and Loved how it fit in the car and how my son fit in it so much. I went out and bought one while he was with her that afternoon. We hated the booster we had ..as it was so tall it was hard to get the seat belt strapped on.I just bought another one of these for him today for our suburban we just got.We own 3 of these including my mother-in-laws and we also have one of these with just the base for my husbands work truck!I can't wait to get 2 (1 for each car)of these for my 2 year old but he doesn't meet the age recommendation yet. He meets the minnumin height and weight requirment but I prefer to use the harness until he reaches 40lbs.I have recommend this seat to everyone!
3,Didn't seem very comfortable.,"I bought this seat for my 3 year old son. It was a transition from a convertible car seat. My first impression when I brought it out of the box was that it didn't have much padding. The first 3 times I put my son into it, he started to wimper. Not sure if that was because it was different, or if he didn't feel as secure (boosters are different from car seats in that the child doesn't get the sense of being set into the seat, but on it). Anyway, we used it for a week and a half until I received a Combi Yorktown booster seat I bought off of ebay. That one has much more padding, and also has more ""sides"". No complaining when I put him into that one. I guess I can't say anything too negative about the Graco, it just wasn't a good fit for either my son or I."
3,Good seat but needs some improvement,"I bought this seat for my 6yr old son. I had intended on buying the Britax Parkway Express but my son liked this one better. We had a Britax Super Elite and he complained all the time about how uncomfortable it was on his bottom so the extra padding in this seat is a MAJOR +. However I hate that the back comes apart from the bottom booster so easy. If you try to move this seat with one hand it will fall apart on you. Also the arm rest leave little to be desired. It is very difficult to put the seat belt under the armrests(at least with an older child). If they would make them raise and lower it would be much better.I bought the Evenflo Big Kids Everest booster for my daughter and we like it much better! It is $20 cheaper, the arm rests raise and lower to put the seatbelt on, it stays together unless you take it apart, plus it has lights in the headrest for nighttime traveling."
3,Not best for a CNC machine,"I purchased this router to use as part of a DIY CNC mill. It works as specified. Three observations:The collet is not very precise. This is not a big problem for normal use, but for use in a CNC mill it is a problem.It can be difficult to remove a ""mill"" (i.e., a router bit.) after installing a bit, removal is difficult. The instructions say to ""gently tap"" the collet nut when this happens. Cleaning the shaft of each new mill/bit with a solvent (acetone) helps, but the need to use serious force and impact to remove a bit is disconcerting.The collet accepts a 1/4"" shaft. DeWalt does not offer a collet that accepts a 1/8"" shaft, and there are no 3rd-party collets. This severely restricts the range of mills/bits you can use. (This is more of an issue when using in a CNC machine than when using as a trim router.)For all these reasons, I purchased a different router to replace the DeWalt."
2,Not even remotely permanent,I decided to ignore the rest of these reviews saying the color doesn't last long and bought the product anyway. I should have listened. I applied the color and the results were gorgeous. Three to four days later it had already faded significantly. So now I'm on the lookout for a different hair dye that will last much longer.
5,best album he ever did,"leroy hutson is one of those great artist that unless you are a real lover of soul music he gets lost in the crowd. he has written and produced hit songs for himself as well as the natural four ""can this be real"". he is also a great keyboard player and vocalist with true genious that went unoticed by most mainstream record listeners."
5,THE MAN!,"This has to be Leroy Hutson at his best! This is soul perfectly written and composed. It's a shame he didn't get enough exposure because to me he is one of soul's best kept secret. Easily all tracks are excellent, but the one that stands out is All because of you. This album is essential and don't forget to buy the follow up to this album Hutson II."
3,An aspect of western americana little known,"This is the first book to touch on the subject of southern prisoners taking an oath to the US Government to fight indians in the west. During the civil war, most military men returned east to seek their glory in the many battles. This left our western borders unprotected. Yet the tide of western migration was not stalled. Civil war prisons in the north became overcrowded. The idea of releasing POWs for service in the west was born; hence the name galvanized. This book is the story of those soldiers, who out of desperation for better living conditions agreed to a term of service to fight indians and protect the western frontier. My only complaint on this book was that it was to thin. I craved for more knowledge."
4,Interesting and unusual subject,"The Galvanized Yankees is an interesting book about US Civil War Confederate soldiers who were offered a chance to take an oath of loyalty to the Union if they would enlist in the army and serve on the western frontier. About six thousand eventually did so, serving between 1864 and 1866. Brown's narrative history mostly follows them by recalling the history of a unit or units grouped together, with a couple of chapters about individuals. Recommended for those most interested in military or American history, although the book does tend to get repetitious at times."
2,Defeatist Attitude to Life,"The story line reminded me of Thomas Hardy's classical work ""Jude the Obscure"" about a man's defeatist & self-destructive attitude to life. Chase is the Jude in this case. His sidekick is the English professor Pink Lady or Serena Ransom. An excellent family name as she holds Chase ransom to her demands. My interest was not sustained throughout the book and I felt like giving up as I knew how the story would pan out. There were no surprises or shocks along the way that would give this book the wow factor.I found the plot too draggy. Too much emphasis on the oddball characters that soon lost its fizz after you got the hang of it. The plot was thin without any twists and turns."
2,Not Theresa's best effort,"OK, we get it already, Ms. Monseur: Paris is a tormented, tough, sometimes gentle woman who can't decide which part of her anatomy to think with. This book had all the elements of a wonderful thriller; full of creepy but sympathetic characters and a sound plot. Save one thing; by the last third of the book. I got bogged down. In endless, mind-numbing detail. Every sentence stacatto. Fragmented segments. It was like she ran out of energy. Needed to fill space. I'll paraphrase: ""She opened her makeup drawer. Withdrew the shiny cylinder of lipstick. Pulled off the silver top. Swiped her bottom lip once. Swiped her top lip once. Smacked them together."" Not a direct quote, but the kind of detail that really bogged me down. Really is a pity. She wrote two excellent books. Now she seems to think she can ""phone them in."""
2,Not Recommended,"An overall disappointment. The writing and plot dragged in spots. Monsour writes in fragmented sentences that get kind of annoying after 4 or 5 in a row. The plot was simple (if not a little odd) and there were no surprises, twists, or suspenseful moments to keep the reader guessing. Also, I found one of the characters unbelievable. Serene Ransom is straight-up crazy (which you gather very early in the story), yet she has managed to maintain a high-level position at a university. She has absolutely no redeeming qualities and I find it impossible to believe that she could have functioned at all in her given position."
5,Best mouse of its kind,"I've used several optical mice over the years, and this one beats them all. The buttons are all programmable and while the software doesn't let you configure the buttons/acceleration/speed to the extent that Kensington does, the shape of the mouse is very comfortable (for righties only). If you want a symmetric mouse or more programmability try Kensington's mice."
3,"Good software, cheaply made hardware","Almost immediately upon receiving the mouse, some of the stick on screw covers and frictionless pads started to come off. After nearly two years I had a critical breakdown of the connecting cable to the mouse which rendered it useless. I have used many mice on many PCs, some during the concurrent time period as this one, some for a lot longer and this includes the cheapest of mice and have never had this kind of breakdown in any of them. The way they set up the optics also causes it to gather dust and require frequent cleaning. I also felt the mouse sits up slightly to high but that will vary by user.The good is the software and the ease of configuration. This would have been a great mouse had the hardware been manufactured better. If you can get it for around $20 I would recommend it but cannot recommend it for more than that. There are many mice that cost as much and in some cases less than the MX 510 that are a lot better."
2,Nice Ergo ... but absolutely not durable for gaming!,"I might as well direct you to the reviewer below regarding durability ... I, too, traded out four times before leaving Logitech and moving on to another brand. Microswitch buttons (left and right) will fail after a couple months of gaming use. The ergonomics are outstanding, but a gamer needs durability too!"
5,Nice Mice,"This mouse is one of the best I've used in terms of comfortability and sensitivity. I didn't install the drivers on the CD (I really don't like having another driver eat up RAM), but the mouse worked flawlessly upon plugging it in a Windows XP box.The only problem I see is the slightly uneven mouse feet at the bottom."
2,Bad quality.,"I got to use this mouse for about 2 weeks before it completely died.I didn't abuse it or anything, just standard use.. (maybe 10 hours total use)It worked great before it died, and I really wish it would've continued working that well.The only reason it got 2 instead of 1 star is because it was great while it lasted."
2,No durability,"I own both the mx518 and the mx1000. While I otherwise like the design and performance, on every single mouse on both models, the left click button will fail, either gradually or suddenly. I game heavily so I really work that button. I have swapped out several times on both models with the same result. Within 60 to 90 days, the left click button will fail. Be forewarned about this aspect."
3,short-lived,"Fine while it lasted; after about 6 months, it was erratic, the light not staying on - or sometimes it would, no rhyme nor reason."
5,Nice mouse,"This mouse has everything you could want, some of the things that make it different from others ive used, it is very stable in game IE. if your aimin at head level itll stay at head level and not be kinda wobbly as my other mice have, if you play games such as counter-strike or BF2 you know how much headshots can make a difference, the dark blue/black looks good together and you cant see the red optical light at all when mouse is on your mousepad, i would recommend getting a fairly large mousepad though as this mouse is larger than what ive used but still lighter it has given me a few problems on my small mousepad, if your thinkin about getting a different mouse don't, once you get use to the feel of this mouse you'll love it."
4,"Perfect for your guy's ""reading room""","This is a great book for us hockey fans. The stories are short and interesting. Notable players from the history of hockey as well as current players are featured. Let's face it, we want to know everything about our favorite players, some of these stories are surprising."
3,Damage,"Unfortunately, there's a glue-like substance diagonally across the top 1/3rd of the book. I'll see if I can remove it."
5,Great Suspense,"As an avid reader of mystery and suspense, I am extremely pleased when I find a new author who can tell a great story. In Obsession Wanda Dyson continues the story of her two main characters, JJ and Zoe. Sparks fly between these two whenever they get together-JJ wants to protect Zoe and Zoe wants to be free to work independently. Dyson does a great job of weaving in the Christian elements and message by using her characters' struggles and doubts. And the suspense is great-Dyson masterfully weaves in her red herrings, keeping the reader wondering who the true villain is until the very end. I had trouble putting this book down until I was through."
5,The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Review,"I have been looking for this players guide for a number of years now, and I finally found it! I highly recommend this players guide to anyone who has either been a reader of Nintendo Power Magazine or is a fan of The Legend of Zelda games. Even if you don't own the game itself, pick this guide up while there are some still available. Beautiful artwork describing the story of Link and his quest to save Princess Zelda and the Land of Hyrule. This is a great game and a very well put together players guide. It features a fold-out overview map of both The Light World & The Dark World. 5 stars across the board for this players guide!!!!"
4,Excellent biography,"This is a much better biography of Jennie than the 2-volume biography by Ralph Martin. There is much less supposition than was the case with Ralph Martin's biography (in fact, there's none at all here), and as it was written by a member of the Churchill family (Ms. Leslie was Jennie's great niece) it also contains what I have to term ""insider"" information. Sometimes a family member will conceal what they know, but Ms. Leslie does not. So Jennie, with all her faults and her good points, is brought to life again, as are the times in which she lived. Ms. Leslie is a sympathetic biographer, without being too admiring; thus she strikes the right balance. Well written, and a worthy addition to a Churchill book collection."
2,Watch Out,"This is not the deluxe version, it does not have all the accessories mentioned. It should be worth about $ 40-50 dollars for this being the non deluxe version. Cheaper RAID, no firewire, no game port or serial connectors, etc. I go ""snookered on this purchase!"
1,Pweh!,"I saw this ONCE. This film sucks, period. A waste of talent and a total distortion the real events. For a closer look at the time check out Sturges HOUR OF THE GUN and Costmatos' TOMBSTONE."
2,Service good Bad movie,The VHS was delivered promptly and in good condition. The movie itself was not very good. Boring.
3,DOC,"This is a very interesting take on the Doc Holliday / Wyatt Earp / Big Nose Kate relationships. It is typically villified by reviewers. It is definitely down beat and rather coarse. It is not historically accurate, particurlarly in terms of the final shoot out at the OK Corral. However, it does hold your interest. Stacey Keach's and Faye Dunaway's acting is very good. It was filmed in the era of the revisionist westerns. If you are turned off by that, this will not appeal to you. Otherwise, I recommend Doc for casual viewing."
1,A terrible disapointment,"I looked forward to seeing this movie because I thought that Stacy Keach would make a great Doc Holliday because they were both born with a cleft palate and they do favor a bit. However,I was terribly disappointed watching this movie it was so factually inaccurate it was pathetic. They couldn't even get Doc's year of birth right. It was very obvious that the makers of this movie hated Doc and Wyatt Earp."
3,why recommend Boxes For Katje,"If you want a great book, i recommend Boxes For Katjeby: Candoce Firming. This is a great book because of theanthor's use of detals, and the writing style.First of all the descriptive language makes it more intersting.som examples of the author's use of detals is how it shows to give when someone dose not have. I also like the writing style because it shows how to treat people the way you would like to, when Rose sent candy when Katje didn'thave it. I realy love this book more anything else and im sureyou will too."
5,Spectacular Book!,"This book is one of the most informative, and one of the most fascinatingly thorough books I've read on the Appalachian ""hill people."" Gazaway brings you into their strange world, while simultaneously fostering a deep respect for the mountain people and their culture. Highly recommended."
2,Trading in Oil Futures and Options,"More than hundred-twenty dollars for 160 pages of fundamentals and introductions, published in the 80ties and just updated... This is really too much!Sexy title do not justify such expense. Book worth max 20-30 dollars."
3,"$3,999.00?","I must admit--I haven't read it. I can't afford to. Four grand is a lot to pay for a book. If I'm paying that much for a book, it better be Seth Klarman's book. Or a magic book. Or an original King James Bible signed by Jesus himself.$3,999? Really?"
4,A PRETTY HANDY BOOK.,"Having been a camper for well over 50 years now and a collector of outdoor books, I am a bit familiar with this type of book. While I certainly would not recommend an extreme wildreness trek using only this book as a guide, it is filled with a remarkable amount of useful information. No camping book is the beginning and end of all information of the subject and this is certainly no exception. I did find several helpful tips and you certainly will not be hurt in anyway by reading this one. The book is well designed, does not push L.L. Bean stuff, which I found refreshing, and is quite readable."
5,Are You Serious Bro?,"Zack Ryder is definitely the most entertaining wrestler of this era. This DVD contains quite a few good matches of his, including when Hugh Jackman got behind the Ryder Revolution, which was siiiiiiccckkkk! The only thing that sucks about this DVD is the length, are you serious bro? Oh well, it's only $7 so I guess you get what you pay for. Support the broski so he can get a full length Blu Ray/DVD one day, and yes like him on facebook, follow him on twitter, and take care, spike your hair... WWWYKI!"
4,it's very human,"it is really a very interresting book, i've read it several times, and it teaches you how to train the dog in a very smooth and soft way, i have used all the training items shown in the book , and it really worked great, but the main problem in this training procedure is that it takes a lot of time for the dog to start pointing, and in many cases you will need assistance in this book's techniques."
2,Diamond sharpener,This diamond sharpener arrived well wrapped and fast. It seemed to be a course grind and not anything I would use for a fast touch up on a fine blade. Seems ok for lawn mower blades though. Really to rough.
5,This Meat Cutter Loves It!!!,"I cut meat for our local grocery store and know the importance of having a really sharp knife. I was told about the Diamond sharpening steel by a coworker that had gotten his at ""Kiss The Cook"" he paid $30 plus for his. Being on a tight budget right now due to rising gas prices I wasn't able to go and buy the one he was telling me about so I searched amazon. I found this sharpener/steel and decided to try it. This item arrived today and immediately got out my work knives. The were super sharp in no time and it didn't take much effort on my part at all. My arms will not get as sore now that I have the ability to keep my knives sharp. This sharpener is highly recommended."
5,beautiful,"this book was exactly what i needed to help me love the feeling of being pregnate. during my second pregnancy i wasn't feeling all that hot until my hubby came home with the book. i read this book three times already, even my four year old loves the stories. i cried and laughed and cried some more...read this book if you're looking for something to cheer you up while you're feeling down! An excellent book--I promise!!!!"
5,Touching,This book has funny stories as well as touching ones. The touching ones made me cry (in a good way). It's really not that hard to make me cry thanks to pregnancy hormones anyways! Great book. Love the Chicken Soup series.
2,used condition was not as advertised,"I purchased this item for a friend as a congratulatory gift after she announced her first pregnancy. There were no *brand new* books being sold directly by Amazon, so I chose a ""used"" item listed as ""mint/new"" condition by the seller. Unfortunately, when I received the item I could definitely tell the book had been previously read, as the cover and spine areas were worn and wrinkled. As you can imagine, it was slightly embarrassing to give as a gift; unfortunately, due to time constraints I didn't have time to return or exchange it for something else. I can't speak to the content of the book, only the disappointment in appearance."
2,I'll be looking to purchase a different copy...,The quality of this book is not the greatest. They didn't even look to see if all the text of the title fit on the cover. There are several words cut off on the end. The print looks like a bad photocopying job. Some of the letters blend together and make it difficult to read. There are also some large black ink blotches on some of the pages. I would definitely not waste your money on this copy. I'm very unsatisfied in it.
2,Only Spanish subtitles,"Although the cinematic quality of this DVD was excellent, we had to return it to Amazon, as the only language offered in the subtitles menu was Spanish. This was not delineated in the product description. We need to view our DVD's with English subtitles. This is an issue to watch for in future, apparently."
4,Not bad...for a guy.,"The book came recommended to me by a friend who chanced upon it recently. Though it's a bit short and the text studders in a few minor spots, the rules are well thought out. The biggest surprise is that a guy wrote this book. It's a great book to take to the beach and all daters should read it. Good Job."
1,Avoid,"if you wish to read a learned and reliable book on Occult Tibet, I suggest the book Tibetan Yoga. The book Occult Tibet is written by a writer primarily of children's fiction who appears to have gotten into some groove wiriting on various fantasy subjects; he is in other words no authority, just a hack. His book really is no more use than googling the subject. The book Tibetan Yoga, is, on the other hand, the real deal. It is hard to find but available."
3,Introductory,"This is a decent introduction to the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. The writer believes in the inerrancy of Scripture, and that the Old Testament has truth that is applicable to the Christian today. However, it is not for the student who needs to go into a lot of depth."
5,A Must-Have for the RoboHelp Certification exam,"I purchased this book to familiarize myself with RoboHelp 2002 in preparation for the RoboHelp Certified Professional exam (I use version 9). I can't say enough about the quality and value of this book -- it's terrific! The text and exercises are very easy to understand, and really help build skills. I finished the book confident that I could make the most of the tools and features in RoboHelp 2002.NOTE: Apparently, eHelp wouldn't let the author include much information on the uses and applications of the different outputs. The exam includes a disproportionate number of questions on WebHelp, and even JavaHelp and OracleHelp. If you're buying this book to prep for the exam, be sure to supplement this excellent resource with the information in the RoboHelp Help files."
3,Don't buy if you have ever made a help file,"I bought this book because I moved from Forehelp to Robohelp. If you have ever created a help file you absolutely don't need this book. It is very general and basic. The Robohelp tutorial is just fine for learning their product.Why did I buy the book? Simply because Robohelp only gives you a tutorial. I need to know more about the what to do with all the files it produces. How can I get rid of that stupid logo? And lots of other questions when dealing with the web server and other web documents.You won't find technical information in this book. But if you have never created help files, it is an excellent book."
5,Works For Me,I have been taking a Medical Transcription course and this is a good book. It is well written and easy to understand.
3,Great game,Seems like son ebb of the money was missing from my open but not used set. Still it's been fun to mark off all of the places we have been to and would like to visit.
5,Enjoyed this for family game night!,"I bought this for my sister's birthday and the whole family really enjoyed it! There were 5 of us playing, ranging in age from 8-55. Enjoy!"
5,Great cookware! You can't go wrong.,"I have tried other brands of cookware and these are the best at any price I've seen. I own both a set of the Tri-ply stainless and the nonstick Contemporary cookware from Calphalon (bought one and won the other) and both are fantastic. As far as any discoloration on the stainless, try some Bon-Ami or Bartender's Friend powder. Works great and keeps everyting very shiny and clean. All-Clad is fine but for the money you can't beat Calphalon. Calpahlon is owned by Rubbermaid so maybe that explains why it is so good."
2,Convenient but...,"I registered for this swing because I thought it was convenient, being a smaller, hide-away swing and having a reasonable price, but personally, I find the mobile on this swing is useless since it doesn't stay up properly and it doesn't do anything - music or spin around. Instead of wasting $60 on this swing, take a look at the others first, i.e. the Link-A-Doos or Aquarium swings by Fisherprice before buying.I gave this item two stars since it does serve its purpose, it swings back and forth with ajustable speed levels."
4,like the swing :-),"I have used this swing in a childcare setting. It holds up well, and the kids like it.I can't give it 5 stars because it can be difficult to put a baby in, and take out. Also, for a swing, the price is a bit high. I wouldn't spend $60 on it. Its only really worth about $30.UPDATE: TOTALLY Worth the money! VERY sturdy! I babysit several kids in my home. When one was 5 months old, he wouldn't sleep anywhere else. Total Life Saver!When a 39 lbs 6 year old sat in it, (after I asked her not to) I was sure it would be broken. Thank God for small favors (and short children) It didn't break, and didn't even bend!!!I wish I could change it to 5 stars.~Megan the Nanny"
3,cheapest is not always best,I bought this swing just because I didn't want to spend too much money on one and it was the cheapest one they had in the store. Now I wish that I had spent a little more because I am starting to see that this swing is somewhat of a pain to use. The 5 point harness system is the worst thing of all. the straps are constantly being twisted and it really doesn't offer that much support to the baby. It is difficult to put the baby in and then have to sit there and untwist the straps to buckle him in. The toys are set way to far away for baby. My son tries to reach them but he can't and since the harness straps suck he always looks like he could actually fall out. I do however like the size of this swing and how easy it is to tote around.
3,i would not purchase this swing again,"I bought this swing in the jackpot print (last year's swing: same swing, different fabric & mobile). I purchased it b/c it was cheaper and smaller. I thought i would like to move the swing on trips or just around the house. I could not justify the difference in price between this smaller swing and the larger swings. I wish i would have. the problem is placing her into the swing. i have to sit on the floor, put my knees to both sides of the swing (to steady the swing) and then strap her in. many of the larger swings, you just slide your baby into them. i wish i would have spent the extra money for a regular swing. THE REASON I GAVE 3 STARS: My little girl does enjoy the swing and it works great, BUT IT IS A PAIN."
4,"Good, not exactly great.","The first 175 pages of the book seem devoted to convincing management that the tool is worth using. The next 75 or so pages give details on writing tests. There are about 45 pages of the programmer's perspective. The rest of the book mainly deals with extending the system in ways that most people won't bother with. Finally there is a very brief word on non-Java tests that simply says to refer to the web sites.The book is easy to read. It is a good book for a programmer to show their boss, or to circulate to the non-programmer staff. Developers should thumb through the book to become familiar with the topics, but use the online wikis to develop a serious understanding."
1,dont buy this box,"my wife recently purchased this watch case for me and it came broken, when we requested to send it back they wanted us to pay out of our own pocket to send it back which would of cost $15 to send it back by the cheapest way possible and on top of that wanted to charge a restocking fee. I am now stuck with it and had to repair the pooor craftsmanship myself. I do not recommend this case to anyone unless you would like to basically rebuild it yourself."
2,Disappointed,I liked the cover when it arrived but I was concerned the fabric was on the thin side. I was right because at just over a year it became brittle and ripped easily. While it works better than the cheap crap at the bargain stores it still is not thick enough to truly last a long time. I had a similar experience with the fire pit cover.
2,Too short and always damp.,"I like the cloth feel and look, but it is not as weather-resistant as I had hoped. It is moldy after only half a winter's use. And it was not long enough for our small Charbroil Grill, leaving at least a foot exposed at the bottom."
5,Strawberry love,"I ordered this for my daughter's first ""big girl bed"" it came quick with no problems. Our daughter LOVES sleeping everynight with Strawberry shortcake everywhere! This was a great hit!"
4,Excellent Product,"The only problem is that from six season, not spanish close caption are provided. But is excellent product, I liked so much"
2,don't always get what you pay for,I bought these for my mom but I did'nt give them to her because to me they kind of look cheep. The way they sit in your ears the back shows. The back looks the same as many earrings do which is just fine if it does'nt show. The front of the earring is nice it's to bad they did'nt continue with that on the back. I did buy other earrings for half the price from another seller and they where great. I guess you don't always get what you pay for.
3,marginally entertaining story with space opera qualities.,"Shatner writes like Kirk acts; boldly and melodramatically. The quick-paced plot is a series of macho scenes with our Hero racing full steam ahead. In the same way Bond never misteps, Benton Hawkes has the somewhat tedious ability to always zig at the right time. (An example scene: Hawkes just happens to have his ceremonial sword at his side in time to thwart an invasion of space pirates.)Still, an amusing story and a fast read for a rainy day."
4,Romina Power was 16,"To correct the editorial review. Romina was born October 2, 1951. The film was released in 1968. Even as prolific as Jess Franco was, a 60 day schedule from filming to release is unlikely. She had to be 16. This is another piece of cult erotica that the true Franco fan will enjoy."
3,Crime and virtue,"If you're not strong, you won't be able to see this film. Nudity and sadistic violence are present in the memorable story of two sisters, Justine and Juliette, adapted from a novel by Marquis de Sade. Living in a convent, they stood apart when their mother dies. Hopeless and without money, they take different ways. Juliette seeks pleasure and soon learn how to murder, to cheat, to do everything in order to get rich and powerful. Justine, on the other hand, lives a life of pain, despair, but keeping a virtuous behaviour. Throughout the film we are invited to answer a very delicate question: is it worth to be virtuous and suffering all the time instead of being wicked but happy at all? The answer remains on our minds, on our deepest values. Anyway, it's a good movie with a fine score by Bruno Nicolai."
4,Campy classic underground film,"If you know what you are going to be seeing before you view it, this movie is well worth purchasing. I bought it for the campy, artsy quality that it possesses. But I think you really have to enjoy watching 60's type films to appreciate it as there are numerous disjointed leaps from one scene into another. The soundtrack is somewhat gravelly at times but it can be lived with. Romina Power is excellent as Justine and Jack Palance is hilarious in a creepy kind of way as the mad monk. Yes, the movie is downright strange, but that is to expected and lends to the beauty of this classic flick. The extras at the end are nicely put together. The poster and stills section is well done, as well as the French trailer."
4,Innocence in trouble,"Romina Power as Justine is lovely innocense to look at, and I enjoyed what otherwise is a trite sadistic movie just to see her charms."
2,Fast forward review,"For sex sleaze fans, any more sleaze on the DVD than on the tape? Nope, sorry, same scenes. The quality is very nice, so you'll never see the hankerchief-sniffing branding scene looking so good.One thing I noticed in fast-forwarding through this awful thing (nice DVD advantage there), is that aside from the ""M"" scene there's really not much. The sixteen year-old Romina is stunningly cute, and you can clip the pictures of her hanging from a chain leaking poor quality Franco fake blood and doing a ""Pretty Baby"" couch turn, but the green and red lighting is actually not very erotic.Most other sexploitation flicks have a lot more graphic nastiness, but the branding scene is a must, there's no question about that. One star for that, and one star for brief lolita Romina nudity, that's it."
3,"Romina Power can't do all the work, the writers need to help!","Romina Power is interesting to watch in this flick, but overall, the story needs more help then she can deliver."
1,Note that this version has been cut,"Note that this version has been cut by 20 minutes (the full-length version is also available here on Amazon), i.e. there is no reason at all to be interested in this version unless, for reasons that can be known only to yourself, you have the truly wierd desire to see a Jess Franco movie with the squelchy bits cut out."
3,Fun seeing Jack Palance soused --,"As director Jesus Franco says in an accompanying interview, Jack Palance would start guzzling red wine at 7 in the morning the days his scenes were to be filmed, and BOY, can you tell it in the finished product! There are lots of pretty scenes, photography, costumes, people, etc., but it's mostly a bore. I recommend EUGENIE DE SADE for anyone dipping their toe into Franco ...."
4,Great Customer Service...,"I purchased the EX22 a few weeks ago and am overall, very happy. Delivery was fairly quick, considering it was freight and over the Thanksgiving holiday. The elliptical was very easy to assemble, but due to a few minor defects, it rubbed on the plastic when going in reverse and the right pedal made a clicking sound. I called Horizon customer service and they helped diagnose the problem, ordered parts and sent someone out to install the new parts. The machine is now working fine and I am very happy with it. It has a somewhat compact design compared with other ellipticals I looked at which is perfect if space is a concern. The only thing I am not thrilled with is the loud chirping the electronic console makes when setting a program. It is very annoying. Oh, and I wish I would have known this was going to be a part of the Amazon Customers Vote promotion BEFORE purchasing the machine--oh well, that's life!"
5,Best Elliptical for the Money,"I wasn't sure about ordering this elliptical online but for the money ($200) I just couldn't pass it up. So glad I didn't!! This is a well built machine, surprisingly quiet and stable. It took less than an hour to assemble and very easy to use. Perfect for a beginner, like me. Even though this is supposed to be low impact, the motion sometimes hurts my knees (arthritis) but warming up and stretching beforehand reduces this problem."
4,Love it!,"I ordered this elliptical in December and it arrived very quickly. It was easy to set up (took my fiance and I approximately 30 min to set up). I've been using it regularly ever since and absolutely love it. I was worried that it might feel unsturdy like some of the cheaper ellipticals do. However, it's very stable, quiet, and a great workout. The only complaint I have with it at all is that a small piece of the plastic was broken when it arrived, but the piece was not a weight baring part so is merely a cosmetic problem. I did not find it a big enough deal to even worry about trying to exchange it."
4,Can't beat this for the price,"I was one of the lucky ones who was able to purchase this product for $200. The elliptical did arrive with a bent frame. Since this model was sold out, Amazon offered me my money back or another model that was refurbished. Since I didn't want a refurbished model or my money back, they credited my account with $30 on a future purchase. I then called Horizon Fitness and they had me take a picture of the problem and email it to them. They then sent me new parts and a service man to come out and fix the problem. Now that it is put together, I am extemely satisfied. It gives me the same workout as the gym. It has 4 preset workouts (or you can set it manually), calorie counter, heartrate monitor, and timer. The only displeasure I have with the product, is there is no water bottle holder. Other than that, perfect."
3,"Good, but could have been a lot better!","This is a fairly decent snapshot of an older band in its latter performing years. good solid playing but vocals a bit below par. Still, just ok vocals and good playing is better than most of the rubbish that passes for live music these days. Disappointed at no ""Part of the Union"" too."
5,Exceptional Edith .....,"I am very fond of authors who consistently achieve high standards of story-telling, well developed characters, evocative descriptions, historical accuracy and honed, polished prose. Edith Layton rarely fails on any of these points.Layton usually tells her stories from the masculine point of view, again, something which I relish, and in this novel, Sir Alasdair St Erth is a man whom we learn has some very dark secrets. The author often has exceptionally deep, troubled heroes and here is another! He has many redeeming qualities but there is enough about him that is flawed and troublesome to make him a most attractive and sympathetic hero.At first, her heroines often try the sceptical reader but, in this as in others of her novels, the heroine, Kate Corbet, develops into a wholly credible figure who is the ultimate salvation of the hero.As always with this brilliant author, a wonderful read and highly recommended."
3,A worthy read,"From the reviews amde for this book, i had expected alot more from the book. I am a book a day person and usually when i am engrosed in a book, i won't put it down. However, for this book i didn't feel a great urge to read it continuously. Hence for me the book was missing an important element. Maybe it is because i don't enjoy revengeful plots, but even so in my opinion something is missing in this book/"
1,Seeds for nothing - didn't grow,I don't know why but these seeds never produced any flowers. I did everything they instructed but the result was disappointing.
5,Good read,"This is one of her books that I bought not only the hardback but also the paperback, audio and Kindle."
5,The return of Rafe MacKade,I give it 5stars! It a great read anytime. You feel like you are there great romance. Loved the ghost stories and where it takes place. You feel the love of family in these books.
2,Meh.,"I don't find a book with a sub plot about escaping an abusive husband amusing when the two main characters express their ""love"" with anger and mild violence. If you need a quick cheap read this is the book for you. Not her best story."
4,The Return of Rafe MacKade,I enjoyed reading about all of the Mackade Brothers and would certainly recommend to those who like Nora Roberts books.
4,Love!,Love all of Nora Robert's books especially bad boy Rafe MacKade. The developing relationship between the characters is believable and keeps your attention through to the end.
5,The Return of Rafe MacKade,Once again Nora Roberts has written a really good story about people and love. Her characters come alive in her novels.
3,Good but Nora Roberts has done it better,"I expected more from this series. When I read it I realized Ms Roberts had similar characters in a similar backround, dealing with similar issues in a series that starts with ""The Next Alawys"" . That 3 book set features the Montgomery brothers (only 3) and is set in Boonsboro NC (very close to Antitem). I love the Civil War ghosts and how they interact with the characters; however I felt the story was much better told in ""The Next Always"" and the two books following it. I am not sure which series she wrote first, but if you like this one you'll love that one"
5,A page turner very captivating,Rafe MacKade is a book I will like to read over and over again.I am a subscriber to Hariliquin books. I love to read
3,Good Read,This is the first book in the series about the MacKade brothers. All the books are very good read. The last one was my least favorite. I would however recommend them all ...
1,More of the same,This book is more of the same junk she writes but worst because it lacks originality. I would not purchase or read any more of her work. I don't recommend her work to anyone.
5,Love me some mackades,Loved the chemistry between rafe and Regan. Could not put down the book. Can't wait to read about the brothers..com
4,Love it!,"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this book! Great story line. If you like Nora Roberts books, you'll love this series!"
3,Good Read,"First of the four MacKade books. (Also, the first I have bought off Nora Roberts' back list since her publisher started price gouging Spring 2010. These books are $5 each.)The author creates her usual likeable characters in a strong small town setting, with plenty of romance and humor, all lightly flavored with Civil War history and a couple of ghosts.This is probably my least favorite of the four, mostly because of the hero's behaviour in the last quarter of the book. SPOLIER ALERT: The heroine has some trouble and he makes it all about him, then turns ugly because she doesn't need him enough. Typically male, but I don't read romances for the typical. And it drives me crazy when no one calls him on his attitude.Still, it's a quick and enjoyable read and will leave you eager for the next story."
4,Rafe and Regan,"A good solid introduction to a series of brothers that just gets better. In Rafe's story, Regan makes a fine heroine for the wild Rafe. It's a well written story that never really goes wrong. A solid Nora Roberts.4/5 stars"
1,not pleased,"we ordered 6 of these. 5 would not hold air when we aired them up. tubes were leaking from the word go. they were stacked and wrapped with plastic wrap in batches of 3 and thats how they were shipped. that resulted in 4 of them having been beat up in transport making them out of round"" wobbly"" when we mounted them up........dissapointed is being nice."
4,Good Value Spoked Wheel,I found this wheel to be a good value for my old garden cart that originally had two solid rubber wheels. OEM rubber wheels cost over $100 each. With this product I have been able to refurbish my cart rather than discarding it.
4,"grizzly 20"" spoked wheel","The price is right. The wheels work. Some of the spokes needed tightening. Not a big problem and easy to do. The hub is not as wide so I had to put some washers on the axle of my garden cart. Overall I would buy them again. Oh yeah, I ordered 4 and one was missing a spoke, but it still works. Compared to the price of replacement wheels for a garden cart these wheels are a best buy."
1,wackness....,"Yo, this is my own opinion, so here it goes... JUST BECAUSE U GOT AN R&B HOOK AND AN 'OK' BEAT, DONT MAKE IT A GOOD SONG, thats basically why these foos sell, and maybe cause the lil girls think they're 'cute' LMAO. Production may be ok, but lyrics are trash, straight up. Too many latino rappers tryin to make it big off this love song s---. Same with Baby Bash album...nothing but songs about smokin, girls, and being a ""playa"". Step ya game up and rap about something thats real...1"
4,Love it!!,"I knew Nbridaz would come through!! I love this cd. It gets me from Cali to Tejas with no problem! Haters gonna talk, but thats ok...I really love Pretty Girl...This whole thing!!"
3,NB Ridaz,"Wow guys, I'm reading a lot of don't hate haters here but I'm not reading any bad reviews. The album has moved a lot of latino's this is true. Yet the hardest thing for Latino Rapper is crossing over to the other heads. Quick break down on this album the average buyer is between the ages of 10-16 and Latino. Putting their clients in the southwest mostly. After you add all this up, damn thats not much.There music is laid over Oldies But Goodies. With easy to follow lyrics. So sorry I just gave the album an average% 3 stars. Yet the group has improved greatly from there Nasty Boy Klick days."
5,nbridaz does it again,This cd is off the chain!!! It's exactly what you expect from them... songs wit great music and great lyrics. And the lyrics are ones anyone can identify wit. I esp. love the cho-n-low tracks cuz they crack you up!!! I actually give this cd 1000 stars.
2,Stop the wining,"A friend recommended me this album. I am sorry to say that I can not do the same. I may be a perfectionist demanding a singer with some sort of musical talent. But the singer in this album tends to wine and scream through out the album. If you like that kind of rock than this album is for you. It reminds of some of the lessor bands out of Seattle in the late 90's (in French of course). This album does have some glimpses of light though. The music itself is very interesting, with a mix of that late 90's grunge/rock feel and euro-rock."
2,Make sure you purchase wall paper paste to hang this border!,"This border realy added the finishing touch to our baby's nursery. Unfortunately, it was not very easy to hang. We followed the instructions perfectly (and this was not the first time that we have ever hung wall paper) but the ""paste"" that came on this border wasn't the least bit sticky. The border slid right down the wall. We had to pull it off and let it dry before we tried again--but this time with the help of real wall paper paste purchased at our local home improvement store. Thankfully, that did the trick!"
4,Superbly functioning pots and pans.,"We have been extremely pleased with our tri-ply set (we have the 8-pc. set plus a number of extra pieces we've picked up). They heat evenly; are durable; the (long) handles really do stay cool; and clean well.Our only complaint is that Calphalon doesn't seem to care about minimizing the number of lids necessary for their cookware. We own only one lid that fits more than one pot/pan (the one for the 10 in. pan, 3 qt. saute, 6 qt. stockpot)--and we have 4 other lids which fit only a single pot, some of which are within 1/2 in. of being the same width!However, we'd still get these pans again in a second, and probably go for the 13-piece set instead of the 8 piece as well."
2,Pans stained after first use,"I was so happy when I received my try-ply stainless set of Calphalon pans for Christmas. After cooking for the first time on one pot and one of the frying pans, I immediately noticed whitish stains on the bottom of the pans. I hand washed them and they did not come out. It was just boiled green beans and sausage. How can it possibly discolor like that? Called Calaphalon, they tell me to contact Amazon, Called Amazon, they tell me to contact the third party seller, Cookware store. It seems it will be a long ordeal to even figure out if this is normal, harmful. covered under warranty and returnable. Can anyone share if they have had the same experience with these pans?"
4,Made in China - but still reasonable quality,"After ordering this set of 8 pieces, I read about the new Calphalon sets being manufactured in China and not being up to the old standards. After all, these days, what is? I'm mostly satisfied with this set except for a few minor complaints; The lids don't really fit well and the rivets for the 6 quart saucepot's handles are a bit loose and tend to ""buzz"" when I knock my spoon on the edge. I saw a review somewhere, where they wanted the old quality, heavier product, but I think the heft of these pieces is just about right. I will purchase additional Calphalon items to compliment this set, such as the 12"" saute."
4,Why pay more...,"...for this CD when you can buy Uber Kommandoh, which has both Udu Wudu and Attahk. But I digress. Is it gospel music or rock and roll? Regardless, my favs are Dondai and Last Seven Minutes. The background chorus on Last Seven Minutes is amazing."
5,It's My Turn,I found it delightful and inspiring to discover that Ruth Bell Graham was a prized individual in her own right--as well as being Mrs. Billy Graham.
2,Fix it 4.0 - Beware,"I purchased fix it 4.0 about 2 months ago and still can't get it to install and work properly, even though I have written numerous emails to their support staff. They still can not resolve my problem. One of the major problems with this product is it has recently been bought over by vcom from ontrack. Unlike ontrack, vcom does not offer phone support on this product, only email support for 60 days, so if you run in to a problem during installation, you are basically left on your own.They will only answer your questions by email within 24-48 hours. Vcom can't say for sure if they will ever offer phone support either on this product! I was told that their support staff were still being trained on the product itself. Interesting!!So, unless you are a gambler and would like to take a chance on the program installing with no problems, I would NOT buy this product. BEWARE!"
1,Beware - You may never get it!,"I ordered Fix-it 4.0 on Jan 29, 2004. Today is February 25th and have still not got it. I have sent 2 emails and have received no reply. I have written to Amazon but looks like they have not been able to do anything. Only thing they can do is return my money after waiting even longer and spending time on filling out forms. I am surprised the product is still on the list."
4,Definitely enjoyed it,"Good enough for me. I haven't played in years but I enjoyed this movie. Clearly the budget couldn't compare to that of LotR. Apart from the 'above average' CGI this movie was a pleasure though. The actors took their roles seriously (which is not often the case is Sci-Fi/Fantasy flicks), the script was tight and there was a good balance of hard-core knowledge with newbie explanation scenes. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with even the smallest exposure to D&D."
1,"Idiotic, pathetic","Stuipd movie.I am a D&D; gamer for seven years now,and have no intensions to stop playing, so I could understand the way iconic monsters, spells and game mechnics were waved into the plot.Thing is, this movie is so bad that it made me angry. It is becuse of things such as ""Wrath of the dragon god"" that D&D; is underastimated by many people. The plot was infantile, the charcters so boering that as a DM I would have killed their players just for the intension to play them.Another issiue was that the charcters had no in game logic- I remember a scene where the fighter (who is, of course, the leader) send the wizard to the front line of a large meele battle, to cover him while he solves a riddle. C'ommon, guys! if you want to call a movie ""D&D;"" than at least try to make it feel like a real game."
1,So bad its not even good.,"I rented this hoping for a fast, furious adventure flick. Instead I found this movie pretty much bored me: especially the first 20-30 minutes. The story? A washed out ex-fighter and his mage wife discover a cursed mountain is really the home of an ancient dragon. Can he and a band of 4 other adventurers find a mystic orb which will save the realm?I like cheesy movies, but D&D; 2 was pretty much as bad as it gets. With the exception of the actor who played Nim (the Rogue), most of the acting was of the quality produced by first year drama majors reading lines from a script. The settings were drab (mostly browns and tan), and the spectacular D&D; universe reduced to a bunch of cheesy CGI special effects.My advice: save your money and rent. 1 star"
3,Wrath of the dragon god,this movie is better than the first.I have always been enterested in D&D for its creativity & beauty.{FLINDS}are my favorite character from the games!!!!for hyenas rock!!!!!and {FLINDS}are muscular and perfictly built!!!!!!as for this movie its good and has some neat special affects as well as more game related stuff than the first dvd movie.it gives a glimps of what a real D&D movie would look like.
4,Good for what it is,im satisfied with this movie. It is much better then the first D&D movie and for being low budget the acting and quality isn't that bad.
1,Lackluster very very low budget movie,"The costumes are cheap cosplay types, with fake leather, etc and its obvious they are using foam weapons and armors. Even the half orc and the lich have very minor roles in this movie. The ""bandits"" look much like fake townpeople with fake weapons added to them. Very choppy plot and very badly played villian. This is low even by Sci Fi channel movie standard and they had made plenty of crap horror films so far thus they should had been renamed Bad Horror Movie Channel."
2,It is what it is,"Is this an Oscar winner? No. This isn't even a ""good"" movie. As always, the people who put these kinds of movies together don't know what they're doing, but they know they'll always have a niche market, so a good product with broad appeal isn't necessary to make money. Ergo, the movie gets made.If you're not a D&D; fan, you shouldn't even consider seeing this movie; your life will be devalued by the memory. If you *are* a D&D; fan, you'll likely find it entertaining, but it's still not that good even to you. As a D&D; fan, you want this to encompass the entire D&D; universe of monsters, character classes, traps, etc. Because it's a 90 minute movie on a limited budget, you won't get that. So, it's worth watching, but not much better than that.Bottom line: it's worth watching *only* because it's D&D.; If that doesn't appeal to you, this is a complete waste of time."
3,Much better than the first,"This was much better than the first cornball movie with Jeremy Irons horrible overacting and camp tone. No academy award performances here, but if you are looking for light entertainment based on the D & D game this is the movie for you. Characters are still one dimensional, and production values are low, but you get what you would expect from this movie."
3,"Only a 2-star movie, but a 4-star D&D movie.","Judged as a movie in general, this isn't very good. In fact, it's below average. Not bad, but below average. In star-rating terms: 2 stars.But, judged specifically as a D&D; movie, it's actually pretty good. In fact, it's above average. Not great, but above average. In star-rating terms: 4 stars.So, on average, I'd say this is an average-quality, 3-star movie.And, for D&D; players, it's a treat to watch the extra bit in which Gary Gygax assesses how well certain specific elements of the movie accord with his vision of D&D;."
2,Sequel,"This dull sequel to the Dungeons & Dragons movie (NOT the awesome Dragons of Autumn Twilight!!!) has little to offer other than a couple dragon scenes. It was filmed in Lithuania. The makers of this film tried not only to appease fans of the D & D game, but action/ sci fi fans also. Worth seeing once or twice, but it's nothing special."
3,disappointed again,another low budget B 'dragon' movie. You can watch for D&D sake. I think D&D has a greater universe than Eragon or HP as a fantastic world. needs a good script and director and of course big budget.
3,not as bad as everyone wrote,ok... i ll agree that this isnt the best movie ever.. but it has its moments. the acting wasnt that bad... but the movie wasnt like the game that much.. i wanted more traps and stuff... but i bought it and im standing by that purchase.
1,Stupid Stupid Movie,"I have been a D&D player for years now and yes I have to say that I can see that they actually pulled from D&D to make this movie. It is nearly impossible to watch, though. The lines are horrible, the acting is horrible, and the plot doesn't work. If they were going to keep with the original movie then keep with it or come up with something new. They used one character and tried to make it seem like it was 100 years later but it didn't work. There were possible subplots that could have gone somewhere but didn't. This movie was stupid and uninteresting from beginning to end. At least with the first one you could make fun of the stupidity, I still make fun of Snails. I would recommend watching something else, like grass grow, than this movie."
1,I would give it 0 stars but thats not an option.,"Dear sweet lord I don't know what on this green Earth could have enticed WotC (Wizards of the Coast) to want to non the less make a sequel to one of the worst fantasy fix of all times. Oh that's right I said it. When the original came out people thought it was ok (if they smoked crack) simply because it had nothing else from the decade before it to compare to. Sure on the list of films like YOR: Hunter from the future, Krull and Kull the conqueror, it was a fine piece of.... cinema? Real toast to impractical weapons and lame special effects, Cheers! So if you really like watching train wrecks (oh and believe me I do) then pick this thing up for your next Bad movie night. Just remember to use gloves."
3,Good But cut short,"Ok, This is truly the first Dungeons and Dragons movie out there. It deserves the name unlike the first movie which i do have in my dvd collection.The only problem I have with the movie is this, You get to the end of the movie and it's like they ran out of money or Time. The ending is really cut short, i'm sorry but if you are expecting a huge nice rap up of the movie after the defeat of the bad guys forget it. They don't say a word and you see the characters just doing stuff then the movie cuts out. It's short and just doesn't fit right with the movie. I mean come on the main fighter hero doesn't kiss his girl at the end? What type of ending is this?It's a let down i'm sorry but it left a bad taste in my mouth at the end, it was great but it ended wierd."
3,Delivery,"I'd like to review this movie, but I haven't actually received it from Amazon. I ordered it back in October before the DVD was released and still have not received it. They keep delaying the shipping date. When I contacted customer service to complain, I was basically told there was nothing I could do. Has anybody who ordered this movie from Amazon actually received their copy?"
4,Why is this movie rated R?,I am very interested in buying this movie for my 9 year old son. Is it rated R because of the monsters or sexual content? My son can watch Alien vs. Predator without flinching and loves dragons and wizards but I am hesitant because of the rating.
4,Dungeons and Dragons. What else needs to be said. :),"First I must start with I did enjoy watching the first one. Knowing Solomon's time and money constraints. Well done. Now onto the new movie. Of course the direction, sets and acting is much better. But I am sure so was the budget. The characters were well cast. It is a shame that Mr. Solomon did not participate in some way though.I loved watching how when you watched this movie I could relate to some of the charcaters you have played. The magic is well done as are the monsters. If you will excuse the term, this movie is much more realistic then the first one. You will watch as the standard five member party negotiate traps, fight monsters and use magic to get out of trouble.You can preview the movie on the SciFi channel next week. And I plan to purchase the DvD as soon as it is released. So watch it, you will find it enjoyable."
4,Dungeons and Dragons 2,"I also saw the Screener today and thought it was far superior in everyway than the first, well apart from the special effects but they were still believeable. This is how the first movie should have been, The script, the acting and the atmosphere, in fact everything about this film is better than the first. Great interaction between the Rogue and Barbarian. Damidar is actually believeable in this film, Great references to actually DnD and we get to see alot of magic not just the magic dust from the first movie. Very big improvement on the first and alot more serious (no more snails, GREAT) i definately reccommend it. Rumours of a third movie already and all i can say is hope its like the 2nd not the 1st."
2,Starts out well.,"The movie is better than I expected. The cgi effects are well done. If you are into D&D, I think you will like it."
4,Satisfied.,This is a hard-to-find title and so I am happy with the video that I received (even though it is on tape).
3,Warning!,"This title, among quite a few now listed on Amazon, is available directly from the Warner Archive for only $19.95. Why pay more?"
1,disappointed,I am going to a free INXS concert later in the summer and wanted a Greatest Hits to become more familiar with their music. This WASN'T it. This turned out to be a compilation of the band's favorite unrecognized songs -hardly greatest hits....
1,Very Disappointing Read,"Whe I picked this book up I thought it was going to be good, but it only took me one night to discover how wrong I was. The book's value is not in what it says, but in its ability to act as an all-purpose sleep aid. A real snoozer that I glady returned."
4,Whose Whining,"In response to one of the prior reviewers:1) This book hardly deserves to be called literature. ""War and Peace"", it's not.2) It sounded like the author was doing a lot of whining, from the few chapters I read. Business is not school.3) When professionals respond negatively to an outsider's commentary, they are typically not doing so out of a sense of wounded virtue. People that work on The Street know all too well the realities of finance. Rather, they become angry when they see the author fool the many readers who do not have much business experience. It's not that the portrayal is too harsh or unfair, just that it is inaccurate and designed to elicit a predictable reaction from naive readers."
2,It's Hard!,"Big money (that is, more money than it takes to get into Harvard after attending a private high school, and the ability to afford to live in a ""cottage"" in a crime free area and pay off two cars before you reach age 30) is the root of all evil. Hypocritical rich bashing is in again - as the movie Titanic has shown - and this book might make the author and his publisher a lot of money. Ultimately his diatribes serve to annoy rather than enlighten, leaving you cold. This is a hackneyed story told by a puling man."
1,A disappointing read and boring personal account,This book is a recycle of old ideas and tired themes. The volume makes me wonder if the publisher was sober at the time Mr. Stiles' contract was penned. Liars Poker and Den of Thives etc have gone over this ground before and for the life of my I can't find a reason to rehash the subject matter again.
2,No Liar's Poker,"Paul Stiles' whining gets on your nerves after a while. If ""standard"" Merrill training genuinely is no training...yet Merrill possesses one of the best trading arms in the world...the vast majority of the recruits must've been smart enough to pick things up as they went along, which seems to indicate a shortcoming in Stiles rather than the system. It's unfortunate but understandable that Stiles lacked the ability or intestinal fortitiude to excell in what is an extremely difficult (both mentally and emotionally) position. However, it is even more unfortunate that he blames society and those around him for his own greed-driven decisions, making this book a exemplary whine-fest. The only redeeming feature: some relatively interesting asides about the technical aspects of a trading desk. Read Liar's Poker (Lewis, non-fiction) or The Bombardiers (Bronson, fiction) for much better and more entertaining Wall Street bedtime stories."
2,Stiles still doesn't get it,"The only similarity between this book and Liar's Poker is that they are both about Wall Street. Rather than blame himself for seeking out and then accepting a job he knew he was ill-prepared for, in a city he knew nothing about, Stiles blames everyone and everything else. This, in essence, is why Stiles never made it. NYC and Wall Street are not the types of places for people who are always waiting for something to come to them - you have to go out and get it.Stiles book has some interesting passages, though it is very clear that he still does not understand why it didn't all work out. Despite the fact that he was ""never trained"", his passages about the Mexican Peso devaluation and the Orange County Scandal are good summaries. If you work on Wall Street, this book will be entertaining. If you are thinking of working on Wall Street and are as naive as Stiles about ""the life"", this book will be useful. Otherwise, take a pass and read Michael Lewis's Liar's Poker."
1,Painful to Read,"I like to pride myself that I have never started a book and not finished it, but this one came very close to breaking the streak.What I envisioned was a moving expose of breaking into the Wall Street fraternity (a la Liar's Poker). Reality was excessant whining on how people weren't nice and were too greedy. Go figure...on Wall Street.The most irritating part of the whole book is that the author obtained his job through the same trickery which he bashes for 300+ pages in the book, but never acknowledges that the others were simply better at the ruse than him. Rather, he waxes prophetic on how his life has a higher meaning. It's just not even close to believable."
3,What was this guy thinking?,"""I got a job on Wall Street. They were mean to me, and very greedy. Before I could quit, they fired me.""O.K. there was more to it than that but you get the picture. I found his portrayal of adjusting to life in NYC more interesting than reading about his work life at Merrill Lynch. I'm still surprised at how someone with absolutely zero background in anything even remotely connected to business, finance or Latin America could actually land a real job at the emerging markets bond trading desk of ML. Don't you have to know anything?...But I did find the book entertaining and I even learned a little bit about fixed income securites. I would recommend it to any ""outsider"" considering moving to NYC or working in the I-banking world."
3,"""Bull"" Somewhere in the Middle","We don't learn much new about the greed that exists on Wall Street (and everywhere else in the U.S., for that matter), but I found the book interesting and entertaining. The question is: What was Stiles looking for in the first place, other than cold, hard cash? Job satsifaction? Cameraderie with his fellow Merrill employees? Long-lasting friendships? His experience was the same as most of us who have spent time in corporate America: backstabbing, greed, criticism for taking iniative, etc. Welcome to the real world. If you want to read a truly humorous book on options trading, try ""The New Gatsbys."" It's been around a few years but it's terrific."
4,"Rings so very, very true","The book insightfully presents the awful working conditions of working on ""the Street."" As a former trader myself, I could empathize. I would encourage anyone considering entering the trading profession to read the book -- and then go find yourself a fulfilling livelihood, something of worth and value."
2,not quite the book i was expecting,"A bit of a disappointment . I was expecting to read about a guys year at ML. Instead I read about his personal trials and tribulations that was going on in his mind and in his after-work life. If someone was wanting a book on how or what it is like to work at ML I would hesitate in recommending. The book did not focus enough on this guys work environment and of what happened there and how he coped in the financial markets - and not just about him - but about others. Unfortunately it seemed as though he had a quota of pages he had to fill in order to get the book published. Should be titled ""My Year In New York"""
3,Works Great--Too Bad it Has BPA in Them,"My friend gave me 2 packs of Soothies, which she said her some of her kids would not do without. Unfortunately, my son hated them (babies don't care if what you give them is BPA or not). The Soothies were too big for his mouth and were not contoured to fit his mouth--it just looked clunky. Then I tried using some of the old pacis she had and this one worked perfectly on him. He will not use any other paci, even a 3-6M Avent paci (he is 6M); unfortunately, now that I am looking for new Avent pacis for him--I see that it is not BPA-free... darn. I don't know what else is comparable that he will accept other than this, and I don't want to waste money on pacis that won't work. Hopefully Avent will learn and create a non-BPA paci in this design/size."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I received these pacifiers at my baby shower and after doing some research i found out that they are not BPA free, so in the trash they went."
2,Skims on Details,"I found the book to be a good high level view of most of the broadband technologies offered, but it skimps on details of different protocols and fails to even mention line rates of technologies such as T2, T3.Good for someone who wants in intro to Broadband, but not for a serious developer in the field."
4,A nice little module,"Not a bad little adventure. It is fairly simple, but that also makes it easy to adapt into an ongoing campaign. For example, I easily changed parts of it to fit into a much larger story. The adventure also outlines a town. It doesn't give you a lot of information about the town, but with a little work the town also will also work for more play. My players have decided to use the town as their base of operations."
5,The Best,"To Amazon.comI would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your service, treatment and Calphalon wok I purchased a few weeks ago. It all has been nothing short of the absolute best. You've got a lifelong customer! My sister and mom will also be purchasing the same product through Amazon.com. I really have to commend you on your attention to my order and delivering in on time. In today's business environment too many companies don't get it, you obviously understand that customer service is more important than ever. In my correspondence with Tammy, your customer service associate, she displayed a total professional yet friendly conduct. I really liked her can-do attitude, not to mention the quality of the product I purchased from you. I just love my new wok! Shashi Gupta"
3,Cooks Great...But looks like my Tail Pipe,"There's really no excuse. This is a fabulous pan, and it cooks fantastically well. But the huge surface area of the inside is so discolored, and after only one use, that I hate looking at it for fear it's in pain. Let's face it, with a pan of this design, you're almost always looking down at the inside when it's not in use. And it has such a kaleidoscope of coloring from the cooking process that it makes you wonder if it is quality metal. It cooks well, and cleaning it is a breeze, but from a maker like Calphalon, there is just no excuse."
1,"Its Calphalon, but....","I love me some Calphalon.Every pot/pan/baking tool I own is Calphalon. However, the stainless steel line is so hard to clean. The anondized aluminum is sometimes is chore, and requires a chore boy. However the stainless steel items are rarely used because they are so hard to keep clean. I should have just bought some steel pans from the local restraunt supply store."
1,Corsair 2G Memory Upgrade,"After installing the memory chip in my Samsung NC-20 netbook, the system produces an error or crash every 2-5 minutes.I informed Corsair Tech Support about the problem, and didn't hear anything for four days. And, I only received a response after emailing customer service on the third day.It turns out that I have to seek a Return Authorization. Assuming that they grant the authorization, the next step is for me to de-install the unit, and send it back to them. They will test it. If they don't detect any problem, they will send the original unit back to me. Otherwise they will replace the unit. In the meantime, I am without the needed memory upgrade.At this point, I am not favorably impressed with their products or services. So, I would prefer a refund. However, they do not grant refunds."
1,Faulty item.,The item was rated at 2GB but tested at only 5MB. Vendor quickly refunded purchase price after a report was filed but one whole week was wasted.
5,Good to speed up my system,"My system was running slow, so after many things, finally decided to increase the amount of RAM to the system and now is running very smooth."
5,good,good haven't had any problems would buy another one if i needed it. i recommend that if you need it you buy it its for a good price.
5,Nice upgrade!,Superb performance boost on my dell inspiron 1525... went from 2 to 4 GB. Running for now windows xp sp3. I'll install windows 7 64 as soon as I get a better cpu.
4,A lot faster and a lot hotter!,"It works really well on my sony vaio, however, the heat generated is three times that it were."
2,Not reliable,"It's unreliable. I got this module also. It did not work in pair with the same module on one laptop which was running Vista Home Premium dumping memory. it did the same with another laptop (which was running Windows 7 ) once, then it worked for 20 minutes and freeze Win7 completely. It worked with another 1Gb module (different brand) on iMac. I do not think I ever gonna buy Corsair again."
5,Additional Ram Memory,Product is very good and installation was a breeze. Manufacture provides step by step instructions for installing their product. I also used the laptop user manual to review step by step instructions for removing laptop cover.
2,not worth the money,"Some of it is good informatino, but a lot of it is common sense. If you are cluelees get this book, if not skip it."
2,Kindle edition is NOT the Bevan translation,"If you click for the Kindle edition from the print edition of the Bevan translation, you will get the Reeve translation. In fact, I just downloaded eight samples of various editions for Kindle, and they're ALL the Reeve translation. For this book, I really wouldn't mind paying a real, non-public domain price for, say, the Lawrence translation. I don't mean to downgrade DeToqueville in any way, but there doesn't seem to be any other way to bring this to the attention of my fellow customers."
1,NONSENSE,It is rediculus that I have to pay so much for shipping for a freaking pacifier...you need to stop getting over people!!
1,annoyed,You request an e-mail from us to give you a preference of color. Why bother? I requested pink or green (for a baby girl) and was sent a blue.
5,scary,This movie is about a family whose baby is kidnapped but the police don't believe them. They think the parents killed the baby. And they have to prove that they are telling the truth.
5,relaxing hour,This video is a mello overview of New England. It consists of short clips of ariel footage spliced together with gentle background music. It is extremely relaxing!
5,4.5 Stars for an excellent read.,"There are a million and one books out there under the banner of historical fiction - and it can become quite challenging trying to find titles worth investing your reading time in.In this instance, I will save you some time and suggest Men of Bronze as a worthy investment - as it's an absolute pleasure to read. It's exciting, engaging and well written. The characters - friend and foe alike - are fantastic.This was my first Oden book - but will not be my last.If you want something a little gritty, as well as informative and entertaining - Grab this one. It's great."
5,Awesome Book,This a great book and story. It is an exceptionally entertaining drama for those who might not even be interested in the historical period. It would make a fantastic audio book.
4,Solid historical epic,"Great historical epic, rich in details from daily life to battlefield carnage. Setups and payoffs work well from the opening skirmish, through the political intrigue through to the crescendo of the final battle."
2,Really thin for how thick the book is.,"Thin plot, thin characters, and thin history. This book does not give any sensation of its time and place. The characters do not seem like real people. In fact, Barca, the main character, is more Conan/Superman than real man. It is mildly entertaining, hence the 2 stars, but it is not good historical fiction and actually feels much closer to sensational fantasy."
1,Innacurate about Judea,"In this novel Men of Bronze the narrative takes us the Holy Land-it mention the Jews there-even though they had returned from exile in Babylon by then and were the majority there. You mainly focus Philistines, Canaanites (the latter which had long ceased to exist) etc. Also you refer to Judea as 'Palestine even though the name Palestine was only vreated by the Romans in 70 CE. why is that????"
3,More Memphis on the Mississippi than Memphis on the Nile,"This was a disappointment.Although Oden seems to have a grasp of the era, the book simply did not grap me. Perhaps because the author seemed never able to leave his own era and its prejudices behind (ahead?) and truly embrace the era in which his characters supposedly lived, breathed, fought, loved and died.I will give his work another chance, however. There is a lot of ability, just not yet marshalled."
2,This is written like a comic book,"Set just before the Persian invasion of Egypt in 526BC, the book tells the story of loyal Phoenician mercenary superhero, Barca, in his quest to save Egypt from the disloyal Greek mercenary and traitorous villain, Phanes.This book is laughable in its simplicity. It really is like a comic book. If you want to read historical fiction on the level of S. Pressfield, or even S. Saylor, don't even bother with this one. If you want a book that reads like a sequel to a Conan the Barbarian book, then this is the one for you.I just couldn't get over how divorced from reality this book is. You can almost read Barca's spandex superhero outfit between the lines.Finally, I found it shocking that a bath scene with two men and a woman was described. Fine for adult literature, but it was pretty out of place here. I mean, I enjoyed the details, but it was really inappropriate."
1,What an absolutely silly book,"Mind you, silly books have a place in the world. Sometimes its nice to relax your mind and get lost in a totally improbable story. Sadly, this book isn't even enjoyably silly. The characters are banal and easily predictable. The battle scenes aren't that exciting and can easily be skimmed over. What really got on my nerves was the author's tendency to get overly descriptive over every little thing. Scott Oden needs to learn that it's okay to say the sky was blue and leave it at that."
4,Treachery galore,"Scott Oden has managed to capture what surely must be one of the most interesting depictions of ancient Egypt since Mika Waltari published his novel The Egyptian. Both deal with critical periods in Egyptian history and both are credits to their authors.Oden's Men of Bronze is more earthy than The Egyptian and certainly more graphic. The premise of internal decay within Egypt and external pressure from Persia is a common theme. I thought the primary character of Hasdrabal Barca, a commited and driven soldier dedicated to the Pharoah and his dynasty was captivating. Phanes, the Greek traitor was equally memorable but for different reasons. Even given the slow start, as pointed out by another reviewer, isn't enough to prevent me from highly recommending this book.Men of Bronze is a rapidly paced story that will leave you with memorable images in your head. I highly recommend this book."
5,This book is a yummy delight!,"A humorous yet at times poignant account of one woman's life, loves, and confectionary favorites, from her childhood addiction to a homemade sugar paste, to junior mints, to Petite Fruits, Jelly Fruit Wedges, and frosting eaten straight from the can (I thought I was the only one who did that!) A factual account that is as entertaining as any fiction story i have come across. I recommend it highly. A real sweetie of a book!"
4,the icing on the cake!,"not having a sweet-tooth myself, i found ms. liftin's ability to consume confectionary treats absolutely stunning. her ability to write about them is even better. this novel is filled with vignettes, each connected to a different type of candy, and somehow ms.liftin makes this gimmick actually work. several of the chapters had me giggling out loud--particularly when she asks why anyone would ever dip south of mentos on her mint-o-meter. she captures the bitterness of adolescence, the sourness of spoiled relationships and the spice of sheer pleasure beautifully, causing the myriad candies about which she writes to easily morph into metaphors for her life. a clever, intelligent and--yes--sweet read."
4,A slight work which still shows what this legend can do,"This is a slight novel which nonetheless shows the magic Rumer Godden, at her best, can deliver. Like many of her earlier works (Godden is still writing at the age of 90!) it mixes poetry into its prose with no effort at all, and fully capitalizes upon its exotic setting. Godden's characters are often surprising, quixotic or downright mysterious, but they never fail to engage. If you haven't already, discover this marvelous writer, and go to the library to read more (since many of her works are, very sadly, out of print.)"
2,reads like an unedited first draft,"This is the very last thing that Godden published, and it is not a well-written book.Instead of her delicate and deliberate prose, you will find repetitive and sketchy phrasing. Her wonderfully nuanced characters are missing the depth her readers expect; instead, she has left markers, as often as not, that seem to be quick notes for later revisions that never happened.The painter John Currin once said that he learned more from studying the second-rate painters than he did the masters. This book might be interesting for that reason; Godden's fine polish was never applied, and another writer might discern the armature underneath the surface.If you are reading purely for pleasure, this one won't bring the kind of joy that so very many of her works can bring. But for me, it was an illumination; even the finest of novels begin with a first draft."
1,The Pits,"If not written by Rumer Godden, this book would never have seen the light of day. The characters are shallow stereotypes left over from the Raj, and the the plot is transparent and unbelieveable."
4,interesting and informative,"You don't have to agree with everything Kaufmann writes to find the book valuable for the range of the ideas it touches on. At times, direct and humorous."
2,Not so great,"I was thrilled t purchase this for my 4 year old (I am very nostalgic.) She was initially excited, but that soon faded. It is very difficult for her to handle. The flat screen does not stay standing so she must lay it flat to insert the pegs. The peg holder is not smooth and sends pegs flying every time we opened it. We now store the pegs in a tupperware container. This is great for fine motor development, color recognition, and beginning sound identification. BUT it is sometimes so frustrating that the educational benefits are outweighed."
2,broke within 4 hours,"I bought 2 of these for my 4 and 7 year old. Both of them broke within one day. The light won't turn on at all. We replaced batteries and bulb, still doesn't work"
2,peg holder stuck,"I got this for my 6yr old. After 2 days she had worked through the pictures and has a blast. Hard to find more, stores usually out of stock. the holder at the botton was difficult to push or pull to get more pegs and by forcing it caused all the pegs to come flying out. Bad design. I have hidden this in the back of the closet to ease it's way into the trash can without detection. Certainly not worth the $$$."
2,It IS the same toy you remember,"My daughter received this toy for Christmas. I was optimistic that Hasbro had improved upon some of the Lite Brite drawbacks from years ago, but I haven't been too impressed. For starters, the ""flatscreen"" idea is cool in theory, but in practice, it doesn't stay standing; you must lay it down flat to put the pegs in, so there is constant handling. The pegs still are easily mishandled and are not failsafe once in, and the peg storage case isn't a smooth open, and pegs have gone everywhere several times. My neighbor's child received an Illumino, which is similarly priced and designed a whole lot better."
2,Use depend guards for men instead,"1) The sticky stuff on bottom isn't sticky enough to adhere very well. I phoned in this complaint to the company, it makes using this product more difficult than it should be.2) It is notably less absorbant than depend ""guards for men"". Recommend the latter over this product. It is easier to use, works better... I use it with depend super/medium pull up undergarment.This learned from years of practice with this product and guards for men. I recently found a better liner product sold at longs drugs, considerably more bulky but vastly more absorbant than both. For extensive travels and long plane flights overkill is a good thing in this area."
2,A Poor Adhesive Surface Renders this Booster Pad Inferior,"I recently purchased some Serenity Tena Heavy Pads at CVS, when I ran out of Depend Boost Inserts. I found that they work much better, because the adhesive sticky surface actually holds the booster pad securely to the adult diaper. Depend Boost inserts separate from the diaper when the patient's adult diaper is changed in the morning. Part of this may be due to the fact that the curved shape of the Serenity Tena product is better. Now that I have located a superior alternative product, I am going to cancel my subscription to Depend Boost Inserts. The folks who manufacture Depend Booster pads need to fix the problem with the adhesive."
4,Boost pads review,"Just want to say that these make my life entirely easier, and I don't want to live without them."
2,Depend Boost Inserts,"Dern. We were disappointed with this product. The adhesive is weak when dry and fairly worthless when wet. Its one weak adhesive stripe's position is poorly thought out. The absorbency is poor to fair. This is true whether used in cloth briefs or as 'back up' in a disposable brief. (A product thought up by one who had no life experience with conditions alleviated by such a product?)What we have found useful is the regular 'guards' available in any retail, and apply them as 'back up'. Great absorbency and the adhesives are serious."
2,I'm not happy with...........,"I'm not happy with The Big Box Of Art. It has screwed up my computer and it isn't that easy to use when and if you can get to it. I also have not had an easy time of getting hold of them to complain to them or find out what I can do with my computer program. It won't let me uninstall it and it has a ""fatal error"" and won't let me do anything else. Also, it has fouled up several other programs and the way they work."
1,Not as advertised,This product was completely worthless to me because it did NOT include the code from the original box. The box was not sent to me - just the disks in cases. I have written to the person who sold this to me and asked for the code or a refund.
4,Big Box of good stuff,"I eagerly awaited for this release knowing that Hemera Tech's Photo-Objects were of very high quality. And since this product contains not just photo-objects but also high quality photos, raster images, web graphics, and photofont maker, i decided it is a must.But it is not all that good. it has its hits and misses. The photos are good and of high quality but the web graphics and the raster images are a dud. What was disappointing was that the photo-objects all came from previous editions of Hemera's photo objects. So it's no use if you already have any of those photo-object editions.I think they could have come up with a more decent product."
3,Many Images of Medium Quality Poor Software,"There are, admittedly, many images. There are a bunch of cds that come with this. It will depend on what exactly you need the images for as to whether this package is good for you.There are lots of images, yes. But most I would never use. The quality of most of the images is only okay. Most of the clipart is cartoonish. The ones that are not, I never really liked for one reason or another. Poor quality, strange looking or unrealistic looking people.My use is for desktop publishing. If that is your use, I would avoid it. On the other hand, if you are merely looking for webgraphics for an unprofessional website, this might be good for you. Especially if you are willing to have a more cartoonish look to your site.Finally, I have had numerous crashes using this software. Almost everytime I have used this software for more than 15 minutes, my computer crashes and I have to reboot. I think it is a major memory hog. So beware if you have low ram."
3,Big Box Contains Lotsa Free Clip Art,"The clip art is organized very nicely and despite having to switch disks, it works just fine. I was disappointed to see that so much of the Big Box Art contained the free clip art already available on the Microsoft Design Gallery Live: ... There are other fine designs there, but for the price, I was hoping for clip art I can't already get for free."
5,Retiree,"These Stickers are fantastic. They show shells that are gorgeous, some I'm not even sure are still available. I know all the kids on my list will love them."
5,"Author is genuinely interested in students, education issues","I am a classmate and friend of the author at YLS and would like to refute the earlier character-attacking review from the YLS student. While I have not had the opportunity to read through the entire book myself, I have talked with the author about education issues and his book, and have found him to be highly informed. More importantly, I feel that he has a legitimate desire to improve the plight of those children from disadvantaged backgrounds through education reform."
5,Exactly what every student teacher should read,"I read this book after an urban student teaching experience, and I think that has the ability to really open a prospective-teacher's eyes to what they are about to face. Johnston provides the reader with a realistic account of urban education and how a first year teacher deals with the milestones of adolescence."
2,A bit too patronizing,"Tear-jerking and heartstring-tugging are well and good, but I found the writing to be melodramatic and even maudlin at many points. Besides, how can someone who jumps into two years of teaching in a place he probably would have known nothing about prior to landing there really, truly, genuinely come to understand the profound cultural riches (and poverties) of that place? It would take decades, perhaps, and the intimate understanding of a native son/daughter. I am skeptical. This felt--at least on some level--like the author is capitalizing on his experiences in the Delta. It's clear they had an impact on him, but I'm not sure they really allowed him to leave behind a subtle, smarter-than-thou attitude. Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it might awaken some readers to the horrific plight faced by American public schools."
1,Experience but not Expertise,"Johnston had a life-altering experience in the Mississippi Delta and was eager to share it. He witnessed some of the staggering problems in our educational system. But instead of being moved and challenged by his book, I grew increasingly irritated and unimpressed. How could a Yale graduate, English teacher and Grove Press author achieve publication of a work so riddled with grammatical and word usage errors? The mistakes cast doubt on Johnston's credibility as an educator and reporter. Just two examples: the repeated use of ""disinterested"" to mean ""uninterested""; and the dozens of incorrect modifiers, such as, ""Watching Corelle shuffle down the hall flanked by two security guards, a discomfort welled inside me."" Like others, I too found his tone a bit self-congratulatory. Despite all, I'm glad I read the book. It covers a part of our culture one needs to know."
3,in the deep heart's core,"this review is not about this book, its about the long wait to get it. i needed this book for my education class, but the book never came... if there was a way to get my money back for bad service, i would like to find this out and do it. thanks for screwing up my college grades Amazon."
5,Going's Novel Rules the World,"The book hooked me. Somehow, I came to care deeply about a punker drug addict and an obese(...). Even the more minor characters-- a football jock with an attitude and a gung ho marine dad-- were drawn so well that they totally grew on me. The author's great descriptions made me feel a part of their punk-rock world. I kept turning the pages to see how things would turn out for these characters I grew so fond of, and read the entire book in 2 days. A terrific debut novel. I can't wait for Going's next one."
4,"Great book, really, but too much language.","I loved this book to no end, but the language words...you'd think K.L. would've been able to convey her message without those words! Now I know this was her first novel, and that this is a YA book, but I'm sure not EVERY young adult (or any age, for that matter) thinks language is cool, and I think she could've thought harder on word choices. I would NOT recommened this book for anyone who is easily offended, and I would NOT recommened this for anyone who follows religious teachings that involve God. I know I'm harping on the language in the book, but I just want to let you know how I feel. Oh, and by the way, think before you read."
4,Fat Kid Rules the World,"""Would it be funny if the Fat Kid got splattered by a subway train?"" Those are the thoughts of Troy Billings, a depressed, suicidal, overweight teen who meets Curt McRae, a homeless teen who lives in the New York subway when he's not performing in underground music concerts. Troy become Curt's drummer, where they go onto change their lives and the music world altogether.My favorite is when Troy's dad, an ex-marine, smuggles Curt out of the hospital so that he can get to the show he's supposed to be performing in.The message of this book is that everyone has their own place in the world that will make them feel like they have a purpose in life.This is a book is a good book. It really showed the influence music can have on people. It's also nice that you don't need any prior understanding to get it. Because of that, this book is good for all audiences."
4,Fat Kid Rocked my World,"True words for any musician. I look out at the people, sitting or standing or whatever they're doing out there. I have to play. If I play the guitar, I fail. If I play the song, I fail with style.True images from the life of anyone living with the harsh burden that is overeating. Ever since, I've wanted to watch people eat. You were correct. I almost cried in a diner, watching people eat. It is discusting, but we still have to do it. Eat, become like Troy. Dont eat, become like Curt."
3,Fat Kid Rules,"This book, an adventure of sorts, in which an overweight high schooler is befriended by a cool, punk rock homeless kid, is filled with great energetic passages, thumping with strong language and believable emotional moments. It is appropriate for anyone who's ever felt a little different (and who among us hasn't?). I really enjoyed Going's writing, especially the dialog which, unlike so many YA books you read, didn't have that precious, I'm too smart to really be a kid voice. It had a great balance of reality, emotion, and strong storytelling. Fat Kid rules!"
5,Awesome book!,"I thought that this book was really good. It kept me wanting to read more even though i hate reading. The author uses a little too much harsh language than i really need. Yeah, im a kid but i still think too much of that gets really annoying. I bought this book last night for summer reading and read it for a while then finished it this morning! Really good book."
5,Thin Author Rules!!,"This is a great story. I picked it up after meeting Ms. Going who ironically is a petite individual. That may be why I picked it up, but the story was why I kept reading. It was one of the most irrestible, I-want-to-keep-reading books that I've read in a long time. The language is occasionally foul, though accurate for the characters (I only mention for readers who don't want books with any four-letter words).Short, funny chapters make you keep wanting to read just one more, and just one more. I just want to know when Going is going to write another book (no pun intended)!!"
4,Fat Kid Rules the World,"All I can say is... interesting. So you have Troy, a fat kid who is suicidal. And then you have Curt, a skinny homeless kid who is an awesome rocker. Troy envies Curt and his rocking abilities, and is stunned when Curt invites him to be his drummer.This book was cool. I've never read a book from a fat person's point of veiw (I don't think so at least) and I really enjoyed it."
2,Fat Kid Rules the World,I had problems with the cussing in this book. I found it slow paced and while the story was realistic this book is not for everyone. It has a slow start and I had to force myself to keep going. I found I could skip pages and do just as well as if I had read it straight through. While some may enjoy this book for the postive message I would be careful what ages read this book.
1,Fat Kid Rules the World,PARENTS BEWARE!I am digustd with this book. I would urge all parents to read this book before they let their children. This book is in my childs junior high school. I am working to get it removed. The language is the most horrible I have ever read. I am about 1/2 way through the book. The fowl language starts on page 3 and is on almost every page I have read so far. While this book may be a story young people like to read I think it would have been just as effective without the fowl language. Most adults would never approve of their children using this type of language so I don't feel it's okay for kids (junior high)to read this.
5,Far kid rules,Fat kid rules the world was a great easy read!!! I love reading books that are easy to picture and this book does that. I was very happy to learn it was made into a movie and read it before I saw it. You can see the movie too by going to [...]
4,Solid adolescent lit,"I found the main characters believable, though not as complexly developed as I would have liked. The book moves slowly at the start, making me wonder if it had much substance to it. Half way through, though, it picks up the pace and the inevitable conflict between the two new best friends brings in the necessary tension. The plot arch is a little predictable for adult readers, but I think it's solid for adolescent readers. I think the ending redeems some of this for the adult readers, though may leave the adolescent readers wanting more. Overall, a solid teen book and highly recommended for reluctant boy readers. It has profanity and drug use, so I'd wait until at least middle school for it."
4,Great story elements,"I would rate Fat Kid Rules the World about and 8 out of 10. I rate it this because it was a great story line and great story elements, however it seemed like every chapter started out the same way. I would say it is appropriate for kids about our age (9th grade) and up because of it's language and references."
4,Times of Yesteryears,I grew up with this comic strips by Walt Disney. It was refreshing to see them again and allow my grandchildren to be exposwed to a more sane structure than the ones that they are exposed in todays world.
2,Product is not very good,"I got this product for my 5 year old, and it is about right,any 3-6th grade would not like it at all. The best thing in the game is the free cluefinders monkey adventure in my costco box.Most of the games look like they were designed for windows 95.I liked the clips from grammar rock, I remember these as a kid, but you could by the DVD of Schoolhouse rock and get better versions of those."
2,"Good theme, low quality software","The goal behind this software is great. We bought this to give our computer savvy child some practice on writing and language art. The software is not of good quality. It has hard to use user interface. Especially compared to other educational software, this lacks the finish. My son soon got bored and has never used this."
5,Great Product - Have used it for over 3 years,Litter Locker Plus has created a product that works in today's busy life. It retains the order within. The only thing that I hope that they will do more research as to how fast the waste biodegrades the plastic bag more quickly to make the product green beneficial.
5,"This litter bag cartridge no waste, no smell","I have used the Litter Locker Plus for several years and it is wonderful. Keeps the smell down to nothing and the cartridges are very good. I have only broken 1 bag and it was my fault in the last 13 refills(I buy 5 at a time and usually each cartridge lasts for more than 3 months with 2 small cats - cornish rex)!! I no longer follow their instructions (haven't for years). The locker keeps smell to nothing so no need to thread the bags thru the slots and turn the wheel, etc. Just knot the end of the new bag and pull out enough to almost reach the bottom straight down. As it fills it will pull down the rest needed and you don't waste any of the plastic bag which is made from sturdy plastic. Each bag holds around 10 lbs dirty when done my way and each cartridge lasts for 3-4 months with 2 small cats. No odor, no tears - what more could you want? It is economical."
5,Litter Locker Refills,We have a multi-cat household but you cannot tell a single cat lives here when you walk in the door. The Litter Locker seals any odor and the refills last a couple of weeks for us. Can't imagine our 'litter pan room' without it! The company was also great and provided prompt service.
4,Great product. End the cat litter mess for good!,We purchased the Litter Locker and LOVE it! Makes clean up a breeze without having to walk outside to the trash 3 times a day! We have 2 cats and we found this product to be a life saver! I've even got my parents to get one and they LOVE it too! You can't go wrong with this product!
5,Absolutely wonderful,These work so well in the litter locker. It has changed our daily life when cleaning out the litter box. It use to be such a hassle and smelled something awful but with these you can't smell a thing and it holds a lot. One of these usually lasts us around two months. Well worth the money you will not regret this purchase!
5,Great Price,I bought these in a store before and they were more expensive. I like the litter container. It keeps smells to a minimum and they are easy to tie up and throw away without the mess of other bags.
5,Litter Locker refills,I have four cats and the Litter Locker works great! There is no odor at all. The refills are expensive at the pet stores so ordering the 5 pack saved me a lot of money. Well worth it.
1,litter locker refillsl,"We purchased 5 litter locker refills, two were defective, liner was cut almost from one end to the other. One in use is OK and two more suspects.Probably won't buy again from this outfit."
5,A must for multiple cat households,"The Litter Locker Plus is a nice solution for cat owners, especially for those with more than one feline in the house. This retailer has been selling the refills for a better price than others I've seen, and shipments have been on time (or even early)."
2,New Refill Cartridge Doesn't Last as Long,"I've been using the Litter Locker for over 6 years. It is a good product that eliminates odors. Unfortunately, there appears to be a manufacturing issue with the recent batch of refills. The refill cartridge used to last well over 30 days as advertised, however, lately it is only lasting 10 - 14 days. The 5 pack used to last me about 5 months. I purchased a 5 pack in late May that only lasted about 1.5 months. Not sure whether other consumers have noticed the same thing? I contacted PetMate but was informed that they no longer manufacture the refills. I think the refills are now manufactured in Canada. I hope this is not a ploy to increase profits by reducing the cartridge capacity."
4,Great bargain for a reliable and sometimes hard to find item.,"I love being able to purchase these in a multipak. The cost savings is significant as well, since they run about $10 plus tax where I live. I experienced prompt delivery and found the product to be the same as in the stores. This stuff has dealt with the smell and pain of clean up much better than I anticipated.My only complaint is that sometimes it is hard to tell when the bag is running out and you turn it, only to realize later that the top came down and some spilled in the container.The only way I would stop using this is if I could toilet train my cat, and he is pretty resistant to that notion."
5,Great Product,These refills are great. My house never smells like my cat's litter box and they make clean-up easy.
4,Long time user,These litter locker refills work okay. The only problem I have had is finding the end when I start a new pack. This can be frustrating and costly if I have to use them double because of not getting the end when started.
5,Best product for scooping litter box,"The litter locker, jr and the refills for it, make scooping the litterbox easy and hassle free. If you don't have one you NEED one."
1,Cheap imitation,"This item does not hold the odor as well as the original cartridge that came with the litter lock unit I purchased at Petsmart. I bought this 5 pack unit to save money, but since it does not contain the odor it has been a waste of money. If this is indeed a legitiment item from litter locker, then they must have reduced the thickness of the plastic, which is causing the odors to escape."
3,Litter Locker Refills,"Picture appears to be authenticate product but is not when received. Is a cheaper knock off and can have problems with the plastic spooling off. 3 out of 5 cartridges after removing the plastic ring for use have a problem with releasing the plastic. I've had to literally break the permanent top ring to get it started. It seems when it's manufactured the plastic ring is adhered to the product and the bags cannot release. If you don't mind fighting with these a bit, it's cheaper than buying in the store."
2,"the distributor is great, the product not so good","The company I purchased this from was great, they were very quick with shipping. The problem is the plastic is to thin and everytime I go to empty my litter locker, there is a tear somewhere in the plastic. Which of coarse make a mess everywhere, and takes extra time to clean and disinfect the area. I have one cat and clean out the litter locker once a week. Product doesn't seem tough enough for the job."
1,Dissatisfied customer,"I have yet to receive this product that the company said I received. It never showed up at my doorstep despite the fact the company says it was delivered. I do not know where they delivered it. The company has not responded to my requests other than saying this will be investigated. But it has been a month since they said I received it, and I still have no product that has been paid for. Please beware when purchasing with this company. They do not require signatures for acceptance of delivery and apparently don't care which address they use to deliver their products as long as it get off their trucks. Totally dissatisfied with this service. /Margaret"
5,litter locker rocks!,We have 3 cats and litter locker is a huge help in keeping down oder and mess. This is the best price I have seen on refill cartridges. Shipping was super fast. Great service!Thanks!
4,Price is right!,What a great deal! Even after shipping costs we saved about $20. This is the second time we bought this product. Must admit being nervous the first time but the quality was as good as the store bought. Received it pretty quickly as well.
2,Not really satisfied,"The first refill cartridge that was put into the litter locker ripped twice, sending dirty litter into the unit, which I then had to remove, clean out and then re-install. I have just put in the second refill cartridge, so I do not know how that one will work, but if I have any trouble with this second one, I will not re-order."
5,Litter Locker Cartridge,Product received is as advertised. Price is better than in the local stores. Received order in a short period of time.
5,litter locker refills,I could no longer find these in the local pet stores but you provided them to me quickly and at a price that was very competitive to what I was spending.Thank you
1,This product is NOT as advertised - Beware,Upon receiving this product I found that it didn't appear to be long enough. The product as received was new and sealed. When measured I found it to be only 91 feet long and not the advertised 100 feet. I also noticed that it didn't seem as heavy as 10 gauge wire I have used in the past so I got out my precision wire gauge and found that this wire was significantly smaller that 10 gauge and appeared to be closer to 12 gauge even though it was labeled 10 gauge right on the wire. I feel that this product is totally misrepresented and therefore cannot recommend it.
1,Not 10 gage,"I measured this wire using dial calipers and it measures about 0.080"" or 12 gage. Clearly misrepresented. 10 gage measures .108"" on the competitors wire. Don't buy this unless you want 12 ga and it's cheap! Python 2 is great speaker wire!"
3,Good Price but Shorter Than As Advertised,"The product is came with one side in copper color and the other side in silver color. I am not sure if the silver side is real Copper or Aluminum. As others stated in their review, the product I order was only 90 feet instead of 100. I am a little supsious that this wire is slightly less that 10 guage since I couldn't cut through it with 10 guage cut. However, The price is good and I am ok with it even though the guage may be slightly smaller. Most of the home user stereo and home theater system should be enough with this wire. 10 guage is over-killed. In fact, you can't tell the difference between 14 gauge and 10 guage if the length of the wire is less than 50 feet. Therefore I don't see the recent to pay 3x more for the monster cable. [...]."
2,raptor,"Decent strand count, but the ground wire is not copper as it appears in the product description, and the photo, only the positive speaker wire is copper. Buyer beware!!!"
1,Watch out for backordering,The company makes it seem like they have the stuff and then they dont..charge your card for the product that they dont even have... watch out for this total b.s.
1,not as shown,I have received speaker wire and was surprised that it was not what I saw on the picture here. The wire is copper and silver color. I was told that it is just color. I hope so.
4,It is what it is,This is solid speaker wire. The fool who writes that it's 9 feet short and gives it one star are the kind of people who ruin what would be normal ratings.
5,The Perfect Bathroom Book!,"Really! Each essay is one to two pages of delightful, insightful look into the minds of the New Yorker from the 1920s to 2000. Yes, the essays are humorous, but even more entertaining was looking at what the world was like 'then'. It really is like glimpsing a piece of cultural history. That each essay is so short means that it's perfect for sampling when you have only a few minutes to spare."
3,Ego,"Ross, a capable but often pedestrian reporter and writer (her quirks and tics quickly grow tiresome), has overstuffed the book with specimens of her own ""Talk"" pieces. Much more talented ""Talk"" writers are woefully unrepresented here."
4,As Time Goes By - Complete Series 3 - used copy,"As Time Goes By - Complete Series 3I purchased a used copy frm an Amazon vendor and played it through. The DVD arrived when scheduled with a few scratches and smudges on it, and the case was somewhat worn. It played well, and we enjoyed the good clean British comedy entertainment for which Judi Dench is famous. And I really enjoyed receiving it at a very attractive (used) discount from what buying it new would have been."
1,As Time Goes By - Complete Series 3,"While I absolutely love the show on PBS, this season was mispackaged. The box and DVD were both labeled series 3, but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1/2. Unfortunately, I didn't try watching this disc until several months after I bought it. If you buy this, be sure you view it promptly to be certain it's the correct series."
5,A short story from GB worth its' weight and hours of repeatrf veiwing,This is a series that we have enjoyed on PBS and decided we wanted to continue to enjoy it on the evenings it is preempted and after is has run it's course as a program. You could count on one hand the number of dvds we have purchased for our own entertainment but this series is so outstanding we decided we had to have it. Charming and innovative dialogue well presented by the cast of stars with whom one quickly falls in love.
5,As Time Goes By 3,"For full disclosure I must tell you that I am a Judi Dench fan. I enjoyed her in ""Four in the Morning"", ""Macbeth"", and ""Shakespeare in Love"" just to name a few. As far as I am concerned, she is the most accomplished dramatic actress of the twentieth century. Having said that, it is not dramatic acting that is her strongest point: comedy is, and ""As Time Goes By"" is the apex of her comedic career. She and Jeffery Palmer ""jell"", and the rest of the cast are outstanding as well. This is a light comedy series that keeps the audience laughing and, although a significant part of the plot involves Jean and Lionel ""living together"", it is so well done that the whole family can enjoy it. That is the reason it has so many episodes; it ran for nine series, 1991 to 2002."
4,excellent with reservations,"I bought this with great anticipation, the series is excellent and I was looking forward to having it all on DVD. To begin with it isn't all of the series, the last two segments are missing. I also received 2 of the series one and two and none of series 3 and had to order that seperately. I do realize it wasn't Amazon's fault that the packing of the series was faulty but If a series is described as complete It really should be complete. Complete means everything not everything except some of it. I have had to seperately order the last two segments. Somewhat annoying. Amazon should make clear what is being offered for sale."
5,TGB Season 3,"Great series. I recommend it to everyone with a heart! (Ten more words are required to make this ""submittable, so here they are.)"
5,Calphalon does it again!,Many of my cooking ware is Calphalon and All-Clad. This is such a great product to boil and steam foods. The collander baskets do you a great service of draining the water or keeping the water away from your steamed foods. Be careful not to let the lid get wet and create a seal around the rim of the pot. The steam won't escape and could cause a build-up of pressure inside that can be dangerous.
4,Great pot,"This has both a steamer and a pasta strainer, the capacity of the pasta strainer seems plenty for me, are some reviewers confused about using the steamer to cook pasta? That indeed would be too small for a decent amount of pasta."
2,Some good but more bad points,"We love the look and feel of the pot and the price seemed great. However, we also had lid issues. We did not use an excess of liquid, as we were just steaming fish. The condensation built up on the lid and dripped out the side the entire time it was steaming. An annoying mess."
1,Minimum utitlity maximum bulk,"The bottom's too thick to quickly boil water....a definite shortcoming in a pasta pot...and the top's too loose to use it as a dutch oven. It will probably be useful for slow simmering a sauce. Fortunately, the strainer inserts fit a an old pasta pot of mine. I figure that buying the inserts would have cost me [more], so maybe I'll forgive its shortcomings and keep it. Only the ... price (...) makes it buyable."
4,Nice product,This is a useful combination of steamer and pasta pot. My only complaint is that the diameter and depth of the main pot should be increased. With the present dimensions one can only cook one pound of pasta at a time and have an adequate volume of water when the pasta insert is being used. It's great for steaming vegetables.
4,Great pot for price,"It's a bit on the heavy side, but perfectly managable. The inserts function as they are suppose to; a bit short, but overall they're great for steaming. The lid fits fine and if you're just using the pot by itself, any standard 10in lid seems to work.Great for the price!"
4,Beautiful kitchen piece,"We use this pot for making stock, steaming things and other various necessities. I don't use the pasta insert for pasta because of the inordinate amount of time that much water takes to boil, but I use the insert when I'm making stock. It's so much easier to put all the stuff in there and then lift the insert out when you're done. No more awkward pouring through a strainer while trying not to get burned and/or drop the pot! The steamer insert is the perfect size for two ears of corn. The pot is also very pretty with nice clean lines."
3,steamer handles dangerous,"I was so disappointed to see the thin wobbly handles on the steamer insert. I thought they would be substantial like those pictured on the box for the pasta insert. The handles have fallen off twice, one has gone down the garbage disposal (rescued) and they get in the way when you are putting vegetables in the steamer. Also, the glass lid should have a hole to let steam escaape. otherwise it is good.Geraldine"
4,Does the job well--with a couple of quirks,"I was looking for a pasta and steamer insert. I came across this all-in-one set and it was cheaper than the pasta insert. With the Calphalon name how bad could it be? Overall I'm pleased with it. It's much heavier than I expected, and does it's job perfectly, for me. The drawbacks, as mentioned in other reviews, are the handles on the steamer--it's hard to keep them out of the food, and the large quantity of water required to use the pasta insert."
4,Outstanding Value for the Money,"I bought this set on sale. This is very good quality cookware for the price I paid. I doubt I would have paid full price for it, though."
3,Good pots BUT ...,"After about a month's use, we had a major disaster with this pot. After the contents reached boiling, we turned the flame down, as the recipe said. The glass lid fit so tightly that it formed a partial vacuum, and as the pressure inside dropped, suddenly the lid shattered into zillions of tiny pieces. It totally ruined the food, of course, as well as destroying the lid.We did find a lid from another pot that we had that fit, so we use that. Otherwise it's a pretty good pot. We use the small basket a lot for steaming. The larger basket, as others have suggested, isn't very good for making pasta, but it works to just use the pot, and use the large basket as a strainer.After a few years, the pots still look quite good.But I'd suggest that you file a few grooves in the edge of the lid, to prevent an airtight seal. If you don't, you may end up with a shattered lid as we did."
2,Beautiful ...BUT,"...pasta insert only reaches down about 60% into the pot so you have to put about 4 quarts of water in before it even touches the insert...which means to do any kind of volume you are practically filling pot to brim which is both time consuming (to boil)and heavy to deal with once ready (to move/drain). Similarly, because of this design tragedy, you can't really cook much more pasta than what could have been accommodated in a properly designed 6 quart pot/insert, so you don't even get to benfit from the size....all around shame ! (Just a pretty stock pot now)...and I haven't even used the lid yet to experience all these other horrors I am reading about.Calphalon should have recalled/replaced or Amazon should have accepted a little more responsibility for peddling it once issues were brought to light.JMHO..."
2,The Huge Disappointment,"Calphalon Collector's Edition Stainless Steel 4-Piece Multi-Pot Set is a huge disappointment. The lid fits improperly therefore the spatters aren't contained and the lid rattles. In fact, the spatters are so frequent that you can't leave this pot unattended. I feel strongly that a quality replacement pot/lid is due from the manufacturer. This is an expensive pot to have such a serious defect. I will not recommend this product to anyone."
2,What a mess!,"Well, I thought what a deal at this price. It turned out to be a big messy disappointment.It does not matter if you use the large insert or the smaller steam insert or both together ---- If you are steaming anything or boiling anything you are going to have a mess all over your stove. The glass lid sits atop the insert(s) in such a manner that there is no way for any condensation to escape OR drain back into the pot. What you end up with is a lid that dances around while large amounts of water spit and splatter all over the sides. I have a smooth top range and this is the pits as the water gets all over the burner.If I could return it after two months I surely would. If I had known of these problems I would have never purchased this..... at any cost!..."
1,The Pot that Couldn't be Saved,"Unfortunately my order of the Calphalon Pot did not work out so well... The first shipment included a damaged lid.... after returning that set and receiving another, it also included a damaged lid. Your decision was to cancel the order. I was disappointed in that I needed this type of pot and I thought it was a good price. Perhaps that was the problem! In any case, I appreciate the promptness and ease of returning the item. Just wish you could have found an undamaged pot. Thanks anyway...."
3,Only mediocre,"This pot is mediocre. There are two problems that I would not expect in what is named as part of Calphalon's higher-priced line:-the stainless steel discolors much more easily than the other piece of Calphalon I own, a triply line frying pan that I'm happy with, and seems harder to get clean even with elbow grease and vinegar-perhaps because there's only an aluminum base or perhaps because the aluminum is less than high quality, it took 15-20 minutes to boil 4 qts of water on an electric range on the middle setting (and the instructions recommend not going higher)On the plus side, the glass lid actually fits my 10"" Triply frying pan quite nicely.If you want a pot for pasta, look elsewhere."
3,"Nice looking, slow working","The picture and verbal description describe a very functional pot for a pasta-loving family. Problem is that it takes a good twenty minutes to reach the needed boiling point (we called the manufacturer and the phone representative admitted, yes, it takes a long time) and the slip-in collander is more cumbersome than convenient. We don't use it. The smaller steamer is useful but gets less use.The pot is a good size, easy to clean (most pots that boil water are), and looks nice."
2,Not for the bachelor,This is my first pasta cooker. I'm single and don't really need the huge capacity but I've seen them on all of the cooking shows and decided that I could use one. I was dismayed to find out I had to boil two gallons of water just to cook some pasta. The insert is way too short. Then it was those goofy wire handles on the steamer insert. You can't get anything into or out of this basket without getting tangled up in those wires. I should have read this column before buying. Next time....
2,Pasta Insert Not Deep Enough,"I read reviews of people complaining that the pasta insert was not deep enough and I still purchased this item. Big Mistake. I should have purchased a pasta insert for the Calphalon pot I already have, rather than this 4 piece Multi-pot.If you already have a pot this size, I'd purchase a pasta insert which is much deeper than the insert that comes in this set."
1,"Calphalon, But What a Desaster!","Bought this to replace my trusted 4-quart steel steamer and pasta pot after watching a certain kitchen show tout the benefits of cooking pasta in a lot more water than one thinks. Well, you can't cook more pasta in it than in my little one because the water will boil over. And because you need more water, it takes forever to come to a boil. The lid is a joke, it spits and dances on the pot, and the shallow insert is worthless - the handles keep flopping down no matter how much I tried to fix it. Since I didn't get it from Amazon (I know better now!), and used it a few times, I can't return it anymore. It went back into the box and in the basement to languish until the next charity sale. So, the little guy still gets lots of use, and I have much better stockpots, an older 6-quart non-stick from Calphalon and a 8-quart stainless steel from Jamie Oliver/T-fal! Chalk it up to experience, sigh."
2,"Pot is nice, the rest is not very useful","Well, we love the pot, mostly because we love stainless steel pots from an easy cleaning perspective. However, there's some problems with the rest of the items in the multipot. For starters, the lid is horrible. It doesn't quite fit the pot itself and it has no dip in the design before the side. What this means is that when something is boiling it sputters and sprays water out the top all over your stove. Cooking chili? Plan to get tomato juice sprayed around your cook top. You'll need a new lid. Second, the insert for pasta doesn't reach the bottom of the pot, not even close, probably 2 to 3 inches separates the sieve from the pot bottom. This means you're boiling about 6-8 cups more water than you need to every time you want to make pasta. This two things are a big deal to me since I bought the pot to be useful and because it came with a lid. Now it's just another pot."
3,Walker Basket Problem,This basket does not fit all walkers. My walker (Invicare) has a button release for the handles in the middle of the cross piece so the basket just hangs on the front of the walker at an angle. It works but not ideally.
4,BE CAREFUL BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!,"I was challenged to a horseback sword fight last week, and I wanted to protect my favorite horse (chester) during the ordeal. Anyway, I ordered this expecting to be an actual chain-mail outfit for Chester, but what I received was a kids toy! I ended up buying 300 more, and took apart the small 2x2"" chain mail pieces on the toy, and sewed them together to make an actual chain mail outfit for my horse. In the end, it functioned fairly well, but I didn't get to test it out. On the day of the event, I had forgotten it was a sword fight, and I brought a shotgun."
5,Fantastic Product!,"This is an excellent horse figure for Papo's Sir Lancelot figures, either the Blue or the Red one, though the Blue Lancelot looks best with the blue trim. This figure combination is appropriate for storytelling, playtime, or display (classroom or homeschool). [The Papp ""Mercenary"" figure will also seat on this horse fairly well.]The chain-mail appearance is very striking. The figure stands well by itself, and it gives the appearance of being in motion. The quality figure is detailed and well-painted--ready for imagination and adventure when paired with a rider. The horse is so detailed you can even see his shoes!"
4,Simple & clear review of this musical language...,"A simple,well organized and concise explanation of what constitutes a specific musical language known as Jazz....Important item to have all those interested in this musical style"
4,VT HANDS FREE,Really satisfied with this product. This was for my wife's car since I already had one in my car. Clarity of sound and calls are stable.
1,Useless,"Crashed constantly when I first used it on my iMac running 10.3. After a while, it refused to load at all. The update only made the problem worse, so I've had virtually no use of it and can't recommend it to anyone. Whatever is wrong with it, the Hemera people should have fixed it, but they haven't and show no interest in doing anything."
1,get Art Explosion instead,"I made the mistake of buying both this and the photo clip art images. The searching is terrible, but that's no surprise. The vector images aren't really vector, as they can only be downloaded as EPS files (for Mac). The quality of the images themselves are awful, and look like shady scan jobs. Definitely not for professional use, but barely good enough for fun use. Spend your money elsewhere, like the Art Explosion series. I love these and it comes with a huge catalog book to look up your clip art."
3,It's just okay,"The problem with this library is that if you want to see any of the vector images, you need to load each DVD to see them in preview. And the preview is so small, you often have to download the image to see what it really looks like. It takes too much time to do this. I recommend Art Explosion. It comes with a book of all the images and the files are easier to download from the discs."
4,"Genial, warm-hearted readings, like Haydn in love","Even Bruno Walter, who in old age was a softer conductor than anyone before or since, didn't dare to swathe Haydn in romantic velvet. But Beethoven's Sym. 1 and 2 gave him that opportunity. These cross-over works from the world of Haydn can be successfully played as heroic precursors (by Klemperer, Karajan and Bernstein, for example), but Walter strives to make them sunny and carefree, and his approach works.In their way, these symphonies are the ideal introduction to Walter's notions about Beethoven, but they aren't perfect. The slow movements in both works tend to dawdle, without a hint of the dance. He smothers the joke leading into the finale of Sym. 1 and fails to make the finale of Sym. 2 be as fleet as it should. Even so, the Columbia Sym. sounds quite good throughout, and the recording is among the best that the engineers managed during Walter's late years in Los Angeles. To lovers of Walter's relaxed style, this CD would deserve five stars."
3,Grand son Elijah,"This was one of our Christmas gifts to our grand son Elijah who lives in Vermont. All gifts were shipped in time for the big day. He is probably at the correct age for his first harp and since both his father and uncle are huge music fans, e.g. harmonica and guitar, I'm certain he will find opportunity to play."
5,gotta have it!,i have been collecting the guiness book of records since 2001. i got mine out the other day and noticed i was missing the 2006 edition. i just about went crazy...so if ur looking for things to collect these books are great for any age...even me at age 16 =D
5,No Brainer - Buy it!,"Since the moment I first saw (and heard) this production, I have been waiting and searching the web for a DVD. The singing - every role - is fabulously performed. All of the actors are young, sexy and supremely talented. I was delighted with the minimally staged production as it keeps your eyes and ears where they belong anyway - on the singers and the music.Owning this DVD is a no brainer for opera lovers everywhere. It is a must buy!"
3,For the curious only,"The stage on this production is almost empty and brightly lighted, including in the ""In the shadows"" scene (2nd Act). It almost looks like a rehearsal in a small room intended to make the singers work on their characters as much as possible before going into the full set. Regrettably, the result is not good enough and it doesn't succeed in portraying the characters to their fullest. You have to have a very good imagination, and in essence know the scene well to capture the exchange of clothes between Leporello and Don Giovanni and the disguise that it implies. There are, though, some nice touches like Don Giovanni watching the finale after his departure to hell and suggesting he was finally touched by the people that surrounded him during his life.The musical aspects are quite good, but not to level of a WOW. I can recommend this DVD only to those curious enough to watch a new staging idea."
4,How not to remodel your home,"The easy-going lives of a family living right next to an unused motorway are thrown into turmoil when it unexpectedly opens. Their efforts to cope with the sudden noise, intrusion, and pollution become increasingly desperate as, during the heat of summer, they descend into madness. There are definite Ballardian overtones in Meier's touching movie. It's a captivating examination of how modern existence can tip even the most equanimous over the edge given the right circumstances. The performances are uniformly excellent and the script avoids melodrama, keeping its feet firmly on the ground even when the family falls apart. Captivating, thoughtful and ultimately redemptive."
1,A disappointment,"As I read the book, there was not a good flow to the book. It was hard to follow. John Eisenhower would be a disappointment to his father."
4,Reasonable Price+Quality=Value,"Product arrived on time and seemed to have a good finish. Hinge action is smooth. Of course, this is a prtty basic product and remember that is not a self-close hinge that everyone seems to want these days but I used them on a large cabinet used as a linen closet. I wanted an antique look and this fit the bill. Be sure to use 3 on a door taller than about 30-32""."
2,Auto renewal?,I bought this as a gift and was not aware of the auto renewal. I found out when i was asked to review the product. I'm sure the mag is great but I didn't want to make a lifetime gift. This feature should be better stated.
5,the BEST allergy resource book,"My son was diagnosed with 63 confirmed food allergies, 3 of which were life-threatening at even microscopic exposures. Our family's learning curve was huge. This book helped tremendously. We all enjoy a great deal more ""normal"" because we got some great advice from this book about ""managing"". The book covers all sorts of topics and I would recommend it to anyone. I would describe the book as comprehensive and then some, but also easy to read and remember. We are far better off for having used it in our lives!"
4,Informative,"I really enjoyed this book. It gave some practical tips that I would not have thought of. I am new to having a child with food allergies. Thanks goodness, so far they are not life-threatening yet. I felt that this book really gave some tools to help me if his allergies became life-threatening."
2,I dont think So!,What is going on here? they dont teach you any moves just suppose to follow alone blindly. not for me. Turbo Jam is waay better!Everyone is cheezy too.
4,AMAJOKE,"The product itself is great. The delivery time and customer service from Amazon were horrible. Listed as in stock, ship in 24 hrs and deliver in 3-5 days. DID NOT ship for 7 DAYS or 168 hours with an estimated delivery of 9-13 days. Finally arrived 13 days after ordering."
4,Incredible Children's Artist's Compendium of Stories,"Tibor Gergely illustrated most of Western Publishing's most popular ""Little Golden Books"" stories during the 1940s through the 1960s. Mostly sold as single story books, usually sold for less than a dollar each. The Seven Little Postman, Tootle, The Little Caboose, Five Little Firemen, Scuffy the Tugboat, and others that introduced children to character-building lessons while presenting storylines populated with talking animals and machines. I loved reading it to my children and enjoyed the stories as well as I did when I was a young boy. They are all assembled here in one place for you and your children to enjoy."
3,good read but fundamentally a procedure about the ordinary,"Ed McBain always delivers a good read - but the Matthew Hope character, for me, is fundamentally uninteresting.I've only read this book in the series but it feels like a procedural about the ordinary notwithstanding the triple murder. I have been a McBain fan for years and the time isn't wasted but, in my view, ""Goldilocks"" isn't close to ""Talking To The Dead""."
3,The other woman,"This book started out the Matthew Hope series. My mom recommended this series to me because we tend to like the same style writing and she raves about Ed Mcbain. This book was ok. It was about two different situations tied together in which both men were cheating on their spouses. It had a couple surprises here and there. It was a pretty quick read and I am hoping the second book is a little more interesting. I still liked the story it just didn't have that ""thing"" about it."
3,Goldilocks,"The book was o.k. but not great. It might appeal to someone else more. Yes, I would recommend it , it might more someone else's style."
2,Anticlimactic,I am a longtime ed mcbain fan but this book was just terrible - could've been something great but instead boiled down to a whimper in the end. I found myself wondering if it was over and flinging it aside in exasperation.
4,Early Hope,"If you are lucky enough to find a copy of this read it. Much better than the usual Matthew Hope stuff. The characters feel tremendous pain, including Hope, and McBain is good enough to transmit it without ever being ""novelistic"" about it. Up to the best of the 87th precinct stuff."
3,Knifty models confusingly presented,"That rating is really 3 1/2 stars, because the book is better than just average. It may look slim, but it's chock-full of several models in each of many families of modules. Not hours, but weeks of fun (not to mention a lot of paper squares).The problem is the presentation. Many models are hard to follow, especially when trying to put them together; more than once, I had to refer to another book to figure out what to do. Some diagrams are confusing, if not outright wrong (3-dimensional pictures are especially prone to this). Occasionally instructions are alluded to (e.g., in captions) that aren't there. There's a complete absence of cross-references between illustrative photos and instructions for folding them.In short, a frustrating book. If the good parts weren't so good, it wouldn't be quite so frustrating."
1,Origami book,I was really disapointed over this book. The drawings was to unclear and difficult to understand. And I am very sorry that I am not able to use this book.
1,not worth my time,"terrible book, it was honeslty such a waste of time, this author is obviously too set on his way of seeing things, very narrow mindedly, i do not suggest you wasting your time on this unless you enjoy right-winging torture, but that's just my opinion"
2,Shallowness abounds,"The book is page after page of banalities. It's not well-written, and it's not particularly original. It is, however, useful in one way: Ramos' attitudes about Latino integration *might* fairly reflect the views of many in designated Hispanic leadership. And, somewhat disturbingly, his view is virtually identical to Sam Huntington's: namely, that Hispanics are resistant to learning English and assuming an American identity. True, Ramos *celebrates* this premise, but it would be roundly denounced if it came from a non-Hispanic.Unlike the Buchanan's of the world, I have no doubt in the power of the American experience to integrate people of all skin colors and national origins. But newcomers must *want* to become Americans. And Ramos suggests that (at least) many Latinos don't."
5,Joyriver - Peaceful and Calm,Karla Scott has done a wonder job capturing the essence of quiet time in the presence of the Lord God. This is a must have. Her vocal skill coupled with the anointing of God makes for a wonderful experience. Definitely!!
3,Synopsis,"From the back of the book:MR. MARCHName: TannerKind of Man: A proud, elusive loner who, like the Great Snowy Owl he rescued, prized his freedom above all else.His Undoing: A woman named Charly.--------------------------------Carson Tanner lived his life closer to the edge than any sane man should. Then he met Charly Erickson, who bred horses in springtime and orchids in winter--and who seduced him with her sweet femininity. Suddenly, freedom had never seemed lonelier.But what could Tanner offer her? His world was a dark, dangerous place--where the hunter could become the hunted, and where the long night had no end...."
2,Alright,"It's okay but all in all a boring book, goes in depth about the wrong topics and just gets you lost easlily"
3,An Okay Grammar Book,"While this book is good to go through if you have the time, it's not good as a reference book. Use it only if you want an in-depth grammar textbook. I do have to say though, even as a textbook, there were times that I wished it was more like a dictionary (a dictionary that would use words I knew if I was a new-to-grammar person)."
4,Super cute and super small!,"Im glad I heeded everyone's advice and sized up! Im a size 5 in dresses and according to the Rip Curl sizing chart I am a 6 or 8 so I went with a 10 and it fits...but if I gain a pound there is no way I'm getting this thing on! So definitely go up a size (or two maybe). Once I squeeze into it though its a really get snug fit that doesnt restrict movement like I thought it might. Also the design is really cute and the picture doesnt quite do it justice because on the black one, the stitching is baby pink not white."
1,Doesn't work in any sense -- except smell -- stinks!,"If you take compentent studio musicians, you can make an album with the sound of metal, but listeners will see right through it.Clearly, there is no emotional experience available here. Better to have taken less-capable musicians who have at least listened to Beatles music. Reading sheet music differs from feeling the grove this CD is a good example of that prinicple.No sale."
3,Cute print but not as soft as I hoped,"Darling little printed sheets and comforter which look great, but they were not as soft and snuggly as I expected them to be for the price. I feel like I could have gone to Target and spent $30 to get something very similar. Softness has improved a bit after some washings but colors have already faded a bit too."
4,Why I rated this book with 4 stars...,"If you're looking for more serious information and training for SAR dogs these is a GREAT book. It's clear, well written with serious information on what a SAR dog AND handler must be like. It takes you from step 1 (choosing a puppy) to having a full operational SAR dog (radio communication, handler's, training step by step, etc).So, why 4 stars and not 5? This book isn't very open to different techniques, methods, dogs or info from around the world. For wood search it's very good. If you want info on avalanche or disaster search it's not very complete."
4,"Very Informative, a good bginning resource.",This book was very informative resource. It provide a starting point but should be used in conjunction with practical help from others already involved. The book is well written and easy to read. Worth money and time to read.
4,"A compilation of three excellent, bizarre novels","This is a compilation of three of Cherryh's older and stranger books. Port Eternity is Arthurian in space, but is much better than that would normally imply. Wave without a Shore is philosophical, concept-driven SF which reminds me somewhat of LeGuin in a similar mode, though perhaps less self-righteous. I enjoyed it a great deal but readers who are put off by heavy philosophy may be bored. Voyager in Night is the weirdest of the bunch -- it reminds me of an SRL video. It's nominally an Alliance/Union story about a ship which gets kidnapped by an unknown alien; it's also about identity both personal and species. Overall, this is a compilation which makes sense and I'd highly recommend it."
4,stimulating,"These books really caught me off guard. I've been a fan of CJ for many years and I find her to be one of the best, but these books really made me think. This is a must read for anyone of intellegence."
3,Not what I expected,"These short novels are okay, a bit of a hard slog, but they're just not at all what I expected from the title. I love reading about alternate history, set in our world with some single change being worked out. Thisis not that at all, but simply three relatively far out SF novels. Badlymisnamed, imho."
2,"Oh, well.","Slogged through ""Port Eternity""; gave ""Voyager in Night"" a run but didn't care enough to finish it; couldn't even get into ""Wave Without a Shore"". As ever, the stories are well written -- Cherryh knows her craft -- but I find that there's no middle ground for me with what she writes. I either really love it or can't abide it. For me, the stories were a little too long on the existential, a lot too short on plot, and extra lean on characterization. That's really my biggest problem with all three stories: no characters worth reading about, especially in ""Wave"". So if you prefer stories with characters you can care about, if what's happening to a character is what makes you turn that next page, this is not the book for you. Read Cherryh's ""Chanur"" and ""Foreigner"" series instead."
3,Mind candy,"a visit to the dark places of the mind. as with most science fiction these stories take you to those places we fear to tread, the human experience in the extreme recesses of our minds"
4,Pretty Good,"I don't know if it's a placebo effect or not, but I'll listen to this in my car on my way into work, and I seem to be able to focus better when I get to my job.I also listened to it on my way to school in the evenings, and it seemed to help me concentrate. The music is definately relaxing and stress reducing."
4,good buy again!,I enjoy listening to these and they are effective! you cannot go wrong when you buy cd's like these! I do recommend them!
5,Music for the Mozart Effect Vol. 4,"Each one of these volumes of the Mozart Effect is supposed to have a special effect on you. I don't know if it does. I know they are all very relaxing, and the music is beautiful."
1,"fooled by Amazon's sloppy ""also available in digital"" link below the hard cover book link","I was going to buy this hardcover book and then I saw the ""Also Available in Digital"" link below the book. I bought it in digital thinking it is the full book. It is NOT. It is only sales pitch for the book. Now why would I want to buy that ?I think Amazon is clearly wrong here in not indicating that the digital book is NOT the complete book. I want the money I spent on this to be given as credit when I buy this book. Amazon folks, if you are reading this, let me know how I can get that done."
1,Hollow summary full of fluff,"I did not realize this was a summary when I purchased it. It is about 7 pages of overview which reads more like a ""buy the book"" pitch. I found very little meaningful info in this ebook and would have done as well to read ""Mary had a little lamb"". Maybe the full edition is better."
3,should be called Knitting for the first time **for children**,"This book has baby on the brain big time. A LOT of the patterns are for children, which does you no good if you don't have rug-rats of your own. Also the book's concept of what is difficult and what skills you should learn first is skewed. For instance, making a garment is easier than cables?? It doesn't compute with me.Overall this book is mediocre, from the photography to the patterns. You'd do much better to invest the $10 you'd spend here and put it towards any of the multitude of learn to knit books out on the market now. Elizabeth Zimmerman is a fail safe, and if you're of the younger hip crowd, you may learn a thing or two from Stitch N' Bitch."
3,DX 7630 Adaptor not to Standard,"The buy seems to be great and I'm very happy with the quality of the lens and the photo's. The Adpator however seems to be to short for the Kodak DX7630. If I add the adaptor and Lens and then switch the camera on the camera lens extract up to the telephoto lens and then switch off. The only work about is to first switch the camera on, zoom a bit and then attach the adaptor + telephoto lens - quite a hassle. I've mailed both the Supplier (Sakar) and the Seller (47th st photo) but up to now no response."
2,See the original,"First of all... this is not Romeo and Juliet: It is based on the exquisite and tragic Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. This is a remake of the classic and ever so much better ""Black Orpheus"", made in 1959. If you want to see the soul of the carnival, and hear music that makes you weep, see the original. This new version is a glossy effort to update, but is so ""pop"" it ends up insulting the memory of the heartfelt Marcel Ophuls unmatchable classic.Too much money... not enough soul. 2 stars for the gloss."
2,ho hum,"Some classic films should never be remade. That is of the producers know they will give the very greatest effort.Such is not the case here. Don't wastes your time and money. Stick with the original. If you must, purchase this dvd just to make comparison. If there must be a remake...change the location and a few plot devices. How about New Orleans, La during Mardi Gras? There's an interesting start. Reference that Marpessa Dawn who playe Eurydice in the 1959 original is from New Orleans. Just a thought."
1,American Christmas CD,"I hated it!! Title is deceiving. I should have read more of the details. I was looking for a ""traditional"" Christmas CD. Title says ""American"" not ""Country"". Totally sucked!!"
4,one of the best triping-dubs!!!,"I've been listening to augustus from a long time ago, and this record is like the name 'GOLD', it fills all the conditions that a dub record must have...the smooth sound of JAH!!!! that's why i recommend it to all those reggae and dub-lovers...great for every ocation, dance, chillout............!!!!"
3,"Very easy, light read - maybe a 3 1/2","My book says the author is ""Ann"" Collins, Amazon says ""Judy"" Collins. Is this the same person?This was an easy-to-read, lighthearted romance. Not the best but not the worst I have read. You like all of the main characters & dislike the villians but it lacks depth of feeling. I never really was engrossed in the story."
1,Not Worth The Money,We got this shelf along with the rest of the collection for our son's room. We loved evertything but this shelf. It was not made well for the price!!! It is hung with picture hangers....when you put it on the wall it hangs away from the wall and everthing you put on it can fall off. This is unsafe! My husband tried to drill holes in the front to hang it with screws and it cracked in half. I would return it but we ruined it trying to fix it!
1,Dispointed,"Hello,I had to send the two 18Watt lights back. They did not fit my Mom's lamp. It was so hard to tell what they looked like at the purchasing website that I'm not sure if it wsa my mistake or the company's. I had placed a previous order which never got filled.Thank you,Marion Miller"
4,The Path of Life,"I highly recommend ""The Path of Parenting"" by Vimala McClure.She takes 12 principles from the Taoism and T'ai Chi and applies them to parenting. The wisdom Ms. McClure imparts beckoned me to look inward in order to find my outward relationship with Julien. (Isn't it always this way.)As a result, I have started relaxing, slowing down, and enjoying the moments much more, not just with wee Julien but also with my partner Heather, my work, and even my *gasp* dad!. I have begun to meditate, not for long mantra-filled sessions, mind you, but with a few minutes of pleasant emptiness that really does get me more balanced for the day.I don't often read non-fiction, but this parenting business is all pretty much self-study (pardon the pun) so I have gained a small library. This book is at the front because its taught me some fundamentals of not just parenting, but of living life...James E."
5,Buy this book!,"This book is a must for your home library. It is the benchmark by which all other works in this genre will be judged. The writing is inspired and the pictures and quotes lead you on magical intuitive journey. This is a must for the massively intuitive reader or an intuitive neophyte, just dipping their toe into the waters of intuition. Lynn's down to earth practical approach makes the pages come alive. This one is a must and one of the most wonderful gifts you could ever give to a friend or loved one, not only because it is hands down one of the most beautiful books graphically but because it is life changing in its content."
5,Delightful,"I was concerned when I first looked thru the book that it wouldnt offer what I was looking for, as another reviewer put it, It appeared to be a coffee table, or artsy type of book. However, much to my appreciation, it takes you on a delightful sensory exploration in such an easy way.The chapters are short and to the point and cover so much ground, which enables you to read a little bit if you have very little time and still get the fullness of the lesson or subject in discussion.Beautiful artwork and the addition of the quotes are wonderful. I too, am a possitive affirmation/quote lover and this book completely delights the senses."
1,hard to follow,"I found this book to be hard to follow. It has a one size fits all approach to spirituality that is, well, not based in reality."
3,Great Book To Start With,"While I felt this was a wonderful book for those just starting out on their path to their inner divinity, I was a little disappointed. This book does give you tips and exercises on how to recognize when it is your intuition speaking to you, however it was very basic. If you have read anything like ""A Course in Miracles"", ""Conversatons with God"", or anything by Deepak Chopra than this will be information that you are already familiar with. What I looked forward to every chapter was the fantastic quotes that came from authors, mystics, religios leaders... So while I would recommend this book in general, if you're like me and have a stack of books already by your nightstand and a bookcase full of ones that have been read, re-read and highlighted, this would not be the book for you."
3,Just okay.,"I used to rely on these a lot more. I think with the advance in trading technologies that this has become a bit obsolete. Still, it isn't bad to have around."
4,A dolls house: a political commentary,"I give this book a 7 because it does takle an issue that has been part of society since the start but it is also demening towards women is some instances The play is making a statement about the way that women are treated in Norway at the time when it was written. Nora was Torvald's doll. She was a possesion. The were not in love with each other but instead, with the idea of each other.Do I recamend this book, only if you are boored, it'll only take an hour or two anyways"
3,Teacher Guidebook instead of student edition !,The listing did not indicate that this was the teacher edition.; I needed the student edition. the book is in fair/good condition.
5,Superb!,"What a brilliant album!Even years now after its release I still enjoy it and believe it's a fine, refreshing cd.Of course this album sounds a lot like THE CULT(the band but mostly the album THE CULT) probably because it is the same line-up-except for Ian Astbury.At first I was comparing the two albums, missing the magnificient voice of Astbury, but after a couple of listenings I realised this album wasn't a copy or an under-cult cd, Coloursound is a real band with great songs and melodies.Mike Peeters-who at first I thought sounded a lot like Bono-is a very talented artist expressing a lot of feelings-check out his work on solo or with THE ALARM.The songs are very melodic and profound, the sound is amazing and the production so rich you discover something new every time you play the cd.I was expecting something heavier from BILLY DUFFY, but in the end this album is great as it is!"
4,"Could use a better mix, but great 90's 80's Hybrid","Duffy and Peters meet and dominate the guitar/melodic sound lost in today's market.For Cult fans, this may just be a tease but after several listens you realize why you loved that band so much. Billy's guitar shines on several of the tracks and their is even a nod to Love Removal Machine during a guitar solo.This cd has the sound reminiscent of the 80's alt scene but with a very 90's twist added. Don't get me wrong, this cd has a great modern sound but they never lose their root's in the process.My only fault with this cd is mix. A few moments lose their crunch because of the mix. They could also have not lost too much by throwing out the ""View From A Different Window"" track.This is a great cd and a must for any Cult, Alarm or even Mission fans."
5,Twistedly brillant! Entralling to the last page!,"Even though I'm typically not much for mysteries, I found this book fasinating. It was a quick and easy read. The adventure begins in Echo Falls, a relatively small place where Ingrid Levin-Hill, an eighth grader at Ferrand Middle lives. However, was a so-called ""crazy"" woman is killed, Ingrid will find disturbing secrets that she never knew about! It's a true page turner, and, for once, I actually knew who the murderer was. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Loved it!,I am a little embarrassed but not ashamed to admit that I'm a 28 year old fan. I read the first one in the series and then devoured the second and third the next day. Great!
2,Skip it...,"This ""mystery"" is incredibly simplistic. Any reader over the age of 10 will probably figure it out long before the end. It's also pretty unrealistic. How many things can happen to one kid...and her parents NEVER find out?!? There are much better books out there for young adults. Skip this one."
4,helped slightly with my Veronica Mars withdrawl,"I was wandering around the bookstore a few weeks ago, trying to find something that would remind me of Veronica Mars. I saw this book, and decided I didn't have much to lose.I'm glad I picked it up. It's well written. It wasn't dumbed down like some children's literature can be (I am 23).I will purchase the next book in the series this weekend."
4,"Great story, pity about the ending","Although this is technically a kids book, as an adult I enjoyed reading it as much as any Harry Potter - until the end that is. Peter Abrahams is certainly a gifted thriller writer and his characters just jump off the page. The plot is a classic page turner - the dialogue is taut and realisic. In short, very very enjoyable until the last thirty pages or so when he seems to loose patience and rushes into a very predictable and forced ending. Pity - this had the makings of a real classic."
3,Down the Rabbit Hole: An Echo Falls Mystery,it had alot of suspence! things happened that i would never thought would happen! i had suspisions of one person and the next thing i knew................wham it the person that i least expected!!!!!!!!
3,well written young person mystery,I don't normally read fiction. But I purchased the book on the assumption it was relevant to the What the Bleep movie and book. And while there's a relationship it was not as tenuous as I would have liked.
3,Augustin's take on the psalms (1 - 24),"I was surprised at St. Augustine's fervent Christo-centric interpretation of these first few psalms. But, I like it. This is definitely a companion volume to Navarre, or other more historical analysis. I am glad I bought thisbook; always ponder St. Augustine's take when I have a low-numbered psalm. He puts me in the proper frame of mind . . . trying to get closer to Christ."
3,Animed aimed squarely at kids,"Unlike some anime produced for younger viewers such as the series Kanon, yet is appealing and entertaining to adults, this series is aimed at young kids and no one else."
5,You gotta see this oone must buy for da family,I really had no ideal what this was till I brought it I fell in love with it.Its a heart felt very touching seris.It speaks of true love and willing to do anything for your family.Here a boy all alone who finds out he has a home and family who is lost along the way he changes for the best and finds himself.Its a long seris but it brings back those days one had bein with their family.How he grows an learns to cheerish who his family is really its a heart felt seris if u got kids family buy it watch the seris with them.Please buy this u will love it as much as I do
3,Intelligent 50's sci-fi flick...,"This is a very thought provoking 50's sci-fi in which an alien gives five people from around the world capsules with which they can destroy all life on the planet Earth. The catch is that the alien never mentions just how the capsules will destroy the earth so each of the five are left to their own wits in dealing with the ensuing adventure as others become aware that they possess these death capsules.A nice intelligent effort with a twist ending that makes this one very worthwhile for 50's sci-fi buffs. Makes a great double feature with Five, another intellignet and lesser known 50's sci-fi flick that deals with the Earth's end!!"
4,Good introduction to the subject,"This is an excellent textbook-style introduction to its topic. Although a few of the more nuts-and-bolts chapters were pretty tough going for a Humanities guy like myself, overall the book is quite readable, amply illustrated, and very broad in its coverage. The topics include biological (heredity, genetics, mutation, selection) aspects of evolution, both in terms of internal mechanics and of large-scale case-studies, as well as political and religious considerations. It also includes an appendix with biographies of the major figures in evolutionary thought, a glossary, and a brief annotated bibliography. Although Richard Dawkins' _River out of Eden_ is shorter and more user-friendly, this is the most comprehensive brief introduction to the topic that I've seen."
3,counter sink,"this product cuts countersinks very well, however you must clean out the center hole in it after every countersink hole you cut... it's not hard i just use the drill bit i going to use to drill the hole but it is a pain in the neck and slows down everything. i have used it on hardwood and softwood and MDF and i have the same problem everytime"
1,I've been had!,I thought I was buying a pdf version of the ENTIRE book! This thing is only 15 pages long! I want my money back!
1,No Stars for the Publisher,"I started the read the book with great interest. It has a lots of technical details with illustrations. When I reached page 76 it was a disappointment to see that the chart of the right eye had a printing error in that the lower half was not completed. The illustrations are important part of the book as the text refer to them numerous times.I contacted the publisher signaling the problem and asked for help. I got no answer at all.Unfortunately, Amazon does not have a feature for customers to complain about printing problems discovered in books that they sell.Now, I have an incomplete book and no remedy for the problem."
5,Da Return of da Loced-Out Gizzangsta,SATURDAY NIGHT-------AARON GETS WAY HIZZIGH!!!!Weed smokin' muhfuh!!!!AC (and I don't mean Al Cowlings) is in da HIZZOUSE!!!!Aaron Carter=Spot in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
1,Will He Ever Give Up???,Ok Aaron. GIVE UP and SHUT UP. You can't make a comeback because you have no talent. Your 15 minutes of fame are up. Deal with it.
5,aaron carter,i think that ppl dont give aaron enough credit. he is a good singer and he actually cares about his fans. i went to one of his concerts a few weeks ago and he was really nice cool and dedicated to his fans something that u might not find in some other celebs. i think his new singe;' saturday night' is hot and awesome! a great song to 'jam' to.and i think ppl should not say that he is like 10 yrs old cuz hes not. hes 17. and im not just defending him cuz im a 13 yr old who think hes hot. i think he has great talent or in adults words' potential'peace out ;}
5,This is Definetly One of Aaron's Best songs Yet!,"This is a Great song by Aaron Carter. Like his music in the past, this CD has no swearing on it, it's fun and catchy... I especially like the remixes. Especially track 3. This one kind of wants you to get up and dance. Anyone know when Aaron will come out with a new CD yet? I have been reading rumors about it for over a year, and I haven't heard anything about it yet. If he is, when will it come out in the United States?"
5,Better than previous efforts...,"Aaron Carter never really could sing. He had a cute face, a famous older brother, and a nice group of kid fans. But, to give him some credit, Saturday Night, his new single, is a lot better. It's great for a teen crowd instead of seven to eleven year old girls. The single's a great dance track, and has a great beat and sound. Overall, it is Aaron Carter's best effort, and might just be the thing to give him the comeback he needs."
5,Aaron rocks!,Aaron is the best artist out there. He is often under estimated I think and doesn't always get the acknowledgement he deserves. He has the best songs and music with beats. Aaron also puts on the BEST concert I've ever been to! Love this song!
5,Tight,Tight its allthat needs to be said aaron carter sucks well that what i thought until i herd this i jst got from Amazon.com and its worth the money.... get it....
5,I recommend this book to all teenagers my age.,"I read Time for Andrew. This book was the only book I really liked and could read again. It was about a boy named Andrew who had to go to his aunt's house for the summer. There was an old man living there who didn't like Andrew. Andrew finds out why when he gets to the attic and goes back in time to when the old man was a kid. He switched places with a kid whose name is Andrew and looks like Andrew. He only switched places because he didn't want him to die of diphtheria. One of the best parts of this book is when Andrew has to jump off the tressel into the river. But he didn't and his mean cousin fell in and started to drown. He jumped in and saved him. His cousin didn't even care that he got saved. A part of the book I disliked was when Andrew from the past wanted to switch places so he could be back in his own time, but he had to win a game of marbles and he lost."
3,Good Plot,"Drew travels to his aunt's creepy old house to stay for the summer. One night he discovers Andrew his long dead, distant cousin, who has diptheria. Because they are almost identical in appearance they switch places in order for Andrew to get modern medical attention. So once Andrew is healthy again he doesn't want to switch back, so Andrew says when Drew can beat him in marbles he will switch back.I like the plot of the story because it keeps you wondering what will happen next, especialy when Drew gets dared to jump off a high trustle, by a bully.. It is a good book, I suggest you read it."
4,Time For Andrew- A Great Book,"Drew goes to stay at his great-aunt's house while his parents are in France for the summer. He meets a boy named Andrew who is supposed to be dead, but somehow he has transported himself from his time, 1910, to the present. Andrew begs Drew to switch ""places"" with him. Andrew has been sick and wants to stay in Drew's time until he is well. Drew is a worrier and is doubtful about the idea. They switch places and Drew becomes more like Andrew that himself everyday, and the same happens to Drew. They finally switch back when Drew beats Andrew in Ringer. The next day, Drew's great-aunt tells him that her cousins (Andrew and his sister) are coming for a visit. Andrew and Drew talk and go out to the little cemetary behind the house. They look for Andrew's grave and don't find it. That means that Andrew lived."
4,Time for Andrew,"My book is about a character who finds a sick boy, and that the boy was from the future. Andrew's sister, and John thought they were going to live a long long time, and that Andrew's sister was ruining his life. Read this book, and find out if Andrew dies or not."
3,Where are all our favorite characters?,"Star Wars Monopoly - great idea. Leaving out Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C3-PO, Yoda, Jabba, Boba Fett, and / or a Stormtrooper seems inexcusable. Why did they include a TIE Fighter Pilot, Tusken Raider, and Grand Moff Tarkin? Did they even ask the fans what characters they'd want? Great idea, just poorly executed. Hasbro, we expect more from you."
3,"For a Star Wars junkie, perhaps...","The mechanics of the game are generally true to Monopoly. I really love the Star Wars films and I have read fair amount of Star Wars fiction, but I found the unique place names a tad too obscure to make play easy the first time around.If you have a die-hard Star Wars fan who knows all the names of all the characters, and the planets they are from, this is probably the game for them.It wasn't the game for me, but so far my eldest son has taken a shine to it..."
3,Not at all as expected.,"Poor packaging. Cat hair in the box. Everything thrown around in the box.I love Star Wars and I love Monopoly, but the product I received wasn't worth the money."
4,interesting,"it is very interesting to play this kind of monopoly.if you are realy star wars fun,you should have this game.But the producer needs to thing to change the park and prisonaccording to starwars style."
1,can you give less than one?,Absolute ripoff! Tends to sour one's opinion about buying on-line where you can't properly view the product. Will think twice before next purchase. Live and learn? I'm learning!
3,Not bad,"This album has a suprisingly high amount of stars backing it up.I always found that it was a patchy affair with one good song followed by a very average effort.Admittedly it does have some great moments as well.I enjoy hearing Malmsteen within the framework of a band,he sounds free to do what he pleases but he does not smother the album with his guitar workouts.He is a great guitarist but he is far easier to stomach like this than in full Mozart Guitar master phase.Graham Bonnet puts in a solid vocal performance,for the time period it is a good album but it is not great."
2,BE CAREFUL,I THINK THERE MUST BE A DEFECT IN THIS ITEM SEVERAL TIMES IT HAS DEFLATED IN THE WATER I AM NOW VERY LEARY OF PRODUCT NOT SURE I WILL USE AGAIN
2,Mabel's quality has declined. Be prepared for leaks.,"We had a Super Mabel for three years that never had any problems. It blew away in a storm. We bought a new one, and discovered the product quality has greatly declined. The case is falling apart, and the bladder gets a new hole in one of two of the same places every time we take it out. I've patched about 15 holes. It is a total pain."
4,Large Raft,"I was looking for a large raft to pull my grandkids on who are young. This is a very large raft. Able to pull children in a upright position very well, and also great for going fast with adults. Raft arrived on time. Very sturdy made. Was a little uncomfy with the price for a raft but it looks like it is made very well and will hold up in time hopefully."
1,Disappointing,I didn't like the writing style ... Not very insightful .. Many other preferable books about Ecuador and various regions.
1,Cats are OBLIGATE CARNIVORES.,"This is junk food for cats.Cats must eat meat. This food does not contain taurine and other essential vitamins that a cat can't obtain from vegetable sources. Cats that eat this food are facing a horrible death from vitamin deficiencies, possibly including blindness first. I'd feed my cat the cheapest store brand before giving her this stuff."
4,Was pleasantly suprised,I didn't think I'd like this novel as much as Radclyffe's other books but I was wrong. This book was hard to put down once I started reading it. Don't let the book jacket (description) deter you from reading this book.
1,disappointed,"I usually love the Baby Einstein books, but this one is very short for one thing, and the poems aren't very baby friendly, in that they don't really rhyme or flow well. The pictures are beautiful, but I don't think many babies will appreciate them. I just found the book pretty boring and now I'm frustrated that I paid over $6 for a book I don't like."
2,not what i thought it would b,it isn't what i thought it would be. not sure if i will give it to the prospective parents like i thought i would
2,Flimsy,"Disappointed that this bracket could not hold the weight of my Westcott 5 in 1 40"" reflector. I had to crank the handle down so tight that it broke. I'm sure it would work fine for small, lightweight reflectors but look for something more solid or with a metal ball and socket clamp if you are working with larger reflectors."
1,Boring,If you are at home alone and there is absolutely and I mean absolutely nothing else to do then and only then watch this movie. I had to keep watching it thinking over and over again this can only get better. Second rate performances bad quality movie about nothing. Rated about as much fun as watching paint dry.
2,Slow Pacing and Dreary Lives,"Relationship trials and tribulations aside, this movie is just plain plodding and sluggish. I wanted to like it, really I did. It is NOTHING like ""The Big Chill"" (which the ""box"" indicates)... it has no real charm, no depth of history between these men, and no break from the endless parade of gray moodiness. It fell short of even convincing me any of these people loved each other (including the frienships). Disappointing."
3,Convoluted and entertaining,"While clearly not for everyone, this film portrays a set of relationships which are not that uncommon . What sets them apart is that all the players are men. The usual bits of jealousy and ""oops, I meant to tell you"" are all there, with a twist. Not a date movie!"
1,Be careful downloading e-books!!,"I was disapointed when I downloaded it and got 8 pages.As a customer, I expected to have the digital version of the full book and not a summary.I thought that the price difference was due to the absence of paper, printing, handling, shipping, etc.The hardcover version is more than 300 pages; if you take the price per page of the digital version, the hardcover version should cost then ten times more!!!All the examples are referred to that version and nowhere I was said that I was paying 5 dollars for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT.I honestly believed that I was buying the full book.I will think better before ebuying again...."
1,I was scamed,This download is a trick. All of the reviews and product descriptions depict the hardcover book which is hundreds of pages long. Do not be fooled like I was thinking you would get the entire book in digital form. I payed my money and recieved a 12 page version of the full book I expected to get.
1,A Disappointing Read.,"As a memeber of the OBOD (Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids), I expected more of this book. Rather than aiding the individual in understanding the wonderful daily and practical applications of druidry (a goal the author establishes for herself in the intro), this book is an abstract, self-indulgent dissertation on personal mystical experiences which both confuses and irritates the sensitive reader. Part of this outcome may be due to the difficulty in finding adequate ways to express personal spiritual experience; however, the tone of the book is dour rather than joyful, and the fairy-filled, ghost-laden pages, are likely to turn-off anyone who is trying seriously to grow in their own practical spiritual experiences."
1,Definitely Not for Beginners,"I never finished this book.I should of sent it back.I've been a practicing Witch for 10 yrs. and have even attended Druid rituals (Old Stone Grove in GA.) I think this woman is flaky! Sorry Emma,but if you have these kind of experiences why write about them? They are obviously the kind of thing YOU have to experience to understand.I have had unexplained things happen to me too,but to write about things that words cannot describe is ludicrous!They can't be explained in physical terms.To me this book gives fuel to people who say Witches,Druids & Pagans are crack-pots. I would have gave it a NO STAR rating if they had one."
5,Better than expected,"No problems at all item is well made and works well especially for the price. Shipping was problem free, shipping create was in perfect condition on arrival barely a scratch"
2,Social stereotypes instead of Biological ones,"Is sport really to blame for the suffering of black people in the West? Of course the special success of black athletes has a lot to do with the negative realities of racist society. But it also has something to do with the strength of people who have faced adversity and not given up, or at least have the drive to try to secure for themselves a future. Society depends on such people, so is it really a bad thing that they become role models? The ""Black Cause"", insofar as it does or should exist, is not retarded each time a black athlete crosses the finish line. But it is retarded every time a teacher expects less from a black kid, or a rich black superstar suddenly becomes content with the status quo, or a writer makes money by replacing a false biological stereotype (and it is false, I've done the research Jon Entine failed to do) with an equally false social one."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this for my step daughter, I did receive it on time but the seam of the animal was torn and made a hole. I did not notice until she went to play with it and she did not want to wait for me to return."
5,Lonely at the top,"This isn't a how-to-be-a-CEO book. It is a collection of interviews with top CEOs and their answers to questions about success, leadership and personal values. I enjoyed keeping this book nearby and reading one or two CEO profiles a day. In the last chapter or two, the authors summarize the common themes they found in the interviews. It could be used as a checklist of what should be important to you as a CEO."
3,Each of us could be the top 50!,"The successful leaders were always those who did not think that they possessed anything special and yet widely recognised. Why? Well, these were the people who possessed the same qualities that everyone of us had. Then why were they highly sought after and admired.The authors interviewed 51 great leaders and summarised the 10 traits that great leader possessed. You have all ten of them except that you lack the confidence that you are born great. Reading through this book help you to rediscover yourself, and you could be the next great leader!I would recommend this book to anyone who is already at the top of the corporate pyramid and those who are at the base, because through reading the materials, and by rediscovering yourself, you are likely to bring up the undiscovered side of yourself and help yourself and corporation to achieve greater height!"
1,corporate dribble,"This book is not much more than a collection of fluff put together with little to no content. While I am sure Neff has experience interviewing the top, very little relevant information was shared."
1,Unintentionally hilarious,"This book profiles both Bernie Ebbers (Worldcom) and Kenneth Lay (Enron), along with other CEOs. It lauds them all with fulsome praise, scattered with homespun aphorisms of the type normally found in Readers' Digest, and interleaved with down-home anecdotes and capsule corporation summaries that tell you nothing about running a business.Much of the book is devoted to describing how the book came about; it's how the book starts and how it ends.The book may be worth reading just for its list; which profiled and praised CEO will be next to turn out to be fatally flawed?Another reader's description of 'corporate dribble' is concise and accurate."
3,"A ""could've been""","In skimming through this at the bookstore I thought it was a ""can't miss."" Turns out it could miss.I praise the author's strategy in that they assemble a wonderful group of leaders and pick their brain on a variety of issues - great for the average reader. The problem is that the data they gathered is pretty much raw data and needs some analysis to translate it into actionable findings. This isn't done until the end, and in my opinion, should have been 50% of the book, not 5%.With everyone crunched for time, there are other business books that will provide better, more concise information. Save your time unless you have too much of it :)"
1,short,"very disappointed in this item, the discription said one height and it turned out to be shorter than described"
1,Didn't play at all,Paid a lot for this one and put it into my dvd player and nothing but streaks of color. Not a scratch on disc and right out of sealed box. First bad one in over a year.
1,lanza was right,beacuse your mine is lousy the scipt is terrible and what lanza had to go through could be called touture not even the title song is perfict his performance of the song angels sing is much better
3,A Golden Oldie.... thats all Mine.,"A terrific movie, with some great performance from Mario Lanza,the plot of the movie runs perfect, A Singing Star gets drafted into the Army, and his superior Sargent, played by James Whitmore, a Star I admired for 30 years.Its got some nice Romantical content too, and the whole package was without a doubtFabulous Entertainment, I realise these movies are out on DVDs in many instances, however I favour VHS tapes ,"
5,Stolen Words... An Awesome Book!!,"Stolen Words is a great book. I really recommened it. I'm not a very fast reader, but I read it in a weekend, and COULDN'T PUT IN DOWN!!!! Buy it today!!"
3,"O.K., but not great","Stolen Words is about a girl who goes on a vacation with her family and all their stuff gets stolen. It has some funny stuff n it but it's not all that great. Throughout most of the book, all she does is complain, complain, complain. My sister likes amy Goldman Koss--but not me."
3,"a good read, but exasperating at times","This book offers a fascinating glimpse into the worldviews of some of the world's top CEOs. Garten also offers his prescriptions for how he thinks those worldviews should be expanded. While his arguments are not always persuasive and not always fully backed up, his ideas and the CEOs' responses to them are interesting to read and think about.On the other hand, Garten is often too credulous when his subjects feed him meaningless platitudes, and often too willing to spout similarly meaningless platitudes of his own. The title of Chapter 5, for example, is ""Vision without Execution is an [sic] Hallucination."" The chapter is as vapid as the title makes it sound.Overall, this short (less than 300 pages) book is worth a read by both business types and non-business types who are interested in how some of the world's most powerful people see things, and how one person on the periphery of the business world sees how the role of the CEO should change."
3,How about the women?,"Were only male CEO's interviewed? I know there are still only a few women in these ranks yet I keep reading how women make great leaders because of their relationship skills to name one. In the end, it's diversity that makes a great company and an open mind that makes for a great leader."
3,The mind of the Ceo,"After reading this book, I have a deep understanding of what problems Ceos face in thier businesses. They need to tackle the challenges of the gobalization and internet. If they can handle it well, they can succeed. Moreover, the Ceos need to set up a true north so as to hold an organization together, customers would have much confidence to the organization.In the book, it also points out one important thing is that, it is important for a company to have vision, but if it cannot executed, it is meaningless. It is very impressive, as the world is changing in every second, if you don't take any action immedately, you will fail."
3,Dated but practical,This book was written prior to 9/11 and has a very growth oriented view that resulted from the expansion of the 1990s. It captures the minds of CEOs during the internet boom (a chapter dedicated to it) and what it meant to business at the time. It is not so relevant today.The book is one of few that focus on corporate management but still place a good dose of social responsibility and content within the book.
4,Politics: public office for private gain- the Devil's Dictionary is great.,"Very good. I enjoy reading Bierce. I like short stories, tales, -some of Bierce's are not merely short, but very, very short. He has a sardonic sense of humor, one might take him to be a misanthrope, and some of his tales have a twist like a corkscrew. Some of his stories end abruptly- as a bullet or cannon ball putting an end to it mid-sentence."
4,Recommended as a first C++ text.,"A lucid traversal of basic OOP concepts and the C++ language. Lots of exercises, at a rather low level of detail. J&K focus on the basics, avoiding the trap that others (e.g. Lippman & La Joie) fall into of trying to cover too many advanced topics in an introductory text. A scattering of typos and minor errors should not confuse the perceptive reader."
1,Condition of book greatly mis-described!!!!,"This book was described as ""like new."" Instead the binding was broken and the pages were not even attached to the binding. The seller did not reply to my inquiry about getting another copy. A terrible experience."
5,Deep and Focused,I've read this book twice and experienced a deeper connection of the Hara each time. This is a most excellent book that deserves focused attention to read. A great exercise in grounding.
3,For die-hard Alice Walker fans only,"I love Alice Walker. Most of her novels have made a huge impact on my life, The Color Purple included. Having said that, I must confess that Same River Twice disappointed me. It contains journal entries that I'd be just as happy not knowing about, Walker's version of her screenplay adaptation of Purple, and numerous insights about death, dying, and spirituality. She writes somewhere that her daughter, Rebecca, had urged her to publish this book as a small, quiet tome, with little or no publicity, for those only interested in knowing every personal detail that went along with producing this infamous movie. I wish she had followed this advice. It is a sweet book, especially for those who have suffered with Lyme Disease, but those interested in Walker's immense literary talent, this is not the book for you. Celebrity tidbits, morning affirmations, and light-weight commentaries on being an African-American mother, daughter, woman are its strengths."
5,Amazon Quality - Steady and Sure,"The one thing I can always count on when I order direct from Amazon is that my product will be in premium condition and generally arrives very quickly (considering the number of warehouses they work with, I'd expect nothing less.) With the various vendors it can be hit and miss- the only ""room for improvement"" I see with Amazon.com is being able to match the low prices of the individual vendors. If they could, I'd buy exclusively from them."
5,Excellent Timing,I Couldn't have asked for better seller. Item Got here before expected and at the the perfect time. I was looking at the tracking info and realized that it was sitting in the mail box as I was thinking about it. =) =)
4,Great Season with a few complaints,"I liked this season butr I do have a few complaints:1) What the heck was up with the tattoo ink2) Why did they introduce the gay girl (that really bugged me because it ruined a main beloved character)3) Where was the carnival really at it just seemed to appear where ever he wanted it but his power was supposed to be earth manipulationThat was just the few things that bugged me, especially #2."
1,A load of rubbish,"The 1st season of Heroes prior to the last the last episode was good the rest have been awful. Season 4 starts poorly and plumets down hill from there. The plot is muddled and the stories drag on into nothingness. Nothing makes sense and seems to have been penned by an absent minded 4 year old. The main villain was awful and his followers, a bunch of mindless non entities that seem to no opinions of there own. Most of the time you find yourself hoping the disk will skip ahead as the episodes are so dull, long winded and ultimately go nowhere. I would rather throw the money away then buy this box set."
5,Aaron's Review,"This is one of the best season of Heroes. Sorry that this is the last one, but I will always be ready if they decide to make another season, you can count me in on acquiring it."
1,Fallin from glory,"It's obvious that the show runner never knew how to followup season one and you can tell as each season has gotten progressively bad. Skip this show and watch something better written. The dialogue and scenes all became beyond funny and that's why this once great show was cancelled. Viewers got tired of the Producers saying, oh, it will be good again. That never happened."
3,An Undeserved Ending,"Heroes started out as a phenomenon. It was a show that caught on like Lost, House and all the other major shows that were released around it's time. Sadley after an extremly successful first season and a TV writters strike Heores never was the same.This season was titled Redemption and it was a season that deserved the title. We were introduced to some great new characters as well as a very interesting new story. Yet the show never was able to bring itself back to the impactful first season and NBC just decided to cit the chord. To me I am all about closure and not to give Heores a proper send off was terrible. I had heard there were plans for a 2 hour series finale made for TV movie, but it was scrapped. Either way as a whole Heroes was a very interesting take on the whole superhero theme and I am very glad to know that I was able to be a part of it."
4,Hereos DVD,My brother got me started on this series so have been watching them on Netflix but bought them for him for Christmas gift.
5,ok,"All perfect. Great music, original story, with action sequences very well done.very good history, a great pity it was canceled."
5,Great product,Highly recommend if you enjoyed the show. Make sure you also pick up the other seasons so you have them all.
3,Bad Ending,"The dvd set was in I think perfect position, but the story of the final season was horrible, and I really wish the show ended after the third season."
5,Love it!,"Product was brand new still in the wrapping. Videos are great! My fiance was so excited to get this for his birthday. It was exactly what I expected from amazon. No different than buying it at the store, just didn't have to fight the crowds."
1,Waste of time,Once again heroes spends an entire season building up to nothing. This time we see Claire whine some more and experiment with her akward girlfriend. Sylar is once again confused and wandering. And Peter is completely useless and weak like a little kid to no suprise. The apparent villain in this series fizzles out in a pathetic battle. The entire season is a complete and unmitigated waste of time. The writers of this show never cease to amaze at how easily they can disappoint.
