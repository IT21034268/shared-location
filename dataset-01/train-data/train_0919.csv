2,"Adventures of a Psychic , a reincarnation of MyGuide, Myself","I was so excited to see Sylvia on Montell Williams show that I rushed out that day to buy ""Adventures of a Psychic"". The book was soo good that I read it in one night. It was so good to know that there is life after death and I will see my loved ones and not be in fear when that day comes. That same week I wanted more of Sylvia's works so I went to our local library and found ""My Guide My Self"". Boy was I disappointed. Here I found that this book dated 2/90 was the same EXACT book word for word, page for page, as the book I had just gone and paid $13 dollars for. I felt cheated. I don't know if Sylvia realized that we would find this out but I hope she addresses this and I feel an apology is owed to all who have gone to buy this book and then later to find out its the same EXACT book. Shame on you Sylvia!"
1,A bit on the melodramatic side,"I felt Sylvia Browne's Book ""Adventures of a Psychic"", was a bit on the melodramatic side. I couldn't find anything substantial about the life of, ""Sylvia Browne"", in fact I thought there was an awful lot of blaming the other person for all that went wrong in her life especially in the last chapter. I couldn't believe that anyone who claims to be such a tool for Gods good works could ever stoop so low, as to allow themselves to be promoted in this type of forum usually reserved for Movies, sports, and comedy specials, not spiritualists"
5,"Incredible, Uplifting everything makes much more sense now","I've read the book, I have all of her tapes and presently in the Gnostic Study Group which is so amazing the other books and tapes are quite exialterating and gives you a positive outlook on life that this is hell we live it, here to perfect our soul the other side is where it's ""WELL order the tapes/Go to a ""LECTURE in your AREA"" once you become educated in this area you will feel such a sigh of relief and developed spiritually ""WORDS CAN'T express it!!!! Don't stop there have Sylvia or her son Christopher do a reading they're both so on target I've had a reading from both of them simply ""AMAZING"""
1,LOVEDIT!,"OHHHHHH! This book has worked miracles on me. Honestly, I thought that I knew what a Psychic was , and that I was one! Now I know by reading this wonderfulbook that I am actually just a person with radiation poisoning coupled with insomnia. Isn't that great! Well I'm off to practice my mind kata, please for the love of whatever god you worship, buy this product! PLEASE!"
5,"""This book was enlightening, and really opened my mind.""","Sylvia Brown is a interesting woman blessed with a wonderful gift. This book touches all aspects of her past, present and future. I wasn't a believer until now."
2,Interesting but unbelieveable,"I've seen Silvia on Montel a couple of times and decided to read her book, this is the first and only book I've ever read by Silvia by the way. I found it very interesting but when I came to the section where she had decided that today's religion was out of date, so she started her own religion,(that is when I threw the book out in the trash.) If you want to know the truth, just open the good book, it's right there in black and white. I love the way people just change things so that it fits what they want to believe. Don't go looking for some psyhic to give you all the answeres. I looked up Slyvia's predictions online and found a lot that didn't come true. That was all I needed to know. I believe we all have powers we haven't begun to tap into but I also believe we need to use common sense here as well. I give this book one two stars for interesting yet unbelieveable."
5,This book can enlighten your life as well as your heart.,"I admit I haven't finished it all but I have read most of this book. I can't wait until I finish it. This book so far has helped me and I know it can help most of everyone. Either to understand things, not be so scared of things, etc... This book is for the soul...it will touch you in some way."
4,A great book,"This life story is truly awesome, with bazarr information, and out of the ordinary occurances that have happened to this women in the past. Sylvia explains, and educates the public with her childhood imagery, and problems/mishaps which occured while growing up.... Truly fascinating, this book is, that I must say Sylvia is an inspiration... Thank you Sylvia."
5,despite some other reviews.....,"this is a very good book. it's basically an auto-biography and gives the reader an insight into sylvia's early life and early psychic adventures. also, shows childhood pics and pics of her sons and grandchildren...definitely a good read!!"
5,"Wonderful, easy reading. Very truthful.","I was caught up in the otherwise normal life of one of our leading psychics. I have always had a feeling that Sylvia was a very caring person, and now that I have read her book, I can see that I was right,the book reveals why she is that way today. Sylvia went through many trials and tribulations in her lifetime and we are reaping the rewards."
5,Totally Amazing,"This is wonderful, insightful book, of an amazing woman, and her gift from god. Not only do you learn about Slyvia herself, she teaches you so much about the other world, life after death, amd why things happen the way the do. I learned so much from this book, and feel slike i have gained a friend in the process. She is genuine and down to earth, and is truly a gift from god."
4,Thought-provoking and very believable.,"I liked this book. However, I found the first half to be rather slow-going and somewhat boring. But the last half held some real zingers, and gave me alot to think about. Some of the things Sylvia says, particularly about enhancing our spirit and reincarnation, I seem to have always known but never expressed it out loud before. As a personal example, my son who I had not raised as a child and I recently have been united. We have shockingly found that we both have a deep connection with Ireland, both in music and a yearn to ""return."" We both found parts of the movie ""Far and Away"" to cause a yearning in our hearts. We both now feel that at one time we were together in Ireland in some fashion and that it has remained with us in spirit even unto today. The book was a gift for my daughter, but I read it first. She has since read it through twice and continues to email me her praises of it, and she plans to travel to see Ms. Browne in the future."
5,At last! Some real answers.....,"I have always had, what I thought was just a good sense of danger, and what was going on around me. You know how you say, ""Something just told me....."" or ""I just had a feeling..."" I now know what that all means. I chose to listen to my spirit guide(s), to hear the voice(s). Dreams I have had that seemed so very vivid, were and are, a lot of times, messages from the Other Side. If you truly believe, you WILL receive. This book has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this is true. Sylvia is obviously a God- send in the most literal sense. You get what you give in life, so let's all give our best to everyone."
1,Beyond awful,"There are any number of worthwhile books by or about psychics and mediums. This isn't one of them. It should be subtitled ""My Fixation with My Womanizing Father"" (doting Sylvia's comment on the death of her Been Dumped By."" Ms. Browne comes across as shallow, obnoxious and about as insightful as a large rock. This book was in my bag of things to donate to Goodwill five seconds after I finished it. Truly a worthless book. It tells you essentially nothing meaningful about her ""psychic gifts,"" even if you believe she has them. Read something by or about Eileen Garrett"
5,Adventures of a Psychic by Sylvia Browne,"I loved her story. She has a witty, compelling writing style. Her information is revelational and practical. I found her LAB exercise to be an invaluable tool for self-help. Highly recommended for anyone who is doing ""soul-searching"" work."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"This book loses all credibility the moment Sylvia Browne declares that all the world's religions fail to provide the spiritual needs of the world. Fortunately, Sylvia Browne (know it all) comes to the rescue! For the benefit of the rest of us she establishes a new religion."
5,Understanding Death,I've lost two friends both in car accidents and I could never undestand why God had to take them away from me. I was very depressed and had a hard time dealing with it. I still have my days but after reading this book I now have a clear understanding of death and what heaven is like. Thank you so much for writing this book Sylvia. I know you're here to help people and you've done just that. Jason died almost two years ago and it just seems like yesterday when I last saw his sweet smile. I know that both of my friends are in a better place now looking down on my from above. I can't wait to be there with them. They'll never be forgotten and I'll love them forever.
4,Very Interesting,"I don't agree with everything in her book, but I did come away with something I don't think I'll ever forget. ""Don't let anyone diminish your life!""This book may at times seem a bit simplistic, but there are some real gems in here, if you just pay attention to the message she is trying to convey."
2,Believe what you will...,"This is a book for people who, deep down, already know what they want to believe but just need someone to legitimize it. The content, while perhaps not true or believable, is obvious in its intent. You might feel better about life after reading this book. That's as good a reason as any to read it!"
5,The Complete Book of Cat Breeding,"Excellent resource on breeding, written by a vet who actually likes cats, knows cats, and cares about cats! We are just beginning a 'hobby breeders' with our Dearheart Persian female (a niece of the cat in the Fancy Feast commercial) and we really appreciated the information on what to provide for birthing, what to do for the babies, and how to care for them. Very informative book, we highly recommend this book!"
4,Great Bok,"This book is very informative and helpful. It really gave me alot of ideas about how to breed my cats. Being a new breeder of Ragdolls, it really opened my eyes to what I was doing wrong. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that has never had experience with breeding. The only thing I found to be not included in the book, was the different breeds."
4,Very Good Resource,Should be on the reference shelf of every serious cat breeder. It contains some specific information about pregnancy and delivery that I've not seen in other cat books. It's also discusses the breeding program process. A good overview.
5,AMAZINGLY CLEAR,DON'T BE TURNED OFF BY THE PRICE!!! If any major retailer like BBuy or CCity sold this it'd be at least $300! I can't even come up with a negative to say about it. You will need to warm it up for a good 100 hours before it sound it's best though. I have the DV-84 and 64 towers and love them as well. I can't say enough good about this brand of speaker. They are an undiscovered gem so you can get them for so cheap.
5,Bad to the bone,"Ok this center channel speaker is the whole deal. It has upper end lower end and mid range. The base on this is amazing. 75% of the movies sound comes from the center channel so if your going to watch matrix, star wars, jurrasic park, LORTR, This center channel will do them beyond Justice. This is a bad ass center channel bose Has nothing on this baby. Buy this add it to your system you will be very impressed anf for 100 buck you cant go wrong."
4,A good deal,"This center channel is a good deal. For the price, you just can't beat it! It can sound a little mid-rangy at times, but that could be my room acoustics too. It does deliver excellent voice reproduction, clear and crisp for movies. I would say it does not perform quite as well with music though. I have a set of older Infinity Sterling 2004 series speakers for the left and right mains and they sound a bit more natural. However, I think to beat the sound quality of this BIC you would have to spend at least $300 on a center channel speaker. Over all I am satisfied and will keep this one!"
2,Not Impressed,"This speaker is acceptable for voice, but lousy for music, as the low-end is very muddy, uneven, and boomy. If you use your home theater system to listen to music, look elsewhere. A run-of-the-mill bookshelf speaker actually sounds better for all content."
5,Great Speaker !!,"I replaced the Yamaha center channel speaker with this BIC DV-62CLR-S center channel speaker and the difference was dramatic. It is a great sounding speaker with exceptional clarity and has dual drivers which lends to an awesome sound.Anyone who has an all-in-one Home Theater system should get this speaker as a center channel because the supplied speakers are of inferior quality.Forget the well known branded speakers, this on beats them hands down. It has a genuine wooden enclosure unlike the particle board in others.It is also much bigger in size, so make sure it will fit your stand !!"
4,Does size matter?,"Before I comment on the quality, you should know: THIS IS A BIG CENTER SPEAKER! About the size of a smaller wastebasket. If you're space-conscious, you should probably try the smaller model BIC...The center channel is where a majority of the action happens when watching a movie or listening to music in 5.1 mode. If you were to make one upgrade in your setup, you get the most bang for the buck with the center.Anyhow, big speaker, big sound. The sound is wide enough to create a convincing 'wall of sound' with the left and right fronts. With the separate woofers and tweeters, instruments are well-separated in the mix and also provide a pretty-sounding bass.If you are an appreciator of audio and have a capable system, I would highly reccomend this as a purchase. I come from an 'all-in-one-home-theater' background, so hearing something with this much clarity and richness was new and quite noticeable."
5,Awesome sound,"Paired this with the DV62si's and a Polk Audio PSW-505 and a Yamaha V373 Receiver and I am more than thrilled.This center channel speaker surpasses what I expected.I promise that you will not find a better sounding center channel speaker for the price,maybe not even twice the price!!!"
4,MERENGUE PARA EL BAILADOR,"Grupo Heavy presenta su segundo disco titulado ""Ganas De Ti"" para RMM Records. Este disco esta bien bailable y lleno de sabor. El disco fue producido por Luisin Marti. Los mejores temas que tiene el CD son ""Cara De Niña"", ""Despues De Ti"" y ""Ganas De Ti"". Merengue del bueno pa'l bailador. Tambien recomiendo ""Estoy Buscando"" de Beverly, ""Es Mi Tiempo"" de Manny Manuel y ""Deddie Romero"" (Mas De Mi) de Deddie Romero."
3,Bold tribute,"I heard this album being played in a record store and was interested because I thought I heard a guy singing a Madonna song. After buying it, I think this album is great because many of the bands boldly interpret her songs in their own unique way, not like some other tribute albums where the artists just try to do an imitation of the original artist without any creative input of their own. All in all, the best songs are ""Justify My love"" by Front line assembly, and ""Why's it so hard"" by Dead or Alive. KMFDM's cover of ""Material Girl"" sounds quite horrific, but rocks, but the worst song has to be Berlin's ""Live to tell"". Who wants to hear a one hit wonder from the 80s do a cover of Madonna anyway."
2,Either you like it or you don't!,"This tribute to madonna was o.k. I was really impressed with Holiday by Heaven 17, otherwise the rest was ???? Madonna should have done her own remixes!!!"
1,Tribute -> Insult,"This cd is one of the worst blind investments I have made on music. The selection of songs is good however the good about this album ends with that. The Vocalists are generally incapable of recreating the spark of Madonna songs much less bring anything new to these songs. The vocals are weak, the mixing and arrangement of instruments (flat and monotone remixes and arrangements) further drown the vocals. I think the CD overall is very amateur sounding. I am suprised that Madonna even let this get printed. I think this CD can not really be a tribute except for the fact that it once again proves why Madonna is Madonna and everyone else is not. The only bearable songs on the compilation are the ""Bed Time stories"", and ""Swim"". The remake of Frozen destroys the song altogether, and is a definite career stopper for whoever did it.I have yet to see such a terrible attempt at remixing a group of musical intellectual material."
4,"Excellent ""Industrial"" Representation of Madonna's songs","Yup, that's what this album is mostly about -- an Industrial take on Madonna's clever songs. This is the sort of album that *grows* on you!!!It is quite interesting to see how the different artistes interpret some of these songs. I don't think it's fair to compare it to the way Madonna orginally did these songs. It has a very late-90's feel. Quite brilliant.My favorite tracks are (in the following order):12. Swim (Spahn Ranch) 1. Holiday (Heaven 17) 9. Material Girl (KMFDM) -- very freaky! 2. Like a Prayer (Loleatta Holloway) 8. Bad Girl (James Hardway)"
3,I love Industrial,"Any CD that has Front Line Assembly or KMFDM in it needs to be a part of my collection.I like the Immaculate Collection of Madonna's and I couldn't find anything wrong with this cd - but imagine hard core Madonna lovers may find this a bit out of listening range. Since I'm more of an Industrial Phreak, I found this cd to be a great additon to my 500+ cd's ! I like things that are innovative and different, and this definitely is."
2,EWWWWWWWWWW!,"I originaly bought the album because I heard the Gene Loves Jezebel mix, wich is absolutely fab and the only reason this album got 2 stars. I thought the rest would be just as good. Was I wrong! The renditions are very unimaginative and offensive to the ear. Which is a major dissapointment because I love most of the artists. I would suggest not buying this album."
4,Remember the time.....,This album aided in my first heart breakTrue love not meant to beNow it aids me in my questListen to the wordsMakes sense of the mess
5,A Band That Could Have Been.,"I was 14 when I bought Broadcast in 1987. I had never heard a song like ""(I Just) Died In Your Arms"" before nor have I since. I must have overdosed on the tape in the summer of '87, exposing it to all my friends, who in turn, bought Broadcast. Now, 13 years later, I listen again, and it still has a nice upbeat sound to it. All 10 tracks are great, there's no album filler. In 1989, Cutting Crew released their second cd The Scattering, which is just as good as Broadcast. Unfortunately, no one paid attention to The Scattering and the Cutting Crew faded from view. I guess it's living testimony to the quality of an album if anyone still likes to listen to it more than a decade later. Those of us who enjoyed the Cutting Crew have a nice secret--an album that wasn't played to death by a band that didn't play on well after their prime. Buy this cd, it's worth the money."
4,This Crew Got Screwed,"Laugh though you may, this has been one of my favorite albums of the past 10 years. Maybe some of that has to do with my nostalgic feelings for 80s music, I don't know. But, I'm telling you, it's a good album. For some reason, their record company decided to promote the lamest track on the album, and the band ultimately went the way of Kajagoogoo, etc."
5,What Ever Happened?,What ever happened to the great ones? Dream Academy? Crowded House? more recently Toad the Wet Sprocket? Why do all of the amazing groups seem to slip quietly under the radar never again to shine their light on the world... only exposing themselves to those who purposly seek them out?Cutting Crew is one of these bands and this album (Broadcast)is nothing short of perfection. The dripping wet melodies and engaging lyricism invade your soul in a fashion so very few could ever possibly achieve.In a word... spiritual....
4,Great Album.,"I have listened to my tape of this album many times over the past ten years, and I really enjoy it. The music is relaxing, and the lyrics are well written. I would have liked to have seen more come from this band. Now I am ready to purchase the CD, because my tape is worn out! I don't think there is a bad song on the entire album. It's too bad not all albums are that way."
5,GREAT BAND - GREAT CD!!!!,"For me this was one of the best CDs of 1987, this is a MUST.From beginning to end you really enjoy it every single song.I had it on tape, when this whole era of cds came, I bought their Greatest Hits, but it is not the same you gotta have this one."
5,An Absolute Gem,"This is by far my favorite album to come from the 80's, perhaps ever. If one listens carefully to the two most popular tracks, ""Been in love before"" and ""Died in your arms"",that person will discover a very gifted and talented lead guitarist. He is definitely up there with the likes of Eddie Van Halen and Eric Clapton. The songs on the album mostly depict about a young man's search for meaning of life. Although the band is no longer performing, their music still lives on in my car and home."
5,Oh! The 80's!,"This was my favorite album when it was released way back when. I Just died In Your Arms was my favorite song. Cutting Crew's music was mixing the new wave sound of the early decade with the hard rock acts that came along later that decade, like Bon Jovi and Motley Crue. All the songs have those great synths and guitars. The singer's voice is amazing. Any true fan of 80's pop rock must own this album. It is a tried and true classic."
3,Be aware that AMSCO dont pay attention to what they tab,"Beware when purchasing any AMSCO books that tab AC/DC.... some are correct, but alot, infact TOO MANY are tabbed incorectly... i dont just mean there in wrong positions... i mean they havent even tabbed the same song... its half and half with this book... half the songs are ok and correct.... half are bad and sloppy...dont pay any more then $10 for this. There is too much that is incorect. AMSCO dont even take the time to realise they have incorect tabs, because there still putting the same WRONG tabs into there latest books! Avoid AMSCO, or dont pay alot."
3,"Solid Effort, Would Prefer More New Material","Although six of the ten tracks here were previously released on albums from Singletary's old label Giant, there's a bit of worth on Singletary's first Audium release. Of larger interest is the classy rendition of Savage Garden's ""I Knew I Loved You,"" done with as much aplomb as Mark Chesnutt's popular cover of ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."" That and the sad remeniscence of ""I Thought of Everything"" are the best of the new tracks. Everything on Now and Again is as solid as Singletary's robust traditional country reputation. And the previously released songs, from the first hit ""I Let Her Lie"" to the underrated gem ""The Note,"" make this a good introduction (or re-introduction) to Daryle Singletary."
2,"Don't buy these gloves--cheap materials, poorly-stitched, ill-fitting","I'm a frequent Amazon user, but I've never felt compelled to leave a review until now. This is the first time I've been really disappointed with a purchase, but these gloves are pretty terrible, even at this price:-One of them is noticeably larger than the other.-Stitching is awful--the interior lining of one glove was never stitched into place, so looks like I'm going to have to fix that myself on a pair of NEW gloves I just purchased.-The dark purple cuffs look like leather--they're not! They're made from cheap, thin fabric. These gloves were assembled using the minimum amount of leather possible, then described as leather work gloves.Spend a little extra and get something better, or spend $5 at the hardware store and get something that you don't expect to last anyway. I'm going to keep these crappy gloves since I need work gloves for a class fairly soon, but in different circumstances, I would consider returning them."
5,duane eddy,one of my favorite albumns from back in the day its good to know that u can still get this great musictoday
3,Amazon messed up!,"I bought this CD years ago at some kitchenware store in a outlet mall. While Amazon has the titles right, the last song on the MP3 list is NOT correct when you play it. Instead of Bach's Air on G string, amazon's sample plays Pachelbel's Canon In D which is already on the CD."
3,Back cover not practical,"In theory, this is a nice clipboard. I've had two problems: (1) The actual clip popped off the base and I had to superglue it back on. (2) The clear cover on the back just hangs loose. I bought some Velcro squares to affix the bottom two corners. I would think the company would have figured this out first."
1,Dissapointed,"Dissapointed!! Back sheet tore in first week and the clip for the clipboard separated. Would not recommend. Working on a refund.,,"
5,Works great - but takes a couple of days before results are seen,"We have active dogs and live in a rural location where they can chase ground-squirrels and rabbits through brushy areas. As this seems to be a particularly bad year for ticks, we decided to invest in this product as it had good reviews. At first I was concerned because for two days after application I was still finding ticks on the dogs. Then poof! No more ticks showed up on the dogs. I do not know how effective it is on fleas, as we had not noticed any fleas on our dogs prior to using the product. We applied it almost a month ago, and the dogs are still tick-free. We will definitely be purchasing more of this product."
4,Television At It's Best,"As with the other folks above, I remember watching Crime Story each week during it's two years on the air. It made TV bearable for a little while; remember, this show came in the days of such ""classics"" as Who's the Boss and The A-Team. The last couple of episodes of season one blew me away; a story arc that lasted a season with all the loose ends being tied up in an finale that was definitely unconventional.I own the boxed VHS set from Starmaker. Although it is nice to have the entire run in one collection, the picture quality leaves something to be desired. Also, it is nearing the end of it's shelf life (the average for VHS is about 15 years) so a DVD set would be very welcome.Thanks to Anchor Bay for taking the time to put this gem back on the market and here's hoping they release the rest of the series."
4,"A dark, rockin', guns 'n' chrome story.","From the chase up Lake Shore Drive in dueling '59 Ford squad cars, to the heat of Lt. Torello's stuffy office, this is one mesmerizing movie. The music, clothes, dialogue, action - everything comes together to present a wacked-out look at the greasers in the Chicago Outfit in the early 1960's and the good guys in black suits and thin ties who chased them."
4,Crime Story,"While I am a transplant to Chicaga (the way the locals say it) the 'real' feel of the locations seep into this video. The main characters of Ray Luca and Mike Torello join in a pas de deux of crime and justice. Luca is amoral, staying strictly focused on making money as easily as possible, while Torello is so squarely on the line between good and evil that when he walks, one foot lands on the good side and the other foot lands on the side of evil. It is this conflict that generates and develops the characters. Michael Mann has succeeded in adapting Film Noire to Color. The pilot is a great lead in to the rest of the series, and was years ahead of the quality storylines of the Sopranos. The only way it could be better was if the rest of the series was also on DVD."
5,Blues Clues Holiday a review,"My kids love this book. It has activities that are simple and fun for small kids to do. The cookies that the kids made even came out well. Even if you don't do the activities, the book is just sweet and cute and teaches the kids about the different holidays that are celebrated in winter."
1,"Don't buy it, ridiculous teachings!","This book tries to oversimplify the meaning of holidays in December for children. By doing this, it actually changes the meaning of the holidays, and I think adds more confusion than just explaning the real meanings. Christmas is not the celebration of ""birth"", it is the celebration of Jesus's birth. I don't know anyone who goes to a hospital to celebrate birth, or hangs diapers and rattles on their house on December 25th. I think kids might confuse babyshowers or birthdays with ""Christmas"", and eventually parents will have to explain the real meaning anyways. There is nothing politically incorrect about printing the name Jesus in a book, or accurately portraying the real meaning behind Christmas. Because some people don't choose to acknowledge it, doesn't mean the meaning of Christmas changes, or it is offensive say the name Jesus. GOOD GRIEF!"
1,Terrible,This book has so many typos that it is unreadable. You will be much better off if you save your money and get Tannenbaum'sModern Operating Systemswhich is a dense tome but will actually teach you about operating systems instead of being a poorly edited glossary of terms about operating systems.
3,"Mediocre book, disappointing","I was looking for a rigorous review to supplement my Operating Systems course and I found that this book certainly fell short of that. I wanted more practice for the kinds of questions we would get on exams, but many of the topics addressed were treated at too simplistic of a level.I also would have have preferred a range of examples dealing with topics like semaphores and mutual exclusion, deadlock, file systems, but instead all the sample questions were disappointing and I found myself actually wasting time with this book. It would have been more productive to have just stuck with the textbook. Usually Schaum's does a good job, but I think they seriously fell short with their Operating Systems book."
3,great tool,I never used an electric tool for sheet metal but I am glad I did buy this one. I only do sheet metal work occasionally and this is a great tool for what I do. It is used but looks like new to me. Shipping was quick.
3,It's Ok but the good ones are somewhere else,"I thought most of these readings were interesting, but only about 15 of them were a possibility to read in front of my guests. These I found in many other sources. So, it's OK but you get more for your money in some other compilation books."
4,An interesting look into the rules of monkhood!,"Benedict, having dropped out of university because he viewed the life there as degenerated, goes into the bush and makes his abode in a crack in the side of a mountain. Upon coming out he writes the moral code for the next 1,400 years! This is that code or set of rules.Some of the book is dry - namely the end of it which goes over seating arangements for meals and other architectural details but the historical end of it is interesting and so are his guidelines for clean living in a monastic setting (which one can employ almost anywhere with the right focus)."
4,Good reading.,"The first half of this book should be read by every person in the country. He does a real nice job of explaining federal debt and how we place value on things.The second half of the book seemed a little over the top to me though. It sounds good to stockpile loads and loads of goods as tangible wealth, but it really is out of reach of most people."
5,redemption,"what an uplifting film! - despite the harrowing personal tragedy Christoff encounters, his transformation at the end is truly stunning, which left me amazed and encouraged at the grace and strength of this flawed man."
3,Prague,"The film dragged. Two tragic situations with the star of the film Mads Mikkelsen at the same time... The same level of emotional drama does not make a good film. Mads is an excellent actor, but his character needed a change in drama to make his character really work more effectively.. Other support actors were excellent."
1,poor acting,"the acting in this film was very poor, slow moving got boring.ALSO DID'NT LIKE THE SEXDON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
4,"Great Acting, Great Scenery and Atmospherics, Ordinary Story","Mads Mikkelsen is great as always. The story has been told a thousand times. A married couple is forced by fate into unfamiliar and deeply painful circumstances that demand emotional honesty from them for the first time in years. She's in love with a younger man, he has long-known it but never said so until now. Slowly they both come to understand that the only glue between them is a child and a lot of sadness. It's a very good but not a great film."
4,For the Mads fan,"This is not his best but for Mads Mikkelsen fan, this is good enough. It is more of a chick flick."
5,Lighthouse lamp,The lamp in question met or exceeded my expectations. I have a travel trailer and we are decorating it with lighthouses. The lamp fits right into the decorations we already have and an asset to the interior of the travel trailer. The small bulb that we use in the lamp gives off a soft glow and makes the interior seem very homey and cozy. This is a plus when we are camping in it and makes it seem like we have brought home with us. I highly recommend anyone to buy this lamp if they like lighthouses and want a soft touch to the decor.
1,Not what I thought,When the add says you can create your own puzzle it would make one think that you could create your own puzzle with your own clues ect. In actuality you can only change the shape of generated puzzles.
5,Best flea and tick med I have found.,After trying about every thing on the market I keep coming back to Advantix.No other product will keep ticks off for as long as advantix. My dogs have not experienced any ill effects as some of the reviews have said.
3,"If you want to hear the original version, buy ""Country""","Listen to the old 1984 soundtrack of ""Country"" and you can hear ""The Rules of Engagement."" It's also on other Mark Isham recordings, including ""On the Threshold of Liberty"" on the 1984 Windham Hill Records Sampler. Yes, it's a totally derivative work! If you've heard it once, you've heard it before... just recycled... Who's fooling who here?"
2,Disappointed,"I read all the positive reviews and looked forward to reading ""Radical Hospitality."" I had hoped that this would be a book addressing Benedictine hospitality in a style similar to Father Timothy Gallagher's excellent guides to Ignatian spirituality. Based on the book's description and reviews, I expected ""Radical Hospitality"" to explain how Benedictine rule can be applied practically to one's own life to better develop the virtue of hospitality. It is not. The book's conversational, rambling style is easy enough to read, but I found it lacking in the kind of substance that inspires reflection and action. Anecdotes, generalizations, and flowery writing abound. Clarity of purpose does not.As a Catholic Christian, the statement that the Eucharist has such power because ""it is founded in our food experience"" and ""food is powerful"" finally prompted me to give up on ""Radical Hospitality."" The Eucharist is powerful because it is Jesus Christ."
3,Pastors pet project,"The Rector of our church at the time wanted everyone to read the book and respond to it in our""real life"". It was met witha cool reception."
5,Just the best,"J. Strauss - Die FledermausI have been chasing this version for ages.Should have gone to Amazon in the first place as one always deals with this most trusted organization.I first saw this version originaly on Laser Disc(remember these)and it was just superb.Strauss himself would have enjoyed this version it is simply the best,and I have just placed my order with Amazon.Please note at the time of this review they only have 1 copy left so be quick.As a Film Producer I feel one can speak with some authority regarding production etc.and this is simply the best you will see.Icannot for the love of me understand how some people are critical of this particular production,perhaps some folks just love having feet that run swiftly to criticism. NOT TO BE MISSED.!!Thomas Knight,Wintergarden Film(Aust)"
3,Disappointing,"This is a lame performance compared to the Royal Opera one with Kiri Te Kanawa and Hermann Prey. This version has a leading lady who does not understand her character, and a husband who acts and sings as if he were her father. Costumes and sets are average, sound quality is great. After watching this Deutsche Grammophon verson, I truly appreaciated the fabulous performance of the Royal Opera and its main characters' joie de vivre, their performance is like musical champagne, while this production never even had the fizz or it went flat long time ago."
1,guitar case too small,"I measured my guitar carefully, and it appeared to fit exactly into the case except for one problem: the inside of the case is so full of fluffy, plush, lining that it was too bulky to comfortably fit the guitar in. I can CRAM it in with pressure on the sides, but not sure that is good for the guitar. So I decided to return the pretty case. It cost me $45 to send it back via UPS with the return label. That was very disappointing. Otherwise, I would have liked the guitar case which seemed well made and sturdy."
4,Almost Flawless,"Side one is nice but somewhat forgetable.Side two is 100% perfection.1. Everybody Loves You 2. Take Your Time 3. Days 4. Song of SevenIt doesn't get any better than this. Remember when LP's would only hold about 17-20 minutes of music per side? Well thank goodness this was released before they started packing 15-18 songs on each newly released cd. This perfectly conceived side two would have been blended with 3-4 filler songs that would have ruined the experience.Remember, much of the time less is more. That's why it is so hard to listen to any new cd all the way through without programing.This release was at the right place at the right time. One of Jon's finest moments outside of YES."
4,DISCOVERIES OF LIGHT,"""Met me a stranger, he came here today bearing gifts full of promises, discoveries of light"". Anybody you know? Rest assured after one run-through you'll thereafter be cranking up the volume and wiping a tear from your eye every time you hear the driving opening chords to those words. Not as lofty and ethereal as his previous masterpiece (Olias) but plenty of energy to recharge your spiritual batteries, particularly in the opening number (For You For Me) and the album's second half."
1,disapointed,"disapointed in this album, I herd all of the album felt likemaybe the next song will be better but it wasn't Wish I couldreturn it. Album music songs are not consistant with otherAnderson work."
1,Beyond Rating System!,"How can I describe infinity and beauty combined? Not at all, and that's the essence of play and childhood doings contained here in SONG OF SEVEN -One centimeter of this work of Jon Anderson's cannot be taken away and analyzed, in my humble opinion. This is why generations pass knowledge on, perhaps. SO7 is simply beyond this rating system. I leave it at that."
5,Gone To Heaven,"This is an amazing CD from the frontman of the group, Japan! Although a few songs were cut out from the LP to accomodate it to CD length, it is still great! Perfect for camoing out under the southwestern skies, perferably on the side of El Capitan, or anywhere that you envision as the place of perfect relaxation. Not to be missed."
4,Gone to Earth keeps me grounded,"I have loved this album since I first bought it on vinyl in the eighties. David Sylvian is a musical genius. Soothing, yet eclectic, it's a good listen anytime."
2,...,"This is where i lost all interest in David Sylvian's solo career..or almost. While he has certainly produced some great stuff both with Japan, solo or in collaboration with others, I personally was no longer able to follow him on the intimate journey he chose. Sorry."
5,A long-buried treasure resurfaces,"I was ecstatic to hear the entire album has been transferred to CD at last. I've long been a fan of the original vinyl and had refused to buy the previous CD issue due to some of my favorite tracks having been deleted for time. So I welcome this new edition with open arms. The first cut I played was the re-mix of Coyote Camp, which sounds richer, fuller and more eerie than on the original LP. Why this treasure was buried for time was beyond my comprehension. It was one of my favorites on the LP. I'll have to play the LP and CD back to back to notice little nuances about which I was reading on this site, regarding the piano sound on ""Laughter and Forgetting"", but it's a labor of love I'm looking forward to. God bless Virgin for finally doing the right thing."
1,Doesn't hold up,I bought these in 2005. The louvers are wooden and slide into a groove in the frame so they are fragile and break easily. I am replacing mine in 2011 with a solid wooden grate with a metal louver beneath from another company.
4,Exactly what I wanted,"I bought a few of these to replace my current out dated rusted registers and they look exactly as pictured. I'm giving this a 4 star mainly because one of them was a lot lighter in color compared to the rest, but other than that, well made product."
4,Perfect fit and almost-perfect color,"I bought this for my mom, who lives several hours away. The first one I ordered was the wrong size--I requested a return and the shipping company was at her door the next day. On day 3, the correct sized item (this one) arrived and she is VERY happy. She tells me it is a perfect fit, works exactly as she wants it to and is only slightly lighter in color than the quarter-sawn oak floor. We are very happy and will definitely purchase this product again, should she need more. I gave it 4 stars only because it hasn't been in use long enough to judge how well it's going to hold up."
1,Not a good choice when there are babies or toddlers in the house,"I was getting these floor registers expressly for baby-proofing our house. I intended to screw them into our hardwood floor, so that our little one wouldn't be able to pull them out. I was willing to put a metal screen under the damper box to catch anything that our little one would throw down the vents.Alas, the workmanship on these vents is so poor that they are unusable for us. Specifically, the edges of the slanted ribs are extremely sharp. They were not rounded over and sanded smooth before finishing. Imagine a toddler sticking his fingers in there. Also, the surfaces of the ribs haven't been sanded at all, it seems, and are very rough. They are also not finished.Having said that, I assume that these vent covers will work fine when there are no adventurous kids around."
5,Insightful and engaging study of Heaney's works,"A fresh and comprehensive critique of all of Seamus Heaney's work to date: poetry, prose and translations, traces his development as a writer and his influences, inspirations and the cultural context of his work. Well-written, engaging and insightful."
4,That close to perfection,"In the age of double sets, it's almost as if a single CD just won't do any artist justice anymore. In the case of 'The King' this is less of a problem, given the amount of demos and live bootlegs on the market.Since they've priced the one-disc, 23 track 'Memphis Record' just a tad higher than this one, you're just as well to buy this, but if you can find it used, stick with it instead. Most of the demos contained in this anthology are good, but not essential. It's really the first disc that amazes, even after all these years.However, as amazing as this set is, I'm still [angry] that RCA hasn't seen fit to release it with that great blues version of 'Stranger in My Own Home Town,' which would be worth the price of the rest of the tracks."
2,"Nice try, RCA","For the fan who already owns the 60s box set, the question here is whether or not it's worth 25 dollars for the alternate takes on disc two. ""After Loving You"" has Elvis on piano, ""You'll Think of Me"", ""Without Love"", and ""Power of My Love"" are basically the offical mixes sans horn and backup singer overdubs. A couple of the other alternake takes are interesting for their slightly different arrangements. Is it all worth 25 dollars? No. RCA strikes again. If these songs are what you're after, buy the 60s box- more pricey but well worth it for these songs and EP's overlooked early 60s tracks with Boots Randolph on saxophone."
2,Great Music Poorly Presented,"The music on this CD is terrific, but the mix and remastering are surprisingly poor. Not only are the mixes bizarrely primitive--instruments thrown hard right or left--but the remastering itself sounds muffled and indistinct. I was very disappointed.Skip this and hope DCC secures the right to issue the same material on gold disc."
5,MUST HAVE CD!,"TO ME ,THIS WAS THE BEST MATERIAL ELVIS EVER RECORDED.HE SEEMED TO PUT MORE INTO THESE SONGS THAN HE EVER HAD BEFORE OR EVER WOULD AGAIN.THE AWESOME BOOKLET THAT COMES WITH IT TELLS YOU WHY.THE PRODUCER,CHIPS MOMAN,GOT ELVIS TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO IT AND IT SHOWS.UNFORTUNATELY,THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY RECORDINGS ELVIS DID AT AMERICAN STUDIOS.WHAT A SHAME.AS FOR AS THE ELVIS DOUBLE CD'S GOES,THIS AND THE MEMORIES '68 COMEBACK SPECIAL ARE THE BEST YOU CAN GET."
3,Tale of an overly-ambitious man,"Robb MacDaniel has his life all planned when a tragic accident changes everything. His parents are killed and he inherits enough money to go to law school instead of becoming a teacher as he intended. He puts off his marriage to his high school sweetheart and his entire life takes a different turn. The author makes it very plain (no pun intended) that Robb's pursuit of money and prestige inevitably leads to his downfall. The characters in this book are not as finely drawn or as sympathetic as many in Plain's other books and her message is pretty obviously made, but it's not a bad read."
2,A Laborious Read,"I have always enjoyed Belva Plain's books, so ""Fortune's Hand"" was a big disappointment. I labored through this book, hoping it would get better, but believe me, it doesn't. The setting felt artificial. I never grew to like ANY of the characters. The dialogue was stilted (No one has talked like this in at least 50 years!) and why are so many ""words"" and ""phrases"" placed in ""quotation marks""? The sub-plot about the shame of having a retarded son was offensive and very dated. This book is supposed to take place in the 1970s-1990s, but the plot and the characters never felt true to the times. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this forgettable book."
4,"Relax for a while with a ""good read""","Robb McDaniel has his life all planned out. He will marry his high school sweetheart, Lily, teach at the high school and maybe eventually become the school principal. But suddenly, after a tragic car accident in which his parents are killed, he is able to have enough money to go to law school. And that's when everything changes for them.While Robb goes to law school, Lily stays in their hometown, works at the library and waits for him to graduate so they can be married. But Robb meets Ellen Grant, falls in love with her, marries her and becomes a partner in her father's law firm.They have 2 children, a daughter and then a much longed for son. But as time goes on, Robb becomes more and more involved in his work and getting ahead and Ellen is left to face some unique problems alone.FORTUNE'S HAND is fascinating in that it shows how a person can completely be taken over by ambition and greed and what happens to the family left behind."
3,An easy to read escape novel,"This book starts out well with the underprivileged country boy (Robb MacDaniel) deciding to change his life (and unfortunately the life of his long-time sweetheart) by going to law school. After becoming a successful attorney and, at the same time, throwing out his childhood belief system, he becomes a man who is misunderstood by those closest to him. The best part of this novel is the collateral storyline of the struggle Robb and his wife face with their developmentally challenged child. You want the child and family to find a quiet balance, but in the end the reader may just feel deflated and let down."
1,Awful,"I read Evergreen many years ago (and thoroughly enjoyed it), this was the first Belva Plain book I had picked up since - what a mistake! It was the worst book I have read in a long time. The characters were unlikeable, no worthy traits whatsoever and the character development was very poor. The timeline of the story didn't hold any meaning either - it was set in the 1970's to late 1990's, there was no evidence of this at all, it could have been 1870's with the way Robb expressed himself. Old fashioned, questionable sentiments and POOR story! Don't bother picking this one up!"
2,Boring,"I liked the story for the first 50 pages, but after that it kept getting boring. I have read other books by Belva Plain and I have to say that this was the one that I liked the least. Her stories begin to develop a pattern and her style of writing is no longer exciting. I wouldn't suggest reading this book unless there isn't another one within 10 miles."
2,Not one of her best,"I have always been a Belva Plain fan. I couldn't wait for her books to be published! After having read her latest two: ""Fortune's Hand"" and ""After the Fire"", I'm disappointed! Both of these books are just not up to her earlier works. I can't put my finger on it: is it the characters, the plots, the writing? They just left me with a blah feeling."
3,Predictable and tired plot but with non-typecast characters,"On reading the synopsis of the book, I formed my own expectations and predictions of the book and rather to my disappointment, they were more or less accurate. The story is predictable and the plot, tried-and-tested before: a man, who in his greed for more, makes reckless decisions and risks, his downfall is predictable. The only thing I find interesting is that the characters in the books are not typecast. Robb, for instance, is not ruthless in his quest for wealth, as we would have presumed most people of such nature would be. Instead, he is portrayed as a gentlemen, with a heart for the underdogs. Here, it does not make me close the book with a 'serve you right' at the end, but instead, I finished the book with a sigh, sympathising with him, even though I knew, almost right from the start, how he would end up to be."
3,Not Her Best Work.,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I normally enjoy her books and typically spend my reading time rooting for the hero or heroine to resolve whatever the issue is (spousal abuse in Whispers). I did not even feel sorry for Robb McDaniel. I thought his wife was stupid to stay with him for so long. Then miraculously one day she realizes what he is, calls her kids shrink and moves in with him because they have known for several years that they loved each other but they couldn't act on it until she leaves her husband - who has already cheated on her several times and has mortgaged their whole lives. Whatever!"
2,Promises more than it delivers,"It was so disappointingly predictable and ""boilerplate"". I suppose, afterall, how many different ways can you describe a romance and marriage, with all its many forks in the road. ""Evergreen"" was the first Belva Plain book I ever read and it spoiled me for the rest. That book truly captured my heart."
4,Another Belva Plain winner!,"Even though the ""outcome"" for Robb was somewhat predictible, I really enjoyed the smooth flow of this book. I did, however, wish that more of Lily's life would have been included and followed throughout the story. For awhile I was afraid that she wasn't going to be mentioned until the very end. My thanks to Belva Plain for continuing to write such successful and enjoyable material!"
2,not worth the book price,"I got Fortune's Hand from the library on a whim. I have never read Belva Plain. This book had no action or excitement for me. I did, however, finish it. I am happy that Ellen found her true love in the end. Plain's old titles don't look interesting either."
1,Not enough character inter action,This book didn't go together well. We meet Lily in the begining but don't get to follow her life in parallel with Robbs. It would have been nice to see some more of her life.
2,disappointed,"The title and subtitle promised something this book did not deliver. As I kept reading and reading waiting for the ""Wonder to be proclaimed"" that science provides, I realized that the only wonder I would have is why I bought this book at all. The writer too seems to be an evangelical feminist, which again had me again ask ""why?"""
5,A Wonderful First Collection,"This is an amazing book of Miss Parnell's poetry... a perfect start to what better be a long career in writing. Lush, romantic imagery... sometime lusty, sometimes natural... sometimes humorous... but always passionate and with the strength only a Southern lady could imbue it all with. Miss Parnell has a true gift with words and lacing them up together in a way to produce rich and memorable images. This book has a definite place of honor on my desk. (Some favorite poems of mine from the book are - ""Moon Chat"", ""Maple Leaf"", ""The Bay"" and ""The Crescent Moon's Crowning"".)"
4,New-school meets Old-school,"At first glance Breed 77 seems to be one of the many and not so distinguishable nu-metal acts, with their name, and strange artwork. But once you listen to the album it becomes clear that these 5 guys from Gibraltar, England, are not just your run of the mill boring, indistinguishable new act. In their self titled debut album Breed 77 manages succesfully to blend melodic old-school like, Soundgarden and Alice in chains. With heavy new-school such as, Ill nino and Soulfly. All in all this is a great album that is worthy of praise. Fans of heavier acts such as Soulfyl, Ill Nino and other such bands can come together with fans of mellower bands like Nickleback and Creed, as this album produces songs both sets of fans will no doubt enjoy. Best songs; 2)Rise, 5)Karma, 7)Final Prayer and 10)Eyes That See."
4,looks good and also good for the price,"consider the misfortune of the other reviewer, i am lucky to have received it in just a few days.given it is bought at $3.50 with free shipping, it is pretty good! it is not as refined as other brands but can't really tell from a distance anyway. i think it looks good and is a good bargain"
2,didn't like,Not very good quality and keeping them straight was a pain. I am guessing by plus sized they meant 3lbs overweight.
1,disappointment,"hello - i ordered the painter of light puzzle of a lighthouse. if you look at my order you will see very clearly that i ordered a puzzle of a lighthouse. everywhere you look you will see i ordered a puzzle of a lighthouse. however, i got a puzzle of what i figure is a gazebo. it is a nice puzzle, but i wanted the lighthouse puzzle. so i am very disappointed and needless to say will never order from these people again. i don't know if there is some sort of a trick question here but i wanted the LIGHTHOUSE PUZZLE NOT THE GAZEBO. oh and i will not be sending the gazebo puzzle back cause i am not going to be bothered with all that goes with returning. and no rating"
4,Very nice,I really liked The Stranger in Us. The casting was interesting and the story was something we can all relate to sometime in our life. I would like to hear what other think.
5,PETERS VS GRISHAM,"It's not even close. In 2 Chapters of this novel Peters manages to do what Grisham failed to do in his booklet BLEACHERS---tell an interesting football story that is surrounded by human interest and personal moments in the context of the world the characters live in. I had no idea there was a football story in this Elvis book and it was exciting. You'll really root for the kids and enjoy growing up with them hanging around Elvis. The rest of the book is Elvis like never before. It reads like a great fiction novel, very warm and close to the subject. The look the reader gets at Elvis is very unique and I would reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys an interesting and emotional read."
4,Nice tool but not what I need,A handy tool to have but not the one that worked for the job I needed it for. It was returned.
1,Bad Re-recordings Not The Original Versions,"The two big hits here, Happiest Girl in the USA and Funny Face, are atrocious re-recordings. I don't know if that is true of all the songs, but I bet they are not the originals either. Some of the other songs on the CD like Do I Love You and That Was Yesterday are ones that I wanted to add to my collection.I wish the Consumers Bureau or somebody could stop these rip-offs."
4,Excellent for Podcasting,We purchased this mixer after a bit of research and it is working out well for our 4 person podcast. The only complaint falls in line with everyone else: the power chord is way too loose. Every little bump and the thing comes busting out.
2,great mixer with one major flaw,"everything about this mixer (and the other xenyx / eurorack mixers) makes it perfect for touring on a budget - - lightweight, inexpensive, and decent sound. the only problem, and i've heard this from so many people who use these mixers, is the power supply. after using my 1202FX for 6 months, on connecting the mixer to power, flames and smoke shoot out of the control room outputs, right above the ac adapter socket. and the power adapters are not availably separately! the logic being that since the mixer is so cheap, just buy an entirely new mixer in order to get a replacement power adapter. and i do. over and over. these mixers are disposable, that's terrible. but they work great! so gamble."
3,Excellent sounding product but watch out..,"This mixer does exactly what I needed for a small combo gig. Still, I have my concerns about the power supply. The small plug came loose and I could not tell where the problem was until after I shut down everything else, then realized is was the mixer. This item is still new and I would hate to use tape to keep the plug secure. This could be a deal breaker. I may need to try a different mixer."
5,Great little mixer,"This is a great product for a low price. It has good audio bandwidth (10->100KHz), very low noise. Sounds great, and the effects processor is cool. If you need a really good mixer/mic preamp for your home theater, just starting out band, church, or other $$ sensitive organization this is a great buy. I am using it for the home and digital audio circuit experimentation.I like the crystal clear, clean audio response along with the very quite(low noise) microphone preamps. Looks really good on O'scope, sound is even better."
4,head phone jack quit,"Sure I looked at the decription to see what all it did what connections it had tosee if it wold work but when I got the box and opened it I was wow what is this dinky thing, I hooked it upto my pc, my amp monitors and I was smooth blown away it is out standing for a small venue im seriously impressed, I was less than impressed with the shipping time, I'm use to things getting here in two to three days from amazon it took one day short of the dead line but it did make it intime. a month into having it and using it the head phone jack quit"
5,better than expected,"I received this it was a demo, heck it was brand spanking new, and what a good deal i got. I am more than happy with my behringer 1202 fx, all i can say is thank you, thank you, thank you."
2,Dead after less than a year,"Considering the price is so cheap on these, I took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. To say that I used it ""rarely"" is an understatement - maybe once a month when I have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vDrums and a bass DI through my powered wedges. That said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume ALL the way up.Aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. However, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.Pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero."
2,Good when in the first hour or so,"The sound is as expected when it's working. However, after about an hour or so of running, the mixer would output distorted noise. It sounds exactly as if the the source volume is too loud and is clipping all the time, only the output volume is actually very low. At first I thought my cables were defective, but no matter how many cables I switch, it works good for awhile then start to have same problem. I didn't start attributing it to the mixer itself until several month later. Now, whenever it does this, all I have to do is cut the power to the mixer and plug it back and problem goes away...for another 30 min - 1 hour."
4,Behringer 1202FX,Unit was purchased through Amazon and sent By Beach Camera.I was sent a used unit and sent it back. Will not buy buy anything fromAmazon sold by Beach Camera.Unit is a great little piece. Would highly recommend it to anyone. I purchased somewhere else.Ronnie LankfordVirginia
2,Terrible Reverb!!!!,"Im a pro singer and this has the very worst reverb ive ever had from any equipment. IF YOU ARE A SINGER, STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!!!"
4,Great mixer with its on set of faults,"The blue LED on this thing is really blindingly bright. I hate Blue LEDS, but this is quite easily the brightest one I've got. I wear glasses and I can't even see the board powered on. Not having a power switch is all kinds of suck: Behringer could have put one in. The Effects are kind of novel most are some variant of echo, or channel switching."
4,Great Mixer for Podcasting,"I've only had this mixer a short time, but so far I'm loving it. For $100 you can't beat the features. I use it for Podcasting and it seems to have everything I need. I prefer my mixers at an Incline, so I wish it angled toward me, but I can make a stand for that.I also bought a Behringer UFO202 USB Interface to plug in to my computer via USB and the 2 of them work great together. The one thing I noticed was that it comes with 99 effects, but nowhere in the manuals that come with it does it list what each effect is. I did find a PDF online that list them though. Here's the link:[...]I would recommend this mixer if you are Podcasting, doing any home recording or need a mixer for your band to practice with."
4,Not a bad little mixer,"Behringer has had a somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so I was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit but so far, so good. The mic preamps sound pretty good - clean and relatively quiet. The knobs and slider feel smooth and well made.It also seems to send hotter signal to my JBL EON 510s and that's a good thing.The built-in effects are probably its weakest point. I've heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit.I also wish that the Control Room knob and outputs were independent of the Main Output slider. That would definitely make it a lot more practical but then again, it would also turn it into a 4 buss mixer. So all in all, not too shabby for a $110.00 mixer but I probably wouldn't use it for recording."
4,Behringer XENYX 1202FX Premium 12-Input 2-Bus Mixer,This is a very good product as most Berhringer items are. A lot of flexibility for the price. The only drawback is the lack of a power off/on switch. You can overcome this simply by plugging it in to an on/off extension cord.
2,Does not work after 6 months,Worked OK for few months. Now microphone line in does not work. Earlier it started making shaking sound. I would say that product has some nice features but it is cheap. It is not durable and quality is poor.
2,Good product but poor packing,"The mixer is good for the price but I had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside. The packing way below average. As a matter of fact, it was the only outer box without any cushioning. After seeing those UPS and FEDEX delivery videos I would not pack a UPS or FEDEX shipping item in such a poor packing. However, the great seller ( I am referring to AMAZON) immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit. Second unit too had the similar packing but no damages. Worked fine."
4,Boo!,"This game is great overall. The only problem I have is that you have to constantly click to move somewhere. No keyboarding whatsoever. But it was very scary. I fell out of my chair once or twice 'cause I got so scared. But then agin I get scared easily. I can't play Doom without screaming every 10 seconds and shaking, LOL!!!! Seriously. It's sad!"
3,Take your magnifying glass and shove it!!!,"The other reviews I read had it right.While this game does offer some satisfying puzzle problems,there are some which defy solution(I consider myself pretty good at these).The major gripe I have is that there are sooooo many spots which you have to look closely at(using the magnifying glass)which yield nothing and I mean lots of spots.Also, you collect many objects as you go,but trying to combine them is tricky.The great amount of time you spend opening doors and moving around searching for items(in especially dark locations)really grated on my nerves.I have played way better adventure games,the best being ""Keepsake""."
4,spoilers below,"Scratches is one of the best games I have played and definitely the saddest. It cannot be performed without the walkthrough, and here's the cool thing... Even with the walkthrough you still might not be able to get it. For anyone out there who didn't get it, HERE COMES THE SPOILER.Everything comes down to Robin. Hopefully I've said enough without the causual reader getting told everything (you've been warned), but it is how the mother died, the coverup, why the construction isn't finished,and why the room is bricked up. Read about the tribal god and you'll see what I mean- that's hidden somewhere too. So try it with the walkthrough and Still experience a great narrative- and still a bit of gameplay in figuring out the ending. Having an extensive background in Lovecraft anf Fulci never hurts either..."
3,Almost a total waste,"First let me just say I got this game as a gift from someone who bought it at CompUSA at sale price of $10. The first impression of the game was good, it has nice graphics that gives a dark and chilling feeling. Very soon it doesn't matter how good it looks, the game play was idiotic with very few options of using the objects in front of you."
3,Suprisingly creepy for low budget mis-adventure,"This game displays many reasons people cite for the downfall of adventure games..Dated graphics, frustrating linear gameplay in it's old school myst presentation, and on top of that it is way too short...Despite all of it's flaws, this game manages to shine in it's creepy atmospherics and semi engaging plot, offering a few genuine rare gaming moments of scares..The ending in particular is worth slogging through to..It is unfortunate today that the boundries between vision and execution fall so far apart in adventure games, since this particular genre has often the only games with substance, while their gameplay is completely lacking..Hopefully the bridges will become more secure between presenting an engaging, intellegent story inside of an interactive environment, as I would hate for every game out there to digress into a twitch-based bloodbath of pixels.."
1,slow and boring,"NO activity with another being. You also have to find objects in the correct order(frustrating). My wife and I really tried to like this but it was VERY tedious and slow. As for the gameplay and graphics, you'd think this game was made in the 90's."
2,Ok game but you're not going to get far without help,The game was ok. I liked the spooky Victorian atmosphere. But I didn't feel like there was a lot going on in the game. There were some creepy moments but nothing to make you wet your pants. And I couldn't get anywhere without getting an Internet walkthrough and I've heard a lot of people say the same.
3,boring,"I thought this game was a little boring and repetitive. Some of the small details were ridiculous. There wasn't as much to explore visually as I hoped. The ending was a joke!! The only reason I kept playing is because I thought it would eventually get better. I got bored searching the same old rooms. Some of the challenges were also quite boring. I would have paid $5.00 for this game, not $20.00."
2,Tedious,"My daughter and I played this game and if it wasn't for her persistence I would have quit it. We had to look up a walkthrough and had to use it several times. There is no way you could have figured out a few of the ""actions"" you had to take using your inventory. The game didn't guide you, but left you wandering around alot. We played it through to the end and I wanted to tell you...study the medical clues and the drawings. There is more to the story than the curse and insanity. Look closely at those vials and what they imply. If you want a good game, play ""Amber, Journey Beyond."" ""Scratches"" was a disappointment compared to playing this game."
4,Scratches - Flat ending,"This is a fun and challenging game. It builds nicely all the way up to the ending which is kind of flat. The end doesn't really draw all the strings of the game together with a clear understanding of what actually happened. It left me feeling that I needed to know more about all of the things suggested throughout the game. Like the photos showing people in victorian dress when it is set in modern times? Like what the doctor was actually doing all the years he stayed at the house? When was the wife killed? Who killed the wife? The baby? Did the maid ever really get away? What was the purpose of the large furnace? If there were secret passages that allowed the child to creep around the house, where were they? It just seemed like the developers ran out of steam at the end."
2,A throwback to the boring adventure games,"I feel misled by the positive reviews. I like adventure games when they are not all based on finding the right pixel to click on and when they are not soporific. Unfortunately, this is both. Frankly, it seems as if I'm back in the early '90's playing 7th Guest. The graphics are utterly disappointing, and very, very static. You constantly run into doors that all look the same and most of them are locked. The music is eerie, but so what. It seems there's nothing to do but open drawers, find ""useless junk"" or yet ""another old tarnished candelabrum"", or not very mysterious clues, or, at best, endless verbose journals that refer to a ""terror"" that is ""almost indescribable."" Lots of British accents, some better than others, couldn't keep me awake."
4,Great Surprise Ending,"""Scratches"" is a game about an up-and-coming writer who finds himself living in what appears to be a haunted, old victorian mansion. After learning about the murder that occurred there years before, and hearing the awful scratching noises late each night, he becomes obsessed with findng out the truth - whatever that is...The graphics of this game are quite realistic & there are several neat places to explore (mansion, old chapel, green house, crypt, garage, & garden). However, I found myself having to go to a walkthrough too many times - as there wasn't enough information given to let you know what to do next. This is why I have given ""Scratches"" 4 stars.Overall, if you like playing mystery games, I would recommend this game. But, be aware that you may need to find a good walkthrough to help you progress. (I used the walkthrough by UHS hints & found it to be quite useful)."
4,Needed a lot of help,"I'm still pretty new to these types of games, so I'm sure that someone that is used to them probably didn't have the same problem as me, but it seemed like I had to use a walkthrough an awful lot.The story is pretty interesting and weird. The graphics are nice looking, and there are times that you get chills on the back of your neck."
3,Made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end...,"This game is different. Requires a bottle of wine and a notepad. Turn the lights out. Crank up the audio. Prepare for some tedious searching and running back and forth, but that's what it's all about. Works in a psychological way that takes you by surprise. The puzzles (or things required to implement a logical progression of the story) make sense and work in your favor. It builds on you... takes you into its own little claustrophobic world, and begs you to solve its mystery. The ending works wonderfully if you pay attention to what its all about. The Blair Witch jolt comes to mind. Give in only if you like unsettling moments achieved through sheer, frustrated, mystery solving determination, and enjoy feeling those Goosebumps on your face."
4,The Kids Love It!,"This tent is huge ... I have two girls under 5 yrs. and they have been sleeping in it in the living room since we got it! Makes for a fun indoor camp night for them! It doesn't stand straight, though, kind of tilts to one side but they don't mind. Easy to fold down and put away too!"
4,Disney Princess House,"I bought this house for my daughter who is almost two and is obsessed with Disney Princess. It was by far her favorite gift she got for Christmas. She has tripped over the lip on the door many times, but other than that I have no complaints. She loves having her own house to play in and anytime she has friends over that is where they can be found. I would highly recommend this product as it is great for everyday play and even better for sleepovers!"
2,Great toy for young girls but hard to pack up.,This is a wonderful toy for your little princess. Ours loves it. It pops up and is very durable. The only problem is getting it back into the pack. It takes two men and a boy to maneuver it. That is my only complaint.
3,Princess Tent - a bit frustrating,"I set it up for hours of play at Grandma's house on Christmas day. When it came time to collapse it down 2 days later to take it home, I felt I need a PhD in Engineering to get it to break down properly. When I put it back up at home, it never really stood up straight. I've been tempted to return for one that's easier to breakdown & setup. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 5."
3,Birthday wish,...this was a present from my son to his granddaughter...she was pleased with it and says it's fun...I haven't seen it so I can not give a real review...but I did want to what info I have...so my info is incomplete...
1,Disappointed,"It was wonderful the first time we set the Playhut Disney Tent Castle up. However, after that, it always leaned or fell over. It never set up straight again no matter what we tried. we were so disappointed and so were our little grandaughters. We all became so frustrated with it. I will never purchase another product such as this one."
5,Great Dress Up Tent,"I purchased this Disney tent for my 5 year old daughter. We use it as her dress up tent. It is so big. It holds a makeup stand with mirror, a wooden toy bin organizer, and 2 huge tubs with dress up clothes in them. There is still room for 3-4 girls to play dress up in it. I love it."
3,Not for small babies,"This is a great castle. Me and my husband and my daughter can fit in it, but if you have limited space, this doesn't work. We have to put the castle up because it is too big for the house. I'm sure she will love it later on. My friend's baby crawled in there and it collapsed. It is not very sturdy or durable."
2,Would not recommend.,"Would not recommend if you are looking for a durable and easy to store away play house.This play house takes up a lot of room (would be good for parties, day care, or if you have plenty of space in the house). It drove me nuts trying to put it back together the way it came in. After 6 months of having it and even with the help of numerous adults, I still couldn't figure out how to store it away ""easily"". And after about five times of twisting and folding, the frame already went lopsided."
1,Unnecessary and Inhumane,"There is no reason on earth for this product to exist. Regardless on where one stands on the use of shock collars, invisible fencing, etc., teaching a down-stay to a dog is not rocket science. With this product, the dog is shocked when he ventures away from the bed. This in and of itself is unnecessary and inhumane. But add to that the fact that dogs associate things that happen concurrently, and you've got the makings of much bigger problems than a faulty ""stay."" The dog could easily be looking at, let's say, your child when he gets shocked, thus associating the two. This can set up a dangerous dynamic. Even if the dog is not looking at a particular person when receiving an electronic correction, this type of punishment could easily create fear or aggression issues. PLEASE consider simply training your dog instead of taking this seemingly easy way out. Training a solid down-stay is NOT very difficult, and you won't be risking creating much bigger problems."
1,Unnecessary & Possibly Dangerous,"There is no need whatsoever for a product like this. Teaching a dog a down stay is a very easy thing to do without need for punishment of any kind. If you are even considering a product like this, imagine the following scenario. A child approaches a dog on this mat and the dog gets up to greet them just as the child reaches for the dog. The dog is ""statically corrected"" (otherwise known as being shocked) and associates the shock with the child. The dog can become fearful of, or aggressive towards the child. There are several books and DVDs on Amazon that can safely help you teach a down stay to your dog without punishment. Please consider spending your money on them instead. If you are having problems with your dog, please consider the services of a good, qualified, trainer."
1,Dangerous Product,"As a Certified Professional Dog Trainer, I am rendered speechless at the thought of this inhumane product being offered on the market.One of the many problems I see with the product, is that how easily it could cause a dog to become fearful or even aggressive. It is impossible to predict what the dog might associate the shock with and consequently become aggressive or fearful. Perhaps it's the child in the room or another beloved pet.I don't even want to think about the torture that the use and misuse of this product could subject dogs to.Let's give dogs credit for being intelligent creatures. A down stay is not hard to teach. It's not the dogs here who lack intelligence. Please take this product off the market."
1,Take it off the market!,"Why not call it the ""terrorize your dog"" mat? Aversion training never, ever works as well as positive reinforcement; you needn't be a professional trainer to know that. This mat should be taken off the market immediately."
1,Horrifying,There is no other word for it ... this is just horrifying. I cant imagine doing anything so cruel in the name of keeping a pet in one place.
3,Not my favorite R.E.M. album but still a great listen!,"This album was not the one I thought it was when I bought it, but my bad. Still a great album and it was sold and shipped exactly as it was advertised. Thanks!"
4,A practical piece in a 5.1 system,"For $60, this is a very practical center channel speaker. The two 5.25"" drives are typically designed to cover the human voice spectum, a practical range between 200 and 4000 Hz. The tweeter, however, is a little week in my opinion. It is a 0.5"" unit with the crossover set at 5000 Hz. The high frequence signal, as well the low frequence one, should be well handled by the main speakers and the subwoofer. Few people can hear anything below 50 Hz or above 17K Hz. Signals in these spectrum are not directional. This speaker handles enough power in my 18x12 TV room. I am a budget orianted guy. Save the money but buy some meterial to make the room acoustically dead will be much more cost effective."
1,Didn't like the tweeter,"I didn't like the frequency response at all. This center channel made it very hard to understand certain people talking in movies. It had a huge hole in the frequency response. I temporarily put a cheap bookshelf back and the difference was incredible. I could not see that the speaker was damaged in any way, but maybe it was defective? I know the tweeter was working, but the bass was so high compared to the highs that it was awful.I retured it to Amazon for a refund, and got an Infinity PC350, which is just too big in my opinion, but it sounds great."
4,Crittertrail tubes,"My hamster loved these tubes except for when he started to chew on them. once he started it was all he chewed, i think that a well known hamster-cage company would make ""critter safe"" tubes. about 20 days or so after i installed the tubes my hamster got sick in the tubes and after a closer look at the puke it had little bits of tube in it.my hamster also wasnt able to move in there because she was sick. i still use some of these tubes but they dont chew on them when the tubes are verticle. four out of five stars."
4,Great for expanding,These are great for connecting cages and adding accessories. They are a little difficult to take apart but you wouldn't want them to come apart to easily anyway (or you might have a little critter running around your house).
3,Somtimes good often funny,In a way this is a good lithel book. At least it was the only one a found on the subject when á was in China. The storyes are godd but sometimes ther inturpitation is to simple and in the spirit of communisum. This is not folklore!!
4,"Fantástico, pero ...","la última canción ""Étude"" no es original del gran Mike, sino que es la pieza ""Recuerdos de la Alhambra"" del compositor español Francisco Tárrega. La versión es excelente, pero en ninguno de los créditos sale el compositor verdadero, así que en esto un cero para Mike."
4,Cognitive therapy self-help,"I've been looking for a cognitive therapy framework for some of my more dysfunctional family members, although I'm looking forward to this work for myself. The science behind this book is solid, although some of the language is flowery, which is a bit of a turn off. I'm also mildly concerned that the jargony nature of the text and the associated, pricey program may be a bit cultish. But, for those averse to the drawn out process of psychotherapy, this may be a good alternative to deal with obsessive/compulsive issues, provided the problems are not at a level which require direct professional help."
3,The Pathway:Follow the Road to Health and Happiness,I found the type hard to read and the information not as helpful as I had thought. I read The Solution: Diet Free Weightloss and found that book to be of more use for my situation.
3,The Pathway -,"I hav'nt finished reading the above book - but to this point I am finding it to be very well written, interesting, and easy to read.Good value for the money."
4,Helpful plan for addictions such as overeating,"I think this book has many good ideas for dealing with addictions. There are excellent small charts you can turn to quickly when you feel out of control (in my case dealing with food addiction). What was disappointing was that there seems to be a lot of follow-up required; reading the book and trying to self-heal is apparently, according to the auther, not enough. However it is confusing, difficult and apparently expensive to try to find a way to continue progressing after reading the book."
2,It's okay,"It's a NY Times best seller, but a slow read for me. The examples are too vague, as it seems like a self-help book for the reader rather than explaining simple concepts that people can add to their daily lives. I'm still waiting to see what the hype is about."
5,This book is different...,"The method described in this book has helped me make such profound positive changes in my life, that I feel compelled to write this review, although I have never written one before.This book is a huge step in the right direction for anyone who has ever felt confused or lost about what is the right thing to do: whether it's how to act or not act, what to say or not say, what to think or not think, what to eat or not eat, what to drink or not drink, what to buy or not buy, what to ask for and what's too much to ask, etc., etc, etc,...I don't know anyone who wouldn't benefit from reading this book, and for many people it could change their life forever."
5,The Pathway,"This is an amazing book. I have always been skeptical of ""self-improvement"" plans and was skeptical of this book until I started to see results. This book teaches a process with which to learn two simple skills that allow you do deal with every day problems, relationships and the excesses in your life. Her book has dramatically change my life. I recommend this book to any one who wants a better life."
5,Cause and Effect,"This book is revolutionary. this program is revolutionary. As many people who have struggled with food or other excesses know, it is monumentally difficult to overcome these patterns. Now I know why. All the other programs and diets deal with the effects, but not the TRUE cause of these problems. This program lets you go back to the roots and program yourself for emotional health. turning off the drive to excess is just a fabulous fringe benefit!!"
1,The Pathway is a Commercial,"Be aware that the Pathway is ultimately a commercial for The Solution workbook/ kits, also available on Amazon. There are six kits in total, all deemed essential by Mellin for one to be successful in the program. I found the program to be entirely too cultish in nature, and quite frankly, lent itself to manufacturing emotions rather than excavating truth of self. To be honest, I felt worse about myself while engaging in Mellin's program than before I came across it. I've subsequently kicked the habit. ;~) [...]"
5,Still the Best,"You can spend four times the amount for a fancy french dutch oven, or get the Lodge. I have both the 5 QT. and 7 QT. And they are great! Of all my pots and pans (and I have all the top brands) the Lodge dutch ovens get used the most. A tried and true product that needs no improvement."
5,Good size and cooks well,"I was weighing whether to get the 5-quart or the larger-sized dutch oven. This is a heavy piece of cookware, so finding the smallest (and lightest size) that works is a good idea. I am glad I got the 5-quart, as it was plenty large enough for a BIG roast -- which cooked up well."
5,Great Product,"Excellent value. I purchased this dutch oven for cooking Jambalaya. Because the lid is heavy, it is great for any rice dish. Would highly recommend."
5,Perfect wedding gift for your foodie friends,My lovely foodie friends bought this for me as a bridal shower gift. I've used it a few times since the shower in May and I love it. I love too that the construction is great and it will last forever!
4,Excellent Purchase,"Comparing with items available in the market, I will rate it as great. The price is good and quality great that too with super savings. I was hoping Amazon.com will also have some such great offers for enameled cast iron pots also."
5,american pride,Great price for the money. Exactly what it was supposed to be. lid fits pot great and finishes my set off. well worth purchasing. great dutch oven pot
1,Received Defective Product Twice,The pre-seasoning coat was chipped and peeling on the dutch oven I received. I didn't want it flaking off in the food so I exchanged it. The second one I received has the same problem. How frustrating. I am not going to try for a third.
1,Not happy at all with this.,Bought this item because I needed a reliable non-stick pot and immediately had issue with it. I took a while to write this review because I made every effort to not complain because everyone regards cast iron pots highly. The rust started to show from the first use even though I followed the care instuctions carefully and watched several videos on the Lodge site and on you tube to make sure i've done the right thing. Seasoned this thing over and over which equates to wasted time because now the Dutch Oven is unusable. This makes me very angry and frustrated because I now have to look for a new one. I tried to get away from the unhealty non-stick pots and also tried to stick to American made healthier products but everytime i used this pot black stuff was all over my food. Love to give positive reviews but its impossible to give one here. This pot is so rusty now its light brown. Not happy at all.
3,"Works well, but still needs seasoning","Product does the job, but the pre-seasoning isn't very good. I'm finding the bottom is rusting after a couple uses."
5,Great,"It was just what I expected it to be, heavy weight. Arrived when it was suppose to. Top quality product"
5,Lodge Logic Dutch Oven,"I just purchased this pot for baking bred, I love it! I'm sure it's just as great for any other use."
4,Fast free shipping,Came very fast with free shipping. Since it is such a heavey pot the free shipping was a great benefit.
4,Worked very well,I had never owned a Lodge Logic Dutch oven before. This product is very heavy duty construction. It worked very well. I cooked something for 4 hours stovetop and it worked wonderful and none of the liquid evaporated. I would recommend this product to anyone except those who can't lift heavy objects. I would recommend the smaller size to anyone having trouble lifting heavy items.
5,Cheap and Very Useful,"It's hard to imagine a more useful pot at a better price. It's great for soups or stews and cleanup is pretty easy afterward if you keep it seasoned and covered with a thin oil coating. It's a heavy son of a gun though. It heats slowly, but fairly evenly and once hot it stays hot for a while. Don't touch it without potholders."
4,arrived with rust,This cast iron dutch oven arrived with some rust spots on it and with the finish rubbed off in a few places. We have not used it yet so cannot comment on how well it performs.
1,Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Dutch,"I did not like it, did not cook my beans. I would not recommend for anyone else to order it."
2,too heavy!,"it is great to cook soup and meat with this oven, however, it is too heavy!If you want to exercise your arms, do consider this one!"
1,wrong item shipped,"I ordered this item while I was away from home and had it delivered to my house, trusting that I would receive the right item, I ordered a 5 quart pot instead I was sent a 2 quart pot, by the time I got home to and prepared to address the issue I found it was too late to return the item....thanks amazon, your trust is noted."
1,The one pot that does all,"I had owned cast iron before, and wasn't happy with having to clean it. The pre-seasoned dutch over was easy to clean (I have made chilie beans)The food turns out great, from chile to roast to chicken. I love my new pots"
3,"Great, except for rust","I love baking with this thing. However, after only about 3-4 uses, it's got rust all over the inside of the lid...nowhere else. I'm going to have to put some elbow grease into it."
3,heavy,I've used cast iron skillets in the past for cornbread and felt that that was the way to go. But this thing is extremely heavy without anything being placed in it but once it is loaded with food then it will even make the wire rack in the oven sag. I can see using this on a camp fire if you want to lug it on a camping trip.
5,LOVE IT,Awesome Dutch oven. It is easy to use on the stove top or the oven. It also works on the bbq grill. It is so versatile you can saute the onions and garlic in butter on the range and then add a roast and pop it in the oven to finish. It also is the perfect size for dessert. A pie filling or can of peaches covered with a yellow cake mix and coved with either a can of sprite or 4 Tbs butter in pats with a pinch of cinnamon works every time
3,not to sure about this product,Product was shipped fast but it was supposed to be seasoned already and it started to rust after one use. Super heavy and durable but I do not like that it rusts so easily
3,"Ended up selling, got an enameled one instead","I was so excited for this and it really looked lovely coming out of the box. But so go the complexities of cooking with cast iron, that I lost the nice season almost immediately as I scrubbed stuck-on food bits away, and went through a vicious cycles of salt-scrubbing away rust spots, re-seasoning, over & over again. Cooked like a charm, but since I'm not a camper I came to my senses and got a nice enameled dutch oven instead (recommend the Better Homes & Gardens label from Wal-Mart, it has a metal handle so unlike many enameled sets it's oven-safe right off the shelf).On the upside I was able to Craigslist this for $45."
3,Gift,Gave it as a gift to someone who hasn't used it yet. Good value and good name. I think she will get a lot of goof uses out of this product and highly encourage all to purchase this brand.
1,Rust spots and off taste to food,I read the reviews and thought I might be able to live with the fact that the preseason is of poor quality and rust spots appear but I did not read anything about the flavor of the food being off - It is off. I do not recommend this product although I am having a very hard time finding unseasoned products.
1,Disappointed in Pre-Seasoning Quality,"I have heard a lot of positive things in other reviews, but my own experience did not match them. The first time I used this pot, it rusted. I was very surprised by this, given the advertisement about pre-seasoning. I did not buy this pot to have to season it myself. I could have bought a much less expensive pot to do that. In short, I'm very concerned about the quality of this pot and don't recommend it."
5,Terrific!!,"Terrific packaging, came beautifully boxed. Product is a treasure to own. Cooks beautifully, just as you would expect a Lodge product to perform. Glad I got the larger pot. Perfect for family, keeps warm and cleans easily!"
5,perfect cooker,"This 5 qt. Dutch Oven is the perfect cooker,for roasts and chicken in the oven to soups and stews on the stovetop. I especially love knowing that Lodge Logic is an American made product. Iron cookware is the healthiest non-stick there is, and it's easy to clean up. I have been using Lodge Logic skillets and lids for years now and am So happy I got this Dutch Oven! This Iron cookware will last a Lifetime and will never have to be replaced again! Iron cookware holds the heat and cooks evenly."
5,Lodge always provide a good product at a good price!,I am really glad I added a good Dutch oven to my cookware. I trust the cast iron and I enjoy seeing it improve with seasoning and use.
3,"Heavy, Comforting, but a Bear to Clean","It's nice and comforting to cook beans and things in a big, black pot, and it's heavy but not too heavy. I just found that the cleaning the first time I used it was tough, and the inside of the lid already started looking rusty just from the liquid that collected on it when I didn't remove it and rinse it right away. I put oil on it and it looks pretty much OK now, but it's a bit discolored in spots."
1,Very Dissapointed,"I have had this pot for almost a year now. I have cleaned it according to the manufacturers recommendations. I have scrubbed it with steel wool and re-seasoned. Still everything I try to cook in it turns black and has a metallic smell and taste. I own several pieces of cast iron and have never had a problem with them. I have just scrubbed it down again and reseasoned with bacon fat yet again. It is now in the oven baking. If this doesn't do it, the pot goes in the trash and I will never purchase Lodge again."
2,Disappointing,This product is of low quality. It is poorly pre-seasoned so that rust appeared inside the oven after I used it to boil water for the first time. Besides it is very heavy and not convenient to use it. I returned this product in the end. Very disappointing.
4,GREAT ITEM... Kind of hard to reseason,This dutch oven is great! you can bake it in the oven and nothing happens. Kind of hard to Re season though had to do it 2 in row. Good product overall
5,Typical Lodge quality,"Lodge is hard to beat quality. This is a good size for frying chicken and fish. I remember growing up , this is the only pot my mom would fry chicken in. Great quality, good value. Will last a lifetime!"
5,Cast Iron back in my life!!,Used these with the family when I was a child and it is great to have them back in our home to cook wonderful meals with the new family. Plan to pass these down to our children and hopefully they can do the same as we have for them.
2,Poorly Seasoned,"This product is ""pre-seasoned,"" but after only one use the seasoning came off and the inside of the lid rusted. I used it to make a one pot meal of black beans and rice. I browned salt pork on the range, added the beans, rice and stock, and baked at baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The food came out great but the pot was ruined. I think the pot might have been OK if I stripped it down to bare metal with oven cleaner and seasoned it properly. I don't like it enough to invest that much effort in it so I returned it."
5,Lodge Logic 7 qrt Dutch Oven,"i just recently received my dutch oven and have only used it a couple of times. it is a very good product. the cast iron holds the heat for a very long time and seems to distribute the heat well. it came preseasoned and ready to go. i would highly recommend this product.Pro-Logic Dutch Oven, 7 Quarts 12 in, Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron"
5,Great Dutch Oven for the Price,"This is a very nice cast iron pot that is pre-seasoned. I have several cast iron pots that have been handed down to me over the years and this one ranks right of there with the others. It is pre-seasoned but needs more, you can either do another seasoning and also cook some bacon in the pan which seasons cast iron very well. The lid had some rust on it so it was not totally seasoned but I would still prefer it pre-seasoned because it did not take me very long to clean it up, put some oil on it and cook. I have since seasoned it again but I would do this with all my cast iron. Remember the more you cook in them the better they get.Never ever use soap on a cast iron pot and try to use bacon fat or lard instead of things like vegetable oil, this will sometimes make it feel sticky."
5,Lodge Logic is even better than a friend told us it would be!,"It makes wonderful bread, and is incredibly easy to use (except for the fact that it's really heavy). We love it!"
4,Great for stews,"I like this dutch oven very much. I used it to cook pork roast with onions and apples, and it came out fork tender and delicious. The lid is heavy enough to make sure none of the moisture or juices evaporate while it is in place. It is versatile enough to use on top of the stove for stews and soups, it bakes in the oven for roasts, and it goes on the grill for beans and for anything that you want to impart a smoky flavor. Make sure you follow the directions for curing the pot, and clean up relatively quickly after use. I rub in a little oil after cleaning and I do not store it with the lid on. This traps moisture and leads to rusting on the inside of the pot. After using for a couple of months, it seems built to last a lifetime."
5,5 Qt DO Heaven,Just received my Lodge 5 Qt Dutch Oven. I also ordered the Lodge meat rack/trivet and Max Temp handle mitt. All items arrived in perfect condition. The DO is larger than I was envisioning from seeing the box at a retail store. From the time it was shipped to the time I received the items was less than 24 hours( shipped from KS to MO). Bonus: The 5 qt DO lid fits my 10 1/4 inch Lodge cast iron skillet.
5,Lodge 5qt dutch oven,"This is a great dutch oven. Consider the price difference between this and your favorite Le Crueset dutch oven. I bought this for one of my daughters and she uses it regularly. I teamed up the dutch oven with the book ""Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking."" A nice combo even before the taking Amazon's prices into account."
2,Nice Pot but Not Really Pre-seasoned,"This was the first piece of pre-seasoned cast iron I purchased and I was not thrilled with it. I own 3 cast iron skillets and thought this would be a nice addition. It's a nice sized pot, but the pre-seasoning is awful. Like some others have stated, the inside of the pot is not smooth. This makes it difficult to clean and reseason because it tears tiny bits of paper off of the paper towel and tiny fibers off of a fabric dish towel. I used it on Thanksgiving to make candied sweet potatoes and although they didn't stick, they smelled of metal while cooking and tasted like metal as well. Also, the condensation on the lid created rust. If this were available in natural cast iron instead of pre-seasoned, it would be great. I have since bought another in the enameled cast iron and use it almost daily. You get the same even heat but without having to season - and the food doesn't stick either (unless you burn it)."
2,Rust,I know Lodge makes quality products but my dutch oven lid started to rust very quickly. Not good and very gross! Doesn't rust cause cancer? Not sure if you suppose to do something special with this dutch oven or not. Very disappointed...I had so many plans!
4,Be careful what you cook in it!,"This dutch oven is great for searing meats, but not so great for stews, or anything with an acid base as in tomatoes. The taste of iron gets into the food if you make a stew with it."
5,Great for Artisan Bread,I bought this specifically instead of a regular dutch oven because I wanted something I knew could stand the 450 degree oven temperatures and not have any issues.... to use to make artisan breads. This Lodge dutch oven has worked marvelously. I love it. My bread turns out perfectly every time. Who could ask for more. I would highly recommed it for artisan bread -- instead of a high priced one (like Le Crueset).
1,full of tiny holes,"I just received a 7-quart Dutch oven and a 12"" skillet. The cooking surfaces were full of 1-1.5mm holes, up to 2mm deep.I'm contemplating whether I should try buying them in a brick-and-mortar store instead, to visually inspect them prior to purchase.How did Lodge permit these to ever leave the factory? Very disappointed."
3,Chalk up another coating issue,"Thank you, B. Davenport for writing about seasoning your own dutch oven when it arrived imperfect. Mine arrived with the coating entirely scraped off parts of the lid and toward the top of the pot. I am very good about caring for my other cast iron pieces, and so I am going to keep this one and give those spots a little extra care."
4,Great Value,"Great value, especially if you're one to love the old school feel of solid cast iron, or one interested in making those sensational ""no knead bread"". There are a few cosmetic/minor issues: (1) there were a couple rust spots when it came and (2) the seasoning/coating isn't as thick as one would prefer. These are easily fixed, nevertheless. I scrubbed away the rust spots with steel wool, and applied a thin coating of coconut butter (great alternative to lard or shortening), and baked the pot at 450 for an hour or two. I have only used my dutch oven a few times so far, and I've so far seasoned it every time I'm done using it. The seasoning at the scrubbed spots is already growing back, and the pot has taken on a beautiful raven black shiny finish. Highly recommended."
4,Graet value,"With free shipping to Hawaii, this item cost less than what I could have gotten it locally. I bought six of them for my Boyscout troop, so the savings were even greater."
5,Love my Lodge,"I bought this Lodge Dutch Oven after getting their 12 inch skillet. Since then I've added a 10 inch chef's skillet, 10 1/4 inch regular skillet and the 19 inch grill/griddle combo.The dutch oven has made some of the best pot roast, bbq pork, and so on I've ever eaten!I'm hooked."
5,Love it!,I;d never gotten around to getting a Dutch Oven before. But I wanted to learn to make French Onion Soup and it suggested using one. So I finally bought one...this one. I LOVE it! I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes and using this is just such a great way to slowly cook things to get the best flavors out of the food...without burning things. And this is a perfect size for the cooking I do. My veggie stocks come out so much better using a Dutch Oven to roast the veggies. One of the best things I every bought...next to my wok. And this one is amazing quality for the price.
4,This is great!,Its very heavy and you have to keep it oiled or it will rust but Im cooking seafood stew in it tonight.
4,Be careful caring for the lid,"I love this dutch oven but I got a little lax in caring for it, especially the lid. Since you don't cook on the lid you must care for it accordingly. If you use the lid at all during braising, stewing, etc..it will collect water on the lid and you have to make sure you dry it off ( I even heat it a little on my stove top) and coat it with oil before putting it away. I stopped doing that and the lid very quickly got a lot of rust, but I cleaned and seasoned it and it looks great once again."
2,Messy,"This pot is very heavy, takes a lot of effort to lift (especially with a sore shoulder). Because of the spiked lid and porous interior, cleaning it is a chore and it blackened my spongeI recently discovered the joy of braising and thought a dutch oven would be more versatile than a brasier. My biggest gripe, this lid does not sit flushed on the pot so that both times I used the pot, (recipes had no more than 2 cups of liquid) the liquid 'steamed' out and left a mess all over my stove.I will use it because it was a gift and I appreciate the giver's good intention."
5,Cast Iron Dutch Oven: A Great Buy,This was my first dutch oven purchase and I was a little apprehensive given some of the feedback I read about the seasoning. I did a little research and found this was a great option since it was my first purchase and I did not want to spend a lot of money. I a very pleased with my purchase and after reading the user's manual I felt more comfortable about my choice. I used the dutch oven immediately to cook short ribs and they came out amazing. I did not have any problems with cleaning or re-seasoning the iron.
4,My mom loved it!,My mother always wanted one every time we saw one shopping but she wouldn't buy one because they can be pretty pricy. So I got her this one. The price was great and she has used it several times. She says it cooks everything quickly but without drying the food out and with flavor. I might have to get me one.
5,Great product,I love cast iron products and this one is as good as all of the other cast iron products I have used. Plus the seller gave me fast and exceptional service
4,excellent product,"When you buy cast iron cookware you already probably know that you are getting into a little bit of extra effort for cleaning and maintenance of the iron's non-stick properties. That said, the Lodge pre-seasoned dutch over arrived in perfect new condition, seasoned and ready to go. The unit is a fine basic dependable iron cooking vessel, good for baking, stews, and whatever you want. I am using the dutch oven as a cooking pot for use with an induction coil cooking surface.i recommend this unit to experienced cooks who want to add a versatile cast iron pot to their kitchen tools."
4,Tin Roof..RUSTED,"After using my Lodge 7 quart for the first time for a pot roast,I noticed a little rust and so seasoned it,but now after making a stew, I notice alot of rust..so much for pre-seasoning..It's not a big deal to season it again,but I would have assumed that the factory pre-seasoning would have lasted longer,particularly for the price I paid"
5,Love it!,I've always wanted a cast iron Dutch oven and this one is perfect! I can't wait to use it for camping!
5,Great summary of the Bauhaus,"I recieved this book promptly, in perfect (new) condition, still wrapped in the cellophane. It is a wonderful summary of the Bauhaus school, with full-page illustrations and tons of pictures of art from students and masters from the school. There is also a great little biography section for many of the ""greats"" who emerged from the school, at the end of the book. I would definately buy this book again, especially for the price!"
1,a great idea... but it ends there.,"I was going to buy this, but I decided to rent it from netflix first... I'm very glad that I did. The one thing that the advertisers neglected to mention is that none of the routines featured in this DVD are new... it's all old routines from the 80s... so if you ever watched A&E's night at the improv, then you have already heard all of these jokes. I as quite disappointed... Don't waste your money."
5,Best Cookbook ever,The Cookbook was in great shape and came in on time. I love this coookbook and the price is perfect.
3,eh eh eh,With out fog it dosen't look that amazing.For best results.. There should be fog for best resultsOther than that thought it would be bigger and coolerSo if you have fog than 4/5No fog 2.5-3/5
3,lazer review,I am somewhat satisfied however the sound response only works a very high volume. It should have been made with a sound sensetivity switch. Product is also a little pricy for what you get.
5,REM + Zevon make one great LP,"Not only is this his best in my opinion, this may be one of my favorite all around albums. There's not a throw-away track here as far as I'm concerned. A constant in my rotation. Funny thing, I've never considered myself a big REM fan."
5,Finest Work,"I've heard them all and feel confident in saying this is his best work. If you don't like it, you just don't care for the man. If you're a fan and don't have this CD, do yourself a favor and order it immediately!"
4,Excellent Primer,Kaplan and Sadock have continued their proud tradition in this update of their classic work. This is the primer of mental health and it provides student and clinician with the required basics for understanding the workings of the human mind.It is a required edition in every clinician's library.
5,A Real Treat,"Barbara Metzger is one of the best in this genre, easy to read, great fun with the characters and a fairly believable storyline.Getting engaged by the fathers at age six and 1 is a nice touch, getting disengaged due to a falling out by the fathers later and then promises by Smokey to ""marry you anyway"" was a nice touch. I absolutely loved the story having them grow up together but then become estranged due to the usual differences in schooling and boys vs. girls of that era.I loved Sparrow's character, independant and firery. Smokey was fun too, but Uncle Matthew and his wife were the really fun characters. And unlike the other review, those accidents were quite funny and added a nice sideshow to Smokey and Sparrow's attempts at becoming friends again.I recommend this book to anyone who likes good clean historical romance novels."
4,GREAT GOOGLY MOOGLY,"If you are a Zappa fan BUY IT NOW ! If you are not a Zappa fan but you always wanted to be ,BUY IT The Persuaions are special. When I listen to the Persuasions sing Zappa I know somewhere Frank Zappa is smiling."
4,They make it seem so easy....,"I've often found Frank Zappa's music to be challenging, even to the point of being intimidating. But I've also found that if you listen well, his music will reward you with its (often hidden) beauty. This is borne out by this album. The a capella singing group the Persuasions, of whom Frank Zappa (along with his wife, Gail) was an early admirerer and booster. This is album is evidently both a thank you to the Zappas and a tribute to Frank's music.That the Persuasions could sing some very tricky music in their own way and make seem so effortless should be evidence enough of their talent. Standouts are ""Anyway the Wind Blows"", ""The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing"", ""Hotplate Heaven at the Green Hotel"", and ""You Are What You Is."" Their rendition of ""Lumpy Gravy"" is alone worth the price of this album."
3,"To be Frank, acapella...","Anyone familiar with Zappa know just how complex his music is. Now, take out all the instruments and now try hearing it done with only voices! This is the daunting task the Persuasions have done, and for the most part it works. I was hoping the voices would have a greater range (most of them range from bass to a moderate tenor), but the arrangements compensate for the groups limitations. ""Harder Than Your Husband"" is fabulous, as is ""The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing"" which they first did on ""Zappa's Universe"" (highly recommend). Also, ""You Are What You Is"" is a standout. ""My Guitar..."" does comes off sounding like the classic ""Charlie Brown"" which is an awkward pairing of styles and repeats the lyrics too many times as they also do on ""Any Way The Wind Blows"". Not a bad album at all, and a fresh approach to Zappa fans who are looking for something different than the usual Ryco reissues."
4,Who could imagine......?,"This project's love and respect for FZ is evident throughout. It is a great collection spanning a body of work whose final chapter is yet to be written. From the opening of Lumpy Gravy to the reference to the full circle work of Civilization Phase III of the mystery track, this is a respectful, yet tongue in cheek (with eyebrows?) tribute. I think FZ really IS in there someplace! I hope this inspires boys and girls everywhere to dig a bit deeper and find that ""help, I'm a rock"" and ""anywhere the wind blows"" appeared on the same vinyl disc together at one time."
2,It is too small to fit anything into it,From the description I had a feeling that it would be small but this is ridiculous. Can't even fit two soda cans into it. Instead of being my car trash can it now looks like the trash in my car.
5,pop up trash can,Love this item. Bought one for myself and one as a gift. Both of us love the size style and convenience for an auto.
3,Seriously Tiny,"This is very well built. It is sturdy as can be. However, not much fits into it. It is about the size of the bottom half of a two liter bottle. It will work well for tissue and stuff but if you have kids and actually do accumulate stuff in the car, you may want to look for something else.On the other hand, if you just have the occasional small item, this is perfect. Sturdy and dark enough to become inconspicuous. You can hang it from the loop or Velcro it from the base (Velcro comes attached to the base). Also, when not in use, it collapses to store easily. And you can't really beat the price, $4.99 and with prime so no shipping."
2,Too small to be very useful.,"I must agree, this was disappointing in that it is too small to be very useful. Plus, the velcro on the bottom to help it be secured to the floor of your car worked for about 5 minutes. Now it falls over easily and dumps its contents. I would not buy again."
4,Good buy.,Cheap and good value for money. Use with a cover or liner. Else gets dirty. Is machine washable. Good buy.
2,Disappointing purchase,"I thought this would work good in my sedan, but nope, it didn't. It is held in place by one small Velcro strip if about two inches which allows it to rock back and forth and easily get dislodged when bumped. Then as in my car there is no good place to put it. I attached this unit to the center console between the seatbacks and the Velcro finally came completely off leaving a very sticky layer that held the Velcro in place. I just wish it was held better in place, but it wasn't so I can't give it a decent rating."
2,looks much bigger than it is!,"It looks like it takes up a bit of floor space in the photo, in reality this ""trash can"" might hold a waded up piece of paper, It is SO small."
4,Should have planned ahead,"The item is perfect for it's intended use. The problem, and it's entirely my fault, is that I found that there is not a place to hang it in my vehicle. Nothing wrong with the product, just be sure you have someplace to put it before ordering."
2,Not useful,No top closure and almost no mounting options mean this thing constantly dumps its contents. I don't use mine and would not buy again.
4,"Sigh; slow movement is Nowak, not Haas","The other reviewers rave about this; it's pretty good but not right near the top, I feel.The DG cover advertises this as the Haas version, but it's Nowak: has the really bad cut in the 3rd movement which totally wrecks the structure and buildup to the final climax: see Robert Simpson's book on why Haas is SO much better here (or just use your ears!).So that misnomer about Haas is a major disappointment, since otherwise this recording is pretty good. Other reviewers say the sound is great, etc. In fact, the strings get rather thin on top: this is a more ""shadowy"" type recording than ""clear cut"" in sound. So not absolutely ideal, but OK. Horns come through in the background in interesting ways not often heard on other recordings...."
5,Bohm's 8th - terrific,"Karl Bohm was one of the finest conductors of the past century. He didn't specialize in any one particular idiom, but covered about everything from his excellent Mozart and Beethoven Symphonies to Brahms. But where he really left his mark was with his Bruckner recordings. Along with Furtwangler and Bruno Walter, Bohm was my favorite conductor of Bruckner's great symphonies, and this 8th from 1976 is no exception. I think most folks are familiar with his brilliant rendition of the 4th, but it used to come coupled with an equally impressive No.3 (you may be able to find it used). Even better than his 1977 No.7 on DG is a live one from the same year on Audite. Both performance and sound are superior to that on his excellent DG release. Buy this while it's cheap, you never know when they will yank it off the shelf and those used oop prices tend to be high."
4,Slow,"I agree with Mr.Steel. This is a remarkable recording but would notplace it among the best. First of all, it is one of the slowest i'veever listened. It sounds for me sclerosed and patched at some keypassages that enhances the fragmentarian background in the structureof the work. The Vienna Philharmonic plays magnificent but there arefor sure more compelling and satisfying performances in Karajan (EMI),Furtwängler (with the same orchestra), Barbirolli, and Wand (Berlin)and Sinopoli among modern recordings."
5,Revising My First Review,"After hearing this CD upon its arrival in the mail, I must change my old review. This is one of the best peices that I have heard. What a wonderful mix of folk and jazz. Jaqui's voice is so soothing, almost nurturing. I do recommend this CD, I don't think you will be dissappointed. If this CD was to get wide exposure here in the US it would go platnum. Everyone I have played this CD for has fallen in love with it, EVERYONE!!"
2,Not Sure...,"I bought this due to some of the positive reviews on Amazon and some other sites. It does go through the propane tank quickly, probably in about three weeks but am pleased I dont have to plug it into an electric outlet. This summer we have practically zero mosquitos in our back yard. So, you say, this must be working, right? I hope so. On the other hand, I have very few mosquitos caught in the basket of this contraption. Thus, I am not sure if it is the machine that is working or simply the fact that we have less mosquitos this summer as compared to past years???"
2,Worked great first year. won't work this year.,"$300 is a lot for what you get, but it did work very well for me last summer. it caught lots of bugs and I noticed a difference. Sadly, this year, it won't even start up. Poor quality really annoys me more than the bugs do. Grrrr."
1,Junk,"I've waited patiently for the last month - this thing hasn't trapped much of anything. There are plaenty of mosquitos in my yard - they just don't seem to be drawn to this trap. I've tried all the different settings and moved it around but this thing doesn't seem to do much of anything other than blink at night. And to make matters worse, it blew flew an entire tank of propane in 15-20 days - NOT 60 days (as they claim). I plan to ask for my money back..."
2,Not convinced this stuff does anything,"All I know is that it uses up a lot of propane, and it doesn't seem to catch all that many mosquitoes. It does catch them, but I'm not sure if it actually makes any difference."
3,Pretty good for the price,"I've ran this unit continuously for about a month. While it does get some mosquitoes, it does not eliminate the vast majority. In fact, I can sit 5 feet away from it after it has been running, and in a few minutes I get swarmed.My understanding is, there are several different species of mosquito, and they are attracted to different things. After studying the unit in action, it is my conclusion that it is not effective on the type of mosquitoes in my area, central western Idaho.I would still recommend it, though, because it does catch some mosquitos, and for the price, it beats swatting them all."
1,RP Octenol Lures -- Overpriced!!,"I have used the Skeeter Vac for years.....it is a very effective means for reducing mosquitoes and other biting insects. But almost $23 for ONE RP Octenol Lure???? Are you kidding me? I thought I would get a three pack for that price. The product works great, but what a rip off for the stuff you need to keep the product working for more than a season. Shame on you Amazon and Skeeter Vac."
5,Beyond words beautiful and soulfully relaxing!,"I have had the cassette tape for years and have played it more times than I could count, to relax, to fall asleep, to soothe nerves, for upliftment, to feel beautiful, to connect spiritually. I am going to buy the CD now, or download the album for MP3. I am so glad to have this. What a wonderful musician!"
5,A Very Refreshing New Voice In Music!,"I have a short list of 'essential' cds by the women of country music. They are: Faith Hill's ""Faith"", Martina McBride's ""Evolution"", Shania Twain's ""Come On Over"" and ""The Woman In Me"" and Trisha Yearwood's ""Songbook"". Jessica Andrew's ""Heart Shaped World"" belongs on this list too - it's that good. She has a truly unique and a wonderfully rich and confident voice. Jessica, I wish you the best in the years to come!"
5,Great CD!,i really like this cd ~ i think she has a great vioce & very original songs that are upbeat & fun to listen to!
5,"What a voice, what a c.d!!!!!!","Jessica Andrew's c.d. ""Heart Shaped World"" is one of the best surprises out there. She has a voice that will blow you away. Her song ""You Go First"" is the catchiest tunes since ""This Kiss."" There is not a bad song on the disc. Other Hits are ""The Riverside"" & ""I'll Take Your Heart."" Don't let her age of 15 scare anyone off....she can sing with the best of them. Buy this c.d....you won't be disappointed! She'll ""Take Your Heart."""
4,Great CD,"I just have a question to ask. ""Unbreakable Heart"" is a remake. Does anyone remember who it was originally done by and the year. This has been bugging me since I first heard her version."
2,Not as good as I expected,"The singles that were released on the radio were good, but when I bought her album, it was boring and not as good as I had anticipated."
3,Impedance matching controls for multiple speaker setup,"Bought this to connect 5 pairs of RC60i polk audio speakers (8 ohm) to our office speaker setup. 3 of our other volume controls were the Phoenix Gold VMT-100 variety that has jumpers that let you change the multiplier. This control has a metal tab that you move to adjust the 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x settings (they call it index ""1, 2, 3, 4"") I believe when you set it to a higher multiplier it just prevents you from setting the sound higher. i.e. instead of 12 steps of attenuation there are 10, 8, etc..I gave this 3 stars cuz one of the volume controls had a problem with intermittent contact. One day the audio would cut out and taking the control back out of the wall I discovered that the terminal block was loose. I was sure that the set screws were tightened down on the speaker wires so that wasn't the problem. Wiggling the block would cause the sound to come and go. Perhaps bad solder contacts?"
2,What I discovered upon further research,"I was reading up on Christopher Hansard only to discover that there are petitions against him online inciting him as a phony and a crook. I understand that there's the potential to encounter a lot of new age-y bs a book like this, but I picked it up with the most earnest of intentions, hoping that the historical context would lend authenticity to the subject. Realizing the author is a fake ruined it for me. I feel like a sucker!"
1,BEWARE!,"The FIRST time I used the pump, the cap developed a hairline crack, rendering the pump useless [since it would no longer maintain a vacuum]. I didn't use gorilla strength in tightening the cap onto the reservoir, so I gotta believe the plastic material from which the cap was constructed doesn't have much structural integrity."
1,Poor Quality Product,Tried to use it. Reservoir pipes broke. Does not do what it claims.Trying to get hold of Equus to get a replacement.Thanks
2,VACUUM,"Equus 3660 Hand Vacuum Pump and Brake Bleeding KitThe description makes it sound like a metal, commercial pump. It is, in fact, the same mechanisim as almost every other like plastic consumer unit. It works but it is over priced, based on the description. I.e., for a pump it's puffery."
4,pretty nice little book,"may be if I did not have """"hair:a book of braiding"" from klutz series , i was giving this 5 stars.but this one is a bit brief compare to the klutz one.since that one is not available, i recommend this one.I also ordered fabulous hair.i'll let you know wich one is better when i fabulous hair."
5,Great,Learned a lot about braiding. Enjoyed the book. Some of the styles are not for everyday use but you get the basic's.
5,excellent book for beginners and novices,"I have the older version of this book, which was supplied to me when I took a machinist pre-apprenticeship course, and I am about to buy this newer version.The book is not too wordy, making it easy to understand the basic concepts of machining and the terminology that goes along. It also clearly explains how to use lathes, milling machines, measuring equipment and other basic machine shop equipment. I have not yet read the newer version, but the older book was a little bit lacking in the use of more complicated machines such as horizontal and vertical boring machines, which an advanced user might be interested in. Also there was only one chapter on cnc machines, which did not go into any great depth."
2,Not Great,"Let me say that the book is okay, nothing wrong with the book. But here is my question: What is the purpose of the book, the exact purpose?? I work around tools and shops so when I see a book for $110. I think it must have something new. It does not, and it is at a level where it does not really have enough information to help. It is sort of am overview with pictures and some drawings. Coffee table book on machines - so to speak.I would recommend forgetting about this book and buy some regular shop manuals or shop guides from a tool supplier. There are a number of one and two volume sets that give a lot more useful information, and very detailed information. Maybe this is for high school students, but not for professional shops.Sorry but that is my humle opinion. I have the book and it collects dust. My recommendation: check out MACHINERY'S HANDBOOK also on amazon.com."
1,The real price is....,Don't be fooled - these people offer a low price and then make it up on the shipping. It doesn't cost $35 to ship a case. Why not just list the actual price of ~$75 (rhetorical question)?
5,Much better than the plain guitar case,This case is much better than the $30 case that has no lining. My daughter uses this case to take her acoustic guitar to lessons. It keeps her guitar from banging around like it would in a cheap case. She likes the compartment to store picks. It is also nice that it has a lock in case you don't want anyone messing with your guitar.
5,good case,I ordered my case and four days later it was setting on my doorstep.The case was everything i could have wanted(and for the price much more). This is a very sturdy case and even though it is not important to me it is a very nice looking case.I have looked at alot of different case's and for the money this is the best deal i have found and i am very happy with my choice.My father is a guitar collector and he was impressed with it.So i guess what i am saying is that if you are looking for a new case i think you will be pleased with this one.
5,Definitely Worth It!,"Excellent case for $50. Hard to believe I found a case of this quality for that price. Shipping was only $7 and some change so I'm not sure where the other person got $35. If you need a case to protect your guitar, don't buy an outrageously overpriced one from your local dealer, get it here. I ordered Monday and it arrived Thursday, pretty good!"
4,Awesome Deal,"This subwoofer really improved the quality of my sound and was exactly what I needed. I was a little dissatisfied with just my 2 studio monitors as they didn't have enough bass, but this just elevated the quality of the music to another level. This is probably the best deal you can get under $200. It works perfectly for me, so I have no complaints. If this is near your price range, definitely get it."
3,Simple Subwoofer Solution,"This model does what is says, but could use a little more UMPFFF! I have it connected to an entry level Denon A/V receiver which is rated at 100W for the Subwoofer. I had to tweak the settings on the receiver and the Subwoofer before I could get these things working together - and eventually I began hearing that magical thumping sound I had been waiting for. I'll post more when I have time to tweak the settings further and try out some new configurations.For the price, I'm satisfied. But if you want more than just ""OK"", upgrade the power and the Subwoofer to a larger model."
3,BIC V-80m subwoofer,"Does an adequate job creating extra bass, however it is somewhat dwarfed in my family room, wish I had gotten the 12"" model."
4,"The ""classic"" book of the P40.","This is the classic work on the history and versions of the p40 family of aircraft. It contains a brief history of the development of this important aircraft, a chapter of each of the versions built, with plenty of photos and colour plates. This is not a large or expensive volume, but is a classic. If you are a fan of this aircraft, you must have this volume. I also recommend the P40 walkarround volume by the same author."
3,Small plows only such as ATV,Product was not as expected but the vendor without question replied to me with a RMA number. No issues and prompt service.
3,Where is The Best OF?,"Back in the late 80's ""Serious"" by Donna Allen was hot!!I wish they had the 12"" version(long version) on CD. Maybe compile some of her other jams such as Joy and pain and we would be very pleased."
3,A novice in protein structure,"This is not a really comprehensive book (it cannot be, with its size), but it is very useful as a quick reference or when you need to refresh the basic concepts of protein structure."
5,a Great overview,"Lionel Richie is One of the Few Artists who truly did it the right way both as a member of a very Successful Band&then later on as a Solo Artist. He understood what Words&Music was truly all about. his material covered R&B,Pop,Gospel&country. He didn't sound like anybody else&just always understood the power of using the Bridge in his music. the Man is One of the All time Greatest Artists as a Singer,Songwriter&all around force. so many great songs that truly stand the test of time. this is what a Double Set is all about. Lionel Richie is One of My All Time Favorite Artists."
1,Out of date,This is the first edition of the teacher's supplement. Alan Wick's 2nd edition has been out for awhile now. The current edition (copyright 2006) of the teacher's supplement for the 2nd edition has a GREEN cover. The blue cover is the 2004 version and is way out of date.Why would anyone buy this older version when the current version has been out for four years?
5,Women Who Followed Their Men to the Frontier North,"After reading The Floor of Heaven by Howard Blum, I couldn't help feeling sorry for the women of the Yukon gold rush era. They were unsung heroes--either being left behind, divorced or forced to relocate to wild frontiers. Some traveled solo, willingly becoming miners, madams or merchants. This little book chronicles their life stories, and includes fascinating pictures and maps. Think your life is tough? You'll think again after reading these harrowing tales. And to think they did it all in dresses!"
3,Good Info. -- Could Be Longer,"This is B&W footage from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's coverage of the Six-Day War (dubbed Operation Strike, Zion! by Israel), the only film crew allowed on the battlefield.This video has some spectacular shots, such as Israeli figher jet camera footage of the downing of an Egyptian MiG, though unfortunately, due to age, much of the film quality itself is poor.Since the film crew was behind Israeli lines, the viewpoint is from their perspective and so might come across as slightly more pro-Israeli (as a warning to those who tend to get fanatical on the issue).Militarily, this is an excellent study of an incredible war where superior intelligence, tactics and resolve were able to overcome superior numbers, arms and technology in a remarkably short period of time.The only complaint I have is that, for the price, it could have been longer as it is only 60 min. long. That keeps it from getting more than 3 stars."
2,Looks fun but problematic,"We've tried installing it on 3 of our computers, but so far it says it cannot be used on our systems. Tried calling the company, but being left on hold. I wonder why it's so difficult to use? Looks cute though. I'm hoping to eventually figure it out."
3,Rollover,"I had seen this movie years ago and liked it, but couldn't remember much of it. So, I decided to buy it and liked it again (probably not as much as the first time though).Service when ordering from Amazon has always been very good and fast. I appreciate it."
5,It's Still Working,"The Willie Lynch method of controlling your slave: turn the old against the young, the light against the dark the male against the female and cause them to believe that you (the master) hold the key to their happiness. This science worked three hundred years ago and still works today. Fortunately more of the affected group are becoming enlighted and no longer believing in the science of slave psychology. But some have not seen the light. They do not read and do not listen. I wish that everybody no matter the ethnic identification will read this book. I believe this knowledge will help bring unity."
5,NO THY SELF - THE RESURRECTION,"MR.ALVIN MORROW GIVES INSIGHT, THAT AFRICANS IN AMERICA HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO BE ""BLACK-EUROPEANS WITH A EUROPEAN CONSCIOUSNESS"", TAUGHT THROUGH THE EUROPEAN TEACHING OF CHRISTIANITY, THE EUROPEAN TEACHING OF HIS-STORY, EUROPEAN ILL-MORAL BEHAVIOR, ECT. BREAKING THE CURSE OF WILLIE LYNCH, IS AN EXCELLENT STARTING POINT AT DEVELOPING A ""AFRICAN CONSCIOUSNESS"". LEARNING THIS KNOWLEDGE TAKES TIME AND PATIENTS, THIS IS OUR-STORY, THAT WE AS AFRICANS WERE NEVER MEANT TO KNOW ABOUT. STUDY & LEARN ABOUT- KHEMET, HORUS & OSIRIS, THE ROMAN ECCUMENICAL COUNCILS, AFRICAN SPIRITUALITY AND THE ANCESTORS, WHY AFRICANS WERE INTRODUCED TO THE BIBLICAL TEXT, OVERSTAND THE METHODS USED TO KEEP AFRICANS DIVIDED, RESEARCH AMERICAN & WORLD POLITICS THE MONEY & THE POWER, AND THE DUMBING DOWN OF AFRICANS IN THE BLACK CHURCH. ( THE AFRICANS AWAKENING FROM THIS KNOWLEDGE, IS WILLIES GREATEST FEAR & WORLDLY NIGHTMARE )."
1,Thumbs way down for Breaking the Curse of Willie Lynch,"This is a horribly written book. This author should be ashamed to have published such a poorly written book. Between the misplaced commas, incorrectly hyphenated words, and misspelled words, I felt dumber just reading it. He could have easily written this on a Word document and would have been better off for it. He also puts in misinformation such as excessive Vitamin K causing high blood pressure and strokes?! Huh? Didn't learn that one medical school..."
4,very nice pictures,"This book tells its stories mostly through pictures of the types of people you are likely to encounter in the city of Baltimore. Being a recent convert to the charm of Baltimore, I really enjoyed the photographs and appreciated the way they conveyed the sense of community that you can find in the inner city if you look for it."
2,Poor Littlejim,"Poor Litlejim was how my fourth graders always referred to the main character in this book. Poor Littlejim tried and tried to please his father, but always ended up being hurt and disappointed. By the time we were two-thirds through the book, many of my students were beginning to doubt the validity of the characters. Bigjim, the father, was so one-dimensional, that we could predict his reaction to every situation. We did, however, enjoy this authentic look into mountain life, written by a person who knows the region firsthand. For an excellent book by this author, please read The Year of the Perfect Christmas Tree."
1,It's just not good.,"The image on the product view isn't accurate. Is not the same item that you receive when you see it. Also, it has a strap that brokens so easily, with normal use. Don't buy this."
4,awesome little bag for a cool little system.,"I bought this the otherday to meet the needs of my new DS Lite. I really just wanted a game case, but those are few and far between. This has a lot of pockets, and slots for 9 games. It holds all of my accessories, and is also big enough to fit a single DS hardcase within the zipper area.My DS light fits snuggly in the bottom pocket. It seems to me that the pocket is placed in a way to both pad it from bumps and bruises, but also, hide it from anyone snooping around where they shouldn't be."
1,Poor service,"The picture above shows only grey, black and blue for color choices. I have two boys, and even though I stated that when ordering, i recieved two pink cases.We called and they told us that there was no way to ensure we got the right color.So, after all the excitement, I now have to find something different for my children to use to carry their units and games in our upcoming move from Italy back to the States.This is very displeasing.So, only order if you TRUELY don't care what color you recieve....becasue it may not be one shown."
5,there are only a handul left,Check this man out if you get the chance. This sound is not going to exist after a small handful of men are gone.
4,good mix,"just like the title ""roots stew"" is a mixture of acoustic/rockin blues with an assortment of tunes from the uptempo ""jump for joy"" to the acousric front porch blues of"" cherry tree"". there are two instrumentals and the great song for long time friend frank forst"" so long frank forst"" a great tribute to along time friend."
4,back to the bayou,"from the opening track ""jump for joy"" to the beautiful track ""so lomg frank"" tribute to the late frank forst cd is full of great mix of swamp boogie blues"
4,rhk,"This is an intense, historical war drama, very well written. V.A.Stewart captures the tremendous hardship these regional conflicts impose on civilians and military alike. While not being overly graphic the reader is immersed on the battle field and is left to marvel at how he writer could recreate the past so vividly."
5,"Great understated redemption story, well told, with humor.","In addition to the often mentioned humor and twists of plot in Chris Moore's Coyote Blue, there is a very well done story of a life lost and redeemed.Somewhere early on in the story I became aware, almost subconciously, of the saddness of the protagonist's plight. Forced to deny his personal identity, one out of the mainstream of the society he is forced to spend his life in, Sam's highly developed coping skills are just beginning to crack when the Trickster appears. The zany antics of the Trickster only contribute to Sam's redemption.Moore's development of this aspect of the plot is really remarkable as it manages to come through, in a subtle yet relentless manner, in the midst of all the other elements of the story. This is an indication of how developed is Moore's writing technique and no small tribute to his stroy telling skill. This book works very well on several levels"
3,"Entertaining, but Mr. Moore has done better","I read Coyote Blue after reading Lamb and Fluke, two books I found witty and wonderful. In fact, just yesterday I gave a friend a ""money back"" guarantee that if he didn't like Lamb, I'd buy it from him... and it was the third book at Border's in a buy three for the price of two deal!I wouldn't make this bet with Coyote Blue. It had its good points, but it was a much weaker story. Why? Perhaps because it had a narrower focus... legends of the Crow tribe. Women didn't some across as particularly strong characters either, as opposed to Fluke and Lamb.So... 3 stars instead of 4, and I'll be careful on Moore's other books... they obviously vary in their quality. Oh, and have I already suggested that you DO read Lamb and Fluke?"
4,You can run but you can't hide,"Moore does an excellent job of blending the legend of Coyote, Crow history and folklore, and reservation life into this funny and lighthearted tale about Sam Hunter, who runs away from his Indian heritage and invents a new life for himself until Coyote, the Indian God trickster shows up to wreak havoc on his life, putting into action a series of events that cause Sam to face his past.The story moves fast and I enjoyed the writing style. I read The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove, and this book is MUCH better.Well worth reading."
4,Great job Mr. Moore!,"I have been reading my way through the works of Christopher Moore and Coyote Blue was one of the highlites along the way. The retelling of ancient stories and the making up of some new ones makes this story move in an easy direction. Like many other of Moore's books, there are some laugh out loud moments and many times where I didn't want to put the book down. This was a great read, thanks!"
4,"Quirky, Fast, Fun Read",This book was a great little diversion from what I should have been accomplishing one day! It was fun. I got a few chuckles and really enjoyed the characters.
3,My least favorite Moore novel,"I've read many of Christopher Moore's books (Lamb, Dirty Job, Angel, Demonkeeping, the vampire pair,...) and I have to say Coyote Blue is the least entertaining of the lot. There is the usual odd collection of characters and twisted humor I've come to love about his books, but I found my self not at all interested in how the plot would unfold, just that it would finally be over. If you're new to Moore, I'd suggest skipping this one for now and start with any one of his other books."
4,I love the Humor,This is a different type of book than I would normally read. My friend gave it to me and I read through it in a few hours.Moore has a interesting and satirical sense of humor. I look forward to reading more of his work
4,"Totally different story, but same fun","I haven't read his books in order so I see characters appearing that appear in other works which I really like. This story was very different for subject, but still the same Christopher Moore. Wacky characters mixed in with the allegedly sane, adventures, sort of a good vs. evil - themes I've seen in all his books. I enjoyed how the story and the main character came full circle as well. It's a fun tale full of it's share of surpasses."
4,More Good Times,This book is about Par for the course with his other books. It is a story of nonsense with some sex drugs and death. Its a twist from reality that will make you smile page after page. If you have never read another of his books I would highly recommend him to anyone with an open mind in need of an escape from boring old life!
1,Do not compare this guy to Tom Robbins or Kurt Vonnegut,"I picked up this book because I've heard Christopher Moore compared to Tom Robbins and Kurt Vonnegut. Tom Robbins is one of my favorite authors and I think Vonnegut is alright too...All I want to say is that, in my opinion, it's insulting to Robbins and Vonnegut for Christopher Moore to be lumped into their, um, genera. If you're a Robbins fan, make sure to read some of this book at the bookstore before you buy it to make sure you're not wasting your money... One thought, check out ""The Monkey Wrench Gang,"" I recently read it and liked it a lot."
1,Not particularly amused.,"I have to admit that despite my love for A Dirty Job, I'm not a big fan of Moore's earlier works. Not only are some characters reused (which I don't really have a problem with -- nothing wrong with recurring characters!), he uses some of the same stereotypes in every book, it seems. There's always a mostly-high surfer dude. There's always a cantankerous (and probably homely) old lady. And of course, the earnest (if sometimes misguided) main character. I think what really rubbed me wrong in this book was Coyote himself. I know he is supposed to be a ""trickster"" spirit, but I found him more mean-spirited than anything. Especially when he steals Sam's car, sells it, and gambles away his bank account. I think you're supposed to find his naiveté endearing, but I didn't. I'll keep reading (or rather, listening) to Moore's books, but mostly because they're what my husband wants to hear."
3,"Didn't hate it, didn't love it",I bought this because some people compared it to Tom Robbin's great books which are intelligent and thought-provoking and hilarious. Not even close. Lots of the parts that are supposed to be funny seem very tortured and unoriginal. The best parts are about Native American spirituality. I could live without the characters. I don't dislike this book but I am disappointed because it didn't live up to some of the reviews I read from other readers. Thought I should warn the rest of you Tom Robbins fans.
4,How do you pass up a book that has a coyote humpin' a couch?,"You don't. (Then again you could and miss out on a brave, quick, sensual, hilarious read. But then that would be your problem."
2,Funny????,"I've come to expect that Christopher Moore will be a very good, if very wacky yarn spinner. Here he writes what I suppose could be characterized as a kind of biography of the main character, but it doesn't hold together. I've put it down several times, pretty much with the remark of, ""So &%$@ what?"" The coyote god is not amusing, simply annoying; and I'd swear the hero is on peyote at least. There are a few amusing moments, and some luscious use of English, but no belly laughs. It's almost mechanical, as though Moore's publisher nagged him to get something--anything--written. Didn't like this one at all."
5,great big fun,"I truly enjoyed this book. Fun, adventure, and zen auto repair. Watch out for Coyote, he might just change your mind."
4,Quite a journey,"Coyote, all instinct and nerve, is that mystical voice we sometimes hear, but often ignore. Moore's ability to shape a story is very impressive and while comparisons to Tom Robbins are easy, it is Moore's smooth plot transitions that make him seem, to me, a more agile writer. I was only recently introduced to Christopher Moore...what a fortunate discovery."
5,And I don't give 5 stars easily,"This book has a lot going for it: laughter, native American culture, modern American sociology, love. It made me read all of Moore's stuff, and re-read Coyote Blue three more times. I loaned the book to my best friends and they all loved it. If you are American (or want to know about Americans) and like fun, you'll love this one."
4,somewhere between Vonnegut and Tom Robbins...,"Clever and interesting and entertaining and funny. However, I shouldn't have read the author's _Lamb_ first, because it set the bar really high. Now, the books of his that I have read all have yet to meet that bar, although they are of an above average quality for light entertainment.Moore lacks something though, and I can't place it. His style is somewhere between Vonnegut and Tom Robbins. Instead of being a synthesis of these two writers (who I enjoy), he feels vaguely like a degenerative version of them."
3,Fun read,"Loved the satire in this book. Coyote exhasperates the main character throughout the entire book. The ending, though, I thought a bit too tidy, and unrealistic, but then again, a coyote who comes to life as a spirit guide is pretty unrealistic anyway."
4,"Good, but tablets are quite large","I'd previously tried the Vetri-science probiotic treats for my puppy, which he devoured!These canine supplements are fine - they do the job, but puppy is not too fussed about these large tablets (although he is quite a picky customer). Usually, I break it up in his food, and to their credit - he'll eventually eat it. I wish they came in a smaller, more puppy friendly form though."
4,Not the best for small older dogs maybe??,"I won't give this a bad review because my dog is small, but we bought this huge bucket and he really doesn't seem to like these. I don't know if its the taste or the texture; they seem quite hard and he is getting up there in age. Anyhow, its a struggle to get him to eat these so we will likely give the bucket to our neighbor and their 75lb pit bull; I imagine a larger, younger dog will gobble these up!"
4,"Captivating, Sensual, Ethereal","This soundtrack will take you to a place deep within you that you keep hidden, ""captive."" It opens your aura to all levels of emotional depths and you can just dissapear for awhile when listening it. I have never heard anything like this CD before. Deeply moving -- think deep thoughts when listening to it."
5,A Discussion For Anyone With Breast Cancer - Superior video,"This is a great video! Breast cancer survivors share memories of their journey from diagnosis to recovery. The videotape covers specific information about choices for reconstruction after mastectomy. Includes medial animation of breast conservation/lumpectomy, tissue expanders and both silicone and saline implants. In addition, two autogenous procedures are explained: latissimus dorsi flap and transverse rectus abdominus mycutaneous flap. Guided by medical experts from the fields of surgical oncology, plastic surgery and hematology, the videotape offers reliable information from many disciplines. The medical information is combined with the real life experiences of women on the job and interacting with their families. Real photos of surgical patients are shown both before and after reconstruction. Powerfully told by breast cancer survivors, the videotape offers a hopeful view of life after breast cancer."
4,Goosebumps: Monster Blood by R.L STINE,"This book is about a kid named Evan that stays with his great aunt Kathryn. He stays there because his parents went to look for a better home in Atlanta. While staying with his weird aunt, he meets a girl named Andy. Andy wants to go to a old toy store, so Evan goes with her.Evan finds in a shelf in dust a can of monster blood. He buys it and plays with it. His dog plays and likes it too much he eats some. Evan then sees that the monster blood is growing and now he has a big appetite.I like this book because it's exciting and not boring. I like it too because it's a scary story. All the people in the story stay in character. I hope you read this book later in the future."
4,very good book,"monster blood is a great book.It is about Evan Ross and his friend Andy [who are the to caracters in this book].They both went to an old store, but evan was the one who bought the monster blood....."
4,"Blood, blood, everywhere....","When Evan Ross goes to his Aunt Kaythrn's house he finds an old store. Then he buys a can labeled: MONSTER BLOOD. At first, the Monster Blood is fun to play with especailly for his friend, Andy. But then a strange thing starts to happen. The Monster Blood keeps on growing, and growing, and growing...."
4,Goosebumps 3,"The book I read was Monster Blood III by R.L. Stine. Some main characters are Andy, Even and Kermit. Kermit is eight, Andy is really Andrea, and Evan is Kermit's cousin. Kermit gets Evan in trouble, and messes around with chemicals in his basement/ lab. Evan receives Monster Blood in the mail. It is something like candy that makes you grow. I would recommend this book to any of my friends willing to read this four star book. I hope you read this book."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It was a very cool book about a gooey,green substance that grows and grows and becomes outta control. It is a very good book, if you like suprise endings and adveture books."
5,Getting rid of Monster Blood is very hard.,"Man, this book brings back memories. I read it when it first came out. It was my favorite goosebump book in the series. Particularly becuase I loved the plot. A boy gets a can of goo-like substance that can't stop growing. It really made my imagination grow. Very clear descriptions and a very weird plot."
3,OK ! !,THE BOOK IS GOOD.YOU SHOULD READ IT.IT ISNT SO BAD.BUT IF YOU WANT READSOMETHING REALY SCARY THEN DONT READ IT.
4,It's Alive.,"MONSTER BLOOD is about a twelve year-old boy named Evan Ross who is forced to spend a few weeks with his deaf great aunt. Evan's father is being transferred to Atlanta, Georgia and the only person who can watch Evan while his parents are househunting is great aunt Kathryn. One day while on a visit to an old toy store with his new found friend, Andy, Evan buys a can of stuff called ""Monster Blood"". Evan doesn't think much of it and he and Andy spend the afternoon playing with the green silly putty-type substance. However, as time goes on the monster blood begins to grow and starts to act like its alive.I enjoyed reading MONSTER BLOOD. It was pretty short and not too scary. It also had an unusual twist at the end."
4,Monster Blood,Monster blood Is a good book if you like the series goosebumps. It is about a kid who goes to his grandmothers while his mom and dad go to Atlanta.While his mom and dad are gone he goes and buys a bottle full of green goow. TRHe person who owns the store tals the kid I wouldn`t buy that. then he gets home and his dog start to eat some of the greengoow. the green goow eats everone inthe house.
5,Conor L,"This one is book #3 and called 'Monster Blood'. It's a four-part story. 'Monster Blood' is about a kid named Evan Ross. His family is moving to Atlanta, and he has to stay with his great Aunt while his parents are picking out a new house. Aunt Kathryn lives with her black cat Sarabeth. Then Evan meets a girl named Andy, and they become friends. They go to an toy store and find a can of Monster Blood. They think it's a fun toy, so they buy it. But it turns out that the can of Monster Blood is real and it starts to grow and grow and will not stop growing! I don't want to ruin the ending for you so you'd better go read it to find out what happens to them!"
2,"Just another ""magic"" green florescent goo book?","When the goo comes alive... it is pretty stupid.My scale on these children's books is simple:Would I give this book to my own kid to read?In this case the answer is no.My reasons:1) Magic is confused with chemistry and science in this book.2) Carl Sagan talked about the ""Demon infested world"":I don't think such ideas should be perpetuated as myths to our children as in this book.They can study myths later..."
1,Eeeek. I want my money back,"This book is about a famous heart-throb (Rylan) who moves in with a woman (Kirsten) who wrote the screenplay for his latest movie. The movie is about her late husband's life and death. Rylan moves in to learn more about him and in the meantime, he falls in love with Kirsten.The problem is, the story and the characters lack depth. The reader never gets to understand why these two people liked each other. They never even got to know each other. Every chapter is the same scenario; Kirsten avoiding Rylan and Rylan rethinking his every move like a 16 year old boy in heat.I am no longer going to blindly purchase a book because Sandra Brown's name is on the cover."
3,Thought Provoking!,"This was one of Sandra Brown's earlier books before she made it big and it was reprinted in hardcover. Rylan North is the famous actor chosen to act the part in Kirsten Dumm biographical portrait of her husband. When he asked to come and stay with her so he can channel her husband she is against it, and so begins this tug and war between the starcrossed lovers. She eventually allows him to stay with her. He then starts to fall for her but he is not sure if her feelings for him is real or if she is channeling her husband's love on him. Interesting read, I have read better titles by the author, but I enjoyed this because I always like seeing the hero fighting for the woman. Unlike my fellow reviewers I did not buy it i borrowed it from the local library and even if I did buy it I think it would be worth the cash."
2,Demon Rumm,"Demon Rumm was a stunt pilot that perished in the air. His late wife Kirsten has written a book on his life, and is not happy when Hollywood wants to turn it into their next blockbuster. After negotiations are complete, she is resigned to having the lead actor underfoot for a time. Ryland North is the actor chosen to play Demon, and he feels that to get in character, he must live and breathe his life.I liked the story, but didn't feel the emotion or chemistry between Ryland and Kirsten. It felt forced."
3,"Early Book, Now In Hardback","I guess the hardcover format led me to expect more than this early Sandra Brown reprint could deliver. I became impatient with the smouldering looks, hints at secrets and other lures to spice up the romance potential. This is a pretty ordinary formula romance.I found the ""bad boy"" actor incredibly pushy and to me that just wasn't sexy. Maybe worth a nostolgia reading for Sandra Brown's diehard fans who will overlook its shallowness."
3,OK for an early Brown,"OK is about all I can say. Yes, this is an early Brown but not even up to the standard she set early on. I was bored thoughout most of the book and put-off by how Rylan kept advancing into personal space even when asked specifically not to.I am glad that I have this to add to my Sandra Brown hardback collection but unless you are a collector...wait for the paperback."
2,don't waste your time or money,I ordered this book not realising it was nearly 20years old. Misleading to state it's publishing date as 2005. It's a re issue and I only read it hoping it would improve along the way. Which it didn't. Save your money and time. Give this one a miss!!!
2,This is not up to par,I usually find Sandra Brown's books page turning. This one was definitely not a page turner. In fact I'm struggling to finish it. I can't figure out why every chapter is the same scenario in different words. There appears to be no story here at all.
2,Don't waste your money...,"This one was just okay; it didn't `WOW' me. I too was misled by the hardback reprint. I thought surely they wouldn't go through all the trouble to re-release if it wasn't good. I was sorely mistaken. I dropped 20 bucks, so needless to say I'm a little salty ... I thought this would be a better read. It's very slow. Not worth a dime...borrow, don't buy. And don't set the bar past 3 on a 10 scale, or this book won't reach it."
2,Demon Rumm,I got this book because I usually buy anything Sandra Brown. But I did not like it. I'm sorry to say I did not finish the book.
2,Demon Rumm by Sandra Brown,"I have read several of Sandra Brown's earlier romances and really liked them, this one not so much. The characters didn't seem well developed and came across as flat. I could not really care about them or their story which just seemed awkward to me."
3,Demon Rumm,I was trying to catch up on some of Sandra Brown's older books that I had not read. I really want to thank booksellingman72 for his prompt response. The book arrived in the condition as stated and in a timely manner. Melanie Turner
3,Not one of her best,"As a huge fan of SB, i found this book falling short of her later offerings. I did find it pleasant enough to read in under 24 hours, but it didnt hold much drama and intrigue."
2,BORING!,"The main character was really annoying! I hated her! Then the self centered actor hired to play her husband was on his way to being somewhat likeable, but then he just turned into a total whimp. I was really disappointed with this one."
4,Quick note,"Daniel Quinn mentions this book in his ""Providence."" Speaking about his life as a Trappist in KY he says, ""Merton lent me a copy of Max Picard's The World of Silence, a wonderful book, a whole book on silence, and nothing I could say in praise of silence could begin to equal it."""
2,Extraordinarily stingy record of wonderful concert,"Search out the concert video of this, and then burn a cd of its soundtrack. There's just too much good stuff on it that wasn't put on this disc to make the cd a purchase you'll be happy with. Pete looks and sounds great, being content to be the bandleader and leave the guitar heroics to David Gilmour (yes, *that* David Gilmour). MIA here are a fun, relaxed, big-band version of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", an even more fun acoustic singalong of ""Magic Bus"", and a hilariously screeching rendition of ""I Put A Spell On You."" If the powers that be are content to let a major film statement of The Who like _The Kids Are Alright_ drift in and out of availability, in mutilated form, then I guess there's not a lot of hope for getting a reissue of the Deep End concert. But you'll kick yourself if you settle for this."
4,Great Show,The full concert IS available on CD. Townshend released it a year or two ago on his Signature Series of CD's. [...] along with some other shows and specialty items.
3,Need a re-release with more tracks,"This is a great effort, however, the content is limited. Since Pete provided another release of the Brixton concert, with all of the songs, it seems a re-release of ""Deep End"" with more tracks would be a good idea. For example, the Brixton live version of ""A Little is Enough"" is far better than the studio version on ""Empty Glass"".A five star concert rates only three stars because it is edited down to only one CD.How about a 25th anniversary 2-CD set, Pete? And while you are at it, a 25th anniversary DVD would be in order."
3,JustDave,"I have to agree with the critics on this album, but the standout version of ""Save if for later"" may be worth the price of admission. Give that a listen, but don't expect quite as much from the other tracks."
3,Photo Explosion is just OK,I guess I was looking for something that can compete with with Paint Shop Pro even if on a lower level. Photo Explosion is interesting but definitely can't compete.
4,To Live or Relive an Era,"For those growing up around the time of World War II, this brings back a lot of memories -- not all of them perfect. The author covers radio premiums, comic books, novelty catalogues, pulp magazines, and Big Little Books, among other things -- all items kids of the era had interest in. Photographs of the premiums are enlarged, so they seem about the same size as kids would remember them being. The author makes a few minor mistakes (e.g., the TV Captain Midnight premiums were ""decoders,"" not ""Code-O-Graphs"") but all in all has provided an entertaining reminiscence of a time long gone, alas."
4,Informative & well-written,"I bought this book for a class in Holistic Health Practices. It is well organized and well written. It is a little boring to read, because there are no illustrations or graphs. It gives a very good overview of all the alternative medical systems from acupuncture, ayurveda, chiropractic, osteopathy, homeopathy, etc., explaining how each system evolved, how it sees the patient and how it treats illnesses and which conditions it is good for. I highly recommend it if you are interested in taking charge of your health via alternative medicine or to supplement what western medicine can do for you."
1,Just a rehash,"This book is basically just a rehash of Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide by Burton Goldberg, only not nearly as complete or useful as that book. In fact, a careful reading will show that Trivieri's book contains sections that are just rewrites of information from the Guide. The Goldberg book goes into much more detail (including plenty of references to back up the material) and also includes a large section on treating specific health conditions - something Trivieri's book doesn't have at all. Not recommended."
4,Great Just as a Press,"Although marketed as a press plus freezer storage tool, I've always used it just as a press. Both pieces are fairly heavy nonstick plastic. You load the ""cup"" with a meat blob, a lot or a little. I usually press the meat into the edges a little to predistribute it. Then press as hard as you like with the plunger. Flip the cup over and the patty slips right out. The diameter seems a little large but after grilling, the burgers are just about perfect. I've been using this gadget for over 10 years and see no reason to upgrade. A very good product for a good price."
3,cheaper options available,"I bought this despite the price, thinking it would make 5"" patties based on the description and other review comments about it making larger patties. But it makes 4.5"" patties, same as most of the other presses available on Amazon. 4.5"" is a bit on the small side if you want your burger to fill the bun and are not using lean ground beef, so I've been looking for a 5"" press.There are lots of < $10 burger presses available that will work just as well or better than this one, so unless you just absolutely have to have the containers this product is massively overpriced. I'm returning it."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"After using Tupperware products nearly all my life, I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I am with this product AND with the customer service I received from the company.I purchased this item directly from Tupperware. I followed the directions that say ""top rack dishwasher safe"". After one washing, I closed the container, and could not open it againt unless I used a screwdriver to force it open. Why? Because the clasp warped in the dishwasher!Tupperware will not replace items that melt or warp. They didn't care that I followed their washing/care instructions. They said they'd sent me a replacement set, IF I gave them five dollars for shipping. Why would I want another set it the same thing is going to happen to them in the dishwasher?Unless you want to wash these by hand constantly, and unless you want to pack a screwdriver in your kids lunch box so they can pry their sandwich out, this product is truly useless."
5,Annie and the Sand Dobbies,"My father gave me this book when he was dying of cancer. I was 8, I am 56 and sadly was thinking about a child and death. I suddenly remembered what this book had meant to me. I highly recommend it. I am happy to know it is still in print."
3,More of the same,"Hmm.. more of the same if you ask me. It all sounds pretty cool and all but I expected a bit more innovation, especially if you consider the years between this album and the one before."
1,Not so good,Don't waste your money. Anyone that listens to this more than once or twice is in desperate need of a brain transplant.
2,Sorry Underworld lovers...,"...but I really did not like this album. Yes...it is my opinion and I respect yours, blah blah, but I must have my say.I bought this CD on an impulse buy once, because of one or two songs (I think maybe 'Cups', or 'Jumbo') but the rest of the CD just pissed me off to no end...People talk about the complexity in the music...what complexity? It is just loops and loops with variations so conservative, one wonders if the musical complexity did exist on this album. As Richard D. James (Aphex Twin) put it so perfectly, Underworld is ""watered-down music."" Especially this album.If you want complexity, musical genius, and pure, unabashed originality, then check out the man above, Aphex Twin. But it is not for the faint of heart...so maybe you Underworld fans should stay away :POf course, if this is your kind of thing...fine by me! But really, musical complexity? On THIS album?"
2,. . . but that depends,"If you want super pretentious mood music with laughable stabs at poetry, then this will suit the bill. To be fair, there is a lot here to enjoy. Just precious little to dance to. I was gravely disappointed. Maybe they're just changing and I'm not along for the ride, but I found exactly one track here to enjoy."
2,What happened?,"dubnobasswithmyheadman is one of my all-time favorite albums. Their early music was so soothing and original, no other band has so successfully pulled off what dubnobass did. I truly commend Underworld for creating such beautiful music. Sadly, Underworld has gone down from there. This album features immature beats with uninspired synth. Their calming songs are not calming, and their hard songs are repititious at best. In dubnobass, the vocals were musical instruments in themselves, giving their songs a unique feel. In Fish, the vocals are completely ridiculous and just distract from the already drab music. If you loved their early stuff, then I doubt you will like this, so be cautious. A couple good tracks, but not worth the money. Maybe buy it used but I would not suggest ordering it."
3,A disappointing follow-up to Second Toughest of the Infants,"Wow, what a disappointment. In an effort to resemble an electronic rock group Underworld abandons the strong instrumentals of Second Toughest for Karl Hyde's vocals on every track. Problem is, he only has something to say on a few songs.While the disc opens well with Cups, Push Upstairs, and Jumbo, which are on compilations everywhere, nothing else really sparkles. Some tracks are strong enough to be listenable, but the vocals drag them down.You're probably better off getting their boxed singles set than this if you like Underworld."
4,Everybody has forgotten.....(read to find out),"Beacoup fish is awesome, i think im going to check out born slippy thing everybody's talking about, but otherwise i have to say moaner is the most amazing techno ive heard in a while, you cant survive that song without a reaction, i strongly recommend orbital #2 to everyone on here, more techno-ey, great album, beacoup fish is solid though, i have picky taste, and im not one of those people thats only into techno, my taste stretch from korn to billy joel, this is solid music"
2,Disappointed,I listened to 'toughest in the infants' everyday for a month but there are only 2 tracks on this one that I like. I'd recommend checking out the samples or listening to a friends copy before buying this one.
1,"Another ""one good song"" disk","King of Snake (minus the intro and ""prologue"") is great. (Well, even the intro and prologue are ok). Good song. The rest of the CD stinks. I paid more at Virgin so buy it here if you're going to buy it at all. But know you're buying one song. : ""eruptions of ecstatic melody""?? pleeze! did someone throw up?"
3,Mediocre,"Underworld might be inovative and not afraid to mix the genre's with very fresh sounds. ""Born Slippy"" was on of the best things to come out in 1996. However, i don't feel that ""Beaucoup Fish"" is that special. The hit single ""Push Upstairs"" for example, was repetitive and dull. I took a closer look at the album and there were a few good songs on this album though. ""Jumbo"" a slow quite beautiful song. Same with ""Wijner"" and ""King of Snake"" which is a meliodic dj with cool beats, very inovative and still fresh. ""Moaner"" and especially ""Something like a mama"" is drum and bass, nothing new but allright. The album had a few moments but it doesn't give anything new either, many songs are too repetitive and too ordinary aswell. There are certainly other electro bands that has created better albums then this, hence even Underworld themselves."
4,Night and the city.,"Underworld's best album offers the familiar formula - long, early-morning, neon-dazed soundscapes of numbed calm punctuated by staccato spurts of violence, back-dropping Karl Hyde's bravely unflattering and unsexy fragments of sex, night and the city - is tightened by jazzy rhythms, and energised by drum'n' bass. It might miss the point to highlight individual tracks in an album designed as a multi-mood unity, but opening 'Cups' sets the tone, 12 minutes of slow-burning tension scraped by shards of shrill noise; the clanking 'Bruce Lee', the closest thing here to a pop single; while closer 'Moaner' ante-ups the creepy aggression."
2,Yawn.,"I was extremely disappointed with this album. It's a sad ghost of the genius of Underworld's previous efforts - mildly interesting at best, housey and grating at worst. I listened to it with clenched teeth the first couple times and put it away - it's not the kind of album that'll grow on you. Do yourself a favor and go buy Second Toughest in the Infants or one of their singles instead."
5,Awesome!,"I didn't think that they would be able to do justice to another album after Second Toughest, but they did! Even better was the concert they put on at St. Andrew's Hall in Detroit, MI. A sold out show for about 500 people...unbelievable that they would grace us with this surprise performance!"
2,"2 killer cuts, the rest is forgettable.","The 2 standouts cuts are Cups and Jumbo, which quite fankly are the best things you'll hear all year. The rest is terribly, terribly unimaginative. Try listening to 808 State's ""Don Solaris"" instead."
4,"Underworld's newest release ""kicks the llama's ass.""","Since I first fell in love with singles like ""Born Slippy"" and ""Pearl's Girl"", I have felt the intensity of Underworld. They do electronica like Zeppelin does the blues; constantly changing and never asking for forgiveness. Underworld's Beaucoup Fish is upbeat and downbeat all throughout the album. Even though there is alot of dance material, you will want to find a comfortable place to sit and listen to the whole album, preferably very little light. Put on a pair of headphones if necessary so you won't be interrupted. This album grabs you by the ears and locks into your head like a terminal brain disease. Once you've got a case of it, you can't shake it. There are also elements of comedy such as the song ""Jumbo"", which if you've heard it you'll know about the dialogue at the track's beginning. You'll fall in love with this album. Underworld's mission is to catch a beaucoup of fish...Enjoy!"
3,"Overall, a decent effort...","Although this album is good in general, the group's excessive use of repetitive rhythms and melodies drag a couple of tracks down quite a bit (especially on the long ones). Still, on other tracks, the ambience and slower grooves make the album worthwhile. Even though ""Beaucoup Fish"" isn't that much different from ""Second Toughest In The Infants"", it's still worth a listen."
3,"Yucky & Boring, 'cept for Mama & Snake","Fish doesn't live up to the sheer quality of Toughest in the Infants. Fish is full of repetitive (but original) beats that get boring quick. Made for the floor. Would've benefited from some more synth work.However, it's worth buying just for SOMETHING LIKE A MAMA and KING OF SNAKE. I wake up every morning humming those tunes -- very catchy -- very nice. MAMA should be the next single.There is no STAGGER on this album. There's no JUANITA/KITELESS. If you want an OUTSTANDING FIVE-STAR disc, pass this one up & Get Second Toughest in the Infants.And get the new ORBITAL disc from AMAZON when it comes out in June. (stateside) The song NOWHERE TO RUN is incredible. See http://www.hyperreal.org/loopz for Orbital track samples."
3,It could have been a brilliant career...,"This is a good cd EXCEPT for some reason many of the songs have been ruined by bogus vocals. Most of the tunes are very repetitive, which is OK, but the maddening part is that the songs that WOULD be good have frankly moronic lyrics about things like ""a vest sale at Walmart""! I can't stop questioning why they felt they HAD to add words. Some of the songs sound great, until they open their mouths and the integrity plummets."
4,"good, but not great","Excellent album, but not in the same league as ""second toughest"", standout tracks are ""cups"", ""jumbo"" and ""kittens"" which have that anthemic tone to them with melodic soothing sounds, a great CD to do stuff to, like driving or reading. Not a patch on their earlier efforts but still worth buying."
2,Person who has the CD,"This album is not so good in my opinion, Jumbo is the only song you really would want to listen to more than once. But even Jumbo is hardly undestandable but the the rhythim to the beat is pretty good."
5,Essential stuff,"This album, apart from ""Bruce Lee""(just weird), is a familiar but different sound to their previous albums. BF totally pumps, the bass is killer and the tunes are just groovy. Buy it. Now"
2,Very disappointing,"After listening to this cd for a month or two, and waiting to be blown away by it as I was by ""dubnobass..."" and ""second toughest"" I have come to the conclusion that it is simply not as good. There are some good grooves, and some nice bits, and it's certainly better than most other stuff out there, but it cannot even hold a candle to the other two Underworld albums. None of the beauty and transcendance is there, the songs are not as good. It seems like these guys just ran out of steam. Oh well, that doesn't take away from the fact that they made two of the most beautiful and important electronic-dance-music albums of the 90's. Two out of three ain't bad i guess."
4,Snake fighting,This is a really good cd. Some of the songs are a little jazzy. There are some melodic songs that I really like and only a couple slower songs.Overall very good and a little different from the norm.
4,Beacoup Fish,"Beacoup Fish being Underworld's 5th studio album and 1999 was very anticipated after their landmark recording seconf toughest in the infants and is a great album if not as good and I agree with Allmusic when they give this album 4/5. 4 singles were realeased from the album, i.e., ""Push Upstairs"", ""Jumbo"", ""Bruce Lee"" and ""Moaner"". The booklet is quite sparse and contains no lyrics and no photographs. 4/5."
5,Can't get much better that this,"amazing from start to finish, and back again, day after day, month after month. The amazingly long and rambling (but genius) ""Cups"", the incredible ""King Of Snake"", and the mindblowing ""Kittens"" are eternal parts of my DJing set (even in the same night!) and will be for a long time to come. All the other tracks are incredibly great. Worth it, worth it, worth it. Even if you're nothing but a ""Fatboy"" fan you'll love this."
4,"Good fiction for young adults, particularly females","Normally i wouldn't read a book meant for junior high school students; however, a friend recommended it to me and though I expected it to be a sappy, typical, cliche girl-girl novel, it turned out to be pretty good. Landis' ability to develop his characters' feelings, personality, and thoughts throughout this book is most remarkable, especially with the lead character Judy. Though this book appeals more to young females it shouldn't be classified as a musician's book, even though it uses music as more than just a backdrop, it deals with the complexities of ones emotions and how people deal with pain, love, and anger."
5,Easy to Sail,This is an excellent product. Someone with decent knowledge of sailing can zip all over the place on a large pond or small lake. Very responsive and easy to use. Easy to put together. My 13 year old son who is a beginning sailor was able to operate this sailboat. Durable and very attractive. Strongly recommend.
2,Elusive goal,"I have been trying to find masking tape that does not remove paint from sheetrock. I use only Benjamin Moore paints, and 3M's blue painter's tape in both medium adhesion as well as low-medium adhesion remove paint from drywall. 3M lists a low adhesion tape on their website, however, it is impossible to find on the net as well as locally. I had hoped Loparex's Easy Mask would solve the paint removal dilemma. It has not. The Easy Mask results mirror those of 3M's blue painter's tape. To be clear, not every inch of applied tape removes paint. However, enough paint is removed to render time spent painting nearly an excersize in futility."
3,SAY IT AIN'T SO...,"EPMD DISPLAYS LYRICAL STORMS,BATTLE FORM.THERE ARE DUOS OUT WHO SELL MORE,BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO DROPPING LETHAL LYRICAL STORMS,THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.STRICTLY,UNFINISH,USUAL,PERSONAL,AND BACK TO BUSINESS.NOW IT IS OVER,OUT OF BUSINESS.THIS ALBUM IS VERY GOOD.THE E-DOUBLE AND PMD ARE THE DUO MASTERS AND SHOW WHY.THE BEATS ARE VERY GOOD BUT NOT AS DEEP AS A EPMD ALBUM.YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ALBUM.EPMD-THEY WILL BE BACK."
3,Only true EPMD fans will appreciate this CD.,"I like many EPMD fans were anxiously waiting for this CD to be released. Especially since ""Right Now"" and ""Symphony"" were just blazin', blazin' tracks. So since this is supposedly the last EPMD joint, I had to pick it up. ""The Fan"", ""U got shot"", and ""Jane 6"" were hot, but the CD drags other than the first 2 selections I mentioned. It seemed like a hurried release. Erick Sermon is by no comparison, THE MOST UNDERRATED, and maybe even most UNAPPRECIATED M.C. in the rap game. Yet even he has done better in the past. Hope we see a solo release from both Erick & Parrish in 2000!"
3,This won't let you down!,"This is much like the album Back In Business by EPMD, which is also a good album. A good album by a classic duo!"
2,Close the doors...fire sale on airplay hits,EPMD got more airplay on their arguments and beef than they did on the music from this album and for valid reasons as it showed that the course had run dry.
5,Business is GOOD!,"Once again, EPMD has managed to combine lyrical genius with that ill hip-hop flavor that so many artists lack these days. Unlike its title, EPMD's ""Out of Business"", will not be going anywhere but up. This group has continued to expand and blow up the spot once again. A must have for all true hip-hoppers. They're definately keepin it real, especially with their album-release hit ""Symphony 2000"" feat. the untouchable ""Method Man"". The combination is another platinum track... go 'head EPMD!"
1,Wack Trash,"EPMD is a legendary group and have dropped consistent albums and a couple of classics for over a decade...It has 2 DECENT songs in Pioneer and Right Now. and 2 GOOD songs in both versions of Symphony. The rest is pure filler. the only other song that is listenable is THe Fan. Even the usually good Jane song is wack. They retired as a group on a bad note. And if this was gonna be what they were going to put out from then on then it was the GREATEST choice to retire in Hip Hop history with the exception of Mase. If you have to have every EPMD album then dont make the mistake I did and buy this album without the Greatest Hits Cd.( How dumb was that). At least buy the one with the greatest hit cd included, that way it wont be a complete waste of money."
3,Buy this with the greatest hits not alone,"this cd alone is good for the price i got it for which is $2 if you pay regular price for this cd i would say that was a waste of money this cd seems unexcited or lazy except the track with m.o.p. get it with greatest hitsFavorite Track:Symphony feat M.O.P.Guests:M.O.P,Lady Luck,Redman,Method Man,Busta Rhymesremember this is the review of the cd without greatest hits5 of 10 lyrics 6 of 10 beats"
5,Everyone should read this book.,"An open-minded reading of this book will change the way you think about yourself and everyone you know. It's not just about identical twins, but about all of us, and what makes us who we are. I've read many books about twin research, and this is the best."
2,Poorly written,"I am very interested in twin studies and I enjoyed reading Wright's Remembering Satan, so I had positive expectations for this book. Unfortunately, it is so poorly written that the writing distracted from the content. It seems hastily patched together and poorly edited. The book is an expansion of the original New Yorker article, but in my opinion it adds little of value to the original."
2,Mission traveler,"Very well presented. Good,colorful pictures but generally I felt the video lacked the historical and in-depth information on each of the 21 missions that I was looking for."
1,This was one of the worst books I've ever read!,"I picked up this book with high hopes. As a bottlefeeding mom, I looked forward to recieving some helpful tips and affrimation. What a rude shock! Rather than support moms who either need or choose formula, the author spends over two thirds of the book harshly critisizing everything from stay at home moms to cloth diaper users and of course those ""evil breastfeeding cultists."" This book made me ashamed to admit to using bottles. It's no wonder people make all kinds of assumptions about bottlefeeding moms (being selfish, stupid, etc.). If this is the only book in our defense, who wouldn't reach the same conclusion? This piece of hateful trash is the last thing any mother needs to read."
1,too bad she doesn't really help people,"As a mother who has both bottle and breastfed, I find this book disturbing. You can get better information with the packets in the hospital. This book is filled with wrong information, and if you didn't know you should feel guilty about bottle feeding you will when you read this!"
1,Angry mom lashes out irrationally,"Rehash of her 1995 book. An all-out assault on breastfeeding advocacy by a mother whose breastfeeding experience was sabotaged by bad medical advice. Instead of directing her anger at the doctors who destroyed her breastfeeding relationship, she rants and rails at breastfeeding advocates and calls them ""cultists"" Full of harmful misinformation."
1,Hatefulness is not reassuring!,"Reading this book feels like drinking acid. The irrational anger of the author toward breastfeeding mothers and advocates is absolutely overpowering. This is not a reassuring guide for anyone. Whether you are bottlefeeding or breastfeeding or just trying to decide, I suggest you just leave this book off your shelf. No one needs to inject this kind of negativity into her life!"
1,This book is Not for parents who want to bottle feed.,"You'd be better off asking your doctor for a formula company brochure if you want current information about bottle feeding your baby. This book has nothing to offer a new parent. What a sad book this is for a new mother to read. Not one bit of useful information, nor anything new or insightful. A very strange book by an angry author who rants about women who are able to breastfeed their babies."
1,One word... Therapy!,I suggest the author seek therapy to get over her anger at breastfeeding mommies. That would certainly be more helpful than publishing a book. I guess misery loves company.
5,A Classic!,"Ever since reading Halliburton's book when I was a little boy, I wanted to visit all the wonderous places he described. This month I finally made it to the last one on the list -- The Great Wall. Thank you, Richard, for showing us how high to set our sights!"
5,bring it back into print,"The other reviewers have said everything that needs to be said. Halliburton's story-telling skills to kids are as good as anyone who has ever lived, I suppose. If whoever owns the rights wants to bring this book back, good for them. If they don't, that's their business - too bad for the rest of us."
5,A 1940's boy's trip around the world!,"I originally had this book ina two volume set, and later a single volume. I treasured the book, and at age 55 I have it with me, plus an additional copy I found as an adult. The pictures were taken between the world wars and preserve a wonderful historical moment. This book was educational in the most wonderful of ways."
5,Book of Marvels,"When I was 13, I was given this book. It stirred a desire to travel and see the things written about therein. Today, in my 50's, I just visited the Panama Canal written about in Chapter 13. My plan is to see all if not most marvels before I die. This book should be manadatory reading for all teen-aged children to give them a unadulterated perspective of the world and to entice them to travel. Truly a life changer and highly recommended reading."
4,Unexpected,"I've never been a fan of Kelis' and when I bought this album I wasn't expecting much- boy was I surprised. This album really grows on you and the Neptunes production creates instantly catchy tunesMy favorite tracks are Perfect Day, Popular Thug, Mr UFO Man, Flashback + Little Suzie, but Perfect Day plus Popluar Thug are the best. One thing which lets the album down is the similar production although I like the Neptunes Kelis should try other producers."
4,Loved it better than the first!,"Kelis out did herself with this album that wasn't released state side. If you like good beats, this is a great album for you... The Neptunes at it's best.****************************************A great album, playable all the way through with no skips, only repeats."
3,3.5 stars,"Many people say this is Kelis' best album. It is experimental, I'll give it that, but I feel that it's just average. It has nice production from the Neptunes, and some of the material is very good, but then there are still some songs that just do not work out. I would still recommend buying it if you're a fan of Kelis."
4,This is one of the most overlooked cd's of 2001!,It is a shame Virgin wouldn't release this over in the U.S! The music industry doesn't care about artistic or creative anymore it just all about the money! If this album was promoted and pushed I am sure it would have succeeded. How in the world are you going to have the NEPTUNES produce the World and don't release a project that they put there heart and soul in? This is a soley Neptune's production and a Damn good one at that! This cd definitley sounds like something Prince would have done if he was motivated. This is a interesting creative project and definitley worth purchasing. The Beats will definitley grab you if nothing else will!Arish
5,Im going to Wanderland,"This album is off the chain!!! I have fell in love with Kelis since her first hit Caught Out There. Her style remains original with the help of her Star Trek Entertainment specialist The Neptunes. I just can imagin all the theatrics to each of the songs that she has put out on this album. Young, Fresh and New, Popular Thug, Digital World are some of my favorite songs on the album, Daddy anf Junkie are simply hallarious with a touch of Divaness that only Kelis could produce. All I have to Say is Check out this album cause it is fresh..."
4,Kelis and The Neptunes do it AGAIN!,"This is the follow up to Kelis' debut. It won't be available in the U.S. until February, but the first single, Young, Fresh N New, is in regular rotation on MTV Europe and the Disc is available in Europe as well. I liked Kelis's first CD, Kaleidoscope, a lot and this one goes further in same direction. From the hilarious Intro to the TWO bonus tracks this is a great disc. Stand out tracks are Young, Fresh, n, New, Scared Money, Shooting Stars, Perfect Day (co written and performed by No Doubt)and Easy Come,Easy Go. The Neptunes' production is a little more agressive and experimental here than with the standard stuff they are doing with everyone else on pop/R&B radio. This is a great CD."
5,I Really Think This Album Is Worth Buying...,"I really love this album ""Wanderland"" she has hot beats produced by the Neptunes & hot tracks. She is a really great singer & I Think This Album Is Her Best Work So Far. My Favorites Tracks Are: Shooting Star, Get Even, Perfect Day feat. No Doubt,Little Suzie,Daddy,Young,Fresh,N New,Digital World, Scared Money, & Mr. UFO Man. When I was looking at the track names I thought Mr.UFO Man would be stupid but its a really great song. I wonder why didn't her album come out in the U.S yet, thats weird. For The people that wanna buy this album & wondering how is it, well by describing this album its very ""Fantasy"" & i think thats cool. So Everybody cop This album its great."
3,Greatest Hits?,"How can their greatest hits collection NOT include ""Americas"" and ""Heat of the Sun""? Purchase ""Live"" instead for their greatest hits."
3,Medio del Camino - Middle of the Road,"I agree with the overall assessment that this ""Best Of"" collection falls short of that description, and omits some classic pieces (like ""Selva"", from 'Americas') in favour of lesser tracks. 'Live' (1997) showcases the best of that period. My suggestions for S&F newbies at this stage would be 'Fantaseo' (2006) and 'Stringweave' (2001). You might also want to check out the Jorge Strunz 'solo' outing, 'Neotropical Nocturnes' (2010), which briefly features Farah, along with several alumni from the earlier records. With just one accompanist per track for the most part, it offers a neat comparison with the group material. Better still, catch 'em in concert!"
5,Mountain Dreams made me laugh!,"In FIVE STEPS TO FLIRTING and SUNDAY SCHOOL AND THE SECRET AGENT, Gail Kennedy creates loveable heroines caught in dangerous situations coupled with the kind of heroes women dream about. Wonderful supporting characters and humorous treatment entertain the reader from page 1 to the end."
5,Moving music by a true spirit of worship,This is a moving CD with beautiful lyrics and sentiment! Danny has a voice that soothes and tempers the harshness of life. He has compassion and conviction in his voice and there is no greater message than worshiping Jesus! It is one to be listened to over and over!
5,Love this picture,"I have a much bigger print of the Dali Rose Meditative, but I recently remodeled my bedroom and the bigger one didn't fit. I ordered this smaller one and it works perfectly. I don't know why,but I've always loved this picture. I don't especially like any of Salvador Dali's other work, but this one just grabs me."
2,Weak structure,"Although I very much like the LOOK of the ring, unfortunately in less than a week, the ring began to lose its shape because of the gap between the heads. Definitely not a ring that can be warn constantly and one that is easily lost or broken. Boo."
4,nice dictionary,Nice dictionary but if you are looking to learn english or spanish I recommend the Electronic dictionary Franklin.
2,Smells liek plastic.,The smell of the plastic bottle this comes in is stronger than the base scent. It smelled much better in the old days when it came in a glass bottle.
4,Works ok,Handy for a quick read but seems to read cooler than a thermometer on liquids. It does read surface temps accurately.
4,MT4 mini - handy tool,I use the MT4 to check air temp at the air vents on my heater. If it goes below 100 degrees - something is wrong. Also use it to check for cold air leaks around doors and windows to determine if caulking is necessary. Great tool.
3,"Great tool, but should have been better calibrated","This is a wonderful tool for lots of purposes, but the one I bought from Amazon was significantly misaligned. At a distance of 8 feet from the target, the spot illuminated by the laser is off to the right of the temperature sensor by nearly a foot (the vertical alignment, on the other hand, is fine).For many purposes (e.g. pointing it right at a frying pan from a foot away), this sort of misalignment will not matter. But it's an annoyance, and one that could have been easily prevented by factory testing (or by providing adjusting screws for the user).Other than this, it's great (and fun to use)!"
5,Wonderful tool for temp measurements,"This is a great tool to assist us, we are a management office and at times we get complaints of no heat, this device proves to us and the tenant that the heat is within the legal requirements"
2,Not accurate,Between the readings taken with a K type thermocouple and this non contact thermometer there is a wide variation much more than the tolerances set out in the manual.I was measuring the case temperature of a Power IC.Also the Laser spot is wide off the focus.Not very useful for accurate measurements
3,Not the standard stuff,"A couple of nifty aspects to this film sets it above the standard teens-get-slaughtered horror fare: the abundance of female nudity (and bikini-wear) and the special effects. And in fact, the film opts more for surrealism than gore, which is a nice change. The story has a bunch of young people gathering at a house for an end-of-summer bash. One by one they fall victim to bizarre hallucinations, then actual violence. Is the house haunted or is the weird goth hostess messing with their (admittedly puny) minds using her super goth-powers in revenge for their juvenile cruelty? I'm not telling, but the answer's a solid double, if not a home-run. Along the way, some very seriously scary and creepy stuff happens. Favorite line: ""Sex is everything."" Second favorite line: ""This party's getting a little out of hand."" Third favorite line: ""Dude, there's some crazy s--- going on in here."
3,Pretty Scary Effort !,"This film is kind of scary !You might try to write it off as a direct to dvd release with no budget,But WAIT .So its a wild party at `the girl who nobody likes' house.There is alot of pretty people doing bad things and the haunted house may take exception to their subversive ways.Effects seem to be all computer originated,But very welcome sights."
5,The Softies: Flawless Beauty...,"I had never heard the Softies before but I already owned Go Sailor, which Rose Melberg is part of. That instantly made the album appealing and on a whim I chose ""It's Love"" as my first Softies purchase. I was not disappointed. Every song is absolutely beautiful. Rose Melberg and Jen Sbragia's voices are euphoric, whether alone or together. The music is simple; at most two guitars, whispy and twirled around the sweetest melodies. Although the entire album is perfect, personal favorites are: ""An Aweful Mess"", ""Charms Around Your Wrist"", ""Hello Rain"", ""I Love You More"", ""Alaska"", ""This House"" (an instrumental), ""Perfect Afternoon"", and ""Until You Tell"".It's Love..."
4,This book changed my life,"When I was 20 years old I was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumetoid Arthritis. A rare form of arthritis (1 in 60,000) that begins in childhood. In a matter of 2 months I saw 5 different doctors, and went from a perfectly healthy college student to someone who could hardly stand up long enough to brush my teeth. I tried everything medication wise and found no true results. Then my mom found this book. I read it and bought the cookbook too. I found that changing my diet worked. Dr. Dong explains how our diets and lifestyles affect us and how to adjust them for better health. It's especially good because Dr. Dong has experienced exactly what he writes about and you can tell."
1,"Lindsay, please get a clue","I wish Lindsay would please get a clue. She can't sing. She just got a contract because she's an actress. She should stick to acting. Even though I don't really like her movies such as Mean Girls, she at least can act pretty well. And she's not a good role model for pre-teens and teens...just look at her dancing! Lindsay Lohan obviously wants to be noticed, and if she's not careful she will become known the same way Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson are known. They are all three not role models that should be looked up to. Don't waste your money on this CD."
4,Satisfying enough,"Lindsay Lohan's debut Speak --at first listen-- doesn't seem to have much to say, but after a few more unbiased earfuls this piece of teen pop/rock is pretty satisfying. ""First"" shouldn't have been first, but following tracks ""Nobody 'Til You,"" ""Symptoms of You,"" ""Over,"" ""Very Last Moment In Time"" and first single ""Rumors"" are all darn good tune-age. Overall, a decent release from a girl that still has a lot to say."
1,Paris Hilton rubbed off on you...,"And that is not good. What made you think you could be a singer also? You will be gone from the public eye in 5 years. Unless you think that being Tara Reid is ""in the public eye"", [...]I remember seeing you lip sync on Good Morning America. Then you lied and said you were not faking it, you were really singing. For that to be true, you need to move your mouth when your voice is being amplified. Where is the world tour - oh yeah, you don't have one, because you can't perform live. [...]"
1,Give me a break!,"Okay...after looking through others reviews, it's pretty obvious how this album got such high ratings....the same person keeps writing reviews over and over in hopes that someone will be as impressed as they are. (ie: ""OMI GOD, she ROCKS!) These are the people who are targeted by the recording world to push their talentless clients.As for my opinion, I'll keep it to the point. I've only heard two songs and do not want to hear a third...From the cheesy cover of the CD to the whiney voice,proves that singing is not one of Lindsay's talents. What will she try next? My guess is a ""clothing line"" and shortly after that a ""Lindsay Lohan fragrance."" Jack of all trades, but unfortunetly, not good at any of them."
2,oh man,"i have not had the pleasure of listening to the entire album, but i have set through the samples of the songs. the one thing that i remember is how it sounds as though she has gum in her mouth while she sings"
5,Hey! Don't be so Mean!,"Come On! Don't be so mean. Lindsay Lohan has a great voice, she's a great singer and her songs are very cools. So... why R U so means? Whay do U have against her? R U going to tell me Britney is a better singer that Lindsay...??? Yeah, right...! Lindsay rules! So, stop being so mean to her and start seing another singers who R VERY, VERY much worsts!"
3,Buy It At A Discount,"If your planing on paying average retail ($13.99)for only 5 good songs, find a better way to waste your money. Lindsay Lohan proves to be a hit with the chart chasing ""Rumors"" and ""Over"" but those two are only truly studio quality. Coming close to good singles are ""speak"" and ""To know your name"" but everything else is cloned, over popy, cheap beats. I'd expected more from Lindsay Lohan but I guess I should of expected less, She isent Hilary Duff or Jessica Simpson. Shes alot less."
1,"A nice try, but not a success.","I'm not going to bore you with a point-by-point analysis of the CD. But its safe to say it sucks. Of the 11 songs on the CD, 2 are good (I really liked ""First"", and kinda like ""Rumors"") and the others are crappy. My advise to Lindsay, stick to acting."
1,omg,"it's bad enough we have crapy actors turn singers, but then you do it and really don't make it any better. I can at least admit that you can act alittle. i liked mean girls. but that doesn't men you can sing. in fact you really suck. your just another hillary duff lip syncing ashlee simpon crapy combo. it's bad enough you could barely act but then you try to sing. stop making the world a worse place thyen it is. GOSH!!!!"
3,Could Be Worse,"I mean this cd isn't the wrost I've heard but it's not great either. Lindsay is a very talented actress and should have stuck to that for a few more years before making an album just to make an album like every one does these days. The songs I liked on the album were SPEAK-4/5 Very catchy and sounds a little 80'sNOBODY TILL YOU - 4/5 Very Ashlee/Avril but goodOVER-4/5 not bad, but when she tries to hit high notes its sounds like she is screaming rather then singing.RUMORS+TO KNOW YOUR NAME sound like they came off the lastest Britney Spears Album if you ask me. Very poppy. I mean Overall I got to hear it on the Internet and I'm not rushing to buy it."
3,It's a guilty pleasure,"I really wanted Speak to be like the Freaky Friday soundtrack, which had some rockers that really stood out from the pop/rock pack. But Speak is more like a combo of Avril, Britney, and Michelle Branch with as a previous reviewer said, some 80s sounds. At least the mix makes for powerful dynamics on the album that get you dancing and rocking at the same time. Lyrically, some songs seemed pieced together, but the lyrics are assertive in a different, celeb way which some might find vain but others like me will find revealing. This album won't change the world, but give it a chance."
3,Speak-very disapointing,"I've waited soooo long for Lindsey to get her cd out, and its this bad? What in the world? I love this girl to death and I think she has a great voice, but this cd does everything in its power to make it sound more electric then raw. The pop songs basically suck and as much as I hate to say this it really sounds like shes trying to be Hilary Duff. So somebody needs to beat her up because Hilary is the worse singer in the world, I wouldn't even call her a singer. Anyway, back to Lin...There are two songs on the album ""Speak"" that are good...""Rumors"" of course...thats an awesome song..and ""To know your name"". Those are the only two songs worth listening to...so I do not recommend spending your money on this album. Chances are that will be her next release if she has another. So just record it off the radio and you'll be set. Very dissapointing....very.. :("
2,"Sound like Hilary, but OK","When heard track 'First' I though it was Hilary but when i listen carefully, i know that it was not Hilary. Only one or two tracks in this album were good and the other tracks make me feel sick and I think it was a good try from Lindsay and if she put track 'Dont move on' for full version in this album, it will make this album not too bored to listen because I like that song very much. Overall I give 2 stars for Lindsay.1. First 4/52. Nobody 'Til You 2/53. Symptoms of You 2/54. Speak 3/55. Over 2/56. Something I Never Had 2/57. Anything But Me 3/58. Disconnected 3/59. To Know Your Name 2/510. Very Last Moment in Time 2/511. Rumors 2/5"
4,speak from lindsay lohan,lindsay lohan's first album of speak was off da hook. that has songs that is sweet. and is a must have for fans of her.
1,TIRED OF RUMOURS?,"Tired of Rumours? What Are You talkin' about?, you're not barely famous!, you don't matter that much!...what if knew comers are begginning to state the back off I'm star thing since the start, this is the end of music...maybe fake Britney could relate to that song, even ugly Paris Hilton...but you, no,no Lindsay Lohan needs someone to bring her back to earth, surely you are not all that....and for the rest of the record, well we all know now were Ashlee Simpson filler cuts end up."
1,"Lindsay Lohan is HOT, but...",She can't sing. At All. What kind of album is this? I want my money back.
1,NOT FOR KIDS UNDER 10 YEARS OLD!!!!!!!,"I just gave this CD to my 6 year old daughter for Hanukkah and was appaled to see the cover, the back and the inside pictures. First off, if this is supposed to be a role model for children then why pose like it's Playboy magazine. She is 18 years old and has fans as young as 6, why show them pictures like this and then have the audacity to have a picture in the jacket of you flipping the bird to the camera? Is that very appropriate for a 6 year old to see. I wound up giving my daughter the CD without the jacket so she wouldn't have to see such things. In the future she may want to re-evaluate how she wants to appear to the ""YOUNGER"" crowd of fans!!!!!!! The next CD will not be purchased by me if those are the pictures I will have to indure. I may as well get her a subscription to Playboy. Think before you pose, Lindsay!"
4,Lindsay Lohan........singer?,"Lindsay has a good voice,but all the songs base is kinda the same.(exept for ''Rumors'' and ''Symptoms of You'')I thought that the video to ''Rumors'' proved she was becoming more like Britney Spears,which isn't a good thing.I do think it is wierd people do not think she has a good voice.She is perfectly capable,though it could of been better.Star quality doesn't mean jumping into every part of industry possible,but her taking singing on is okay.She is good at it,too!We love ya Lindsay!!:)"
4,Not the best voice but catchy songs,"This took me quite a bit of listens to like ANY of the songs. But, I am glad that I gave it the 2nd, 3rd and even the 4th chance.Not an amazing voice or groundbreaking songs by any means....but good ol' pop/rock that seems to be something I have grown to like more & more lately.Before I bought this CD I had heard the song ""Rumors"" which I really liked. Has that pop sound with a good beat to it. So, I bought it the day it came out. I was mad at first. But, like I said, I listened to it more & more and now I really like it. I thought the songs were going to have more of a ""Rumors"" type sound. They don't. They are catchy though.The songs I like the most are: ""Rumors"", ""To Know Your Name"", ""Speak"" and the slower ""Symptoms Of You""."
1,"Wow, some of you actually enjoyed this crap?","I have to admit that I like the song ""Rumors"" so I went ahead and legally downloaded this album using my Napster account. And after withstanding sixty seconds each of six songs, I promptly deleted it. The songs are poorly written. Lindsay clearly can't sing. It's cleaverly hidden thanks to all the added production noise in ""Rumors"" but the rest of the album painfully articulates that fact. And while she's pretty as always on the video for ""Rumors,"" she also painfully demonstrates that she cannot dance. So what is her reason to exist as a pop singer? You tell me. All I know is that the ""delete"" key on my computer is a beautiful, beautiful thing."
1,More Corporate Garbage Aimed at Those Who Don't Know Better,"Wow, just what we need, another so-called ""triple threat"" singing unintelligent, overproduced, overrated garbage about things she probably had no part in writing about. Lovely. And to make it worse, having it marketed toward those who need to understand that true creativity in this day and age are really intrinsic to self growth and self realization - our kids. This drivel sang by a celebrity already making more than her share of money as it is, is selling out to major corporations and in turn, desensitizing everyone who has to listen to yet another scantily clad moron who can't sing. (Oh please. Led Zep would eat this corporate schlock for breakfast.)"
3,Catchy? Yes! Original? No..,"So I must admit, I like this album. Lindsay Lohan's first album ""speak"" is one of those catchy song albums with forgetable tracks. She has an ok voice, but thats it everything is just ok... It's just an album that targets people who know who Lindsay Lohan is, It's rocky.. poppy and not at all wow material. Songs like disconnected and very last moment in time, sounds generic. Its just beats while Lindsay just speaks throughout a song. Kinda like Hilary Duff, But just because you have catchy songs (Over,Rumors) Does not at all mean your a good singer or a singer at all. But now in this point in time everyone seems to be able to sing and get a record out and sell Hundreds. I still like this album even though its not at all great, just something to drown the noise out around me. I give this album 3 stars, Songs like Rumors,symptons Of you and Over are worth a listen."
2,Harmless pop tunes,"I'm trying to expand upon my album reviews, the criteria only being that I've listened through an album at least once or know it somewhat well. I'm not ashamed to say, I know this album well. Lindsay Lohan's first is a very harmless pop outing - girly and joyful with equal measure of ballads and ""fun"" tunes. Chances are it won't win anyone over, and the bland mix won't rise above the sea of poppy hits in any big way, but if you're not ""above"" some easily digested all-female pop-rock stuff, you might even find a few of the songs catchy. I especially fell for Lindsay's raspy club-sound, but unfortunately there's not much of that around on this album, so don't expect her rising to the ranks of say, Rihanna or Lady Gaga (yet?)."
3,So-So (2 and a half stars),"This album is not great, but it's not as bad as some people have said it is. 'Symptoms of you' is the only song I really liked. It had a sweet melodic touch to it. 'Over' is also a fairly good song.The other songs aren't great, but have good, fast beats. If that's what you appreciate most in an album, go ahead and buy this. Remember, you won't find anything of great emotional depth here."
1,you've got to be kidding.....,"I am so sick and tired of actresses thinking they can sing. Just because you've been in a movie or two doesn't mean you have to run to the nearest recording studio and release a crap cd. First JLO, then Hilary Duff, now this garbage? These songs are nothing special and neither is this cd.As for the song ""Rumors"", Lindsay needs to quit complaining. There are worst things happening in this world than what magazines are saying about her. Most people have lives to live and really dont give a crap who she's dating or what she's doing anyway. Get over yourself Lindsay, go live your life and have your fun and do all the other stuff you said in your stupid song but just do the world a favor: stick to acting and please no more cds!"
1,"""SHUT UP""...","That should be the title of this CD because Lindsay's debut is horrific. Her song ""Rumours"" is a Britney Spears knock-off and her voice is terrible on it. Did any of you happen to see Lindsay on her first LIVE performance on GMA? Yeah...that was LIVE!!! She didn;t even lip-synch right. WTF?!!? Hilary Duff is 100 times better than Lohan. But if you're looking for a good Cd this holiday, look at Kelly Clarkson's ""Breakaway."" A woman who sings live and is just a great vocalist and performer over all."
1,"Simply, Absolutely, Unquestionably Dreadful","Make it STOP!!! Please tell me that it's ""Over."" This poor girl is tone deaf. She wouldn't make it past Simon on American Idol on her best day. So if anyone has done anything good, it's the producers who managed to make her sound even remotely on key. Now we know why she's always begging off live performances, claiming she's not feeling well. Even when she does perform, she keeps saying she has laryngitis. Sorry Lindsay -- you just have a BAD VOICE!! Bottom line: If you want to listen to overproduced, shallow, meaningless, forgettable pop that isn't even sung well, this is the album for you. Because being a cutesy poo actress under 20 does not qualify you to become a singer -- it doesn't even qualify you to become a pop star. Good grief, but Mandy Moore and Jennifer Lopez are starting to look like huge talents compared to this pop-tart du jour. Blech."
1,LL Rocks?,"Instead of going off on a tangent about how the music industry has changed over the past thirty years I'm going to get straight to the point.This album is terrible.Lindsay Lohan has no musical talent at all.This album is a mix of ""teen rock"" and pop music on an album with no direction at all. The lyrics are boring and the content seems to be up to the writing standard of a 12 year old. The album's lead single ""Rumors"" is just Lindsay Lohan complaining for three and half minutes about how she can't go anywhere without the media watching.Her voice isn't anything extraordinary either. In fact, it's terrible. She has no vocal range at all and the only reason she stays relatively in tune is because of ""studio magic"".I'm not one to usually complain about the quality of an album but I had a really hard time trying to listen to this one all the way through without falling asleep.Do yourself a favor. Do not waste your money on this."
1,Waste of Disc Space,"I have to admit, pop music can be decent sometimes...Britney Spears' first album was annoying, but it wasn't THAT bad, an Jessica Simpson actually has a pretty good voice. But after hearing this CD on my younger sister's friend's CD player, I may have changed my mind. Just about every song sounds the same, and the lyrics aren't well thought out at all...Lindsay Lohan should have stuck with acting, first of all, because that's what she's good at. She's too young to be singing Christina Aguliera-esque songs, yet she does anyway.I'm not going to waste my time and energy by typing a review of the songs on the CD. All I can say is this album is musical trash. Don't buy it for yourself, don't buy it for your kids. People are always saying that we need to conserve our resources, so why not save a few trees and stop manufacturing this CD?"
1,Why?,"Lohan is a very impressive, upcoming actress who shows considerable promise on the big screen.On the other hand, Lohan has such a sub par voice it makes me question the validity and common sense of the record company's decision to invest in her singing abilities. It's crazy to watch industry newcomers believe that actors/singers can easily make the transition from one stage to another if success is found in the first arena. 99% of the time, it fails, and Lohan is another classic example of this. Her CD is terrible, and subsequent videos are really bizarre (who is this fake blond?)Here's to vain wishing that Lohan will realize her error and never produce another album again."
1,Is this supposed to be singing?,"I don't mean to be mean, but Lindsey Lohan cannot sing. I used to be a fan of her movies, but she's gone sour with bad movies such as mean girls and too seductive dance moves. The only reason she got a recording contract is because she's an actress. My cat could probably meow ""Jingle Bells"" better than she can sing. If you'd like to listen to a good CD, try Jump5, Hilary Duff, Diana Degarmo, Carrie Underwood, or Third Day."
4,"Lindsay has spoken, I'm glad I can listen.","I had no idea that Lindsay had talent in the musical field until I saw her on Freaky Friday. I was impressed, so I decided to give her debut CD a whirl. I'm surprised at the reviews here. I find the CD to be listenable. Not only does Lindsay make a mark as an actress, she also makes a mark here. I knew the comparisons to Hilary Duff and others would be inevitable. Rumors is not the only good track on here, I also love and recommend To Know Your Name and Something I Never Had. I'm glad that I listened to this CD because I would have been missing out on some great material. I would also like to say that I'm in my mid 20's and I happen to enjoy this, so this doesn't appeal to just the younger generations. If you enjoy pop music, I would definitely suggest this. To me, there's no reason why Lindsay shouldn't be a singer, I see promise in her work."
1,WHERE IS SHE,"THE ALBUM IS HORRIBLE AND IS HER ONLY HIT.SINCE ""RUMORS"" & ""OVER"" COMPLETELY FLOPPED.WHERE IS SHE...O I KNO...FLOPPING ON EVERY CHART IMAGINABLE.SHE IS UNTALENTED.ONLY PEOPLE UP 12 KNOW WHO SHE IS!"
1,What A Disappointment,"I was so excited to hear this cd in its entirety...only to find out that really the first single ""rumors"" is the only song I could handle sitting through. Th rest are just bad songs, dumb lyrics and they're not catchy at all. I'm still a Lohan fan... but this CD was a bad purchase."
1,WOW....,"...is all I can say. First off, Mean Girls was funny and Lindsey Lohan can act. SHE CANNOT SING to save her life. F*** this album. It f***ing sucks. And why she making fun of Hilary Duff??? She has equal talent in singing (though Lohan can act better...) and Hilary's a lot prettier in my opinion. As annoying as Hilary is, at least she's a good role model for all these frickin teeny boppers...(gotta keep em under control)Yeah. This review sounds really biased but in reality, this album just really blows.1/5"
3,"Excellent Songs, Vocals Need Work","Lindsay Lohans new cd could have been so much better had it not been sung by Lindsay Lohan. All of the songs are good, but Lindsays voice is not, and the producers go out of their way to cover that up, so thankfully her voice comes across as somewhat decent. As long as you don't expect Lindsay to sing like Christina or Kelly, then you will enjoy this album. From the fiery club hit ""Rumors"" to the midtempo catchy second single ""Over"" there are plenty of hits to pick from. Other highlights include the guitar driven first track ""First"", the funky 80's style ""Magnet"", and the pop/rock ballad ""Symptons of You."" Only Lindsay Lohan fans will love this cd, but if you're not that big of a fan, then I'de skip it."
4,"not bad, not great","I'm really tired of the current ""pop-rock"" trend of female artists. I mean, is there really any difference between Ashlee, Avril, Hillary? But, I really liked Lindsay's single ""Rumors"" (the scorcher Britney wished she released instead of the been-there yawn of ""My Perogative"")and was hoping for more in the same vain from her CD. Sadly, her producers took her down the Hillary/Ashlee/Avril route with a lot of bland ""rock"" songs. While not particularly bad, none truly stand out.Having said that, the touchingly sad ""Something I Never Had"", the rousing ""Speak"" and the Britney-esque club track ""To Know Your Name"" do stand out better than anything on the last Hillary album. I am just sad to hear ""Over"", another paint-by-numbers pop-rock song, will be the next single. The CD overall is plainly OK, but, the few good songs are worth the purchase."
5,Very excited about this one,"Hi all. Although I haven't opened up this CD yet (because it's for my 12 year old for Christmas), I am so excited about it. I've watched Lindsay Lohan grow up on TV and I am so glad she has put out a CD. It's hard to find CDs for 12 year old girls that have content suitable for them nowadays. I've listened to the clips of Lindsay's ""Speak"" CD and can't wait for my daughter to open it so we can both listen to it. Judging by the clips it sound like this will be a quality CD to listen to and there won't be any need for skipping tracks. Way to go Lindsay! Keep up the good work and can't wait for you sophomore CD!"
1,Lindsay is THE biggest fake!,"Lindsay has NO vocal talent at all. Plus, there isn't a single catchy song on this disk. Lindsay thinks that she's a rocker, but really, she's a bubblegum pop princess. How can she think she's punk when she just starred in ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen!!"" Plastered all over the CD are skulls and everything is black. I mean COME ON PEOPLE!!! Can a CD cover design make you goth?? Basically. . .don't waste your money on this junk. Go buy some real music: Fall Out Boy, All American Rejects. . .and if you like pop, get a Kelly Clarkson CD! At least she can sing!!"
1,Pure Crap,"Amazon, how in the world can you even begin to compare this crap with led zeppelin. John Bonham is probably rolling in his grave after the mention of that. Lindsay Lohan is just like Hilary Duff. They are both sucky actors and.....guess what? They are both sucky singers! They should go on a Suck Fest tour togeather and let people get in for free so we could all throw rotten vegetables at them."
1,More Marketable Drivel to Your Kids,"Please, People. Have respect for yourself and your kids and reject this crud. She's clearly not a musician or singer as it were; pop drivel is all. Teach your kid some math instead. Actually spend some time with your tween, instead of letting the infectious vibes of corporate world take over. Can you?"
1,"Great ""EFFORT...""","Who designed that CD cover? Joan Jett? Looks like one of those cheesy images on the front of a Trapper-Keeper.Anyway...Man, what is with these dingbat kids who attempt not to impart the SLIGHTEST amount of creativity while ""composing"" their ""works?""OK OK... This is IT. Kids under the age of 19 should have governmental provisions on ""their"" ""music:""1) Must not imply or blatantly state that they know poop about life.2) Must hire at least a semi-qualified graphical artist to develop their CD covers and inlays.3) Must not even imply the false pretense that they can play a musical instrument.4) Must not receive record deal if on the cover of the National Enquirer more than 48 times.Man, this buffoon deserves no further attention. I'm out."
1,amazon.com has issues!!!!,"mentioning this pop tart in the same sentence as led zep?!?!?!?!?just who in the h3ll buys this garbage?!?!?!?and do they need to hold their parents hands when crossing the street?!?!?!?!?it is truly insane to think of the the flatulence record labels will call ''artists''.............this is a s bad as it gets!!!!!!oh,wait,ashleY simpleson is coming out with a second helping of mule dung!!!!!!the end is near"
1,pure evil.,"another idiot taking a bite out of the coporate pie.the vocals are lame, the music is lame...but come on, what did we except?"
1,rumours...,"Well it seems that lindsay and her producer made one good song- rumours, then just came up with about ten more for fun. She looks good and thats important. Don't buy this cd...i doubt her fans will even like it. If your that desprate for the song rumours then just buy the single..i wish someone told me that!"
1,Ewwww,"Once again, another singer that is based on MTV. I hate this CD and Lindsay Lohan. Just because you're an actor you can't have a record deal! Okay, that's not true, but it's true that your record is going to suck, which is what happened here. John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi wrote all of the songs, Ashlee Simpson did more effort in writing than Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay did co-write four songs, but that's barely any effort whatsoever. Lindsay doesn't sing either, it's all enchanced. She's copying Hilary Duff, who isn't much better anyway...actually they're the same, they're both awful people who think they're musicians, but theyr'e actually a disgrace to musicians. Do NOT buy this album, or anything sponsored with MTV, becuase 9 times out of 10, it's gonna suck."
5,Surprisingly good,"I never used to like Lindsay Lohan. I always thought that she was a good actress, but the girl behind the acting was just a troublemaker who likes to get into a lot of dramatic fights with other celebrities. But, that was until I heard her album. She has a surprisingly good voice, and anyone who likes pop music should try listening to this. I really enjoyed listening to the album.. I can't believe that she can sing that well! This album turned me into a Lindsay Lohan fan, and hopefully, she'll come out with another one. I want to see what she'll do next.."
4,I'm Tired Of Rumors !,"I thought that I will surprise but the truth not this so good one as me thought, has few songs that are hit, among those this the one That is the first Rumors it sails which has an excellent mixture of rhythms, of rest lindsay makes all the possible one to seem a small ROCKERA, but the truth is pure mixture of this I generate with POP, I like the truth but it is not so good, other good songs of the Album are Speak which gives I title to the album it is very good, To Know Your Name, Disconnected, which have influence rockera, Nobody 'Til You and Over are other good of rest it is pure garbage, for that reason I qualify this CD with 4 stars.I'm tired of rumors startingI'm sick of being followedI'm tired of people lyingSaying what they want about meWhy can't they back up off meWhy can't they let me liveI'm gonna do it my wayTake this for just what it is"
1,Kids Get A Life,"lindsay's 1 fan keeps making up names about the same pointless story that they hated her and no love the 1-hit-wonder white girl kiddie star that don't do jack with her music1 LO-FLOP FAN, WE'RE NOT DUMB! SHE IS OVER LIKE HER FLOPPED ""OVER"" SINGLE! DUMB 1-HIT-WONDER!"
5,SPEAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I DIDNT REALLY LIKE LINDSAY LOHAN. I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST A KID PERFROMER. BUT WHEN I SAW HER MUSIC VIDEO I WAS LIKE DAMN!!!!!!!!! SHE IS HOTTT!WELL I BOUGHT HER ALBUM. ITS GOOD ITS ROCK MIXED WITH A LITTLE R&B AND TECHNO. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE: NOBODY TILL YOU, SPEAK, TO KNOW YOUR NAME, DISCONNECTED, RUMORS, ANYTHING BUT ME. KEEP DOIN YOUR THING!"
1,please lohan...back off the music industry,"Regretfully, i have listened to the album and i am very disappointed in the songs it consisted. Lindsay lohan barely keeps herself in tuned, making the songs not pleasant to listen. LIndsay Lohan has no special or nice voice, no outstanding talent in songwriting (unlike delta) and it is revealed in the album. PLease, don't buy the album, it is a waste of money - like you are listening to some girl having a satisfactory shot at karaoke. There are countless for albums available by extremely talented singers, talented singers, or not-so-talented artists. I am not a fan of lindsay lohan, actually, im not a fan of anybody. i have noticed some earlier reviews made by lindsay lohan fans and some where truthful, most were eager to praise this album like the best ever."
1,Ugh!!! Please stop the teenybopper horror!!! (from a TEEN!),"I am a bonafide teenager, and am embaressed that my generation apparently likes to listen to any of the crap that the radio and MTV throw at us. I had to listen to this album because one of my friends likes it...the best I can say is that it is generic and blah. Yes, my parents had ""teenyboppers"" too, but people still listen to the Beatles...will people listen to this 50 years from now? Lindsey obviously is not doing this for the money- she just wants to inflate her ego, and obviously her record company just wants to cash in, irregardless that they are helping suck the creativity out of music. To other teens out there: explore on your own- do not give into what MTV tells us is cool. If we don't listen, they can't play it."
2,"""Rumors"" Starting 'Cause Lohan Can't Sing","Wow.. that dosen't even sound like her voice! Lohan's voice is not very impressive. The background music for most songs have a pretty okay beat. ""Rumors"" especially. I wouldn't suggest buying it though unless you just want it for dance music.. I hope my review was helpful."
3,Lohan Speaks Out,"I kind of expected the cd to be a little bit more rock when I read about it in magazines, but when I bought it, it turned out to be kind of duller than I had thought. I liked Rumors, but that seems to be the only song I like that doesn't go slow. I must say it is better than wannabe Hilary Duff's many miserable failings at attemptions to sing."
2,"This ""Rumor"" Is True","I recommend this horrible album to you if you want to hear somebody completly talentless sing compleley disgusting songs. All I am saying is, if you are a great actress, this does not mean you are a great star."
3,Don't take it too seriously,"When I picked up this album, I bought it for two reasons: 1)I was curious to see how it sounded and 2)it was on sale for $7.99, so no big loss. But I was surprised. It's not too bad. You can tell her voice is enhanced, but overall the songs are good poppy/wannabe rock efforts that shouldn't be taken too seriously. I don't expect a sophomore album any time soon."
2,CANT SING!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think lindsay lohan should stick with acting for now i mean her single RUMERS was good, but when i listened to the rest of the album i was annoyed by the 3rd song. i thought it would atlest be better but i isn't very good i dont recamend this c.d!"
2,A glitzy overproduced poor CD with too many filler songs,"Teen superstar Lindsay Lohan wants to follow in the footsteps of Hillary Duff, only take it one step further and become the new Britney. Sadly, Lindsay's attempt was unsucessful. This album is full of glitzy robotic techno-like dance songs that take no true tallent to record. However, i have to admit Lindsay does have a decent set of pipes on a few songs. Rumors, her single, has to be the weakest track on the CD. After listening to all of SPEAK one is really left with the feeling of a pop-star wannabe taking songs from all aritists and adding a synthesizer. 2 out of 5."
4,very good cd,speak was a very good cd from lindsay lohan. and i wish that there was more songs on this cd.
2,Perfect for fans of Avril or Ashlee (snicker),"Where to start? From the embarrassing teenbeat cover art through the all-to-impersonal songs, this is one mega-selling effort that is the the perfect triumph of commerce over craft. There's nothing in Lohan's delivery that suggest she is anything more than an amateur singer, and she's certainly not a songwriter of note. Why the album then? Marketing 101. She's there to deliver other people's songs. Unfortunately, she doesn't do it well on the by-the-numbers effort. Fans of Avril and Ashlee will like this, but that says it all, doesn't it?"
3,"""speak""",I thought Lindsay's cd was ok. some songs are really good but there are also a couple that are boring! mostly what bugs me is that she is trying to be like everyone else. Also I think people should stop comparing her to Hilary and Ashlee because they have different music than Lindsay Lohan....better music actually! sorry to say but her cd is just ok and i would only recommend it if you like Britney Spears and other slutty people that have to show off everything just to sell records because people like that aren't real musicians they are just sell outs!
3,Not too bad,"When I heard Lindsay Lohan was coming out with a cd, I was like okay here comes another Hilary Duff. Well, I got a free listen of the entire cd and shockingly it's not like ""Rumors"" at all. It's alright, not my favorite cd in the world. She is better at singing then Hilary Duff but again that's not saying much. She falls into the Britney Spears thing another teen pop star who cannot sing either. But I probably would tell my friends they should buy this album. Just because it's frankly not worth buying. I'm glad I didn't spead 15 dollars to buy this cd. And just heard the whole thing for free."
1,TALENTED AND UNTALENTED,"ACTING: SUPER TALENTED. MAKIN ALL THE $MUSICALLY: A MUSICAL FLOP ON EVERY CHART! SHE NEVER HAD A HIT, EXCEPT THE QUICK ALBUM ""SPEAK,"" WHICH PEAKED & DEBUTED #4 AND THEN HAPPENED TO BE THE BIGGEST SINKER! LOOKS LIKE 1 WEEK OF THAT SO CALLED ""GARBAGE"" WAS ENOUGH!"
1,The Album: A Hit; The Rest: All flops!,"this album was her only hit...so she IS a 1-hit-wonder! the single ""Rumors"" got good airplay, but flopped on the charts. ""Over"" was a TOTAL FLOP! the album did quickly disapear off the charts, and lindsay is so over! she is a disney girl trying to be bad, yet, she said in an interview on yahoo something like ""I need to watch what I do, because I have a sister that looks up to me""...ya real bad...NOT! she is also disney and so untalented! she barely co-wrote 4 tracks and the talent stops their. her voice is horrible and she is another ""Queen Of Flop(s)"" stupid 1-hit-wonder wannabe..lindsay your music career is so over...you might as well shoot your untalented self like other 1-hit-wonders jojo and jessica simpson!"
4,Speak,i'm only giving it four stars because some of the songs are a little bit rockish thats not what I want from lindsay. symptoms of you dissconected and to know your name are my favorites
1,She speaks too much,A terrific thing for children at 2 or 3. If you're 4 y.o you should be disappointed.
1,Are you people kidding me?,"First of all, Lindsay Lohan was sort of pretty at first... then she became anerexic... she cannot sing and she's ugly... why why why do people like her.. I have no clue.."
4,Not her best...,"I was somewhat disoppointed in her CD. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was good, but it is lacking something...There are some good songs on there such as Nobody 'Til You, Symptoms of You, and Over. And then some songs were, um, crap. I was hopeing for more rock/pop than R&B. What can I say, I bought the CD. Oh well..."
2,only 2 songs i like,she cant sing but some songs are good but only 2 songs are good rumorsand over and that is all lindsay lohan stop trying to be better than hilary duff because you are not even close
3,"Lindsay is ""OK""","This album is ok. It's not great though. My favorite songs are the title track ""Speak"" and ""Over""."
5,Astounding Debut Album,"Male, gay, 32 and I absolutely love Lindsay!!My neice was watching the 'Confessions of . . .' while I was using my mothers PC and I was back and forth from the TV to the PC and eventually sat down with her and watched it until the end! I downloaded a few songs and from there bought the album.All the tracks are 100% fab, but I love Rumours, Magnet, To Know Your Name and Speak.I hope she will release another album and it's just as impressive."
1,shut it!,"My only recommendation to any future buyer is to listen to this cd before deciding to purchase it. Borders and Barnes and Noble allow customers to listen to almost any cd in their system. Anyway, I only heard this cd once and it really wasn't catchy or nothing seemed to have stood out for me. I thought I would like it almost as much as Ashlee Simpson's cd but unfortunately I hated it. Hear before you buy so that you won't be disappointed or you may very well enjoy it. But that's how I felt."
1,excellent skeet shooting material dude!,"Yeah I love going out to the shootin' range with my crate full of Kongo Waste cds, Fiddy cent, nelly, hillary duff, pretty ricky cds, and this one of course and launchin' em into the sky and BLAM! shootin' em. Always a blast baby."
1,Fuel for her slide down,"Last summer, against the wishes of my spouse, I went to see ""Mean Girls"" and found myself enjoying the movie and thinking that Lohan (as opposed to the abhorent Duff sisters) had talent and comic chops. What a difference a year can make because during that time, Lohan decided releasing this vanity project would somehow turn her into L Lo.Her awful public singing and the putrid music videos that have been released are testament to the fact she's not an entertainment multitasker. She should try picking better projects and leave the singing to artists who can concentrate on writing and performing music.Not one song on this CD stands out. Not one is worth mentioning. They are just all mass production of mass vanity, better left unbought."
2,"Oh, Lindsay...","Lindsay Lohan is one of today's brightest up-and-comers, which is reflected through her debut album SPEAK. She is not originally a recording artists, as most of the world knows due to the fact that she began through movies (The Parent Trap to Mean Girls), so she is definitely not banking in solely on her voice, which CAN carry a melody just fine, though she fails to truly pull it off as her own. Half of the lyrics speak a sortof complainy ""I'm a celebrity, leave me alone"" tone, with Rumors most clearly spelling it out. Lindsay's other songs dictate the normal teenage gooshy love spirits as most albums from 18-year-olds do. For now, until Lindsay discovers her own voice, America must understand that she is just banking in on her celebrity.I have confidence in her to do better next time. Take your time, find your voice, and let other people write your own music if you suck."
1,You have got to be kidding me...,"Umm... okay, I wasn't planning on writing a review for this, but the very instant I actually stopped to look at Amazon's review and saw them comparing this to LED ZEPPELIN, I had to say something.Can you say BLASPHEMY?? Sure. I knew that you could.Let's do a little contrasting here, shall we folks?LED ZEPPELIN: One of the rock juggernauts of the 1970's. Legends in the field of rock in general. Classic rock staples. Incredibly talented musicians. Timeless albums. LEGENDS, PERIOD.LINDSAY LOHAN: Once very cute, now kinda cute, disposable, forgettable teen star.Now, if I may ask, where did the Led Zeppelin comparisons come from? Man, Zep will be remembered in 100 years, Lindsay Lohan's music career is already being laughed off.If you agree with me, click ""helpful"". Otherwise, click ""not helpful"". (Gee, I wonder which one will win...)"
4,"Lindsay Speaks up, and makes a noise","With so many teen pop singers out there, it's difficult not to label each as a knock off of the other. Now that Lindsay Lohan is thrown into the mix, one wonders what she might sound like an imitation of, however, this ""Mean Girl"" proves that her sound is all her own. ""Speak"" may not be anything revolutionary, definitely not a classic by any means, but no one can deny it as a fairly creative, pop, party album. Songs like ""Nobody Til' You"", ""Magnet"" and ""Rumors"" rock the house. ""Symptoms Of You"", ""Very Last Moment in Time"" and ""Over"" show some more depth. However Lindsay truly shines with originality on the mid-tempo 80's sound of ""To Know Your Name"". If you what you want is an easy listening pop album, skip over Hilary, get Lindsay Lohan's ""Speak"""
2,"GARBAGE, LINDSAY, GET JAZZY AND NEPTUNES ON NEXT CD PLEASE!","(...)PLEASE PEOPLE SAVE YOUR MONEY! HERE ARE SOME REASONS WHY:1. THE ALBUM IS 35 MINS LONG!2. IT'S NOT A POP ALBUM LIKE ACCEPTED!3. SYMPTOMS OF LOVE, OVER, DISCONNECTED, AND RUMORS ARE HER BEST TRACKS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS TRASH!!!4. WACK PRODUCERS AND WRITERS! JAZZY PHA AND NEPTUNES NEEDS TO HELP HER OUT!5. TOMMY MOTALA EX.PRODUCED IT, FIGURES, WHERE HAS HE BEEN LATELY, OH STALKING MARIAH CAREY STILL!6. NO FEATURE ARTISTS SINGERS SANG WITH HER ON THIS ALBUM!"
3,Lindsay Lohan - Speak,"After seeing Mean Girls and Freaky Friday, I thought Lindsay Lohan would be able to pull off a cd. Much to my dispair, I was sadly mistaken. Each song happens to sound like each other, which at first, was not such a big problem. But then came the bad music. The beat just does not match with the words. I give 3 stars to Lindsay, for trying. Some songs are good, such as Speak and Over, but Rumors is still the best one."
3,it's not so bad,"At first I was really skeptical as to what Lindsay Lohan's debut album would be like. I was expecting a pure pop album that contains songs like her first single ""Rumors"". I was kinda surprised that some, or most of the songs are pop rock. Overall I would say the album is pretty much ok, but she can't really sing. And she does sound like Hilary Duff in some songs. I would have to say that if she was not known as an actress, her album would not be known and she would not even last in the music industry.She should just stick to acting instead of singing. She can't really sing, but the songs on the album are pretty much okay."
2,"Couldn't listen to all of it, even if I wanted to........","I love music, all types, from Frank Sinatra to Nirvana, to Mandy Moore. So I was willing to give this cd a chance, but after listening to Rumors I just couldn't understand why the fuss?Lindsay Lohan is a great actress, but should stick with the acting, sorry but the girl just doesn't have a voice. Sort of like Britney can't act but can sing...hey we all have our gifts!I'm sure teeney boppers will love it, but not me.....I'll put on an Ella Fitzgerald cd on any day.Stick with Mean Girls....and not Mean Singing...."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Lindsay Lohan is the ""Pop Tart Du Jour"". She's very cute, very sexy but she CANNOT SING!Save your money - - pass on this turkey."
4,Rockin' good! Amazingly boring! This CD haz everything!,"This CD is pretty much the same as all the other pop out there, not very unique, the kind of CD U get tired of in less than a week. Not that I M against that. because a lot of the music i like, well, let's just say most people would say the same thing i'm saying about Lidsay about the cds i like (ashlee simpson).So here is my opinion on each song:""First"": boring and unoriginal.""Nobody till you"": Gr8 song! I really enjoyed it! :-)""Speak"": another unoriginaley gr8 song (i luv it)!""Over"": This iz 1 that i don't like.""Something I Never Had"": Stunningly dull.""Anything but me"": 2 some people this song is ""1 more of the rest of 'em"", but for some strange reason, i really luv this 1.""Disconnected"": another good 1, in all it's unoriginal glory! Imagine that!!!""To know your name"": Complete nonsense! makes no sense at all!!""very last moment in time"": Extremly sleepy...""Rumors"": it seems that every singer releases a song like this :-)Hope this helped!"
1,"Here's a ""rumor"" that's true : LINDSAY LOHAN CAN'T SING!!!","Celebrities (to use the term loosely) who crossover from singing to acting and vice versa will never learn. But, in the entertainment industry nowadays, image has taken over talent perminately. Why must LL go from such movies like Freaky Friday, and Mean girls to ""making an album""? She sound like Ashlee Simpson on crack. Lindsay, news flash: JUST BECAUSE YOU ACT, DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN SING!! That's how RUMORS get started (to cone a phrase). How long must we suffer the likes of this? It's as if somebody (stoned) told LL (Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, Britney Spears etc.,)that she can sing and act. I wonder..................when will Christina Aguilera make her big screen debut?"
1,You have to be kidding me...,"As if pop tarts like Ashlee Simpson and Hilary Duff weren't enough, now we have Lindsay Lohan? Her vocal skills are mediocre at best, and her originality is severely lacking. Music is an art, and she is NOT an artist. Don't waste your time, it's really not worth it."
1,Awful! :(,"Lindsay is a horrible singer! The only song on here that I like is First. Her song Ultimate, from Freaky Friday was ok too. I HATE rumors. It's like she's yelling instead of singing. Also, one of the pictures in the song book is really innapropriate. There's only 1 thing worse than this cd: Kidz bop singing Lindsay songs!"
5,Excellent Album!,"1. First 5/5 Good song to Open the Album, very cheerful2. Nobody 'Til You 5/5 are a very Sticky song3. Symptoms of You 3/5 Anything special4. Speak 5/5 Their rhythm dances me agrees to kylie Minogue it should be the 3rd Single5. Over 5/5 to Be the 2rd not sail this so bad one,has a very sticky choir6. Something I Never Had 3/5 Anything special7. Anything But Me 2/5 are a dirt but that we can make!8. Disconnected 4/5 are too sticky, it is good but not excellent9. To Know Your Yam 5/5 excellent song, I like their rhythm slow type it Dances10. Very Last Moment in Time 3/5 Without comments11. Rumors [*] 5/5 are one of the best songs that have listened in the lifeI wait The they promote Like Deserves for all Latin America."
1,what they wrote n reply!,"A PAST REWIEW: -shes not talented and a 1-hit-wonder...not even for a song, but for the album. all her singles flopped, but the radio played made the album a hit. lohan, your over...stick to acting...CAUSE YOUR NOT MUSICALLY TALENTED AT ALL....! your as over as your flopped single ""over""! d**k bag LOHAN!MY REPLY: -DAMN STRAIT! The album was her only music hit and ""Rumors"" was very minor...not even a hit! ""Over"" was a totaly flop! She isn't even musically talented...dumb ""wannabe popular"" stupid white (...)."
1,lohan is over!,"shes not talented and a 1-hit-wonder...not even for a song, but for the album. all her singles flopped, but the radio played made the album a hit. lohan, your over...stick to acting...CAUSE YOUR NOT MUSICALLY TALENTED AT ALL....! your as over as your flopped single ""over""! d**k bag LOHAN!"
2,I just don't get it...,"I'm not a fan of people who are Actors turn singers... They're usually not that great. In this case I was right. I got the cd just because i'm a fan of Lindsay's acting and I thought I would give it a shot. The song ""Rumors"" is a catchy song but theres nothing great about her voice. I think Lindsay needs to stick to acting."
5,Lindsay Lohan Rocks!,"To tell you the truth, when I first listened to this album i only liked half of it but after you listen to the whole album twice you will love it. its an album that grows on you, i love it. Lindsay lohan is hot and sexy, and i like her voice because its not great. i hate singers like celine dion they just make me sick i like calm voices. BRITNEY SPEARS ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,stay away from music,it's a good thing she's getting away from movies and music and wants to go to school. Hopefully hilary and ashlee will get it through their thick heads that they have no musical talent AT ALL and follow in lindsay's footsteps
2,Seen it 1000 times,"This CD isn't horrible, but there's nothing unique about it. Lindsay is nothing but a typical crossover singer who sings generic pop. In one song, she says ""everything they want you to be, is anything but me."" Wake up Lindsay, you are EXACTLY what producers want you to be. She is stick thin with implants and in this world, that's all it takes to sell an album."
1,And this is what happens when music goes wrong...,"Oh dear. Not only does Lindsay Lohan's irritating voice make me want to shoot my foot, these songs are kinda bad. Well,crap to be honest. Most of the lyrics don't make sense and is it just me or do all these songs kinda sound the same? Yeah, probably, because they've all come from the same manufactured sound studio where you don't have to actually have a strong or even pleasant voice to churn out any crap you please.Now back to Lohan's voice. It's not only not powerful, listening to it for a while I realised it is actually annoying. And I mean real annoying. She shouts through choruses and her voice is so nasal she makes Britney Spears sound good. Now that's saying something.In conclusion: Her songs are worse than her fake tan."
1,umm nope..,"I am the type of person that can listen to anything even very bad pop. Lindsay Lohan's speak is a total disqrace to pop music. She rips off almost every pop singer big in the business as of right now. for exampleNobody Till you-Hilary DuffSpeak-MadonnaSymptoms Of you-Ashlee SimpsonOver-Ashlee SimpsonFirst-Ashlee SimpsonTo know your name-Britney SpearsDisconnected-Hilary DuffNeed I say more? Its bad enough your a actress turned singer, but at least put some more originality into your songs. The best song is the hit Rumors which is a amazing track and is sort of J.Lo-Esque But Still. If you need another Pop Artist Go pick up Hilary Duff's Self Titled Album or Ashlees Autobiography instead of this drivel so called pop album."
2,Highly Overrated Everyday Pop/Rock Wannabe,"The fact that Lindsay cannot sing is one of the reasons why this album is not up to scratch. Her vocals are terrible, and her songs are cheezy, and Hilary Duff-ish. Is it the new craze for actors to become singers? I think it is. The cover is less than perfect, it is ugly!"
5,Whoa! I can't wait for her sophomore album...,"I am absolutely in love with this album. At first I didn't actually fancy 'Rumors' but then after a while it grew on me and I loved it. The rest of the album is flawless. Sure, she's no Christina or Mariah, no big shock. Still this album is incrediblely fun, and every song is just perfect. The lyrics aren't as cliche and the beats are fantastic. It's hard to pick a favourite track also, because every single one is just perfect in its own special way. Ms. Lohan totally blew me away with this cd, and it is most definitely not what I expected. One of my favourite album EVER. Good job Linsday!"
2,"Lindsay should ""speak"" and not sing","Okay Lindsay. You are a wonderful, talented actress...I think you're one of the most talented teen actresses out there. But please, stick to acting. Sorry Lindsay, you don't have a good voice...and quit trying to be the next Avril Lavigne. The only track worth listening to is ""Rumors""."
3,"Oh, come on, Lindz!","I bought this CD and flipped through the songs quickly. I have to say, I expected a lot more from Lindsay. She has a husky voice which is different from a lot of other teenage singers these days, and I think it's great that she writes her own songs.But personally, I didn't enjoy these songs too much. She is not that good a vocalist and I can hear her struggle a bit. The tunes failed to interest me.The only prominent song on this album is 'Rumors' but to me it's really childish, like she's throwing a temper tantrum.This CD is ok, but it could be a lot better."
4,Its Pretty Good,"I've been a fan of Lindsay for a long time, shes been in voice lessons since she was 6, she can write lyrics, and can play the guitar, so I was fully supportive of her music career. I expected nothing less than great from her. Well, this CD isn't great, but its pretty good. Speak is a fun little song, Over is a good break-up song, the Avril-ish Disconnected has pretty good lyrics, and the Britney-ish To Know Your Name is a good dance song with a hot beat.1. First (3/5)2. Nobody 'Til You (3/5)3. Symptoms of You (3/5)4. Speak (4/5)5. Over (4/5)6. Something I Never Had (3/5)7. Anything But Me (3/5)8. Disconnected (4/5)9. To Know Your Name (4/5)10. Very Last Moment In Time (4/5)11. Rumors (4/5)"
4,An CD with catchy beats,"The album wasn't everything that I expected, but I love it. The beats and chorus' are very catchy and will have you hooked the first time you listen to them. Highly recommend it, and just remember... 4 more to come."
2,Same old song and dance,"Nothing about this CD is original.... immediately when I heard it I thought of Avril and Ashlee. I think her only good song on this CD is Rumors and we all know what that sounds like. Her first album is a shame. Right off she put her one and only good song on the radio and left nothing else to be surprised about. this is cd is not worth buying, just listen to the radio and you got the best song right there, probably playing for you once every hour!!! Save your money!"
3,More Grit than her peers,"Ok. I'm not a teen queen fan. I think the exploitation of female artists is on the rise again. The Brittney's, Christina's and Hillary's have all sold out to the mass male media performing bubble gum tunes in their next to nonexistant outfits. All of these youngs girls have untapped talent. Unfortunately, it's untapped.That being said, it's showbiz. I think that Lindsey has the potential to be more. She's got some grit (proven in this album if you can look past the supposed teen angst songs that were most likely written by a 40 year old male songwriter). She delivers with real emotion and some grit.With some help from her Mom, she just might be able to break that teen queen mold and move on to bigger things like Alanis.Here's to hoping!"
1,kill yourself before listening to lindsay lohan.,"she makes me so angry.a)cosmetic surgery and makeup do not fill a musician/songwriter's empty spaces that their lack of talent leaves empty.b)when i said cosmetic surgery and makeup as a measure of a musician/songwriter's talent, i did not mean to imply thatlindsay lohan was a musician/songwriter.c)cocaine does not make you better at singingsomeone elses bad music, lindsay lohan."
1,Horrible,"She... nevermind. I'm just gonna leave it at that, it's too easy and she's already forgotten..."
1,linday lohan copyed hilary duff,"because how come linday dyed her hair blonde? you can see that she's trying to be like hilary duff she's acting like her,she's talking and singing like her,she's doing her hair like her. i'm sorry but I like hilary duff better. thank you. it's just like kelly copyed avril."
2,Slut...................,She has become such a skank that no one even notices it. She sings ok. Soon she'll be posing nude in a [...] ad or somthing. I gave this 2 stars because she's pretty hot!
1,Cheesy Pop,"Well I dont have the CD but I wouldnt buy it EVER.I know it sucks though,because my younger 6th grade friend has the CD and I have to endure it whenever I go over(which isnt often,lucky for me).She's only in 6th grade so she hasn't gotten to the age where you start to know the difference between good music and cheesy music.At this point she likes singers like Hilary Duff,and Lindsay Lohan.And I went through that phase too but now,thankfully,I'm over it.Her voice is unoriginal and sounds fake.[...].Her lyrics are cheesy,her video is cheesy,and her voice is cheesy!She's fine as an actress but as a singer she sucks.Dont buy the CD and if you do you know youre at the stage where you dont know good music."
3,"A Decent Debut, but It's Got Issues...","Lindsay Lohan, everyone's favorite sex kitten since Britney Spears went domestic, turns in a mostly pleasing mix of rock/pop and club beats, courtesy mostly of ubiquitous hitmaker John Shanks. ""Speak"" is a decent debut, but it's got issues, namely that Shanks wrote better material for fellow teen queens Ashlee Simpson and Hilary Duff, both of whom released far better albums earlier this year. Lohan's voice is clear and strong, but aside from the smoldering hit single ""Rumors"", there's nothing on the album that ever quite measures up to anything we haven't already heard. While certainly listenable, ""Speak"" sadly has nothing new to say."
1,Disconnected!!!,clearly...lindsay is not bad...but she is not as good as hilary duff..(though people think hilary is bad..which makes lindsay worst)....her songs are nice...CERTAIN songs are catchy..but she totally can't connect to me..its like a brick wall right in between..i can't feel her songs!!...next..she is clearly trying to like do what other people does although she is not that capable...she is like not so high of a quality...so i suggest she stick to acting!!
5,Great!,"For all of these songs on her debut album, I have to say I love at least 8 of them. They all have a catchy tone and nice dance mix. Lindsay has come a long way to this time and now her album is out and everyone is loving it!!! Also, www.i-squad.com has all information about her and daily updates about TRL and other scheduled appearances. SPEAK is definitly the best CD out this December!!!!"
1,"Hey, let's be famous for a day!","Alright, alright, enough, let's just all come to a conclusion here:We should light this album on fire."
1,Dead God...help us all....,"This is probably the worst song and album of the year! And I thought Brittney Spears couldnt sing...I take it back...she's Aretha Franklin compared to Lindsay Lohan who is only singing (trying to anyway) because her rival Hilary Duff sings already. She insults Hilary and yet acts just like her...they should be best friends because their musicial talent is beyond horrible. What am I saying??? What musical talent??? This girl who IS NOT pretty, she still has 20 BILLION freckles all over her upper body, and she IS NOT sexy as she thinks she is parading around in her video like a cheap tramp in heat...NOT GOOD PEOPLE!! DONT BUY THIS TRASH FOR YOU OR YOUR KIDS!"
1,Are you serious?,"I admit...I am a fan of Lindsay's movies, so i thought that i'd listen to her album. Wow. She has no right to make fun of Hilary Duff. She is soo much worse! She hardly sounds like shes singing! They need to stop offering record deals to people just because of their name. If Lindsay can have an album out...any one can."
2,blech,"this cd's so annoying and gay. u'd think she'd be a bit ""original"". all these songs sound like hilary duff songs...even her voice sounds like hilary duff. did they just get hilary to record this and put lindsay on the cover or something?? cuz i seriously can't tell the difference. this cd sucks sooo much. even hilary duff can do better. dont waste ur money on this crap, lindsay lohan's an alright actress, but making her turn into a singer is going one step too far...if u want a GOOD chick singer check out:Avril LavigneKelly ClarksonHilary DuffEvanescenceKaty Rose...hell even BRITNEY SPEARS is better than this"
1,not her gift,"by listening to this album, I can thell that singing was not her gift, she should stick to what she good at (acting) and let the singers sing"
5,Five stars? How about five MILLION!,"Lindsay is a true survivor: abuse, bulimia, drug use, and whatnot. He ability to persevere inspires me. I love this woman, and this is a great album. Get two copies."
2,ok cd but i hate her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well Lindsay did have some good songs in this album. She can sing too. It's not all that great either. Like""rumors"". Omg lindsay if you don't like people being all up in your business and all that crap WHY did you become a singer/actress for? Lindsay is a bad example for girls!! Plus she looks pathetic in the songbook pictures. Oh yea and she also looks pathetic in her blonde hair. Her movie's suck too. Hilary duff is way better then Lindsay. I hope lindsay dies"
1,NOOOO,"okay i love others like her: mandy, hilary, and some ashlee.. but they must of had to edit this cd to cover her terrible voice SO MANY TIMES!!! on AOL sessions, her singing is worse than like.. mine which is really bad.. and all her music videos show her cage dancing and making out on her bed and implying further things.. the kind of thing you should definatly keep away from"
1,who is she,who is she? what does she sing? how is she famous? does anyone know who this girl is besides all the dumb little kiddies who don't know talnet? . . . I DONT THINK SO! LOHAN IS HORRIBLE AND HER MUSIC CAREER ENDED LAST YEAR!
3,These actors really got to stop thinking they are singers.,"She is very attractive and she is a pretty good actress but she can't hold a tune at all without computer technology.Definately not worth spending money on, i recommend buying something from Led Zeppelin or Johnny Cash.But my opinion don't matter..."
1,I totally agree with Forest law,"You have to be like the smartest person ever! I LOVE THE WAY YOU THINK! I've read all of your other reviews and I have the exact same feelings as you.Maybe if you are still single we could talk or something, you sound hot!"
1,Meat hook sodomy is less painful than this garbage,"I'll keep this short, being that the title of my review pretty much says it all. I could go on a long rant on how watered down, mainstream and awful this is but that's a given, so I won't even go there. Don't buy this. I think i'll stick with my Black Metal, Death Metal, Thrash Metal, Heavy Metal and underground rap albums."
4,Pretty good....,"I have come to have a new found respect for Miss Lohan. She is a decent actress...and she can sing. However, she needs to stop trying to put out material that is so similar to Hilary Duff. I was hoping that this album was going to be more R and B influenced, like RUMORS, but instead we get another set of hard rockers and sappy ballads. Overall, the album is good....but I have to say that I was surely looking forward to hearing RUMORS at the end. Other highlights are SPEAK and IT'S OVER."
3,Good CD,"This debut album of Lindsay Lohan Is fair for a first cd. I Love lindsay as an actress I think she's great and she's also a good singer. Anyways this album has so many good songs to chill out and relax or some just to have some fun.Best tracks: ""Nobody 'Til You"",""Over"",""Speak"",""First"",""Rumors"" And ""Magnet""."
5,Lohan is out to prove herself as a singer and succeeds,"Lindsay Lohan's ""Speak"" has a number of tracks, varying from rock/pop to techno dance beats to pure hip-hop. She hits her notes well, unlike fellow teen star Ashlee Simpson, and has profound lyrics unlike whiny elemntary schoolgirl on helium Hilary Duff. Every track has had time and thought poured in, and all the melodies are very catchy. Strongly recommended."
1,Nice Ass; Horrible Music,Actors should really stay away from the music scene. Great music shouldn't need a hot chick to sell the CD. Stick to the music and stick Lohan in a modeling agency where she belongs.
2,As much as I hate pop music...,"A couple of the tracks found their way onto my road trip mix cd. Namely ""Nobody 'Til You"" and ""Speak."" The former sounds like Kelly Clarkson meets Avril and the latter sounds like 80's pop.The rest sounds too generic, overproduced and indistinguishable from the rest of the pop princesses of the decade."
3,a boring debut.,"even though many say Lohan's second effort is better than her debut ""Speak, others have found it hard to forgive her. This album was a poor way to begin a musical career and recieved bad critical reviews. It has more than it's fair share of filler material. (To Know Your Name, Disconnected, etc.)It shows little depth and is seems to be just another way for Lohan to gain success among teens. On a happier note, the songs ""Rumors"", ""Over"", ""Speak"", and ""Nobody Til You"" manage to somewhat 'save' the album. So in the end, it's not a complete calamity, but you won't be raving about it for very long."
1,stick to her movies instead,"just rent parent trap, freaky friday and confessions and that's all you ever need from lindsay lohan. Music is NOT her thing! Good thing this chick is going back to school I can only hope other wannabe singers her age can do the same for themselves instead of slaughtering the name of music"
3,"LL, ISN'T TOO COOL ON THIS ALBUM","Uh, i love you LL, but babygirl, why would you come out with ""Rumors"" that was a total club banger then come out with this soft rock stuff. The only person allowed to do that is Mariah. I did like ""disconnected"", ""rumors"", and ""over"". But, I know you all may laugh, but I can see LL being more of an Pop/R&B act I don't know why. But that's just one of my fan fantasies I'm having for myself."
2,Why? I was really anticipating this....,"I was really anticipating this cd. After hearing ""rumors"" (which has a dance/R&B; sound)I couldnt wait to hear the rest of the album. UNFORTUNETLY, I found myself listening to a bunch of catchy ""rock"" tunes that show NO vocal talents AT ALL.This is what happens when record companies want to market a beautiful girl who have so many other talents BESIDES singing....a bad album.So I suggest to anyone who is on thier way to buy this album after hearing ""rumors"", to give this album a preview before so. Not at all the same type of material.But I must say that I think Lindsay is a beautiful, smart, and talented (in acting) girl. And I wish her success in the future."
3,coffehouse classics,"The disc is OK, BUT I did not recieve the one I ordered and inside the case/cover was a disc that ALSO did not match the cover as well as my request, so there are three degrees of separation from my wish and my received order so how could I possibly enjoy this and the price on the cover is MUCH lower than my payment.To return it would be a hassle and an expense and I may still NOT recieve what I ordered!!!"
4,The Mule Shines Live with Stellar Supporting Cast,obviously the boys were stoked performing New Year's Eve with very sympathetic guest stars such as the estimable Derek Trucks; rocking selection of cover tunes and Gov't Mule originals make this a live must for true rockers
5,I think the CD is great I miss you IRENE,To IRENE CARA I think you CD is wonderful but matter of fact I love all your music from fame to what a feelin and anyone can see to carasmatic D.C. cab certain fury busted up and the longshot and sparkle. So get yourself ready IRENE because I am your biggest fan and come back to the scence.

4,YEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeHAaaaaaaAA!!!!!,"A wild ride through an incredible sport. Whether you're a fan of bull-riding or not, this video offers insight into a world most sane people will never see.But the best things about Chasing the Dream are the people profiled in the film. You get to see just exactly what in the world makes someone put themselves on top of several tons of dirt-stompin', snot-snortin' angry beef. A strange and brilliant little film - definitely one for the collection."
1,the emperor's are naked,"Merce Cunningham, and particulary John Cage, have nothing to say. This work is an exercize in nihilism; it means nothing. Cage wants his ""music"" to be uninfluenced by him. Why write then? The ""music"" is a series of words minus vowels, manipulated by computer to be void of any suggestion of real words or sounds, let alone any musicality.The music and choreography, per Cage in the interviews included, were written with no knowledge of the other. This is not hard to believe.I bought the tape to use in a Survey of the Humanities course. I will probably use it, or part of it, but as an example of bad modern art. These old men in this film are fraudulent. Pitiful.There are two positives. One, it shows the difficulties of filming dance. Movement seen on a stage vs on a screen are point-of-view difficult. Two, the film accurately reflects parts of the contemporary art world: Devoid of meaning and happy to thrash around in excrement."
2,its actually 3.5,"3.5, but i gave it 2 because the other guy gave it 5, so its to balance out.too much big sugar influencetoo funkybut stil good"
5,Very impressive sounding budget speakers!!,"I have these connected to an Onkyo TX-SR606. I use 14 Gauge speaker wire with banana plugs from monoprice. These speakers have a very solid sound, and yes they can sound like there is an earth quake in your basement. The tweeters produce a clear and crisp sound, like said before the bass can rock your house! The speakers are built very solid, i do have to admit that the red color with the grill off is ugly...but who cares lol"
3,The subwoofer speaker is 6 ohms..,"This speaker sounds nice, but i noticed their are the same speakers on here but theyre better? I want to return these and get the better ones, and the sub is 6ohms, which sucks. It would cost too much to ship them back though?,"
4,Good for entry level / budget stereo applications,"These speakers are decent. They do not hit the low notes (roughly less than 50hz) which is a let down, considering Cerwin Vega's 12"" models can easily accomplish this. But, the notes the 15"" woofers can hit are hit hard. The self resetting feature for the woofer is nice so you don't have to worry much about damaging them accidentally. If you are looking for speakers that provide deep bass, keep looking. I would recommend purchasing a sub woofer to compensate for the lack of ""not hitting the low low notes."""
1,75% say this is a bomb,"Just reading the reviews for the album ""Finally"" by Blackstreet has made me decide not to buy this product. I know that people should not make their decision based on others, but I have really no choice because 75% of the review were negative. I have listen to Blackstreet in the past and I thought that they had it going on. ""I guess not"". Blackstreet You probably just had a bad year. Good luck in your next album."
1,HELLO BLACKSTREET GOODBYE BLACKSTREET,THIS BOYFRIEND GIRLFRIEND S@?T IS GARBAGE IT'S LIKE BARBIE AND KEN I MEAN COME ON NOW CAN WE SAY CORNBALL.
4,ALMOST as good as Another Level,"Blackstreet came with maybe a few too many dance tracks on ""Finally,"" though the overall product is good. A few of the songs that were originally listed don't actually appear on the US version of the album. ""Can You Feel Me"" starts off the album with a Blackstreet hip-hop mix, where Teddy and Chauncey rap the whole song through. ""I Got What You On"" is sort of like a ""No Diggity Part 2"" jam, that will eventually grow on you. ""I'm Sorry"" features the new member of Blackstreet, and is an incredible ballad. ""In A Rush"" is by far the standout track on this joint, and blows out every R&B effort of 1999. This song was well done, and gives you tingles every time you hear it."
1,The worst Teddy Riley Production ever.,"I remember a day the day way back, when Teddy Riley used to produce and write the phattest jams and ballads around. He really could do no wrong, that is until now ....Teddy give us what we want GUY - The dopest group around. You really have failed miserably with this set."
2,What Happened?,I was all pumped up to get this CD. I thought it was going to be good and I didn't even listen to it because I figured it would be. I wish I left that garbage in the store. The only good song on the CD isn't even a song. It's an interlude after track #3. I wish they would do more slow jams. I'm shocked and disappointed. Nothing will compare to the first album unless they get it together. Oh yeah: Boyfriend/girlfriend is the dumbest song I've ever heard in my life.
4,GREAT dance music!,"I am not a big hip hop fan but I love this new cd by Blackstreet. I especially love the song they did with Janet,""Girlfriend/Boyfriend"". I also love the gospel song they did on there ""Finally"", its great to hear gospel mixed in with dance music these days. The really only complaint I have about it is the price I paid for the cassettte version of this at Walmart $12.99 for a tape!! HIGH!! I remember when tapes were $8.99 or even $9.99. Cds are what should cost $12.99! Other than the price, its a GREAT tape."
1,"Teddy, you're DONE!!!","NO, NO, NO, NO!!! This should have been kept in the vaults!! Teddy, you need to end this Blackstreet concept because EVERYONE WANTS TO HEAR GUY!!! There is no originality here, and I wouldn't recommend this CD to one of my enemies (or maybe I would!!)."
3,There last one was better.,Whatever happen to the slow jams Blackstreet made famous. This CD lost that element and isnt as good as another level. Too many fast songs and boyfriend/girlfriend is not a tight song.
3,Well....,"Well when I got this I was all hyped up.. However, the first time I listened to it, there was only like one song that I kinda like. This kinda disappointed me cause I really liked the majority of Another Level, however, after listening to it a bit more, it's a shame that they don't have a sample of ""Think About You"", cause I think that it is one of the best tracks on the CD. ""Can You Feel It"" is alright with it's Jackson 5 vibe to is, other than that... well the ""Girlfriend/Boyfriend"" is OK, but other that that, it will take a bit to get used to... Oh well...."
1,"Ok, who is this group and what did they do with BlackStreet?","WHAT HAPPENED? BlackStreet has been one of the rare male groups that I like, that I thought could really *sang*. Their second album was an instant classic (I still listen to it) but this one is instant trash. I like ""Think About You"" but they sound like Jagged Edge or some other thrown together group. And what the hell is ""Black & White""?! Trash, garbage. What happened to the beautiful, soulful harmonies of the days of old? This is a cd full of disapointment that guest stars could not save. I am with the person who said they were going to sell the cd to a used store. I only hope it gets me more money than that sorry 100% Ginuwine cd. Save your money for 112's Room 112."
2,Teddy please retire before you F up another great group,I just heard that Blackstreet was breaking up . Why dont you go back to the days of the silent producer and bring back the rest of the blackstreet members . Maybe yall could do some Temptations type stuff .
5,Finally went Gold!!,"I remember this album when I was in the 6th-7th grade. I love this CD. This album is a definitive statement,the end of the 20th century. This record sets the template for what R&B must sound like as they entered in 2000. This album is about R&B that is willing to work without a net. It is confident and schooled enught to give the peeps what they want and deserved, like everything Teddy has touched in his years making music. It is that bag of chips and the possibilities and the promise of R&B, delivered by four of its soulful practitioners. This album has been certified Gold. Remember,this was 1999."
4,the bomb cd,"this cd is th bomd..i know a lot of wrok went into this cd..i love the way it all comes together...the lyric, the beats and the voices...i would deffintely recommend this cd to anyone..one you listen to this cd you are hook..because it is really off the hook...no lie and no jokes....really"
3,DISAPPOINTING,"TEDDY, ERIC, CHAUNCY, TERRELL YALL BROTHAS HAVE MUCH TALENT DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPEN WITH THIS ALBUM BUT AFTER ANOTHER LEVEL WHICH WAS TRULY THE BOMB.. YOU COME BACK WITH SOMETHING LACKLUSTER IS THIS .. OUTSIDE OF GIRLFRIEND/BOYFRIEND, DRAMA, AND THE TITLE CUT FINALLY WHICH IS TRULY INSPIRATIONAL... THERE ISNT MUCH MORE ON HERE .. IT'S BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND PUT OUT SOMETHING THAT YOUR FANS KNOW YALL ARE CAPABLE OF PUTTIN OUT .."
3,aiiight,"this album sounds more like an album from all for one or color me badd...straight pop/r&b, no streetfeel what so ever...keep it real teddy & chancey, y'all mo funky than that...by the way who's that group 8th ave? Now they sound good, I hope they get the hott tracks, cause you sho left them off this blackstreet album...and who's bright idea was it to put the phattest song on the album, enhanced??? real bright..who's gonna hear it?"
1,Aargh..is that Blackstreet?,"It is soo depressing. The new Blackstreet album is worse than anything released by a boygroup. First, the cover looks like a boygroup, second, the song mostly suck. I'm glad I've gut the single only. Hope they do better next time."
2,An Extremely Disappointing CD From One Of R&B's Best,"Being a huge Blackstreet fan, I was really disappointed after listening to this CD. The first few songs are all really good, but this CD's ballads do not stack up with past Blackstreet songs. Also, including the version of Take Me There that doesn't feature Mase was also a bad move in my opinion, as well as including one of the best track's as the CD-Rom only track. Before buying this one, get Blackstreet's first two CD's which are much, much better."
1,Waste of money,"it really sucks trust all the reviews if your thinking about getting this CD-- dont, its a waste of money!"
1,TEDDY RILEY-- YOU NEED HELP BAD,"YA WZUP, I WAS JUST WONDERING IF TEDDY RILEY WAS DOWN WITH CASH MONEY BECAUSE THIS C.D. SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THEY WOULD DO. IT IS 100%WACK. I AM STILL TRIPP'N ON THAT I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT IT. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO LIE AND GET MY MONEY BACK."
4,"""Finally"" is good but has not surpassed, ""Another Level.""","I bought ""Finally"" the second day it came out. I enjoyed it of course because I'm a die hard Blackstreet fan. But if a listener just casually accepts the group then they would probably feel it didn't surpass Another Level (which it didn't) and therefore isn't any good. Still you have to props where they are given, and Blackstreet deserves four stars for this one."
1,What was Teddy thinking?????,"This Cd is a letdown on all levels period.The project is just fake- too many synthesizers & samples of other styles!! Riley used to be an innovator.Now he is a follower!! Time has passed Riley by, and my advice is to get the previous Cd, 'Another Level'.They are now at a VERY LOW LEVEL!!"
4,Blackstreet's Underrated Album,"After releasing 2 straight classic albums in ""Blackstreet"" and ""Another Level"" this ""Finally"" album might seem like a dissapointment but really there's still a lot of great music here that shouldn't be slept on the way it is. My favorite songs are ""Hustler's Prayer"", ""In A Rush"", ""Black & White"", ""Take Me There"", and ""Yo Love"", while it's not Blackstreet's best, it's probably better than 90% of what's been out there recently, definately worth checking."
2,The downward spiral begin with this disc,"After releasing two back to back discs, Blackstreet began their downward spiral with this medicore CD. For starters the group is without the smooth falestto of Mark Middleton and instead were giving Terrel Phillips. Second the huge single Take Me There is presented in a weak remix and finally there's only good ballad on the CD which is Think About You. I don't know what happened to the Blackstreet from the excllent Another Level because they for sure aren't on this disc."
3,I Think I'll Split The Wig a Little Bit Here...,"OK, so we all understand that this BLACKstreet project is not bad. However, compared to their previous two albums, Finally is a major step backwards. Other than ""In A Rush,"" and ""I'm Sorry,"" there really isn't any song on this album that can top the success of their hit single, ""No Diggity,"" from Another Level. Hit hard by poor sales and record label disputes, BLACKstreet ""Finally"" may see the end of their days now that Teddy Riley is focusing on the reunion of Guy. Nevertheless, after a few spins, the songs get just a little more intriguing but not anything too spectacular. A decent effort overall, but saleswise, a disappointment which may have introduced the end of BLACKstreet."
2,It was boring. It's too repetive. It was weak!!!,"A friend of mine gave me the Finally c.d. as a present. I was very excited about it. I had enjoyed their last c.d. ""Another Level"". That was an awesome c.d. I must admit that I was very disappointed when I heard this c.d. It was sooo boring. I mean, I know that these guys seem very sensitive about their female relationships, but it almost seemed soo depressing. It was also very repetitive. What happened to all the spunk and upbeat songs???!!! I still love you, but you need to come up with something a whole lot better next time!! Peace out Blackstreet.. Keep it REAL!!"
2,"Why Blackstreet, Why?","What a disappointment!!!! It's okay at best. The only reason that I keep this CD is because ""In a Rush"" will probably be my wedding song, it's wonderful, and #4 sounds like the Blackstreet I know and love, but the rest of it is kinda suspect. And I'm salty that I had to go to their website to get a password to hear a song on a CD that I already paid for! What's that all about? I don't appreciate that in the least! I will have to hear someone else's Blackstreet next time before I buy it, because it's I can't go on blind faith anymore."
1,Lowest Level...,"While Blackstreet's second album unquestionably took R&B to ""Another Level"", this one took it to it's lowest level. No original sound whatsoever. There is nothing distinctive here. The first 4 songs should appear on a rap/hiphop album. After that, Blackstreet seemed to run out of worthwhile material and relied on fomulaed expositions to finish the album. This wasn't worth the wait. Fans can only hope that their fourth outing will be the real successor to ""Another Level"" because this one just plain sucks."
2,Time has RUN OUT!!!,"I am VERY dissapointed in this project headed by Riley.It lacks a certain character and focus that the last Cd had.The changes in the line-up didn't help the group build on what 'Another Level' started.I hate to say this (and MANY OTHERS feel the same!!), Blackstreet is NOT WORKING TEDDY!! Give this concept up and reform GUY!! I really hate this Cd, and Riley tried to be cute by having a 'hidden track' encoded on this CD for play on computers!! I don't have a PC, so I miss out.I would not recommend this to anyone, and the single with Janet has the same music from Cameron's 'Horse And Carraige', which was unique.I guess Teddy has truly lost it if he has to rely on other's ideas.LEAVE IT ALONE!!!!"
1,The highest heights of disappointment.,"The CD starts off with a blast but after the fifth track (""Drama"") the only song worth listenig to is ""In A Rush"". The CD crash lands with a resounding boom. The enhanced CD track project is destined to be a consumer nightmare."
2,I was left disappointed,"After the first 2 cd's by Blackstreet, I was looking forward to their third. I guess I'll have to wait for their fourth. Their first CD is permanently in my car. This CD will be sold back to a used CD shop. I gave it 4-5 go throughs to see if there was something there, but it never clicked for me. I don't think they should give up or break up. I just think they need to do what's best for them. The first song where they keep repeating ""Give the people what they want""...well, what we want is somebody who doesn't suck up to us and will fully utilize Teddy's creativeness. It did have a good beat though. Do better next time !!!"
2,Go back to the drawing board please!,"I was very disappointed in this album. It sounds like they just threw something together instead of adding more grooves and flavor to their songs. The only good cuts are Girlfriend/Boyfriend, Yo Love, I Got What You On, Drama, and Finally (the best track). Also they spent too much time trying to create an enhanced CD,(which is off the hook)when they should have add more songs to the album. Overall, I had high expectations for this album. Another Level was clearly better."
2,A disappointment.,"What happened to the back to back classics? Ballads and romantic solos? If you're a collector, it's a buy. If you're looking for works similar to Another level, it's not on Finally."
5,"I'm really digging that track ""All I do is think about you""",Think about you is the bomb. Teddy Riley has been hot since the group Guy. I wish him and the whole blackstreet gang much success...
4,Daniel B. a buy,"The eye-trance jacket describes itself as ""full-length emotional & intelligent trance traxx"", and it delivers just that. Daniel B. has assembled an extraordinary collection of mature, sophisticated trance hits - the tunes you'd expect to hear in the clubs late at night after the crowds have thinned. You won't be disappointed by duds on this CD - there aren't any. No breakbeats or sudden tempo shifts either - just pure, consistent and mellowed German trance. The tunes are not mixed, but the purchase includes a 3rd CD containing a special 71 minute mix by Daniel B. A great value and highly recommended."
2,Better Books out there,This book has very little useful information and has repetitive recipes. It is also very inflexible...you would have to recalculate your entire endeavor should you NOT want to make every meal as listed in 2 week plan or 30 day menu's. I also couldn't locate and ensure the coordinating software would rectify the inflexibility. Take a look at this at the library for recipes only. Then just go buy the competitor 30 Day Gourmet book and software!
5,A lifesaver!!,"This is a great cookbook for busy, working moms. When I bought mine, I took it to a office supply store to have it spiralbound because I knew that I would be using it a lot. I substituted some of my own dishes for a couple of recipes that my family didn't like. It really comes in handy during busy school year. I can just pull out a dish from the freezer and put it in the oven. Instead of using pans, I doublebag the recipes in gallon bags and freeze."
3,Once-a-month Cooking,"The book is a great idea but there are some flaws with the shopping list and the ingredients that are actually in the recipe. Also, some of the recipes don't make sense in regards to the cooking day assembly schedule. Also, be aware that they say it takes only 4-5 hours of cooking for the 2 week meal plans, but in reality it is more like 8 hours. There is satisifaction having meals (main course only) ahead of time but the work is a big task. Be prepared for getting very thirsty during your massive cooking day. Have been too afraid to try the one month plan."
2,"Nice execution, too inflexible, lacking some info","The lack of nutritional information is a huge oversight. The menus are pre-planned for 30 days. A mix and match system would be better for those of us who don't eat certain meats or veggies. Because the grocery lists are pre-built around a 30 day menu a simple alteration of a major ingredient in several recipes reduces the simplicity greatly.All that said, in providing 30 day meals for healthy, non-allergic, total omnivores who don't track their intake this book is very well planned and executed."
2,not real impressed,"I do not recommend this book. Lots of repeated recipes, space that could have been used for a little more variety. The only reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is for it's information on freezing food. I wasted my money!"
1,Buyer beware!,"If you are not a devout Christian, you may find this book as offensive as I did. There I was, thinking I was going to get a cookbook to help me get homemade meals on the table a little more often...but what I got was a bunch of proverbs to begin each chapter, and a table talk discussion guide (excuse me, but I think I know how to talk to my own family) that was filled with Jesus questions. As a Jew, it offends me to have spent my money on a religious tract when there was no hint whatsoever that that was what I was purchasing. The funny thing is, if I had known ahead of time that it was full of religious content, I could have made a decision to just ignore it and try the delicious-sounding recipes. But being blindsided by the authors and the publishers left such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm unable to even consider trying them. The book is back in the box, on its way back to Amazon. I hope the next person who gets it is at least forewarned."
5,A life-changing book!,"I bought this book a year ago and it has changed my life. I cooked yesterday and now have 20 meals in the freezer, and all I have to do is warm them up! Once you use this book a couple of times, you can adapt your own recipes. This method is great for both working and stay at home moms (and dads!"
2,Not very wholesome,"The recipes here are just not healthy enough for me. We don't eat a lot of meat and this book relies on the comsumption of meat. For example, for one month's recipes you should buy: 4-6 lb. brisket, 8 lbs ground beef(she says buy more if needed), 1/2 lb. ground turkey, 9 lbs. whole chicken, 5 and 3/4 lb. bonesless chicken, 2 lbs. chicken pieces, 4 strips bacon, 5-6 lbs. am, 1 lb. sausage, 1 lb. veal and 3 ounces pepperoni!! Keep in mind that this meat list is for DINNERS ONLY. I could never serve my family that much meat! I was hoping for more healthy creative meals."
3,"Too-big, starch-rich recipes. Still, worth a shot!","When I first got the book, back in the 90s, the recipes were way too big -- serves 8! I got rid of the book only to buy it again a few years later when I realized I could store the food in smaller portions (duh!).The recipes are mostly way too starchy for me, but everything is outlined: what to buy, what you need for storage, what you need for prep. It titles the steps (summary of processes, freeze in, etc). I recommend this book because most of the recipes are friendly and easy to make.They are also easy to divide (now that I think of it!), good comfort food freeze in case of funerals (bring to the bereaved's home so they don't have to worry about feeding all the visitors), surprise company, new neighbors, etc.There may be better books out there (I've got most of them!), but this is one you should get. Really."
2,Lo-Fat Menu had NO TASTE,"This was the first OMAC book I tried. I was so excited that they had a low-fat entree plan so I made the whole 2 week menu. What a dissapointment!!!!!! I nearly gagged on the Mandarin Orange Chicken, and I was serving that meal to guests. The Split-Pea soup had no flavor and the recipe for Italian Tomato Sauce made everything it touched gag-worthy. I am so glad that I checked this one out from the library instead of buying it...a great dissapointment."
2,"More of The Same 'Ol, Same 'Ol.","If you have any of the prior published versions, there is nothing new in this current one that justifies the purchase."
2,Scam,"I borrowed a copy of Once-a-month Cooking from a friend and loved it so much that I decided to order my own copy, and this is the copy I ordered. I did notice online that the cover looked a bit different from the one I had borrowed, but figured it was just a matter of updating. I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND THAT SOME OF THE BEST RECIPES I USED FROM MY FRIEND'S BOOK WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COPY I NOW OWN! Two examples are: Mimi's Nutritious Bread and Oven Barbequed Chicken w/Cheesy Biscuits. I'll be re-borrowing my friend's copy to get those and other recipes that I want to keep using. There were several others I wanted to try, but waited until my book came. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU BUY, NOT ALL COPIES ARE THE SAME!"
4,Great advice and tips on how to start cooking once a month,"IntroductionChapter 1-Cooking the once-a-month way*Overview*Starting up*Grocery Shopping Hints*The Day before Cooking Day*Food Storage & Freezer Tips*Serving Suggestions*Equipment NeededI wouldn't recommend this book for someone who is a vegetarian or vegan since a lot of the meals in this cookbook contain meat. I would recommend this book for anyone who eats a variety of chicken dishes. This cookbook has lots of chicken recipes in it. For each recipe, it gives you suggestions on what you can serve with it.Chapter 7-There is over 100 conversation starters and table talk questionsChapter 2-6, & Chapter 8 are full of recipes you can freeze.Chapter 9-Adapting the once-a-month cooking method*Choosing Recipes*Making a Memo Calander*Figuring Shopping & Stapes*Setting up an Assembly Order*Evaluating Your PlanChapter 10-Special Helps*Equivalent Measures*Food Handling Tips*Freezer Storage Tips"
1,A can of this and a package of that. . .,"With time at a premium, I could just fill my freezer with prepared fajita mix, lasagnas, or Hungry Man dinners from the supermarket in order to have meals in minutes at the end of a long work day. I was looking for recipes and a system to prepare nutritious meals in advance -- meals that would be healthier for us and taste more homemade than the prepared foods -- and hoped this book would provide it. The recipes in this book, however, use a lot of processed foods, just like Swanson's or other convenience food products. I was pretty dissappointed in them.However, if you and your family enjoy frozen or boxed casseroles, then you will probably enjoy these meals. I can see growing families who already 'go to the freezer and get the box' getting a lot out of these recipes and this system. I should also note that these are budget-conscious meals -- again, a benefit for growing families."
4,Creative concept could save time in the kitchen....,"I really appreciate the ideas listed in this book, however cooking one day a month has been difficult to include into our lives. I thought the recipes were actually good tasting. The concept presented in this book is really clever. Recommend this book to everyone. However, keep in mind that the one day a month you cook will be labor intensive."
5,I'm a born-again Mom thanks to this book!,"The best book I've ever bought! It really works! The book is oriented around families and is meant to help you rediscover family dinners. My kids are in sports 3 days a week and even trying to rush home from work and fix dinner in time to get my son off to practice by 6, we all have time to sit down together. The hardest part is remembering to thaw something the night before - but even then many of the recipes can be thawed in the microwave and eaten right away. My husband, usually critical of my cooking, has enjoyed every dish we've made so far. And one benefit the writers don't mention is that my kids helped me cook adding to our quality time together. While the two week plan actually required a day and a half to cook, it's lasted our family of four 4 weeks and we only eat out one day a week! (I divided some recipes into smaller containers). This is the best book you'll ever buy!"
4,Once a Month Cooking,"I have the first edition of this cookbook and Table Talk. I used this method for about three years and was really pleased to get thru the day and have a meal prepared. I have five children and run a home daycare.I still use the once a month cooking method and use my own recipes as well. My family loves the ""twice baked potatoes"" and many other recipes.It is well worth the time invested to have meals ready to go. I am anxious to view a copy of the newest edition for more exciting recipes that my family will eat. Thanks Mimi and Mary Beth."
3,Not as Flexible as Frozen Assets,"Okay This is a 4 star thought that lost a star because it can't improvise. I have tried both Once a Month Cooking and Frozen Assets. I like Frozen Assets better because we buy according to what is cheap the week we are shopping. FA suggests menus of 4-5 meals according to main ingredients (Chicken, Ground Meat, etc.). several menus is a month. OAMC gives you a short or long mixed menu and you buy accordingly. Both books discuss assembling you own monthly menu, which is of course the best way to do this."
5,This really works,"I thought this was an amazing idea and thought I would give it a chanch. Well I am so glad I did. I did start with the 2 week menu and think it was a good way to ease my way into this plan. The first time I did everything including shopping on the same day. Since I have done my shopping and prep work on one day and cooked on another and it goes great(although I am definatly tired afterwards!). I like having something ready everynight. No more fast food and our grocery bill has really come down, and best of all my family loves the dinners!! I would recommend this to all my friends- and I have and many of them are now doing this too."
5,Good quality,This product is very good. They are durable and are great to use in a classroom library. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,Not Happy!,I thought I was getting a great deal! It really would have been a great deal if the discs weren't so cheaply made! Very thin and every single one I have used doesn't perform properly in a CD player! I'll never take this short cut again. From now on I go to the store and buy them at retail because there really is a difference! These discs are pure garbage!
4,Superb detective story with fascinating characters,"If you enjoy stories about people rather than just 'what happens' then you'll love these books where the characters just keeping better and better. The crime stories are, in their own right, superb but not the real focus. Faye Kellerman is her husband's superior as an author in every aspect."
5,"For a non-Jew, I learned quite a bit!","Since I was given the entire Decker/Lazarus series as a gift this summer, I sure hope I get what I deserve, and it is heading in a positive direction after this book. I learned quite a bit about Judaism, and that is impressive since I am myself Methodist. Gee, Orthodox Jews sure live a strict life, but hey, that's what Moses wants. I am eagerly awaiting to open the pages of SACRED AND PROFANE really soon, and see if Rina is a big help in Peter's next big-time case! I'll tell AMAZON what I think about it as well."
1,The Ritual Bath was a no-show,"Whereas the other books I ordered came in good time, and I was very pleased about, The Ritual Bath was tracked to my house, but never arrived. After reporting this, I never heard a word from Amazon."
3,The Ritual Bath,"The Ritual Bath, by Faye Kellerman is about a rape that takes place outside of a Mikvah in a Jewish community. This is the first book in the series, where Rina and Peter meet. This is a very quick read, without alot of twists and turns. It is just a so-so book. The story lacked a little something throughout."
3,It was ok.,"I chose this book because I wanted a cornie detective book. It was okay, but not my favorite. The characters were kind of shallow and the plot was kind of predictable. If you're interested in an easy read that requires little thought, this book is for you. But if you want something to challenge you, you might want to look elsewhere."
5,The Ritual Bath,"Great, I enjoyed it. I have enjoyed reading other works be Faye Kellerman and hope to read more in the future."
5,I am hooked!,"I had never read Faye Kellerman before this novel. I travel a lot and listened to one of her audio books (The Burnt House). I enjoyed listening to it. The narrator, George Guidall, makes everything sound good. I liked the Peter Dekker character and wanted to start at the beginning of the series. I found The Ritual Bath and decided to Dee if reading Faye Kellerman was as interesting as listening to her. IT IS! I am now on a mission to read and/or listen my way through the series. I love her characters and the inside views of Jewish customs."
3,Disappointing,I was hoping to learn about the Jewish culture and found some interesting parts. Many Hebrew words were used however without explanation. Story was good but non pulsed. A disappointing conclusion to the story.
2,Lacking,Could not finish it. Predictable and shallow characters. Story line was not enough to keep me going with the lack of writing quality.
5,The Ritual Bath,"A wondeful book! I enjoyed the interesting setting inside of a Yeshiva, and learned a lot about the community. What a thriller and page-turner. Such fun!"
3,Not one of Ms. Kellerman's best,"I may have been me, but Ms. Kellerman seems to have been in somewhat of a fog when writing this particular Decker novel. I breezed through it and knew the ending by the third chapter. Quite unusual for this writer."
4,Mejores Montas en el Estado de Mexico VHS,When did it end?I remembered this movie and it has a lot of damn bulls and good bull riders in the 1990s. I don't know what happened to this movie and the tape was clean. My family bought it in 2001 but in June 2008 I put it on the top of TV an the next day it disappeared. I think someone stole it.
4,"Good Hydration pack, but not a great backpack","I really liked the hydration pack. There is not as much as room as you might think, but manageable. There is no plastic taste even on the first use. You might endup taking a backpack & and this hydration pack if you need to carry lot of items."
4,good product,This is a good product. Well made and works perfectly. Would recommend it. The only thing I would suggest is a strap at the front
1,"Beware - Internet Radio a ""hoax""","Onkyo ceased providing Internet Radio through their Net-Tune products some time ago, but still advertise that it works (which it does not). MP3 content through network is working great, but no internet radio."
3,20th Maine,"This video is a must for any Civil War buff of Gettysburg. It centers more around the 20th Maine than it does for MG Chamberlain though. Great research included of photos and primary sources. It also gives great resources for more research. Though it is an ancillary source, it still gives a wide breadth to the soldiers and sons of Maine!"
4,A nice surprise in '87,"Lolita Pop is a Sweedish band that was formed in 1986. Richard Lloyd helped out with this band. They had some good music here: ""Ship Comes Loaded"", a song that could of been a hit ""Bang Your Head"", ""Trains Of Longing"", Mind Your Eye"" and ""Rain Of Days"". I can't believe I'm the first reviwer, I know they sold more than 1 copy. Good vocalist in Karin Wistrand."
3,Expected More But Not Disappointed,"Like someone else said, I read this because we homeschool. I had heard what a great book this was but when I got it I was honestly a little disappointed. I'm sure if my kids were still in public school it would have been more useful but it just wasn't any help to us as homeschoolers/unschoolers.I'd still recommend it to people who are disenchanted with the public school system but I know now not to recommend it so much to my fellow homeschoolers."
4,"helpful book, worth a read","I found this book to be a pretty good read. I was looking for something to reaffirm our decision to homeschool, and it didn't do tha for me as much as I would have liked, but it was really interesting, and although it doesn discuss the bad aspects of going to school, it isn't down on school at all-- just helps people recognize where problems might lie and helps to address those issues.I think this is a great book for all parents, those homeschooling and those traditionally schooling-- any parent that is interested in helping thier child learn to love to to learn will find this book to be full of good information."
4,Great book for those of us with one foot out the door,Great for those parents like myself who really believe in unschooling but are not brave enough or do not have the support to go all the way. This helps me find a middle ground from which we(our family) can move in any direction ( to school or not to school) while keeping the joy of learning alive for our children.
4,great writing style*interesting story*mediocre theology,"I enjoy Miller's casual writing style. As a fellow Christian, I found it interesting to read about his spiritual journey, although I'm not sure I'd change anything major in my own life based on his beliefs. I would put quite a bit more thought and research into the matter before doing so. He's definitely part of the emergent church movement, although he'd probably deny it. I got his next book, In Search of God Knows What, mostly because I love the way he writes, but I'm not enjoying it as much."
5,"Radically different, yet extremely human","Coming from a christian perspective, this book has rocks. It is unlike any other ""spiritual"" book I've read. I love that the book is random and orderless. It makes it easier to relate to what he is saying. He writes like we think. I love that Don is not about institution but rather about the heart of spirituality. He believes in relationship with Jesus and in turn reflecting that in our relationship with humans. He visited my school for a few days and I was able to go to a few of the conferences he offered. It was so exciting to see this man's twist on the Gospel to made into something completely fresh and life changing for the people in the room. He has inspired me in so many ways from his thoughts in his book and his personal character."
4,I didn't want to read it but I did,"Somebody at church gave me this book and I thought it would depress me--something about the title, I hear saxophones and I start getting gloomy. But it wasn't what I expected. The writer is a little self-absorbed, maybe, but very hopeful and even funny.I'd highly recommend Home is Always the Place You Just Left, by Betty Smartt Carter. It's the same kind of writing, but from a female perspective. Very funny but quite brilliant and sad..."
2,Blue Like Jazz,"I ordered 2 books which were supposed to be in excellent condition. One book was fine, the second book had a huge streak down the whole front cover. I was disappointed because I planned to give the book as a gift. It looked damaged."
1,Ridiculous Book,"I have had people gush over this book and I hoped to like it at least a little, since Christians need to expand out of their rigid, frightened huddles. Two pages into it I found he wasn't much of a writer; further on I learned how much Don Miller thinks about himself and how he really can't accept that Christianity and ""coolness"" (whatever that is) will always be at odds. Gosh darn it! And throwing around a couple f-words etc, is a cheap way to prove you are free in Christ. It's discouraging that Christians are rushing to proclaim this is edgy reading and good literature. It's a juvenile book and feels like a rip-off of all the real pop-culture he wants so badly to be a part of. It belongs in the ""almost-like"" section of the Christian bookstores."
5,AWESOME book - really moved me,"Blue Like Jazz is a hard book to explain. Basically, the author describes his spiritual progression, but not in typical 'church' language. He tells stories and issues he's had. Many of the things he describes I have felt personally, I just could never articulate them the way he can. One of my favorite things about this book was his writing style. It was almost as if he were an old friend just sitting down and talking to you. It was almost like a strem of conciousness writing, which I like. This book got me to reassess my own faith."
2,Nah...,"I'm not well-versed in religious/spiritual literature; this was my first foray into the genre. I chose it because the Amazon community rated it highly... BUT, I have to say that this was largely a waste of time, though I was warned on the front cover-- Publishers' Weekly called it ""enjoyably clever""-- I've never thought of 'clever' as a compliment..."
4,Re-thinking my original opinion,"I am actually re-reading this book because I got so much out of it during my first read. I may have made a mistake by reading all these negative reviews here, but I'm finding I agree with some of them to an extent. It's funny because I am seeing both sides here, both good and bad, about the book. Yes, some of the stuff he wrote about is a little self-obsessed, but some of the stuff he wrote sparked real passion in me and furthered my relationship with God. I think I just had a moment of realization (an epiphany, if you will) that you cannot take ANYONE'S word for anything, except God's. This is just more proof to me that people, no matter who they are or what their intentions or how close to Christ they are, can lead you astray. To conclude; read the book (it has some good stuff in it), take from it what you will, and trust God with all your heart."
1,Subjectivist Poop,"Don is a good writer, and makes many good critiques in the chapters on love and community, but towards the end of the book his message begins to boil down to ""what you feel individually, is true for you individually"". A concept for which i find far from the universal truths presented in the Bible. I lament the brief popularity of this slightly heretical book and any influence it might have had to lead to a more laisser faire kind of Christian life."
2,Unimpressed,"I am just a few pages into it but, while modestly interesting, I am finding it hard to understand what the rage is all about with this book. His ""confessional"" and self-effacing style is commendable. However, it doesn't add to crying need for true Christians to become serious students of their faith. It adds to the comfort seeking of our age but, not much so far, to pointing the reader to Christ. I will slog through a couple more chapters but, I doubt I will finish the book"
2,No time for bad books,"I purchased this book because I was intrigued with the subject matter, but unfortunately I discovered that the writer must either be very young or intended to appeal to a younger audience. I was bored out of my mind by chapter 2. I'm sorry, but I just don't have time to spend reading such dribble."
4,Surprised by honesty,"When most people speak about the Christian faith they are often afraid to speak the truth, not so for Don Miller. This book will make comfortable Christians uncomfortable and challenge their thinking. Doubts, disappointments and struggles are often not discussed, but this book faces them head-on. There aren't simple answers, yet in many ways the solutions are of faith and trusting the gospel. College students love this book and the realism. As one long past college graduation it hit home and reminds me that our youth have a lot to say about Word and Deed.Keep on writing Don!!"
4,Very Good Book,"The book was very good,and easy to read. I could not put it down. His non christian thoughts are not very non christian. He presented is views in a was that was not offensive. I see dirty hippies just a little diffrent now."
1,"Cheesy, Depressing and Self-Important","I have read some very eloquent 1-star reviews here, and I appreciate their depth and specificity. I am going to give my quick 2 cents.I read most of this book, excited about what pearls of wisdom I could gather from this man's reflections on God, and all I got was self-important musings mixed with cheesy, nostalgic imagery. This book lacks substance and it was a waste of time."
4,Atypical,"Definitely not your typical Christian books, and for that reason, it's one of my favorites. I feel that the Christian culture has become so cut off from the world, not in a sense of bettering ourselves, but simply separation. This book brings you back to reality, makes you see that not everyone shares the exact same view, and that's okay. I think everyone should have to read it, particularly most closed-minded people, but those are who would be most offended. Some need to be offended, get out of your comfort zone. I love the introduction, it pulls you in. And no, it's not all about doctrine and scriptures, the subtitle accurately explains: Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality. If you go in with the right mindset, you'll love it. God is bigger than our small human minds, some day we need to realize it."
3,Interesting perspective!,This is a very interesting take on Christian spirituality. My Sunday school class is studying it and there has been great discussion. We have very mixed age groups in our class and this has been a good book to study.
4,a searching Christian connects,"Donald Miller's book 'Blue Like Jazz' is about how an unsophisticated seeker finds ways to get close to the spirit of Jesus. At the language level of an advanced teenager, Miller describes how he helped to bring people the kind of relationship to Jesus that they were seeking. His writing speaks to the hunger for deeper meaning that many of his contemporaries want to find. His is a tale full of actual people and real events. I enjoyed reading it."
1,Forgettable,"This was an easy but unrewarding read. Unlike the stunning coexistence of humility and confidence found in the ""Confessions"" of St. Augustine, Miller shocks with his ability to combine insecurity with arrogance. While I appreciate his call for Christianity to be relevant, Miller's attacks on the religious, political, social, and cultural establishment are more about his own frustration with societal acceptance than they are about really living one's faith."
3,Eh...,"Blue Like Jazz is a simple read. Don Miller is an insightful guy. He is mindful of the presence of God in the world around him. I appreciate that he challenges the political conservatism of American Christianity and puts a new face on Christian Literature.I enjoyed the read but I can't, for the life of me, figure out how Donald Miller's name has come to be spoken in the same breath as Anne Lamott or Leonard Sweet. Don Miller is a good writer but he lacks the eloquence and depth of Lamott and Sweet.I recommend this book if you are beginning to feel disillusioned with Christianity in America and its celebrated voices. Don Miller will make you stop and think about some things. If you have been working through your disillusionment for some time, you may read this, as I did, and say to yourself, ""And...?""PAXErik"
5,Non-Religious?,"A matter of semantics perhaps. One might say that if religion is doctrine et cetra. This book is certainly ""spiritual"" and it rates high with me. I have to admit to being from the old school that uses no swear, cuss or cheap slang in spiritual matters, but I hold strongly to all his concepts of talking to God as a friend, enjoying God in so many different ways and knowing that God is the essence of love. If we really love God we will love and share with others. If we don't love and share then we don't really love Him. It is that simple.I would eagerly give this book to anyone under 65 with an open mind to read about one man's views on spiritual journeying. I thought of a dozen or more people to order it for as I read and I am so very glad someone at Seminary recommended it. Incidentally I would really like to get to know the author!Chaplain Dawn McF"
1,"It was painful, but.....","It was painful, but I managed to get through it. I will confess that I felt an urgency after reading lengthy segments to get my Bible out and read through a Psalm or two, or a chapter in Matthew. It was sort of like needing to take a bath after wallowing in the mud. So many reviews have been made, but I wanted to add one thing of my own. In his book, Donald Miller has created a God from his own imagination to worship, a God that is OK with him as he is. The God he refers to is simply not the God of the Bible, but the God of ""whatever"". It's not cool."
1,Unsafe at any speed,"Christianity comes in basically two flavors: its terms, and our terms. Blue Like Jazz clearly chooses the second. There is something very alluring about the notion that Jesus accepts me as I am. Mr. Miller has done a masterful job of discovering and communicating that insight. Trouble is, there is no point of continuity between his version of Christianity and Christ's.Once Christianity is severed from the Bible, it has no moorings in anything solid. While ""Jesus words"" fit nicely into a lot of philosophical mindsets, it is mortally dangerous to go there.There is a common illusion that if a given structure (such as traditional Christianity) has been seen to be abusive, the solution is to eliminate the structure. No one seems to notice that the absence of structure is far more devastating than the previous abuse."
5,In a word...refreshing.,"This is a great book for believers who are tired of the ""God-talk"" that overshadows real faith and for non-believers who want an honest, open account of one person's journey of faith in the real world."
3,"Some good, some so-so","Overall, the book was pretty okay. I think it would depend on where someone is with their spiritual walk on how much they liked the book. It is written in a very ""non-religious"" way, and there are some parts where the truth is quite poignant. One part I found very insightful (section where he's talking about a play he wrote, with a couple on the verge of divorce, and the husband is talking to his wife while she's sleeping) and really brought me to tears. On the other hand, a lot of the writing sounds the same as earlier parts, kind of predictable; I found myself tiring of his style after awhile. So, overall it's okay. Some truth, depends on what you need to hear at this stage."
5,A GREAT READ.,"In reading Donald Miller's Blue Like Jazz, I found myself laughing out loud and being deeply convicted within the same sentence. His words and stories are well chosen, without sounding stuffy, and his message is one which I have long wished to live out. This is one of the first books I have read in a long time that lets a man's faith be lived out honestly, out of the box, and still true to the centrality of faith: a love relationship with Jesus. I felt as though many chapters were telling my story. Thankfully, this is not your typical ""Christian"" book. Nowhere does Miller try to force you one way or another, but seeks to encourage readers to live authentic lives. Read it."
2,Should have been a pamphlet,"I thought at first that the book was going to go somewhere, perhaps share real deep insights on living out spirituality. Instead it just rambles.The author lacks basic knowledge about other paths of spirituality. i.e. He talks about Buddhism being about ""rubbing a fat guy's belly"" to grant wishes. That's pretty insulting toward most serious Buddhists.If I were you I'd just read ""The Message"" - don't bother wasting your time on this pointless rambling.To REALLY get a grip on real-life Christian spirituality, read some spiritual classics like ""Practicing the Presence of God"" by Brother Lawrence or ""Imitation of Christ"" by Thomas a Kempis."
1,Ugh..post-modernism.. nothing new.,"I thought he put forth some decent points, and told some interesting anecdotes in this particular book, but, for me, it ended up being just another post-modern view of the ""Christian"" experience, and world - one in the endless line of modern pop-Christian tomes, maybe the defining one, but overdone, and under-achieving in real content nonetheless.If you want to read a book with legit content, that is still accessible, pick up something by Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, or any number of other Christian authors who have really been taken hold of by the gospel, and don't just like to opine about it, instead."
5,Wonderful Recommendation,"This book was recommended to me by a friend and it was all he said it would be. Donald Miller speaks with realness and there are times when you will have to re-read a paragraph it is so good and so deep. Other parts of the book are funny. If you are a fan of Miller's, you will not want to miss this one."
3,"Interesting read, bad theology..","Overall, I'd say this book is very well written and has interesting stories. While some very good points are made throughout the book it often almost encourages people to go make foolish decesions in the name of ""experience"". It's not the type of book that you read if you want to know God more. I'd consider it a book to read for mere entertainment. So, interesting read, bad theology."
5,I'm glad I'm not the only one...,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who is tired of being boxed in by the Christian culture in this country. After reading this book, I feel refreshed in my faith. Chapter after chapter, Miller illusrates how being with God should be so simple (that's not the same as EASY). Love people--not because you're trying to convert them, but because we're called to love for love's sake. God is love. Be with people--because you'll never see your faults when you're all alone. Keep perspective--the ""church"" doesn't always get it right. If we're not focused on Jesus, we're going the wrong direction."
1,Wannabe Bohemian,"IMHO Miller is either confused or dishonest. On the one hand he talks about God as though he believes the Bible's description, on the other he muses about ""the gods"". At best he is motivated by a desire to meet the agnostic or unchurched halfway, but I have a problem with his ""the ends justify the means"" approach.At worst, his goal in writing Blue Like Jazz was to portray himself as hip, cool, and cutting edge. He seems desperate to impress the ""in crowd"", and thus doesn't hesitate to rip into ""Fundamentalists"" (whatever that means), Republicans, and Evangelicals. You know, man, like it's cool to rip them because everyone KNOWS how BACKWARDS they are...just read the newspaper, man, it's as clear as mud! Yeah Don, all the cool people hate those unenlightened Fundamentalists, so you're safe...you're IN baby!"
2,Blue Like Jazz: Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality,"Interesting story but really does not share about being discipled. He writes well but glorifies the selfish lifstyle and not how God rescues us from death and gives us ""RESURECTION LIFE""."
4,gift for a nineteen year old,It was a easy fun read for my nineteen year old son. He enjoyed the writing style and the narrative stories.
1,Highly Overrated,"I was a bit excited to get a copy of this book as I've heard a good deal about it. So I picked up a copy and read it in a day which is a bit unusual for me. All in all I was extremely disapointed in every aspect imaginable. Donald Miller spends the entire book rambling as if he were on an acid trip. His jesus seems to be more the type of say a hispanic fellow (Heyzeus)who sells drugs down on the corner. He preaches a gospel of love without justice; one in which a hippie jesus comes over and wants to chat and share his bong with you. Holiness is apparently not all that important, but then again love is all that matters. Blue like Jazz is a waste of time and a hindrance to anyone's spiritual growth..."
2,Whatever!,"I give this book two stars rather than one, because the writing style is interesting. The content? That is a different matter altogether. I am a long-time Jazz fan. My love for Jazz music is subjective. So is the ""christianity"" of this book. The problem is, Christianity is not based on subjectivism, but on objective [absolute, transcendent] truth.I'll keep the book on my shelf along with other volumes on music and worship--not because the book is about those topics, but because I like Jazz music, and the word JAZZ is predominantly displayed on the book's spine. Does that sound like a non sequitur? So is this book."
1,Read New Seeds by Thomas Merton instead,"A well-meaning friend gave me this book so I was obligated to read it. I can't believe that a person who i know to be a truely loving human being would recomend such a hateful book. Miller is obviously non-religious as there is no real theological base for most of what he says, that does not stop him however, from being an ideologue who insults other faiths which are not his own Buddhism, Islam, ect. If you want to read a great book that will really get you thinking about the Christian faith read Thomas Merton's New Seeds Of Contemplation, especially the section entitled Moral Theology Of The Devil. It's theologically sound, Non-religious and comes from a true love of Jesus rather than a true love of self like this book seems to be"
1,Tripe,"Burns me up to see such tripe getting media attention. My five-year-old niece can articulate more deeply-considered thoughts than Miller does in this utter waste of time.I thought that after we got rid of George Bush, shallow thinking poorly presented would stop being cool. Sigh.My old lit. teacher would call this book, Mental Masturbation."
1,Started with high hopes...,"I had high hopes for this book when I started, hoping for a view into one man's developing spirituality. Instead, I found just one more self-absorbed, pseudo-spiritual tome lamenting the fact that we are all flawed in some way, the world would be so much better if we recognized this, and why can't we all just get along?I really wanted to like this book but just can't. A waste of money."
2,At least it's not the Prayer of Jabez,"When used as an adjective ""Christian"" is often synonymous with ""bad."" This work on ""Christian Spirituality"" is consistent with that.Miller's insights are fair, but hardly need the meandering set up. Maybe it was contractual obligation, more than creativity that made this work so long (read tedious).It's disappointing, to say the least, if this is what passes for profound spirituality in evangelical circles."
2,Jesus? or Don Miller?,"I realize this is a work of apologetics (an argument for the Christian faith), though not in the traditional sense. It's not like Augustine's City of God or more modern works such as G. K. Chesterton's Orthodoxy, or C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity. I really wanted to like the book, but in the end I couldn't. When I read Augustine, or Chesterton, or Lewis, or Oswald Chambers or any of several dozen others I could name, I hear Jesus speaking. When I read Blue Like Jazz, all I can hear is Don Miller, with a big dose of smug self-righteousness perched on his shoulder. I know he ends the book with a chapter on Jesus, and I trust that he really does know Jesus, and more importantly, that Jesus knows him; but I couldn't see Jesus because Don Miller kept getting in the way."
2,"How to be a trendy ""Jesus Follower""","Mr. Miller writes passionately and gives good examples about how we can love our neighbor as ourself and love others as Jesus does, but when it comes to to being in the world but not part of it, I wonder if the author has really looked that closely at the teachings of Christ.His goal of the book seems to be an effort to show the world how cool Jesus is and how uncool those who follow the fundamentals of the Bible really are. Rules are for losers, so lets just love everyone like Jesus and not reject everyone for their wrong actions. After all Jesus never had any enemies...right?"
2,Talk about agenda...,"I really enjoyed the first 100 or so pages until he started creeping in the Republican bashing. He talks about churches having agendas and I couldn't help but feel he had his own agenda to distance himself from the Christian ""Republican wackos."" (His own words) In the same breath he discusses not holding grudges or feeling anger. Sorry Don, you lost me at wacko. But it's ok, Jesus still loves flaming, bleeding heart Liberals."
1,Editor???,"I felt this book was poorly written. This was the first time I had read anything by Donald Miller. If I had to guess I would say it was written by an adolescent. I had a difficult time following the author's ""musings"" and never assumed there was a point to anything. He seemed to ramble on and on with random thoughts. It reminded me of times when you start a movie and you keep thinking it's got to get better at some point, and in the end you're quite disappointed that you wasted valuable time. I have to question the capability of the editor..."
1,Cool Cat Christian !!! (bible anyone ???),"Don Miller writes an immature diary that somehow is supposed to liberate all of us uptight believers from an overly restrictive faith. Here is the deal: Shock the reader with totally hip sin, espouse cynicism towards conventional Christianity, ask thought provoking questions, have no answers. Don Miller is the king of Cool Christians- just read this doo doo and he will teach what he deems as ""fake"" and ""real"".I'm not totally sure what his goal was, but it clearly missed the marked for anything spiritual.A friend of mine raved about this book and now is buying it for everyone. She gave me a copy and I was very disturbed by his self righteous, and judgemental attitude (the very thing he attempts to indict!)This book has distorted one of my good friends thinking and I feel it is a detriment to anyone trying to walk closer with Christ."
4,Blue Like Jazz Book on CD,I am an actor and called to audition for the new film being produced based on this book. I wanted to become more familiar with the material.It was awesome. Thought provoking and entertaining at the same time.You won't be disappointed
5,Good Book,"Blue Like Jazz: Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality by Donald Miller is a book that presents the Gospel but only as short essays that discuss theological topics like faith, belief, grace, church and confession. The topic of Jazz is included in the title because according to the author he ""never liked jazz music because jazz music doesn't resolve"" and according to Miller, he used to ""not like God because God didn't resolve.""+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Are You In Spiritual Darkness Or Are You On The Path To Enlightenment? +++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
4,Good Read,"There were some parts about this book that I absolutely loved, and others that I didn't. I guess that could go for any book in particular. It's a really really easy read in a more simplified narration. As someone who likes to get really deep into things this proved a bit of a stumbling block as far as really enjoying it. However, it brought up some great points in ways that I had never thought of before. Overall a great choice!"
3,Enjoyable read.,"I'm almost done reading BLUE LIKE JAZZ. I don't practice anything remotely religious, but I still really enjoy Don Miller's candid and unpretentious spiritual self-analysis. His book is insightful and overal more philosophical than anything, but it also has segments that had me laughing out loud (once while waiting in my doctors office, causing the receptionist to eyeball me over the counter).The only part I didn't really care for and kind of had me rolling my eyes was when he discusses how ""Satan"" can influence us. I just don't go for that ""Devil made me do it"" kind of stuff. I believe that most people have the gift of thought, conscience and self-control. Yes, there are people capable of doing evil things, but blaming a boogyman simply sounds juvenile and proves we're not willing to take responsibility for our own actions."
3,The Rev. Dr. William R. Nirote,"Scott Brick does an excellent job narrating Donald Miller's ""Blue Like Jazz."" The subtitle is ""Nonreligious Thoughts of Christian Spirituality."" The author describes his struggles to come to terms with Christianity as an adult. He explains how he comes from a rather narrow religious upbringing and sets out to be authentic in his Christian life through various journeys. The author actually uses religious and nonreligious thoughts throughout the book, including religious verbiage with a rather conservative bent. The book does criticize both President Bush (43) and his administration, revealing how dated the book is. WRN"
4,Pass it on,"I recommend this book to believers and non-believers alike. If you grew up ""in the church"" you heard about loving your neighbor and not being a ""Sunday Christian"", but didn't really know what that meant, this book clears it up. Buy it, read it, pass it on, buy another copy, read it again!"
3,Spiritualism vs. Christianity,"I agree with the others who have posted for the most part. The author is a genuine, likable, interesting person, and the book is difficult to put down. However, BE AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPIRITUALISM AND CHRISTIANITY. I read this book after hearing so many Christians proclaim how great and inspirational it is, but this book is not at all about Christian doctrine or the love of Christ. I would classify the authors beliefs as more Buddhist than Christian, and the reader should be aware of this. Fun read though, interesting philosophy."
5,A fun book to read about living in faith,"This book reads quickly and is entertaining. The title is just right. The book is about enjoying a life of faith in Jesus like you enjoy jazz. Written from a different mindset than most Christian books, it's worth reading. It jars some of the acceptable Christian ideas but in an entertaining way"
5,The top of my favorites list!!,Absolutely amazing combination of funny sarcasm and startling revelation. Miller manages to take a fresh new perspective on my simple ideas of the Christian faith without quoting the whole Bible. An excellent book for both the unbeliever and the believer alike!
4,Blue Like Jazz,"In many respects, this is so like a book written by a 20-something-year-old: a little self-absorbed and self-consciously hip. But there is also much humor and wisdom in it."
1,Church in crisis? Donald to the rescue!,"Thank goodness! Over 2,000 + years of boring old tradition, square churches, and legalism can now be corrected by Donald Miller. This guy moves from Texas to Oregon and realizes he needs a bigger suitcase to move Christianity with him: Extreme faith makeover, Christianity addition. I discerned two points from this book: (1) smoking and drinking are not sins and (2) Christians don't all think like fundamentalists. These revelations hardly require you to invest your time and money in blue like jazz. Take Calvin, take Hayek, take hope."
3,Blue Like Jazz,"This is christian realism- make no mistake. It is a story of struggle, becoming, and honesty. There is no slick packaging, no pitches, just the author giving an honest look into reality and into himslef. What I enjoyed about this book is the author's emergence from individualism to a more communal lifestyle. This book is not to be sped-read, but taken slowly, meditated on. It is a human story full of emotions- finally . . . human!"
4,Great book for young people and old alike,I liked this book very much and would recommend for any young person searching for God. I believe anyone that has spent any time searching for the meaning will be good.
2,Received an incomplete book...,"Although I really liked this book, I do not know the ending. The book I received was missing the last 30 pages of it and replaced with another portion of an earlier chapter. I would have appreciated a proper copy sent to me instead of a refund. I would expect for a company like Amazon to review what is being sent from their vendors. The book came quickly, but now I have a copy of an unfinished book."
3,Indicitive of Today's Society,"This book had its moments. Some of it was good, while some of it was just a totally focused reference point to the College in which the author audited. I felt the book was going to have more of a reference to people who had thoughts on religion from a wider spectrum than limited to the area in which he lives and attends school. I thought the book was a relfection of today's society which is good and bad in iteself. The good...it really gives insight on how scattered and directionless the ""post-modern"" society is. I felt the book at times, rambled without any direction and sometimes forced itself back into the chapter titles. The bad...I really got bogged down during the rambling stages of the book and didn't really feel that Reed College was a true representation of the non religious populace as a whole. Would I recommend it? Yes. I believe it is a worthwhile read and I am planning to get the other two books by the author."
2,church basher,"As a Christian, I appreciated certain aspects of this book. That said, this author starts on a personal rant against conservative, church-going Christians that starts somewhere near the middle of the book and spirals to such a personal agenda that I wanted to throw the book by the time I got to the final chapters!"
4,Blue Like Jazz,The book drags on at times but there are some great nuggets of wisdom contained within. It is a good read for anyone struggling with their faith.
5,Blue Like Jazz Review,"This book is a wonderful, fast, and easy read. I recommend it for anyone interested in reading a book about Christianity from a view-point other than that of the 'in your face' type. I've loved every minute spent reading it and I know you will too."
3,Don't forget it is a personal memoir!!,"I liked this book more than I originally anticipated. It is well written, entertaining, and contains some decent insights. It is strong on addressing poverty, not confusing Christianity with Jesus, and living humbly before God and man.It is crucial that the genre of personal memoir is kept in mind. It is not a systematic theology or manifesto for the church! One concern is that many immature Christians read this as a blueprint for Christian living rather than the personal memoir that it is.The stream of conscious approach made for some rough transitions. The author's repetitious use of ""cool"" gets a bit annoying and the common use of ""I"" is a bit ironic considering that the author is seeking to push back on individualism. The memoir genre is vulnerable to self-indulgence and the author may fall prey to that particular vulnerability.I appreciate that the author is clear on sin, but his view of sanctification may be a bit sketchy."
2,"Nothing groundbreaking, would give it a 2.5 if I could.","The book was OK. I finished it. There was nothing I would call groundbreaking in this tome. He's an engaging writer in his own way (sory of reminds me of a poor-man's Bill Bryson).Strangely enough, the front cover states, ""Nonreligious Thoughts On Christian Spirituality"". This is untrue. Take, for example, the last paragraph:""...But what song will you sing when your soul gets set free?...If you haven't done it in a while, pray and talk to Jesus...Ask Him to forgive you of self-addiction, ask Him to put a song in your heart.""Now, whether or not one agrees with his thoughts, this doesn't sound very ""Nonreligious,"" does it?"
3,"easy read, but not a light read","Although I haven't finished this book yet, I'm already glad I invested in it. Since I've been away from organized religion for quite a few years, I can be more objective about separating church-going from faith and/or spirituality. This book takes a while to get through because each chapter deserves rereading before moving on to the next. The author raises good points for every day living and dealing with current issues. I couldn't give it more stars because I haven't finished the book, but if the first few chapters are any indication, the book overall should be a ""keeper""."
5,It really got to me.,"It's the first book I finished since finishing Catcher in the Rye over two years ago. It really got to me. I got it on a Wednesday night and I took Thursday off so I could just spend more time reading it. I don't know if it's a great book, I really don't. I just know that it really got to me.I had a copy sent to my friend Keiser the painter. He tends to be sadder than I am, maybe because he's read The Stranger and I haven't yet. Yesterday, I was talking to Keiser at The Blue Lion where we meet and drink coffee. He told me that it was getting to him too and that it was waking up something that has been near dead for a long time. He find's Don's thoughts beautiful. I agree, but painters know beauty better than I do. So, I'd take his word on that."
2,Not a great book for teens.,"If you want to give your teenager the message that it is okay to use drugs and alcohol - and that God doesn't care if you're high all the time as long as you love - then Miller's book is the one for you. What is damaging about this book and its message is in what it DOESN'T say. Oh, another person for whom to buy this book is someone who likes penguin sex.I find it disturbing to know how popular this book is among bible study classes for teens, as it gives the idea that Christianity requires nothing of those who believe. In fact, it encourages people to remain stuck in their self-absorption, sinful behaviors, drug use, etc. What Miller presents here exalts the hippy lifestyle and discards/attacks mainstream Christianity."
2,Soft-spoken radical,Blue Like Jazz caused quite a stir as I read it and discussed it with friends. The easy transparency of Miller's self-examination energized me to look deeply at my own spiritual motivations. It appears that Miller has grown impatient waiting for spiritual renewal to rectify cultural unfairness and now embraces secular humanists to speed the upheaval. Beware of soft-spoken radicals!
5,Blue Like Jazz,I am still reading the book and am finding it very enjoyable. I think the writer has a great way of expressing his views and ideas.
5,"review--great book, and good condition","great book, read it and then bought one for a friend. was in good condition, true to seller's word, and timely. would highly recommend this book, cannot say enough good things about it."
4,Great Book,I loved this book. At times it felt like as if Don Miller was reaching into my brain and writing exactly how I felt. He reached me and connected with me at a level that I did not expect. I could not put the book down once I started reading it. The book made me feel like I wasn't alone in my journey to figure out my place with christianity. This is not just a story for religious people but anyone. Its a story about finding yourself. It was great!!
3,Good food for thought,"I can't say that this was as stimulating as I thought it would be. There was some good food for thought in there, but nothing that profound. It wouldn't be one of the first books that I would recommend to someone else."
5,Being With People,"Donald Miller helped me to see how I can be with people better. If you are like me you spend a considerable amount of time not paying attention to the person in front of you. Don's patience with the atheist pastor's daughter at Reed was perfect. He wasn't thinking about his own college course work or all the many irons he had in his fire. I don't think Don was saying we should just completely skip our responsibilities in life, but I think he sounded an important clarion call for an attentive ear to everyone God brings into our path. Americans aren't known for their patience, and Don's book calls for more gentleness and kindness. I think when you come away from reading Blue Like Jazz you sense Don's urgency for a life of love. There are many hurting and angry people in the world, and it is our call to help ourselves and others find resolve in the midst of our blue times, and praise God if Jazz music (espresso in my case) helps us find it."
2,It's hip to be square?,"This was another paint-by-numbers ""memoir"" from a christian trying to make christianity seem cool and in touch with the world. The author covered the bases, he told a story about getting drunk (which he seemed to do after only a few beers and felt sick an hungover afterwards, just to throw in a ""drinking is bad m'kay"" spin...what guy gets that drunk after 2 or 3 beers anyways? Then in his quest for relevancy an hipness, he mentions seeing a lesbian couple in the park. ""Oh how edgy!"" Ever been to Atlanta in the spring? The rest of the book continues with jaunts into other supposedly controversial topics like being exposed to pot, etc., but yet somehow he still comes across as a naive but morally intact christian.If this is a christian bestseller, it only goes to point out how out of touch the church is with the world around them. Do we really have to get our ""hippness"" from living vicariously though this authors supposed ""liberal christian lifestyle."" ...As if."
1,if I could give it negative stars I would,Don't waste your time or your money. Stabbing myself with a dull pencil would have been more enjoyable
1,What if Holden Caulfield wrote a book?,"I don't remember where I stumbled across a reference to this book, but it was positive enough that I picked up a copy. Chapter one started off well enough, but mid-way through chapter two, I was brought to a dead halt by a major case of deja vu. It took me a couple of minutes to pinpoint it - Holden Caulfield. Remember him from high school English class? Protagonist in ""The Catcher in the Rye""? Annoying as hell? Well, I guess if Holden had written a book, this is what it would have been like. Tone, sentence structure, general outlook, all Holden. I soldiered on through another chapter hoping to shake the reference, but no, things didn't get any better. I threw in the towel. Unless you're an English major, or have an affinity for the annoyingly pretentious and immature, I recommend giving this one a pass."
5,A must read for anyone interested in spiritual issues,"Many of my wise and spiritual friends recommended that I read Blue Like Jazz. Having said that, I went into reading the book with very high expectations. And Blue Like Jazz did not disappoint. Not only is the book incredibly easy to read and thought provoking, it is moving and relatable to any person who has at any time considered spirituality and the meaning of life. Donald Miller is an engaging writer whose honesty and openness about his own life encourages his readers to ask questions and to challenge themselves to new ideas about old themes. I highly enourage any person even slightly interested in spiritual issues to take the time to read this book."
1,Think about what you want before you purchase.,"It is, in fact, stated that is ""nonreligious;"" however it is more so, laden with post modernistic views of Christianity. I have no idea why some Christian recommended this book to my wife. The book out rightly overlooks the fact of God's Law and Grace."
3,If You Prefer Autobiography to Poses...,"The first few essays in ""Blue Like Jazz""--about growing up without a father, or the author's relationship with his mother--come across as almost artful. Though the point of his essay about buying his mother a crummy Christmas present is that no one knew they were eating with Hitler, and this is way over-stated, I do appreciate Miller's attempts to situate his spiritual insights in story.The problems really start for me when Miller stops doing this (a little less than half-way through the book). When he drops the narrative in favor of banal dialogues with Tony the Beat Poet, who is neither a Beat nor a Poet, the book loses its interest and, paradoxically, its ""authenticity."" Aside from the account of setting up a ""confession booth"" on the Reed campus where non-believers can go in and hear a Christian repent of the historic church's crimes against humanity, the book loses its focus and does not deliver on its initial promise."
4,All That Jazz,"While some have taken Miller to task for being too conversational or too sentimental, this book is perfect for the lapsed or the curious. Engaging and funny, Don Miller does not try to examine the deep philsophical underpinnings of Christianity. He expresses truth through experience, subtly encouraging the reader to do the same.P.S. The book isn't really about jazz. I was disappointed, but not so much that I was unable to enjoy it despite its title."
4,blue like jazz,"Book is worth reading if you can relate to the perspective of an unmarried American male raised and steeped in a conservative Protestant background. As open minded as the author wants and tries to be as he presents his experiences and views, his background rounds off his vision as sometimes myopic. The book presents an interesting but limited perspective since other spiritual views, such asHinduism and Buddhism, to name just two alternatives, can be just as ""jazzy."""
4,Great Read!,"A great read. I live in a very conservative red state with quite naturally, has very conservative congregations. I've given this book to several liberal, seeking friends. It is thoughts about God from a liberal's viewpoint. I think this is so important when trying to share the Gospel with someone who has never voted anything but Democrat. One of their obstacles is the political bent of 90% (in their eyes) of the Christians they meet. And even if you are as conservative as I am, Miller writes with an honesty and creativity that makes the book really enjoyable and memorable."
4,"Polar opposite of every right-wing conservative teacher, but he speaks from his heart","Don Miller writes as if he's sitting next to you at the dinner table, or on the stool next to you at a bar. He talks about Faith, and Church, and Community, and Money, and Worship, and Love, and so much more. He is the polar opposite of every right-wing conservative teacher, but he speaks from his heart and tells it like he sees it. Wonderful! Wonderful!"
3,"Very drawn out, but very good w/ word pictures!","Ordered this as an assignment. Very drawn out, but very good w/ word pictures!"
5,Amazing book!,"After reading this I felt released from living under the heavy burden of ""have to's"". This book reminded me that when I became a Christian, I didn't sign up to live my life pressed tightly into the mold we're so often told we need to fit into to be a ""good"" Christian.This book reminded me that when I accepted Christ, I made a commitment to follow HIM. And Jesus doesn't press us into molds, forcing us to become just like everyone else. If we let Him, He'll lead us toward who we were born to be- completely unique and completely His. Christianity is LIBERATING and I forgot that for a while... this book helped me remember."
5,Rebirth,"I won't say that this an album for everyone, but for B5 fans it's essential. Franke's music ties with the series in such a way that the truly dedicated can relive the show through the music and this, Sheridan's final hour is something worth reliving. Franke's soundtrack takes us back and it is as if it's happening all over again. That was probably redundant, but any B5 fan needs this album."
3,Several things annoyed me with Panasonic,"First the negatives: This unit advertised a free car kit and also rechargeable batteries. NOT! The coupon in the box for the kit was ALREADY EXPIRED (nice to see AMAZON sells the latest merchandise-I'm sure they got last years model at a great discount from Panasonic & passed the savings on to us (Yeah right! ) I called Panasonic & bitched-they finally agreed to sent me the kit- I'M STILL WAITING (2 MO.) You also need to use their SPECIAL rechargeable batteries @ $20- After A BIGGG hassle I finally tracked down where to get them...OUT OF STOCK... NOW the positives: so far so good- no problems with the electronics- didn't skip once: running, stair master, cycling.. tone quality is good... the belt looks cheesy (foam rubber for the anti-shock system) I'm sure it won't hold up (I'm sure Panasonic will sell you a new one for $50 and deliver it to you by next summer...)"
1,DO NOT BUY IT PLEASE BUY CLASSIC,SHOCKWAVE MORE LIKE SKIPALOTWAVE IT'S JUST BAD BUY THE ONE FOR 19.88 THE GPX YA
3,Classic Drew's CD,"Not sure why they don't list it as such, but this is a Drew's Famous Party Music CD. Of course, this means, not the original artists. Not a bad compilation, but if you're looking for original artists, this isn't it.A few interesting mixes ... for the money, it was worth it for me."
2,Vintage Footage,"I was expecting some modern footage but the cover is misleading, there arent even any jet fighters. The film only covers from post WWII to the fifties, there wasnt any 80's, 90's, 00's or even any 70's footage. Its all black and white or colorized and goes on about the experimental studies and effects of nuclear explosions. This is something you can watch for free on you tube or at the library. I gave it an extra star because it does show vintage footage of interest to people and coverage."
4,Speaking Up!,"Speak up with Confidence is just what my instructor ordered for our Christian Rhetoric class. After reading this book you will be glad to speak in front of any audience because you will know how and what to speak on. Speaking is more than just getting up to the podium and talking. You have to know your audience, know how to capture them, keep them and give them something to chew on later. I enjoyed reading this book and strongly suggest it to speakers from all walks of life. A person doesn't have to be from Harvard or Yale to speak in front of others. This book is for the intelligent as well as the silly. Somewhere in this book you will be able to relate to Carol Kent. This is also a good book for Pastors and their ministers."
4,Very helpful,Thank you for offering this book as an ebook. It was helpful to me as an occasional speaker and very enjoyable.
3,Difficult to read,This is the second Carol Kent book I have purchased and find that the print ink is much too light making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read.
4,Great album,"Only 5 of the tracks are actual songs, but of those 5, I could listen to four on repeat for an hour. I definitely recommend it to any Modest Mouse fan branching out past Moon and Antarctica and This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing to Think About."
4,"Short, but great stuff.","I was a little disappointed at how short this was, but it's still got some great material. The songs are very catchy and well written. I got this one after my friend gave me The Moon and Antarctica. I'd recommend that and this album if you like Modest Mouse."
3,Modest expectations met,"If one is inclined towards the scrappy synergy this indie rock act puts out, TFTAI will be a no-brainer addition, but for those not entirely converted to these soft squealers, this abbreviated entry would not be the best starting point."
3,Not their best,"There are two great songs on this EP: ""Summer"" and ""Sunspots"", the rest are examples of MM's ability to take a sketchy idea and stretch it out for far too long. Check out any of their albums for better songwriting, even Interstate 8 (reprised on Building Something out of Nothing) is a better example of the Modest Mouse sound."
2,save your money,I am a fan of modest mouse at least most of there stuff I didn't like long drive loved moon and antartic and thought lonesome crowded west was good this one however has only one good song to offer the fruit that ate itself is a great song well worth downloading better than any song on long drive or lonesome crowded west but the rest of the cd is garbage so save your money and download that one song.
4,X and Ja,"to that dude who said ja came out before X your wrong. X first came out 1992 and had a deal with columbia but they didn't want to work with him too much cause they wern't sure about him. so X fleft and then hooked up with defjam and ruff ryders and put out his first album. And X and Ja don't sound that similar, they both have corse voices."
3,Venni Vetti Vecci,"This cd has some real high points and then the rest is just plain average...Ja sounds a little like DMX but he doesnt sound like a complete copy, actually he's pretty good. Of course ""Holla Holla"" is just the best song on the album, with the catchy chorus and banging beat it was the summer jam of last year!Everyone heard it.I love the song Murda 4 Life w/Memphis Bleek second best, it has a spaced out beat and Ja & Bleek rap tight together. The other good tracks on here are ""Let's Ride"" ""We Here Now"" ""Race Against Time"" & ""It's Murda w/DMX & Jay-Z"" other then that it's pretty average or subpar beats which make the album pretty average overall."
4,A mix of the best,"Ja Rule is a mixture of the best on the hip-hop scene, hands down. Who is the best, you might ask? In my view it is the late Tupac Shakur & The Notorious B.I.G. Ja has the fantastic word craftsmanship of Tupac, and the unique delivery of the Notorious one. With that combination how can you not be the best? Ja-Rule is the answer to rhyme skills,in the absence of Tupac & Big, just as Allan Iverson is the answer in the absence of Michael Jordan to basket ball."
5,Where is the ....Real Ja Rule,"Ja Rule use to be the type of MC that showed hunger and passion. Kinda like well.....sorry to say...Tupac. Ja's debut album is the best project of his career. No it didn't sell like the follow-ups but hip hop is more relevant on Venni Vetti Vecci. The lead single ""Holla"" got our mouths wet...Ja Rule came correct on ""Story to Tell"" and the Murda Inc. track featuring then possible group members Jay-z and DMX. Eric Sermon also stops by for a guest appearance. Believe me...this album has tight beats and rhymes....go cop it now...."
1,YOU THINK UR BETTER THEN PAC,"IF PAC WAS STILL ALIVE WHERE WOULD YOU BE, WHAT WOULD U BE DOIN NOW.DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE RIDIN WITH PAC.ONE MINUTE YOUR A HARDCORE RAPPER WITH GREAT SONGS LIKE HOLLA HOLLA AND NOW YOU HAVE TURNED INTO A POP STAR SINGING S*** P***Y SONGS WITH ASHANTI AND JLO AND YOU CANNOT JUST TURN BACK INTO A RAPPER LIKE THAT, NO WONDER WHY 50 AND EM HAVE GOT beef with you.if you want a good hardcore gangster rap album i sugest you get all eyes on me by 2pac even if you re not a 2 pac fan!!!!!!!"
1,You've Gotta Be Kidding Me,"Ja Rules best work sounds like Chingy's worst work. Well yeah Chingy is crap as well but at least he doesn't lie to everyone and steal Pac's words and try to act like him. Ja, stop thinking that Pac would roll with you. If Pac was still here he'd diss you, oh no wait. If Pac was still here you wouldn't even be in the game so shut up.It's no wonder 50 disses you so much. And stop talking like your so gangsta, Everyone outside your blind legion of fans knows that your a fake. How dare people have the nerve to call this rubbish straight hip hop.

1,Ja Rules fans are dumb as hell! READ THIS,Yo i hate when people like ja dont speak the truth. He talks about all this (...) like he went through it but hes just lying. He's a WANKSTA and im not sayin that cause i support 50 cause i hate 50. But hes got a point when he talks about ja. If your a ja fan you are being lied to and wasting your money when your supporting a true wanksta. Yo ja stop stealing Pac's words if he were alive he would never role wit you. If you want to be lied to and hear the most annoying voice and waste your money by this album or other ja albums.
5,what the hell happened!!,"Ok what the hell happened, this album is so good, Ja rules debut album is his only good cd, well its better than good, this album does not really have any song u can skip past, now we all know how tight holla holla is, but there are other great tracks on there like kill em all, ja really murders this tune with some superb rapping skills, then u got ni''az theme which is an awsome track, u got hardcore traks like tghe murderas which is truly great, other great tracks are murda 4 life , e-dub and ja, this album shows that ja has talent, he needs to get back to this style aand leave the pop industry alone, stop making tracks with rnb chicks and stop sampling 2pac, if ja brings out another album like this then he willget back the respect he has lost, come on jau got da talent."
4,What happened?,"Oh, man... this CD is Ja Rule at his best. Let's see... Let's Ride has a nice west coast feel, very nice work here. Two of my favorite songs are ""Suicide Freestyle"" with Case (wow is the only word I have) and ""Only Begotten Son (the intro gives up a hint at Rule 3:36). That song is very deep, hitting hard on every level. The collabo with Jigga and X is tight also... I hope these three team up again. I don't know why Ja Rule went the way he did, but I promise you'll like this CD. Ja Rule is at his best... his lyrics are tight, and the beats match his style well. Pick this up... you won't be disappointed."
5,The Music Explains The Rating,"Honestly I can't even explain how good this cd is. Definately Ja Rule at his best. ""Holla Holla"" and ""The Murderers"" alone give it a 2 1/2 star rating. If your gonna go out and buy ""Rule 3:36"" or ""Pain Is Love"" don't. You wanna get this cd first. The rest the music can tell you. That a wrap! PEACE OUT!!!"
5,"Without a Doubt, Ja's Best Album","The whole album runs with a gritty sound. Before ""Rule 3:36""(his last good album), and the horrible ""Pain is Love,"" he came out with this. It also has the best song from Ja to date, ""Story to Tell"" from the Belly soundtrack. Get Rule 3:36 and Venni Vetti Vicci. That's all you need."
3,RE: Could of done better. yet impressive,"This album is highly overrated. I love the beats on the album and the title is hot. The beats are hot to def and Ja-Rule's voice is catchy. Ja has a raspy voice and his choruses are also catchy. Most fans would recite with his chorus and that's good. However, he is one dimensional. Ja speaks about one thing throughout majority of the album and it's murda. Only four tracks are talking about something else. Ja album could have done better. The only reason for the hype is because of DMX and Jay-Z. The album would have done better if he had diversed topics and in this album it show very little. Not everybody want to hear thug, rough music all the time."
2,DEVASTATINGLY TERRIBLE!!!!,"I bought this cd cuz I liked JA's flow in ""You are Everything"" w/ Dru Hill. ""Holla Holla"" was pretty good, but the cd sucked. All the songs sound the same and the beats are weak. The songs w/JayZ and DMX are ok. Irv Gotti is a terrible producer. They shouda gotten Swizz Beatz. If you want a GOOD Hip-Hop cd, pick up Snoop's new cd ""Top Dogg."""
4,Ja Rule - Venni Vetti Vicci,"Ok....this dude below me is a silly bastard, and probably doesn't know real music from a severed leg. This album is dopeness, not even close to one of the best of all time, but by far Ja's best album, and definitely a favorite of 1998. To even try and compare Ja Rule to 2pac should be a crime against humanity, and to say that 2pac only had one good song...well, you should be poked with a burning stick for that one. Anywho, I recommend this album for anyone who has an eye and ear for good music, spiritual growth, and solid lyricism with a healthy mix of club jams and gangster rap gunplay. Not particularly my style of music anymore, but definitely one of the best in its category. Peace."
5,A True Diamond In the Rough,"Ja Rule's VENNI VETTI VECCI is just one of those CD's that comes along every once in a while and completely changes your whole perspective. In some of the more hard-core tracks, such as ""We Here Now"" and ""The Murderers,"" Ja simply epitomizes gangsta rap, reminding you why you started listening to the genre with some clever hooks and pumping electronic beats. Then, in exceptionally heartfelt tracks such as ""Daddy's Little Baby,"" Ja Rule's hip-hop ballad to his daughter, the CD glows with emotion and moves the listener almost to the point of tears, showing us that in every thug beats a heart of gold. The most excellent song on the CD, ""Only Begotten Son,"" shows Ja Rule using the full spectrum of emotions to express his sorrow and anger for his father's abandonment, and has quickly become my favorite rap song of all time. This CD is a true gem, which no rap fan should pass up."
5,its a D@%N good CD if you ask me,Ja RUle is fulla nasty beets and slammin lyrics. its a must buy for someone who likes there bass deep and hard hitting
5,tis da s*,"This cd is the one cd i can actully relate to, his lyircs you can tell aren't fake, but from the heart. Plus most of the beats on there get you pumped and ready to go,the best i think is, Lets Ride, Holla Holla, Only Begotton Son, but if you lookin for some good beats buy this Cd now, BET!!!"
4,Go To #16 right away,#16 on this album is the best song of all time: Murda 4 Life (featuring Memphis Bleak)
5,This is one CD you got's to have the beats are slammin'.,"Hands down its the best combination of various styles and moods in the same CD I've ever heard. He's got some tracks you can get up and dance to, others you boob ya head to and also those that you just wanna sit back, relax and listen to and understand. I got my money's worth. Definitely."
5,"A Jigga who is in2 hip-hop,been listenin since da 90's","A yo ppl,dis cd right chea is off da hook 4 real,If u dont have it then get it,if u put off buyin it,theres somethin wrong wit u,dis is a definite go get,u wont be sorry,dont believe me,if u see me in da chat rooms,holla at me ill give u da 411 on it,well im out but do go and get this cd,peace"
5,Ja Rule tearz it up 4 Queenz,"Dis sh*t is mad ill. He sounds mad lot like da great DMX and nobody can ever be better than X, but Ja Rule comes close. I can't wait till Murda INC. comez out"
4,One of the best,This album is one of the best rap albums I have heard. All his lyrics go deep and his songs have good beats.
1,This album is not fresh,"The tracks that are supposed to be good are just close forgeries of other popular songs. For instance, track 2 is just like victory from Puff. You hear ""THE worlds most dangerous"" copying Busta and than what could be worse than listening to countless tracks glamorizing murder. The music is rough, but uninteresting. Holla, Holla is the only song worth listening to. The dismalness of the album can only be cured by listening to something tight. Try Jamboree by Naughty by Nature. Right now I am thinking about how I can take this album back. Out!"
2,I blew you up and I was let down!,Man you wanna be! After your single Holla Holla came out I told every one you was going to come out hard and on top. I think I was the only one from the ville to buy yo shit! Thanks Alot Get some damn beats All people who sweated this cd needs some music help!
2,A poor CD in my opinion.,"Ja Rule is a good rapper, he has got good style whether he be rapping or singin he is good but this cd isn't very good. Maybe the explicit version is a lot better but Ja Rule, DMX and the other artists that feature all use explicit language too much. So if you are gonna get this cd get the other version! Or pick up his newest lp ""Rule 3:36"" for some cool party tunes!"
5,its murda incorporated,"I can't say enough good things about Ja Rule, he is got to be one of the hardest rappers out there, and his cuts remind me of how I live my life. All of the cuts are tight, but ""Its Murda"" sticks out the most, I put that on repeat so many times. Like DMX though, he kinda got caught up in fame for his 2nd joint and I hope that he'll go back to his old style thats on Venni Vitti Veccipeace"
1,This is tight but i give it a one start,I give it one start b/c he wants to copy dmx to much don't get me wrong this cd is blazin' but i don't like him copying dmx style. remeber go buy 2pac he has the best rymes u will ever hear
1,Ja Rule Ja sucks,"Just from looking on the back, you can see how much time Ja put into the conception of this album, and get an idea the level of creativity you can expect. From ""Let's Ride"" to ""Bitch Betta Have My Money,"" you know you're in for something new, right? And with astounding titles like ""Kill Em All,"" ""It's Murda,"" and my favorite ""Murda 4 Life,"" shoot, that's creative... Lyrically, there are few artists from any part of the world who can match Ja Rule's complete lack of talent. Although Ja has the vocabulary of a first grader, he still manages to deliver lyrics that rival those of Dr. Suess. Ja also maintains that loveable charm of a child who's just learned his first curse word, and can't seem to find anything else worth saying."
4,"Ja Rule's CD Is Very Tight, Y'all!","This Cd by Ja of the Murda Trio of him, DMX, and Jigga has a stunning pressence. It's not the greatest CD i've ever heard, but by next time Ja will have a classic. Still a very good cd, though. Check out numbers 3, 5, 13, 16, 18, 19, and 20 on the CD!!! Very Tight!!!!"
1,i hate commercialized 'rap' music!,"i really don't enjoy listening to stuff played out on radio, and all of this commercialized, mainstream, watered down, talking about how they're all hard thug junk. i support the underground world of hip-hop, where the real MCs is at. if you want to listen to REAL hip hop music, peep the artists at RAWKUS, or the native tongues, the roots, common, duck down, etc. BUT NOT THIS STUFF! these guys got nothin' new to talk about."
5,THE BOMB,"THIS CD IS A VERY DIVERSIFIED CD.JA RULE GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT EVERYTHING,FROM THE HARDCORE GANSTA TO A MELLO LADY'S MAN.THIS CD MAKES YOUR HEAD NOD."
3,Ehhhhhh?!?!?!?!?!,"Hmmmm let's see, to basically sum this album up without writing a massive review..Solid ProductionTerrible lyrics/flowJa rule should just give up and start up a golf club or something, because rap definetly isn't Ja's place."
3,It's Alright,"At first I didnt like Ja because he seemed like he took too much of Pac's style. But his album is bumbing, 8,9,13-20 is a banging. Check it out. Also DMX is on it and the song is with Jay-Z and is one of the best #13."
3,a descent overall listen but 2 commercial sounding,"its a descent cd like every other commercial rapper. theres flashes of brilliance along with some songs where u just wonder ""y put this on a cd the whole world will here?"" after a few songs u get maaad tired of hearin ""its murda"". irv gotti produces sum hot joints and ja hits ya wit sum catchy hooks here n there. overall, it aint bad but its mad inconsistent."
1,Waste of $$,This is just another poor hip-hop/rap attempt created by MTV. It's the same as all the others just it's just got a new name. This one will fade out soon like so many of the others. Save your cash buy something by someone with some talent.
3,Disapointment,"That Venni Vetti Vecci joint? Its aight, Its aight, but you want John Blaze ish. I got John Blaze."
2,not good,i am not a huge fan of ja rule.i am a huge fan of 50 cent doe.get dat cuz dats bangin or da cradle 2 the grave soundtrack.but dont get bad boyz soundtrack doe ok playa.i also wouldent get any more ja rule cds because dey r just as bad or worse.thatz my word.
2,"A WANNA BE DMX, BUT I CAN'T GIVE HIM THAT MUCH PROPS!!!!!","I feel his song ""Holla!Holla!"" was good but all I could think about was is he trying to copy DMX style and flow of texture. He needs to get his own style as well as his own singing tone because it sucks to hear a copy cat!!! What a busta!!!"
1,Ja Rule is a poor man's DMX,This album is horrible. It's all over the place. There's no coherence. The music is overproduced and sample heavy. Ja Rule's lyrics are inane and laughable. This album should be canned. Not recommended.
1,HOLLA HOLLA IF U WANNA WASTE 12 DOLLERS,"THIS IS A WACK ALBUM, HOW COULD SOMEONE POSSIBLY BASE THEIR STYLE ON THE WACKEST RHYMER EVER DMX. DMX SUCKS SO DOES HIS POOR IMMITATER, KURUPT SUMMED IT UP IN HIS JOINT CALLIN OUT NAMES. IF U WANNA HEAR SOME REAL HIP HOP CHECK DRE, EMINEM DOPE HIP HOP."
2,Not exactly what I expected,"Ja Rule is a very talented artist there is no doubt about that, however this album for me was a little bit of a disapointment.I just didn't really like it that much. Keep in mind that I am not the biggest rap fan in the world but when I heard the song holla holla I loved it so I ordered this album through my cd club and it turnes out that holla holla is the only song that I actually really listen too."
4,The Beats Are Slammin,This Album has the beats that will make you you go crazy. Lyrically Jarule is just ok. Guest appearances from Jay-z and dmx help make this album almost a classic. This Album is not a classic but it is not to far from one.
5,Best summer shoe ever!,"I love this shoes, best summer shoe ever. they do not pinch you and are sexy!+ coffi!"
4,Cheaper at DSW,"This is a great shoe, but I found it in two colors at the DSW Shoes in my area for $79.95. You might want to try there first."
2,Not durable at all.,"I had only two bucks in my account so i bought this. I broke it 5 minutes after i got it. and shipping was ""okay"". You get what you pay for."
2,Extremely delicate,"I got this as a prop for a play and actually bought two because many of the reviews talked about them breaking. My first one broke during the first rehearsal, and the second one broke during the second rehearsal. And we were trying to be careful with them. I'd hoped that we could get a few uses out of it, despite the bad reviews, but I was wrong. Try to find something else, if you can. Or plan on reinforcing it."
1,the toy that breaks when you look at it!,"This product lasted all of 10 minutes. I actually bought two just in case one did break and neither lasted more than 10 minutes. Really, you look at these things and they break. Very poor quality materials. I was very disappointed by the product, but they were very inexpencive and you get what you pay for."
1,JUNK,"This broke less than 24 hours after opening and we were not rough with it at all. Terrible. The seller was very fast to ship though.....product just was awful, in this case anyway."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! :(,WORST KNIFE EVER IT BROKE AS SOON AS I TOOK IT OUT OF ITS CASE. THIS IS GARBAGE DO NOT BUY THIS. WASTE OF MONEY. WASTE OF MONEY.
3,Cheap but Not Horrible,"I ordered this product for a film I was making. It lasted through most of the rehearsal, but broke when we were doing some of the final shots. The knife is so inexpensive, though, that I think you might as well just buy 3 or 4 and replace them as they break. Overall, it gets the job done - if it were any more expensive I'd say don't buy, but it isn't so it's probably the best value for your money (if you're careful)."
2,broke easily,But I know it was cheap so I guess I got what I paid for. I was just hoping it would last more than a few days.
2,Broke Within Ten Minutes of Opening,"My son merrily stabbed this trick knife for about ten minutes until I heard him shriek ""Stupid Dollar Store piece of crap!"" Thankfully, we did not lose the spring and were able to Duck tape it together. Very junky, but still a fair add-on item for free shipping."
2,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"What did I expect when purchasing this item at the price I bought them for? Exactly what I got, but I figured they wouldn't break getting them out of the package. I used super glue and tape, but the spring gets stuck on something on the inside as well and quits working, but if you squeeze on the handle from the side, then that will reset the spring and it will work again for a few. I bought two for each of my boys and they do have fun with them until they mess up again and then I fix them. If you don't wan't to hassle with repairing all the time then I would pass."
2,It sucks,It looks soo fake i hate it i should have noy bought it it sucks dont get it people no kid not worth it.
1,Broke an hour after receipt,Pure junk.. don't waste your money. My son was excited to receive this gift and it broke an hour after use. He is 15 and was careful with it and it just plain busted.
3,"OK, NOT GREAT","This toy is fun and a great prop. It works fine, although if you bang it around enough it will break. The blade is fairly realistic, what you'd expect for 3 bucks. I do suggest just buying it at a store, it will cost less since it does not have to be shipped and you don't have to wait. Besides, with halloween coming up, you can find one at almost any store."
5,Multiplication Unplugged by Sara Jordan,"My 4th grade daughter absolutely loves this CD! This CD is such a valuable learning tool and it reinforces the times tables. I highly recommend this as well as the other Sara Jordan CDs, i.e.; Division Unplugged, Additional Unplugged and Subtraction Unplugged.... WE HAVE THEM ALL!"
1,Boring!,"I bought this along with the division, addition, and subtraction for my 8 and 5 year olds and they are all so boring. Yes the information on them is good but useless if your kids can't stand listening to it. The songs are so long and there's no rythm to make the songs catchy or fun. I understand that different people like different types of music. If your kids tend to like pop music like you hear on the radio then they will not like this."
1,8 year-old Daughter hated it,My 8 year-old daughter hated the music and wouldn't listen to it. I'd put it in the CD player anyway. She disliked it so much that she took it out of the car and hid it! I was hopeful that this would work.
1,Multiplication help,The music is not at all appealing in this disc. I feel that I wasted my money on multiplication unplugged.
2,Not as good as I hoped...,My daughter lost interest in this quickly. I had hoped with all the good reveiws that I would have been happy with it. She is always playing music and singing songs but it just didn't catch her attention.
1,Oy! Turn it off!!,"Don't get me wrong -- I'd take a bullet for my kid without hesitating. But I cannot listen to this CD. I lived through five years of Raffi and his ilk without any difficulty, but this CD is so sickly-sweet and precious that no self-respecting four year old would listen to it. Honest! I tried several times to listen to this, telling myself it is a good format, presents the material really well, and no one is rapping. I tried. Really I did. But I failed. I cannot subject myself to this CD. Save yourself while you still can!"
2,Great concept but the tunes need work.,"This is such a great concept, but the tunes on this cd are boring and not catchy. Multiplication by heart is much better and has tunes that we have heard before and that you will find yourself singing often."
2,Not for kids over the age of 6!,"This CD may be OK for younger kids whose parents want to get a head start on times tables, but even that may be a stretch! Had there been an option to listen to tidbits of each track before you buy it, I wouldn't have wasted my money. The songs are very preschool age cheesy, and I didn't feel that they were a good educational tool. I obviously had to open the CD package to learn all of this, so I can't return it to Amazon. Ebay here it comes!"
1,Just Awful,"I bought this for my 9 yr old b/c she was having trouble committing multiplication tables to memory. We put it on in the car and even I couldn't bear to listen to it. There is no rhyme or repetition to these ""songs"". I'm a teacher and I was hoping to use them with my class, but I wouldn't dare put them through the agony of listening to this. Just a waste of money."
4,"simple, yet effective","My 8 year old daughter just couldn't seem to memorize her tables. Some of the reviews of this cd were a bit discouraging, but I decided to give it a try since my child loves music. I agree that the songs are a bit sappy, but I have my daughter listen to it nightly and after 2 weeks, she is singing all of her tables. For my child, music is a great learning tool. I have also just purchased the other cd's (addition, subtraction and division unplugged) in hopes they may help her master her facts without all the frustration of timed drills/flash cards."
3,Interesting book,Had to read the book for school and it was quite interesting and a cool way to explain the different aspects of systems thinking.
1,Learn When Not To Order,"A lot of blank space, cartoon drawings and scant, obvious text make this book a poor choice for any learning organization."
3,beautiful but my foot hurts,"i pre treated with crazy glue the sparkles to not lose them, and then run, walk and travel by bus with a toddler..everything was perfect...but this morning my foot hurts...iin my arch so i really need my sneakers!though they are so beautiful!!!i'll wear them again but for small walks"
4,Cracking the ACT,Bought this book for my daughter and it helped her prepare for the test. I srtongly believe it got her and extra 3-5 points on the test.
3,need more practice!!!,"this book had some good ideas, but some, like its methods for taking the writing and reading sections were silly. very silly. also, it definately didnot provide enough practice problems/tests to actually practice using the techniques to ace the act. if i could go back in the past, i definately wouldn't buy this book again. i think from now on, i'll stick with kaplan."
2,broken,"The camera has a glitch, it changes the type of picture randomly and the only way to correct it is turning it off and then on again.I took it to the repair center and they don't know if they will be able to fix it."
3,"not bad, expected better","I got this cd without knowing much about the band but with high expectations. It isn't bad, but it sounds kinda forced to me. But, what do I know?It'll go in my ""listen to once every couple of months"" pile."
5,"Amazing, life changing movie!","This movie changed gave a new perspective on life, in this very moving story. Highly recommended for anyone dealing with the issues in hand, or intolerance, especially religious intolerance."
5,Awesome movie!,Great movie! wish that all parents that had gay children would watch it cause it really opens your eyes to the suffering that they go through! I loved this movie and hope others will watch it and that it opens their eyes to the hell that gay people go through!
5,Wow! I never cry at movies and this one got me.,"I felt like the movie was a biography of my life. It captures the sentiment of a young gay person struggling with a homophobic family so perfectly. The way he wants to die, the anguish and guilt the mom suffers, how she changes her views once she understands... It was just incredible. Great, great, great movie! (I don't like including politics in my reviews but it's a perfect reflection of the pain and suffering that the Evangelical Christian Right causes on young gay men and women who feel hopeless and discontent in this country.)"
3,easy to get lost,There is a lot of story and events from the original Zeta series to ram into a three movie trilogy. I can't say that was done well in this series. I was totally lost in the first movie. Its important that you either read the story in advance before you watch the movie or invest the hours into watching the original series. The new animation is quite nice. The first movie is almost all put together with original footage but the last two videos are mostly new animation. Not having the English dub is quite annoying. You practically miss all the new animation because there is so much text to read and you need to keep up with it or get lost with the story.
4,"Stop complaining about ""Japanese dubs""...sheesh","This movie trilogy is awesome, I saw it when it originally came out in 2005-06. Unfortunately since it was all Japanese with no subtitles I couldn't understand the whole thing (especially the new scenes). That being said, when it comes to anime, I prefer subtitles over poor quality dubbing. Something just seems to be lost in the emotions conveyed by the characters when it comes to english dubs, especially when the english voices themselves are generic and emotionless. Instead of complaining, just be happy it's finally released here in the U.S. 5 years later after the original release. If it bothers you that much, don't watch it."
3,Basic review,"Each DVD in this package is a therater release of a reproduction of Z Gundam's 50 episodes. It use some of the old scene from the TV episodes and mixed with new CG scene. The only thing that annoys me is the Japanese dub. I was hoping that it has the English sub title. Also, the old closing music theme is being replaced."
2,Another failed GUNDAM release -- what is Bandai thinking?,"It is well documented and established that in the US, English-dubbed anime outsells non-dubbed by at least three or four times. So why does Bandai continue to dump their old GUNDAM material on the US market without dubs (they did the same thing with the original MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM movies on DVD)? The dubs clearly exist [they are available on VHS] so they are only shooting themselves in the foot by not releasing them. How do they expect to attract a new (younger) audience by releasing them in a form that will not sell? (My kids unfortunately won't watch anything in black & white or not dubbed). Note that this short-sighted action is equivalent to releasing DVDs of old TV series and then stripping out all of the original music but without the excuse of ""not being able to release the music due to excessive royalty costs (examps- WKRP IN CINCINATTI, THE FUGITIVE, etc"". People won't buy them because they ""are not what they remember seeing""."
4,Enjoy the Game by Visionaire's vision!,"Visionaire No.30 is my favorite item, the best of visionaire. This is the collaboration of Louis Vuitton Cup and Louis Vuitton, Visionaire. There are 7 version in 7 different country. We can enjoy 42 different vision by cubes puzzle. (6 different vision by 16 cubes puzzle each one country) . This is Australia version. Of course, there are contained a vision imaged by Australian beautiful sea and sky. And box designed by Louis Vuitton is very cute! That is very beautiful and wonderful!!This is nice commemoration in A.D.2000!"
4,Keeping their Memory Alive,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book with regard to the female agents of the Special Operations Executive; if anything, I did not want it to end but be more detailed. For someone who is beginning research into the subject, it is an excellent source to begin for some of the top agent names and leads via the sources / bibliography. Other famous agents such as Odette Sanson or Nancy Wake aka the White Mouse are not covered, but one of the most famous and well known agents, Violette Szabo is covered by a chapter. Other books to recommend would be We Landed by Moonlight by a top SOE pilot Hugh Verity,SOE in France by M.R.D. Foot,and Between Silk and Cyanide; Leo Marks.The sacrifices made by these brave individuals should never be forgotten."
1,Only useful for the bibliography,"Plodding, lifeless, and entirely too little time is spent on the women it's purported to be about. I spent most of each chapter wading through pages and pages about the men that surrounded these women, with very little detail spent on the women--and when there was detail, it was often couched in rather grating ""gosh, these pretty little gals and their spying"" language that made it insulting to read."
4,excellent,"An alternative version of the Great Gatsby with the essence of a Saint Exupery so cleverly captured in creating the characters of the ""Toads"". Be prepared to rethink a whole journey of themes closest to the human heart like love,death and God in a whole new dimension!"
4,Another Greene Gem,"Like the much overlooked, ""The Tenth Man,"" this short novel is a great fun read, with well-drawn characters who move through an interesting plot. Bought it in the dust bin of a local thrift store for a dollar. What a bargain! Greene's writing is exquisite and I am thankful to have finally found him."
4,Eerie and Addictive,This psychologically blasé look at an insane and mercilessly cruel tycoon is quietly some of the legendary writer's best work. What a shame that one of Greene's fabulous shorter books has been out of print. Find it!
5,Greenely Fischey,"Reading Greene is like ecounting the color green on a traffic light; you go on.What collided with me mostly is how this book is an utter antonym to its own being.It is ever so sweetly acerb!A ""Giullare"" that teases and pleads the reader at the same time."
4,no regrets,"this is the cd player for anyone who wants to buy it once and for all. Other than one or two drawbacks, like the flimsy slot oppener which, although it gives me no problem, will accidentally activate if you handle the product vigorously; or the top buttons which you cannot squeeze it in a tight space without touching, the product is perfectly functional,with very economical use of battery life and sound that really lives up to promise."
2,Beware Audiobook Listeners.,"This is fine for listening to music cds, it has a good anti-shock feature that prevents skipping. The earphones that come with it are trash, the sound quality is horrible, I switched my sony earphones on it and it was a huge difference. I bought this specifically to listen to audiobooks. MISTAKE! Yes, it has a resume feature where it ""saves"" your place - kind of. Some players save your place in the exact spot where you left off. Not this model, it will only save your place at the beginning of the chapter you were on, so you have to listen to the whole chapter all over again if you were near the end. I am disappointed, not worth my $40!"
5,50+ Year Memory,"It has been almost fifty-five years since I read this book, and the hair on the back of my neck still stands up when I think of Johnny walking in the snow one night, unaware that the mountain lion is stalking him! I have, so far, 23 of Jim Kjelgaard's books in my library, and now my grandson is just old enough to start reading them . . . and he, too, is captivated by this author's stories. Now that most, if not all, the titles are out of copyright, let's hope some publisher comes out with a set of twenty or thirty of this Dane's wonderful books."
3,Nobody Knows,Pretty good. Kept my interest considering I was so busy I had to keep putting it down but would go back to it to see how it ended.
3,Heats up food to fast,the only thing i like about this is it cooks food fast. bad thing is you have to watch your food . and the toaster gets very hot on the outside .
2,"Unsafe, Poorly designed, Eyesore","You get what you pay for. We use this at least once a day and within the first two weeks, we noticed several problems.The tray does not come in and out easily, it gets stuck and you have to use something to pull out the tray b/c the meal rack is too hot.From my experience, food does not cook easily. Its hard to adjust the timer correctly and oftentimes, one side cooks more than others.The outside gets dangerously hot. Touching it with a bare hand would easily scald you.The vents on the side let out heat, which consequently creates dark streaks on the white metal that are hard to clean and very ugly. This toaster oven looked like it was 5 years old within the first month.I regret getting this crappy gift and will not use ""ToasterOven"" products anymore."
3,Good Basic Toaster Oven,"I received this toaster oven as a promotion gift. After reading the reviews on it I was hesitant to use it. I finally decided to try it out. It has become a favorite of mine. Some of the cons others have noted are true. The exterior does get hot, the tray will not hold four slices of normal sized bread, and opening the door does not turn off the heating element. I use a blue non-scratch nylon scrubber to clean the inside, outside and glass. After month's of use it still looks and works fine. Also, if you remove the grill the tray sits on, be sure to put it back in the grooves on the side. I didn't and had problems with the tray not sliding out properly until I noticed this. All in all, my experience has been good."
1,TOV320 4-Slice Toaster Oven Broiler,"I was trying to order the TOV200 with the SS insides that were easy to clean and the outside of the toaster stayed cool, but we got this instead. It was my own fault as the system made the switch while I was placing the order. It is ""buyer beware"" after all. One can't make everything perfect for stupid people. We will use it in the RV so it will be ok."
5,Take me back to my college days!,"When I was at college in the early 70's, I always loved the Moments, the Dells and the Originals. The Bells was and has always been one of my favorite love songs.To be loved to that level would be a blessing!"
5,Just what I wanted!,"I had been looking for music by the Originals for a long time. I was thrilled to get this CD! The price was right, it came quickly in the mail, and I LOVE it. Thank you!"
4,Decent case,"Nice for the price. A little flimsy. I wouldn't be tossing in it a tour bus/trailer, but for light use it sure beats a gig bag."
3,Good value but not great fit for tele,"I bought the tweed version. It's attractive and not as heavyas I expected. The construction quality appears to be prettygood, and latches also seem of decent quality. The paddinginside is fairly light but sufficient.My problem with this case is that it doesn't fit mytelecaster well. When the case is laid flat, thebody near the neck is slightly suspended because the neckholder in the case is a little too high. When the caseis held sideways in carrying position, the whole bodyslides down and the neck falls out of the neck holder.In short, the guitar is not supported as I'd like whenthe case is in its most usual positions.I wouldn't buy another of these cases for a telecaster.I'll see if I have another guitar that fits this casebetter, and look for another case for the tele.By the way, my case arrived with three small stainson the tweed (from about pea-sized to penny-sized)."
3,Tweed case,"This is a nice looking, reasonably well made case for the money. I bought it for a tele that I built. The only reason that I give it three stars and not four is because mine came with a fist size stain on the front. I suppose I could return it but that is just a pain. Since I plan on actually using it, I figure it will get dirty and stained anyway. Not sure how well it will hold up. I don't gig a lot and it has not left the house yet."
4,low fi low fuss,"Not quite as RAWK as LAL's other efforts, but worthy of a listen even so, if only for the obnoxiously great techno-dance-number-I-created-on-my-keyboard tune ""Uninvited Trumpets."" Every sound on this disc emerges through a hazy mist of guitar fuzz and drone. It's worth repeated listens and heightened concentration to make out the surprisingly good sing song lyrics."
5,Good boom for the buck,"This CD player is just what i wanted for [this] price range with some nice extra features. The car adaptors are nice and the 40 second ESP is a great deal. The player just won't skip with it on. The CD Wallet is a nice bonus, and the bass boost is great. There are no faults with the player, but the headphones are flimsy and don't hold up. You sould probably get a new pair before the old one breaks."
1,Big Disappointment,"I bought 2 of these units, one for myself and one for a friend. Mine was mainly for my car and it skips with the slightest bump. I was so disappointed, I'll never buy another one. My friends skips as well. My original Magnavox that I bought years ago was the best, unfortunately, through wear & tear, it no longer works."
1,the little CD player that couldn't,This CD player is extremely temperamental. It works well only on rare occasions. Spend the extra money...the frustration is not worth the price.
3,"' ""don't you worry about me."" She wiped her cheek with her hand. ""I'm going to have a lovely party.""","Edward, a married middle-aged accountant, decides to compensate his mistress Binny for spending so little time with her.'He denied her the simple pleasures a wife takes for granted- the business of cooking his meals, remembering his sister's birthday, putting intricate little bundles of socks in his drawer.'So he selects a broadminded couple of friends to attend a dinner party at Binny's. After she has offloaded her awful children, made an attempt at cooking dinner in her rather grotty kitchen and they have got over the initial awkwardness, things seem to be going OK.But events are about to take an unexpected turn...Quite a funny novel with many clever little observations on life and people."
5,"Great Read! Funny, Wonderful Characters","Amanda Scott has done it again. A great story. The hero's too-kind Aunt Marjory is hysterical. Everyone knows someone just like her. The plot is clever, and the author's ability to carry the reader right into late 16th century Scotland is truly amazing. I don't know what book that first reviewer read, but it can't have been this one. If you're looking for a page-turner, this is it!"
5,Mr Langstaff respect,"Yet another Revels album that is just absolutely wonderful.If you like traditional music and proper folk, click, order or whatever...support these talented people. PS. Revels come to the UK asap."
4,"The 5-star review is right on all counts, but . . .","One word of warning, at least about the CD version: it was clearly recorded in a large room, and it sounds like the recording equipment wasn't properly placed. This occasionally results in the performers sounding distant or ever-so-slightly muffled.Definitely worth the purchase, especially if you love the Revels -- this recording has a lot going for it. Just be aware that, at least on some transfers, the recording is less than stellar."
3,"""THE PIG""",I LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE ITS COOL. IT WAS FUN TO LISTEN TO. I LIKED HOW ALEX'S MOM ACTS IN THE BANK. I LIKED HOW THEY SET UP DEAN. MARTYN'S FAMILY HAS ALOT OF DRAMA AND IT AS EXITING TO READ BECAUSE U DIDNT KNOW WHAT WAS GOIN TO HAPPEN NEXT.I LIKED HOW ALEX'S AND MARTYN'S FRIENDSHIP GREW THREW THE FRIENDSHIP.I THINK MARTYN IS A PRETTY TALENTED TEENAGER.
3,Ali's Review,"I liked the book because I liked the action and the drama and suspense. I also like the book because I liked the way martyn and alex tried to set up dean, to make it look like dean killed martyns father william."
3,Alex,I liked that this book told a story that you didn't want to stop reading. I liked how the characters were described. I also found that I enjoyed how the story developed and how there were a lot of unexpected events happening. At the end of the book I liked the way it ended so you knew what the rest was but weren't completely sure.
3,More Martyn please!!!!!,"There is lots of suspense. It keeps you guessing till the end. Some parts of the novel will leave you at the edge of your seat, craving for more of the story. The book is clever and character's actions will surprise you. Great detail in the story!"
3,*^~> MaRtYn PiG <^~*,it was good at the begginging of the story. i didnt even want to stop the teacher from readng it but we didnt have any time to keep on going because we were reading it in the library and we only had that class for 40min. the middle of the story was good too but after a while it started to get boring at the end of the story.
3,first hand view,I thought that this story was ok at some parts it was kinda boring and i was practically falling asleep. Although at other parts it can keep you on the edge of your seat so you just can't wait to see what happens. This story has so many twists and turns to keep you guessing from begining to end. Noone can predicate what happens in this story until they read it. I give it three stars because you really have to pay attention during the story other wise you won't understand the ending.
2,Martyn Pig commentary,I hated this story.Come on now this story is weak man. He has a dad that drinks all the time compared to most drukens this guy is sober. When he becoems arosed he sould be less self reserved.
3,mARTYN pIG,"HI THIS IS NATALIA!!!!!What was interesting about this book is that it had some scarry parts and shocking but not much. I didnt like the book because it didnt have any excitment or fun and what i know about this book is that the kid Martyn Pig killed his own father and because he was an alchoholic. I think it is because maybe he didnt like him. Martin was a good student and he also had good grades.When the police came, the kid did not tell the truth about what happened to his father because he scared that they might throw him in jail and he was afraid to admitted and he told the police that he went out some where and he will not come back for awhile. What happened is Martyn pushed his father of the stairs and he is dead. Martyn didnt feel anything good about his father because he was always mean to him or didnt even have fun with his own kid or didnt worry about anything if he works good in school. Martyn is alone without family and sad"
3,The Book I Never Read,"I never really read this book before.So ill try to summerize it as well as i can.I found this book kinda good, but pretty darn confusing, as in matter of fact I barely understood it. I meen this kid kills his father and trys to cover it up and the police catch up with him. When they do they start asking him a lot of questions. He started to get confused and stoped answering them. One of the police officers got earatated and kept skowling at the kid. Even though one of the other officers told the kid that he didnt have to answer any of the questions that they were about to ask. The kid answers some but not all.Thats all that I can remember so goodby."
5,Tone Ann's Review,"My opinion on this book is that I didnt like one thing about this story at the end he still didnt turn Alex in. But on the other hand I liked this story because it has suspence, danger, and jokes."
4,gabba gabba hey!,I would first like to say Martyn pig rocked my world.It kept me on the edge of my seat until the end. It was like a turn pike with all of its twists and turns. I was so close to the edge of my chair I almost fell. This exiting Brit. book will take you to a small town in England where Martyn accidently kills his dad and tries to avoid danger and the police. Him and hid best friend Alex are digging their own graves but she has a deep dark secret.........bum bum bum do do do do bittily boo.......the end....or is it?
3,Pigggy piggy police officer,Martyn Pig was an good book. It was excellently written and had many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. It was a very intriguing story. I almost fell off my seat from all the suspence. I loved this book and I know you will too. If you like murder mysteries youll love Martyn Pig.
3,The accidental murder,Martyn Pig is a vver well writtin book. Some parts were boring but most of the book was interestin. the book glues your face to the pages. The story has a great climax he accidentally kills his father while dodging one of his drunken punches. he hits his head on the fireplace and dies. i recommend this book to lots of people. I give the book 3 stars
3,very slow start good ending,"This story is about a boy named Martyn Pig who lives with his father and does not know or remember his mother. Martyn's father is a horribly mean father who gets drunk every night and occasionally hits his son. One night when he is drunk Martyn pushes his drunken father causing his father to loose balance, fall over and crack his skull and die. Martyn freaks out and decides not to tell the police but to tell the neighbor girl, whom he has a crush on, what happened to his father and together they decide to hide the body. This story is really SLOW at the beginning and then it starts to speed up and get better after the first 170 pages. Not as good as Lucas but its not horrible either. But I do recommend checking out this book at the library before buying it."
4,Martyin Pig,"Martyin Pig is an electrifying story. Martyin's life changes when his dad dies. He has to make a huge scene that makes it look as if Dean killed his dad, with the help of Alex.Watch out because this book has many twisted parts that you will feel you were riding a roller coster! It also has a confusing ending. I would recommend this book. I give Martyn Pig four stars...."
4,Martyn Pig,"The story of Martyn Pig was very interesting. Martyn is a regular boy except his father is an abusive drinker. One day when Martyn and his father get into a fight, his father goes to punch Martyn, but Martyn moves outy of the way quickly and gives his father a slight push into the fire place. Almost immediantly Martyn knows that his father had died. I liked reading this part of the story because you never really knew what was going to happen next. i never once knew what was going to happen next, and the ending of this book was a shock, it was totaly unexpected."
4,Martyn Pig by: Kevin Brooks,"I thought the story was pretty good until the end because it was just like ""The Lord of the Rings"". It didnt really have an ending. It would be better if it had a sequal. If I had to rate it I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars."
4,Martyn Pig,"WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE STORY IS THAT MARTYN IS A MYSTERY KID, THE ACTIONS, HOW THERE FRIENDSHIPS GREW, THE GUESTIONS ASKED, THE ANSERS.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE STORY IS HOW IT WAS EXPLAINED, DEAN,AND ALEX."
2,Review,This book is ok but a little bit confussing. What I like about the book is the mystery the action how there friendship grew the queations asked and the answers. what I didn't like about the book was how it was explained the charaters and the ending.
4,Martyn Pig,This story was about a boy name Martyn and his father who had seriuos issues children in school would make fun of him because his last name was Pig Martyn really did not have any friend's accept the girl Alex. Martyn was watching television one night with his father Martyn was watching a detective show and the guy on the show kept yelling Lewis over and over so his dad did what the guy on t.v. and Martyn was sick of his dad saying what ever the guy say's on t.v. so Martyn pushed his dad.
3,PiG mArTyN pIg,"I thought the book MARTYN PIG was a good, but some parts in the book were boring. But when the book got to the action i liked it. If i had to rate this book out of a 5 i would give it a 3 because it was a mistery. Martyn was very good at lieing to the police and his own anut. But when when his dad died i thought Martyn and Alex were very good at claening up so it look like nothing happend. I think every boy and girl should read this book!***"
5,Review Of Martyn Pig!,Martyn is a quiet boy that lives with his dad who is an alcoholic.Well one day Martyn and his dad get into a fight and when Martyn's dad goes for a punch his dad falls into the fireplace and of course he dies. Martyn knows a girl that lives next door and he tells her what happened.This book is very interesting because it is a mysterious mystery through out the book because you never knew was going to happen.
5,Review of Martyn Pig,"The story Martyn Pig is a murder mystery. His mother left him at a very young age his father is an alcoholic who abuses him. He has a crush on his neighbor Alex who has a rude, selfish, lying boyfriand named Dean. Martyn and his father get into a fight and now Martyn and Alex have to cover it up. I like the book Martyn Pig because it is a murder mystery and you don't know whats going to happen next. I rate the story Martyn Pig with 5 stars."
4,Martyn Pig Review,"i liked the book Martyn Pig a lot. i liked it because it was different from al the other stories I've read before. I thoughtthis story would end with Martyn getting caught and taken to jail. But the ending was totally different!when it said that Alex ran a way and took all of Martyn's things, i thought he was going to tell the police and then they would go looking for her. But again I was wrong. Out library teacher read this book to us every week during library class. Many of the students couldn't wait until the next week to find out what happens next. this book was awesome, and i could read it again and again! I would reccommend people read this book. i give it a four-star rating."
5,MartynPig,"This book MartynPig was an alsome and outstanding book. This book is a must read book. Also this book could be read by children of all ages. In th story, there are some parts that are funny and other parts that are very very interesting. But most of all, this book is a little confusing. And that's what I thought about this cool, alsome, and funny story"
4,Rivoting tale,"This story is about a boy who grew up with a drunk as a father. One evening Martyn got so fed up with his father's alcohol problem that they started to argue. Then Marytn's father tried to punch him; but Martyn pushed him away. Just then he fell back and hit his head on the wall and died instantly. Alex, Martyn's friend, arrived shortly afterwards. Martyn has a choice, tell the police what happened, or hide the body. Martyn Pig is a rivoting tale about murder and how a boy deals with it."
4,Martyn Pig,What I liked about Martyn Pig the book was that Martyn and Alex were really good friends. I liked how the story was misterious. I thought that this story was really good in the beginning of the story and in the middle it started to get confuseing but all though it was confuseing in the middle of the story it was exciteing. I thought the ending of the story could have been better.
4,*Martyn Pig*,"Jennifer M.I liked the book ""Martyn Pig"" because it was nerve wrecking. Once you start it you don't want to put it down. You never know what is going to happen next. The setting of the book was easy to visualize. The characters had a lot of personality. This book is about a boy named Martyn Pig who's dad is a drunk. One day Martyn defends himself from his dad when he tried to hit him, and Martyn ended up pushing his dad into the fireplace and then kills him. Alex is the neighbor who Martyn is obsessed with. He told her what he had done.Dean is Alex's boyfriend and finds out also what happened to Martyn's dad. You will have to find out the rest! The author of this book is Kevin Brooks, just in case you want to read it ;)"
2,Difficult to follow,I am not familiar with the book or the series that preceded this film. Perhaps that would have made it easier to follow. It seems to me that movie making is just a more involved way of story telling. This might have been a great story if it were told well. Great acting talent just cant make up for poor screenplay and editing. The bee in the car!!!! I am convinced that these actors could have been in a great story had it been coherent.
4,Decent to above decent Thriller,"The story takes a bit of time to unfold, and Gary is just frustratingly good at playing a tight lipped spy."
4,"Follow it closely,It'll keep you guessing","Great cast! I bought It ! You just don't know til the end,It'll keep you guessing it was that good"
2,Poor Translation of a Great Mystery,"This movie was a great disappointment. To begin with it was a poor effort at reducing the six part mini-series to a less than two hour movie. The actors were bland, their parts underacted, their effort very lacking. The chronology of the events was disjointed, the story line weakly developed and the significant events underpinning the plot were lacking.The character Connie was not depicted well, we thought, especially considering the significance of her observations. Nor was the description of Ricky Tarrs' experiences well explicated. These two characters contribution to the story is the foundation of the investigation of the mole.No, one can not expect to reproduce in two hours what was successfully done in six, but it would have been better to leave this screenplay on the shelf.If one had not seen the mini-series, one would be lost to the significance of the true story as LeCarre had written it."
3,A slow burn that never really gets going.,"I tried, I really tried to like this film, even watching it a second time with the subtitles, but the slow pace was just dialed down a little too much for my taste. Well crafted, well acted, but the dial just needed to turned up a notch or two."
2,I didn't read the book and I probably should have...,"I sat through this mediocre piece of cinematography twice. The first time, I was lost 30 minutes into the film and I never found the exit. Having never read the book, it was virtually impossible to figure out what was going on. So, I read the plot summary on Wikipedia and decided to give it another go. The second time, I finally got the gist of what was going on, but the film never does much more than plod along. Very disappointing since the trailers present a rather fast-paced spy thriller -- which this movie, sadly, was not."
3,TINKERING WITH TINKER TAILOR NOT GOOD,"A not so great remake of the Alec Guiness/LeCarre classic, I did not enjoy this at all. Dialog is murky, hard to follow, acting leaves much to be desired. Stay with the original."
2,What a DRAG!,"Remember what a boring drag ""Ocean's 13"" was? This movie is even worse than that! I had to watch the first 30 minutes of this version of ""Tinker"" before I was altogether certain that Gary Oldman was even alive! Granted, the part of ""Smiley"" isn't one that projects vivacious glee, but whereas you can see the intricate gearwork turning in Sir Alec's portrayal of the main character, Oldman's version is expressionless, opaque, boring, and, (worse) not even particularly thought-provoking.You figure out what has happened, and who the real Soviet mastermind of the whole sordid mess is very soon, and the rest of the movie is just pro forma tedious boredom. Oh, Colin Firth does make a game attempt to inject a little life and passion into this moribund mess, but in the end it's all really a waste of time. But, if you have absolutely nothing else to do, and you can't get your hands on the Sir Alec Guinness version of the movie...well...."
3,Couldn't stay awake,"I'd have to watch this one again to get any sense of what was going on. It's just a hard movie to watch, definitely the most boring movie I've ever seen of it's genre. On the bright side at least I only rented rather than bought it."
1,Truly awful,"Kept waiting for it to develop. Forget the money, don't waste your time. This is a couple hours that I would like to have back."
1,Couldn't make head or tails out of it...,"After a full hour of sitting through tiny snippets of scenes, ""dollops"" of information, and what can only be described as a Picasso-esque plot, I simply had to give up. Not all the lovely production values or great actors in the world could make me sit through another minute of this movie. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was happening, or where it was happening, or when it was happening, or why it was happening.This is why this movie stank: 1) You can't care about what happens to characters if you don't actually know what is happening to them, 2) You can't get involved in a story if you can't figure out what the story is.This is the second LeCarre novel Focus Features has wrecked. Someone needs to stop them. Discreetly."
1,Avoid,"Do not waste your money, you will want to fall asleep but you can't because it is sobad and slow. I kept watching wondering why Gary Oldman got nominated but there isno reason, except that it's Gary Oldman and people who hadn't seen it must of voted.He never talks, he does nothing, just like the move, I want my money back."
1,This movie was so boring,"This sucked. Dont waste your money or time. The only reason I finished watching it is cause im sick and had nothing else to do.The script and storyline bounce around so much and sometimes doesn't make sense. There were a lot o unnecessary scenes. It was boring as hell. No drama, no having to think about it, or stunners. It sucked and I want my money back."
2,waste of money,i should have rented this movie from a colored box instead of putting out money to buy it..... not that great a movie
2,Lost in Space and time...,"I rented this film because I wanted to see Gary Oldman do something different than we are used to seeing him do.. I thought he was brilliant as he always has been, but was quite confused as what was going on.. I figured that it would all be sorted out.. That never happened for me, so I suffered thru it the next night thinking I would get it all sorted out, WRONG again.. I had not read the book, seen the miniseries, or known of the real event, apparently a prerequisite for viewing/understanding this film.. Sorry to have seen Gary in a nighmare film for me.."
2,Too confusing to be enjoyable...,"Great cast, acting and directing, but I really never knew what the heck was going on. If you thought Memento and Inception were hard to get, you won't like this either."
1,Horrible,I so much wanted to love this movie but I hated it.Read the book or watch the BBC miniseries and you'll understand that you can't cram this much nuance into such a tiny package.
2,Stopped after watching half of it,"This movie was so slow, we stopped watching after the first half. The next day, we thought we'd try again, but just couldn't get ourselves motivated to watch such a slow moving movie. What a disappointment!"
3,Three stars for Mr. Oldman only,This movie does neither the book nor the British mini-series justice. Gary Oldman can make just about anything work however and I did enjoy once again seeing his incredible skill as an actor. I just wish the movie itself could have been better by at least trying to do the book some justice.It is worth a rental. In my opinion it is not worth purchasing nor worth a second viewing.
2,I wanted to like it.,"I wanted to like it. Sorry, I didn't like it. I'm not a fan of the seventies style of film making. We have come so far. The story line was slow. I understand this was a book made into a movie. I think I see why many books are changed to go onto the big screen."
4,"Fantastic movie, minimal extras","The actual film is fantastic. I'm a huge John le Carre fan, and while I love the book most, I definitely prefer this film to the BBC miniseries, which in my opinion explained a bit too much.Unfortunately, the extras are quite minimal. I would have liked to see more behind the scenes discussion with the actors or production designers about why they made the decisions they did, perhaps something about the historical context of the book for us younger viewers."
5,Great movie,"I have seen both the original and the remake of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and will say that both are excellent, both are 5 stars, but one was a 6 episode mini-series and the other a feature film. I suspect that the REAL reason others have not rated the remake higher is because they also have seen them both and liked the original better. The remake has better actors, high quality performances and a story line that is easy to follow and characters that have no trouble getting their point across.It is a tough comparison for those of you that think they are comparing apples to apples when in this case that cannot be. It is much easier to gain and keep any audience when you have 180 minutes of a mini-series with which to work. The remake has one chance to capture the audience.but then you must have an objective audience to get a fair rating."
3,Read the Book First,"While I loved the movie, even without having read the book to know the full story, it felt like the plot was overly compressed to fit within 2 hours. I watched it intently, but there were still a couple of developments in the plot, as done in the movie, that seemed like huge leaps, where the book must surely set it out better. So I'm now off to get the book and the BBC series, as it is such a great story, I want to get the full picture."
1,Tinker Taylor solgea spzzz....zzzzzz....zzzzz,"This movie was so incredibly boring. My question to the director is, how many shades of brown did u use, in every scene!?!? Visually boring! Soundtrack wasn't boring... Because there was none! Flashbacks were the worst, there was no differance in the characters, the lighting, or sounds to let u know u were in a flashback. very hard to follow coupled with extremely boring equals me asleep and wishing I had spent the money on... Anything other than this movie! So glad I didn't see it in theater."
1,Can't make a worse spy movie than this,I had high hopes and was dissappointed by the jumping all around story telling and the lack of no suspense or action. You know this is the low income version. Save yourself a rental.
1,Piece of crap,What a worthless movie. It starts out with a shooting by an incompetent and goes down hill from there. Maybe if you have read the book this might make sense. I am angry with myself for listening to my neighbor. I thought he was my friend. This movie is about old spies so when you see them walk up stairs it takes quite a bit of time and for some reason there are a lot of scenes where there are old people walking and not adding to the content of the movie. The movie has an elusuision which I can not explain. It make the 2 hour 6 minute movie and makes it seem seem like six hours. The characters are not well defined. I defy anyone to describe what the jobs are with the exception of the guy looking for the mole. Five people make up the group and they know one is a Russian mole .... solution - replace them all until you figure out who the bad guy is.
1,Simply awful,This movie was simply awful and did not live up to its billing. If you like a movie which seem to be directed by someone who has advanced unmedicated ADHD then this movie is for you. The scenes jump back and forth every minute and a half with no semblance of continuity. The actors seem to be a bunch of mumbling old British men who we're dragged out of pub after church some afternoon and offered 50 bucks to come make a movie. The scenes were about as drab and dreary as yard sale in a convent. Amazon should have paid me to watch this movie.....I WANT MY MONEY BACK. My wife dared me to watch the whole thing to see if I could stay awake.....it was a struggle but I did it. My eyes still hurt.
1,"Disappointing, lifeless","Being a fan of Gary Oldman and suspense films, I hoped I was in for a treat. Sadly, this film didn't have a pulse and I turned it off mid-way."
1,Really Wanted to Like This,"There was some potential for sure but I just couldn't stay interested. Like the other reviewers said...soooo boring and painfully slow. I'm glad I wasn't the only one - I started to think maybe I just wasn't 'getting it'. With Gary Oldman in there, I was really hoping for something along the lines of 'The Contender' - which I highly recommend and has tremendous replay value. I think I've seen The Contend at least six times.Anyway, I'd pass on this... IMHO"
1,Boring and lengthy,This movie never got going. It is a shame to waste the time viewing this film. My wife and I both sat through it wondering when it would get exciting but it never did. The actors were good but the script was dull.
1,What a Boring Movie,This was one movie that I had wanted to see.Way over ratedIf I could return it I would.
2,Great sedative,"If you can't sleep, take a pill, read Numbers in the Bible, or watch this movie.I think the acting is great, but it is the slowest movie ever.I am a big Gary Oldman fan, but even he couldn't save this sleep inducer.S-L-O-W! Did I make my point?"
4,Alec Guinness is George Smiley,"The movie, while good, does not do justice to the story. You need to see the Alec Guinness mini-series. I love Gary Oldman and he does a good job but the story is too neat, too easy, and worked too hard to fit into the 2 hour movie format. After watching the Gary Oldman version it just slapped me in the face how really good the diabolical chess match with Karla was in the Alec Guinness version, especially considering it was 1979 vintage. Even with that comparison there were still several very good scenes in the movie."
4,Gives the 1979 mini-series a run for its money,"During the cold war it looks like that is a mole in MI-6. Control (John Hurt) and George Smiley (Gary Oldman) retire after a botched mission. Just because Smiley retired does not mean it is not him. Yet he gets the task of coming back unofficially to find the mole. We go through a multifaceted search. And of course it is supposed to be the last person you suspect.Actually I do not remember that much detail of the series. But I enjoyed watching it. I assumed this version would have to cut a lot out and might leave you guessing at how they got from one scene to the next. I was wrong. Every word and look had meaning. There are a tad too many flashbacks but time constraints probably force that. For a minute I thought of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" where there were too many clues. I have to confess I have not read the book so I cannot dissect the differences."
2,"Fine cast, potentially good story, dull film","The pace of this film was glacial: Two hours of dour expressions, slow pans right-left-in-out, and unintriguing filler scenes like the one with the bee in the car. This viewer went into blissful slumber several times. Even M. Night Shyamalan's films are fast-paced by comparison, and they always have a WHOA! ending. There was an effort to close the flim with a bang, but it came off as a whimper.And the blu-ray quality is not one you would use to demo your new plasma, a purposeful choice by the director no doubt.What a waste of excellent acting talent this file is."
3,Slow...Slower.....Sloweeeeer............,"This movie was the definition of slow the movie overall was ok but it was plain just to slooooow. Don't get me wrong I really like a good slow moving drama that has a good character build and a good story that at the least keeps you interested this movie just movied toooooooo slooooooow for me, it seamed like a 4 hour movie. Pass. I will always tell it like I see it.Scott M"
3,Disappointing,"I watched this movie simply for the cast and setting. I love a good spy thriller, and John leCarre is a wonderful writer. But the book is simply too HUGE to be condensed into a two hour movie. It was superbly acted, superbly cast. Collin Firth is simply perfect as Bill Haydon, but man alive, I couldn't follow the plot to save my life. I next went and read the book. What an amazing book! But it's as if the movie starts half way through and then makes half hearted attempts to go back and fill in. So many things made no sense to me until I'd read the book. I've now bought the mini-series and shall indulge in that next. What a waste of casting this was, though. And plot. It's a bit like the Kiera Knighly version of Pride and Prejudice. You simply can't condense it like that and hope to do justice to the story."
2,not worth watching,I love Gary Oldman. But this movie was a complete bore. Don't waste your time. They tried to hard to make the movie mysterious.
2,Confusing,"I am usually a fan of movies that travel back and forth between time (a la Michael Clayton), but for some reason I found it hard to follow. However, I thought the acting was good!"
4,Solid Performances,"I enjoyed the movie, but agree with other reviewers that compressing the book and series to a 2 hour movie was too ambitious. Great story from a great book. The stellar acting by Gary Oldman makes this movie worth watching."
3,An unsuccessful remaking of a classic,"The recent remaking of Le Carre's Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy unfortunately proved to be a unnecessary enterprise, resulting in a hard to understand, to follow and unenjoyable production. The BBC's mini TV series was incomparably better than this- and not only because faithfully and in great detail was able to put on scene the novel.A few good actotrs struggled with the unenviable task to put life into the characters, and Alec Guinnness remains the only true George Smiley."
5,spy-puzzles-galore,great fun for spy fans... nice to see and talk about before and after but not in-between... view preview before though. la carre's expert know-how adds flavor that's hard to duplicate....
3,Tinker,The movie is minimally acceptable. It is a pale imitation of the version done by Masterpiece Theater starring Alec Guinness.
3,Intrigue,"Been a while since I watched a spy intrigue movie. I liked it. Well crafted, well paced (slow but steady) but if you looking for action, explosions, car chases, this is not it. Intrigue, have to pay attention. British dialogue can be hard to hear sometimes."
4,A punctiliously crafted spy story,"""Tinker Tailor Solider Spy"" is an espionage genre film. Set in the 1970s Cold War tensions between Britain and the Soviet Union are presented as anxious with indications that there is a double agent within the highest echelon of the British Intelligence Agency.The narrative of the movie concentrates on the meticulous unraveling of discovering who the traitor is.The cast is absorbing with Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, and Mark Strong.It is a classic styled spy film and the mild pace of the story allows the viewer to assess the many factors and variables in order to discover the truth. The speed of the narrative may not suit espionage enthusiasts who are accustomed to rapid fire movies like the Bourne films. However, this movie challenges the viewer to think, which certainly counterbalances any lack of speed.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
2,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"Perhaps a good read would have served my needs better than the evening that I watched Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. The acting itself was pretty well done, but, the story was portrayed, in my opinion, in a convoluted manner causing it to lose the depth and quality that I expected. SMS"
4,spy review,A great rendition of spy games. True to life with enough action to keep you interested to the last gasp. A thinking man's movie.
3,The movie was OK...,"It was a bit slow for me. I thought there would be more action and some killer turns in the movie, but it wasn't what I expected. The movie is ok, but you have to follow it closely."
3,Pretty good,"This was not bad. A little slow at times, but overall worth a rental. You can definately get through a plane ride with this."
3,"Tinker, Tailor remake",Not near as good or as understandable as the BBC series of the same story starring Sir Alec Guinness; how sad.
3,had a hard time getting into the movie,"Loved the cast, but there was something about the storyline that couldn't keep me engaged. Maybe it was the complexity and I wasn't looking for that when I watched it. Dunno. All I can say is that I made it through and wouldn't watch it again."
2,Signe,"This movie was INCREDIBLY confusing and tiring to watch. I continued to try and understand what was going on; and at the end of the movie... was still pretty lost. If you are looking for an ""easy"" watch - this is not your movie choice. Be prepared to really pull together a fast-paced puzzle."
2,"Full of itself, and disappointing.","Full of itself, and disappointing. Hard to follow at first until you realize it's trying to more complex than it really is. I am perfectly fine with movies that move at a deliberate pace, but this one falls into a slow pace and never builds any real steam. This slow pace seems to be another factor contributing to the filmmakers' belief that the movie is more momentous than it is; the slowness isn't sophisticated pacing, as with some movies - it's just slowness. Gary Oldman's low key performace is fine, but not enough to salvage the movie"
3,Great movie! What was it about?,"Wow, what great atmosphere in this movie! Ah, the seventies- the cold war, deadpan glances that reveal far more than estimated. Sinister motives in the simplest of gestures. A world contained in a single missed implication... A car starts. A starling bursts from the shrubbery... The leaden sky. I understood that there was a spy in this darned thing. A coupla people got killed. Violently. The guy at the start lasts to the end. Meanwhile, there's something about some country that has churches that look like mosques. Otherwise, fuggedaboutit. All I remember is the color brown. Lotsa lotsa brown in this one. And the lead guy learns to smile at the end. That's all you need to know."
2,It is complicated,You have to watch it really close to keep up with everything and I really just did not like it very well
1,Boring,I have watched a lot of bad but well hyped movies. This one is one of the worst.Good acting but it was like watching paint dry.
1,BORING!!!! -_- zzzzzzzzzz,"Saw it once, don't care to see it ever again. Brittish and american spies are so boring. Is there any movie about soviet spies that takes place in the stalin era???"
1,Wow! I can't believe how much this sucked.,This movie started out extremely slow. There are movies that start out slow and then build up and become great edge of your seat amazing thillers. This is NOT one of them. The characters were completely uninteresting. I just could not wait for this thing to end. I'm not sure I could give a very accurate discription of this film being as I'm sure I fell asleep at least twice. One of the top 5 most boring movies I have ever wasted my time on. I gave it one star because that is as low as this website allows.
1,Dull,"I'll make this short and not so sweet. This movie was dullsville! Thriller of the year? Did Rolling Stone and and the New York Times send out the comatose former employees or what?! Actually, this movie could have been great,maybe, but the editing blows beyond comprehension! It is hard to follow, and completely dull. There is very little action in this film, the flashbacks are extremely hard to follow. And in all honesty, it's about as uninteresting as the rest of John leCarre's novels."
2,lot of hype,not a very good movie. just as dry and boring as you'd imagine british spys to be. : ) .
1,So Boring,"so slow, so boring. surprisingly dull given the accomplished cast. Watched about 40 minutes (twice due to loss of connection) before giving up due to boredom stupor."
1,"Dull,dead & disjointed, but....","Dull,dead & disjointed. Poorly written & acted & horribly directed but it is better than Ambien for sleep-inducing. Plus, it's free & non-prescription."
4,It's a really good movie,I have no clue about the movie when I started watching it. I've never read the book either. It was slow. But as the movies goes it became interesting. I finally understood what it was when the movie ended. Now I have the need to watch it again and enjoy every little moments. I believe it will be better second time around. But I enjoyed the first time also. Excellent casts doesn't hurt either.
3,Well made but an impossible task of compression,"It's unfair to people who have not read the novel and have not seen the Alec Guinness six-part film, to comment unfavourably. I think it may have carried a little more weight on the cinema screen than on a TV monitor. However, this movie did not have the time to paint the important and very distinct characters of Bland, Alleline, Esterhase, and indeed even Haydon who is so important in the story. Ricki Tarr was played too amateur and naive. Guillam was quite good, as was the too-little-seen Jim Prideaux. The production work is excellent, though so much filming through window glass became tedious. The novel and the six-part both contained much wit and clever dialogue, which is missing here. All that being said, my apologies for the moaning, but I am certain that anyone who has not read the novel (it does not tire after six readings!) or seen the six-part version will very much enjoy them, even after seeing this movie.t"
5,Please make the next two installments of the Karla trilogy,"If there is an Academy Award for the use of extras in a film, this should receive the award. Also, the locations and set and scene design is outstanding. Every role is a great role. Oldman is outstanding. PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE MAKE THE NEXT TWO BOOKS!!!!! P.S. Any director wanting to use the color green in a film must seek written permission from the crew of this film-- they own ""green"" now. A great script and wonderful art direction and just the right tone. I love how you never see the faces of many of the women in this film, showing that it is very much a man's world. Perfect casting in every role down to the man in Istanbul with the briefcase walking his dog!!! Loved this shortened version because so much of the text was taken care of visually in the location and set design. Masterful, compact and I think produced ""on the cheap."" Great."
2,No idea what was going on,"I guess I'm a bit thick, but I couldn't follow the plot in this ... still don't know who are the good guys ..."
3,Pretty Bland,"I found Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy overhyped. It's a decent kind of film, but hardly something that's going to keep an audience on the edge of their seats. For one thing, there are far too many characters and nuances to cram into a two hour film. Much better for a mini series perhaps where characterizations can play out and actually mean something. In spite of a strong cast, no one gets quite enough screen time except for Gary Oldman. Don't expect excitement. Expect to concentrate and then maybe feel a bit hmm.. about it. Of course, John Le Carre fans may love this, but so much is under the surface that it's a somewhat humdrum experience. Like that date that talks a lot but doesn't do much. Smouldering ashes..."
2,Not worth the money.,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a sad compilation of banal performances by actors who should know better, in a very slow moving, almost boring presentation unworthy of being tied to the great novel by John le Carre. A real case of unjustified hype surrounds this DVD."
1,do not believe the HYPE!,One of the worst movies I have ever seen ... I feel cheated at the $1.99 special streaming sale price. When am I going to learn to read reviews BEFORE I watch a movie???????? Acting sucked .the sets were dark and confusing ..A lot of money was spent on making this but it was all in vane......Bad story could not follow and Nothing like the original BBC story ..... Please if you have any respect for acting do not watch this movie.
1,Recipe For Confusion,"I saw this movie last night, hoping that it would live up to its reviews. Was I ever wrong. After about the first three minutes or so I was thinking ""What the hell is going on""? If you're suffering from insomnia, you're sure to be asleep after 15 minutes, as you'll exhaust yourself trying to figure out what's going on in the first 10. Do not get this movie unless driving yourself inasne is your goal."
4,Probably as good as it could possibly be,"The first thing that struck me watching this film set in the 1970s is how much it looked like a movie made in the 1970s. The replication of the look of a 70s film is an impressive and fairly subtle touch in settling the audience into the atmosphere of the film. The performances are top notch and it's a pleasure watching so many fine actors ply their craft so well. The difficulty of condensing a complex story into a two hour film, though, leaves viewers who are unfamiliar with the details of the story either because they have never read it or, in my case, read it so long ago as to remember nothing other than that is was good adrift a bit too much to be completely satisfied. But I doubt it could have been any better and still remained at a cineplex friendly length."
2,TINKER TAILOR SOLDizzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!,"I watched this movie knowing that the movie was based on a book by a well known author. I thought this should be interesting.It didn't take long to realize that the movie was much like the book - dragging on and on, and on and on. The grass grew three inches in the yard between the time I started watching and the time the credits started rolling.So, after getting a good nap, I got up for some action of my own - I mowed the lawn.Yawn!"
3,I expected more....,"I was really looking forward to this movie. It was not as good as I thought it could be. It was EXTREMELY slow in parts and I had a bit of an issue keeping track of certain characters. Of course I expected it to be a little confounding, but not blatantly opaque."
3,Glacial,"I read some reviews that said this movie develops very slowly, but actually it is positively glacial. I watched it through to the end, but it wasn't easy. I think the book is more interesting, richer in detail and more well-written than the movie. Good actors, though."
4,Needs for you to think,"Having read the book, this is a very worthy adaptation to it, read the book before so you can understand some of the unspoken things the movie doesnt explain."
2,A Le Carre classic,"This is a film of the book by John Le Carré, previously serialized by the BBC. Now I have enjoyed reading Le Carré and the TV series was exciting but I cannot get enthusiastic about this film. I thought the direction was very muddled. The plot (this won't give away anything important) is about the efforts to track down a `mole' in the upper echelons of the British Secret Service. The whole film jumps back and forth between the present and the past, and I was never sure exactly which I was watching. One of the protagonists gets shot in the end (as a traitor?) but another is dispatched to Moscow and yet another to Siberia. Were they all traitors? Was it in fact a conspiracy? I just thought the whole thing was a disorganised mess. The two stars are for the authentic Cold War atmosphere and the quality of the acting: but -1* for the direction."
1,impossible to follow,"The Alec Guinness version is so much better there is no comparison possible. This shortened version of the novel is next to impossible to follow. It is merely random bits and pieces of the story with no continuity or context. Oldman's acting is almost non-existent. At the end you find out who the mole is, but you have no idea whatsoever of how he was identified."
1,Simply Horrible,"The Smiley novels can best be described as ""character driven"" novels, in the spirit of any Graham Greene novel, but written by David Cornwell.So, how is it possible to make this film adaptation successfully and coherent if you don't bother developing any of the characters? Answer, you can't and this movie suffers for it. The mole, Bill Hayden doesn't utter one word in the entire movie and therefore you have no idea as to his motivation. You don't know anybody's motivation in the movie as George Smiley is the only crucial character to utter any lines in the movie and it's like George Smiley is sleep-walking through the entire movie.The producers, director, and anybody else responsible for this trash should be barred from ever making another movie, and that includes Gary Oldman, for whom I had held in great esteem . . . No more.Please, go out and buy the original version of Tinker Tailor, Soldier, Spy and forget the Oldman version. You won't regret it."
1,Incredibly slow and dull,"Bought this hoping for a tight, followable spy thriller. Couldn't make it past the 3/4 mark of the film. The story hopped around and the lot of us watching were just plain uninterested in what was going on. Highly disappointed."
2,Brew coffee first,"TTSP has a very intricate plot which, I suppose, is what you want in a spy-film. Even so, the movie is very slow, you don't really get deep into any of the characters, and it takes some will-power to suffer through to the end. Interesting in some aspects but rather dull overall.Not recommended."
4,Great Movie - If You've Read the Book,"As with other LeCarre books I've seen made into movies, there is much lost in the translation. In this case, LeCarre's main character George Smiley is by nature undemonstrative and secretive - both characteristics difficult to use to move the plot forward. Oldman does an excellent job with the character, and as a LeCarre fan I loved the movie, but others in attendance had trouble understanding and following the plot."
4,Loved this movie!,I loved this movie. It had all the elements of a spy thriller with the necessary intrigue. Highly recommend it. The main actor really comes into his own in this film.
4,Slow but good,This is not the most exciting version but the story is a good one and Oldman is fabulous. I enjoyed it but the old versions on BBC are probably superior and better yet - read the book
1,Stick with the orignal...,This is another sad remake of a great story. Don't bother. It is a mistake to try and take a six-part story and lodge it all into a one-part movie. Avoid this. Buy the real deal.
3,Disgusted with pre-release reviews,"By the time this DVD is released, there will be no space here for actual reviews of the product and its quality. If I wanted movie reviews, the woods are full. Amazon really should not open up this to reviews before ordinary customers have ordered, received and evaluated the product itself. I strongly suspect many of these prerelease reviewers are industry touts."
1,Can't find a worse way to spend two hours,"A movie with a very disjointed plot, no character development, poor cinemetography with some pointless scenes unconnected in any way to the minimal story line. Throw in an unnecessary scene of an innocent woman shot through the head while breastfeeding her baby, and you have the worst movie I've seen since Ishtar."
1,Absolutely terrible,"What a waste of time; absolutely terrible. It doesn't make any sense, and the story unfolds so slowly and arduously, it's more than boring. A waste of time and money."
3,Whither Gary?,"Solidly made, cerebral thriller with an almost criminally restrained Gary Oldman. A worthy, but unexciting entry in the espionage genre."
2,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,Movie just a two...just did not enjoy the movie...script interpretation was blah and just hard to follow..did not move along into a thriller spy movie...would not recommend a must watch thriller..
1,Too complex for just two hours,"If you haven't read the book, or seen the mini-series with Alec Guiness, I simply can't see how one could understand the plot. There simply isn't enough information in this movie. It is a synopsis of the entire story only, due to overall story's complexity.I wondered about how they would re-create Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy into a two hour movie without leaving out alot of relevant material and clues into who the mole is/was. This could easily have been a 3 hour movie, and still much would still have been missed. What proves my point as an example, is Smiley's meeting with Karla is only mentioned in a conversation over drinks. Instead of showing the actual face to face, which is an important turning point in the story. The lighter! Remember?Anyway, it gets a one star, for turning a good spy story into a confusing, watered-down version.Watch the mini-series, then read the book. Then you'll know what I mean."
3,Not too shabby,Does what is expected out of a strobe light this small. I barely use it - less than 10 minutes so far - but for some reason there is an odd clicking noise when I turn it on. It does not bother me too much though. Not amazing but great for the price.
3,my iteam broke a day after I got it. It dosent even flash anymore,I opened my iteam and plugged it in and it worked perfected and then I plugged it in the next day I had it plugged in for ten minutes and then it broke
3,Flash Me,"The Chauvet CH-730 Mini Strobe Light is an inexpensive novelty item. If used to spice up Halloween or to add a special effect to a home party, it will do the job, but by no means should this be considered useful as a stage tool or lighting effect in a professional application. The 35 watt bulb emits enough light to give an effect without causing headaches and convulsions, (good for home use) but is not bright enough to light a stage or large room. The unit could also use an on/off switch as the only means of turning it off is by unplugging the unit. At the price, it does what it is supposed to do, but consider your needs before making an investment. You might need to spend a little to a lot more if being used professionally."
3,strobe,bought it because it was a great price didn't use it for what I wanted to it is good for people in the arts for lighting
4,Good little strobe,"This strobe works as advertised. It's pretty bright. We were actually using it for a science fair project and found that it did not flash at 12/sec as advertised, it was more like 10/sec, but that is probably nitpicking for something that is designed to light up a disco ball :-)"
1,Dim and failed within 4 days,"The flash produced by this device was pretty dim. Could barely be seen in a lighted room. Though, it is a ""mini"" strobe light. Perhaps it wasn't really meant for very bright flashes.Additionally, after only 4 days of use, it ceased to function correctly. It would only blink a couple times a minute.I returned it."
3,"Good Strobe, Very Bright but some cons about it","I bought two of these strobe lights for my dj' set up and they were good except for when they came there was something that wasn't described on the purchase page. the bulbs inside these small strobes are irreplaceable. other then that one thing these are great! they came in fast to! and also i sent them back because of the information not being described as it should be it doesn't say anything about the bulbs being irreplaceable. i would recommend buying this product if your gonna use them a small amount of time, but if you plan on using them a lot i would recommend putting a little more money forward to pay to have a strobe with a replaceable bulb."
3,A little dim,I bought this for a high school dance. It was in a cafeteria. If you are in a big area it does not have enough power to create any effect. Also it will not attach to a mounting bracket without drilling out the mounting whole.
3,slightly disappointed,"i got my strobe light a little while ago, and i must say i am a bit disappointed. it was not as bright or as big as i anticipated. it works, but doesnt give a great slow motion effect unless it is completely pitch black. added a nice touch to my drinking party last night, but i definitely need a bigger and brighter one. however,if u want one just for fun, this could do. overall, not bad, but definitely not as good as i hoped."
1,Not an accurate description,Advertised on the amazon page as flashing 12 fps the box that this strobe comes in actually says max 10 fps and when actually plugged in it flashes inconsistently between 0-3 flashes per second at it's fastest setting. I bought this for a project where I needed approximately 10 fps so it was a big disappointment that the product is nothing as advertised.
4,Strobes,I was only able to use one of the two strobe lights I ordered. The one I used worked pretty well for one of the small areas. No complaints.. But I wouldnt recommend it for any larger areas.It has just enough power for small areas.
2,I expected too much,"This is the first strobe I've ever bought. I'd hoped to use it in my workshop as an ""alert"" light when someone in the house wanted me to come in. In a lit room, the light from the strobe doesn't reach a wall 6 feet away. From the corner of a darkened 12x15 room, it will provide moderate (but not bright) light for, e.g., a haunted house tableau. However, it's useless in a lighted environment.As I said, this is my first strobe, and I guess I just expected too much. Also, there is no on/off switch."
