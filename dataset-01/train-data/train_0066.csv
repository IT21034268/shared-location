5,Great Product!,"This is a great shower head! There are a few settings to choose from, but mine is usually on the most powerful one. If you have thick hair, this is the shower head for you. You can rinse your hair in a jiffy! :)"
1,I would rate less than 1 star if I could!,"We have a similar Waterpik flexible shower head in another bathroom and we love it, so when we needed a new showerhead for our other bathroom we sought out this product. It was a great disappointment and we have already replaced it. Although it had 6 spray settings, none of them fanned out wider than their point of orgin on the shower head; i.e. approx 2 1/2 inches. You have to rock back and forth a lot, not just to get rinsed off, but to stay warm! We were always cold in the shower, no matter how hot the water because the spray pattern was so small."
5,wonderful!,"Nothing bad to say about this showerhead,it does it's job.I am very petite,and my fiance is very tall,so this showerhead is very adjustable to both of our needs.I would definetly recommend getting this if this is the sort of showerhead your looking for."
4,Good item for multiple users,"We purchased a home with a shower stall and found 2 helpful uses for this type of shower head. 1. I'm tall, she's short and we often shower together (to save water)It's useful to move around to different positions. Shower clean up is a breeze when you can point and shoot a spray to rinse wall areas."
4,Showerhead,it is a good product...the only negative thing i have to say about it is the use of plastic threads...it was difficult to fix it to a metal pipe because plastic and metal just don't work together...but other than that it works great!!
3,Not as good as the previous model,"I owned two waterpik shower heads of the previous model. One needed replacement. This newer version doesn't have the same pressure, intensity, or spray width. Having said that, it's an OK shower head. It has a narrower shower breadth than normal. Water either projects from the outside holes or the inside holes. Never get a constant stream from all holes...not designed that way. I removed the water saving device to increase pressure and noticed no difference. Wish they wouldn't have ""upgraded"". The newer model is definitely inferior."
4,Very Good Product,This flexible shower head is an excellent product. It is excellent for those over 6 feet.
4,Good for the Price,"Easy to install. There's a very slight leak at the base, but it's not a big deal (just a trickle). Love the flexible hose for positioning...it even makes cleaning the shower easier. Good water flow even with the restrictor still in place."
1,No commen sense,"If you like 75 streams of water plastering a 2-1/2 inch area of your body,you might like this. The water does not fan out AT ALL. YOU have to dodgeback and forth to get wet.Some engineers are just looking for a paycheck and don't care what kind ofgarbage they put out there.waterpik should disappear."
2,Isn't what is advertised!,"I bought this shower head for my husband. He specifically wanted a moveable shower head with a mist setting. Amazon states this unit has a mist setting, however it does not. Also, 2 of the settings are identical."
3,Good for the price,Not bad for the money. All plastic so not expecting longevity. Don't have high expectations & you'll be happy. Watepik used to be quality products.
4,Flexible Showerhead for Families,"Nice Product! Handles all the shower needs any family member would want and it has a added feature, an 18 inch adjustable shower handle to direct the water in any direction or position. This is the main advantage of this showerhead over others in that you do not need to hold the showerhead after moving it to a different position. I love this thing. I have put these in all my bathrooms and the kids love it too."
2,Disappointing,"We had the older model of this showerhead so figured the new one would be even better. We have been disappointed in it because like others have said, it will not stay in the correct position and creaks when you move it. It also does not have the great water flow that previous versions have had. The final nail in the coffin was when we moved and tried to get it off, the threading area was so cheap that it broke off when removing it. And we had only had it on the shower for a year."
3,Leaks,"Great shower, but it does leak. After a week tried the teflon tape , made a little better, but still leaks. Due to being in a shwer/tub enclosure no big problem."
3,Could be better,I have an older model (15 years old) and it is WONDERFUL. This new one is okay but surely not up to the standards of their previous model. When you move the position of the neck it doesn't always stay where you put it. Still a good product for the money but not what it was in their older ones.
2,not so much,"This item is a big step down in quaility from the Waterpik shower head that it replaced. The old item ( 8 yer old Waterpik flexible) stayed in the position you bent it in, this one tends to droop it also has an anoying whistling tone on certian settings. And last but not least it is a very cheap plasticy chrome. Will not buy this item again nor recomend it."
3,very tiny shower head.,This item would have been a nice item however the rain shower head is the first thing I seen an was looking for that item. Big surprise when it arrived a seen this very tiny shower head. What I have standard is bigger. Very disappointed. Returned it.
2,time will tell,"I had a shower massage by this company for the last fifteen years. This massage was supposed to be its equivalent, it's not. The shower head is too close, there is only one massage setting, My original was metal and this is plastic. Time certainly has a way of making once quality products second rate. It works, it does have a massage and where is the competition. If you need one at least this one is cheap."
5,Waterpik Showerhead,"Good Quality for the price. We have owned this brand before, and have always had good luck with them."
4,flexi-neck,"The unit works ok. I wished other manufacturers would follow suit with the flexible wand/shaft idea. Competition is good, but waterpik must have a patent. The flexible neck is a wonder and works very good. The last unit I owned had a 5-year warranty, but the head broke off just after. So, I decide to purchase an updated version with a lifetime warranty. I found that the function dial on the upgrade is not distinct when moving it to each setting. It tends to glide too smoothly thru the settings, so one must play with the dial for the correct shower type. It does give a wonderful spray in each of the modes, but I don't think six are needed, because there is little difference in spray pattern for a few of the settings. The rubber nozzles are easily cleaned. Recommend taking the flow restrictor out of the flexible wand if your water system is 40psi or less."
5,Flex Neck Shower Head by Waterpick,"The WaterPik shower head is awsome. I'm tall and my wife is short. So, as the flexneck goes, just being able to move the shower head to the proper height is very nice. The shower head works great and is a likable product."
5,Hard to find shower head,"I was rebuilding our home in FL to sell it and realized we needed a replacement shower head for our small shower of the master Bath. The water pipe comes out of the wall in the wrong place so you have only a 2' square area to stand with a standard shower head. I looked all over St. Petersburg, FL and could not find this shower head. When I got home and did a bing search after getting the model number from Waterpik. The best price and delivery was of course, AMAZON. This product installs without any tools and was a dream. I now live in the NC mountains and use Amazon on a regular basis as I have had no problems with products or shipping."
3,fantastic shower head... for a little while,"I would give this item 4 or 5 stars as the water pressure is FANTASTIC at first. But after 5 or 6 months, the pressure is nearly halved. So twice a year I have to replace it. Considering it's relatively cheap I don't mind that much, but due to being plastic the insides wear down after a while.~L"
5,really nice showerhead,This is a really nice showerhead. Its flexible so you can point it to any part of the shower. It also has 5 different spray patterns. I highly recommend it.
5,"Love the ""gooseneck""","Could not find this ""gooseneck"" in the store so I was very glad to find it at Amazon. The flexibility of the neck is just what I needed. I just wish it came in a white color."
2,Very unsatisfying pressure.,"To be fair, the phrase ""works at virtually any water pressure"" is vague. It should have been a red flag immediately, but let the buyer beware. The flex arm works as in the description, but the ""satisfying"" shower comment is not accurate. I enjoy a hard needle-like shower, and this is NOT NOT NOT the shower head for me. If you're looking for a ""gentle rain"" with the same force as a feather floating to the ground, then buy this one. Me? I am passing this one by."
4,Good,"I had the old white one of these and was looking for another for the kids bathroom. I bought this, but was worried b/c of the reviews. Well, ours is great. We did take out the resister (water saver thing) and it has GREAT water pressure. The pressure is almost too much, I wish we had tried it b/f removing the resistor. I was worried about water pressure due to other reviews. And, it does not leak at all and is easy to adjust, again, opposite of previous reviews. We are happy with the purchase!"
5,awesome!,"I love this shower head. It is flexible, easy to install, and is better accomodating to my guests heights in my guest bathroom. You can temporarily redirect it while shaving your legs, etc. It helps with rinsing out the shower while cleaning too. I have two of these in my home now, and would highly recommend."
5,I have both the old version (that is at least 10 years old) and this new version (two different bathrooms),"I did not have any leaks. It flows well - better than my old one (but that could be because of deposits built up in the old one).Actually, I think I may just buy another new one to replace my old one. I'll change my rating if i have a problem with either one."
3,"Great shower,but for short people","With the regulator that comes pre-intstalled, this is just another showerhead. But removing the regulator makes it work far better than the other half-dozen or so brands I've tried (even with their restrictors removed). The high pressure setting blasts away, and the full spray setting feels like a downpour.We got this so that I (6'5"") and my wife can each have the shower head where we like it. But as other reviewers have noted, the flexible arm has a hard time holding the shower head up well. It makes it clumsy for someone as tall as me. Fortunately, I have a custom made shower that is already 6 inches higher than normal or I don't think this would work at all for someone my height."
5,Great Product,I looked in all the stores for an item like this but could not find anything. This product is great! It now allows me put the water where I want it. It also allows me to reach the shower head and change the water controls. The pressure is great! I would purchase this item again.
3,Works well and a hassle!,"Internet reviews were mixed from goog to no good. Both were right. Had to finally use some hot water plumbers tape to get it to not leak with a good seal. not it seems good, but installed and took off 12 times to get it right so it would not leak."
4,Good Product,We bought this to replace an earlier version that had a longer flexible hose. I need to rinse my shower so the flexible part is very necessary for our needs. It has worked quite well for changing height and direction for all of the different users in our family. I would recommend this product if you need some flexibility.
5,Too Tall ---Too Short,"I live in the land of short people. While the shower head was a perfect height for me, the little people began to protest and object to the one size fits one. Alas the Waterpik adjustable shower head. Peace and harmony is now restored and with the multiple settings, the little people are rejoicing with cries of ""Hail to the King."""
2,Good pressured spray but some serious problems.,"I bought this in Jan 08. The pressure and spray patterns are great. However, I get a small amount of water that backs up and comes out where my shower pipes screws in the product's neck. Also, I like taking the head and rinsing the soap off the walls when I am through. Several times the head has fallen off. Thankfully, so far it has not broke and pushes back in. All in all I would not buy this product again."
5,Showerhead,"I love this product- it is flexible, adaptable, and there is plenty of spray and pressure. The best showerhead for the price."
3,SHOWERHEAD,I HAVE THE MODEL THAT THIS WAS REPLACING BUT I FIND THAT I LIKE THE OLD MODEL BETTER. IT SEEMS TO HAVE MORE POWER AND PRIVIDES YOU WITH A BETTER MASSAGE.
3,Water Pik Flex Showerhead,"I have two flex shower heads by Water Pik and they are great since they can be adjusted for anyone's height or preference. Since Icould'nt find them in stores, I ordered this one from Amazon. It is flexible but won't stay in the position I place it. It keeps falling down. It was expensive and not nearly as good as the other two I bought at Walmart for about half of what this one cost."
5,Great H2O shower head,"Great shower head that is fully adjustable for all heights. The water variations are great. We have had this shower head for 3 years and love it so much that we used this latest purchase for a bath remodel in a friends family bathroom. Lowes sells it for $35.00, but when we checked it out on Amazon it was only $26 and the shipping was FREEEE !!!"
2,Higher price and lower quality,"Have spent hours looking for this item, the original was white and very sturdy. The flex tubing took a lot of abuse and it never cracked or broke. Only used this new model for 6 months and the connector that attaches to the wall pipe split and cracked which now leaks everywhere. I used the white one for about 10 years with no problems. Would really like to find the original ones that were a better quality and made with stronger materials."
2,No longer stays in position after 3 months.,"I used the flex hose to rinse the shower walls after each shower. It worked very well for three months, but something in the hose gave out and it no longer maintains it's position. May not be designed for the amount of movement I put it through. Loved it right up until it gave out after a short 3 months."
2,not like previous versions,"I have had a water-pik flexible neck showerhead since they first came out and it was time for a new one. When the new showerhead arrived and I installed it, I thought it was broken and sent it back. Alas, the replacement was just as bad. It was flimsy and made a rattling sound in massage mode. It did not have 6 settings, just 4--no water pause or misting. The most important setting it is missing is the water pause feature. I have a well and in a dry year it's important to conserve water. The water pause feature reduced the flow to a small stream--just enough to wash my face or rinse my razor while shaving my legs. If you have never owned the previous versions you would like this showerhead. It is easy to install and I LOVE the flexible neck. I will continue using my old one until they make a new one that truly has all 6 advertised settings."
2,shower head,"I found the older version better the white one, this one when you take out the restrictor to increase flow, leaks"
4,Good Flex Shower Head - Takes a moment to quit dripping,Good flex shower headDrips for a while after turning off shower eventually stopsThis is the 3rd time I bought this type of flex shower headGreat for staying where you want itThe spray is condensed so you don't have to worry about getting in and out of the shower with the shower onIt must be installed very tight and tools were needed but it did seal after I tighted with pliersWould by again
2,Not as nice as the old one,"Bought this to replace one that was about 5 or 6 years old. It is not as nice as the old one - fewer settings, settings it has are not the same as the older model. Seems to be much more cheaply made, too. the adjustment ring I don't see lasting very long at all. I am also very afraid to use any of my bath cleaners on it even though it's directions said I could use certain ones. I fear they will mar the surface."
5,A great invention!,The waterpik is such a great invention. I recently moved into a new house. The fancy showerhead that came with the house was installed very high up. By the time the water got down to me (I am only 5 ft. tall. ) it had almost evaporated! Just a joke. But the product is fabulous!!!
5,Dream Showerhead,"I've gone through a couple of showerheads before this one. I'm 6'4"", and with the long bendable hose, it turns any ""normal shower"" into a dream shower. Buy it, it's worth the $$."
2,White Boys do Steel Band??,"I didn't care much for this CD. As my title indicates, this is just a few mostly white boys doing cover of groups that I don't consider Caribbean music. Jimmy Buffett? Carlos Santana? Some of it gives you a good hint of steel band music, but it left me wanting more. Skip it if you're looking for authentic steel band music."
3,Lonesome Dove - Tale of the Plains,"While this video is not the same quality as the original movies, it is the TV series and get's much better as the series continues. I can only hope other episodes are made into videos...I enjoyed the series, it is light entertainment..."
1,Should have been a hardback book,"Expensive book with very poor binding that does not stand the test of time. This book should be updated and republished in hardback or spiral notebook binding because it does have worthwhile, although very dated now, information in it. A waste of money."
3,That poor binding quality is quite true,Good books should have good binding. Good books that fall apart at the center become worthless books. My SQL developer's guide split in 2 with 20 pages falling out and then one of the halves split in 2 again so I now have 3 pieces of book with 30 or so loose pages.
1,BIND QUALITY IS POOR.,One thing that really irks me about this book and all of theOsborne Tips and Tricks books that I've purchased: the bind qulity isquite poor. The pages are falling out after the first week. END
1,"basically, a failure - more on Victoria than Vincent","Technically, the writing style is very poor. If this was ""ghosted,"" Victoria should get a refund. But, basically - what you've heard on the street about this book is more or less true. For a child that wasn't around all that much, she is writing more from other sources. I hardly expected an unbiased opinion from the child of a broken home, but some of the none-too-subtle suggestions that Vincent was 'bi' and so on - without any factual evidence, only gossip - not to mention WHO CARES - is just too much. Another instance of licking one's emotional wounds in public, I'm afraid. Stick to the marvelous Lucy Chase Williams book, and the interesting recent book put out by Midnight Marquee."
3,Miss Prices therapy.,This is not so much a biography of Vincent Price as it is a book length therapy session for Miss Price. We can tell more about her thoughts than her fathers. Her own biases are clearly defined in this treatment. It's entertaining but not a must have.
1,Almost Daddy Dearest,"Victoria Price's book was a big disappointment. Price's own autobiography covers his early years, and the films are throroughly and more acurately covered by Lucy Chase Williams' book. Victoria's book is long, but the only ""new"" information would have been better left unsaid. Much of it is republican bashing from both father and daughter, at times it's hard to tell which is actually speaking. To them, it's heroic to oppose fascism, but those who opposed communism as well are ""villains"". The conservative bashing extended to trying to prevent the John Wayne Cancer Center from getting money Coral Browne willed them!"
1,A daughter's views.,"I considered myself a fan of Vincent Price since I was a small child. His voice, his height, his choices of roles, I was hooked. However, after having read Victoria's account of his life, I no longer consider myself a fan. Her views on his politics were not necessary. In my opinion, the comments bordered on hate. I wish I had selected a biography written by someone other than Victoria, then I would not have been so disappointed."
5,When being a rock band was interesting enough...,"Before TTH got all experimental and moody on records like ""Day For Night"" they sounded more like a shoot-from-the-hip southern rock band.And that was okay. They don't sound at all like this today, but the intensity still lives on.I fact my favorite Hip discs are this one, and any AFTER Fully Completely. FC and Road Apples sound to me like transitional records, as if they were still seeking a sound in between pure directness and complexity."
1,This sucks,"I could never figure out why this subpar band got popular, I mean sure Poets had a decent beat but this stuff sounds like ""trying to hard no soul"" rock which is the sucky kind. If you listen to their newer stuff which is horrid you can easily see why there was no fire behind these songs because it was a forced venture and not who they were or are."
4,great recipes,"im a fan of anna olson, sugar is my fav tv show, the definition is not so good, but my biggest complain is where are the other volumes???"
4,"Quick read, great story.","I'm a new fan of Jill Churchill and the Jane Jeffry Series. I enjoyed the writing and story and the only weaknesses I saw was that I couldn't understand why Jane would continue to go along with Shelly's project when she had such strong reservations. Also, I figured out who the killer was soon after she was introduced (and I guess that's kind of a biggie in a mystery). There were some distracting editing flubs too. But I still liked it enough that I will read the other books in the series.I found a story featuring women in non-traditional businesses appealing. And I appreciated the length. Some seem to feel a book is better the longer it is, no matter how the story drags in some parts. I say get to the point and get it over with. Thank you Miss Churchill.C.M. Miller, author Accrual Way To Die---An Audrey Wilson Mystery"
2,not as fun or witty as her earlier books,"Jill Churchill's ""House of the Seven Mabels"" seems to be a little lacking in her usual ingredients of tongue-in-cheek humor and enjoyable fun. The book will divert you for a couple of hours, and you will enjoy the characters of Jane and her friend Shelley, wives and mothers whose children are getting more independent, but more satisfying mystery fare is to be found in Churchill's earlier works."
2,disappointing entry in this series,"This is definitely the weakest entry in this series. If you're a fan, you'll read it, but be prepared to be disappointed. The story is weak and formulaic, the mystery is contrived, the characters don't seem as likable as before. Even the title seems to be trying too hard. Hopefully, if this series continues, the next entry won't be such a paint-by-number effort."
2,Not as good as others in this series,I have read all the books in this series and this was the weakest. I couldn't stay with it and skipped ahead to the end. Hopefully the next book will be better.
1,Awful Entry in an Uneven Series,"The Jane Jeffrey series can be pretty good--and it can positively stink. This entry is a clunker. I guess I keep reading the series for the prospect of a good book coming along; every once in a while one does. Churchill really needs to stop bragging about her parents in the diplomatic corps, and I can definitely do without her incessant snarky comments about her daughter (in contrast to her huge love for her apparently saintly sons). She also needs a better editor. Almost every dialog bit in this series begins with Shelley saying, ""Jane,--"" or Jane saying, ""Shelley, --"" This book was particularly grating in its gratuitous (and passe) attack on feminism, which Churchill apparently regards as a huge farce, as she does *every* social concern. Give the woman a t.v. set and a bag of chips and she's happy! Jane Jeffrey is more trailer park than she knows."
1,a real disappoinment,"My wife reads aloud to me by the fire. We have enjoyed other Jill Churchill books, so we were looking forward to this one. My Goodness what a mess! The plot was hap-hazard and undeveloped. The characters, humor and mystery were all non-existent. The pages were full of careless, unedited typographical errors, misspelling, and gramatical disasters. Words were left out of sentences and sentences trailed off without an ending. The conclusion of the book was a relief. What a shame! Maybe Jill Churchill had a deadline she could not meet. Maybe her publisher did not print it correctly. Maybe it was just a mess."
3,"Mabel yes, Mabel no.","Unfortunately I much rather preferred Jill Churchill's previous Jane Jeffry outing: Mulch Ado About Nothing.This time out Jane and Shelly are decorating a mansion for their friend Bitsy. The contractor is inept and soon dead. The tradeswomen (yup, all women, hence the catchy title House of Seven Mabels) are plagued by a series of practical jokes that delay or destroy their work.The characters aren't as brilliantly developped as they were in Mulch Ado about Nothing, which is a shame because this could have been a lot of fun. The ending seemed rushed and the discovery of the murderer left a lot to be desired.Maybe if I hadn't read and enjoyed Mulch Ado About Nothing I wouldn't have been as disappointed as I was with The House of Seven Mabels."
3,Not Her Best,"A typical book in this series, with Jane and Shelley occupying their time by solving a mystery.However, while there were a lot of suspects, the ending came way too quickly, in about two paragraphs. And the confrontation only lasted about two sentences.Definitely not the best in this usually entertaining series."
3,jane continues her series in the same predictable style,"the light murder series about jane jefferies are predictable and cute, a nice summer read or easy read any time. the reliablity is pleasant and the titles are always punny!if you are a jill churchill fan, you will read it, if not, try it and see if you like her!"
5,Musical Sea of Tranquility,"If this is the album by Chris Valentino, it is one of the most relaxing of any kind of music I have ever listened to---which is a lot. I had a big, burly TV repairman come to my house one day and he was having a ""bad"" day and was in a rotten mood. I put on Musical Sea of Tranquility and left him alone for a while. When I came back to him, he was in a terrific mood and even realized it was the music and wanted the title and artist before he left!"
1,Pirated? Just one long song -- no divisions,The copy I received from Amazon.com had only 1 song listed on it. There is no way to select which song you want to listen to since there are no divisions between the songs. It was burned as just one long song. What a rip!
3,"Good single, not so much the b-sides.",I really got into the first track and was let down by the two subsuqent tracks. I wish I would have just invested in their full length rather than buying this and than that.
2,"One fabulous hit, one nice song, rest, uninspired.","'Mr. Duality' is as great a song as the BOBS ever did. Funny, clever, musically satisfying. Right up there with the 8 to 10 wonderful, memorable, passing-the-test-of-time hits they have on their first four albums (s/t, My I'm Large, Songs for Tomorrow, Sing the Songs of). This is their fifth album from 1993.'Naming the Band' is like a notch below. Nice, fun, but not a bang up buster like they are capable of. Sweet.The rest of the songs just don't hit the mark. I can hear them using similar methods, working on vocal harmony, clever lyrics, fun stories of uncommon subjects but they don't come together even close to the greatness they accomplished on those other four albums, aside from the spectacular 'Mr. Duality'. God bless 'em. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
2,This is not a hardcover,"This is not a review, but a warning to potential purchasers: you should know that this book, listed as a hardcover for a cover price of over $30, is in fact a Scribner paperback. I learned that when I sent it to my mother."
1,Useless - wasted money,"The heat is far to weak to melt snow or ice. Besides that, the quality of assembly is very cheap. This device is wasted money."
3,Low score for high price,FYI--you can buy these cute sheets $20 cheaper (and less in S&H) if you go directly to Olive Kids online!
1,"installation nightmare, cheap models work better","This was not a simple plug-n-play.. Windows 7 played havoc with thedrivers, after finally locating updated drivers was able to get ti going.There is no noticeable noise reduction between these high priced adaptersand a low end model. Was definitly not worth the purchase"
5,Absolutely Awesome!,A riveting book that will open your eyes to the ecomomic problems in our society and how we got here. But best of all it explains in detail the solution to those problems. I loved it.
3,For true beginners only,"I bought the book hoping to find additional dumbbell exercises to complement the ones that I was already doing. This book offers only the basic exercises. If you are hoping to get started with dumbbell exercises, this book meets that need quite well. However, if you already have a dumbbell routine and hope to add to it, this is not the book you need."
4,Good book to get you started...,"The Great Dumbbell Handbook is very well put together and includes enough exercises to allow the reader to put together a comprehensive weight lifting program using free weights. The instructions are very well detailed and are documented through photographs to illustrate the proper techniques for each exercise. This book is for people who are just starting to work out with free weights or those who looking to add more routines to their free weight program, people who have been working out with a trainer or are already experienced working out with free weights will probably get very little from this book."
4,A very functional and useful book,"Simple, and to the point. This book demonstrates various exercises using dumbbells and there benefits. It was exactly what I wa looking for, and offered at a great price."
1,There Are Much Much Better Books Out There For Dumbbells,This book is extremely basic. If you want to get into lifting dumbbells you will end up buying Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness by Matt Brzycki and Fred Fornicola and Men's Health Ultimate Dumbbell Guide. Those book are great for starting up and improving. This book was of no use to me since I also bought the above mention books.
1,Holy Cow!! 5 Stars?! WTF?!...REALLY?!,This book is great if you're in grade school and mommy and daddy want their child to do some little workouts with their cute little bench and 2lb dumbbells. Or if you're recovering from a rotator cuff injury considering that about twelve pages are dedicated to shoulder work-outs. Other than the above mentioned this book sucks! Now I really don't understand how some people rated this book with 5 stars..OMG! Make sure that when you purchase a product please take the time to read ALL of the reviews. For in depth total work-out dumbbell routines check out Training for Strength And Fitness by Matt Brzycki and Fred Fornicola and Men's Health Ultimate Dumbbell Guide.
5,Excellent Book,"I was really surprised to see people giving this book an unfavorable review. If you are looking for a book to show you how to exercise with dumbells, this is it! No, it is not large or thick. If that is what you want, get a dictionary. If you want about four dozen dumbell exercises with detailed instructions and color photos, get this book. It's just what you want."
2,Too Basic,This book is fine if you're an absolute novice. Pick another if you want more than just bare bones basic.
3,Basic introduction,It's a good introductory book but I did not like the following:1) The reading before the exercises was not very clear and at some points actually confusing2) There was not enough detail in exercise description
4,Dumbbell Book Review,This booklet is good for the beginner weight lifter. It has all the basic exercises. What really surprised me is the thickness. It is a booklet smaller than a centimeter compromised of visual illustrations. Even though it's not as big as I thought it would be it gets the job done and illustrates basic dumbbell exercises thoroughly.
3,Not what I was hoping for.,I had high hopes expecting a compact book I could bring along with me to the gym.I was wanting something I could use as a reference. The book is small enough in size but only has a few dumbbell exercises in it. I'll probably donate it to the thrift store.
5,Excellent book,This book came in very handy for me. Was looking for something that had pictures and was easy to understand. My arms and shoulders look alot better! They toned up really nice using my 15 lb dumb bells. Would reccommend this book especially for beginners.
4,"Nice, relaxing music","Very clean, tasteful renditions of some beautiful pieces. This is good music to relax to but don't look for a lot of originality in the orchestrations. As nice as it is, most of the pieces all start to sound the same after about the fourth one. It's for listening pleasure, not analysis."
4,Exciting for the memories !,"While John Tesh has provided me with many enjoyable evenings through his music -- this CD allows me to also remember many of the best movies with vivid detail. If you are one who likes movies and music, this CD will allow you to relive the best parts of many excellent movies while working on any project. John Tesh has again provided us with an exceptional production and recording of his music. This CD will be a fine addition to your library."
1,This cd is not one I have been able to get excited over,"This is the first John Tesh cd for me to buy and it will probably be the last, stay tuned. On this cd John doesn't place himself in a position to really shine as a soloist. He uses guitar and some other electroinic sounds which keep his performanace at bay. I have grown accustomed to listing to soloist that can give command performances. This performance of Johns' is a bit shy of what I would call a command performance.My advise to John would be to cultivate his performing skills more to where he could possibly become a great soloist. I know it is a lot harder to performn as a soloist, but these performance are more than worth all that hard work.I Can Not Recommend This Cd"
1,I can't believe it!,"How can any of these people below me possibly say that this is a five star record. I listened to this as a JOKE, and it wasn't funny. Soul-less renditions of rehashed music from movies that we are just sick and tired of (we meaning the moral majority). I am beginning to think that these reviews mean nothing since there are too many five star and not enough of the truth (**note to Amazon** if this doesn't get posted - then I know that John Tesh is paying you under the table for the reviews. We will see within the week.) But in all honesty, this is the worst John Tesh album, which makes is a pretty bad album altogether..."
1,Lousy,"This may be a large but it is too long from side to side, not wide enough from top to bottom, and is the flimsiest window shade I have ever purchased."
5,A bop piano great. A strong quintet.,"In the 1950s, George Wallington was one of the best bop pianists in the Bud Powell tradition. Wallington led a number of excellent groups, including this quintet which included Donald Byrd (trumpet), Phil Woods (alto), Teddy Kotick (bass) and Art Taylor (drums). Good early hard bop and straightforward blowing by all. Highly recommended. Wallington disappeared from the jazz scene in 1957, to return in the 1980s with a few solo albums before passing away in 1993."
3,This book needs to be a little less advanced.,"A word of caution here, this is not a beginners book. More like an advanced or an intermediate book. If this is a beginner's book, then I would hate to see an advanced book. The first 2 chapters were okay, but starting with Chapter 3 it is a real lu-lu! It goes on and on about web controls and custom controls and dynamic control and customized templates and cascading style sheets. I think it would have been best if some of that advanced material had been left out and kept more simple for chapter 3 and concentrated on developing an application that didn't have to rely on all kinds of custom controls and style sheets and all other kinds of stuff. Keep it simple stupid would have been more the order of the day when it came to writing this book."
5,Drum Corps Fan,"I've been a part of drum corps most of my youth, and to me, the ""Land of Make Believe"" is the Bayonne Bridgemen , as much as ""Legend of a One Eyed Sailor"" is the Blue Devils. Two very distinctive and ""legendary"" drum corps shows of the 70's, at least in my mind.Most of the best of drum corps is a now a sweet memory for me, but Chuck Mangione and his unique talent always brings it back."
2,A pale shadow....,"...of the recording on Mercury, circa 1972, of the quartet featuring Gerry Niewood on reeds and flute. This recording is out-of-print (I've been looking for it on CD for over 5 years)which is a crime because to true jazz fans - as opposed to syrupy pseudo jazz - every note on every cut is right on the money. The band cooks and both Chuck and Gerry are in a zone. Gerry left the band shortly after, my guess is he didn't want to go in the direction Chuck was taking.Come on Mercury, reissue the Quartet recording! Let people hear what Chuck can really do."
3,Fair Early Mangione Recording!!!!!!!,"This album was recorded right after he got the idea to form a big jazz orchestra, while at Eastan School Of Music and drawn to be bop, rather than orchestral jazz. He was just starting out, but had some classics like Hill Where The Lord HIdes and Freddie's Walkin. Unfortunately, they don't appear here. But Legend OF The One Eyed Sailor and Land Of Make Believe do. They're the only good tracks on this cd. The others are a waste, and this is from a true Mangione fan. Chuck's albums didn't start to get good until around 1975. Alive was his only good early album. His early albums are all Live, which I hate, and are very experimental. I do enjoy listening to this album, dont get me wrong. But I'd rather be listening to something else!"
5,"Esther, Where are You?","I don't know what's become of Esther Saddlefield. Hopefully she is still making a good living and recording glorious music. All I know is that her rendition of ""The Land of Make Believe"" is on my top-ten list of all time greatest songs, period. Her voice is so perfectly syncopated to the orchestra and to Mangione's horn, that I can think of no greater synthesis between voice and instrument, including opera. She puts Dionne Warwick to shame. If you didn't listen to the radio during the 70's, buy this CD and find out what you missed."
1,Whiney Obnoxious Children,"The children in this dvd struck us as providing a terrible example of tone of voice and attitude. We bought this for our grandson, but could not give it to him. Kids often copy what they see and hear. The choice of songs seems good (we could not stand to listen to much of it, however) and I felt bad tossing it in the trash and was moved to warn others of the problem."
3,"POSH AND BECKS: "" A Big Yawn....""","Now that Becks L.A. Galaxy career has come to an end for this season, and the team is in last place, the euphoria about POSH AND BECKS coming to Los Angeles has almost become ""none newsworthy"". However, I think that Andrew Morton did a brill job of research and writing about an ordinary couple who became mega stars, only to find their glamour fade to a trickle in Los Angeles."
1,Horrible Author,"I just finished Victoria Beckham's autobiography ""Learning to Fly"". In it she discusses a horrible court case her and her husband had gone through with this author fighting for this book not to be made. The guy that Andrew Morton's information is based off of was Victoria's old bodygaurd. He was the man believed by the FBI to be the one sending the kidnap and death threats that held the family's lives in fear for years. I would never support a person that disrespected someone that i admire so much."
1,This is LITERALLY a collection of tabloid articles.,"So why did I pay good money for a book which has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW other than rehashed tabloid articles?? I could have just read through a newspaper archive. This book is full of ""reportedly,"" ""allegedly,"" ""it was claimed,"" meanwhile, isn't Andrew Morton supposed to be a journalist?? Couldn't he have confirmed or investigated any of these allegations, reports and claims?? This was the worst biography I have read in my life."
1,Not recommended,"I never read a book by this author before, so I didn't have any preconceptions. I was looking for a biography of two celebrities I admire so I could learn more about them and their rise to fame. This book was not a good choice. I can't say I learned anything new of any real interest, and I was put off by the hostile tone of the author, especially toward Victoria Beckham. No one is perfect, but this book really seemed to unfairly accentuate the couples' flaws and downplay their strengths. Nobody deserves to be criticized like that. It was unkind and not a pleasant read. I still admire the Beckhams for their many good qualites, however I'm not so sure about the author."
1,blah,this book didn't tell me anything i didn't already know. i guess i was hoping it would go more into friendships and events these two had been involved with but it seemed to just skim over their life with the bare minimum of details. i wasted my money.
3,"The Movie ""Bingo""","I would have preferred the language remain G in this film. I believe young children learn enough bad language out of the home, that it didn't need to be included in this movie."
4,A piece of childhood . . .,"I've seen this family film many times when I was a kid. Now, it has become a reminder of my childhood. Unfortunately, it isn't as great as the other films that I've watched when I was a kid (like The Land Before Time & Flight of the Navigator). It's very average for an animal flick. But it still has likeable characters, a well-written script, and some nice humor. ""Bingo"" can still enjoyable for families from all acround the country, but you are warned. There are indeed some fairly dark and intense scenes in some parts, so the little kids might be a bit frightened.Grade: B"
4,cute family movie,"B I N G O is a cute family movie, you can watch it with kids, and I (a kid at heart) liked the movie as well."
4,Pretty decent movie.,"I don't care what people might say, but I love this film. I saw it many years ago on VHS. So for me it's nostalgia to see it again on DVD in better quality... There must be something special about films, which you have seen, been a child."
4,Funny Dog Movie,"I purchased ""Bingo"" and ""My Dog Skip"" at the same time. Both movies seemed sort of episodic, but both were fairly entertaining. I wound up liking ""Bingo"" a lot more though since it was funny. Some of the comedy was a little outlandish (sort of like something you'd expect from movies like ""Naked Gun,"" ""Airplane,"" or ""Scary Movie.""), but some of the gags were downright hillarious. At times this movie seemed to be a movie about a boy and his dog and at other times it was more like the dog was the main focus. Since comedy was actually the main focus of this movie, this is forgiveable, but the movie seemed somewhat incoherent at times. While ""My Dog Skip"" erred on the side of the corny and sentimental, ""Bingo"" was filled with lots of strong comedy (and a few lame jokes too). So, if you want to have fun and see a movie about a boy and a dog, see ""Bingo"" and skip the other movie!"
1,Into the trash went this trash,"I don't even know where to begin. This movie is nothing -- and I mean nothing -- you'd want your kids to watch, no matter how old they are.Kids and adults in this movie swear, flip the bird and insult each other. The entire ""joke"" of a family that would wait out a night before looking for their lost child gave my son nightmares, and he's 10 years old. The flashback to a fire that killed the dog's mother frightened him and the dark plot that centers around an eatery that turns dogs into dogmeat utterly horrified both of us. We turned the movie off after 15 minutes and threw it away. I wouldn't regift this DVD to my worst enemy."
2,I haven't returned it yet but I'm going to,"These bags were just awkward. Didn't really fit onto my luggage rack very well. I've tried every configuration of bungees and straps I could think of and it still didn't tighten down like I wanted it to and it would have been a pain in the tookus to get off to take in somewhere. I ended up with a leather messenger bag from the big named dealer where we bought the bike and it was perfect. Rediculously expensive, but perfect."
4,Warm but snags,"These do a great job adding an extra layer of warmth in the cold winter months. The material, however, tends to get a lot of 'snags' in it as time passes."
4,Work fine for intended use,"I got these to keep me warm in my desk job. I think the polypro are warmer, but these are less bulky and much more comfortable. Another huge plus is these don't generate nearly the static that the poly ones did, so my pants don't turn into shrink wrap.Length for the indicated waist size was good. I'm tall and skinny, and they still fit snug without being capri length.They seem to be good for general comfort as a base layer. For long walks in the winter in business clothes, the edge still goes to poly or wool liners. But then again, I'm also cold about 70% of the year."
4,*istDS2 --- *istDS,"I bought a istDS, not the DS2. I bought it because I have had a pile of Pentax lenses. Overall, I am happy with the camera mainly because of the size, picture quality and battery life. Buy the rechargeable AA cells, they last forever. On the flipside, complaints are 1) the auto-focus does not seem as fast or as solid as Canon or Nikon. This is really true in lower lighting situations. 2) I shoot in raw mode because I seem to have to do a lot of tweaking on the images. Hopefully my two complaints have been addressed in the DS2. Adobe Photoshop CS2 does support RAW mode for Pentax, there is a separate download required (at least with the version I have).If I had to do over I would probably go for one of the semi-pro Canons. If price and size is of utmost concern, go with the Pentax."
2,Materialized View Section Needs Updating,"I only looked at the section on Materialized Views and must say that its one of the few books to cover this topic in some detail. However, readers should be aware that some of the parameters mentioned in the text are not correct and therefore will not work."
2,"Good examples, but not well written","Save your money on this one. I liked the overview of the ORDBMS in Chapter 1, and the treatment of partitioning, but overall this collection of tips is just that-- a set of tips for the expert minus a well-written orientation to new features. If you can glean more information from examples rather than the surrounding text, then this might be a good reference, but don't count on it to teach you the neat stuff in Oracle 8i."
1,tie review,Tie was late and we missed the opportunity to dress in our 60's attire like the other dancers. The tie will probably never be worn.
4,Surprisingly very good,This is a new author for me that I purchased on a whim. I was extremely pleased with how well written the book was and terrific character development. It was easy to follow and I would definitely read more by this same author.
4,Damn if it doesn't work,I've had lots of battery's for my powerbook but never one at this price. I haven't put it through it paces much yet but it seems as good as all the others at triple the price. the only reason I have 4 instead of 5 stars is that I still don't believe it and don't want to give glowing ratings untill it's been charged/discharged a number of times.
4,"Fine product, great price!","It was a great deal over the ""official"" battery! I've used it for about a month and no trouble so far. Good capacity. The fit was snug for some reason but I've managed to pop it in and back out without any worries. Looks just like the original with led status and everything."
4,Good enough for government work,"Yeah... you get what you pay for. Okay, maybe you get a little better than you pay for with this battery. I charged it the way you are supposed to (you know, charging it up fully, letting it run down once a week, etc.) ... and NEW, this battery lasts about 2/3 as long as a new Apple battery would. So... yeah. Slightly better than paying half the price."
3,Did'nt use,The battery was fine for the time I got to use it. The problem was not the battery on my labtop but the power plug
2,Low Quality,"Battery pack didn't last very long before completely degrading. It does makes an amazing coaster though, so it now sits on my end table with a nice chilled glass of ice tea on it."
1,"Worked good, then just died","It has been plugged in for most of the time I've used it. It has just a few dozen cycles on it, if that. It has not been left uncharged for a long time, nor has it been overcharged by some super high voltage fast charger.Now it just barely holds any charge. All it does is keeps me from losing data if I lose power or the power adapter is unplugged. Nearly useless."
1,It did not work,The battery looked a bit used and scratched; worst of all it just plain did not work. I tried to charge it but it remain in 0% no matter what I did.
1,bad deal,"I bought this battery just one year ago and it has had minimal use. It is now unable to hold a charge. I wish I had the ""official"" apple replacement productWasabi Power Laptop Battery / Notebook Battery for the Apple PowerBook G4 15"" M8859T/A, PowerBook G4 15"" M8859Y/A, and PowerBook G4 15"" Titanium Series"
1,Poor performane in battery life,"Purchased battery for wife's older G4. Performance was very poor, battery will not run computer without power cord for more than 20 or 30 minutes. Just about where it was with the old battery that I was replacing. Net we are out 24 bucks and wife must still use her G4 tethered to electrical grid. Some days you are a bug and other days you are a windshield."
2,Bought Sept '10 dead in Apr '11,This battery has been great for my limited 'off charger' use but has finally died after just 7 months use.I'll give it 2 starts as although it is poor quality I'll still probably by another one as $27 is cheap to resurrect my 8 year old Powerbook.
1,"Worked great for a few months, then failed after that","For the first few months after I got the battery, it worked wonderfully. I could use my laptop without having it plugged in for a couple hours at a time, but as time went on that period of time got shorter. A couple months ago my laptop would suddenly just die, and then I'd have to plug in the charger and have it charge all over again. In the last couple weeks, if it gets unplugged it'll only give me a minute or two before it dies completely.I would not recommend this battery to anyone."
4,No Complaints,"Received within a week of order, gave it as a Christmas present to my mom and she has no complaints and it holds its over 3 hours of charge very well."
3,"Wrong battery, right price","Can't complain. I probably read the description wrong, but it wasn't the right one gor my G4 Powerbook. Great, fast shipping."
1,At 4 months the battery was not useful anymore,I felt very disappointed that the battery's life didn't last more than 4 months. They are less expensive that if you buy them in apple; however you get what you pay for. The last battery that I bought directly in apple was more than 120.00 but it worked for more than two years.
4,1/3 the cost of the name brand,"I recently picked up a used PowerBook and sure enough the battery was totally dead. I didn't feel like paying more than half what I did for the computer itself on another battery, so I tried this one. I chose free shipping and had it 4 days after placing my order. The battery capacity appears to be just as good or maybe a little better than an OEM replacement. My software is indicating mine is 4912 mAh. The finish matches perfectly, and the fit is snug. How long will it go before the battery life deteriorates? Only time will tell. I will probably buy another battery to get me through long layovers."
1,Worked for a few months and then POW!,It worked nicely for a few months and now it literally holds power for less than 10 minutes. This happened with under 60 or 70 cycles. I wished I had just spent the extra money and got a real Apple battery.
3,"Good battery, but difficult to install","I was warned by the people at the Apple store that off-brand batteries sometimes had trouble with fitting correctly, and that's what happened for me with this battery. I think it was just a millimeter or something off, but it didn't want to lay flat inside the slot, and the laptop wouldn't recognize it. Finally, I pushed down very, very hard--to the point where I was worried about damaging the laptop--and it finally clicked into place. The battery works just fine now, but the design could use a little polishing."
1,Short Lifespan!,This battery lasted just over a year and now holds zero charge. When you unplug the charger it will instantly shutoff the computer. Very disappointed.
4,Cheap fix!,"I went about 2 years constantly plugged in because the OEM battery died - literally had 0 capacity. For $40 I'm free again. Probably not quite the original battery's capacity, but I can go about a week with light evening use and constant sleep otherwise without recharging. I'd guess I'm getting about 3-4 hours using wireless+internet applications (?)Was delivered to my door on a very cold day (~0F), and the aluminum cover fell right off. Maybe the glue wasn't design for that cold? Craft glue worked like a charm though, and the battery looks like the original. It actually fits into the computer chassis a little bit better, more snug, than the original.It really looks like it must be manufactured in the same Chinese factory as the OEM battery...Don't bother with the $130 Apple..."
3,OK as replacement,"My old battery had worn out.This new battery has acceptable run time , but effective time is more like 2.5 hours than the 4 hours mentioned in other reviews.I use the laptop occasionally, there is enough charge time that I do not need to plug in the adapter before using the computer.The battery at thirty some dollars is a good buy."
3,A Good Idea but.....,"The concept of this book is excellent. However, the videos were as though they were made for someone who already knows Flash. The videos are at a fast pace and very little explanation is given how to perform the commands. The book is equally hard to follow and does not give any clear examples.Bottom line is, I like the idea, but would not recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out with Flash."
3,a bit simplistic,"I thought this book and accompanying CD were a bit simplistic. Mr. Sahlin should do away with the ""props"" he uses as examples on the video - I felt this was ""dumming down"" just a bit too much. And, Mr. Sahlin may know Flash, but in this day and age, he should consider hiring professional ""talent"" for the video. At times, I found his pronouncition of words a bit hard to understand. The content of the book and CD was ok and followed logical teaching patterns, however, given this method of teaching Flash, just the minimum basics could be presented. There is just so much more to Flash. Also, the CD ran fine on my PC but after installing to the letter on my Mac - had some big time problems."
4,Enjoyable Read,"No one will ever be able to convince me William Goldman didn't write this, nonetheless it is enjoyable to find some scenes that were missing from the final cut of the film. Cheers to Goldman for his script-doctor work, and cheers to Damon and Affleck for accepting the Oscar."
5,Beautiful,"Good Will Hunting is my favorite movie. I think it is beautiful how Matt and Ben put so much of themselves, their friendship, and their hearts and souls into this script. I wish writers would put that much love into a script."
5,Good Will Hunting,"Hey, an Academy Award winner for Affleck and Damon. What more could you ask for. This proves that dreams come true through hard work and perseverence. Great job!! You guys are phenomenal. Can't wait for your next work."
5,Fantastic look into how the best movie of 1998 came to be!,This was a great look at how two unknowns came up with the best screenplay of the year. Great for people to read and see how scenes were developed and changed and for people who are interested in writing their own screenplay. Matt and Ben Rock!!
5,Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay,This was a very well written screenplay to one of my favorite movies. It was an entertaining read and I felt a great deal of sympathy for Will Hunting.
2,OK Script,I didn't think this was that great. I read this in one night and I was not impressed at all.
2,The American Civil War: A Union Divided,"Very disapointed at first. Very biased against the south. The first half hour talked how slavery was the cause of the civil war not states rights. Also it never mentions that the north also had slavery until the early 1800's and that the slave traders that brought the slaves in, in the first place where from the north. Some information is good but don't belive everthing that is said."
5,Claire Austin was the best she is my grandmother.,"She had a warm sense about her.When she sings she gives me cold chills. I have all of her albums and all of her CD'S.There is know one like Claire Austin,and I still listen to her music. The music industry should give her more credit than they did. Of course I would think she is the best, cause she is my Grandmother."
4,Only in Minnesota. . .,This story was wonderfully written--humorous and very enjoyable. I loved the all of the Scandinavian characters--they had great feeling and emotion. I couldn't put it down!
5,Night Play,"Not a dark hunter, but he'll do. This book is also funny and witty and my heart leapt for Bride when Vane got back at her ex. Ha!"
5,Completely Fab!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this one, I borrowed it from a friend whogot me into the series so much I've decided to order thewhole series. I love the fact that Bride isn't perfect,I for one am sick of reading about perfect women, I'm notperfect and I don't know any women that are. Bride wittyand she's funny and it's cool that she's not a size 4 butan 18. And Vane is great, tall and growly without being meanor cruel, he's as close to perfect you can get in a man, Ithink this is a great book, I think what I'm paying for itis money well spent."
1,A little to YA with sex,"The prologue had me interested, but the meeting between the hero and heroine totally blew it for me. I can forgive what, to me, was very juvenile dialogue in something like Twilight, which made up for that in tension, but this is an adult book and Twilight is probably the only YA series I will ever trudge through. I guess a girl in her twenties might still be in that really awkward stage but I wouldn't be able to socialize with her which left me wondering why the hero would. OK, so she's a bigger girl...why can't she set an example and be proud of who she is? Just a thought."
1,Not in Kindle format?,"Why would Book 6 of the series not be in Kindle format when all the rest are? Amazon please get it togetyher, very simple fix. If you list 1 book (or in this case 9+) of a series, please include them all."
2,ICK Factor and Pity Party,"Kenyon is a real ""hit and miss"" author. I have decided her books fall into 3 categories - ""Buy,"" ""Borrow"" and ""Don't Bother."" This books is a don't bother, because it's just irritating with a big ""ick factor.""The entire book is essentially ""really hot studyl guy has the hots for an obese woman."" Yeack. It's very difficult to like a character who likes nothing about herself and just feels sorry for herself. Several of Kenyon's characters - (such as Grace in book 1 and Sunshine in book 3) are described in rather unflattering terms, but in this book Kenyon takes it to a whole new level, and NOT in a good way."
1,Ugh! Completely Forgettable Trash,"Looking for something light to read between the last Dexter novel and the upcoming Vince Flynn, I pulled this one off the shelf. My Wife likes Kenyon, so I thought I'd try one. Unfortunately, I realized about 100 pages in that I had already read this one before. What total trash! Oohh, he's so sexy. Oohh, I can't wait to get in her pants..."" Blah, blah, blah. The unfortunate part is that it starts off almost interesting. But, it falls quickly after the prologue. Its a book about nothing, without Seinfeld's wit.Basically, all we have here is a writer detailing her leather-clad, bad-boy [...] for her readers, like all her other books. She came highly recommended, but I would never pick up one of her books again. Just creepy-bad!"
3,"Her weakest, alas","I had to force myself to finish this one as the story and characters it never really caught me enough.Also, while having a lush figure and carrying 10-20 pounds extra so the heroine isn't unrealistically skinny would indeed be refreshing, a size 18 is heading for, if not already, obese, sorry. An obese heroine contrasted with the hero being so physically perfect just doesn't gel for many readers ... myself in particular :-(And for those who blindly believe urban myths: ""A woman of Marilyn's height, at the extreme of Marilyn's weight range (140 lbs), would probably wear a size 12 dress today (which is the same dress size listed for Marilyn in the book The Unabridged Marilyn)."" See www.snopes.com/movies/actors/mmdress.htm"
3,Fat girl porn,"She's a good enough writer with a great imagination, but too much time spent on her heroine's size 18 body and the hot guy inexpliciably going for it is not only unconvincing but icky."
2,Disappointing...,"The sex scenes are quite disturbing. Especially when the heroine is a size 18. Maybe the author is trying to reach out to the plus size women and I totally get the point, you don't have to be stick skinny to live in this world, but this a romance novel and I'd like the author to at least keep the heroines the dress size they usually wear.She also has to be more convincing on how a classic handsome looking heart throb managed to fall in love with a woman such as Bride. She just seems a little plain."
5,Another winner from Kenyon,"I have just recently discovered Sherrilyn Kenyon, and I have to say that I am truly impressed. Her stories are always imaginative, and I can't put them down!! I've read most of her Hunter series, and it's only been one month! She's truly talented, and she makes you fall in love with her characters. I enjoy revisiting some of the older characters continually in her newer books; it's part of the reason I love the series. If you love an exciting plotline, characters you wish were YOUR friends, and chemistry between the hero and heroine, you MUST, MUST read Sherrilyn Kenyon!!!!! (Night Play is definitely one of my favorites.)"
3,Great book!,Love it! One of my favorite authors. Can't wait to read more Sherrilyn Kenyon books! Love that I can instantly download them on the Kindle.
5,Great story again!!!,"Finally, a real size woman gets a happy ending with the hot guy!!! Loved that aspect of the book. I'm already looking forward to both Valerius' and fang's books!!!"
4,Love those Dark-Hunter Stories Keep Them Coming,"I liked this story about Vane and Bride except for the ending which I thought fell a little flat. But if you are a fan of this series, you will love what you learn about the Were-Hunters and other shapeshifters, more about Ash and you get a chance to see some past characters and some new characters that are being primed for future stories. I have one question. What if Vane's parents decide to work things out? Hasn't anyone considered what Vane's mother has done to his father to make sure any future relationship is impossible? Talk about a living hell for the two of them no matter what the outcome."
5,Sherrilyn Kenyon Rocks!,"Again, Sherrilyn Kenyon drew me in to her Dark Hunter tale. This one revolves around Vane the Kattagari wolf who is attracted to the curvy broken-hearted, scared to love, Bride McTierney. As always, there are appearances from the other beloved Dark Hunters as well Ash and Simi. I never get bored of this series! The best thing about it, each book feels like a whole new series but it inevitably ties in the ones before it and will highlight events that will be broadened later. Sherrilyn Kenyon is amazing!"
5,Skilled writer,"Every time I read her books I can't believe how gifted she is. She's wonderful, my favorite writer. The book is delightful"
4,"Dark Hunters, Great Fun",I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Kenyon's Dark Hunter series. I'm looking forward to the Dream Hunter's next.
3,A new twist on a werewolf tale.,"Night Play is another foray into the mythological world of Dark Hunters and Were-Hunters in New Orleans. This is a pretty decent read; although not my favorite of the series. I liked Vane a lot. He is sweet, caring, and isn't the stereotypical romance hero. I loved getting a few more glimpses into Ash's mysterious character and I am always amused when Simi appears. On the negative side, I didn't like how the hero and heroine had sex as soon as chapter one - it takes away from the allure of the romance."
5,I wish I could read Sherrilyn Kenyon every day of the week,"I love Bride and Vane. He is so completely clueless about how to get on in human society and she is completley unaware that there is anything but humans around, kind of funny because she hangs around with Tabitha and her family but oh well.I think the roamnce is great and that Bride really grows as a person throughout the book. I love the whole series and have raed everything that Ms. Kenyon has written but this will always be my favorite."
5,Love It,"Its a great movie if you like Hallmark movies you'll LOVE this one!! It made made me cry so have a box of tissues beside you because if you cry when the people in movie cry, like I do you'll need the whole box!!"
5,Reconciliation is Awesome,"Love, love this one. I like the way the guy progresses from a boy to a man who decides not to be like his selfish Father. Great movie! It made me feel warm inside, especially at the end.."
3,DVD info only,"Re the DVD itself, not the film:* Pan and scan only* No close captioning* Subtitles in Spanish onlyGreat movie, not the best DVD."
2,"Lack luster ""B"" movie","For the names that are in it I expected a lot more than what I got. This movie gives the false image that lake boat sailors are lazy, drunk, foul mouthed and in several cases severely mentaly ill. I guess as a former great lakes sailor I found the movie offensive. I don't know where the writer got these ideas but it wasn't on any boat I worked on! P.S. The movie would be a lot better if it had a plot!"
5,Mamet delivers,David Mamet always delivers I have wanted to see this a very long time due to its limited release. Actors are wonderful as always.
2,Excellent lubricant -- terrible value for your dollar,"Genie GLU-3 Screw Drive Garage Door Opener LubricantPros:- excellent lubricant - 3 tubes in the package.Cons:- 1/4 ounce tube isn't quite enough to grease the entire drive-screw of my Genie garage door opener, but 2 tubes is too much.- absurdly over-priced at nearly $10 per ounce - ten times as much per ounce as Genie's Lubriplate 10 OZ Low Temp Lithium Garage Door Grease, which is $1 per ounce. See Customer Images for size comparison of tubes. (Grease from both products is white and has the same consistency; it seems to be the same grease.)Other:- previous versions of this product had black grease, but the last (and final) batch I bought was white.Summary:Although this is excellent lubricant, it's a terrible value. Buy the Lubriplate instead. Search Amazon on: Lubriplate"
3,High priced for the amount you get,"2.25 ounces - this is very expensive compared to the 10 oz. tube of low-temp garage door lubricant that Amazon sells. The other reviewer was right, three tubes barely leave a bead on my two garage doors while supposedly two tubes would have covered them. The screw needs a heavy coating to last a year."
2,UPDATE: Not so great!,"Works great, applies easily. The door now operates more quietly than before. I was skeptical that such a small tube was enough to lubricate the entire screw, but it was exactly the correct amount.Update 11/2010: As another reviewer mentioned, only 1-2 months after application all the hideous noises returned. Reapplication led to similar results. If you buy this, be prepared for frequent re-application at a high price. Rather than buying more, I will be trying the other Genie product mentioned by the other reviewer.Update 6/2012: Turns out the problem with my door was related to the design of the screw drive, not the lubrication. I have returned my review to 5-star. Per an Overhead Door repairman, my Genie/Overhead Door Screw Drive opener has a design flaw that creates a gap in the screw components when the parts are subject to cold temps. My opener only makes noise in the winter, so the explanation seems reasonable to me."
3,WARNING: DO NOT Apply In Winter,"It's January 14th, and I put on an application yesterday afternoon, January 13th. It was 20 degrees outside (27 in my garage, I checked last night).Just as the box said, I put some on, using one and a half of the little tubes of grease. The garage door came up, but now it doesn't go down. I think the grease is frozen/piled up inside the screw-drive garage door driver.Either that or the grease worked so well I will actually have to adjust the torque when the screw drive closes.I live in Minnesota, and it was 27 degrees Fahrenheit in my garage when I applied the grease."
1,Not a quality watch...,"I was very excited when I placed this order. Even after reading all of the bad reviews, I thought this has to be a good watch for the price. Especially with all of the military specs the company brags about. I received my first watch and could not move the crown. I emailed and tried to call Luminox support. No one would call or email me back ""RED FLAG""! I then sent the watch back and got a second Luminox replacement. It arrived and just was not a quality watch. I was afraid to get it wet. My final verdict is read the reviews. I think this was originally a good watch company, but due to it's mass production it has gone the way of the dollar, not the customer. End note; Cheaply made watch and bad customer service!"
5,Great watch!,"I purchased this watch from Amazon about 3 years ago. I wore this watch all through Basic Military Training and Tech School and haven't had any problems. The crystal is strong and the face is nice and bright. Great for Entry Control during dark hours because you don't have to take your hands off your weapon to check the time, there are no buttons to press! While the rubber watch band did break at the 3 year mark, it was only after I got the watch caught on a piece of equipment. I bought a 22mm NATO watchband for $16 bucks and it looks great and will never break."
4,A very nice watch,"Overall I am very pleased with my 3007 Luminox, and it has served me well for the past three years.PROs-The lume is very good-Bezel turns with ease-Battery is still going strong-White face edition (3007) is pretty cool in my opinionCONs-Strap needed to be replaced after the third year.While the strap did break earlier than I would have liked, I also really beat up on the watch, and am almost suprised it lasted this long."
4,Not sure,the watch is what was advertized.It is really light and I am nit sure if i is strictly the carbon fiber construction and design or.......Keeps great time and stays visible under all conditions. I did see on the Luminox site that one should be cautious when purchasing from anyone not an authorized Luminox dealer.I guess only time will tell. no pun intended.
5,TIME-TRAVEL BOOKS OFFERS PLAUSABILITY!!!,"This book presents ways in which time-travel can actually be accomplished and these are ways to which the average person can relate-not high-tech mumbo-jumbo! It explores the possibility of time-slippage as a normal event with the hyper-dimensional resonator as a facillitator acting in conjunction with time-slippage-which may explain things such as strange disappearances and the appearance of strange locations where they have never been seen before. If you have an open mind but still like to have some scientific background or plausibility to enjoy scientific ideas, then you will enjoy this book greatly!"
4,Let's time travel!,"This book is worth buying for the ""10th key to the riddle of time"" alone.Wild Bill Donovan writes a letter on july 29,1997 but it's a known fact he died in 1959...hummmm....but then again he was time traveler.Good book for all interested in time travel."
4,"Unbeatable price, beautiful music","For the price you can't beat this. The Piano concerto No. 26 by Mozart is heavenly music. The later pieces on this CD are not as exciting, but good background music for when you are working. People who play piano would certainly be interested in all the variations. Only complaint is there is no information about who played the music, or where, or when."
4,Phone won't stay in charging stand,"Nice case, I bought it mostly so the phone won't fly apart when I drop it. The case covers the power button for the phone, but the power button still works fine through the case.I have a charging stand to hold my phone upright while it's charging. The case has a cutout for the charging socket, but because of the thickness of the leather, the phone doesn't connect with the charger. You can still use the travel charger, but to use the desktop charger I'd need to take the case off."
4,Definitely a good Flash title to have...,"This is a nicely written book covering a variety of areas, and its really nice to see a chapter about actual graphic design in a Flash book too. Its really well-done as a step-by-step book for users who have an understanding of Flash that are wanting to jump to the next level and use Flash for more than just your basic point-and-click movie. Nice job guys!"
3,Good but not Lonesome Dove,"The movie is certainly worth watching but after getting to know the actors in the roles of the charactacters in Lonesome Dove, there is something lost with having to learn new faces in this movie. This movie is also a little more violent and lacks some of the ""softer"" moments we saw in Lonesome Dove. Again, it is worth watching as a finale to the series but you will not become as endeared with the characters in this one."
4,completed set,Was happy to finely find this movie for sale. Have been looking a long time for it to complete My Lonesome Dove set. Have been looking for 2 to 3 years and all ways would say out of stock. Finally amazon had it and for free shipping.
4,not Return to Lonesome Dove but entertaining,"I prefer Return to Lonesome Dove over Streets. Some think McMurtry tried to hard to distance this from Return and messed things up for the fans. I wont argue. I do like the production, rewrites, and cast. They help it to be an improvement over McMurtry's book. This movie has it's moments. Far better than the book. Not a bad one to watch when you've run through Lonesome Dove, Return, Deadman, The Series, and The Outlaw Years."
1,Terrible finish to Lonesome Dove.,"If you read my other reviews you will see I am one of the biggest fans of Lonesome Dove and even Return to Lonesome Dove. But Streets of Laredo is nothing like Lonesome Dove except for the names. Call a bounty hunter give me a break. But what is even crazier than that is Lorena married to Pea Eye. I think Larry made this so far out there to get back at Hollywood for their movie. What he didn't realize was he was hurting the fans who loved Lonesome Dove so much with this stupid ending. Any true fan of Larry's Lonesome Dove has to know this was not the way he had envisioned this to end when he wrote Lonesome Dove. Very disappointed in Larry's ending, give me Return To Lonesome Dove any day of the week."
1,Didn't care for it.,"Lonesome Dove was awesome, a wonderful movie. BUT this time it was like, veryone was, ""poor pitiful me"" not to mention the over acting on Sissy' part. Sorry I just felt that this series deserved a much better ending."
1,don't waste your time...,"I had hoped that this sequel might be up to par with the incredible, original ""Lonesome Dove"" which, in my opinion, is one of the best westerns ever made. It is not. It is a waste of film. To call this movie ordinary is being extremely kind. I don't know who cast this movie but they should have let Mox Mox, another 'man burner' set the guy ablaze. James Garner seems very out of place here and Ned Beatty playing Judge Roy Bean is ridiculous. Don't waste your time with this one, rewatch the original."
5,Streets of Laredo,"This movie is wonderful! I am a big fan of Larry McMurtry and have read the Lonesome Dove books numerous times. The entire saga is the best there is. This movie has a little bit of everything drama, action...Streets of Laredo and all the other in the series are definitly worth watching and for me, worth buying and watching over and over again."
5,Big fan of James Garner.,Good story and realistic for the time that these series of events occured. James Garner did a good job playing his part showing a human side to a stalwart cold character in most scenes. Sissy Spacek was outstanding in a frontier woman part.
5,An Excellent Movie Adaptation Of A Great Story!!!,"This movie is based on the book by Larry McMurty of the same name. James Garner plays Captain Woodrow Call who was once a Texas Ranger but is now a Bounty Hunter on the hunt for train robber Joey Garza.Every character in this movie is well played by a fine cast which also includes Sissy Spacek , Ned Beatty ( as Judge Roy Bean) and Wes Studi who plays the Native American Tracker Famous Shoes. There are a few unexpectd twists in this film and thankfully it does not have the usual ""happily ever after"" Hollywood ending. I LOVED the book and I loved this movie."
4,More Lonesome Dove,"Nice wrap-up for the Lonesome Dove series. I was hesitant, but James Garner and the rest of the cast did a great job. George Carlin was great."
2,Not good copy,"Tape was supposed to be good condition. Was in good condition ,but a poor copy It's a copy by ARTISAN Marked (duplicated in extended play)It's a copy from a three tape set, and done on cheap short ribbon type tape. Has poor quality color and a lot of blurr. I won't return it, but I won't buy anymore. Sellers should watch what they are trying push to the public. LH"
3,Larry McMurtry's Streets of Laredo,This was a dvd purchased for my brother. We had watched it on TV and my brother mentioned he would like to have a copy so when I found it on Amazon I jumped on it and got it for him. My brother says it is a very good story.
4,take a dead's man walk on the streets of laredo,"This one threw me off a little at first. I've enjoyed all of the Lonesome Dove miniseries and Tv series, but this one takes place long after those. A lot has changed and there is little to explain all that has happened over the years, but I was drew into this story as things unfolded. I enjoyed this one. I like to think that Pea was Call's Deputy in the flashback because it was during the time mentioned in Return to Lonesome Dove when Gus and Woodrow weren't talking. I know that ain't what the author had in mind, but it's fun to pretend! Streets is worth a look if you can accept the unaswered questions about the missing years between this and the other Lonesome Doves."
1,A waste of time and money,The movie has a great cast...but a great cast cannot do anything with a poorly written script and poor directing. There seemed to be confusion on whether this was going to be a serious adult western or a light hearted comedy western. The characters had no depth and were very uninteresting. Some of the characters were totally ridiculous. Lonesome Dove was a great movie....Street of Laredo should never have been made.
1,Streets of Distraction,"Great story; Loneswome Dove is one of my favorite Western series ever. I was desperate to see it again and couldn't find it at a reasonable price in DVD. Sadly, I forgot about the old 'SLP' format they used to use to get hours and hours on one tape. Cheap. This results in incredibly bad picture resolution and tracking - especially when purchased used. I hope to donate this copy to a school for the visually impaired as soon as I can find a reasonably priced DVD version."
5,I love Alexis Cruz!,I THINK THAT ALL OF YOU WHO HATE THE MOVIE STREETS OF LAREDO ARE CLEARLY BLIND OF THE AMAZING TALENT OF THE ENTIRE CAST POSSESSES ESPECIALY ALEXIS CRUZ.HE IS SO CUTE AND TALENTED HOW COULD YOU HATE IT?I LOVE THAT MOVIE SOOO MUCH.EVERYONE NEEDS A WAKE UP CALL WHO HATES IT.WHAT IS TO HATE ABOUT IT?I'LL BET YOU CAN'T ANSWER THIS QUESTION.I SAY LOOK FOR THE GOOD IN THE MOVIE AND EVERY MOVIE HAS GOOD PARTS.I LOVE ALEXIS CRUZ!
4,a very sad story to end the great western saga,"a story could be more concise and concentrated, but since it's the typical writing style of larry mcmurty, page after page blah, blah, blah were never tried very hard to omit wisely since the screenplay was co-written by the author again. james garner did a great performance in this final chapter of the lonesome dove. his height and weight looked more dominant and intimidating than what tommy lee jones could present on the screen.what a sad and malicious story to end the legendary call, a larger-than-life western hero. can't believe lorena would have so many children. anyway, the ending was quite anti climax and also very sad and helpless."
1,One killing after another,"If you enjoyed the grace and nuances of the story in Lonesome Dove--as well as the excellent character portrayal--don't see this one. If you like killing after gory killing, here you go."
1,Simply HORRIBLE Mr. McMurtry!,"Mr. McMurtry what in the WORLD were you thinking about when you wrote this series??There is almost not one thing believable in it. Pea Eye marrying Lorena? Are you kidding me??Please everyone. Go back for a few minutes and look at Pea Eye in the original series. Especially toward the end where he is with the dying Gus and his long walk before he is found by the group. Then watch Lorena for a few minutes at almost any time during the series. I'll wait.Is it in any way believable to you?Now you tell me Mr. McMurtry, do you think that your storyline believable even to you?Pea Eye is a blithering idiot! He is a ruined man after his walk in the wild! Now marry him off to the gorgeous Lorena that EVERY man wants??Sorry, but I think Mr McMurtry was so angry after viewing Return To Lonesome Dove, (Which I think is quite good and a Shakespearean MASTERPIECE next to this bit) he intentionally went about destroying the whole series.Just my 2 bits."
1,This was the most dissappionting movie i've ever seen.,"Streets of Loredo is terrible! I have never been so dissappionted in a movie in all my life. James Garner does not give Woodrow Calls character justice,neither does Sissy Spacek as Lorena. In my opinion they trashed a great novel by McMurtry."
4,"Fast shipper, as described","Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described . H b Fast shipper, as described .. Fast shipper, as described .."
1,Wasted money,I purchased this movie as a gift for a relative who is hearing impaired. The DVD has no subtitle option nor closed captioned. Poor quality.
4,Can't get enough!,"I guess I can't get enough of the Lonesome Dove saga & characters even though none are as good as the original. One reason is my favorite actor & his character are killed off in the original story. Some of the acting (especially in the beginning by ""extras"") is way below the worst of the original, but the main actors carry the story that holds up throughout. Although the end lacks something, it does bring the saga to a conclusion. I thought it could use elaboration of Newt's character & what happen to him. It is worth watching, but leaves you wanting more. Whether that's a fault of mine or the movie is hard to tell..."
5,"Guys ,Guns and Gringos!","This gun firing western is not only filmed in beautiful surroundings ,but also shows the great talents of young actor Alexis Cruz (Stargate).Plenty of gun powder and gory blood scenes ,but also very moving this is everything a western should be."
1,This was BAD,"This was a total mess of a movie. It almost seems unfair to judge it by the original Lonesome Dove except that it is supposed to be a sequel. Where the original was brilliant in just about every way, this is lacking. It is BAD. Captain Call is a totally different character here. I know he's older but c'mon...I had hoped that this sequel might be up to par with the incredible, original ""Lonesome Dove"" which, in my opinion, is one of the best westerns ever made. It is not. It is a waste of film. To call this movie ordinary is being extremely kind. I don't know who cast this movie but they should have let Mox Mox, another 'man burner', set the guy ablaze. James Garner seems very out of place here. Where Tommy Lee Jones was brilliantly stoic, James Garner just seems to be kind of lost. He's out of his depth here. Don't waste your time with this one, rewatch the original."
1,Stay away from this disgusting Western concoction!,"Imagine taking the worst of the Spaghetti Westerns,give it an illustrious cast (James Garner, SamShepard, Sissy Spacek, and on and on) and poura heavy dose of gore, rape, and an endless streamof meaningless sadistic violence: what do you end upwith? ""Streets of Laredo""The above excellent actors and actresses should feel ashamedof being seen in this awful and disgusting concoction. Thereare no discernible redeeming elements in this carnival ofgratuitious violence!Even you ""Lonesome Dove"" fans should stay away from this one!"
3,Stately,"This is a moving album. The feel is very Latin, many rhythms are Latin, and there are traditional Latin songs. It's not Latin jazz, though, that you might find on Concord Picante. It's more Mexican or Central American-sounding, and doesn't have the danceability you'd associate with Brazilian or Carribean stuff. A lot of the music is written out, but the improvisions sound very free. The highlights are the title track and ""La Pasionaria"". Though it has few weaknesses, I give it three stars instead of four just because it isn't uniformly compelling. The players are top-notch, Paul Motian, Dewey Redman, Don Cherry, and others I'm not familiar with all do a good job."
2,A Blunder For Sure,"I hate to say it, but this was not this author's best effort. I found the reviews of the battles very high level and some of his conclusions go against what I have read in other books. The title of the book accurately describes the contents of the book. The writing was really not that inspired either, sure these types of books tend to be from the war college point of view, but his writing is not even that entreating. I guess I should get the author some slack in that this book is probably more geared for a general overview, even though I still felt it was lacking in that regard."
4,"Very good, though get ""Full House"" first","This CD is a live set of Wes Montgomery with Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. It's truly a top-rank group. All Wes Montgomery jazz CD's are a delight, and this is no exception. If you've heard Wes before, this CD has his signature style. The playing ranges from sublime on ""Four On Six"" to a slightly unfocused on the ballads. I like ""Full House"" better. It has the same band plus Johnny Griffin on sax. This one is very good, and if you already have ""Full House"", or you're just hankering for another Wes Montgomery, I suggest you pick this up."
5,HEADS-UP TO ALL WES FANS....,"Just wanted to say there's a new Live release of Wes in Paris, in 1965, that is killer, called ""Complete Live In Paris 1965"""
5,Where did Ken Burns leave all the great Jazz Guitarists?,"My intent is not to belittle, please understand. I would however, like to know how in the world anyone can do a Doc. on Jazz and not include a piece on The Great Guitarists? John Leslie Montgomery played as much jazz as anyone I've heard. I would recomend this session to anyone who wants to explore hard bop, and some of the best ballad style playing available on the planet."
4,Share the Memories!,"For parents and non-parents alike, Memories, Lessons & Advice: A Guide to Parenting Issues is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Author Ron Snyder celebrates fatherhood by offering an honest, down-to-earth account of his child rearing experience as well as memories from his own childhood. Although it is called a ""guide,"" it is presented as a narrative with each chapter tackling a real life parenting challenge.Snyder's anecdotes are told with a wisdom and level headedness most often found at the knee of a grandparent. Written with honesty, sensitivity, and warmth, Memories, Lessons & Advice is both touching and informative."
4,An Honest Book About Judy,"I adore Judy Garland. (I also appreciate Mel Torme's singing.)She is one of the greatest entertainers of the 20th Century.That said, this book is a journal of what a nightmare it can be like dealing with what the French correctly call a ""sacred monster"".Torme doesn't tarnish Judy's legacy. Here he harshly but honestly illuminates a dark corner of her life.She wasn't perfect. By this time of her life, she was somewhat impossible to work with: like an injured creature, wounding those around her.This isn't an easy read for many Garland fans, I know. But it is a valuable contribution to understanding her."
4,Great Theortical Reference to the WS-* Stack,"This is a great reference book for the Web Services Stack and all the new specification and how they all fit in. Good starter when looking for a solution, but you will need other references for implementation."
1,Too high level,"There are several other books, that are over 2 years old that do the same job as this book. As an SOA enthusiast, you probably own or have read several of them already .. why bother with another one?"
2,A disappointing effort by a stellar band,"""Check This Action"" is miles better. So is ""Open All Night,"" but that little gem is no longer commercially available. Root through the used CD racks and the cutout bins for it. I love the Leroi Bros., but Crown Royale just doesn't have the punch of its predecessors. The band sounds listless and the songs just aren't up to the band's standards."
3,The LeRois can really rock...,"Although ""Crown Rolaye"" doesn't really show what the band can do live. It's a nice group of songs culled from two French (New Rose) releases. As with many roots music artists they are usually more appreciated in a foreign country than they are at home. The LeRoi Brothers play a mixed up stew of rock and roll like it's still 1963 somewhere in the middle of Texas. Live shows really are their thing. Maybe someday they'll put out a live record. Till then do yourself a favor- get this record, but also seek out a copy of ""Open All Night"" and ""Check This Action"" and make a compilation CD and see what the LeRois are capable of, oh and by the way come out to Austin, Texas to see the band really rock, LIVE!"
4,Excellent place to start,"This book works. It does, however, assume that you have a meaningful level of computer proficiency. This is probably a safe assumption for anyone intending to go spelunking in XML files and performing transformations on same.To complete the book's lessons, you'll need to download and install one of the free XSLT parsing engines listed in the book. Alternatively, I used the jEdit free text browser and its associated XSLT plugin to run the examples.I don't believe in assigning five stars, or I would have for this book."
3,Good book to start with XSLT,"I had a task to finish related to XPATH but to get better picture on the project I needed a better understanding on XSL and I needed to understand really quickly. This book was very help full. I recommend this to anyone who is planning on learning on XSL. Only complain I have is that, Some sections I felt like its a manual rather than a book that explains the logic of it. But most part this is not the case."
5,Just What The Doctor Ordered!,"I was initially reluctant to buy this book because almost 700 pages seemed like overkill to me, but I'm glad I did. Most publishers provide ""Bonus Chapters"" about XSLT and XPath, but this book provides the kind of detailed coverage needed to accomplish real world tasks."
4,Buddy Goes West,"Bud Spencer is one of my favorite actors. His typical manner is most amusing and I find his sense of humor really appeals. This particular movie did not include Terrace Hill, but it was still the same comical style and I loved it."
4,Amazing and Funky; not meant to be a Stone Roses Album,"This totally unique album has a really excellent low-fi vibe except for the vocals which were done on high end mikes. Its so well recorded and the songs hold up so well. All of Ian's albums are really funky and this is no different. The guitarist Aziz gives it this amazing and unique middle eastern vibe on guitar. This album doesn't quite sound like anything else I can think of. Check it out for yourself rather than listen to the reviews of people who don't get it. ""Can't see Me"" is particularly funky as it features Mani and Reni but the whole thing stands as a coherent statement. Hey he co-wrote all the songs on the first Stone Roses; He's got a lot of talent. Very modern funk/pop album that sounds unique. I listened over and over when it came out. But its not a Stone Roses album. Its its own thing."
2,discouraging...,"did this album have anything worthy of review on it? it must have really been a hurried album in the making, because brown can do better than this"
4,A break from the norm.....,"About one third of this album is awful. What remains, however, is awfully good. You could call this an experimental work where some stuff came out well, some stuff badly. Overall though what you get from this album is a set of songs that differ from the usual mundane releases so popular with record companies. Efforts such as Corpses, My Star and What Happened to Ye are just fantastic. The overall sound is raw and underproduced- in contrast to a lot of music these days. And also in contrast to The Seahorses album released by the other half (John Squire)of the Stone Roses song writing duo. The debut album by The Seahorses, ""Do it Yourself"" is quite simply rubbish! Maybe there is something in what Ian Brown said, "" the difference between me and John Squire is that I write songs for the people while he writes songs for himself""!! Nice to see that they still get along then!!"
1,Don't Let the Smooth Taste Fool You&#65533;,"It just sounds like the Stone Roses. Vocally, that is. In the aptly titled Unfinished Monkey Business, Mr. Brown gives further creedence to the theory that the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts, and the parts, when parted out, suck. Since we last saw the swaggering Stone Roses front man, we see he may or may not have learned how make use of a Casio keyboard (see track 12), he now practices some form of cool guy martial art (see jacket photos), and probably just put this crap out 'cause he was running low on puss (personal assumption by me). By track six, with some horrid female guest vocalist, any illusion that this record was worth half my 24.85 plus tax was blown. I wonder if they accept opened merchandise for returns."
1,Not worth it,"I was exploring the Paris Virgin Megastore and stumbled upon this. I thought to myself, ""Well, Silmarils was good, I wonder if this is good too?"" I listened and for some reason liked it. When I brought it home to California, I took another listen to it. I was confused: was this horrible thing what I listened to in the France? Well, it was and now I'm stuck with it. Maybe somebody will buy it off me. But it's got sloppy drums, sloppy vocals, the lyrics are nonsense (""There are no lions in England/No no no!"") and it just frustrates me to listen to it. But if you're a fan of Ian Brown's, I suppose you may like it. I sure didn't."
4,Good Historic Biography about a Little Known President,"This was an interesting biography about an accomplished General, Congressman and President. Peskin has done a great job of discussing both the military and civilian accomplishments of this great man. The book is usually entertaining and informative; however, at times it becomes a bit dry. Moreover, I wish Peskin would have spent more pages on the academical accomplishments of this one time professor. An interesting read for persons interested in post-reconstructionist United States."
3,Garfield,"If you are looking strictly for facts about James Garfield, this is a good book on a President in which little is known or written about. This deals with his religious upbringing, Civil War experience, and his political career. As I was reading I always anticipated the author was leading me to the climax of the situation, but I found myself only stumbling into more tedious facts about Garfield. For example, there are a few references to Garfield being a strong backer of our money being linked to the gold standard. I was anticipating the book leading me into insight as to why Garfield felt so strongly about this and commentary he made concerning this. But the author doesn't delve into it."
5,Rachel's book gave me hope that recovery was possible.,"Instead He Sent Me Angels...: I prayed for deathI first read Rachel Reiland's book a few months after I was diagnosed with BPD. Her story gave me such hope! Whenever I felt like giving up, I would go back to her book and her words would speak straight to my heart. I was deep into the self-injury aspect of the disorder; including, but not limited to, cutting. As I went through therapy, I would continually refer back to Rachel's book. I had pages marked and passages highlighted. In a sense, her book became my bible. ""Get Me Out of Here"" is definitely a must-read for those who either suffer from BPD or KNOW someone who does. Rachel's book gave me the courage and desire to not only get well, but to write my own story once recovery was complete. It's with a grateful heart that I thank Rachel for sharing such a personal journey."
1,Awful-an exercise in self pity,"Terrible- a long whining expose of poor-poor Rachel's BPD. Frankly it struck me more like-Rachel's rather a spoiled rich kid brat who grows up to be nasty spoiled bratty wife. She blames all her issues on BPD. The book was poorly written, one long overly melodramtic tale of endless whining and self pity. Bleeeh....don't read it."
2,ridiculous,"I usually enjoy psychology-related books, but this one was ridiculous! It was looong and tedious, and her drama queen behavior is downright embarassing. If I ever acted like she did, my husband would be out the door! He must be a fool. I've never come across anyone who is as full of herself as this woman is. I highly doubt this book can actually help anyone."
5,"Very moving, very encouraging","I very much enjoyed ""Rachel's"" account of her life and recovery; I found I couldn't put the book down. She does a good job explaining the feelings and thought patterns behind her ""crazy"" behaviors. The book flows very well, too. There aren't any huge gaps without some kind of transitionary explanation. I've noticed in some other borderline memoirs, there can be huge jumps, as if the book were simply a collection of short stories of the author's life. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Borderline Personality Disorder or psychology in general--probably at least 14-16 years old, though, as there is swearing and dealings with sexuality.I only wish the author had not masked her psychiatrist's identity. He seems no stranger to Borderline Personality Disorder, and I find myself in need of consultation for it. It seems difficult to locate professionals who are very familiar with it."
5,Great for therapists and clients!,"I am a social worker who currently does DBT with individuals diagnosed with BPD. I came across this book on Amazon trying to find some personalized success stories of BPD. This book is just that! It explores the reasons for the diagnosis, the individuals ""ourbursts"" and typical borderline behavior, and how her therapist deals with it and helps her gain insight to her illness. Definitely worth reading for anyone who has BPD, treats BPD, or even knows someone with BPD! BPD individuals can be difficult to work with at times, but this book shows that through perseverance, anything is possible."
5,Above all things gain understanding...,"A very real, raw and powerful account of living with Borderline Personality Disorder. It is extremely difficult for those who do not have the experience to truly understand the overwhelming hopelessness and utter despair when caught-up in the cycle. It is books like these that offer a glimpse into the dark nights of the soul of those who suffer. The labels are one thing, living it is something completely different. My gratitude to Rachel for her honest recount and my hope is that there will be more compassion and understanding for a mental state that is yet to be fully understood moreover, properly treated. The lesson for us all, let us not judge another until we have walked in his shoes and by then... we will have touched the deepest part of our humanity."
5,book,"Very good book, could not put down. Reminds me of a couple members of my family. arrived on time,excellent condition"
1,"Terrible book. Worthless. She praises abusive healthcare staff for ""helping"" her. Awful!",I cannot believe this book got so many good reviews. The psychiatrist that she praises so much was obviously a coN and abusive person. It hurt me to even read about what he and the hospital staff have done to her. Just like One Flight over a Coockoo's nest. The behavior of healthcare workers was completely inappropriate and abusive. Their licenses should have been taking away for treating a patient in such way.
4,Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder,"This book opened my heart to see beyond the act or words spoken by my BPD loved one... that despite how victimized I can feel at times, I know how worthwhile and necessary my continued love for my BPD loved one is as they consciously work through the obstacles and mazes on such deep levels within. It was illuminating to hear Rachel's raw, deep emotions, showing how complex our lives really are and I was pleased that it left the reader feeling optimistic about their own challenges."
5,GREAT BOOK!!,"Get Me Out Of Here keeps you wanting to read more and more, believing that no one could have borderline personality disorder this severe. But it is amazing how it progresses and has a positive outcome. I LOVED it and when I lost my first copy I got this second one."
5,Great book!!,It arrived quick and in good condition. Is a book that gets all your attention. It is a true story but takes you to a different world. Is not at all boring and you can read it without a problem. Is Great!!!
2,Dissapointing,"I picked this book up the other week and was quite looking forward to reading it as it sounded like a great memoir.My advice is this; if you're going to read this book be prepared for a very long (nearly 500 pages) rather dull and quite repetitive read. It seemed as though 80% of the book consisted of descriptions of Reiland's angry, out of control screaming matches with her patient-as-a-saint psychiatrist. I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again and it becomes rather boring.I have to say that the only thing that kept me reading is my interest in the process of Reiland's recovery from BPD and my hope that I would read of some sort of major transformation. However, overall I just found the book rather shallow, and although it IS indeed a memoir, I was continually irritated by Reiland's overwhelming sense of narcissism and self-absortion. Definitley not recommended."
5,Pomo Altar-Call,"""The Next Reformation"" is not armchair theology/philosophy, though it is among Dr. Carl Raschke's more accessible texts. Carl is a world-class professional postmodern philosopher who happens to love God and the church; he has done today's North American church a great service in writing.Could it be that history will reveal Derrida and the postmodernists as providing a service not unlike the service provided by Luther and the protestant reformers? I think Raschke would answer, ""Damn right!""Carl evangelizes evangelicals with God's invitation to faith/relationship offered through the prophets of postmodernity. I was almost expecting an altar-call, inviting evangelical Christians to personally accept and live into an existential conversion to a life of faith transcending objective truth, inerrancy, and worldviews. I highly recommend this text."
2,"Well-written in form, but flawed in substance.","The reviewer below who cited logical errors in Raschke's thinking is dead-on, and he identifies a common larger fallacy in postmodern thinking - namely, inconsistent logic. It's a favorite tool of the modern scholar to use straw men and ad hominems, because in so doing, they subtly trick their listeners into thinking they've got the ""other guy""'s number, then they go ahead and tear apart the argument.Personally, I'd be wary of anyone who wants to marry Christianity and postmodernism, because the two worldviews are fundamentally opposed to one another. This book is slick, and Raschke's a talented writer, but he's wrong. A better (or at least complimentary) read on postmodernism is Groothuis's ""Truth Decay"", because he accurately represents both thought-systems."
2,"Let's all just Hold Hands in Church and sing ""Imagine""","I've been reading several of the tomes on the Emerging Church and the need to become ""postmodern"". What I'm Discovering is a lot of the ""Fourth Wave"" and New Age philosophies from the 80's repackaged in a format that sounds vaguely Christian. The author lost me when he accused the evangelicals and the Rationalists of being the true Gnostics. To me the Author himself is the Gnostic."
1,Don't buy this. It still left me stranded.,"A complete waste of my money. This product is made from a material (I'm guessing some type of nylon) that is slipperier than ice. I bought it for the same reason as the previous review, to fix a snowblower that would take hours to disassemble and install a normal belt.I guess that would be a miss-application of the product, but I fail to see how a belt so slippery would be of any use to a stranded motorist. I bought this because it was cheaper than other products out there for the same purpose. Now I know why.Live and learn I guess....."
4,The Frozen Deep,Excellent Wilke Collins book. I have loved every thing I have ever read by him. This again is a very enjoyable read. I am so glad that more of his works are becoming available especially on Kindle as my sons bought me one for Christmas and I am enjoying my choice of many classics which I can read for very little money and some for nothing!
3,Aquarian Drumheads PF22 22-Inch Bass drum head,"I'm not a fan of the way this drum head sounds. I thought it would be a huge upgrade from the stock head that came with my bass drum that I've been using for 3 years or so, but it was a downgrade. It literally sounded worse than the no name bass drum head my drum set came with 3 years ago. But I gave it a 3 star because I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. I don't know if it's just my drumset that doesn't sound good, or because I'm using the same resonant head my drums came with 3 years ago (not beater head, the beater head is the Aquarian drum head in question), or because I don't know how to tune properly despite the time I've spent trying to learn how. I do know that it doesn't sound good on my drums, so as a consumer I can't honestly give it more than three stars."
4,Useful Phonetic approach to learning a language,"I purchased this book for my spouse who is learning Italian. Compared to other language books she has read which use grammatical instruction as the basis for learning a language, Berlitz attempts to use a phonetic based conversation-oriented approach. My spouse seems to enjoy it and finds it easier to learn because she can sound out a word's pronunciation, without getting hung up. The book is in excellent condition."
5,"Sign me ""Elated""","I could not be happier with both the service I received and the book itself. As I usually shop at local, privately owned book stores, buying from Amazon was quite a step for me. Because the book I needed was out of print, I opted to make that leap and was pleased with the timeliness, condiition of the book (which was excellent) and the follow-through- as exemplifed by this opportunity to review the process. The whole experience is compelling me to use Amazon more often, and I am about to order another book (or two, or three) right now. Kudos on a job well done."
4,good fun,"This movie is good fun. The actors are great: Emily Lloyd, Peter Falk and Adrian Pasdar. It's Peter Falk's typical role and if you like him in it, you'll like him here. Emily should have had more movies because she is great - and finally Adrian Pasdar gets a real chance in a movie. Good entertainment."
5,Great movie!,Love this movie and enjoyed watching it again. I liked being able to watch it on my computer before getting it in the mail.
4,Definite must for all Oracle Apps techos,One of the best books I have seen on this topic. The book takes you from layer to layer within the technology stack and equips you with the necessary tools and understanding with which to be able to look at most Oracle Apps environments and work through them methodically.
4,Easy to install and use,Works well. Installs easily - great for someone like me who has no mechanical abilities. Only one thing I wish was better: that the pulsating setting was stronger.
2,Short hose and flimsy head.,"When I installed this the flow regulator was so aggressive that the trickle of water was unacceptable. After removing the flow regulator I was back to the good water pressure I expected. However, the first time I tried to adjust the spray with the water running the head came apart. Apparently the shower head is constructed so poorly that it can only handle about half the pressure my shower puts out. This is the first time I've ever had a problem with a shower head or any other plumbing fixture so my water pressure, while good, is not beyond normal ranges. Also the hose is just barely long enough for my shower where the head is mounted about six feet from the shower floor."
5,Great Value,I purchased this as a gift for my brother.It arrived quickly and my brother absolutely loves it.He said that installing it was fast and simple and it works perfectly.
5,Works great!,I desperate needed one for my 6 month old boy. This one works great - no water drops! No regrets at this price.
4,Average,"The design is great with a sharp look which is the plus side to this review.I purchased this from its reviews here on Amazon to replace a cracked plastic shower head. After installing it, I notice the water pressure had reduced about 40%. I couldn't bare it and mix and matched parts with my old set to get it all just right.I wouldn't buy this again only due to the water pressure issue. Overall settings and look are really nice."
4,"Good, basic, hand-held shower head","The Waterpik TRS 553 is a good, basic, hand-held showerhead. It has three basic spray patterns that can be combined for a total of 5. The basic 3 settings are high dispersion (good for making steam), high velocity flow (good for general showering), and soft massage or pulse. Major drawbacks: there is no way to control the flow of water or to go into a low flow mode to save water (the default setting is low water flow, but some shower heads have a setting that slows the flow to a trickle). The hose is very stiff and makes the shower head hard to position. If you want a powerful massaging showerhead, this is not what you are looking for, but as a basic appliance, it works well and seems reasonably well built."
2,Odor problem,"While this product seems to be okay mechanically, I am seriously disappointed by the odor.Composed entirely of cheap plastics, the overpowering stench of platicizing chemicals is disgusting. The hose is the worst part.The stench has not passed in 3 days hanging in the shower and my experience is that when it's that strong it will not dissipate with time.When it warms up in the shower, it gets even worse.This is a serious caveat for those with asthma or COPD and I would recommend against this product for anyone bothered by chemical odors."
3,Reasonable handheld shower for the price,"Purchased this unit to pair with a fixed wide patter showerhead for walk in shower. Wanted a hand held option for cleaning, as well as massage options. The water pressure is adequate but not strong, even upon removing the flow restrictor. The massage action is OK, but not as strong as my original shower masssager from the mid 1980's.The vinyl hose is annoying as another reviewer mentioned, in tat it does not hang well and can result in shower head twisting while using it."
2,Inferior,"This works but...Using the basic spray pattern, the water shoots down in a straight line instead of fanning out as it does on other shower heads I've used. Not quite comfortable--having all the water striking roughly four square inches of skin.The other spray patterns are pretty much worthless. And water leaks out around the edges of the head. NOT a white tape issue, this is happening around joints created by the manufacturer. I don't like the stiffness of the cord either. It's always getting in the way. Next time I'll go back to Delta."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM,"The spinning face, which selects the mode and sprays water has come loose. Water leaks all around the head and thus, has lost all pressure. I'm pretty sure this item will be replaced by Waterpik; however, what am I suppose to do while I wait for Waterpik to deal with this? If there isn't a replacement, I'll update this review."
1,Plan to spend some more cash,"The shower head works fine...the water flow is good. However, there is only ""3 threads"" to connect to the shower arm. This will not connect to ""any standard shower arm as advertised"". Therefore, do not purchase this product if you do not plan to buy a ""connector"". Plus, even with a ""connector"" there is only ""3 threads"". ""3 thread"" to hand a ""1ld"" shower head that you will use twice a day. Now, even if it connect...how long will it last...?"
1,What! No Massage?,"I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon usually because the customer reviews are right on. I guess I should have read more closely. What a disappointment. I wanted to replace one I had - the ""Teledyne Original Shower Massage"". I loved it. I loved the pulsing water on my shoulders and back. This one installed easily as they all do, but what a disappointment. I'm definitely not keeping this one. There must be one out there that doesn't cost an arm and a leg."
1,No PAUSE feature,"Description lists PAUSE, but there is no PAUSE.its not listed on the package I received, either.I ordered this because I wanted a PAUSE feature.Would have returned it, but the old one was brokeand needed something in the shower."
5,Remember the Teflon tape!,This is a great showerhead! The instructions say that no pipe tape is needed...BS. Remember to wrap teflon (pipe) tape around all threads. I took another reviewers advise & removed the flo-control with needle-nose pliers because I didn't want to have to re-install the showerhead. The instructions will tell you how. I had to make a run to the hardware store after work & pick up tape & needle-nose pliers & I felt extra icky... It made my shower feel all the more refreshing!! $24.00 = great results! This should last a few years *****
3,Okay Product,"I followed the installation process, but I couldn't prevent the water from leaking on the main connection. I tried, re-tried without luck.. The leaking is not much, so I decided to keep it.."
1,Hose to hard can't bend...,"Got this handheld shower because of the brand. This product is good except the hose is very hard to bend even used for a few weeks. I had to replaced the hose with the old hose I have. Buying the better bendable hose from their website cost almost the same as the handheld shower. E-mailed Waterpik about this, & hope they will send me a better hose. Of course, they won't. I will never buy this brand again."
2,water stream too narrow,Nice brushed chrome finish. Water stream is too narrow in comparison to other similarly priced water-pik models.High pressure concentrated stream seems to be missing from this model. I repeatedly have to replace these models (4-6 months on average) as the unit becomes defective in the way of the water stream being directed in an unintended direction and in a diminished fashion.
2,So-So,"The pressure isn't that great and the diameter is small so the water spray isn't that great. Also, the mist setting shoots out over everything, literally sideways (I'd like to know how one would be standing there) and soaks everything. But, for the price, it's adequate."
3,Waterpik Showerhead,"Just an OK unit, looks decent. Does not deliver near the water volume of the fixed head it replaced (Speakman), this is with the flow restrictor removed. Bought it because of the hose and it should be a foot or more longer. It is adequate but not at all great, would not buy it again. Expect we will end up putting the old head back on."
4,Very good shower head,Great Shower head and great price. Looks good and puts a perfect amount of water. My favorite shower head of any others.
3,Works well,Works just fine. Settings are not very special. Just use the basic one. The other four are just kinda blah. Easy to set up though. Gives good height which is why I bought it in the first place. I'm 6'3 and the regular shower head was just too low to be ducking under.
3,easy peasy,"so easy to install. works good in guest bathroom, good price for what it is. only problem is that it doesn't hold in up position well."
4,Good shower head,This shower head gives good water pressure. I really like it. The shipping was pretty fast and I would advise anyone looking for an affordable shower head to purchase this one. You will not be disappointed.
3,The cord is a little weird,The item is OK. The cord for the water to flow through comes all curly and stil has not straightened itself out yet. Not sure how long that takes...Hmmmmmm....
4,Shower Head,"This is a nice shower head with a variety of settings. The hose is long enough, and it gets the job done."
1,very bad product,Compre esta ducha y en el momento de instalacion el acople que va al tubo de abastecimiento se revento al girarlo con la mano.
1,BEST IS MOEN ! OPTIONS YES !!,"MOEN MAKES A HAND HELD THAT WILL GIVE YOU A GREAT PRESSURE TO GET SHAMPOO OUT OF YOUR HAIR, AND ALSO A MASSAGE THAT YOU WILL LOVE ! 6 BIG HOLES IN THE CENTER FOR GOOD WATER RELEASE . JUST REMEMBER TO WRAP THE PIPE END 3 TIMES WITH TEFLON TAPE, SO IT WON'T LEAK."
4,Satisfied,"This showerhead was very easy to install, and works pretty well. Considering the low price I'd say it's a good bargain. We've had it over a year now, and have had no problems other than hard water buildup. (Not the showerhead's fault of course)"
2,Fatal Flaw,Cheap looking fixture and the hose connecting the shower head to the wall is permanently twisted into an awkward shape. Every time you take it off its mount it wants to spray wildly in every direction except the one you want. Great if you like wet bathroom floors and wrestling with poorly designed tools. My wife hates it and will replace it with something cheaper and more functional.
4,decent,"for the price, it cant be beat... however next time i'd probably spend the extra $10 or so to go up a lvl in quality"
5,Wow!,"So, apparently I have not been getting clean before using this shower head!I replaced an older Waterpik show head, since a lady friend bent the plastic attachment that connects it to the shower pipe, causing water to spew everywhere. This one costs less than the one I replaced (which didn't a have model number to reference), so that was already a good thing. The features appeared to be fairly similar, so I figured, may as well give it a go!This product does everything that it advertises it will do. On the package it says ""Power"" which is exactly what you will get! My water pressure increased ten fold! It took less than five minutes to install. I really didn't want to get out of the shower! If I had another bathroom, I'd buy another!"
1,DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE,"Very disappointed in this product. Had forgotten that I had returned a similiar waterpik showerhead a few years back for the same problem. Only one of the settings worked--the full shower setting. All the other settings had no force at all--not really usable--would not pulse enough to massage or even wash off soap effectively. And this was with the flow restriction device removed. Also, fairly large and clunky. To late to return, will be giving this piece of bad design to Goodwill. Sealed tough plastic packaging required heavy cutting to open--high self-inflicted cut potential. Would recommend looking for other manufacturers."
1,Massage setting is weak,"I had a great showerhead before with an effective massage setting for sore muscles. This one stinks. Wish I could return, but obviously too late now."
3,Could be better.,"Surprised to see all of the rave reviews? The massage isn't much of a massage even after the flow regulator is removed. The misting spray actually sprays sideways in a 360' direction, spraying the side of the shower curtain, floor, and shower wall more than you! When I use this feature, there is usually a puddle on the bathroom floor. I wish it was a more direct beam of water. The hose seems quite flimsy(rubber- not chrome), and overall this thing feels like a $10-$15(tops) shower head.However, the full body spray is very effective, and is as good as any other I've tried. That gets 5 stars, and the misting, massaging settings get 1 star."
1,lousy product,The hose still reeks after 6 months. It practically took an act of God to get it to quit leaking during installation. I had to double a gasket by taking one from my old shower head. The spray options were a joke with the mist one spraying sideways. Water pressure was low even after I removed the restrictor. I just replaced it with a new moen and will take the loss of my $$$ rather than deal with this piece of junk any longer.
2,WARNING: Plastic Parts,"While this item is listed as ""brushed nickel,"" and the shower head itself looks OK, the arm that holds the unit onto the shower is nothing but cheap, plain dove gray plastic (not even metal-look, just plain PVC). A metal attachment is standard and not only does the plastic look terrible (and is never mentioned, or shown, anywhere in the description), but it also doesn't seem like it would hold up very well either. This one is going back to Amazon!"
4,Seems ok after 1 week,"Seems up to par for a lower end Waterpik shower. I was aware that it was plastic when I purchased. The 'chrome' finish looks to be decent quality. very easy to connect with the included parts, and no problems with leakage. I used teflon tape just to be on the safe side. Does seem to have less pressure in the massage mode than the old (different model) Waterpik I threw out a while ago, but the regular spray has improved. If any problems come up, I'll use the lifetime warranty. Waterpik seems to be pretty consistent in this price range, so I'm sticking with it."
2,Piece of junk,"But exactly what one would expect for the price. I use it outside to wash the dobermans. I think they wanted to attack me for making them feel so 'ghetto'. The 5 modes are 1) where's the water?, 2) Is someone peeing on me?, 3) uh oh, it's leaking, 4) who turned the water off and 5) oh, there it is. Garbage!"
1,Hardly a trickle.,"Do not purchase this if you are looking for a hand-held water massage. Had I not opened the package and installed this device, I would have returned it immediately. I wanted something with adequate pressure to help my back and neck. This certainly was not what I hoped for."
3,this is not a review but an inquiry,"Can anyone tell me what shower head is the most powerful available, because I do notcare about water usage and saving water, blah blah blah, but I want a damn powerfulblast of water.I read these so called great reviews and then there is always someone who says it isa cheap piece of crap with low pressure. Every review on here. I spent hours readingthem and still cannot find a shower head that is powerful with good reviews.thank you"
1,Poor,"The product did not perform as I expected from Waterpik. The pressure from the head was low, even after removing all ""filters"" or water restricters. The hose was difficult to tighten and tends to leak."
2,Handheld Shower,"This is an 'ok' handheld shower wand. I don't love it. It has only one setting that I like and use. That's a shame with a total of five possibilities. The one that I choose to use has too high a flow, but still is the only one I like. If my husband had not thrown out the packaging I would have returned it."
2,Cheaply Made,"I was a bit surprised that the whole thing was made of plastic; I don't know how long it will last, but I kept it."
3,It does its job,"It's good for the price. With that said, I am not blown away by it by any means. I had bought this shower head for the ""additional water pressure"" that everyone was so impressed by. After taking out the regulator deal I have found that this unit leaks (I had to purchase some teflon to fix it). This is alright with me, considering that it does have a lot of water flowing through it. Yet, my biggest problem has been with the fact that it is not really much better than the unit that I replaced with it. I like a lot of water pressure when I take a shower, and this doesn't really do much.. It looks good, and it does what it's supposed to. But, it does not add a ton of extra water pressure. Btw, it is a fairly light unit and is metal (despite what I had read in some of the reviews)."
4,"Works fine, looks good","My reason for buying this type of shower head is that it makes cleaning the tub much easier. If I had a pet, it would also making bath time for them easier. The price was right, only $2 more than an unattractive white plastic one I saw in WalMart (shipping included). I don't often use the massage settings, but they seem to work as expected."
3,you know its pretty good,"It ain't bad, but it's made of plastic. Been using it 4 weeks, and I can't complain. It make water comes out the nossile. On the other hand it's cheaps. I feel like it leaks maybe a little bits, tho."
3,OK product. much better out there,Just got this product few days ago. Works fine but missing plastic ring tubing (I end up having to use tubing from previous shower head). Also the plastic long tubing connecting water source to head is of cheap material and bends funny. Would not recommend although it works OK.
2,leaky,"I had to return this product. It looked fine and the pressure was good, but despite adjustments with teflon tape and multiple attempts, I could not install it in a leak-free manner. Maybe it is something unique to my shower, but the second shower nozzle that I bought did not have this problem."
2,Weak Flow - Very Disappointing,"I recently moved to a new apartment, leaving behind an amazing handheld Waterpik showerhead that had great pressure. I couldn't find the same model (it was an all-white, plastic showerhead), so I bought the TRS 553, which seemed to be the closest match. Even after removal of the watersaving flow regulator, the 553 has an abysmally weak stream. And making matters worse, after 3 weeks of use, it sprang a leak that I couldn't fix even after reapplying pipe thread tape.I thought the pressure problem might just be due to living in a new place with lower pressure, but the bathtub fills very quickly, and the problem was solved when I switched to a different showerhead I found on the internet (although still not as powerful as the old Waterpik).If you're looking for a powerful spray, avoid the TRS 553."
2,decent spray no power on massage!!,"I bought this to replace an old 5 mode shower head that had decent but not great massage setting. I am overall disappointed with this product, even after removing the flow regulator it has a weak massage setting that is not much more than a strong spray. It looks good but if you are looking for a massage nozzle don't buy this product!!"
3,Good,This is a good product and bought based on the name... wish it allowed more water pressure to some of the speeds. The unit itself is lightweight and easy to hold. Next time I will do a bit more research and look for the high speed water pressure option.
2,Kind of cheap made,I was very disappointed when I received this because it felt so light. I went ahead and put it up and it leaked. I tried again and again but couldn't stop it leaking so I returned it and Amazon was great about it. They paid for the return shipping too.
4,Good shower head,"It is a good flowing shower head and has many different options. My only complaint is that is doesn't have a soft/low flow, I use it to wash little kids and all the settings at high pressure and very fast flowing."
5,good,"Great! Processes refined&#65281;Working fine, feel very good.Will continue to support the manufacturer of the product, and recommend to friends."
2,Horrible,This says it has a power spray but it doesn't have a power anything! I think it may have to do with the low-flow option but I don't like it. I've already spent more money on a better sprayer and this one has been moved to the guest bathroom. DISAPPOINTING!
2,Not all brushed nickel parts,"I purchased this hand held shower as an addition to my existing bathtub. I am changing over all my fixtures to brushed nickel, and expected that the mounting bracket would have the same finish as the shower head. No so with this model. The mounting bracket is grey plastic and makes an otherwise nice looking shower look cheap. I did not open the package, so I cannot comment on how it performs. I am returning it because of the grey plastic mount."
3,nice but has a short hose,nice shower head but you get what you pay for. The hose is very short. It did not reach to the bottom of the tub where I shampoo my daughter's hair. That would be my only complaints other than that is a very very good showerhead.
2,Waterpik TRS-553 Does the job but useless flow and miserable plastic cord,"Basically all the reviews with a one or two stars for this handheld shower set were correct. Here is the recap:1. Very low pressure/water flow. Not sure what the manufacturer's OptiFlow technology is but definitely it has failed here.2. The cord is a plastic hose that you wouldn't use as your garden hose. That's how bad it is, I ended up buying a SS from HomeDepot and replaced it.3. The different flow options are useless, when using anything but the basic/normal setting you might as well turn off the water.On the other hand:1. The installation was simple.2. No leaks - I made sure I used extra washers and tapes wherever I could after reading the reviews to be preemptive.3. The handheld shower itself is light but solid. Stays put on the handle and works for what I needed which is for cleaning the shower not so much for taking a shower with."
3,You will want to remove the flow regulator,"I received this shower head after reading the reviews and the first thing that I did was remove the flow regulator, you will likely want to do the same.Unfortunately, the plastic hose comes wrapped up tightly, so you have to pull it out and try to get it to lay flat. We have a small shower and the hose sticks out into our small shower area, but it seems to be getting better each time we use it. You have to try to ""train"" it to sit against the shower and not stick out.I have not noticed any smell associated with the plastic or any other components. It puts out pretty good pressure with the regulator removed and the instructions for doing so can be found in the other comments. This is definitely better than a standard shower head, but it is nothing really special."
4,Gets the job done,"First of all, let me state that I dislike low flow shower heads. Living in California makes it difficult to purchase, from a storefront, one that is not. The reason I deducted a star from this unit is that the low flow devise is difficult to remove and the hose could be a foot longer. Once the devise is removed, the flow is substantial and that was my main concern."
5,Great showerhead,"I just received my showerhead and I was impressed how easy it was to install! It took me around 3 minutes and didn't have to use any tools. the only tool I used was to remove the old one.Now, when I took a shower this thing let me impressed again. In my house the water pipes have a lot of pressure and somehow this showerhead controls the pressure to a comfortable one that won't hurt you but will make you feel very good while taking the shower.I have only used the regular shower mode but that's enough for me. My wife has used the other modes and she likes them a lot.For the price, this is a great buy!"
3,OK for the Price,"Shipment from Amazon very quick. Price was good. Product lacked a long enough hose for my purpose and I use a shutoff valve near the ""head"" to stop water flow but it would not install and allow the ""head"" to be placed into the holder piece. Will have to use it in a different shower or give it to someone who does not have my requirements."
4,Excellent value,"I purchased this item for a friend. I would give this item five stars, but the water pressure isn't quite strong enough to do the different massage settings justice (even after removing the flow restrictor). However, this could be because it was installed in an upstairs shower. It is plastic with a chrome finish, but seems to be very durable. You wouldn't be able to tell it had plastic construction from looking at it. If memory serves me correctly, it has a lifetime warranty. Definately worth the price."
4,Not disappointed,"This thing puts out the water. I only use one setting, but I'm quite happy with how well it works. It feels a bit cheap, but I'd buy again."
3,"Works well, with a caveat","I installed this shower head about 4 months ago. The installation was fairly easy - the hardest part was getting the old one out. There's not a whole lot one can say about a shower head other than it passes water as advertised. I do wish there was a way to temporarily stop the water flow.Why did I give it 3 stars? Because 4 months later, the hose still has that strong PVC smell. This is the first time I've ever had this issue, and it will definitely lead me to avoid this brand in the future."
4,waterpik showerhead,"this is a pretty nice showerhead, it was easy to install. I removed the flow restrictor, which was pretty easy to do, just a yank with the needlenose pliers. The massage is not as poweful as it was in my old showerhead, but it is OK. a good deal all around esp at this price."
4,Plastic but a nice shower head,Bought this about a month ago and have been pleased with the solid spray pattern. Many other shower heads kind of trickle out and I have a hard time getting soap and shampoo off. I knew before I bought this that it was a plastic body but for the price it services us well and expect many years of use.I give it a solid 4
4,great product,"easily installed, wonderful product, can't believe it took us this long to spend less than $20 to upgrade our showering experience."
2,"Adequate, barely","This is the second one we've purchased, and although it does the job, it's pretty limited. As far as the head goes, the massage and mist settings aren't useful, but it works ok as a regular showerhead. The real problem is that the hose they use now is way too rigid for the application. Even after a couple weeks, it still hasn't laid against the wall. If we had a showerstall, this would definitely be a problem. See the picture. Buying a better hose for $15 or more sort of eliminates the savings."
1,Poor quality,"The connection to hook it up is very shoddy. PLASTIC and won't tighten up without appearing as though it will break or crack. It leaks and wouldn't last very long. Too bad, Waterpik used to make a decent product. Unforunately most of these showerheads are all plastic now and need replacing often, they are almost disposable."
2,not enough pressure,"The Waterpik TRS - 553 has been a disappointment because of the weak flow of water on fast massage. We have plenty of pressure in our shower ( new plumbing, etc.) and my old Waterpik was great! really giving a deep massage until I could no longer change settings.The new unit, on fast massage, barely washes the soap and conditioner off the shower floor."
3,Good but not enough water pressure for me,"Hard to find one with enough water pressure that is not too expensive... oh well... it is good, just not great."
3,just passable..,"I ordered this hoping it would help to increase my lousey water pressure. I replaced a perfectly functionable ""older"" Water pik shower massage hand-held. You know, the white one with multiple colored options. I just replaced the hand-held part as my hose was good and there were multiple negative comments on the newer hose. Don't have the water restrictor in place and shower pressure is worst than it was with older unit. I think I will be returning this one and put back the older one."
5,Love It!,I purchased this about a year ago. I have loved it ever since. I have not had one problem with it. I would buy this product many times over.
2,not real great,"pretty cheap, but what would you expect for $25. I just ordered a hand-held shower (DELTA) for our new master bath and that one cost over $200 and is all metal. This Waterpik is plastic and broke when we tightened it."
4,"Works well, looks nice, priced right","We recently purchased this showerhead to replace our much more expensive Peerless showerhead that was always leaking. So far we haven't had any problems with this one. The brushed nickel finish looks really nice but it's not solid metal. It is plastic that is coated to look like brushed nickel. It has a 5-foot hose and 5 unique spray settings. The spray settings are full-body spray, slow-massaging pulse,fast-massaging pulse, combo massage + spray and misting spray. It also has flow regulators that you can install or remove depending on how much water flow that you like. It only takes 2 or 3 minutes to install but I would recommend using some thread tape to help reduce the chance of leakage. The showerhead is protected by a lifetime warranty."
2,Not as good as old model.,The spray force is too low even with the low flow device removed and the hose is a foot shorter than my old Waterpik which lasted ten years till the hose broke.Not a happy camper with the newer model.
3,disappointing,"I was disappointed that my favorite setting on the shower massage was not on this model. You can't really get a forceful stream, even after removing the water saver device. On the ""original waterpik"", if you chose the center stream it was definitely stronger than the other options, but not on this model. I'm not satisfied with it, and will probably buy a different model. However, my daughters didn't really mind the lack of pressure as much as I did."
5,Worth Buying .......,Well worth the price. Glad I chose this one that matches the rest of the brushed nickel decorations in this bathroom. :)
4,Waterpik,Good product for the price. One thing that should be made stronger is the piece that gets screwed into the wall pipe - it is weak and very wrench-unfriendly
3,ok for the price,"This is fine for a guest bathroom or outdoor shower for muddy kids, just not for everyday showers. The water settings are either a pulse jet or a rain cloud that goes around you. The cord is shorter than I would like and have had before. Does not seem to sit well in it's holder and I am usually trying to re direct the water."
4,good,"The shower head is fine, it doesn't have much pressure though. It has several different settings and looks nice and the hose works well."
1,junk,hose is gray not chrome had to us channelocks to tighten fittings to stop leaks bought delta same price install was a breeze you would think waterpix would be a good product cause they make so many showerheads
3,"""water pause"" setting defective","Seems to work fine except for one thing: instead of turning the water flow off or to a trickle, the ""water pause"" setting sprays a fine spray in many directions, including up. So it's useless. I assume this is a manufacturing defect, but it's a pain to return stuff so I'm not sure whether I will send it back or not. Sigh.On second thought, other reviewers here may be correct, that this product simply has no ""water pause"" setting."
2,Worst Luck Maybe?,"Well I've purchased one of these, and in the first week, it sprung a head leak. Took it back, got another, the very next day... almost the same thing. Now for the record, I'm about as gentle on this thing as can be. Maybe the worst luck, but I will not be returning this one for anything but a refund. :("
2,poor quality product,"I could not believe that within a couple of months the shower head was leaking on the sides of its threads. And yesterday the holder for shower head broke on its side.... I mean the one side of U shape piece that holds the head, broke down. Interestingly in the other bathroom I have a Kohler head which is still in action for last 7 years.So much for Waterpik for me. no more...."
1,Save your money!,"No water pressure at all, and I had GREAT water pressure before installing. And my water bill was $25.00 more than it usually is."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","This was my first and very likely my last book by Delia Parr. ... it is interesting to note that there are only two reviews for this book, so what does that say for it????? Why would poor Jane even consider marrying the man she did?? Couldn't she see his character since she had so many good qualities??? This was such a boring book, I cannot even continue. Sorry, folks. I'm sure no one will ever see this."
5,Well done!,"A good book for single women of any age. I read it when I was 19 and still find it applicable today. For any woman feeling down that there is no man in her life, and most women can admit to that without shame, these words are refreshing and uplifting. They highlight the joys of singleness--yes there are joys! This book helped me realize that, as well as reclaim my independence and my value as a single women. There are few things God can use as much as a willing, single woman. Read it!"
5,Good read for a Single Christian Lady,"I have developed a group of single women to focus on the teachings of this book and workbook. So far it has been a wonderful blessing for all of us. We have learned about one another as well as a deeper understanding for the Lord. I now know that I must devote my trust, faith, and patience to the Lord before I can reveal these qualities to my Godly man. A lady in waiting comforts your mind and inspires you to become all the characters it describes. The more you read, the more you desire to become a ""Lady In Waiting."""
2,I dread having to read the next chapter,"Our group is going through this book and at chapter 8 I have read enough to form a solid opinion. I wish I liked this book and the accompanying workbook, but it's really bad.The writing is condescending, overwraught (""your heavenly fiance"" and ""your knight in shining armour""), simplistic and repetitive.If you are looking for a bible study book, keep looking. If you want an excellent book on love relationships, I recommend C.S. Lewis' The four loves."
4,what a 14-year-old thinks,"I first herd of Lady in Waiting from a close friend who was a christian. After reading it, i found a closer spirtual relationship with God. I recomend this book for anyone with questions, for those who need help, and those looking for friends. i have since bought multiple copies to give to all my friends. they too enjoy it."
2,Good for teens and early 20s - a little much for older women,"A lot of what was brought out, I have heard in the past. So, as a teenager or early 20s when you haven't heard a lot of the ""single"" talks, you will get a lot of insight from this book. It also helps to let you know that you can have a full life even as a single woman. Good Bible base, but several of the Ruth examples used, I felt were a little far fetched."
5,Three Chord Salvation Hoedown...,"My Modern Lover's collection will often sit untouched for months on end but when I dig them back out they don't leave my CD player for weeks.This album captures everything the Modern Lover's stood for. The essential piece on this disc is ""A Plea for Tenderness"". Call me a bizzare case but that song that may sound like a bunch of unstructured noise to anybody else brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it.When Jonathan begins pleading, he sounds like he's really breaking down from desperation.Jonathan's constant pleas of ""play softer"" and the bands obvious desire to not comply with his wishes give you a look into the reasons this truly unique band dissolved but it also makes for highly entertaining listening.In my view this is hands down the best live recording of any rock band ever, mainly because it's not about perfection. it's about sincerity and the freedom music can give you to be your own person."
5,Incredible Live Album!,"The Modern Lovers sound great on this 70 minute live album. In this album, you can really hear the Velvet Underground influence. They even do a great cover of the song Foggy Notion, that was virtually unknown at the time. Precise Modern Lovers Order has some of the best songs from their incredible first album, such as Someone I Care About, Hospital, Girlfriend, Pablo Picasso, I'm Straight and Roadrunner. All these songs are done just as good as the album, if not better. It also include other great songs, such as Womanhood, Ride On Down The Highway, Fly Into The Mystery and A Plea For Tenderness. Overall, this is a great live album displaying the early Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. A must for fans."
2,"poor sound quality, ragged performance","unless you are a big, big jonathan richman fan you can skip this cd. the sound quality of the cd is poor. it's probably a cleaned up bootleg tape. that's what it sounds like. the performance itself is out of tune and ragged (as ernie brooks' cd booklet notes admit). it's beyond me how ANYONE could think this is richman's best album. so, unless you are a BIG, BIG fan i'd advise sticking to the MODERN LOVERS one great studio album (produced by john cale). that's without a doubt jonathan richman's best album. ""JONATHAN SINGS!"" from 1983 (with a very different modern lovers) is another great jonathan richman album (cd). if you don't have it, get that one instead of this. it's jonathan's second best."
4,Good first HDTV,"Overall this is a solid TV. Sound could be better, the hidden bottom speakers don't have a good sound quality. But that's what a home theater system is for. Nice, rich and clear picture. Simple elegent design. The only issue with this TV that I have is that the aspect ratio for real widescreen is 16:9, this is 16:10 which stretches the image vertically to fit the screen. I hoped that it would just get cut off on the sides. It's not really noticable though. Great introduction for first time LCD/HDTV buyers."
4,Good TV but no Digital Tuner as listed,"There is no digital tuner built in like Amazon says. I did my research before I bought this and knew it didn't have it before I spent the money because the price was about $100 less than Best Buy or Circuit City. The TV is nice looking. I also have the 32"" in my living room. That one has the digital tuner built-in."
5,Samsung LN-S1951W LCD TV,Easy to install. Excellent picture and sound quality. Just the right size for our kitchen.
4,Nice Stool,"Pros:Cushion colorFold down easily for storageSturdyComfortableMulti-purpose usesGood initial height for most users (5ft 8 and under) - see below for height adjustmentCons:I am not sure if raises and lowers -- I don't believe it does -- if it does, it is not easy to figure out"
5,good-bye stinch,"I recommend this product to anyone. I knew of this product while working in a hospital. I purchased it to remove stinch from my home and car. It removes the hardest and blatant of all smells: fart, vomit smell, ciggarette stinch, rotten food left under a car seat."
4,"great product, slow delivery","The product was exactly as advertised, and what I wanted however I paid 30 some dollars for expedited shipping and it took over 2 weeks to recieve luckily I did recieve it in time for xmas."
4,Now I know where my dog is!,"I don't hunt, but I hike with my dog. Being a bird dog, she instinctively runs far from me, and I was always afraid I wouldn't find her.The Astro is very easy to use, which is great for a dog tracking novice like me. The compass screen points to where she is and how far away, and the map shows the routes we're both taking. There is a lot more information, like the distance she's traveled, her average speed and plenty of other things that I haven't figured out yet. Every time I use it I find something new. The best thing about it is that I don't worry if I don't see her. I love it!The only problem I have had with it was a broken antenna, but it was easy and not too expensive to replace."
2,"Not a great movie, but interesting anyway.","It is a given that this movie is not the same type of movie that Scott Glenn did previous to it. Then again, not many movies can't compare to ""Silence of the Lambs."" After the first 15 minutes or so this movie becomes a lot better. Once Glenn finds himself on the Navajo Indian Reservation he becomes the typical fish out of water type character as he looks to return to Los Angeles with a suspected murderer, much like Val Kilmer's FBI character in ""Thunderheart."" Even that movie is far and above better than ""Shadow Hunter,"" but do not let this discourage you. It is a good rental, and you may never watch it again, but the mystical aspect of Native-American culture will suck you in. Enjoy!"
1,Wasn't right to be made!!,"This movie is not to be seen if you don't have a respectful mind. I,a native that comes from the Dineh(Navajo)Nation do not think this was appropiate to make for money or for any reason at all. It's very desrespectful to Indigenous People and most importantly to our elderly ones, that have suffered the most,to find out that we'd let something like this happen."
2,Save your money,"Once again Grateful Dead Productions produces a release where the bonus material trumps the main body of work. Why not release all of the 1987 performance?? The energy in Hey Pocky Way alone eclipses all of 6/16/90. The bonus material shows the Dead full of energy , playing with zeal and having fun and this is what we love to SEE and seeing how this is a VIEW from the vault you would think that would play into what they choose to release. If you want to see the Grateful Dead as you remember them then this is worth it for the bonus material only . If you want to see the Grateful Dead as your friends or relatives who ""dont get it"" saw them, then watch the 1990 material."
2,lackluster...,"A decent setlist is ruined by a lackluster performance and a subpar audio/lead vox mic job. The jam/space bit is quite good, though. Caveat emptor...."
3,"Very good show, cheesy special effects","Viewed as a live music video, the 'psychedelic' special effects go more than overboard and seemed amateurish. So as a whole video, i just give it 3 stars. Without the added effects, I would have rated this a 5.I found that the special effects would start just about the same time i was getting into the 'space' of the song, so I guess in some ways it was right on cue. Unfortuately, the distraction took me out of my mental and spiritual space.I wondered if Monterey Video could have offered these DVD in dual format, giving we, the viewer, the option of watching or not watching the special effects."
5,Neat ideas,This magazine had a lot of really neat ideas in it. I really like this group of books by Primedia.
3,I just have one question...,"If the spirits pass through physical objects--walls, tables, people's bodies, etc.--unable to touch them except through special acts of concentrated willpower, WHY DON'T THEY GO THROUGH FLOORS??? How come they walk normally on the ground and floors and streets?Just wondering.Fairly enjoyable movie. Parts of it are very enjoyable. But parts are pretty sappy and gushy with emotion--too much."
5,Heavenly,"Romantic and beautifully shot.........warm, rich, and kind - to those of uswho know - the kingdom of God is within us,if I proclaim it - it will be mine.All love is of GOD, all love that is sanctified.Very moving, but not for children -at all."
5,Gives a whole new meaning to seeing ghosts.,"Ever see toasters flying through the air from everywhere? Ever see penny's rise floor up the side of a door? Ever sees ghosts of ex's (from Texas, sorry had to add that to make it rhyme). Ever see a pillow find an armadillo? Okay so you won't find all that in this movie. Hey, I can't give it all away right? But you will find some of it.Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore (2 of my favorite actors) were absolutely great in this movie! It is very heartwarming, very funny, sometimes very weird and some times maybe violent. So you should probably not have the kiddos in the room. But it is a definate must see, it has a different variety of scenes in and I think that is one of the things that makes the movies so good. Of course Whoopi Goldberg makes it all that much better!!Ditto..."
4,Pretty good flick,"Hadn't seen this film for well over a decade until this afternoon. The story is quite engaging and Whoopi Goldberg really steals the show in (arguably) her last great role. Patrick Swayze is believable however Demi Moore is just awful. Can the girl do anything in this movie except cry? And that song, Unchained Melody...arghh! It makes me ears bleed!"
3,The only good dude is a dead dude?,"Almost everyone will find something to like about this film, but other parts can really get your knickers in a twist.Despite having heard the tune for years previously, I didn't really like ""Unchained Melody"" until it was featured in the movie. There are many surprises here...Demi's unusually convincing performance, Whoopi telling us about traffic patterns in the spirit world (""I got spooks comin' in from Jersey!""), Swayze developing his telekinetic powers with the help of the ""subway ghost"". Yet there is also Whoopi's annoying ad lib attempts at humor, the uninspired ""afterlife"" special effects, and the uncomfortable subtext of the plot...that Demi loves the Swayze character even more now that he's deceased (shudder). The theologically inclined will get to weigh in on how the court system in the afterlife would rule on a ""revenge killing"" plea. Hey, and if this necrophiliac spook-infested romp really is a good movie for Valentine's Day, heaven help us all!"
1,Ghost,"I triedTo watch this movie six or seven times. It would not stream for me. I worked with amazon to resolve this problem, it did not work. I cancelled amazon prime."
4,good movie for romantics with humor,If you are a romantic with good humor and like a love story with a bit of a twist then you will love this movie.
4,what can I say?,a classic to see that haunts you even after it has long been played.Yes I di d enjoy thi s movie.
5,GREAT MOVIE,"Great movie, love it bunches. Purchased it for a gift. Arrived quicker than expected and was well packaged for protection."
2,Maybe a good film for Catholics,"Speaking as a Protestant,I can't say that I agree with the concept of this film.Most of it is based more on Catholic kind of beliefs.So if you're a Catholic...enjoy.But,if you're a born-again Christian Protestant like me,you'll probally wouldn't like this neither."
4,Ghost. A girls movie.,A girls movie with some action for the guys. I added this to my collection toreplace the VHS version.
5,Amazon has what I want,"This movie, as all the books and everything ordered, came promptly and is a good price. Always great service."
4,First Date Movie,"I saw this movie on a first date 10 years ago. I had no idea that the movie was going to wind up changing the way I looked at life, death and relationships. As contrived as some people found it, I thought it to be poignant and heartwrenching. I have been very careful in my relationships with loved ones to be sure and tell them, ""I Love You"", because as this movie pointed out... You truly never know when the one you love will be yanked mercilessly away from you. Most of us will never get a second chance to utter those words once our loved one is gone.... But OH!! Imagine if we did? I think that is why this movie did so well. It touched on raw human emotion and basic human need. It will remain one of my all time favorites. A bittersweet film that to this day can make me weep."
4,Loved The Movie,Ghost in blue-ray was perfect.The item arrived as stated new and in excellent condition as seller said.
3,Bought for a gift.,The wife loves the movie. Nothing different from the movie so if you want it on DVD it is OK.
5,Demi Moore!,Now I remember why I always loved Demi Moore! This is a great movie; my wife & I both had tears in our eyes.
2,This is a great movie but....,"...the DVD information indicates that the audio is in spanish; however, after I received it I have realized that it is not including this audio option.I think Amazon should review the information for the movies to indicate only the real options, this way one can be sure about the purchase."
2,"Rather better than some, but not well","This movie has all the ingredients for a truly beautiful movie, but they just never mix. I'm quite a fan of the ""Ghostly/Eternal love"" theme, but this movie just can't compare with the great movies of that genre such as Always, A guy named joe and the best of them all, Gene Tierney, and Rex Harrison's The Ghost an Mrs. Muir (1947)"
2,A fine time to be ladylike,"Whoopi Cushion, uh, Goldberg, is very funny in GHOST. But beyond Whoopi, the film's entertainment value plummets. Why? Demi Moore's character is so darn stupid! The scene that blew it for me: Demi stands there in frozen panic watching the murder of her boyfriend, played by Patrick Swayze. You won't even run for help, Dummy, uh, Demi? Just hang around gawking as Patrick gets killed! It reminded me of those ""Superman"" episodes where thugs beat up Jimmy Olsen while Lois Lane stood there like a wax figure. Women!"
3,It was..ok?,"I don't understand what the big deal about this movie is, it's predictable and plain stupid at times."
2,average then&now,this film is very average.the story takes on more than it has answers for.it hasn't aged well at all.Demi Moore&Patrick Swayze have no real Chemistry.also Demi is a weak actress&Swayze is a Average actor at best.Whoopi Goldberg gets a Toekn Appearence&Award for this so/so film.
2,A tremendous disappointment,I remember when the trailers first came out I was so excited that what appeared to be a beautiful romance was soon on it's way.To give Whoopi Goldberg a best supporting actress award for this trite and juvenile performance in lieu of her absolutely monumental portrayal of Celie in The Color Purple is to me just a reflection of the stupidity and superficiality of the viewing public and the academy in general.The film was incredibly predictable and not particulary romantic. If you want to view a quality fanciful romance I suggest that you check out Somewhere in Time with Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve.
4,among my favorites,Great movie with a special cast. Patrick and Whoopi have special chemistry very rarely seen in movies.
5,One of the Best Movies of All Time,"This movie has a little everything that will appeal to just about everyone. There's plenty of comedy, lots of romance, a bit of action and suspense and a more or less happy, tear-jerker ending. Not to mention the beauty of a young Demi Moore. And as a plus, the paranormal aspect gets plausible treatment. If you haven't seen this, I say you 'must'. Go out and buy it to watch over and over."
3,Movie review,"I enjoyed a lot more the first time I watched it. I was a lot younger and more interested in the romance, Patrick Swayzee and the music. This time I realized how corny it was with the evil ghouls taking the bad guys away. Patrick Swazee was cute but couldn't act. Whoopie Goldberg was really funny as usual and made the movie tolerable."
5,Favorite Movie,"The Harper Trading SystemThis movie is a beautiful love story embracing life after death. It is funny, with Whoopi Goldberg really adding a lot of laughs, balancing he sad, scary and violent content. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore never really get over the top pathetic, uncomfortable or cloying - just seems to hit the right note always. The Blu Ray adaptation seems excellent also, as is the sound quality."
4,This is a wonderful ghost movie. Diddo to that.,"This is a terrific movie mixed with romance, comedy, action, drama, and suspense. Patrick Swayze stars as a banker who is suddenly murdered by an armed thug, thus leaving his poor girlfriend (Demi Moore) behind. Patrick is now a ghost who must solve the true reason to why he was murdered. By doing so, he uses the aid of a psychic (Whoopie Goldberg) to help him warn his sweetheart of a similar fate. The crimes are hard edged, the cast is awesome, the special effects are cool, and Whoopie Goldberg is howlingly funny. Buy this movie if you've never seen it. If you like collecting movies, then don't bother to resist and add this to your collection. This is a true classic.NOTE: This movie is rated PG-13, but contains a ton of profanity, including violence and a sex scene."
1,Excellent,I cant believe all the people who are slamming this movie for bad acting or miscasting. Its a wonderful movie and demi moore and patrick swayze do great.Whoopi gives her oscar winning performance in force as a psychic who helps the ghostly swayze avenge his murder.I couldnt believe the user who commented that they wish they could go back in time and recast with nicole kidman and jason patric as the leads -WRONG . now that would be moronic recasting esp jason patric ? who the hell is he? some beverly hills 90210 punk and nicole kidman would not pass for the sweatshirt type woman period. great movie ignore the naysayers
1,Pure treacle,"This is an embarrassing movie. The plot is hackneyed, one big cliche after another. The acting just insipid.Don't get me wrong. I'm a fairly romantic guy. This movie doesn't do it It's just dreadful. Somebody, please, make Patrick Swayze go away.If you want to see a great romantic movie that features lost lovers returning from the grave to comfort and aid their enamoratta, check out the contemporaneous British film ""Truly, Madly, Deeply."""
1,this puts the terror in terrorble,"this whole movie was a mistake.its really a love story between demi moore who once played a lesbian and patrick swayzee who dresses up like a girl and dances.one of them gets killed.its ol pat and then whoopi goldberg lets them make out and god knows what else using her medium body.itll probably scare the kids.there are no sequels thank god.i dont understand how anybody could like this movie.its stupid.its emotional if you forgot your meds.theres 2 chicks.demi moore whose rather overated as a sex symbol and the extremely racist and hateful whoopi goldberg whose not at all attracvtive.on a up note,all whoopis movies are worse.all patricks movies are worse and demis got gi jane and a small part in batman returns that outrank this autrocity."
4,"""Great Thriller That's One Of Patrick's Best!""","Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg star in this 1990 thriller.A murdered man's spirit tries to save his girlfriend with a psychic's help.This is a great film and I think it's one of Patrick's best. This dvd hasnice picture and sound plus some neat extras. I recommend this."
5,Great Movie,Love this movie and the Blu-Ray makes it even better. Sharper picture and colors. Anyone who is a die hard Patrick Swayze fan will love this one for their collection.
5,bevb,Love Patrick Swayze. This movie is a classic love story. Good family entertainment. Get a bowl of popcorn and just enjoy.
2,Sounds and Songs of the Humpback Whales,"This cd was a very good price and I feel now that I got what I paid for (2.98) and regret not having paid more for a better recording. I can hear mistakes in the repetition of the whale sounds and the whale sounds do not sound natural in rhythm. They seem to continue too frequently within a repeated loop. Also, there are some parts where a sound was started and then quickly stopped, then started again. With earphones on I am sensitive to these kinds of sounds and hear the mistakes. In addition, the surf is quite loud. That is fine, except that my mind is on the surf at that moment and then I hear deep water sounds of whales which take me to the deep sea. Am I on the beach or listening to whales in the sea? For listeners who are especially critical, and want to hear convincingly natural sounds don't bother buying this cd. For those who are not particular and just want to hear general ""sea sounds"" it might be ok for a good deal."
4,Very Relaxing,"Sent and Arrived fast. Still in orginal packaging. Listen to it just about every night, very soothing and relaxing. Good buy for anybody that find it hard to sleep in silence. I like it alot but, I wish it would play different whale sounds it just sounds like the same clip on loop. But other than that its very soothing."
5,Rock-a-By Humpack,"This cd is the gentlest, smoothest, most soothing piece of natural orchestral compositions that have ever graced my ears in my life. I play this for my various children and they all agree: humpback whales have got it. Humpbacks clearly show their superiority to the orcas, whose cd fell quite short in their attempt to outsell these gems. Although they show some similarities, the humpbacks show a peculiar sensitivity to the ears of foreign species. My children, and may I say, myself included, appreciate that more than anything. Orcas need to learn this lesson. This cd is great!"
5,Sounds and Songs of the Humpback WhalesI,"The most calming album I have ever listened to. I am and infant teacher and I play this music or should I say songs of the whales in my room. I find that after listening to childrens songs for about 30 min. my infants get restless and when I put on the Whales they calm, the coo, they smile and if they are crying they calm faster."
2,weak,"I was not impressed with this book. It is short (140 pages of large print). It lacks detail. It is simply a rehashing of some basic facts of the War in South Carolina. It appears more like a college term paper written by someone who read ""The Road to Guilford Courthouse"" than a well researched book from a College Professor. I read ""The Road to Guilford Courthouse"" only a few weeks before reading ""Partisans and Redcoats"". Believe me, ""The Road"" is much, much better (only lacks maps..but otherwise very good). For someone in middle/elementary school or possibly high school Edgars work might prove satisfying. Perhaps someone with a limited interest in history might find it useful too. That is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Get ""The Road"" instead."
3,I'm of two minds about this book,"On the one had this book is written in an engaging manner and got me interested in a topic I knew little about. The book gives a good background on the Revolutionary war in South Carolina.However after describing the beginnings of partisan warfare the book kind of tapers off. It does not really go into Kings Mountain, Guilford courthouse, or why the British tried to move north into Virginia. In fact the book does not really cover events outside of South Carolina. Maybe that was the scope of the book. But if that was the case, the scope was too small. Upon finishing the book I had a dissatisfied feeling. It was almost like missing the end of a movie. I was interested in the story and wanted to see it all the way to the end. Instead it stopped three quarters of the way through."
3,Too short,"Edgar is a good writer and the book is an easy read, but trying to explain the complex motives, personalities, and actions involved in the Carolina war is too much for such a small volume. If you want a basic understanding of that part of the Revolutionary War, read Buchanan's ""The Road to Guilford Courthouse"" instead. Or if you have time, read Edgar for a quick overview, then Buchanan for more depth."
4,Engaging..a different perspective,"I found this book to be quite enjoyable. It looks at the American Revolution from a different perspective than most books I have come across, examining the war from a distinctly southern viewpoint. I found two themes to be of particular note in this work. First, the author describes how the many people not inclined to support the Revolution were driven to by the actions of the British troops sent to crack down on the revolt in the early part of the war. Secondly, the sheer brutality of war in the 1700s was brought to life (often using contemporary accounts). Much of the fighting was hand-to-hand and atrocities were committed with regularity on both sides on levels hard for the modern reader to comprehend. It was a very interesting book and well worth reading."
3,A good brief introduction,"This book was an excellent introduction to a small facet of the American revolution. It does fall short in a standard American way when it comes to history - it is myopic, with no apparent understanding of why Britain lost the war - but it was entertaining.Be a little aloof when reading it, though - the author is bombastic and does not hold back on espousing his personal views, sometimes unfortunately mixing them with cold facts."
4,"A good read, if brief","I found this book to be both enjoyable and informative, however it was also brief and at times confusing.This book covers the battles between the backcountry forces and the British and allies from the fall of Charlestown until the battle of cowpens.I would recomend this, however it seems both a bit short and the authors writing style confused me about the timeline a bit, however the timeline in the back and the maps of the battles made it all make sense!"
5,TOTALLY NECESSARY FOR WESTERN STUDIES.,"This book names the forts, presidios, and posts west of the Mississippi River to 1898, and not only does the author give the location but he gives some historical facts. If I had the money, I would take this book, get me a good travel map and visit each of the places mentioned! Last month I went to several Texas forts, an old Presidio and an Arizona fort. The book was invaluable!"
3,An excellent listing of forts,"As one commentator wrote, this book does not give the history of the military of the west, but that was not its design. If you are looking for information on forts to act as a source to further your investigation, this is a good book to help you locate the forts, camps, et cetera, of the army in the west.For over all history, nothing beatsFrontier Regulars: The United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891andFrontiersmen in Blue: The United States Army and the Indian, 1848-1865. Frazer's work acts as a good addendum to other books that deal with the detail of combat and history."
3,Great for On The Job reference but doesn't cut it for Exam,"Just passed my exam with 88% and it wasn't because of this book. The book does a great job of explaining in detail about add-on products such as Unix Integration and IMS but only the basics are covered on the test. Oh, the first thing that you should do is throw away the CD. About 10% of the questions on the CD are inaccurate and copletely contradict the same questions in the book. Also two topics were not covered in the book such as domain trust relationships and profile/policies relationships which the exam spends quite a great deal on. Bottom line, if you want this for job reference get it, if you want to pass the exam get the Exam Cram series"
5,Very good read for CCA,"This book does a very good job of both preparing you for the CCA exam as well as serving as a referencing for simple Citrix MetaFrame installations. Typical 'exam crams' can provide enough information to pass an exam, but are of little use afterwards. This is one book you can put on a reference shelf at the office.Citrix is a increasingly popular solution and this book will be all you need to pass the exam.."
2,Average Book-Unorganized and CD is useless,"The study guide was mediocre. Poorly organized which detracts from the info that it has. The CD is useless. The exam on it has so many errors as to make it unreliable. At least 4 times I found questions where the explanation of the correct answer completely contradicted what they were saying was the correct answer. One question asked which OS could be used in a certain scenario and gave choices of Dos 6.0, Win95, Unix and Win3.1 and gave the correct answers as WIN95 and Win3.1 but the explanation of the answer stated that only Win95, 98, NT4 and Windows For Workgroups could be used. Win3.1 IS NOT WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS. That's Win3.11."
3,Not so good for exam,"Although the material in the book is useful and similar to the Citrix training course, it is not really focused that well on the actual CCA exam. In particular, the exam questions (while of value in learning the product) should not be used as your sole test prep. If the book did not advertise itself as a test prep, it would get a higher rating from me, but it does not really do what it promises. Please note that I am a CCEA, CCA & CCI, familiar with Citrix tests."
5,Fantastic western,"Although westerns are not as popular as they used to be, this past decade or so has seen some extremely well-made ones: Tombstone, Lonesome Dove, Unforgiven, Dances With Wolves, Conagher, & Streets of Laredo. Add to that list this remarkable film, written by Larry McMurtry (of Lonesome Dove et al) Tom Berenger (Rough Riders, Gettysburg, Avenging Angel) is one of the most under-rated actors of today, and here is able to fall into an excellent portrayal fo a 19th century cowboy. As noted in the Amazon review, the cinematography is enthralling, which just adds to the over-all feel of the western period."
2,Disappointing quasi-historical Western from Hallmark,"The Johnson County War is a great subject for an authentic Western, and Hallmark's track record (plus Larry McMurtry's pen) would seem to bode well for this production. Unfortunately it's not very good, despite magnificent scenery and adequate performances by Tom Berenger & Michelle Forbes. Rachel Ward steals her few brief scenes, but Burt Reynolds's acting is almost as garish as his face lift. If 60 of its 180 tiresome, cliche-ridden minutes were cut, it might make an above-average made-for-TV movie, but even that drastic snooze-factor reduction would fail to rescue it from mediocrity among theatrical releases."
2,Just about worthless,"Larry McMurtry should be lynched for writing this non-event. On and on it goes, interminably. It could have been 90 minutes long, and actually been worth watching. But because the network had to have as many commercial breaks as possible, they crammed a 90 minute story into 180 minutes. What a disappointment!"
2,"Not terrible, not great","This is a very uneven movie, especially from an acting standpoint. Tom Berenger and Luke Perry have moments in which they seem to be asleep while acting, but then are just fine at other points. Burt Reynolds is woefully miscast. Adam Storke and Michelle Forbes are fine throughout, though. As for the story, it is a mishmash of just about every Western cliche you can think of, none of which pay off very well, as the movie comes to a flat conclusion. Still, there are occasional flashes of inspiration, so if you're a die-hard fan of either Westerns or writer Larry McMurtry (who adapted the screenplay), then this might be worth a look."
3,Beautiful scenery and a good story.,"It's decent but not outstanding. There is not a lot of action until the end if you are looking for that. There is a persistent love triangle that continues through the film which could have been left out. It doesn't include any type of constant skimishing to indicate the ongoing struggle but rather just culminates in the final shootout. Also ,the final shootout has the representiave small time rancher holed up instead of the other way around as history actually went. That's forgiveable I guess. The film essentially takes a small number of people(namely three brothers and some friends) and tries to be a microcasm of the overall struggle between the greedy cattle barons and the small time rancher. The greedy barons are portrayed pretty well but the english one in particular is just a little over the top. So if you're a die hard western fan you'll probably like it, ..."
5,Johnson County War,I found this film to be in the same class as Lonesome Dove - it was totally enthralling and I was sorrywhen it finished.
2,Cute I guess...but doesn't make much sense...,"This movie is o.k. for little kids, but in many ways doesn't make much sense. The Goblin's have a werid weakness for they way they live and you would think they would do something about it. Also the king and his men are pretty stupid considering what is going on...watch the movie you'll see. But I would recommend something like Spirited Away, what a great movie.Take care and wear some thick shoes...you'll see...Sam"
2,About the condition of this item.......,"I bought this movie for my daughter who had one when she was younger and it has somehow disappeared. She loves the story, characters, and music in the film. The thing I have issues with is the condition of the item. It was clumsily wrapped in plastic, the case is damaged and yellowed. If you are buying this as a gift, don't expect it to look new as it definitely doesn't. Since I purchased this as a Christmas gift, I went ahead and opened it to examine the film. It looks fine and plays properly; however, there are seven and one-half minutes of previews and COMMERCIALS at the beginning of the tape! I'm very disappointed with this purchase, but will keep it because I may not have time to order from somewhere else and receive it before Christmas."
3,Probably not as good as the book,"I admit I did not read the book, but I suspect that this movie falls far short of the McDonald fairy tale classic. My son really likes this movie though so I can't trash it altogether. It must have some kid appeal, although I am not sure what."
1,I am disappointed,"This is the most highly uncreative childrens movie I have been able to accuratly view. The animated fell short of Stupid, and the musial portion of the movie, made you want to crack your head open to get it over with sooner. All in all the movie was the kind that would drive you to want to get hit by a car. However it is amusing to make fun of the names...."
3,OK Movie; but Cool Cat!,"My kids loved it, so I recomend it with children who are under 10, I DID like the Goblins' devil blue cat however. The animation with him was pretty neat, I also liked the part when the princess stroked him in her sleep mistaking him for her cat, while he purred with delight, (I am a devoted cat lover) otherwise it's a cute show for the kids on a rainy day."
4,beautiful,"Ashland is a great little town, i visited there when i was a kid with my grandfather, he really liked the Ashland shakespear festival. the content of the dvd was quite interesting with beautiful footage and great narration. Just like i remember it what a great job. thank you"
4,DVD makes you want to visit,"I was looking for somewhere to go for vacation and bought this DVD because Oregon is one of the States I have never been to. I could not believe how beautiful Ashland is. This DVD shows the Shakespeare Festival, Lithia Park and so much more. This DVD also some has just beautiful footage of nature and is so intersting."
4,"Nice travel video about Ashland, Oregon","I'm glad they came out with a video on Ashland, it's a beautiful place with so much to offer. This video provides views of nature, the Shakespeare Festival, and Lithia Park. If you are into traveling in America, you will want to consider going there. My physical condition keeps me from traveling but I had to see this video after my friend told me about her visit there. Along with the sights, there is an interesting narration to keep you company."
1,An absurd production,"I bought 3 of these to give out at our family reunion, give folks out east a taste of 'back home'. Not only were the movies tacky and tourist-driven (i.e. didn't give a feeling of the town at all) but production values were HORRIBLE. Entire film seemed an amateur affair. Will not be making the mistake of buying from this line ever again."
2,Seems like a rough draft,"I really wanted to like this, but there are just too many faults. The video looks very much like something someone would make as a high school project. The script has some jarring grammatical errors and the narration doesn't match up with the scenes much of the time (e.g. talking about wildlife while showing video of cows). Plus, the same shots are shown over and over (deer, ducks, etc.). All that being said, if you want a video about Ashland this is the one to get since I don't think there are any others. It's a beautiful town that needs a professional video that does it justice."
5,Great movie!,"I was very impressed with the beautiful footage in this film. I am a nature person and when I saw the deer, I felt like I was at home!"
4,I'm for the Hippopotamus,"I'm laughing just thinking about this movie. You have to have a particular sense of humor, but this movie is a classic Bud Spencer, Terrace Hill adventure. With slow dry situational humor, a environmental protection theme while helping the less fortunate in a quirky sort of way, it's a complete riot.There is no high definition, and the sound is done on the cheap, but you soon adjust and a great time is had."
4,Not that bad if you give it a chance.,"I would rather have given this a 3.5 star rating. But since that wasn't available I went with 4 because I'm a big fan of Shu Qi. Alas, her part isn't as big as I had hoped. The action is pretty good and the fight scenes are nice too until the very end, When the laws of physics and gravity are somewhat ignored. The villian(who has a vast following)I thought was nicely done, but for some reason shows up in an obscure little European country that, also for some strange reason is filled with a lot of chinese also. Another problem I had with this film is the notion that whoever took part in Tiananmen Square betrayed thier country. If anything I think they were trying to save it."
2,Not impressed,"This is the second title from Punch! that I have purchased and I have finally learned my lesson. The graphics on the box are great, but they mislead you into thinking that this is easy to use and has a lot of functionality. I found that I could not do very precise measurements; on the plus side, it does a fair job for landscape layout and you can get a general idea of what your deck might look like pretty quickly. I know this is not much of a review and it probably lacks information, but that's the same feeling I get from Punch! Home Design and Deck and Landscape Design."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this product with the expectations of being able to design & build my deck. The package certainly leads you to believe you can do this. The manual and tutorial are also weak. After spending about 6 hours trying to design my deck using the 2D plan format, I found the software doesn't even give you an estimate of materials or building details. It does open up to a spreadsheet telling you how many posts you'll need, but that's it. This product was a waste of money.I sure miss the ""Books that Work"" series on ""How to Design & Build Your Deck."" It was limited in designs you could build, but it was focused on deck building and included how-to pictures and would provide a detailed plan with a complete bill of materials."
1,I recommend a pencil instead,"Home design software should have both flash and substance. Unfortunately, Punch! is only flash. You can put together a nice cartoon of your vision but you can forget about getting any useful blueprints or material lists or even getting the precise design you want. I was looking for a product that could produce the drawings I need to get the go-ahead for my deck from the building commission. Instead I was able only to get a rough layout of my deck. I say rough because Punch restricts you to a handful of basic designs and shapes. The most unfortunate fact is that all of PUNCH's competitors seem to have fallen away so it's either PUNCH or a pencil. I recommend the pencil."
3,Punch! Ultimate Deck and Landscape,This software was okay. It was fairly easier than others similar to it. It did not do what we wanted. We knew the size deck that we wanted but we wern't sure about the supports and just how much lumber we needed. I wanted more of a blueprint program. I would recomend a book by Southern Living called Complete Deck Book. It had more instructions if you are a beginner. If you know what you are doing then you don't need this software.
1,Don't waste your money,I just bought Punch deck design. You would expect that it would be taylored to designing decks. Guess again. It is nothing more than a simple cad program with a few deck related overlays. You must build multiple decks to create a single mult-tiered deck. It does nothing with deck supports or even patterns of wook on the deck. Stairs beyond a simple straight stair case forget it. DO NOT BUY this product. Get a piece of paper and ruler and you will be better off.
2,Punch Deck and Landscape,"I was very disappointed with the product and am going to send it back for refund. The first project I tried to do involved a shed with flat roof, and a large garden with 2 foot concrete wall around it. I was not allowed the option of flat roof or short concrete walls. So I tried fencing around it and only had 4 choices, none of which was concrete. This is no way to visualize your project. I am searching for a better landscaper."
1,DECK DRAFTING,"The only thing that I can say good about this product is that it has a nice live view. Other than that , I think the product is a waste of time buying. Now that I purchased this product from ""PUNCH"". I don't think I'll be puchasing anything else from them."
1,Far better ways to spend your money and your time,"I had low expectations to begin with but they were still too high. This program is just not up to the task - plain and simple. I spent several nights trying to get a two-tierred deck designed and have wasted my time struggling with this terrible product. If I hadn't borrowed this CD from a friend who also couldn't do any constructive work with it, I'd have demanded my money back. I beg someone to write a review who's HAS designed and built a deck with this toy; add a link so we can see what you actually accomplished. Its time to use something useful like AutoCad..."
4,Thought it was easy.,"I worked with it without reading any directions, so for this I give it a thumbs up. I do however wish I could have drawn a little more accurate with it (I am an autocad design/drafter) so if it would have been more autocad friendly that would have been nice. The only thing else I wish I could have done with the program, that I was unable to do, was design a screened in porch. The system allowed me to design a deck and an all weather room, but I could not get the look of a screened area. Overall I felt it was easy to use, teach and quick to design/redesign. The files take up very little space. I give it 4 out of 5 stars but have no other deck design program to compare it to, it is the only one I have ever tried."
3,Adequate enough to get an idea of what you want,"The software is not a CAD program, and it was probably never intended to be one. It will present you with an idea of what your project will look like ( a multi-tier deck in my case) and allow you to make multiple changes as your idea changes. Not difficult to use, it just takes a little patience."
1,Ultimately Not! Punch Out,"Deck design allows design of will/might look good, not what it takes to construct. No place to select joist size/spacing; type of footing; size and placement of cross beam(s), cross blocking or size of decking boards. I'll find a WIN98 machine and use 3D-Deck instead."
1,Not credible,"As many other reviewers have pointed out, the ""Celtic"" premise is ridiculously overblown. The Army of Northern Virginia can not be compared to the Scots at Culloden in 1745.Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, the book ignores many ""big picture"" issues that played into the outcome of the war. Better alternative reading would be ""Two Great Rebel Armies"" by McMurry or ""Why the South Lost"" by Hattaway and company."
5,A Supremely Scholarly Analysis,"Attempts to explain why the South lost the Civil War have been a crowded cottage industry since the war ended. Northern industrial might, excessive Southern democracy, poor political leadership, faulty economic support, have all had their advocates and periods of popularity. Attack and Die is a fresh appraoch to the question. The analysis of McWhiney and Jamieson combines a shrewd analysis of southern culture, changes in military technology between 1846 and 1861, with an impressive array of statistics to explain the Southern defeat as springing from their dependence on outmoded tactics that worked in the Mexican War but did not work fifteen years later. The reason: the change in that fifteen years from the musket to the rifle as the basic infantry weapon. Studies like this demonstrate that there is still a vast amount of material to be collected, analysed, and theorized upon about our Civil War."
4,Extraordinary insights into tactics of U.S. Civil War,"I am a novice Civil War buff and this book is packed with high quality information. The book impressed me at several levels - a good introduction into historical research, a compendium of ordered facts on the tactics of the Civil War, a credible journal of how the Confederacy was defeated, robust due to its surprise ending."
3,Amusing but version is cut,"This is a good and amusing B picture with a fine cast that can carry this kind of comedy well. But, and it is a big BUT:But it ends abruptly and is missing five minutes. It is not 90 min long, it is 57 min long - 5 short of the 62 min that it is supposed to run.Amazon should correct the length of this version. If there is any truth to the 90 min claim, it is the length of this cut film, plus the length of a ton of advertising that Alpha always puts on their DVDs."
1,Video Professor Scam,I ordered the Ebay course direct from the Video Professor. It was supposed to be free. In the fine print somewhere it apparently says you are signing up for a program a month. I had a terrible time getting my money back and the shipments stopped. It would not have happened without the help of the credit card company.
1,Buyer Beware,"When is Free not Free? Avoid this product, it's not free and your credit card will be charged once or multiple times for something advertised as free without further obligations."
1,video professor,My husband and I received some discs for computer classes in the mail and thought it was a promotion until we received our credit card bill. It was charged for over $300. I called our credit card company to cancel the order and found out another charge had been added that day for over $160. We never ordered anything from Video Professor and did even know anything about the company. We don't know how they acquired our credit card info. We had to cancel our credit card.Peggy
1,Company Uses Deceptive Marketing Practices,"I purchased a video professor program and was charged for a subscription service. I sincerely regret buying this software. I gave my copy away for its true value, free! Check the BBB for more information on Video Professor."
3,The professor is too fast,"I bought this for my mom who wanted to learn to use computers and the internet. she does not have a good background on computers and i thought this will help with the basics.i find that the professor talks too fast and my mom finds it hard to keep up so i continuously have to help her catch up. not that i mind anyway.besides that, the lessons are good for someone with no background. I would recommend to video professor to find a way for people to follow without been overwhelmed with the pace of the lecture."
5,To the point and easy to follow. No strings attached.,"Before I bought this, I did tons of research online. Unlike other video professor products, this one DOESNT enroll you in a subscription.The videos were very informative for my parents who are learning to use computer. I would very strongly recommend this product."
1,A MUST READ THE FINE PRINT TYPE OF COMPANY !!,Don't EVER buy anything from VIDEO PROFESSOR... I did it as a pass thru sale ($6 sale) to accomplish something else and SURPRISE SURPRISE they charged me $189 10 days later because I didn't return a 'Free' CD to them. It's all in the fine print....Refund my money in 21-30 days when I return a 'free' CD that admittedly they DO NOT re-send out to any future 'customers'. This company is working the loops on customer trust. They should be ashamed.
1,Will add to the litany - Video Professor really is a scam,"When I saw my credit card bill [...] Called to cancel as I only had the product for a couple of weeks and barely started it, but their ""customer service"" guy just argued with me insinuating I was some kind of moron who couldn't read fine print! And who does and why would you have to? He also informed me that another package was on it's way! News to me I didn't order it. But when I did order the first package, the person on the phone was speaking in such a convoluted way, it made me feel very uneasy. I don't even know if the lessons are good because I haven't had time to go through them yet. But this is no way to conduct a business. I've never written a review before but feel compelled to warn people of this guy - his ads are always screening. Watch out!!!"
1,Rip off,"I ordered it direct through video professor. They ebay and said they were sending excel as a trial and I had to return the advanced Excel. They never sent Excel, they sent internet security. When I wrote them through their website they never responded. Their website said if I returned without a code, I would not get credit so I waited. I called the next week and they told me I was past the return period. It cost me close to $200 for CD's I never ordered!"
1,Cool in the 80's but...,"Wrist-rocket, Marksman or Trumark, these are simply terrible slingshots. The wrist brace blocks all possibility of learning the lightening fast 'intuitive shooting' skills we all aspire to. Equally important, all tubes (like those used in Trumark designs) have a high drawing weight but really low power output for the effort. Fine if you want to pretend you really could hit something over 10 feet away, but... in 2012, Bands rule (and have for a long time, actually). Check out simple-shot.com. Or search 'slingshot' on YouTube... there's a big world of slingshots out there, and traditional designs really have proven better. And way nicer looking, too!"
2,Very poor,Elastic drys out and breaks in a short period of time. Needs some kind of rubber that holds up .When i was a kid we used bike tubes they worked
4,Blast from the Past,"This fires true every time. Great for scaring away seagulls. I don't hurt the birds, i just load a small green tomato in it and fire over their heads, but they get the message. Now I don't have to clean up all the seagull dung on my docks."
5,Slingshot Review,"This is a great slingshot. It shoots well, and is a ton of fun to play with.Its' a great deal for this low price...Highly Recommended!"
4,Trumark Normal Pull Slingshot,Item works pretty well. Takes a little to get used to the wrist stabilizer and the slight sideways angle that seems to be needed to aim the slingshot.
4,Hard to fire rocks but kills when connects,"Rabbits have been eating my garden and since this is a residential neighborhood, guns aren't exactly aloud for this sort of thing. So, I purchased this sling shot off Amazon.com for 15 bucks. I tried over and over again to kill these freakin rabbits but with no luck. Finally after my 5th or 6th rabbit I connected for a kill shot to the head. I went on the gut and eat it. The meat was a little tuff."
3,12345,cheap little thing alright 4 a beat around but not 2 powerful 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
5,Great product,I ordered this item not expecting much but I got much more out of it. It arrived very fast and the sling shot is just great. Right out of the box it's ready to fire. It is very accurate with even rocks. Great product and a great price.
2,Slingshot?,About the only thing this was good for was plunking cans at very short distance. Would not buy again. But the price was right.
5,bluebird house,These houses are sturdy and attractive. I especially like the easy-to-open front door to clean it out or monitor the nests.
2,Pre Drilled holes,The bird house looks nice but the top pre-drilled hole which attaches the bird house to the fence is inside the bird house and is not easily accessed with a drill motor. The drill has to be drilling at an agle and it makes it hard to install. But I kept it and worked around that. Otherwise the front of the house opens to clean out the birdhouse. Good product but they should rethink the top pre-drilled hole. When the company saw my review they offered to take it back but it is not enough of an issue to have to prep it to send back. Just know that you will need to pre-drill a hole in the top to use on a fence as the top inside hole is just not practical to use.
3,No activity yet,I bought several of these and hung on trees around the back yard. I also purchased a couple hanging types. I have yet to see one bird even land on them.
4,Oracle8i Data Warehousing,I like this book.You can learn concept of data warehousing with book.Example are very good.
4,Great Russian sampler,"When one thinks of Russian classical music; one thinks of Tchaikovsky and his ballet music. But there is a lot more to the music from this biggest of countries. Classical music flowered in Russia during the Romance period, and some of the most beautiful and evocative music to come from Eastern Europe and Central Asia appeared at this time. This CD provides a great compilation of many of these works. They include works from Borodin, Gliere, Mussorgsky, and Ippolitov - Ivanov. None of the famous pieces are included, instead we have a lot of less well-known, but still beautiful works of classical music. They include ethnic pieces such as Polovstian Dances, patriotic pieces such as the Slavic March, and ballet pieces such as the Red Poppy Ballet. The CD itself clocks in at 76+ minutes, and the sound quality is fine. Overall a great CD, especially for its price."
4,Great addition for any Queen fan.,"An interesting 1st offering from Roger Taylor's (Queen) side project band. This one came out before they became popular and is worth buying for track 4, Heaven for Everyone, which features lead vocal by Freddie Mercury (although uncredited on the sleeve). Fantastic version. A bonus for any Queen collection. If you like this album, good luck in trying to find the other two records by The Cross!"
3,Reviews by people posing as Queen fans,"I must admit to not having heard Taylor's release ""Shove It"" but felt compelled to respond as a result of the last two posts. It's quite obvious neither are very big fans of Queen.Boby claims that Taylor was the main vocals for the first nine Queen albums? HUH?Then the next guy (who accurately disputes the above) claims Taylor didn't have any lead vocals? Wow. News to me (and a whole bunch of other Queen fans)!Of course Mercury was the lead singer from first release on up to the last release of Innuendo. Also, Taylor sung MANY songs as lead vocal. Tenement Funster, Fun It, I'm In Love With My Car, Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll, The Loser in the End, Drowse, Fight From the Inside, Fun It, More of that Jazz, etc. Actually there are a lot, but this proves my point.If you aren't aware of these songs or can't tell that it's not Freddie singing then you really aren't that big a fan. I'd take comments from those two reviews with a grain of salt."
2,Pale copy,Yeah this is a pretty bad album!I liked it when it came out but unlike Queen's albums this one got old pretty fast.It sounds a lot like THE WORKS queen's period-not the greatest either but...-without the magic and the inspiration.THE CROSS is a good rock and roll band and ROGER TAYLOR a great singer and composer but this album doesn't reflect any of those qualities unlike Mad Bad and Dangerous to Know and Blue Rock (2nd and third CROSS albums)Which are real cool energetic rock and not a pale copy of Queen.
1,Handle slides off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Used this for about 15 minutes before I noticed the black rubber handle sliding off the fiberglass shaft. Had to constantly smack it back into place just to get the job done. Returning item.
3,Little Fella,My bad. I wanted a large sledge hammer and didn't really spend enough time investigating this item. If you need a single handed sledge this works well. I wanted a 2 handed model that I could bust big stuff with.
4,4 1/2 stars-- two engaging soundscapes.,"The first (and in my assessment, superior) collaboration between David Sylvian and Holger Czukay, ""Plight and Premonition"" is two extended ambient works, both around 15 minutes or so, titled ""Plight"" and ""Premonition"". The two pieces are, as the best ambient work is, gentle and yet insistent, highly engaging and intriguing. Both twist and turn in subtle ways and prove to be highly engaging.Having said that, they both are extended ambient compositions-- expecting otherwise would be a mistake. Nonetheless, the album is a highly enjoyable listen and among the better of Sylvian's forays into ambient music. Recommended."
1,Not what I thought it was.,"I ordered 3 of these DVD players (all from different sellers) thinking it was the ""perfect"" gift for my two neices and nephew for Christmas. When they showed up I realized they could only be plugged into a TV; there was no viewing screen to watch personal movies. I felt it was a little decieving how they were advertised as ""Portable DVD players"" but made no mention of the fact that they didn't come with a viewing screen. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until it was too late to send them back and find something else for my neices and nephew at Christmas. Very frustrating."
3,A Place To Start,"While it is true that the author is very 'positive' minded when dealing this subject this does not mean that all of his methods or techniques within the book are 'invalid'.I've been summoning Spirits thru methods of evocation since 1987 and I've not been 'possessed' by such a spirit. Frankly, the author's herbal potions and such in the back of the book are quite on the money. The techniques outlined for summoning spirits are not the old traditional methods but then again, these are not the traditional spirits from medieval grimoires.In the Latin-American traditions of Sorcery, such as Quimbanda, Candomble, Vodoun, Santeria, Macumba and the like, Spiritism is seen as a regular Occult practice.I'd give this book a solid try and learn from the author.Peace Power Prosperity!"
3,"Not great, but see it for St. Augustine.","This is a hokey movie, but it is a true delight for people who love St. Augustine! I watch it just for the shots of familiar St. Augustine locations and the scenery---the sights can be a real ""pick me up"" when I am feeling low.But if you don't love St. Augustine you might be better off watching something else."
5,Freaking awesome Sledge,"This is a freaking awesome sledge hammer. Look at it! It's metallic and wooden and badass. I took it with me on a camping adventure that involved a bunch of freaks hanging out in the desert, burning a ham. It helped me drive rebar in to the ground so I didn't go flying in to the air during a big, dumb dust storm. I am really glad I own this."
1,Plagiate,"This book is a plagiate of Mika Waltari's book ""The Roman"" (original titel ""Ihmiskunnan viholiset"", published 1964 in Finland and translation in English published in 1966.SHAME ON SLATER!"
4,My daughter's favorite book from 6 months to 18 months.,"Great photographs, simple joyous text, thick glossy pages and an adorable group of multicultural babies creates a book for the earliest months of a child's reading life. This was far and away my daughter's favorite book of the 20-30 we had during her baby months. It would be a great addition to any parent's wish list. I hope it goes back into print."
3,"Good, not Great","I was a little disappointed by this book. I found the subject matter really interesting, and Peril has done a good job gathering information from all kinds of sources. Peril puts very little of herself into the book, though. I would have liked to see a bit more theory or application. The early chapters indicate the blueprint that is to be followed throughout the rest of the book and there is very little development from then on."
2,"Great for reference, horrible otherwise","This book was witty and a great reference for all things mid-century and female-oriented, but beyond that wasn't much of anything. Homosexuality is never really covered in regards to women and doesn't really analyze or comment on things or even try to understand the why behind it: the book is just sarcastic in a rather juvenile sense. The best part of the whole book is when Peril indicts Betty Friedan for being a part of the pink think problem.I actually got the impression from the book that if you happen to be a contemporary female who is feminine, you're evil. And that is sad."
5,Adore this book!,"Absolutely love this book. I am constantly going back to it and taking notes from it. Combining my two loves, vintage style and culture with feminism. Most excellent. Worth The read."
4,good read,"although i've enjoyed this book, i did not find it as fascinating as some of the other reviewers. except the part about a product that was a douche/ enema/ mouthwash all-in-one: ""three orifices, one product"" and using lysol as a douche, there was nothing really new. nonetheless, a very good read."
4,very nice gift,made a nice birthday present. hubby really liked it :) it was on sale so that was nice :) :)
5,Good quality,"Good quality product. Great service, ordered from UK and arrived well within alloted time scale from USA. Very simple straightforward transaction."
4,Entertaining,My cat loves these dental chews. It's been a month and she's still happily gnawing on them and batting them around.
4,"One of my cat's favorite toys, but not a dental chew","My cat LOVES this toy. I tie it to a string and he goes crazy. I definitely bought it in hopes of helping clean his teeth but like other reviewers, this really doesn't do anything for his teeth. He occasionally chews it but I don't really see chewing a soft toy doing anything for his dental health. Still a fun toy to get your cat some exercise so can't complain about that."
5,My Kittens Love Them Too,"I bought this little set at a local pet store chain. As other reviewers have commented, my kittens love the toys but not for chewing. They love to bat or carry them around. For some strange reason, neither of my kittens would play with the toy that has cloth fringe on 3 sides. But when I snipped the fringe off two sides, my kittens immediately began playing with both toys equally. Go figure..."
3,Great toy--questionable dental health value,The Pet Stages Dental Health Chew gets a lot of licking and batting around by our two cats. They don't seem to spend any time actually chewing on it which would seem beneficial. Since cats all have different preferences I think it's worth a try. (Perhaps they do chew on it when I'm not watching!)
3,Cat loves it but...,"Have been buying these for a few years now at Petsmart ($4.99), my chewing-crazy cat loves them but they last only a week or two before he's down to the stuffing inside. Haven't found anything more durable yet, the fish last a bit longer (he doesn't chew these as much but plays ""hockey"" with them and deposits them on our slippers as a ""gift""). I just keep stocking up on these chews until something better comes along..."
2,Fine product except cats not really interested in chewing them,"I bought these for our cats as they are ~10 yrs old and I was hoping this would help them clean their teeth. I should've known though that the cats would not be interested in something bought specifically for them. One cat does like to bat them around on the floor from time to time, but no one is interested in chewing on these at all.So, at least one cat gets a bit of use out of them, although they aren't performing the task I'd hoped. Don't buy them unless you're pretty confident that your cats will actually want to chew on them."
2,Great (in theory),"My cat is barely interested in these. I love the idea behind these toys but my cat would much rather have a toy that that crunches & crinkles. If your cat isn't as picky about toys as mine is, I'd definitely recommend trying them. Their size & colors are fabulous (just wish my cat agreed)!"
3,"Good for chewing, but smaller than you would think.","It was very hard to find a good chew toy for my teething kitten, there just are not that many out there. We had the Petstages catnip chew ring and were very pleased with it, so we decided to try these too. My cat enjoys the triangle shaped one well enough, but it was smaller than I expected so it is easily lost in the house. The oval shaped one is even smaller, and with only one fringey end, my kitty didn't even give it a second look. So these do work well for a teething kitty, but are easily misplaced and would not be a good choice if you have a cat that is really into devouring a toy, they are so small I think a larger cat might eat it."
3,"Okay toy, but not amazing.","My 8 month old kitten likes these toys, but after just a few days, she stopped trying to chew them. She'll chase after the blue triangular one and bat it around a bit if I toss them, but she doesn't go crazy on them like she does for almost all other toys (and really, anything that just falls to the floor.)I found out to my regret that it's pretty easy to lose these. I think another review mentioned that, but I didn't really pay attention. Basically, I gave her the fish shaped one the first day they arrived and she carried it off - I didn't see where. Well, it's been a couple of months and I still haven't been able to find it! It's been lost since that first day. I keep thinking it'll turn up sooner or later when I'm cleaning, but it must be pretty darn well hidden.Anyway, my kitten chews on a lot of other things more than she chews on this, so if you're thinking about buying these as dental products and not just a toy, just keep in mind my experience."
2,Cat Chew Toy,"I bought these because our 2 kittens are teething and I thought they would be a great chew toy for them. Unfortunately, neither of our kittens has had any interest in them."
2,Disappointed in the size,I purchased these for my son's 5-month old puppy; but I was very disappointed when they arrived and I saw how small they were. I ended up giving them to a friend who has a cat. They are way too small unless the dog is toy-size.
1,Waste of money for me,These look like a great idea and I wanted something to help clean my cat's teeth. The only problem is that he doesn't use them. They're sitting on my floor and I don't think he's ever picked one up.
1,Torn apart in less than a month.,My seven month old kitty ripped through this chew toy in less than a month. Durability fail.
3,"Gory stories, not for the young 'uns!","Okay, why can't I find the first one? Number two is filled with three gory horror stories, one about three people trapped in a gorge and getting desperate, one about a professor whose vengeful student gets back at him posthumously, and another about the healing yet deadly effects of Martian dust.Fun times if you are into this."
5,Outcast/Downcast/Miscast,"I love this album. The arrangements are hypnotic, the lyrics poetic, the performances memorable. Marianne Faithfull has one of the most distinctive voices in popular music to begin with. Her songs ""Falling From Grace"" and ""Running For Our Lives"" are the epitome of the lonesome, angry desperation that is within all of us, if we're honest with ourselves and look deeply enough into our private selves. ""She's Got a Problem"" has two of my all-time favorite lyric lines: ""Will the world shake its sensible head/And say the words that have to be said: She's got a problem."""
3,music quality lacks,"Well of course Grease is a great movie, so no probs there... But when it gets to a song, it sounds like a bad studio recorded version-- so you're somewhat taken out of the moment/magic of the movie. Maybe it was hard to convert to a DVD??"
5,"They go together, like ramma lamma lamma ka fina da dinga dong","I was pretty dismissive about the film back when it came out in 78, but i got the DVD on an impulse and i was very pleasantly surprised. Olivia Newton John and John Travolta are simply terrific, look terrific, sing terrific and dance terrific. Not highbrow by any means, but posesses excellent production values and it actually dates quite well. My kids enjoy it, though it is marred by a few adult themes and passing vulgarity."
5,must see,Another classic that has to be seen in a lifetime. Great music. funny characters. Drag race scene. What more could you want
4,"Classic, but ...",Both classic and dated as the music trumps the plot and performances. My memory of the first time I saw it was better than the reeat veiwing several years later.
5,A great gift,You can't go wrong with classic movies for a gift. Perfect addition to her movie collection. She was very pleased.
3,"Great movie, visual quality a little lackluster.","We love the movie, but the downloadable version from Amazon isn't the hi-def remake we found at the big box store."
1,They could have done better!,"I was very disappointed in the process used to transfer to DVD. The print that was transferred to the DVD appears to be somewhat faded and dirty. However I was most disappointed with how grainy the movie is, I have seen movies that twice as old and older that had better transfers. One other note; for some reason in all of the shots that were in the soda shop they having digitally blurred out the Coca-Cola logo in signs and menu boards. This is distracting!"
3,"Good, But Very Overrated","This is a fun, energetic musical, but hardly a masterpiece of any sort. The plot is predictable, and if you think about, sends a disturbing message about how popularity is more importent then being your own person. The fabulous cast helps the movie greatly, but several of them are way too old for the characters their playing. I'd say the best parts of the movie are the songs, including ""Summer Nights,"" ""Gresed Lightning,"" and ""Your the One That I Want,"" and the cameos by stars of the 1950's like Eve Arrden and Frankie Avalon. This movie is worth seeing, but it is not one of the all time best musicals."
3,"Movie ok, Amazon download not",I downloaded it from Amazon and only got part of the movie. It missed about 12 minutes and no matter what I did I couldn't see that part of the movie. It skipped much more than that several times but I was able to reverse it back to only missing 12 minutes or so. So this definitely interfered with my enjoyment of the movie. And it was my first Amazon downloaded movie. If it happens again I probably won't use your service again.
4,High School Musical,"This movie will certainly return the viewer to not only high school years but the years of the 1950's. The malt shop, the dance, hanging-out, the drive-in movie and rumbles are set to the (then) songs of the original musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. One of the best dancers of all times, John Travolta, steps lightly across the stage with Olivia Newton-John, delivering a delightful sense of those long gone years.This creation will always stand as an epic musical."
5,No movie in the world will ever top GREASE!!!,"This is the best movie I've ever seen! It will always be a favorite. I absolutely love the songs as well as the acting. I just wish I was right there with them. As for GREASE 2, they shouldn't have even made it. It is nothing like the original movie. GREASE is the best, even over TITANIC!!!"
5,Word,"Grease is the word. This is a great flick to watch late at night with all the lights off and your chick snuggled up against you. You know you're gonna get some as soon as the credits start to roll.John Travolta was never cooler, and Olivia never looked better. You've seen this movie a million times just like I have. I ain't gonna break down the plot, or highlight the best scenes. You love it, admit it. Though I will say 'Cherry' was my favorite Pink Lady, what a pair of ta-tas.One friendly word of advice......AVOID THE SEQUEL AT ALL COSTS!!!!!"
2,Not what was promised,"Original Review:I could never get the edition with the Leather Jacket as promised. After contacting Amazon 3 times and sending back the same version 2 times without a Leather Jacket I gave up. Even their customer service department said I would never get the correct selection.I guess what you see isn't always what you get. I'm sure the actual movie is fine. I haven't opened it yet as I assume it is new and shouldn't have any scratches. Maybe I should check that, too!Follow-up Review:Judy in Customer Service called me and said she made a special effort to track down a copy of Grease in a leather jacket for me and I could send them back the old one in exchange. She was very kind and I give her Kudos for being so involved. As promised, I got my Grease in the leather jacket and my husband is impressed with his gift! I would give this 5 stars now, but it wouldn't let me change it."
1,"Dopey movie, bad message","""Grease"" is a dopey movie, with silly jokes, innuendo, and fluffy songs. But this is only part of what is wrong with the movie. Worst of all is the message it sends: girls if you want to keep your boyfriend go lose on him. Sad that a movie like this is glorified so much."
1,Wop-Bob-A-Lou-Bop-Dud,"Overblown, overlong, and over-acted film, with the original stage show considerably re-vamped and re-written to appeal to the same audience that made t.v.'s Happy Days a ratings hit. Most ridculous of all, the entire cast of ""highschool age students"" is about ten years too old to pass for teenagers.Travolta & Newton-John are generally appealing, Stockard Channing is a winner, and cameos by the likes of Eve Arden and Alice Ghostly are charming, but the over-age cast largely robs the film of anything approaching youthful engery and zest. Truly tired film lacking excitment in every possible way."
3,Grease,"The beginning of the movie all the heads were cut off, and had a little trouble getting it to start to play. Once it got going then it was ok."
4,Once loved-Twice hated,"I HATE this film, when I once loved it. Growing up has made me realize a LOT of good things about maturity, and one of them is the fact that this really is a bad movie. The acting is mediocre, if not bad, and the story is crap! I would say that is high school, there is a LOT to fret over, but not a boyfriend-girlfriend thing! Leave that to an obnoxious John Hughes film! Some of the music really is intellegently written, and the singing isn't too bad either, the I just have to say, that it does not deliver anymore. I would like to say I am a big fan, as I was ten years ago, but watching it recently, I realized that this movie was utter crap, and I cringe at it. Especially John Travolta, more like John Revolta!-or just plain revolting! My parents were right when they said the film was bad, but I wouldn't listen to them, now...I wish I had!"
3,Grease Bluray no extras,The picture quality was very good with vibrant colors but I was disappointed that the newly released Bluray version had no extras; not even the original movie trailer.
2,Scratched,"I love this movie in general, but it had a scratch in one spot which caused it to skip in one spot. I was very disappointed."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST MUSICALS,This is one of the best musicals ever made. And now blu-ray with this improved image and sound... I can't express... It's just wonderful!
2,"Great move, muddy audio","Don't need to review the movie itself: if you are a fan of ""Grease,"" you don't need to be sold on its pleasures. The Blu-ray ""Rockin' Rydell Edition,"" however, requires some comment.The overall picture is very good: colors are sharp, not overly saturated, good detail. No complaints -- the video transfer is pleasing.The AUDIO, on the other hand, is awful. The soundtrack musical numbers are clear and actually improved upon in 5.1 surround. But the dialog track is astonishingly muddy. There is a noticeable difference between the audio quality of the dialog and that of the musical numbers. I thought it was just my imagination until, after viewing, my wife made a comment about how hard it was to hear the dialog. This was a major disappointment, and for that reason, I would not recommend the Blu-ray edition.Haven't watched all of the extras yet, but they are as expected, fun but nothing you probably didn't already know if you are a fan of the film."
3,Short of wonderful,"Well.... we all know the story. There have been specials on E! and VH1 as well as the original show from 1978 ""Grease Day USA."" BUT, what happened on this much awaited DVD? The menus are silent and motionless and the only extras are an edited version of what VH1 showed as well as the original trailer, which by the way, show two scenes on the beach that were deleted from the movie itself. I was hoping for a commentary, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes.... But Paramount is not a fan based company. They just deliver products to be consumed and not enjoyed or treasured. HOWEVER, that said, the transfer is okay, falling just slightly below the laserdisc that was released earlier and with the same extras. The widescreen is great to have. And the sound is.... good, although the stereo separation is weak. I'd just wish for more. This being the first of a slew of releases from ..., I'm more likely to rent rather than buy the other releases."
1,"Like the film, hated the quality of the picture.","throughout the screening the picture would be fuzzy, felt like i was watching a bootleg film, not one i had payed for on a website. Was very disappointed because this film isn't even an action film, its a musical and it still was grainy."
5,Grease (Rockin Rydell Edition),Good movie. I have loved it since it first came out. Yhe leather jacket cover gives it even more appeal and makes it go right along with the movie itself.
3,A disappointment if you saw the broadway musical,"The producers of the film made too many changes like adding new numbers that weren't in the broadway version; this really distorted the quality of this musical. Also several of the numbers were relegated to being background jukebox music; this I felt was totally unfair to the music writers. Anyway, the film still manages to entertain even though it could have been much better."
3,Not terribly impressed,Not sure what everyone is so excited about with this blu-ray. It looked good but it wasn't great. I was not blown away like I was expecting to be. The case it comes in is about the cheapest piece of crap I have ever seen. It is not a solid case and full of holes. Don't accidentally step on it or you might break the disc. So tired of these companies cutting corners everywhere and merchandising this cheap crap but yet still charging full price. Corporate America just disgusts me. We are letting them ruin this great nation.
5,Loved it!,"This was awesome when I received it. It came with a cute little Rydell High Letterman (mini) around it, it was the cutest thing ever. Made me not want to open the Movie. I'm glad I ordered this one!"
3,Just be yourself...,"This movie is about an Italian guy that falls in love with a girl who is very reserved in her sexual prowess. Her dull style creates a lot of tension between her and her Italian lover and they have an on again off again relationship during their final year of high school. Finally, in the end, she is shattered by her lovers disinterest and desire to have intimacy in their relationship. She decides to put on airs instead of being who she feels comfortable being. I was surprised the film ended on this note as it does not sent a great message to adolescents. The music is very catchy."
2,DVD,The response was great and the shipping was great but the DVD was not in good shape. It fades in and out and is difficult to watch. But all and all it was ok.
4,They just don't age here . . .,"Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta are at some of their best here and in their prime. If you like Musicals, it's worth the time spent watching it."
5,Most fun film ever made!,"I realize that Grease is not Citizen Kane. But it shouldn't matter when it comes to entertainment, as long as the film doesn't insult your intelligence. I remember first seeing this movie when I had just turned 13 and will remember the feeling as long as I live. Grease is colorful, glossy and sincere in it's satire. And the chemistry between the very sexy John Travolta and the ultimate beauty of Olivia Newton-John only happens a handful of times every decade. Paramount truly dropped the ball in 1998 when they O.K'd the rerelease for the late winter of that year and not wait until the summer, I guarantee it would have made more money! Grease is a summer movie and will always hold a special place for people who were lucky enough to see it in the theaters."
2,Awesome Movie but...,"Grease is one of my all time classic movie, i actually bought this for a friend as a birthday gift!the way the item was displayed it came w/ a leather jacket, when i recevied it was just the movie it's self. I was a little dissapointed, i would have returned it and found another buyer but the birthday was the following day, mind you I also payed for next day delivery so it would arrive on time.. overall she loved it!"
1,There was so way to pause the movie once we started playing it.,BAD BAD BAD system that doesn't let me pause the movie once it started playing. So we had to just miss part of it. ANNOYING AS COULD BE. I hesitate to spend money on Amazon movie rentals when I can get better service from Netflix.
5,Grease is the best movie of the century!,I love Grease. olivia newton-john sings really well I think she should have her own band.
3,The movie is wonderful...the DVD stinks...,"I was really excited when I heard it was coming out since I grew up with the movie Grease. Great music, strong cast, and great story line. I got home and watched the movie and was very disappointed in the DVD production. Paramount did a terrible job on remastering to digital and I think they need to do a reissue already with better DVD engineers. There were many scenes where they were out of focus. I made sure it wasn't my DVD as I ran many others to check it. The sound for the talking scenes were fine, but the musical singing and dancing scenes had terrible audio. It was very ""echoey"" and there were some music I could not recognize instantly. All in all, movie is great, DVD stinks."
5,"All movie preservation fans, do not get this movie in FS!","I warn you, they did not highly remaster the fullscreen version. i really recommend the widescreen. i bought the fullscreen version, since i own the ws version on video, so i thought that the fs version might look nice,... But oh well, grease on dvd in both formats is good. get the ws though."
4,screen vs. stage,"I really do like this movie. I've seen it several times and the 5.1 stereo sound is more than wonderful. The acting is very very good and the talent from every actor is exceptional and i'm a big fan of everyone in this really great musical.But,,,,,the stage production is 100 times better. For some reason the movie just went ""to"" Hollywood and it didn't have to. The Broadway version captured everything that it needed and all these extras were not really needed in the movie. Just once i wish Hollywood would take course 101 in ""Theatre."" Maybe we could get better directors, better producers. Again the film is great but if you have a chance to ever see the Broadway version do yourself a favor. Then write me back and tell me what you thought. I know you'll be more than impressed. At least Michael Douglas from ""Chorus Line"" isn't in this. Never-the-less this DVD is still worth the price."
1,A Silly view of High School Life,"This movie is extremely unrealistic with its strange, fabricated view of quasi-1959, but gets away with it because it is a musical. In some songs it is hard to hear the lyrics clearly and decipher what they are singing about. Buy it and enjoy it only if you like stories with overtly foolish high school imagery. Other than that, give it a hall pass and leave it to dissappoint someone else ."
1,Wrong item,Communication error. VHS instead of DVD. They handled the problem with a full refund. Very kind.
1,I HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY ORDER YET,I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MY ORDER FOR TWO MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AND THEN YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO ASK FOR MY REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Classsics,"I have seen Grease and Grease 2 so many times, I know every last line in each movie. I have always loved those 2 movies. I have been watching them since I was in elementary school and I'm a grown woman now. Those 2 movies are classics."
5,Great movie and major improvement in quality..,Was on sale for less than $10 and it was well worth the wait and price. They improved the movie quality very well and it was nice to share this movie with the kids. They loved it too!!
3,"It's Grease alright, but does NOT include the ""leather jacket""","That's really all I wanted to say in my review of this product. Most everyone who purchases this will have seen the movie already (probably several times). I purchased it for my daughter's 11th birthday, however, and she was very disappointed that it didn't come with the silly little jacket. I'm not sure why it says that it does. . .but if you want the jacket, purchase elsewhere."
4,Great Movie - Great packaging!,"The ""Rockin Rydell"" edition comes in an adorable ""T-Birds"" leather jacket sleeve that truly makes this a collector's item.I will be buying the ""Pink Ladies"" edition just to have them both."
2,"Review for ""Rockin' Rydell"" edition","I love the movie, so my rating is not based on my opinion of the film.My biggest problem is with this edition: the ""Rockin' Rydell"" edition. They have made all the songs sound all echo-ey. It's distracting and does not fit well with the film. It really bothers me. I'm probably going to sell the DVD somewhere and stick with my VHS.If you don't want to watch this movie for the music, go ahead and buy it. But if you like the music, don't buy it."
5,My kids love Grease as much as I did.,I bought this because my girls kept watching the movie on satelite but not alwyas catching the whole thing. They love it. And I love singing along to the songs - which they don't love.
4,Great if the Sing-Along Works For You,"I returned two of these discs thinking they were defective, before I realized that the sing-along feature just doesn't work on many DVD players. I was finally able to get it to work on my Humax Tivo DVD player/recorder, but when I had tried to play it on my Phillips and Toshiba machines, the songs would be skipped over completely during movie playback, and random lines of the songs were skipped during playback of specific sing-along tracks. Also, no lyrics would show up at all. I was very bummed since this was the only reason I purchased this new edition."
4,"A classic never to be forgotin, needs more plot","Grase is a pure classic I remember going to see it the day after it opened and it was packed I waited for 3 hours for tickets but it was worth it ANYWAYSGrease is about a High School boy who meets this girl (Sandy) on the beach during the summer but when they supriseingly run into each other at school, the movie really has a little to much singing after watching it a few times you will relize that the movie is mostly just singing and the plot of the movie just kinda drifts with all of the singing."
4,Cool goodies.,"I got this for my wife and she had two of her girlfriends over and they all sang along watching it. No big surprise there. The VHS comes with a dance re-mix CD with a picture of JT and ONJ on it and the script and lyrics in a booklet. They're pretty cool for goodies in a VHS. There is also something extra as part of the program but my wife fast-forwarded past it, so I don't know what it is. Maybe interviews, maybe ""Making of"", I dunno but it should be at the end of the program -- like on my collector's ""Natural Born Killers"". I guess they wanted it to be a ""teaser"" but it's more like a ""spoiler"". This tape isn't letterboxed, but that seems to be a plus for some people. Ok, I won't say anything, I know you think you're missing part of the show on the pan and scan... I won't say anything. This is a good gift to get someone who likes 'Grease' and anyone that likes it loves it, so you can't go wrong. My wife was singing the songs when she got the thing -- a week before she watched it."
5,Nostalgia rules,"Grease is a fun-filled movie taking the viewer back to a time when America and American culture were changing from a poverty-stricken era to a time of care-free living. And yet, people are still the same struggling with love and competition and growing up. The extras for the 20th Anniversary Edition made the entertainment even more enjoyable. All ""Bomers"" should watch it."
5,Love this version,I love this movie! It also has bonus features of how they made the movie. I also loved the bonus extras featuring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.
2,One small problem...,"OK, fun songs, cute acting, generally a good time. But has anyone noticed that the moral of this story seems to say that you should change yourself into something you're not in order to please someone else? Not sure that's a message I'd want my kids to hear."
4,Grease,"John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John star in this '70s version of the '50s. Olivia came from Australia and won the hearts of music fans. ""You're The One That I Want"" is the hot number here. The pair dress in black. ""Tell me about it, stud!"" Grease appeals to successive generations. Male/female duos perform Summer Nights to karaoke tracks. The film exaggerates. There were no T-Birds or Pink Ladies where I was from. The cast of Grease was long since out of high school, ranging in age from 19 to 35."
5,One of the classics!,"I think this movie is such a fun representative of life ""back in the day"". Who would have thought that you could make a movie simply about a group of kids going through their senior year of school. It is a classic American tale."
5,there's nothing better!!!!!!!,"First off, John Travolta is soooooo sexy in this movie. But I never realized until a short while ago when I watched it again. The music rocks. If this was the only soundtrack I had, I'd die happy. Actually, I'd probably die singing ""you better shape up, cause I need a man...."". I forget what it's called. Anyways, this is an awesome movie, with a great cast of characters, lots of fun, and just plain good!!! Recommending this movie to everyone of all ages, all wakes of life. AWESOME!!!!!!!!"
5,Its HOT!,This is my favorite movie an always will be! The first time I saw it I kept watching it over and over again. I ended up knowing all the words to the songs and everything. John Travolta looks so HOT. I could never watch another movie again as long as I could watch this one! its the best ever made!
1,Already have it!!!...,I already purchased a grease movie and it has already been shipped to me. If you are over charging me and sending me something I didn't purchase please give me my money back. I have ordered alot of movies from this site and I am not satisfied with the time frame of recieving them or being told they are not available at one point and then being told I have an order confirmation for that order.
1,Paramount deserves to burn...,"Nothing about the movie, just the DVD. And not even this DVD. More the fact that I know that next year, Paramount has another DVD of Grease coming out. No word on what's on it, but undoubtedly it will be better than this DVD. That annoys me...I know you want to make money. But...any fan of this movie, I'm sure, will tell you, that no matter how much they want the movie on DVD, they would rather stick to their well-worn VHS copies for another year and get the real deal the first time around than get the movie bare-bones and cough up the dough for it only to find out later that there's a better disc, maybe even a better set of discs in store.This is only made worse by the fact that most Paramount DVDs contain a trailer and nothing else in the way of features -- their most packed DVD is the original Tomb Raider. Bleh."
4,Grease is good!,To me this is a classic feel good movie. I first saw it when I was a teen and now my kids are teens and I thought they would think it was a fun movie. I suppose they look at it like I looked at Frankie Avalon and Annette movies - but I think it's a cute and fun show.
5,Grease,Awesome!!! Movie! I would recommend this to everyone! I ordered it for my 14 year old granddaughter. She loves all the songs on it.
4,a good ole classic,"a good movie that also has a niffy added decoration - recommend for those "" cant think of anything to watch"" moments."
2,very disapointing,This has to be the worst blue ray dvd I have ever seen. The clarity and sound was bad just ruined a classic film.
5,Grease,"Grease is one of the top 5 movies that I love....everything about it..the characters, the music. It all works together so well. I have seen this movie probably 10+ times and never get tired of it."
3,Great Flick - Lousy DVD,"One of my favorites from my youth is finally out on DVD, and while it is a real pleasure to see it with the new medium's visual clarity, I have to wonder who's dumb idea it was to add so much reverb to every musical number that the characters sound like they're singing in the Holland Tunnel. There's no such reverb on the cast recording - WHY was it deemed necessary for the DVD? It was only by accident that I discovered that by switching off the VSS mode on my DVD player, the reverb would shut up and I could actually enjoy the musical numbers. If you're having the same problem, try altering your VSS setting. Other than that (and seconding everyone else's reservations regarding the DVD's near total lack of special features - for this flick, I would have liked to have seen a sing-along, bouncing-ball version... or even a karaoke track) it's still a great flick."
2,"Weak, Directionless Jazz","I hoped this would be a challenging, exciting album, especially with the line-up (Konitz, DeJohnette, Holland, etc). As it turns out, Satori is just a boring exercise in shapelessness. The standards here are supposed to be played conceptually, but the group plays like it had no idea what it was going to do prior to beginning. Any interesting musical ideas that pop up on the album are abandoned almost immediately in favor of wanking. Particularly atrocious is Marital Solal's gross overplaying and lack of ability to listen to the other musicians. Further weakening the album is the poor sound quality, typical of 70's jazz. Holland's bass and DeJohnette's drums sound thin and empty. This one belongs in the bargain bin."
2,Lot's of misunderstandings in this text,"While the topic for this book is very hot, there are several severe inaccuracies in the use and application of JDeveloper.There is also way too much theory, and while theory is fun for graduate students, the body of the text is wanting for real-world examples.Overall, I am sorry I bought this book."
5,Timely & helpful,"I've had the book since it's been out (only 3 days) but this reference has already proven to be of great value. It was extraordinarily accurate and timely in it's helpful topics.It's written with common sense and in a down to earth delivery style that is most refreshing in the technical genera. I especially appreciated the cookbook style examples with helpful screen figures, showing how the tool looks in each. I've recommended this reference to my colleages and plan on looking for further editions from these authors."
2,Not So Good,"The flow of topics is not so good. Chapter 2 was out of place. Choice of examples was also not good. It does not Cover EJB or CORBA objects only covers BC4J. Hands on trials will allow you to deploy and test specific examples, but you dont gain enough knowledge from the experiment to be comfortable with JDeveloper."
3,Kraan - 'Flyday' (Funfundvierzig) German import CD,"Originally released in 1978,it was the follow up to the band's 'Weiderhoren' lp.It's as good,if not better perhaps because drummer Udo Dahmen had joined up for the making of 'Flyday'.Unique melodic jazz rock with some oriental elements intact.Tunes that I dug the most were the seven-minute inventive ""Ausflug"",the power pop like ""Gayu Gaya"" and ""You're Right"".I can perhaps NOW understand as to why and how that Kraan turned out to be one of those top underground bands of the '70's.Check out the other Kraan reissues."
4,"Good, but not great Kraan.","If you want to try out Kraan,which you should,do not start with this one.Tracks here are weaker than normal high standard,with exeption of first track Far West,which is only 2 30 min. long.But if you are a Kraanut like myself,yes you got to have it .I have loved Kraan for 25 years,and I do slip this one on a couple a times a year for old times sake.Ok I heard this again the other day ,and it is better than 3 *s.Last time I must have done the dishes during Ausflug which is a stellar track.There is more good stuff here besides the 2 trax I mentioned.Enjoy."
1,Did not work at all for us,"Lots of trouble. Even though I used it as directed, no result. I wish I knew the answer to our problem, but this was not it."
1,Big Disappointment,"I have a shih tzu puppy who gets nothing but the best food and filtered water. I tried this product diligently as directed, both the liquid and powder - no success - a big waste of money. No way I can use a small comb around her eyes - Very disappointed!"
1,Eye Envy does not work,I purchased this product for my white boxer puppy. After two weeks of twice a day use I did not see any improvements. I would not waste money on this.
3,My opinion,Would be helpful if actual ingredients were listed vs what isn't in the ingredients since some pets may be sensitive to the ingredients even though they are generally safe for topical use.
3,nothing works on my white pekingese,"its just another product to try and see if it works and it nothing really works except due diligence when the tears, discolration begins on your puppy dog!!"
1,don't waste your money,"I tried this on my American Eskimo for 3wks, then I gave up. It did absolutely nothing to help erase the staining. Save your money!"
5,A Delight to read,"This work is authoritive, detailed and were needed succinct, and to the point, with excellent references for further investigation. The use of charts, and illustrations give the detail needed to illustrate the information being refered too. I am looking forward to Volume 2 with great anticipation"
4,Bang the Drum Slower,"Recently I bought both 'Bingo Long' and 'Soul of the Game' and compared the two not on which is best but if they still hold up. Bingo is still entertaining but Soul has more 'soul'. It's also a very dark look at a time when men were judged by how they would behave in society and the irony hits you in the face. Today we have so much outlaw actiions taking place and people look the other way on black player's behavior. One such player during those cruel times judged by his character was Josh Gibson, who in any league would have been a bonafide slugger, hitter and catcher. That they choose Jack Robinson on how he would behave doesn't set the record straight. Soul lays it down by also showing two black men and their professional respect for each other. Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson. A good movie indeed."
4,Capturing bitterness,"I have been a student of the history of baseball since my father wanted me to read books at the age of seven. I have read about one hundred books about baseball. I have written a novel which includes the early days of baseball.I have read and watched several books and movies about Jackie Robinson, Sachel Paige, and Josh Gibson.Soul of the Game does in excellent job of capturing the passion, complexity, and bitterness of these three men. Their hostility and anguish for being excluded from the ""all white"" baseball leagues is most real and vivid. For me, the movie captures the depravity of deep rooted racism and ignorance. At the same time, the movie is very dark, opening doors that most people don't want to look through."
4,Soul of the game,Great movie and performances by the cast. I felt saddened by the talented players of the negro leagues unablilty to gain national recognition especially Josh Gibson who was arguably the best ever in the game.
2,Limited,"It is too small. It will barely accommodate a Chardonnay bottle, with no room for a cooling pack. It is too short for a Riesling bottle. Otherwise looks good."
4,Respectable Debut...,"Great Beats, Great Guest Apperences, Great Flows, But still Average Lyrics...I love this album, but not for the lyrical content, they pretty much follow the standard gangsta/street formula...But, Alchenist & Havoc provide very dark, gritty, and chilling beats which blend perfectly with Twin Gambino's dark, gritty and chilling voice...Godfather remains the strongest of the three Lyrically, while Ty Nitty completes the triangle with his lisping Kool G Rap-like voice & flow...Buy this album if you like any of the following artists: Mobb Deep, Nas, Cormega, Littles, Big Noyd, Tragedy Khadafi, Nature, Screwball, Capone N Noreaga, Kool G Rap, MOP..."
4,COOL ALBUM,"IT'S A COOL ALBUM BUT IF YOU WANT REAL QUEENS FLAVA, CHECK OUT NATURAL BORN KILLA'S VOL.1. IT HAS ALL THE QB YOU NEED INCLUDING NEW FLAVA FROM NASHAWN AND HALF A MILL."
3,"Good first effort, but they are capable of better","This CD has its moments, and is definitely worth listening to. Although they are not on par with their boys, Mobb Deep, they can hold their own. I just hope they saved their best for a future release."
1,NOT A MOBB BANGER!!!!!!!!,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS WORSE THE INFAMY ALBUM OR THIS! O.K. WITH THIS ALBUM YOU DIDN'T GET ANY RB JOINTS, BUT STIL THIS ALBUM LACKED SOMETHING.IT DIDN'T HAVE THAT OLD MOBB FEEL EXCEPT:(1)THE INTRO,(2)TRACK 1-SO...SO,& TRACK (3),AND THE SWEETEST SONG ON THERE WAS ""WE DON'T GIV A ...."" I THINK THIS IS TRACK (11), ANYWAY THE SAME DAY I BOUGHT IT, IS THE SAME DAY IT WENT BACK......ON THE SHELF WHERE IT BELONGS! ONEESKAEL"
4,Classicists Beware....,"I think it interesting that reviwers who describe ""Pawn Hearts"" as challenging and ""The Least we can do...""as classic VDGG should find poor old world record ""difficult "" and ""unfocused"".Meurglys 3 they all say,is too long (Enough ,no more..Tis not so sweet now as it was before.)..well,let us leave them to their so called classic recordings of ye olde progressive rock and you and I can indulge ourselves in some fine music.World Record is a lot better than some people would have you believe."
3,Behind brilliance,3 1/2This peculiarly written prog rock never faded into the recesses of irrelevance but comes up short of excellence when pompously throaty grit commands center stage.
3,"Decent end to classic VdGG - 3,5 stars","This is the last album of the classic line-up of this wonderful band. The music of this album isn't as ""weird"" and dark as in albums like ""Pawn Hearts"" or ""Godbluff"", but there are space for two truly gems in this CD: ""Masks"" and the eerie ""Wondering"". Together with the good ""When she comes"" they make the acquisition of this album worth enough.What about the long track ""Meurglys III""? It's a decent piece of music, but Evans' drums are very plain and boring (to his high patterns) and after sixteen minutes you have a long reggae jam til the end!If you really apreciate VdGG you need to buy this album, but if you are interested only in the classics try some collection with the two tracks mentioned above."
2,Mostly awful covers of songs that deserve better,"I'll admit it: this is the only album by The Bobs I own. And given the way I feel about this one, I'll never buy another. I love acapella music in general - it's just this album that I don't like.A few of the tracks have caught me the right way, particularly Disco Inferno, which I enjoy quite a bit. On the other hand, I dislike The Wind Cries Mary, Lonely at the Top, Particle Man, and Searchin' enough that I can't even stand to finish listening to them when. Particle Man's slow tempo and the Popeye-styled brass sections make it particularly painful.I'm no purist - changing up a cover can be a great thing. I just feel that The Bobs made mostly wrong changes in this album. Steer clear."
2,a disappointment,"Sort of like a sausage with a lot of ingredients thrown together but no mixture. leftovers from various artists all put in the same album. No coherence at all. Big band, small combosYes it's Stan Getz and Miles Davis, but it's NOT Stan Getz with Miles Davis. I would love to hear both of these artists playing together, that isn't what's on this CD. Probably their egos were so big they couldn't both be in the same room with each other."
1,Creative Zen V 4GB MP3 player,"This is the second different Creative Zen MP3 player that I have purchased within this past year. The first one was for my grandson who is 20 and I paid over $200 for it. It played for about 5 months. Fortunately I had purchased an extended warrenty for it. The second was the Zen V 4 GB and that was for my 14 year old granddaughter. That one played less than 2 months and cost about $140. I would think that, since they cost quite a bit, they would be made to withstand the wear and tear that young adults give them. Manufacturers certainly must know that they will be used practically 24/7."
5,Good Things Come in Small Packages,"The Creative Zen V was recommended by a friend. When I opened the box< I was a little surprised by the size. Its very small. BUT it performs very big. I use it to listen to audiobooks in the car and it not only holds an entire unabridged book, but it holds its place when I turn it off. A big deal. The iPod I tried wouldn't hold its place in the book and one would have to fast forward to the place you left off.I'm learning new things about the Creative Zen every day and would highly recommend it to anyone."
3,Zen 4V get one for yourself,"When I order this unit I thought it came with a AM/FM tuner. It does not. Nice mp3 player, good sound, easy to use. Headphones were dead from the factory and tech support would not replace."
5,Small and beautiful,"This product from Creative met and beat my expectations. First the size, it was smaller than a credit card, then the ease of use and last but not the least the quality of the sound it produced. I tried microphone recording which, even in an external out door setting with lots of other noise, was quite good.It is worth the money I spent on it."
1,WHAT A NICE LITTLE PEACE OF FROZEN UP JUNK,"Only had this for a week and just like the other customers stated about it freezing up, that's what it did for me and it's just what it does best. It freezes. Someone said that it can always be reset. BULL! I didn't pay what i'd paid for it to reset it time and time again. Take it from me and other customers, do NOT buy this, you will end up returning it to the store."
4,battery life is ok,"This model seems to have a battery life of about 12 hrs so it's not really 15 hrs. The annoying thing is that the headphones are a bit too big and uncomfortable for my small ears. The creative media explorer software was easy to use to sync music from my pc but there were some files that couldn't transfer with the smartfit option. The smartfit option allows me to compress the file that are transferred to the zen. The error that I got was that the music files in question might not be an audio file. Those music files transferred successfully when I disabled the smartfit option and transfer them as mp3 files. overall I feel this product offers a lot for its price but I would have liked a longer battery life. The charging time was not 6 hrs, it was actually about 3 1/2 hrs for me so I think that 's acceptable compared to the ipod or sansana."
3,Good when its working...,"I bought this in Sept 06, and have had trouble from day one and since. It freezes up, then it takes me 10 to 15 minutes to reset it. Then several times I have got the message ""no license to play"". It took me awhile to figure out how to fix that. I can't get it to fast forward to the next song. And the tiny joystick fell off inside of the player. So now I have to try to navigate it with my fingernail. I have emailed the Creative company several times, they are no help. I was almost ready to throw it away today because it froze up again. But when it is working, it is great! I absolutely love having a MP3 player. Does anyone know of one that is trouble free (or almost)?"
4,Great Buy,"This Product is a steal. It has everything an Ipod does,and is really simple to use. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a mp3 player without all the ipod fluff."
3,Vista Issues,"Bought it on Saturday, returned it on Sunday at Best Buy. Could not get it to work with Vista, even after downloading new drivers. BB Hotline could not help either. I really like that size of a player and will wait until Creative can confirm it actually works with Vista before buying it."
5,creative zen V,It has been working good. Had a few problems when we first used it. It kept freezing then deleted a album and it started to work better. Now there is no problems.
1,I Wanted to Like This Player. . . .,"I wanted to like this player, but we couldn't get one that worked. After researching the features, I recommended this player to my wife who wanted a small flash memory player to use outside. I've had good luck with my Zen Sleek Photo, so the the Zen V looked like a good bet.The first Zen V we ordered had a defective navigation joystick. It wouldn't scroll up or down, even after upgrading the firmware and resetting the player. Creative tech support said we should return it, so we exchanged it for a second one. The second one had the same problem, so we gave up on the Zen V and will pick out another player as soon as we decide on one.I'm hoping we just had unusually bad luck to get two defective players in a row, but it's left me wondering about Creative's quality control. On the plus side, Amazon made the return/refund process pretty much painless."
1,Very unhappy - less than 1 star,"I received this MP3 player less than 24 hours ago, and within the first hour of operation the unit froze up while I was fast forwarding through some text. The unit remained locked up until the battery got low enough for the unit to turn off automatically. I am returning it for a refund."
2,Save your money,Save your money and buy an IPOD. This product doesn't even come close and Itunes is so much better to deal with. I sold mine on ebay.
1,okay at first...,"So I got this as a christmas gift one year and was very happy with it. It's a great mp3 player with a good navigation menu (much better than a sansa or an iPod), good features, and great sound quality. It was all I just perfect for about the first year. Thats when the problems started. One day it froze up, but I reset it, no problem. About two months later it froze again. And again. And again. And again. Lately it won't even turn on long enough to hit the play button before it freezes. As one could imagine, it's completely useless now. I'm looking into replacing it with either a Sony Walkman or a Creative Zen (the new one, not a Zen V) and I hope whatever I decide on will be more reliable. Overall, I would not suggest this to anyone, because even though it seems great, the reliability of the software leaves something to be desired."
3,Convenient but not without its problems,"Extremely easy to add files. Good sound.The amount of songs that it can hold is decieving, about 1/2 the amount quoted if you choose to store songs at 128kbps, lower quality conversion to 64kbps to fit my library at the time.Was prone to freezing, solved by the pinhole reset. The play and back buttons became somewhat unreliable towards the end of the player's life (pressing 'back' would often pause/play a track and vice versa).At the end a single pixel on the screen died, this rapidly spread and within a week the entire screen was dead - i have been in possession of what has become a clunky flash drive for a year now, wary of other creative products."
1,TOO MANY PROBLEMS!!!!,"I have owned an RCA LYRA (128mb) phillips player (256mb) and now this. I can honestly say that this on is the worst. I dont usually do reviews but i felt compelled because this player is terrible!!! It freezes up often and when it does you have to wait for the battery to completely die before you can charge it up and turn it on. all the features on it are great but if you can't turn it on what does it matter? Just check the creative web site, you'll see, i have never seen such an eloborate ""trouble shooting"" page. It seems these players in general have so many problems they have devoted pages and pages on helping you fix your mp3 player. my unit is only 6 months old and is currently out of order. I'm waiting to hear back from the email customer support (because the phone support costs $15 a call after the first 60 days, I was only able to take advantage of the phone support once :). Dont waste you time with this product."
1,Piece of junk!,I bought this product due to the good reviews on this site. What a mistake! It's the same quality as the peeler my husband bought from Family Dollar for 1 dollar... What an incredible waste of money! I still can't believe I payed almost 8 dollars for this piece of junk. I would give it zero stars if I could.
5,Excellent product!,"Excellent product! The best in its category! Pill vegetables and legumes became very easy, safe and fast. Very happy with this purchase. I highly recommend it!"
5,this peeler is over 9000,"Seriously, it's the best peeler I've ever used. Don't look at any others. The peeler part swivels easily in the grip, and it makes peeling stuff effortless. It's also cheap!"
5,Better than a Cutco peeler,I went home over thanksgiving and used my mom's Cutco vegetable peeler and found (to my great astonishment and pleasure) that my Oxo peeler did a better job and was probably a third the price. I've had this for 3 years now and it looks and feels like it's new. The tip is hollowed out so you can scoop out bad spots on potatoes etc. I love it.
5,THE BEST!,"I love this peeler! I had one just like it for many years (until I somehow lost it!) and it worked perfectly EVERY time. I couldn't remember where I bought it and couldn't find another one in any stores - until I finally looked on Amazon. Thank you, Amazon! Not only is the gripper handle perfect, the blade works as it should. I purchased a couple other peelers during my quest and I was very disappointed. Their blades kept slipping over the vegetables without cutting. Very frustrating. I even tried a kitchen Aid brand and hated it. So save yourself the frustration and the tired hands and just buy this one!"
4,Great peeler,Great peeler and easy to use. Sharp too. I did have another one it is did fall apart so hopefully this one will last longer which is why it didn't get five stars.
5,Frustrations begone!,Frustrated by the standard peeler of my chef of a roommate I went on a mission to a my local supermarket and found this delectable piece! I've had no issues using it in my cooking and baking venture's and it has become a much loved item in my kitchen. Works good on both fruits and vegetables.
2,Caution! Not safe to use!,"First of all, let me say that this peeler is comfortable to grip, and is very sharp! It has no trouble peeling potatoes. However, due to the wide gap between the blade and the handle, combined with the extreme sharpness of the blade, it's very easy to slip and injure oneself. Every other potato peeler I have ever owned was only capable of peeling fruit or vegetables. You would not be able to damage human skin even with effort. However, there is no safety built into this peeler. Today I slipped and took off part of a fingernail, including some skin! I was not using much pressure, as it doesn't take much pressure to remove the potato peel using this peeler! With a sharp knife, using less pressure generally means that there is *less* danger of cutting oneself, but I have to be very, very careful with this peeler. Will be looking for another one that is designed with safety in mind."
2,Frustrating & overdesigned,"I've read some of the other reviews, but I'm not impressed with this product. While I like the Oxo line in general, this peeler is maddening. The grip is fine, but the blade is just a little too short for peeling large potatoes or other vegetables. To make things worse, the plastic piece at the end (designed to better stabilize the peeler, I suppose) gets caught up on the vegetable you're trying to peel. So, you can either peel really slow, or gouge your veggies to death.In short, I can peel faster with a paring knife than I can with this tool. Keep looking, this one's not worth the hassle."
2,"Frustrating, dulls quickly","I have used this peeler only a few times and it is already quite dull. It is now practically impossible to peel an apple with it, although on straight peels, like carrots, it still works like any other mediocre peeler. Also, the ""swivel"" never really worked well. It was always difficult to peel a curved surface like an apple with this thing."
2,suited to carrots but worthless for potatoes,"As with all OXO Good Grips products, the handle on this peeler is great. The blade, however, is less than 2 inches long, making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes, though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers. Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating, rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers. In short, this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."
5,Best ever peeler,"What more can I say? It works perfectly in both directions. Like all OXO Good Grips stuff, the non slip handle is nice to use. You don't have to be a senior citizen to appreciate it!"
4,Excellent for left-handers,"Finally a kitchen tool that suits all of the chefs in the family. The swivel blade and great design make this THE peeler for left- and right-handed people. I finally don't have to use a special left-handed peeler and actually get a sharp edge that peels smoothly. The large, squishy handle balances well in your hand and lets you peel as long as you have to without getting hand cramps. Bravo!"
2,"Terrible blade, Nice handle","I am so disappointed in these. The handle is awesome, and I was excited to have a comfy grip when I peel carrots, potatoes, squash, etc.Total failure. Just plain doesn't work. I first tried a butternut squash and thought maybe it was just a super tough skin. Nope, my 99 cent peeler worked great. The blade extension for gauging potato blemishes gets in the way on large flat sections of the squash as well.So I tried fresh carrots with the OXO. Nada, the blade dug in at an awkward angle.I've talked to a couple chefs and a culinary school teacher, and they all agreed - ""Stay away."" They just don't use them.I recently talked to my bartender too, and he said in 15 years he has never seen one in a professional kitchen.Now the OXO sits, rusting, in my junk draw with spare potato masher and bad chopstick collection.""Form follows function"". OXO designed a great handle, but forgot the the function of the tool."
2,bulky,The blade is good but the huge handle makes it hard to use. Someone with small hands would find this very unweildy. I bought this to replace an old peeler of similar design but with just a simple metal handle. I shall be going back to using that.
2,0X0 good grips swivel peeler,I was very disappointed because it takes off too much peel and it is clumbersome to use. I will continue to use my 20 year old peeler until I find a good replaacement.
5,It's all true,"I really didn't believe it until I used one of these while helping my sister in her kitchen...amazing. Of course I got one at the first opportunity. I didn't think I'd like the OXO products because I don't tend to care for the larger-sized handles, but it really is comfortable to work with and makes me look for an excuse to peel carrots. (BTWm their garlic press is great, too) What a sadly rare experience to buy something that's so inexpensive but works so well."
5,Excellent Peeler,My other peeler fell apart and I've been using this one for about 6 months. It's Excellent. Easy to use. Cleans up well. Does everything a flexible swivel peeler should do. It's been perfect!
4,EASY TO USE,This product has a great handle and peels well.Has a natural swing. You can definitely avoid getting cut if you're not lucky with knives like I am.
4,I love this and use it regularly,Its great blade and handle makes for fast peeling jobs. Only thing would be: I wish the peels didn't hang on to the end once peeled off.
5,Great first veggie peeler,i've never owned a peeler before this. only used my parents' growing up. This must be a sign that you're interested in cooking and eating better when you need a vegetable peeler!!i would recommend to everyone looking for a peeler. the grip is soft where you hold it between thumb and index finger. The hole on the grip is just big enough to hang this if you want.
5,Just what I was looking for,"This is just what I wanted out of a potato peeler. It cuts just fine, and you'd really have to try and cut yourself in order to do so. It's a good product."
5,Comfortable Handle and durable,"This peeler is very well made. Comfortable handle makes peeling much faster and easier.I've had mine for years, peeling it way from potatoes and apples to oranges and carrots.It's lasted me a long time with frequent, consistent use and it still looks a brand new.It hasn't gone dull on me either,so I consider it one of the most efficient and practical purchases in my kitchen.I recommend it highly,no doubt anyone will love it."
1,sadly disappointed,"I recently bought my second Oxo Good Grips-I bought the first one in 1990 or so...I lost the first peeler (still working perfectly) just recently so I bought a new one to replace it and now I'm sorry to report that this new one is certainly inferior to my first Oxo Good Grips swivel peeler. Maybe the company was sold-something has caused the quality to drop so I have my mind set on a different brand that I'll be getting soon. I wish I were giving Oxo GG a splendid review! I have other Oxo products and though most I got awhile ago, they work well."
3,serious defect,"It works well and the handle is comfortable. Unfortunately the handle fills with dirty dishwater in sink or machine. The water is hard to get out and when I take the handle apart to drain it, it is difficult to clean inside. Since I use a peeler often for raw foods (apples, carrots) I worry about infectious contamination of food from this non-hygienic tool."
2,Good grip but will rust,"I've had my Peeler for over a year. Almost as if a switch had been thrown, it has become almost completely rust-covered over the past few weeks, after no rust whatsoever since its purchase. Even the handle, which is difficult to clean, is now embedded with rust. I'd would follow the Amazon buying guide and just get a cheap peeler that you'd can 'refresh' from time to time."
4,I like this book but it DOES NOT have a recipe for----,"CARCAMUSAS!!!!!On my recent trip to Spain I took a day trip to Toledo andhad this hearty, yummy dish called Carcamusas. From what I have readabout it, Carcamusas is sort of a signature dish of Toledo. How could this book not have a recipe for (or even mention) Carcamusas?!?!"
4,Editing left much to be desired,"My 7 year old really enjoyed the book; much of it was a bit over the head of my five year old. It reminded us of ""Five Children and It,"" by the same author (which we liked much better, by the way, definitely a worthwhile read). This seemed to drag in places. The 4 stars are for the book content itself. We read this on the Kindle edition, and I'd give about 2 and a half stars for the poor editing. In some places sentences were improperly punctuated, and words were misspelled or omitted entirely. This poor proofing detracted from an out-loud reading and took much away from the story. I expect an occasionally misused or misspelled word, but in this text there were more than 10 in the book."
3,"Probably great for 9-12 yr olds, but not me","I read this as a homeschooled 13 yr old. For me, the reading level was extremely easy--but the story was neat. Nesbit has some cool ideas, but . . . I guess her style just isn't what I like. I think I'd recommend this for a read-aloud to younger children. Nesbit *does* has a wonderfully developed imagination!"
2,Hard to get into,"This read by my 12 year old daughter. She is an avid reader, but couldn't ""get into"" this. She says it was a bit dull. Only read one chapter."
1,Don't purchase this reprint from Wilder Publications.,"Don't purchase this reprint from Wilder Publications. The punctuation and type-setting is a complete mess. Many punctuation marks are missing, while others are in the wrong place. Some paragraphs don't start where they should, others start where they shouldn't. It would be very frustrating for a child to try to read this reprint, so even at this price, it's not worth it. I'm going to purchase another edition for my girls and recycle this one."
4,Great Read for Kids AND Adults!,"I picked this up because another favorite author, Edward Eager, says it was E. Nesbit who inspired all of his incredible works. What a wonderful decision I made! Nesbit does not condescend to her reader, whatever their age, and has written an enchanting tale of the magic that can happen withn you believe. Enjoy!"
3,Worse than the first book,"Not that great, but still a decent continuation that will not make you give up the entire series. Give it a try."
4,No closure to this book.,"The book is wonderful most of the way through (for those who enjoy books like the other novels in the series); however, there was very little closure. The main plot of the book details the post-formic wars, Bean's continuing relationship with Achilles, and Peter Wiggin's path to Hegemony."
5,What is there not to understand?,"First of all, the entire series is based on the fact that humanity would trust a brilliant child to lead them in warfare. The reviewer above who thought that these children coming back to lead nations was a ridiculous concept obviously does not understand the first book which he/she claims to have liked. Secondly, the issue of religious beliefs being entered in to this book which were never there before is also ridiculous. Read Ender's Game over again and you'll find very clearly there are references to religion in there...... Card's craftsmenship is flawless in this series, and his skill at dealing with human beings placed in moral situations--no matter how young or old is unrivaled. The best sci-fi author alive today period! Shadow of the Hegemon is a fine novel and continues in the excellent tradition of this series."
2,Card trying to write like Card,"This book is a sad example of Card trying to write like Card. It doesn't even seem like the normal author in this tale. The characters are shallow, the plot is thin (and borring), and when the last page ends you are left wondering at the title...why was this book called ""shadow of the hegemon"" WHEN the hegemon (peter) is almost completly ignored. Yes he pops in once in a while and writes a few essays but there was never one momement when you even glimps what will make this man great. This book is nothing more then a poor chance at making money off of ""Ender's Game."" It falls flat"
4,pretty good book!,"I have read almost all of five of the books in the Ender series and by far this is the best of them all. Ender's Game was a very good book and when I partly read the next two books I was seriously disappointed. They just had no imagination! Orson Scott Card makes up for this in a big way in the story line of Ender's Shadow and especially Shadow of the Hegemon. They bring back the true spirit of the series. This most recent one has to be one of the best science-fiction books as well as an overall war story that is futuristic but very believeable. Its only low point is the fact that as I have found with the entire series, it is really slow going, but once it starts it doesn't stop till the last page. This book is great! The letter near the end written by a nun to Bean is one of the most personally realistic few pages ever written in a book. Read Ender's Game, skip the next three and read the Shadow books. The next two books should make it a complete series."
4,Orson is on a ROLL.,"What an amazing book! Much alike Ender's Shadow, I didn't expect to be stunned and amazed! The book is centered around Bean, Peter, and Petra, through a series of politcal ploys. Also much alike Ender's Shadow we are given a deeper look at Bean. I must say this book is perfect for Ender fans, though as everyone has said before, don't begin the whole series with this book."
3,When will Ender end?,"Although I love the way Orson Scott Card writes, I feel that the subject matter in the latter Ender books appeals to a different audience than the original Ender book."
5,Card gets better with time.,"I found the book riveting and had trouble putting it down. This book rivals Enders Game, and is the best in the series since the original work was published. Card is at his best when writing about children. Excellent effort and a rewarding read."
2,"Weak Story, Characters, Politics","Ender's Game and The Speaker for the Dead are worth the time. This book is not.Card thinks too much about his insight on political science. In the afterword, he brags that he's been interested in international relations since he was a kid. Unfortunately, he hasn't grown up. His plot is two dimentional and he has no understading of the history or politics regarding Russia, America, Thailand, or any other country.His characters are also thin and two dimentional. The story: Bean and all the other ""child warriors"" return to earth, where an evil kid somehow awaits them. The evil kid leads entire nations to kidnap on all the other smart kids in order to rule the world. Huh?Read Ender's Game and forget about this one, unless you're stuck on a 13-hour plane ride with nothing else to read."
3,Generous three stars because of the previous books,"The only reason I gave this book three stars was because of the previous books. I know all of the characters and I wanted to find out what happens to them so the book kept me interested. If it was a stand alone book, I would have not finished the book and would have given it only 1 star. Achilles 'the psychopath' is given absolute power in India and no one even suspects that he is driving the country into the ground until it's too late. Yeah, that would happen. Anyway... enough bitching. The only people who should read this book are the ones who want to read the 'complete' series."
3,"Not just a shadow, but a new object completely","Card returns to the world he created in a very new style. The characters we fell in love with in Ender's Game, and those we commiserated with in Ender's Shadow, are in a new environment. And on the world scene,those characters seem to lose much of their charm. Whereas before they were geniuses among geniuses, outwitting each other through intellectual battles, here many ""stupid"" characters come into play. Personally, I was hoping for a biography of Peter Wiggin, playing cruelty and generosity off each other as situations provided to gain power. However, this is more a story of Bean and Petra, much like the old novels yet very different and somewhat ""uncomforatable"" in their new surroundings."
4,An Amazing story with a horrible ending,"Obviously i capitalize Amazing because the story truely is Amazing, yet to make sure that there is a sequel, Bean has to make some retarded moves. Basically, some of the events are impossible, but you have to read the story anyway."
5,Shadow Of the Hemogen-Kates Review,"Shadow of the Hemogen was very good. Some might feel it is not up to Card's regular standards but don't forget everyone who reads this book is expecting another Ender's Game, but this is Beans story. Card did an excellent job in this installment of the Bean Saga, you get the picture of Bean and how he really works. This is a great read and for those of you who are a fan of the other Enders books then you will enjoy this one. Except for on scene of the book that was a mistake it was very well written..though the ending does keep you hanging a bit.."
2,"Okay, it's getting old already.","I'm a fan of this series, but enough is enough. Authors throw originality out the window every year to write sequels to neverending series that drag on and on. I have a pet peeve with authors that continue to churn out books with the same subject. Stop already and write something new for us. Please!!"
5,Shadow of the Hegemon,I have become addicted to the Enders Shadow series after reading the Enders game series some 20 years ago. The draw for me is the political intrigue as the formics have by this book bitten the dust. Nobody reveals the mind of the Napoleons of our day better than Card. Luckily for me I am reading this series as Shadows in Flight has come out so i am enjoying all the Shadow books at a single read. With Peter as the Hegemon struggling to make the office relevant to the rest of the world we see the members of Ender Jeesh impacting the world in a number of countries and often at odds with each other. Card has had a remarkable run with Bean and this is some of his best work.
4,A worthy addition to the Ender/Bean series,"This novel follows Bean, Peter Wiggin, and Petra (characters introduced in Ender's Game) as they exert their influence and take on Achilles, Bean's long-term nemesis. The plotting is excellent, and the character development is good. Card's knowledge of geopolitics and both the strategy and tactics of warfare is evident. My only quibble is that Card sometimes explains too much."
3,Great until you recognize the Wisdom level doesn't match the age,"I don't care how genius a kid is the dialog and maturity of this story speaks more wisdom out of these childrens mouths than any life experience could possibly have endowed them with. The story though often boring was still enjoyable, however I am pulled out of the story every time their age is brought up. I loved Enders Game and even it at times bordered on overly wise words from children that couldnt possibly understand these things. Had their ages been bumped up even 5 years in these stories it might have made it more believable for me."
4,the young genius,"This book by Orson Scott Card, is a very good sequel to Enders shadow. It gives more depth about the character known as bean. They tell about his personal life and how he struggled to stay alive. Bean is my favorite character in the Enders game series. He shows the most wits and learns the fastest. He develops emotion, which he has never felt before. Bean, ends up saving the world along with a team of super intelligent kids that think they are playing a game but in reality they are actually commanding star ships in a galaxy where the buggers reside.Not only is Bean a survivor of 25 which 23 were burnt down, he ends up finding his parents and eventually meets his long lost bother. His savior, who is also like his mother, finds Enders brother Peter. Bean helps peter become Hegemon.To me this is the best book of the series, because to me Bean was my favorite Character, because of his intelligence and his past experiances."
2,My Least Favorite Orson Scott Card Book,"This was my least favorite Orson Scott Card book to date, by far. I've read all the Ender's Series, the Shadow series up to the end of Shadow Puppets, and the Empire series.I could barely finish this book; it grated me. If it were a movie, only 40 minutes of 4 hours was any good. The only reason I finished it was b/c it's essential to understand the next book in the series.-Finished on 2012-08-27 (116,804 words in 7 days; 16,686 wpd)."
1,Great Book but Amazon issues,"This was a great book to read, the story I enjoyed very much. My experience with the actual e-book was ruined however by the fact that every page or so the last sentence would not flow into the next page from the previous one. I had to keep removing the eBook from my device and re-downloading it in order to no skip the last few sentences at the end of a page and the beginning of a new page. This is why i switched to Google books. The kindle App is just plain horrible."
1,"Appaling, boring and rapidly becomes intelligence insulting","With great hope I opened this new book in the Ender series, hope that it improves on the previous one in the series, Children of the Mind. Which was just plain boring. Had to skip to the end as could not bear the appallingly plodding script and magical approach to plot devices. Bad luck for me, this is worse. Within a few pages the stupidity of the plot, shallowness of the characters and non-exploration of SF causes headaches. Perhaps one of the worst books I've bought. Do not buy! Orson has lost it."
1,didn't care about plot premise,"I simply did not care what happened on earth in terms of political power. I care about Bean and his Jeesh. (For the record, where did this bizarre terminology come from--it wasn't in the Ender books, was it?) I want to understand how Bean is going to deal with the real world, as well as his classmates. I don't care who is in power on earth. And I thought the handling of Peter's parents was absurd! Plus, the killing of Sister Carlotta was a waste. How did Achilles become so powerful? There is no clear explanation for this. It was a bad book. I hope the final 2 are better. Perhaps Card is out of ideas..."
2,Fails to measure up,"The Ender Quartet was great stuff. Ender's Shadow was awesome. But something happened between the last Shadow and this one... whatever it was, Card failed to come through with his normal grandeur.The story itself is somewhat hard to buy, granted we suspend disbelief for fantastical works, but it was still a little much. Kidnapping the kids to force them to command your armies? Even a mediocre commander is going to give you better results than an enemy held at gunpoint. I simply couldn't buy it.The endless amount of Bean being compared to a Christian ideal is exceptionally irritating. Card can only bring it up so many times until you want to scream ""Ok, I get the point, not get on with the story!""The whole thing left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. My advice to you is just to quit with Ender's Shadow and guess as to what else happens... certainly much more fun than wading through this."
2,Card is desperate,"What was Card's intention in writting this book? To make money, I suppose. But while this is most writers intentions, you can tell Card's desperation in this book. He should have stoped writting about the Achiles character in Ender's Shadow, but he does so again in this book, with guarentee that he'll be in the sequal to this. The Bean character was strong enough to hold ""Enders shadow"" together, but he came across as an unhuman like character. In some respects the book is satisfying, but not enough for me to recommend it to anyone."
2,Boring,"Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, ""Enderverse"". I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics. Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years. I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics."
3,Sci-Fi Political Intrigue,This novel continues the story of Petra and Bean as they attempt to make sense of and influence the direction that the world would be taking in the aftermath of the formic wars. This novel is more a story of political intrigue and struggle than the adventure story of either ender's game or ender's shadow.An entertaining read.
4,"Amazing story, incredible author","I love the Ender series and have been sharing them with my 12-yr-old son via audiobooks. This format makes the stories readily accessible to weak readers. However, the mispronunciation of a major character's name when the text explicitly and repeatedly clarifies how the name SHOULD be pronounced is frustrating and distracting. I would still recommend any of the Ender/Shadow series to anyone. OSC is one of my top 5 favorite authors!"
2,Way To Political,"I was a huge fan of Enders Game and Enders Shadow, however, Shadow Of The Hegemon disappointed me. There was almost no action in it. The whole book was just political conversations, so political, that they were hard to follow. What little bit that I was able to follow, was uninteresting. If you were a fan of the rest of the Ender series, I recomend that you at least try this book. That is why I gave it two stars instead of one. You may get something out of this book that I did not. But before you dive into this tale be warned. It is extremely political and almost entirely comprised of long conversation. But at least attempt to read it like I did."
4,Enjoyable Page-Turner,"This book is the second installment of the second Ender's Game series (the ""Shadow"" series). It covers what happens on earth after the events of Ender's Game/Ender's Shadow. While not as good as Ender's Game or Ender's Shadow, it's definitely better than the last few books in the first Ender's Game series. Not the most developed book in terms of character development and so on, but fun and hard to put down."
2,Lifeless,"OSC is capable of much more depth than Shadow of the Hegemon has. It is a watery story with little character development and the pace of a poorly played chess game. Granted, it is difficult to write characters who are supposed to be smarter than the author, but OSC did it with Ender's Game.....OSC admittedly wrote Shadow while concurrently writing a different story. It shows."
3,Casting A Pale Shadow,"Shadow Of The Hegemon pales in the brilliance of Ender's Shadow. But then again, sequels to works such as Ender's Game (Speaker For The Dead, Xenocide, etc.) and Ender's Shadow are exceptionally difficult undertakings - how does one compete with a world-class big brother who can do no wrong?The principal element of greatness in Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow is character development. Because the sequels employ the same characters, for the most part, Card has to depend on the story line to carry the book. It becomes clear fairly quickly that Card's greatest strength as an author lies in creating unforgettable super-hero-type personalities, rather than in yarn-spinning.Nevertheless, Shadow Of The Hegemon is entertaining and a good read (unlike the off-world sequels), as long as one does not expect to be taken in the same way that Ender and Bean inevitably capture the reader: innocence triumphs over evil through character, brilliance and sheer willpower."
4,The ties that bind,"I think Orson covers the development of the charectors very well. The reader learns more about the charectors as the charectors learn more about themselves. He also keeps you guessing on the gray area of light and dark. In the writing he also proves the point that no matter how smart you think you are there are people out there that are most likely as smart as you. Most important of all it pushes forward the idea that hearts are what binds people together not countries, not birth right, not family, not even religion. The greatest bind is the bind of the heart."
4,Good Budget Sander,"I knew the base was made from plastic before I bought the unit so that wasn't really a big deal to me. Even though it has a lot of plastic, it seems to be well made, runs smoothly and has enough power for a typical home shop. There are definitely better options out there, but not in this price range. This is a budget spindle sander that does it's job."
1,And this is from a die-hard RW fan.,"Ok. I love the Real World. Love it. Watched it from season one on . . . religiously until season nine or so. I bought this DVD the day it was released.I could not have been more disappointed.The original soundtrack is gone, replaced by a horrible, grating score (no ""Finally"" at Roxy?!). The crawl is gone (and some of the best moments--like Eric's scar story--took place during the closing credit sequence). The features (asinine episode intros and a schlocky ""pilot"") just suck.My advice to fans: Get a DVD recorder and wait for a marathon on MTV."
2,Missing something,"Never realized how much the The Real Wolrd benefits from having the hit songs of that time showcased in it. All those cheesy songs from the early 90's have been taken out of this edition, and replaced with really [bad] public serive announcement sounding music. This cast by far was the best, but even that doesn't carry the show with no real music behind them. Catch it in in reruns!!!!!!!"
1,Pretty much unbearable,"Let me start this off by sharing that I am a huge, huge fan of The Real World. That being said, I have learned my lesson, and that is this: in order for The Real World to be enjoyable, it must be current. A season or two ago is one thing, but this was just unbearable. I (barely) made it through an episode and a half before I caved and turned it off. Everything was just too dated for me to relatte to it at all, and the drama felt cheesey and forced. I'd save your money, personally."
3,"I have yet to view this DVD, but..","I'm glad that Mary-ELlis and Jon have decided to place seasons 1 and 12 of the Real World on DVD, but what about some of my favorites, like Boston, Miami, Seattle, and Chicago? I would love to relieve Genesis's self-discovery and just plain old b**chy Flora.... I hope that they do release all the seasons."
1,NO MUSIC???,"I was about to purchase this DVD until I was informed that the original background music was taken out and replaced with something entirely different. Why?!? The first season DVD should have the original early 90's music, in which I love. So because it doesn't, I'm not buying the DVD. I'll consider buying this DVD set when the aforementioned mistake is corrected."
4,Good,"Its great watching where Real World started, its fun watching the styles of the early 90s, the bigs hair etc. but the songs are missing, like where is ""Opposites Attract"" and all those other early 90s classics? Recommended but with no music it loses its appeal."
3,Not the Raymond book you're waiting for,"This book has a lot of little known, eccentric material about Raymond-- his Christmas card drawings and his design for his country club menu that you would never see any other way, but it does not begin to cover his major achievements such as Flash Gordon adequately (very little reproduced from original art). The author clearly adores Raymond, which is to his credit, but he sometimes loses perspective. For example, I could do without the author's two page discussion of the unresolved authenticity of a drawing done for a movie ad by either Raymond or Austin Briggs, recounting the details of the author's phone calls with an auction house . I wish he had replaced it with more of what makes Raymond great. This, combined with the thin, inferior quality paper and cheap binding, and the odd design (what's with the unnecessary blue stripes on each page?) suggests that the definitive Raymond book is still to be written."
5,WORTH THE WAIT!!!!,"At last it is here, I just got this book today and the illustrations alone are worth buying this book. Raymond in my mind is up there with illustrators like Rockwell, Wyeth, La Gatta and the rest. Raymond's work goes beyond comics, and like the reviewers quoted on the back cover his work remains an inspiration to me."
5,"Educated, Open-minded, thought-provoking book","My friend's old pastor wrote this book and so I was a bit skeptical upon reading it, but after a few pages I was completely hooked. With an open-minded non-demanding style, Howell tackles the issues most often asked about Christianity in a way that revives both believers and non-believers and does what most Christians somehow fail to do.. pull others closer.I recommend this book for every single person who's ever had a question about Christianity."
3,Neural Network Introduction,"A pretty good book if you want to learn about Neural Nets. The theory, the basic algoritms and a bit about what kind of net to use for what type of problem. All math and other things you need to know is also explained in the appendix. I recomend it for any one that want's to learn about neural nets."
1,Not By Choice,"Was forced to read this book as it was a selection of a book group I am part of. Slow, awkward, and sigh-inducing. Gives book clubs a bad name."
3,Tired and Lame,"Rohinton Mistry's ""A Fine Balance"" was a majesterial novel, sublime in epic and subtle in emotion. His follow-up ""Family Matters"" by comparison is an exhausted novel, never really starting, and moving by the sheer force of its own inertia. The writing is hackneyed, the plot simple, the conflict nonexistent, and the resolution contrived. Unfortunately, it seems that the fame and success of ""A Fine Balance"" has simply exhausted a once thrilling young writer."
4,Touching Story,"I enjoyed ""Family Matters"", and found it superior to ""A Fine Balance"" as a story. It was not overburdened with history and politics as was ""A Fine Balance"", therefore this book was a more natural, and less engineered read. The only problem I encountered with it was that I found the general turn toward the end a bit difficult to believe. It just seemed to come out of nowhere. I think that a little bit more character development might have remedied this apparent fault."
4,Worth the read,"This was a really great book with lots of insight into families and the complicated feelings that we have for our relatives. Mistry is a great writer because his characters are so well developed, you can feel them; and there is always something redeeming in each character and some empathy to be found for even the most vile characters in his stories.The only reason I gave this only 4 stars is because I have read Mistry's other books and this one is not quite as good. For one of the greatest books I have ever read, check out A Fine Balance."
4,Good but no Fine Balance,"interesting issues are dealt with in this book. The process of aging, the hints of Alzheimers, the relationship between all family members when an elder becomes ill. The family dynamics on both sides of the grandfather's family are full of emotion, anger, even betrayal i would say. I was expecting it to be on the same level as A Fine Balance but it is slightly less. However, i would still recommend it as Mistry is one of my top 10 authors."
3,"Well written, if you like tragedies!","I was very disappointed in this book. One the one hand, it did give me a peek behind the curtain into Zoroastrian society in Mumbai, which was interesting. On the other hand, all of the characters had a fatalistic attitude about everything and be determined to find a way to make a complete mess of their lives no matter what.It reminded me of an Indian version of Coronation Street."
5,In my humble opinion....,"Rohinton Mistry is quite simply the best writer out there right now. I have read this book and ""A Fine Balance"" and have derived more pleasure, sorrow, and enjoyment from his writing than from any other author. His books show humanity at its finest and at its worst. Do yourself a favor and read his books, because there is a reason he is always nominated for awards.... HE IS THE BEST!!! Can't wait for the next one... will it take another 7 years? I hope not!"
5,Award Winner,"This book won the Quill and Trowel Award of Excellence for Photography given by the Garden Writers Association of America for the Year 2000, tantamount to the Academy Awards for Garden Writers! The photography is truly exceptional."
2,Not Quite Right,The calming waves in the beginning of the CD are perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. I was feeling relaxed and comfortable and was really enjoying it. Then the birds started. And then there were more birds. And more birds. And they drove me nuts! Not sure how the rest of the CD is but I had to turn it off after what seemed like an eternity of annoying and sometimes harsh bird calls.
2,Coastline and Inland...,"I bought this CD hoping for peaceful shoreline sounds my infant could sleep to but was disappointed because after 20 minutes you don't hear the ocean at all; instead, it sounds like you're in the amazon listening to the local bird population. To be honest after hitting the ""bird"" section I always started the CD over and never found out if we return to the coast. If you are looking for authentic nature sound effects this is nice, but if you want a white noise wave CD you should find something else."
4,Good white noise,"I live in the city - lots of background noise all the time. This on an old Ipod with a JBL speakers is great in my bedroom - small and like being in the carribean with the window open. Also, a great value when one compares the cost of other sleep systems."
2,Charming but ultimately thin,"In the interests of full disclosure, I should start out by saying that I don't know a thing about the culture or about literary standards of excellence in this author's society. However, ""Midaq Alley"", while a pleasant read, wasn't anything to write home about. The characters are lively and the setting fascinating but the author never delves deeply enough into the life of any individual to make you feel as though you fully understand them. The style may have lost something in translation, but it lacked the richness of language and description that I expected to find from an internationally-recognized author.Not bad, but altogether a little disappointing."
3,See the movie,"This weekend I saw an adaptation of this book in a movie starring Salma Hayek. From the reviews I have read here, it is very similar, but takes place in Mexico. I was spellbound by the movie, and will therefore try to get the book."
2,This book is kinda....,"If I were to choose a book that I could not live without, it would certianly not be this one. I think out of all the books that I read, this must be the most boring one. The main character in this book is Hamida, but this book is composed of many characters who have their own little stories within this book. And she represents Egypt in World War 1. She was tricked into becoming a prostitute for money, makeup, and fancy clothes. If you think about it, Egypt was given the illusion of becoming world power if it were to join the war. When really, all Egypt learned were ... policies. Personally, I did not enjoy this book at all."
4,A darn good story,"Midaq Allay is a slice-of-life picture of several months in a small alley in Cairo during World War II. The residents of the alley all have their small dramas, and Mahfouz manages to weave all their stories together to tell an interesting tale of love, lust, greed, selfishness, religious devotion, depravity, and drug addiction. It's an Egyptian soap opera!Mahfouz is an excellent story-teller, and the various characters and their actions come alive and make continued reading a compulsion. Of course, I have no idea if this is a true picture of life in that place and time, or if everything is slightly exaggerated (which seems likely to me).Mahfouz has received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and this is not one of his most acclaimed novels. It is always interesting to perceive how those of another culture think, believe, behave. Plus, Mahfouz tells a darn-good story."
1,not in English,"Not really a review, I'm sure it's a fine book. The Item is listed on Amazon as being in the English language, but it is in Arabic. Please be aware."
3,Interesting Look Into Egyptian Society,"I have to say that Midaq Alley is an interesting, albeit not fabulous read. The characters could use a bit more substance, but overall their motives were described clearly (somewhat). Hamida is really the main character of this novel and almost everyone else in Midaq Alley is connected to her future in one way or another. I consider Midaq Alley to be an interesting book for anyone interested in Middle Eastern womens' rights and struggles."
3,2 LPs on 1 CD,Tracks 9-16 with Griffin and Jenkins were originaly issued on CD on OJC under bassist Wilbur Ware's name. I was disappointed by it as Jenkins tone did not cut through the Riverside sound quality well enough. Tracks 1-8 are a Griffin quartet short track Argo/Cadet session from mid 1950's Chicago.
2,dissapointed listener,"This CD was very dissappointing. I expected to hear gently crashing waves with a sea gull backround. I didn't hear any sea gulls and the waves sounded like they were crashing in a hurricane,very loud...I had to turn it off after 15 minutes because it gave me a headache"
5,The Surf of the Pacific Shores,"So relaxing to sit and listen to - or to have playing in the background while working, cleaning, reading - doing just about anything. It sounds as though you are really at the beach, listening to the crashing waves. I love this CD!"
1,Not working.,I received a replacement part since the first one wasn't working. This one doesn't work either. I'm 100% sure the Treo is working fine. I sent several emails but got no response.
3,"Good buy, but was wrong adapter for my Samsung Juke","The product arrived on time and as described. It seems to be in proper working order BUT DOES NOT WORK WITH THE SAMSUNG JUKE cellphone/mp3 player, so if you've got one, don't even try it."
3,Shipping rip-off,"It's a great price until you realize they charge shipping for each one you order. I wanted to buy 5 of these. They should be shipped together for one charge. Price was over $20 with shipping. Shame on them. This looks like a sucker trap.To be fair, Radio Shack offers an adapter for just under $10 so this is still a better deal than the Shack."
1,PLease note -- this adaptter converts a regular land line phone head piece to a cell phone head piece,This adapter did not work on my Samsung phone. It is not designed for music but rather to convert a regular land line phone head piece to a cell phone head piece.
1,does not work!!!,"I read reviews here where people complained of crackles during their workouts. But I figured I'd just be walking to work, not jogging, so i'd have no problems...WRONG!Any movement at all will cause this cheap technological nightmare to make crackling, popping, snapping sounds. Even just walking at a normal pace, with your iPod in you interior jacket pocket. Or in you shirt pocket. Or in your coat pocket. Or in your hand.Very UNportable. Boo."
2,It works but......,"It came incredibly fast, and the condition was great but, it was really loose inside my phone input. and the main reason i bought it was to talk with my beats by dre. headphones on xbox live, they didnt work. All i could hear is my buddy speaking but he couldnt hear me. ONLY buy this if you plan on listening with a mp3 (no voice control)."
1,Really bad,"I had high hopes for this product, I got it for my girl friend for xmas. Story is, I love the beats by dre head phones and she doesn't understand why so I decided to get her a pair, problem was her phone only had a 2.5 adapter, so I get her this and believe xmas is going to be great and all work out. This adapter ruined my present, it cut out, u stick it all the way in and it wouldn't work, it would work half assed if u pushed it in the device half way but seriously it still sounded vey bad, I would highly recommend spending a few more dollars and get a reputable brand so u won't have the same problems I encountered."
5,has not let me down yet,lasted over half a year and still going. It is a great product to plug any headphones into. Definitely the best alternative for the lg chocolate phone.
5,a bargin,"I use this for my motorola cell phone to listen to the music. Someone said the sound only come out from one side, you only need to pull the plug out a little bit. That is because for a headphone designed for cell phones there is an additional ring for mic, so when you plug this one in, that may or may not line up exactly, so you need to pull it out a little bit."
1,Not worth it!,Does not work. Sits in a drawer and is not useable. Only sends sound to one earpiece. Don't waste your money or time.
3,Beware of shipping cost,This product is exactly what I needed and the price was right (40 cents) but I was shocked when I was emailed the order confirmation when I saw that the shipping and handling cost was $16.95
5,A classic that influences the music of today...,"I grew up listening to this soundtrack as my parents played it quite a bit. It's amazing how music you just ""heard"" as a child can touch you in a completely differnt way 20 years later when you actually LISTEN to it. It's easy to see how the work of Giorgio Moroder was a heavy influence on Madonna's 2006 ""COnfessions on a Dance Floor"" album. Listening to the two albums back to back, you can distincly hear Moroder's influences in Madonna's work.Confessions on a Dance Floor"
5,Great information that's fun to read and easy to put to work,"""The Road to CEO"" shows how you can beat headhunters at their own game. I really liked the short quiz for calculating your leadership presence and tactics for looking like a leader. This book is fun, practical and easy to read--light years away from the run-of-the-mill business how-to."
1,Don't bother,Horrible film Just plain bad. I don/t know what else to say about this film. Ols 60's or 70's film.
1,this book is socialist,"I purchased this book on the understanding that it was anti-socialist. That is, I thought the author from Eastern Europe had discovered that socialism was a big lie and was going to explain why so many people continue to support socialism even though socialism does not make any sense.The book is not like that. Instead, the author complains about make-believe problems like ""exploitation"" and seems to think that the only problem with Eastern Europe was that there were not enough labor unions. People who truly are anti-socialist will get annoyed if they read this.John Christmas, author of ""Democracy Society"""
3,OKAY all around review,"FYI: I passed the 4/09 exam on the first try. My other materials were the 6 Minute Solutions, the NCEES Practice Test, and the Lindberg Reference Manual.I bought this book because it was a reasonably-sized (thickness-wise) overall review of a ChE undergrad education... and b/c almost 5 years out of school, I hadn't used one iota of my education, and needed such a book.The Review was often presented in a way I didn't learn -- so while I was frustrated, I was forced to learn and understand more. The book is bad about errors and not defining variables, the practice problems are even worse than 6 Minute Solutions (see my review for that book), and ultimately the book might drive you to insanity, violence, or both.But, I needed an entire undergrad review in one book, one that I could forge through on nights and weekends in 3 months, and this fit the bill. It's designed for the previous generation of PE exam, but still worked for my needs."
1,The paperback stinks too!,Don't be fooled by the updated cover. The paperback version does not fix any of the serious flaws contained in the hardcover version. Don't waste your money.
3,Not a bad review book,"There is no book yet published that is particularly good for the ChE PE, but this one doesn't deserve such poor reviews. It is far more coherent than the most popular review book (by Professional Publications), although it doesn't have reference tables or graphs that might be commonly needed. It is more like a distillation of ChE textbooks."
5,Jewel of Oxford Scholarship,"To quote Nicholson Baker in The History of Punctuation essay from The Size of Thoughts:John Lennard's extraordinary recent monograph on the history of the parenthesis [is] gracefully written and full of intelligence, decked out with a complete scholarly apparatus of multiple indicies, bibliographies, and notes, whose author, to judge by the startling jacket photo (shaved head with up-sticking central proto-Mohawk tuft, erring on left ear, wilted corduroy jacket, and over-laundered T-shirt bearing some enigmatic insignia underneath), put himself through graduate school by working as a ticket scalper at Elvis Costello concerts. (A Discussion of Elvis Costello's use of the parenthesis in ""Let Him Dangle"" figures in a late chapter.)"
2,Welcome to the desert of the boring...,First let me say that I'm a big MATRIX fan. I also have a passion for philosophy. I had high hopes for this book but was soon dissapointed. With each new essay I felt I was starting over. The cave analogy became tiresome and I often found the different essayist going over the same topics. The other writters seem to use the movie to go off on ideas that have little to do with the movie. If you're just starting out in philosophy this might make an o.k. introduction otherwise I would keep looking.
2,Are you illiterate?...,...If not pick up a real philosophy book. This is fluff my roommate picked up because he thought the Matrix was 'deep'. I love the movies but this is pathetic. These concepts are too important to be treated so shallowly. This is a primer for one who has no genuine interest in philosophy.
2,On Second Thought.....,"Heidegger and an entire tradition in Western Thought that began with Thales back in the day are likely wondering by now if an unexamined life might be best left alone. This is MTV philosophy: an entertaining read for 3 or 4 minutes at a time, then go get a pepsi. Like the film, it is a bit of harmless fun.If however, the suggestion is put forth taht there is something besides pop culture going on here, better we should all head back to the Cave and stay put staring at the shadows."
3,disagree with above somewhat,"The above author, in talking about the film's religious themes, states that ""faith in oneself is a non-theist position"" in order to show that the film doesn't advocate any particular stance on religion. First, faith in oneself is not necessarily a non-theist position, i.e., you may think you are God. Secondly, being non-theist does not equate to being religion- neutral. Buddhism in many forms is non-theist.On a different note, the ""philosophy"" expressed by the film more closely resembled Advaita Vedanta (a monistic school of Hinduism) than any of the other views mentioned in the book."
1,delivery horror,"I ordered the book for a friend, another professor, but Amazon shipped it UPS with signature required. UPS left two stickers on my door while I was at work and I never got the book.Why not USP--the US Post? A paperback book with value of $17 does not need to be shipped and handled like opium or gold. If UPS, why signature?Bottom line, it was returned to Amazon, I ate the shipping charges, and bought the book at my local Barnes & Noble. End of review.Great book, BTW. I'm teaching it next term. But the university will do a brokered order through Bowker and students will pay a 40% mark-up, I suppose. Who's getting rich on this racket?--Dan Bentley-Baker"
2,very dissopointing. this book just plain sucked!,"i couldn't wait to get this. but then when I started reading it, i just got so fustrated with it. i mean, it was such crap...what they were saying. they got everything completely wrong. at the end of the book, i was so pissed off, that i started to just write down why hate their stupid little debates they propose. this book is a disgrace to the wachowski brothers and just the matrix phenomenon in general."
3,A few essays worth reading,"A few of the essays deal with whether we could be living in the matrix (or some other alternative to the real world). The others use the movie as a springboard to discuss other areas of philosophy, but the connection to the movie is very thin.A few authors tried to argue that we cannot possibly be in the matrix, but I thought their reasons for thinking this were inadequate. I meditated about what I myself believe and came to the following conclusion. A matrix is a logical possibility, but there are plenty of logical possibilities that are not realized in the real world. And how does one choose among numerous logical possibilites? Here's where Occam's Razor applies. The simplest answer is that the world is for the most part what it seems to be. As long as this explanation works and makes sense of things, we might as well prefer it. We gain little by seriously entertaining more complicated possibilities."
5,Are You a Matrix Guru?,"Here it is - a book that NO true Matrix fan should be without. If you ever contemplate the many philosophical ""splinter[s] of the mind,"" this book will shed new light on your analysis. Was Cypher's decision morally wrong? What subtleties did you miss? This collection of essays provides insights into one of the great science fiction movies of our time."
3,Great philosophical read; Some inherent contradictions,"This is an excellent book where some great minded philosophers tackle the issues presented in the Matrix. Solipsism, Buddhism, and Christian themes are explored, placing the beloved movie into schemes that all can enjoy.Primarily asking ""If the matrix could be real?"" was the main reason why I was interested in this book. Solipsism has always been fascinating to me, and even in my deepest philosophical moments I do consider myself a solipsist. However, I was disappointed with the articles on this subject. Rotten with axiomatic contradictions, I felt that some of the authors were too shallow in their approach to ascertain if our observable world is true.However, I still greatly recommend this book to philosophically minded people."
2,may be good intro book for some,"i think this book would be alright for a matrix fan taking their first step into philosophy. but if that is not you, and you expect some kind of growth from a book, i would not suggest reading this."
2,A view from the shadow world,"The book was strangely pervasive. Chapter by chapter the authors cite the same sources and say the same thing in slightly different ways.About midway through the book, it becomes clear that the chapters have been written by shadow dwellers describing the same shadows that they see from their shackled platonic position in some common academic cave. Perhaps colleagues, wired through some philosopher's conference, brains in brain vats, enjoying the view from a Matrix of their own making...That in itself makes it an interesting read."
3,Guitar Book 1,The book provides some basic first steps for someone beginning on the guitar. The biggest problem I had was with the enclosed CD which has been glued into the seam of the book and when I removed it the CD broke. I manged to retrieve some but not all of the files. I tried to get a new CD through Amazon and directly from David but received no reply to my e-mails. The book gives some basic strumming techniques and some introductory music. The pace of learning is quite slow.
4,The airsoft gun,I bought the gun about a year ago and it still works. its a good gun and shoots fast id say buy it
3,"meh, it's okay","It looks just like a real AK-47 but made of cheap plastic- doesn't fire very far. The scope is just for show.THE SHIPPING IS HORRIBLE! EXPENSIVE AND WAY PAST THE EXPECTEDAlso the company that makes this has poorly translated instructions like ""When magazine is fully, remove this loading."" Or my personal favorite, ""Collect all these exciting new set. It will give you infinite pleasure."""
1,THIS IS THE WORST GUN EVER TO HIT PLANET EARTH!,this gun...is the worst gun ever...i got 2 of these because the 1st one i got was used...the barrel was cracked and it didn't come with the extension barrel! this gun goes about 50ft...if that and about 10ft. before it curves...SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!
1,cheap,This gun was very cheaply made and not very durable. This gun in my opinion is not even worth $5.00
1,"Great for throwing, crappy for shooting.","THe gun is crap. I got it for a heckuva cheap price, so I went out back, I loaded the bbs in which was a pain in the a$$, pull the trigger. Nothing. again, again. Nothing. So I give the magazine a gentle push into the feeder. CRACK. The barrel snaps off. I threw it at the wall. I was pretty pissed for rest of the day."
1,DONT WASTE MONEY & TIME,This (spring warrior) is junk if you want to waste your money buying garbage this is for you the bipod broke the first time I used it the scope is not a telescopic no wonder the only desist thing in this is the laser.
1,this gun is horible!!!!,"i bought this gun directly form hoobytron for 17.99 i had to pay 15 bucks shipping!i got it two and a half weeks later then the two week shipping period! when i got it the bipod stunk it fell apart and they laser site fell apart the barrel broke also.When i took the gun i cocked it and shot it agisnt my skin and i barley felt it this gun is at the most 150fps.also i shot it a someone about then feet away from me in perfect weather and i missed(and im not a bad shot)also the scope has no lenses for magnafication. if you are buying it for a friend or son or anyone you like DO NOT BUY THIS GUN,YOU WILL BE DIAPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!"
2,For Kids Only,"Simple. If your child is under the age of 10 and you want him to have a start in Airsoft, This piece of .... is good for nothing other than to make him/her cry in 5 minutes when it is busted."
3,this is not a sniper,"honestly I have nver bought this gun but I alrdy kno this is not a sniper, it is 200 fps first of all. im sure its ok for ist price but if ur looking for a sniper do no buy"
1,The smelly gun,The gun looked cool but dont let that decieve you its smelt grotesk (smelt like donkey bum) its wasnt good smellin buy it cuz its kool like marshmellos.Theeeeee End?
3,"Decent approach, but with a signifact number of errors","I am practicing to take the SAT in a few weeks. This book is helpful in teaching how to approach certain topics, but there are some real issues with example problems provided. I have found multiple annoying errors, especially in problem wording. Its difficult to learn when ""the correct answer"" is in fact incorrect. I have confirmed with several other people that what I encountered are most definitely problems with the book. Also important to mention is that certain solutions provided for examples are brief and incomplete or encourage you to guess and check while promising doing the actual math is not possible. Although this book can still teach you some valuable lessons, I would not fully recommend it."
4,very good,"I don't drool over the Velvet Underground and their important influences in rock like many people do, but not giving their few album releases a chance would be missing something big. Well, somewhat big.This album is a giant change compared to White Light/White Heat. THAT was one insane listening experience. This album however, is MUCH more laid back and easier for casual music fans to accept. While I have to be in a certain mood to appreciate the quiet tone throughout the album, I can't ignore the fact that, when I AM in that mood, this is really good stuff.Not the best album they ever did, but probably worth owning."
5,a lifelong fan,"the reason i dabbled in music myself. this is my all time favorite CD ever, solid air comes in second"
5,Sunday long ago,"If White Light/White Heat is the late night downtown scene, not so much on a Friday or Saturday, but on a Wednesday, when only the locals and the hardcore seed the bars and clubs, then this one is the lower East Side on a very hot and bright Sunday afternoon, long ago, long before our modern era of boutiques and designer pastries, but rather when the lower East Side on a Sunday afternoon was mainly deserted among the tenements, the record stores and book stores shuttered up, the drunk sprawled out across the asphalt, and the romancer heading out of his shared studio walk-up in search, flies buzzing and all the parking spaces taken."
4,A Great Album,"This is an excellent effort by the Velvet Underground. It is definitely my favorite album of theirs. with such classics as Beginning to see the light, and Pale Blue eyes, it is really a good listen. The poetry on Murder Mystery is powerful and thoughtful. i would recomend this CD to anyone that likes the velvet underground."
5,Any Album By VU is Five Stars!,"The Velvet Underground's third album is their softest album to be released. It is also one of their best. Although John Cale is a musical genius, Reed is also. This album shows that they could be incredible and influential without Cale. This album doesn't have quite the mainstream sound as Loaded, but it is close. Besides The Murder Mystery, all the songs are commercially accesible. I'm not saying that is good or bad. It is just a fact. The Murder Mystery is still a great song. Pale Blue Eyes is one of their best ballads. Songs like What Goes On and Beginning to See The Light show that they can really rock. And Some Kinda Love has those kinky lyrics that are like Sister Ray and Femme Fatale. Every Song Is Incredible. VU didn't release a bad song. Buy This album."
5,"""A little wine in the morning/","A little breakfast at night/ Well, I'm beginning to see the light.""If you are already a fan, you own all of their albums. If you want to know what the fuss is all about, this is the place to start. Fresh and exciting thirty (!)years later."
4,not nearly as cool as their other albums,"With the exception of a few brilliant songs (Candy Says, After Hours, Murder Mystery), I can pretty much live without this one, as opposed to the other 4 studio albums of theirs"
2,"Oh look, Lou Reed on heroin...","Oh, their finest hour, eh? This album is so full of soulless and bland material, its sickening. I hate Pale Blue Eyes with a passion. Sheryl Crowe covered it, and really, I can't make out the difference; both versions blow.Basically, the band was trying to make up for releasing an album as coked out as White Light/White Heat. If you like your Velvet Underground spineless, this album's for you!"
2,Puzzling to see how this is praised so much,"It seems to me that a large part of Velvet Underground's cult fame and mystique comes from the fact that these guys can't play well.Lou Reed can't sing worth a nickel. Period. He talk-sings his way through most songs, and when he does try to actually sing, it's a pathetic attempt. Mo Tucker's voice is also a joke on the song that she sings. The songs are all 2 or 3-chord repetition, the guitars are frequently out of tune, and Tucker can't keep a steady beat to save her life.So somehow, bands that (1) can't play, (2) sing about the sleazier side of life, and (3) get ignored -- sometimes rightly -- by the public, somehow these bands rise to legendary status. Makes you wonder where people's values are."
1,If this was their most accessible work................,"I was intrigued by many of the reviews of this album and bought it without being familiar with any of the cuts. Well, if this is their most accessible album, it's hard to imagine what their others were like. Musically, this is absolute drivel. Perhaps if one was looking for poetry and can ignore the rudimentary vocals and the dearth of melody, it's of some value. The musicianship isn't special, either. While listening to this, thoughts of slashing my wrists began to seem favorable in comparison. I ended up giving the CD to someone as a white elephant. The single star rating is only due to the lack of a ""zero"" option."
4,After the storm.......The sunshine. But the scars remains...,"Well.....let's put things this way....Velvet underground first two records are considered rosetas stones of the modern pop and rock music. The banana album and White light/White heat were chaotic in their essence...sometimes brutal....innovative.....the fact is that Velvet Underground is the first absolut modern rock band...... They crossed the red line in the first 2 albuns.....something dangerous, painfull,revoltutionary to do......They could never get out of it without scars..stigmas.......After going to hell...they found out that maybe there's a light somewhere. THAT'S WHAT THE 3RD ALBUM IS ALL ABOUT! Faith....on something better.When something like this happens....someone ( a person, a band, whatever..) finding a reason to smile right after the darkness..it's beautiful...like a child under the sun.Thank you."
4,A Restrained Classic,"The Velvet Underground's self-titled third album is a dramtic departure from its two predecessors. Restrained, spare and haunting, it contains a bevy of classics from a band that continues to have a huge influence more than three decades after calling it quits. Artsist as diverse as R.E.M., The Feelies and Sparklehorse have either covered songs from this album or taken musical and lyrical samples from it. It also contains some of band leader Lou Reed's best-ever songwriting. The two quiet masterpieces are ""Pale Blue Eyes"" and ""Jesus,"" the latter of the two even managing to be surprisingly spiritual. Other highlights include the rocking ""What Goes On,"" ""Candy Says,"" and the (somewhat) hopeful ""Beginning to See the Light."" The only songs that don't work a the two overly arty experiments that conclude the album.Overall, an understated classic that will stick in your memory long after it has finished playing."
5,Another gem by this band.,"This album shows a mellower side of this band. ""Candy Says"" and ""Pale Blue Eyes"" are two of the best songs that Lou Reed ever wrote. This album, had it been released after the first album, would have probably opened them up to major popularity. Instead, it came after ""White Light, White Heat,"" one of the noisest albums ever released. This album deserves to be heard. It is the one album that is overlooked."
4,A MELLOW ONE BY THE VELVET'S,"This album is a mellower version of the Velvets, probally trying to clean up old habits, I don't know, it's a pretty good set though. Candy Says is a nice little slow understand every word song, along with the organ in control What Goes On. Beginning To See The Light, good little sample here of rebirth or something. And if you want to save yourself well then Lou will sing you a little bit of Jesus here in this set. This album didn't get good reviews back in the day, but I thought this was a pretty good album, not as good as Velvet's with Nico, but I still like it better than White Light White Heat, that album just kind of aggravated me. Anyways for you AVANT GARDE lovers only, heres your 1969 Velvet Underground"
3,Pleasant,"Nice little cd, 30 plus minutes.My big question, is, why has his Soul Surfing album never come to cd. His ""More"" was a massive hit in the early 60's."
5,The sweet smell of success.,I ordered this for my wife for Cristmas and she absolutely loves it. She owns 30-40 diferent bottles of perfum and has been using the Michael Kors exclusively ever sence.
5,My Favorite Perfume,This is my favorite perfume that I wear daily. Such a great scent that you can wear all year round. This is my second time ordering from this seller. I order on Wednesday and received my box on Thursday afternoon. Fantastic.
5,An All Time Favorite,"Men & Women compliment me on this smell all the time & it works with me all day long. I love this fragrance...time for me to re-order, my bottle is getting low. I'm not giving it a chance to run out. Highly recommended if it works with your body chemistry."
5,Michael Kors parfum,"I got the best price in the market, and the product arrived on time. When I wear this parfum people ask about it because they like the scent."
3,leaky bottle,"This is my most favorite perfume. I always get this same kind, but for some reason- this bottle leaks. It has ruined the cabinet that I keep it in and seems to leave a film on everything that it sits on. Love the smell, awesome. However, the bottle ain't right."
5,Excellent!!,"This is my favorite perfume in the whole world! It is not cheap, and I was so happy to find it on amazon a little cheaper then at Sephora. I am so happy!"
4,Elizabeth Browning poems,"This book was one of the earlier American editions printed. It is a complete collection as the authoress intended them to be. I am enjoying reading them and feel like I'm there, as the one I got is 150 years old. There is something about a book that was printed when the author was still alive. It not only includes her famous ""How do I love thee..."" poem, but many other wonderful love poems that I was able to discover."
4,Are you ready for an amazing surprise?,"If you only know Tiny Tim from ""Tip-Toe Thru the Tulips With Me"", you will be surprised by this album. Most of the songs here aren't sung in his high pitched falsetto voice, but rather his natural baritone voice. Admittedly, there are some people who can't stand him in any voice, due to his extreme tremolo when he holds a note. Personally, I dig him. On this album, Tiny Tim and Brave Combo work very well together. It's a natural combination, since both acts are lighthearted and perform in a somewhat retro style. Simply put, this is just a fun listen. Recommended for fans of cool and strange music."
5,Marvelous,"Tiny Tim and Brave Combo -- a match made in Pop heaven! Tiny could still use his falsetto when he wanted to, but much of this recording features his rich baritone. As was his forte, this collection features great historical songs like ""That Old Feeling,"" ""Sly Cigarette,"" ""New York, New York,"" ""All That I Want Is You"" and ""Stardust"" -- plus renditions of Pop Hits like ""Girl"" and ""Hey Jude"" (Lennon-McCartney) and ""Stairway to Heaven"" (Page-Plant). The classic ""Over the Rainbow"" is a high point. God Bless Tiny Tim!"
5,Tiny Tim & Brave Combo Delivers On Girl,"Its strange that it took 8 years to get this album made and the sad part is its tiny tim's last album.Girl has alot to offer. if you like cover songs from the 60's , 70's and way before that example sly cigarette from 1898! you'll enjoy this album. Tiny Tim & Brave Combo delivers."
3,Crossing the line.,"Carried Away is ultimately a cinematic treatise on the dangers of crossing that line no man should ever cross, but a line that so many tiptoe upon either in reality or imagination. Dennis Hopper's character is an aging, bored teacher in a rural farm community. His life is predictable and the only question that still stirs within it is when he exactly intends on marrying his long-time girlfriend (Amy Irving). Things take a sudden change when a new student arrives in town, brining with her a willingness to seduce her teacher, if only to keep herself entertained while living in the new but overwhelmingly drab town. He, although sheepishly at first, falls prey to her advances and within a short period of time, finds his life is complete and total disarray. A solid film, but the gratuitous nudity was a bit forced."
3,Utimately disappointing but the acting was superb.,"I expected a poignent character study of the way these people's lives were impacted by the affair between a 47 year old teacher and his 17 year old student. Amy Irving is magnificent as she battles between her pride and her genuine affection for Hopper's character. Hopper is astonishing in his dignified, quiet desperation and sudden hopeful passions. Gary Busey is also remarkable in a role which calls for more restraint and subtlety than he's been allowed before. But, while the acting was superb, there was something wrong with both the pacing and the plot. Too much time was spent on the affair and too little on the ramifications. I wonder if men would find this movie more to their taste than women: Siskel and Ebert gave it 2 thumbs up..."
5,Recommended viewing,I expected this movie to be something I have already seen before. But what I got was something more and better than I had expected. Good performances by all involved.
4,"Amy, Amy","Honestly I didn't realize Amy Locane was such a bombshell until I watched this movie. And she also gave a very strong performance. Amy Irving did a really great job too. ""Carried Away"" came out in 1996, and I haven't seen in the last 5 years any other movie scene as explicit (and thought provoking at the same time) as the one with Irving and Hopper in the buff - yes, both of them. In the wrong hands, that kind of shots could have turned this terrific film into a Lolita-style soft porn."
5,Well worth it!,"When I first considered this product, I thought that having a corer was unnecessary. I don't like having gadgets that only do one task, but this product has made any apple preparation an absolute breeze. It makes it easier to eat healthy and avoid the seeds. OXO makes quality goods, and this is no exception. I am happy with this product and would recommend it to fellow apple lovers."
5,Works perfectly,Does just what it's supposed to - cores apples perfectly every time. The size of the corer takes away only the core and the serated edges make it really easy to shove through the apple. The grip makes it very easy to hold and maneuver. Dishwasher safe and a great product - would definitely recommend.
5,It does the task of coring fruit very well.,"When I purchase a tool for a job in the preparation of food, I really want it to be a time saver and to perform the job easily and well. This corer works for me and I have used it every day since it arrived. Thanks for another excellent product OXO!"
5,Good indeed,"I like eating apples with peanut or almond butter, but I used to hate trying to cut the center out of each apple slice. This device has fixed that problem. I put the apple on top of a cutting board and then push the Corer straight through the center of the apple. It is large enough to get the entire core out of small to medium sized apples."
4,does the job,"works well, pricey but what isnt these days. it is what is is. If you dehydrate apples, it is perfect for decreasing your workload."
4,Sturdier than you think,"This is the only corer that I was worried about (I bought three different styles because of the differences in my family), but this little guy is great. It doesn't feel bulky and it does look kind of lightweight but it isn't. This little guy goes right through the skin and does a good fast job of going through the apple. On large, irregular apples it may need a second pass but it is not a problem for this corer. This could only be better if it made a larger hole but I wouldn't want to give up its narrow tip to make a larger core.The narrow tip is what makes this corer nice, because you can go back in the core to get those stray seeds that get missed and not make a bigger hole."
2,Missing teeth (see picture),Disappointing for an Oxo product. Seriously defective with teeth missing as illustrated above. My wife who has a wrist problem really struggled to use this. Just bought a Henckel corer and expect much better results.
2,"The ""Browninator""","My nickname for this is the ""browninator"", it works great for what it is suppose to do, but it causes apples to turn brown almost instantly. They should have made the device out of hard plastic like the lettuce knives. It's too bad, it is very effective and apparently will hold up for a long time."
5,works great,"This is the first corer I've ever owned so I have nothing else to compare it to, but I like it. If your apple core is slanted when the apple is sitting on the counter, you should tilt the apple while pushing down on the corer so that it can go straight through and get the whole core. That's not the corer's fault though. It is also easy to clean."
5,"Easy to use, easy to clean","This corer makes the job of coring apples and pears an easy job. It's easy to use and to clean. It is simple and well made. The size of the hole is fine for medium sized fruits. For a bigger fruit, after I core and slice it, I place the slices flat on the cutting board and use the corer to remove remaining core. Most important of all, my kids love eating more fruits when they are sliced into rings."
4,Works well!,"This corer is far superior to the older, wooden one that I had. It cores a wider hole in the apple, which helps to get the whole core almost every time. That it is dishwasher safe is another bonus!"
4,More of John's adventures,"Archie and John go fishing. That sums up the book about as well as ""a couple of teenagers fall in love"" sums up Romeo & Juliet. This collection of short stories is a delightful read and is a worthy addition to any collection."
5,Entertaining,"Very pleased with the transaction, prompt receipt of the book and the content. Gierach has a way of entertaining the reader and at the time making him think just a bit."
3,This is the true story of an average DVD,"This DVD was ok because unlike ""Decade of Bloopers"" there was alot of new footage shown. It shows vacation clips from the Miami, Boston, Seattle, Hawaii, New Orleans, Back To New York seasons as well as the Chicago season's unseen vactaion to Boston (they were supposed to go to Europe but didn't due to 9/11). The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because unlike the ""You Never Saw"" series this video only offers a few hillarious moments and isn't something I'd watch more than once. I would say it is better than ""Greatest Fights"" or ""Decade of Bloopers"". I say just rent it or get a friend to buy it and borrow theirs."
2,Dissapointing,"This DVD has nothing to do with the dialogs and events happened in the vacations in THE Real World seasons.I am angry to myself not caring about the other customer reviews.It show the videos of where did they go,what did they eat,did they get sick etc.. which are very very boring stuff preventing you to see the dramas and partying happened in these vacations.If i want to know what can be eaten in the exotic places of the world i can find it on the google.i want to see how the real world house spent their time when they are on the vacation.very dissapointing for me to what i expect and what i get."
1,Terrible,If I could give this dvd a negative star I would. This is the worst You never saw. I'm mad I bought it.
5,Traditional sounds from a timeless voice,"I remember hearing Martina for the first time and being totally blow away by her incredible voice. I din't buy the CD then (and don't usually buy an artists first one) because so many have just fillers. I have since purchased 7 of her CD's (my all-time favorite being WILD ANGELS). I bought this CD a few months ago and now it is my new 2nd favorite Martina CD. I can't belive it took me so long to buy it. It's filled with incredible songs, each with a great hook, done by one of the best voices in country music in the last 30 years. If you want something with a classic, traditional, pure conutry sound (as opposed to most of the pop/rap/modern/new-age stuff on the radio), this is the CD for you."
4,effective,I have always done cardio but with very little results. Being better able to target heart rates using this watch has been very effective in helping reduce weight and increase my general health. Buttons on the side have a tendency to come off.
4,Improved my workout,"When I use the heart rate monitor, I get much better weight loss and more calories burnt. I still can't get the software to work with the computer as it uses audio signal to connect to the computer. A bit of a pain really. Nonetheless, the summary on the watch itself is informative enough. I use it to keep track of my heart rate so don't really need to connect to the computer. It would be good though if I had that option."
1,Many problems,"I've owned this watch (the black one) for about a year now. I did not purchase the foot pod accessory.The watch has on 4 occaisions gone 'all black' lighting up every pixel on the face. When this happens you have to do a 'reboot' holding all 4 buttons down simultaneously until the watch resets. Of course all your data needs to be reentered.THe watch has also mysteriously reset to March 24, 2005 on 4 or 5 occaisions (10am I think). The time and date are all messed up but it keeps your personal info.The problem appears to be on the RS200 only. Check out the posts on runnersworld for many, many more disatisfied customers before making a decision on this watch."
1,**Avoid RS 2000- Worst Runners Nightmare**,"Have always been a fan of Polar products untill I bought the RS.I have used for more than a year now the RS 200 and it has been a ""nightmare"" so far, with 3 times to warranty repair centers with out any solution and a lot of patience and time.Apart from sync problems, the main issue is that the monitor freezes sudenly in the middle of your workout. And all previous and current data and workout information is lost. You have to start from day zero.I wish the customer care service was better and did solve the problems, but they keep saying that they do not know what is happening. It is a shame for Polar company. I am looking for another brand right now.Best RegardsAFAP"
2,Very cheap product,"I have owned older Polar hear rate monitors, my favorite was the S210. Is really cheaply made, belt is integrated into the watch, which is a very bad design, since the belt will be worn out with a year of usage. Overall, I think Polar products have gotten worse over the years. I am glad to see competitor like Garmin with much better products capturing the market they deserve."
4,Good Product,"This Polar RS200 is a good beginning watch. From previous models owned, it has some quick start features that are nice. The most important thing is to take the necessary time to go through the entire set up process and then things work well."
4,"Good performance, easy interface.","I have been using this HR Monitor for about 6 weeks and I like it quite a bit. the interface is easy I haven't had any problems with the watch talking to the strap via a wireless connection, no interference or something like that. It tracks the work outs over time which is nice. Overall I would recommend this to a friend."
4,Works decently,I am happy with this product. There are times when it seems to lose full signal. I don't know if this is the fault of the product or if it is the shirts I am wearing. Overall it is really helpful in my running and training.
5,Tom Jones - Darlin',"this is a fantastic album, being an entertainer myself I have covered three or four of the songs from this album, but would love to get a hold of an original copy, but can't.. Tom Jones truly excels himself here...Kirk James"
1,keep me in mind,"this recording in no way does any justice to mother africa. she sings american songs, with american music and i found it to be a total and complete waste of time and money. a terrible disappointment."
5,"groovy, swinging jazz","Recorded live at The Bohemian Caverns in Washington, D.C., ""The 'In' Crowd"" is The Ramsey Lewis Trio at the peak of their eclectic but popular sound. It has the intimacy and spontaneity of music recorded live, but the precision of music played by those who have talent. A bit bluesy, a bit groovy, swinging, boppy jazz. It's good music for driving, for cooking dinner, as background at a party, and, most importantly, for listening to. There is a generous selection of samples on this site. Try the title track...if you don't like it, you won't like this CD. But if you do, keep going with the Tennessee Waltz, Love Theme from Spartacus, or Come Sunday. I defy your toes not to tap, you to not at least add this to your wish list."
4,"Get ""In"" and get down","This was a hugely successful jazz album that crossed over in the 60's. Undoubtedly a lot of my parent's generation are familiar with this one.I find about half of this cd/album is really upbeat and moving. Very danceable. I can definitely see how this brought new converts into the world of jazz. This is very soulful playing. Dancing. Hands clapping. Feet moving. Head nodding.Then there's the slower songs which are a little too slow for my tastes, and serve to bring the album down a bit for me.Overall though, a good upbeat solid feel-good album.I personally like Ramsey's Greatest Hits on MCA/Chess as a good starting place for people new to jazz."
3,"Interesting, but seriously dated","This book is mostly interesting, from a historical perspective, as it looks into our post- 9/11 mindset. I strongly suspect that Maher would write an entirely different book on the topic today, in hindsight. I can' t imagine he remains comfortable with his attitude about profiling, as just one example. Parts of it were actually uncomfortable to read as we approach the 11 year Anniversary of the attack."
4,It'll make you think,"This book is a collection of essays illustrated with posters that are take-offs on WWII-era posters. Maher challenges us to think about how we have not been asked to sacrifice or step forward in the war on terrorism as citizens were in other wars in our country's past. He also challenges the administration's actions (or lack thereof) on several fronts.I didn't agree with every essay, but I did find each one thought-provoking. Wouldn't it be grand if such a book could spur discussion and action on levels from local to international?"
4,"Outrageously funny, yet thought-provoking !","This is one funny book to read, especially the posters. You're unlikely to agree with everything Maher said in the book but it's guaranteed to make you think and hopefully it will also make you alter some of your behaviors that will at the end make this a stronger nation."
2,Doesn't stand up well over time,"Please keep in mind, my review of this book is just over 10 years after 911 happened. I usually agree wholeheartedly with Maher's point of view but given time to reevaluate 911 with greater hindsight, I would think that even Maher would want a rewrite of this book."
3,Good food for thought,"Maher's book was very eye-opening for me, especiallythe section on ""Why They Hate Us"". Suggestions for fightingterrorism by conserving gas and other sources of energy,as well as thinking twice before buying diamonds, issomething that all Americans should seriously consider. The patriotism and ""who is a hero"" is interesting as well.I didn't like Maher straying into the drug issue (although I agree with his points), and at times he is overly-critical of America, trying to cover EVERYTHING that is wrong with our country in one short book.The format of putting his most provocative statement from each chapter in large print at the end of the chapter was plain laughable. It suggests the reader isn't actually reading the full content.Although I just gave it 3 stars (it's almost a four), I think it is overall a good reality check for Americans."
1,He called US Pilots COWARDS,"This is merely another diatribe from a Hollywood elitist who thinks his celebrity status validates his opinion on anything and everything.Recall that Mr. Maher called US Pilots cowardly for bombing from 50,000 feet, while he never risked his life for his country. You will then understand everything this useless book has to offer."
2,Far below standards for Bill Maher,"This is an over-priced, over-sized edition of some of Bill's philosophy. I love his philosophy, but with the ""poster pages,"" it comes across like an over-priced comic book.His comments are ""right on,"" ... Thus the 2 stars. There's no bang for the buck."
5,THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOK SINCE SEPT. 11TH,"BILL MAHERS'S MASTERWORK IS ONE OF UNEQUELLED INSIGHT,HUMOR,AND PATRIOTISM.EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL SHOULD READ THIS.IT COULD ,IN FACT, MAKE AMERICA SMARTER,STRONGER AND LESS DEPENDANT ON OUR ENEMIES.AS FUNNY AS IT IS BRILLIANT,IT ALSO SHOULD BE READ BY EVERY AMERICAN BECAUSE AGREE OR DISAGREE...THIS BOOK MAKES YOU THINK.BRILLIANT,BRILLIANT BRILLIANT."
2,When You Ride Alone You Still Ride with Bin Laden: What the Government Should Be Telling Us to Help Fight the War on Terrorism -,"While I remain a fan of Bill Maher, ""When You Ride Alone You Still Ride with Bin Laden"" disappointed me. It was hard, if not impossible at times, to distinguish Bill from a Bush-supporter vs a Bush-basher. His arguments and allegiances seemed to be all over the place in this...very easy to read...book. Definitely not his best piece of work."
2,...,"Maher hits on almost as many points as he misses--not unlike his very politically correct Politically Incorrect television show. The man has a brain, but he's just mixed up. His book is overloaded with the usual leftist silliness he shares with Michael Moore et al, but he also strikes a cord of common sense from time to time. Is it worth [the price]? No, but it is worth a read both for the small portions of common sense it occasionally doles out and for the insight it provides into the minds of emotional thinkers."
2,I expected this book to be funny,"Seeing that Maher thinks he's hilarious, I thought he would at least write a book that was mildly humorous. Not so.His attempt at humor is lacking in originality and does not spring from a very deep well. This book does not grab you, compel you, make you look at issues differently, or use humor as a tool to change your perspective on current events. He fails at his primary mission to be funny, and his secondary mission to provide insightful commentary in today's most important issues. Clearly he thought he was being cute and witty in writing this book - too bad it's as flat as yesterday's diet coke.True, the points he is trying to make are good ones, and kudos for the attempt, but as far as political humorists go, this guy is at the bottom of the list."
5,Required Reading,Bill Maher is a living national treasure. I mean it absolutely seriously. Everybody should read this book.
4,"Quick, funny, sharp and true","The basic argument here is that we lack leadership, that we have to create leaders, that we have to demand true leadership and call out those who don't provide it. We have to demand that someone take an unpopular stand (such as saying that we should divorce ourselves from foreign oil in ten years) and support them when they do it.It's all so unlikely and that's the part of the book that isn't funny. We are, as Maher puts it, sheep.But the book is funny. It's very funny and it kept me going for the couple hours it took to finish it. Get it and read it, then write a letter to the White House, the House, the Senate, the Mayor, or whoever you need to direct. If this book gets three people involved in politics other than tacking a damn flag to their Hummer, then it will be worth the paper it was printed on."
1,Not Half as Smart as He Thinks He Is,"At least this book actually IS politically incorrect, unlike Mahrs mercifully departed show. However, he gets too much credit for that. Where he lives and hangs out-- in Hollywood-- this IS the majority opinion. It might not play in Peoria, but Mahr caters to his audience as much as any politician, and there are enough of them to make him rich, just like the other over rated blowhard, Michael Moore."
1,Ridiculous,"Hello! This guy is a comedian. If you want a meaningful hsitoical perspective, read something by Victor Davis Hanson."
2,Nokia Bluetooth Headset Poor Loop + Sound,Two Loops are provided with the head set. The loops are made of hard plastic. Both broke in the same place within 2 weeks. Nothing is provided to put the head set in. Voice recognition is very sensitive any change in tone the name is not recognised. Hearing conversations is good. Volume buttons are little small to use.
3,Works Well But A Litte Bulky and Uncomfortable!,"I used this together with a Nokia 6600 and it worked well communication-wise however it is a little bulky and can get a little uncomfortable if worn for too long. I had no real problem with the ear pieces which are quite sturdy and they have an extra one included as well. Given the wireless headsets that are currently out there which are smaller and more comfortable I'm not sure if these will be popular for long though.However, this particular one works as advertised and perfectly with my Nokia 6600."
2,NOTE THIS IS A LIFT THE FLAP BOOK!,"Was very surprised this was a lift the flap book as there was no indication of that in the title or descriptions / reviews. I am debating returning it. Pictures are very cute but really repeats the same thing page after page. Does an elephant use the potty? No, A bear, No etc. Flaps are separate pages attatched by 1/8 inch seam which my 2 year old could easily rip off if I don't add more tape. Maybe that is why they list it as for 4yr olds... but most of them would not need this book. See The Potty Book for Boys (maybe there is one for girls) by Alyssa Satin Capucilli for a more diverse book. It also has quite durable pages!"
3,Max's Potty,This is a great book that is no longer in print. I would like to see this book back in print so that I could give it as a gift to all the potty training toddlers I know. Sadly the copy that I received had been a library copy and had one of the flaps missing. We loved the book anyway.
5,"Interesting, creative",My 3 year old son has enjoyed this book for 1 year now. The pictures suggest interesting visual similarities and provide a welcome change from the usual text story. very enjoyable for both parent and child.
2,Did Not Work,"I picked the book up because I wanted to see if the author could pull this story off in a believable way. I think he missed the mark, at least with me. The characters where out of a bad 1950's B movie and this lack of character depth plus the far fetched story did not get enough credibility with me. There are many other books out there that a much better, reread a Clancy if you can find nothing else."
2,"Dated and disappointing, but that WAS the 70's.","I had hopes that this collection would make me laugh, but the laughs were few. The ""comedy"" was very dated and disappointing, don't bother to purchase this unless you want to see what happens when network censors control the creative, comedic effort that was Richard Pryor at the time.I recommend his later work that was not controlled by TV censors.This is a nostagic look back and nothing more. It was interesting to see the young faces and developing talent of some of the cast members.The most entertaining part was the ""roast"" and you can see that on YouTube."
4,Extremely Entertaining and Informative,"I really enjoyed this book not only for the romance, but it was interesting to learn about the Natives of Canada. Definitely kept my interest and worth the read."
4,Comics + Science = Geek Heaven,"What a great idea for a book - would super heroes powers work in the real world, and if so, how? A well thought out book that covers a wide spectrum of ideas, with a surprising final chapter on the genius of Carl Barks - a comic book/sci-fi geek nerd like myself LOVES getting more comic book trivia to ""show off"" at the next convention.Perhaps a bit too much time spent explaining stars and black holes...it was well done, but went a little overboard, taking up room that could have been dedicated to the possibility of Adamantium, or an explanation of how a character could fly, or why super heros seem to have white eyes...In summary, a really fun read."
2,Didn't finish it,"It's incredibly rare for me to not finish a book once I start reading; I feel that I at least owe it to the author to get to the end.Couldn't do it on this one. Way to boring.I was excited about reading this as I had read ""Science of Star Trek"" (no idea if it's the same author or not) and found that book to be very good. The author states on the page for the Superhero book that he is on a mission to write one book for every year alive. He is turning into a book writing machine and it shows.Too much detail about things that don't need to be explained, e.g. I do not care about the history of comic books.Boring writing style.I really wanted to give this book five stars because these type of books make science entertaining and fun to learn about."
3,Heavy book,I do not recommend for persons who are just curious for more health info for living. May be students will like it better. Layout and language could be much better.
5,Very educational,Bought this book as a requirement for a fitness nutrition specialist class to add onto a personal training certification. Learned a lot!
2,Should had bought new!,Really disappointed when I received this used book. It was well used! All the page corners were curled and the cover was falling apart. There are also a lot of highlighting marks in the book. Will definitely be throwing it out when I'm done with it because I know I won't be able to sell it.
4,Discovering Nutrition,"The website was pretty user friendly. I tried ordering more text book, but was not able too. I had saved at least $20 ordering thru Amazon on this particular book. Which has help my daughter going to college, this is very much appreciated by all. Thank You."
1,John Williams needs inspiration,"Unlike his previous masterpieces, Harry Potter lacks the magic John Williams used to have."
2,Not a good one,"As the other have said, this movie is not really a Jackie Chan movie. Editing isn't that great (you even see a place where the fudged up). He has a couple good fight scenes but that's pretty much it. If you want it because the story sounds interesting, go for it. But don't buy or even watch this movie just for Chan, you'll be disappointed.If you want a good Chan movie, go get Rumble in the Bronx."
2,THIS IS NOT A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE.,"First off, let me just say that this was not a Chan movie. He may have directed it, but he doesn't appear in the movie until about 20 minutes in or so. On top of that, he is only in one brief (and not too spectacular) fight scene (the scene that lands him in jail actually) that proved to be one of the few fight scenes in the movie. Sammo Hung fans will also be disappointed to find out that not only does Sammo not have a single fight scene, but that he is, at best, a distant supporting character.Despite the fact that this is a bad Chan movie, it's a fairly entertaining movie in and of itself. Chan fans will pass out when they see what happens to Chan at the end though."
2,Not a typical Jackie Chan movie,"This is not your typical Jackie Chan movie. It is not a comedy, Jackie Chan is not the star and he actually dies at the end. This is a prison movie that steals a lot from Paul Newman's 1960's movie ""Cool Hand Luke"", only without the humor. I suggest anyone born in the 70's or 80's rent ""Cool Hand Luke"" for comparison. Paul Newman's version is a lot better. ""The Prisoner"" also steals a scene from Burt Reynold's ""The Longest Yard""Even though this movie isn't very good, (it has all the prison movie cliches) I liked seeing Jackie Chan expanding his range, he can do serious work.To me, the most interesting thing about this movie is recognizing the scenes stolen from other movies."
2,Not very good.,"I honestly did not like this movie. Jackie was the only think that kept me from falling asleep! It was boring and uninteresting. If your thinking of watching it, well don't."
1,"Very , very disappointed","To be kind , this is not, by very far, Jackie's best movie. First: Jackie appears in the movie for less than ten minutes. Second : fights are not as good as his average movie.Third the story could have been developed better. Fourth , the quality of the image is quite low . To finish , the end of the movie is quite sad , like the whole movie, where there's no trace of Jackie's humor."
1,"Jackie Chan is the Prisoner, Indeed","I was disappointed with this movie - I was expecting some Kung Fu action centered around a plot, at least any plot. There is no plot in this movie. It's just The Day-To-Day Life In Prison, which soon gets rather boring and one begins to wonder what the point of the movie is. The ending doesn't really match with the rest of the movie - it's like watching two movies in one. Overall, there's not much kung fu action to be had in this movie. There's nearly more gun shootings than necessary and fist-fighting scenes. The dubbing is also the worst I have ever heard. No attempt has been made whatsoever to match the spoken words with the lip action. Sometimes, I wasn't even sure if it was the character speaking, since the mouth was closed most of the time and the tone of voice did not match the character's demeanor.If you need a movie to put you to sleep, this one will do the job."
2,Cheesy Kung-Fu Movie,"This cheesy kung-fu prison movie, contrary to the box art, does not ""star"" Jackie Chan. Chan and several other Hong Kong actors (like Sammo Hung) reportedly did this as a favour to co-star and producer Jimmy Wang-Yu (""One-Armed Swordsman,"" ""Fantasy Mission Force""). Much of this movie is laughably bad, with goofy dialogue and entire scenes ripped-off from ""Cool Hand Luke"" of all things. Jackie Chan is in the movie for about 15 minutes.The DVD is in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and it looks reasonably good. The dialogue is dubbed, but it hardly seems to matter in a movie like this. There is a commentary by a martial artist and filmmaker named Phillip Rhee that is okay. His historical insights aren't fabulous, but his anecdotes about some of the films stars are enjoyable. Rounding out the extras are some cast biographies and a trailer (which, deceivingly, shows Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung as being the central characters)."
3,The Prisoner,"Not what I thought this movie would be, but oh well. Again there back but with a bad movie. Jackie, Sammo, and some other Chinese people."
2,This is not a Jackie Chan movie.,"This is not a Jackie Chan movie. Jackie Chan is in it, that's for sure, but the extended cast of various action stars makes him just another character.He's not the main character, not that there really is a main character, it seems. The plot, tangled as it is, seems to be about some prison that pretends to execute people and then uses them as assassins. But we only hear about this during the first few minutes and then at the ""climax"" at the end of the movie where Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, Andy Lau and that other guy run around an airport shooting a bunch of people with not much reason. Most of the movie deals with innumerable subplots that serve only to drag out this ordeal.Yes, Jackie Chan shoots people.So we have here a movie with Jackie Chan where you only see Jackie Chan fight a couple times (the highlights of this movie) and then a bizarre climax where pretty much everyone dies.This movie seems far, far longer than the 96 minutes of my life it has stolen."
4,great,"i thought this was a great movie as the sceme gets deeper , i liked it alot as jacky chan was not the main character in the film but a host of characters put together make this a great film"
1,Misleading,"This is my first review, but I just Haaaad to say something. Number one, as everyone has stated, Jackie Chan is only one minor prisoner. Number two, there are TWO Tony Leungs, and the Tony Leung who was in 'Gorgeous' is Tony Leung Chiu Wai, the Tony Leung in The Prisoner is Tony Leung Ka Fai (from 'The Lover'). I can't believe somebody didn't do their research. And number three, you would think that with such a distinguished cast as Jackie Chan, Andy Lau, Tony Leung (Ka Fai) and Sammo Hung, that a better film would be the result. What we actually do have is a muddled, confusing mess. If you like any of the actors involved, or are looking for a good representation of Hong Kong cinema, or just a good action yarn - don't bother."
1,"An Offer Jackie Couldn't Refuse, But Maybe You Should","Bottom line: Jackie Chan owed Jimmy Wang Yu a favor, but apparently so do a lot of people. I wouldn't recommend this movie, but do recommend reading about how it came about in Jackie's autobiography ""I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action""."
2,"A great bit part for Jackie Chan, but a TERRIBLE movie!","The only reason to watch this movie is a pretty good acting performance by Andy Lau, a beautifully choreographed scene between Andy and Jackie, Sammo in a decent role, and the great Jimmy Wang Yu (one armed boxer, one armed swordsman) in a bit part. I thought the ending was just ridiculously stupid as was the entire movie.The commentary makes sure you will watch the dvd twice, but THAT IS IT!!!!! Commentary is not very exciting or anything btu is pretty good and is actually a tad more enjoyable than the movie itself. The guy who directed the Best of the Best movies does it and tells some prettty good stories."
3,GOOD FILM BUT NOT A GREAT MARTIAL ARTS FILM,Jackie Chan fans should be a bit dissapointed with this film. It has one proper fight sene which is excellent but then Chan goes into prison. If Chan had'nt been in this people would of liked it but it is'nt action packed. Luckily enough it has no f words and the gun shooting is very entertaining but if you are looking for a Chan film with plenty of action try Who Am I or Mr Nice Guy.
4,Nice songs from an era where talent was still required.,"There were mostly good songs from days gone by. The radio is a wasteland now, so if you want to hear something. then I guess you have to pay for it."
4,Pure Soul,"My pilgrimage to Tiny Tim consisted of 3 pivotal moments: A radio announcer followed a Karen Carpenter Christmas Song with Tiny's White Christmas, then had the effrontery to ridicule what was clearly the more heartfelt and moving of the two; I met Tiny toward the end of his career when he was working as a clown in a 3rd-rate circus playing the remote corners of the earth (my hometown of Kenosha, WI) and judged him utterly sincere; I discovered the melodramatic music of Bing Crosby in the early 30's along with an epiphany about the source of Tiny's musical inspiration.I do agree with a previous viewer that having Tiny do ""novelty"" songs is at best redundant. But on serious material, he invites being taken as seriously as he takes the material. The style may be different, but as far as I'm concerned he's in the same league as Al Green and Wilson Pickett when it comes to the feeling."
5,Childrens favorite,"I have listened to the gentle swooning of Tiny Tim for 3 Christmas seasons now. Although it's not a hit with adults in the family, All children absolutely Love this album. It's the most requested Xmas CD I own! If you have young children then you should look into this CD."
5,Inspirational,"I have had this CD for about 2 years now and it has inspired my own musicand style. Brett is truly a gifted singer/songwriter as well as an outstanding musician. The ministry written in each song is true to Gods word and His love for His children.I would recommend this and any of his other CD's ( Under the Same Sky from his days in In Reach to Curio, another collection of songs from the 7 Days of Light sessions.) Brett if you read this my family is anxious for your next release...please don't keep us waiting."
3,"Claims to work with all Ipods, but it's not so...","Was supposed to work with all Ipods, but would not work with my older Ipod. Resulted in wasted time and money - dealing with Belkin, getting new one shipped, shipping both back. Dont buy for your older ipod. Looks like a nice product for a new ipod though..... I ended up with a transpod that works, but not as nice as the Tunebase."
1,IT WAS BROKEN,"First of all it is not a Toy the way you think of it, it is a collectible. Second, this has to be the third or fourth e-mail I have received about a review on it.third, It came broken and I do not have it as it went back to UPS and the vendor was not very fast in resolving the situation.Lastly, I am very disgusted with the entire process I had to go through with Amazon and the vendor of this product.PLEASE SEND NO MORE E-MAILS TO ME ON ANYTHING!!!!!"
1,Bratty Little Boy- Short & poor moral message,"I was left with a multitude of feelings after reading this book, if you can call it a book. It is VERY VERY short, too short to even keep a kindergartener interested. One whole page the text is ""no david no"" .The moral message of this book is horrible, its funny that this child mis-behaves? Real junk. The only talent is the artist. Skip this one, there are tons of GREAT books out there, with a GREAT moral story and are amusing and interesting."
3,"Fun, but not a good ""role model""","The book is a fun read, but I am not sure about the ""message"" of the book.David (the main character) is very disobedient and bratty. For 24 pages, David disobeys the teacher, pulls gum out of his mouth, starts (?) a food fight, paints his desk, etc. In the final 5 pages he is finally scolded by the teacher and has to stay after class.The book is fun, but maybe not the type of book you may want to show your kid.I am sorry to say that I did not like David as a character :("
2,Doesn't Quite Cut the Mustard,"The story is a fun one...It's quick and easy for parents to read to their child before bedtime. The illustrations are fun and keep the child interested. But, for the money you're paying for the book, I would like to have more content presented. The story is cute, but less than imaginative. I purchased the story based on Newsweek's recommendation. I do not concur. This is a waste of money to purchase. Check it out from the library. Reading it once IS definately enough."
2,"A Disappointing ""Sequel"" book","I read this sequel to ""No, David"" with great anticipation and excitement. ""No, David"" is one of the all time favorite books that I love to read both for myself and to read at my child's elementary school. The final page, where Davids' mother affirms her love *always* makes me shed at least a tear or two.""David Goes to School"" is NOT such a book. While the author means well, this volume is not anywhere nearly as fresh as his first David book. Indeed, I would say that it borders on being pretentious.If anyone would like another Shannon book to add to their library of childrens lit I would recommend ""A Bad Case of Stripes"". A beautiful book with text that reads smoothly."
4,Bad Boy,"David Goes to School is a story about a boy named David. David really is bad. When he goes to school he is bad for some reason. When you read this book, you should laugh and think this book is really funny. If you want to get in trouble a lot you better get this book. I'M NOT KIDDING. Read it! WARNING: You might be bad after reading this book...Edward B."
4,So Funny!,Another awesome David story! I actually think this is my favorite. The illustrations make even me laugh out loud! It's a quick and easy read and I think both adults and children will love it.
4,David Goes To School,I bought this book for my granddaughter. She loved it. She has all the other books from David Shannon and I also purchased the David Doll for her. The book came in excellent condition and I would certainly order again from amazon.com!
5,Where's David?,"Have you ever told yourself, ""There's got to be a better way!""? Perhaps you have met many Davids and Davitras during your professional educator experiences. Read David Goes to School and I'm sure that you will find a better way for students in your classroom to take ownership of your classroom and school rules. David is a happy and energetic student. He moves through a typical day of school activities seemingly without regards to how his behavior affects those around him. David's teacher guides him firmly through the day while keeping his positive self-esteem in tact.Teacher Note: This story affords teachers the opportunity to build vocabulary, develop classroom rules and consequences, discuss the need for both class community/school community rules and practice conflict resolution skills. Let's remember as educators to dwell on the positive and not on the negative exhibitions of our students. Have a Great 2000-2001 School Year!"
5,LIfe Saver - Roll Out Swivel,"We just recently bought a 37"" flat screen tv. Our challenge was finding at 37"" TV that would fit in our entertainment center. If we didn't have doors that pulled in and out the 37"" TV would have fit perfectly but with the doors the TV was just too wide. So off to Amazon I went to try and find a swivel base. I came across this base and read all the reviews. It seems this item is truly a life saver for those of us with entertainment centers. We ordered it and my husband installed it. It is truly a life saver. This base is hard, core steel. It is nice and sturdy and well worth the money. You can turn it side to side or pull the whole base outside the entertainment center which I love. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Tons of plans,"This is a great book of many, many designs. It's so hard to find good floor plans with a contemporary feel. This book has very clear floor plans and a good artist's drawing of potential finished homes. A must have for the contemporary home lover."
5,Once you pick it up you can't put it down,Anne Shirley has gone to collage!!! In this story Anne Shirley has become a beautiful young woman and has moved away and gone to collage. now she has got suitors every time she turns. But when the right guy comes she refuses! Can she make right before she loses her grip on him forever? This is the one kind of book that you can't put down once you have picked it up.By Christina Skevington199
5,If only...,"I have loved these books since Jr. High, when I identified with bookish, clumsy, often absentminded Anne. I, too, walked around with my head in the clouds! Although I never bought hair dye from a traveling gypsy, nor dyed my nose blue in an attempt to rid it of freckles, I have dumped an entire pan of cake batter into the oven while daydreaming about my future husband (at age 13!), spilled a full container of quick cook oatmeal while imagining I was adopted by my parents (I was really a princess!), and nearly scared my mother to death when at the age of 8 I decided I was old enough to cook and nearly set the house on fire! If you are a dreamy, headstrong girl full of life and mischief, yet loving and full of joy (or know a girl like this), these are the books for you! They are wonderfully written, you can almost smell the flowers and the ocean air, see Anne, and her friends, and wish you could go back in time! If only..."
5,This is a great book!!!,"I liked this book a lot. My favorite part was at the end, when Gilbert proposed to Anne, and they were walking and talking in Hester Gray's garden. I also liked the chapter 'Gilbert Speaks', althougt I felt bad that Anne turned him down. The only part I didn't like , was that they talked about college too much."
5,LOVE IT!!,The best Anne book. Sweet friendships and great romance! I love Phil and Patty's Place! It's a great story that you can't help but love. Read It!
3,Well....,"It was ok, although I thought it could have been much much better. Anne goes through a lot as far as self-realization, especially at the end. My favorite part is when she goes back to her birthplace and discovers the home her parents lived in, in Bolingbrook. Gilbert's character needed more developing, just like it does in all the other Anne books. I think he's a real bore, but wouldn't be if she would just develope him more.I wanted more of a finale too.....more of them talking, etc. It was just too predictable....that she would fall out of love with Roy and go back to Gilbert. I wish she would endeavor more to be ambitious and she and Gilbert would discuss that.There are other Anne books that are better, such as Rilla of Ingleside."
4,Anne of the Island rates a four with me!,"I thought this book was a good book. Towards the end I couldn't put it down because I had to know if it turned out all right with Anne and Gilbert. At the begining I thought I would HATE it but I told myself that all of the ""Anne"" books start kind of slow at least the first two did. So I just read it. And I loved it."
4,We love all the Anne Stories,All the Anne books are amazing. We liked Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea slightly better then this one but we also enjoyed this book. I would recommend it.
2,I didn't like this book too much.,"This book wasn't very romantic in my opinion. I don't think Ruby Gillis was treated very nice in the beginning half of the book. It should have gotten more in about Avonlea, it was too much about college and was kind of boring."
5,Perfect for 5th graders,"My son is totally into these books. They are well written and keeps his interest. These books are highly recommended, as kids are learning this history in school. Makes them want to learn more!"
2,A major let-down.,"""The Journal of Augustus Pelletier: The Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804"" was not a good addition to the ""My Name Is America"" series, and a disappointment for author Kathryn Lasky. I was looking forward to more history, but instead was shown a lot of scenery. After reading this book, I felt like I walked away only reading half of his diary. The beginning started out very good, but by the end, it was as if Lasky didn't know what to write anymore, and decided to stretch it out. The epilogue was also a disappointment. Not even good for beginner learners of this time in history. I do not recommend."
1,There was no Augustus Pelltier!,"Creating historical fiction is a fine art. Where history is known, it should be respected. The opportunity for the historical fiction author should be to fill in the blanks with supposition and to tie together events for the flow of the story. Or, if the work is really a fiction, loosely tied to a real event, that should be made PERFECTLY CLEAR to the reader. This book fails to accomplish either of these goals. There was no person by the name of Augustus Pelltier who accompanied the Corps of Discovery to the Pacific and back. Too many children will wind up with a strangely warped view of this American saga. The tale is so full of adventure and excitement that it easily stands on its own. If the author desired the viewpoint of a young person as the main character, she could have used George Shannon, Sacagawea or Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the youngest REAL members of the expedition. Reader beware!!!"
3,Copy protected,"In the corner of the binding of the cd on the front left bottom corner, you will see a very tiny label listing ""copy control."" It won't play on my computer unless I install the stupid player that's included on the cd. iTunes freezes when I tried to play it at first. I wouldn't have bought this cd if I knew it was copy-protected. I'm currently looking for a work around to get this on my iPod. I didn't even think about BMG being Sony, so now I have to search my computer for spyware. It's funny how the people who actually pay overinflated prices especially for imports are the ones who end up getting punished. I purposely buy products to support the artists, but I don't want to pay for Sony to compromise the security of my computer."
4,José Antonio Mata Marín from Mexico,"Now Within Temptation comes with a new CD, this time we can listen a big diference between this and the past album. The death metal male voices have dissapeared, so that they have lost a kind o power that they showed in Enter. The female voice is excellent, it can mix with the instruments. The new CD is slow but interesting. I would recomend it to people who likes Soft Doom."
3,THI IS OK,NOT THE ALBUM THAT I THOUGHT I WAS RECEIVING BUT STILL OK AND PLAY IT ONCE IN A WHILE. IF U LIKE THEM U MIGHT LIKE IT!
4,"Mother Earth, a MUST of WT","This cd is great with the awesome female vocal make us all down of passion and appreciation at the same time.If you want a cd to listen when you don't feel to well and doesn't want to be alone this cd is for you.Personally I think ""Caged"" is the best song for the lyrics as well as for the instruments hope you'll enjoy it thanks!.-DeMoNsHaDe NaCyToS-"
2,Don't make this your second WT album,"My first experience with(in) Temptation was their latest album, ""Unforgiven"". I loved just about everything about it, especially Sharon den Adel's powerful vocals. As I often do; if I really like an artist, I'll pick up their entire back catalog, but it was a mistake, at least with this album. ""Mother Earth"" is very boring, without the rock influences of ""Unforgiven"". But the worst part is Sharon's voice. It sounds like she's trying to imitate a fairy princess, and the music writing shares this influence. Top-notch instrumentals don't begin to make up for this lack of verve. For those that like the Olde English swords and dragons vibe; this is probably a great album, but it's not for me."
4,Gothic rock for the mainstream,"Within Temptation are a pretty awseome group it has to be said and Mother Earth certainly expands their repetoire towards a more mainstream audience. This type of rock doesn't usually get airtime but with Mother Earth Within-Temptation managed to break out of that mould and achieve hit status, at least, in the Netherlands.Personally I prefer Enter, more dark, more metal, more Gothic, more rock but Mother Earth is still superb album with some wonderful songs and I guess prettier harmonies. Did I see someone describe it as soft-rock? I guess that sums up the difference. Sharon certainly does have an incredible voice, that strikes you instantly, but after an hour you can actually get a bit bored with the high glass-shattering screeching vocals. Anyway, it will be interesting to see what direction their next album takes."
2,what is this junk?,"I'll give you the bottom line up front. Sharon den Adel, the lead vocalist, while very talented is not not suited for this type of work. She is blatantly flat or sharp at varying aspects of Within Temptation's songs including ""Mother Earth."" They do not even have very catchy riffs. Don't buy their album. If you like metal buy metal. If you like emo...kill yourself. If you want to be rocked, either make your own music or find something that does not suck on the surface as well as below it."
5,AWESOME AS EVER !,"I got this record after Silent Force which was the 1st record I got from them only earlier this year. When I heard it I started to tenaciously Hunt for All of Within Temptations stuff and realised they are the Equals of Nightwish and Epica !This record did Not dissapoint at all, and is why I continued buying Everything from this Goddess band !Everything about it is top class, and again no bad or mediocre tracks.Just wished my coppies cover design was the same as the one shown here, coz the design on the one I got is Crap. Its an Insult and a Blasphemy to this Godly band.You dont get better Melodic/Symphonic metal than Within Temptation"
3,"I bought this because of the glowing reviews on here and,","I was a little disappointed truthfully. I love these kinds of bands for the most part as they all give the listener an enjoyable ride. Bands like Leaves Eye's, The Gathering, Nightwish, Laguna Coil etc have always been favorites of mine and so I figured, that this one would be in that vain and it was to some extent.I found the tunes on here flowed alone nicely and they are well executed. However I also found the singer gets lost in the mix and to be honest, although she's a good singer, I found that her voice was lacking something. I can't put my finger on it, but she just seems to be lacking some girth in her delivery if that makes any sense? I guess what I'm trying to say here is, she has no balls in her delivery!Overall I enjoyed it, but I thought it would be better than it was. The tunes rock and are well put together, but the singer gets on my nerves after a while."
4,"Very very good, but not a masterpiece.","The album itself lacks originality, even though professionalism is not such a breakpoint for this brand of metal.gothic metal was never meant to have mind-blowing solos or heavy catchy rhythms. But there are many bands who has the ability to make Gothic metal so progressive and majestic (Evergrey,Crematory,Tiamat,Tristania,Nightwish). I like this album a lot, i just wish it would be more original in a sense when you hear their music their harmonic chord progressions are so obvious. But nevertheless great album that deserves to be in your collection."
5,excellent music,"If you like Evanescence, you will love Mother Earth. It is a wonderful album that can carry you away."
3,Okay.,"Not WT's best by any means, but at least this album has personality unlike ""The Silent Force"". Theres a few good songs such as ""Our Farewell"", ""Ice Queen"", ""Mother Earth"" and ""Caged"". But the rest of the CD does not follow. ""Perfect Harmony"" sounds like a pre-school, sing-along song, and ""Never-Ending Story"" sounds like a folk song gone horribly wrong. All in all, the album isn't terrible...but it isnt the best."
2,Needs a new singer,"I gave this a 2 star rating because Sharon den Adel can not sing. This would be a perfect band if they found a new singer, this album is horrible with her. I thought she sounded decent on one song and she's not that great on the first album either. She sings off key all the time (especially when she starts singing high) and I have no idea why this got such a good rating."
4,More of a zester,"This works great but is a much finer grate then I realized from the picture, more of a zester really."
5,Best hand grater we've owned so far,We bought this hand grater to replace an aluminum hand grader with a looped rolled aluminum handle. That honestly was a pain to use.This grater has a very comfortable handle and does an excellent job compared to what we had been using.I would recommend this and all of the OXO Good Grips items to any of my Family and friends.
4,Excellent third stream majors on a classic LP,"Don't like term ""Third Stream"" or even ""Cool Jazz"" for that matter (though with some folks at certain times like Miles or Mulligan latter term applies).But this is an Lp of guys who went there own way.It's among the classics of the Prestige label in 50's (only better known is Teddy Charles Tentette on Atlantic).Nice relaxed and sophisticated jazz.Shorty Rogers was studio magician (and from my home town Great Barrington Mass born one Milton Rajonsky)and very adaptable from being band leader,film and session ace.Jimmy Giuffre is the one most associated with ""third Stream sound.And they have some guy named Mingus on bass.If you like it check out his other collaborations with some of same personnel.I also.I liked Teddy Charles ""Vibe Rant"".Good if your into vibes for sure.Check out Jazz Foundation Of America in these hard times.Chazz"
1,What a letdown!,"Gee - with all the hoopla DJ Empire generated with respect to this long-awaited Moroder tribute, one would have thought it would contain a set of killer remixes on 2 cds as advertised. I waited and waited for it to be released - then finally bought a copy only to be painfully dissapointed to discover it was a very expensive SINGLE CD, and what's worse, all the cuts are short, seemingly edited versions rather than full-length remixed versions which most Moroder fans would have preferred anyway. Perhaps DJ Empire will get it right next time around. Until then, don't waste your money on this expensive hype."
3,Correction to album description!,"This is a one-disc set only, not two as described above. If you like synth-laden cheesy handbag house you'll love this, otherwise tread carefully. Particular offenders include the dire Amanda Lear version of From Here To Eternity, Take My Breath Away (did anyone want a cover of this?), Call Me (come back Deborah Harry!), and all the Donna Summer covers. Jam & Spoon and Thee Maddkatt Courtship partially redeem things, but most of this sounds regurgitated and relentless."
2,Not the best of the Maisy books,"My 2-year-old daughter adores Maisy. We have many of these books, and I read a couple of them during our bedtime routine. My daughter also loves flipping through some of the books and ""reads"" them to herself.This one in particular, though, is not a favorite; my daughter never chooses this one, and there isn't much of a reaction when I read it to her. And, I must say, the ""plot"" is even more nonsensical than usual for Maisy books. It just seems random. And, evidently, my daughter feels the same way! The bedtime one is the best one, according to my daughter."
5,How can you go wrong with Maisy?,"Yet another short and fabulous tale of our favorite female mouse. As always, love the bold colors, simple text, and realistic topic. All three of my kids have been big fans of the Maisy series, and here is yet another I would highly recommend!"
3,Spring Cleaning at Maisy's,"If you are the parent of a young child, you probably know who Maisy is. She's a mouse with a duck, a squirrel, an elephant, and a crocodile for friends. Why the crocodile isn't trying to eat the others is beyond me, but that's life in Maisy's world.Both of my daughters love the Maisy books; there's something about their simple stories and colorful pictures that even appeals to adults. The books are short and easy to read. But, the stories are never obnoxiously simplistic, like so many other books for small children.However, this is one of my daughters' least favorite Maisy books. Perhaps because they aren't too keen on cleaning up themselves (what two year old and four year old are?). Anyway, Maisy is cleaning her house when she gets some help from a surprise visitor. Who could it be? Hey, read the book if the suspense is killing you."
2,It was fine while it worked,I got this flash for a sweet 16 I was going to do for a friend and it stopped working when I got to the event! It was past the warranty but when I explained the malfunction the company was great and exchanged it. The new one I got got the battery cover broken and I wasn't able to fix it :(
3,Not really waterproof,"I really wanted a waterproof backpack for my daughter because it rains alot in Maryland where she is at college, but when it really pours down rain, the books and stuff inside still get wet. Otherwise it's a good backpack."
4,A Human side,"I've seen alot of movies about the life of Martin Luther King Jr and the Boycott that woke up the civil rights movement, but what I like about this movie is it put a human side to everyone in the file. Civil Right leaders are looked at and portrayed as icons. This movie made them human, putting the realistic touch needed for our youth to know and believe the truth of the events of the not so far past."
3,A good movie,The only bad point was when people looked at the camera and talked. I learned a lot though.
4,Story is a bit romanticized,"Good historical overview, although MLK's storyline is way over-romanticized. Would have liked a different actor playing his role. Production style is a little artsy-fartsy &, IMHO, a mistake."
3,Not a great tool!,"Missing Honey is not a good book to teach young children about the importance of being honest, and trust worthy. I did have high hopes for this one; however, it was a bit of a letdown."
5,Annoying but Good,The rhyming is annoying. The message is good. Do not jump to conclusions and blame.
1,Steamin',"Any drummer deprived of hearing this recording is likened to a person being deprived of his morning orange juice - forever. It is not all about the band - the crowd is wild - & the 2 drum solo / challanges on the recording are a must hear for every living musician & anyone else that can apreciate 7,543 ways to treat your snare drum with love."
5,Wonderful Book !!,"This book was great. So many facts about the movie, the play, and the actors. Grease is my all time favorite and I collect anything I can get my hands on from the movie and I am glad I added this book to my collection. This is a must have for any nostalgic Grease fan. I have a few books on Grease and I have to say this is a fun one. Lots of things about the movie I didnt know so if you are as big a Grease fan as me get yourself a copy !!!"
5,grease memeries,"I liked this book because its alot of fun, I loved the cast why: there my favorite. I loved the acts they did and dancing they did too. Iliked this paper back why: because Its alot of fun on stage back. learning is alot of fun,dj's dance contest, actting, making new friends, making boy friends, are fun. in this reviw I liked this play why: because you can make the difrentce."
1,A Waste of Time,"The best thing I can say about this title is that it is better than nothing. These contracts are short and lacking in any real substance. Moreover, there is no analysis whatsoever regarding key contract provisions. Buy ""This Business of Music"" instead."
5,Perfect for all!,"No matter what area in the music or recording industry you are in, these contracts are absolutely relevant. I found them extremely useful for my company and have highly recommended it to others in the industry. I would suggest that anyone who needs help with contracts purchase this product, you won't be sorry."
1,does not work for phone calls,The microphone howls as soon as the phone connects to thenetwork. Works great for games or radio.
5,The Man in the Black Suit,"Excellent Service.The product is in excellent condition. I am sure that I willenjoy it much. Delivery was in a very timely manner.Thank you so much,Dee"
3,Waste of money,"Every single story in this collection was already published not long ago in the book Everything's Eventual. If you are a serious King fan you've already read these last year. If you are a superfan then you read them all when they appeared in various magazines. In other words, there's nothing new here. Instead of buying this why not just buy an audio edition of Everything's Eventual? This was just a gimmicky waste."
2,snore fest,"4 dark tales. dark apparently means boring. Not scary, not clever, not his best work. I'm a huge King fan but this was terrible (worse even than From a Buick 8).Dare I say, he's retiring just in time. The idea well is dry."
3,The Man in the Black Suit,"This intriguing little collection of short stories is fun, but not my favorite of King's work. In the title story of this small collection, a young boy runs into the devil on a fishing trip. Pretty far-fetched, but King has the knack to make it seem real. The three other stories are a little less outrageous and deal with more mundane subjects. As always, the King character development skills are in full bloom here, but the plots of these stories don't have the usual twists and turns, and are more predictable. The narrators are excellent storytellers who add a lot to the interpretation of the stories."
1,Don't Even Go There,"While it was an interesting idea to record the songs from ""Inside DaisyClover"" and ""Valley of the Dolls"" this was a real miss.David Pasucci lacks the range to pull this off. I'm sure itwill be appearing in the bargin bin before it hits the shelfof your local record store.You'd do better to get the Original Soundtrack album from ""Valley"" (now available on CD) or even a 1968 version by Patty Duke herselfreleased through United Artists called ""Patty Duke Sings Songsfrom Valley of the Dolls and other Selections"" which may be hard to find but it's worth it."
1,the cheap version,"sorry it's horrible! the sound, the voice and all versions of daisy and valley of the dolls songs are completely lost...it was a good idea to recorded again the andre previn songs but unfortunetly it's a disaster in this case! sorry for david pascucci but it'll be beter to remove his CD from the music market.."
1,Good sharp knife until it breaks,"I bought this knife about a year ago, and I loved it. It's very sharp and it has a good grip. While I was cutting some cooked pork with it last week and thinking how good this knife was, the blade broke out from the handle and tipped over to my hand (luckily it was the dull side!). I still think that the blade is very good, but I just don't understand why can't they make the construction better. There's a good review on the OXO MV-55 Pro 3-1/2-Inch Paring Knife that talks about the poor construction of the OXO knives. It is not a very expensive knife, so I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Blue eyes, golden touch","The directors and writers have expertly cast Hugh Grant in this amusing unlikely comedy. In his now familiar ""fish out of water"" role Grant plays an auctioneer in America. His very Englishness has won him the heart of a local schoolteacher who is reluctant for Grant to meet the family. Reason being the family are ""the family"". Cue many hilarious episodes as Grant gets himself dragged deeper and deeper into the mobs way of life the more he tries to be straight. Despite his girlfriends warning to stay away he does one small favour, then another and so on. Although 4 weddings is now a British classic and Notting Hill was probably funnier, this has the best storyline, including an ingenious ending and some great acting by Grant. Best of all it's a good old fashioned family film that won't offend the kids."
5,HILIARIOUS!,"This is a very endearing movie, great for a romantic night at home. Although it's typical ""Hugh"" - you will still enjoy the exchanges between the characters. Surprise ending. Great soundtrack."
3,Stick to British Movies,"I love Hugh Grant. He has charisma to spare and is a master of self deprecating humor. This is the first non-British movie I've seen him in and though it included elements of British movies like over the top characters and farce, here it just didn't work. The story line, main cast, and acting were all good, but the execution not. Though normally a film is five stars simply by having Grant in it, here I felt bad for him, especially the italian/mafia accent, to the point of FF/ skimming through the last 1/3 of the movie to get it over with. Now, off to rent a About a Boy, so that, as for this movie, I can fuggeddabouttit."
2,Good cast wasted on a mediocre script,"Hugh Grant had a hard act to follow after 'Notting Hill' and this film didn't do the trick. Grant's comedic talent and dry wit were not enough to help this inane script. Like this year's other mafia spoof, `Analyze This', this comedy about a proper English auctioneer marrying into the mob isn't sure whether it is trying to be serious or slapstick. Unfortunately it fails at both.Grant provides the film's only redemption, scattering laughs sparsely through the film through sheer talent. Jeanne Tripplehorn looks terrific in a red slip and did a credible job of making this resemble a romantic comedy. James Caan's dramatic talent was wasted in his vacuous role as the prospective father in law. Probably the best performance was turned in by Burt Young playing the serious don as Uncle Vito.I rated this film a 5/10. The film has its moments, but not enough of them. For Hugh Grant fans, it's worth a look. Otherwise you might want to pass."
4,Hilarious,"I liked this Movie a lot , because it's kind of different than the others which are typic action and American . Even if there was not a lot of action in it like an authentic american movie , it could put you in front of the screen all along the movie ."
2,Not Good Enough,A movie with a script that has a potential ! It is promising a certain degree of entertainment but Later on the movie bores the heck out! The Mob family concept in the movie is far beyond being entertaining. In other words I'd definately Rent the DVD then Buying it!
2,MASTERFUL NOTHINGNESS,"Hugh Grant is not too offensive in this role. He is not too cutesy here, and that is something for which to be thankful. In the film Grant's character Michael is engaged to marry Gina, the daughter of an Italian-American mobster (played by James Caan). Michael is a successful auctioneer, and after his engagement to Gina, Gina's father starts using Michael and his connections to the art world to launder money. Soon the FBI is onto the scheme (with Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson as a particularly funny FBI officer). Michael attempts to hide these dealings from Gina (Michael of course did not want to get involved with all of this illicit activity in the first place but was railroaded-it is the mafia after all). When Gina finds out their relationship crumbles. An accident causes even more problems, potentially fatal ones. Overall this is not a great movie and not even particularly funny. However, you will be able to sit through it and maybe get some entertainment value from it."
3,"A sweet, light hearted comedy","1999 sent out a splew of mobster comedies. I saw this one and said ""Hey, why not give it a chance."" I saw it and I was glad. It's not GREAT, but it was okay. Not a movie you'd recommend or maybe even see again. It's just an all around, little funny comedy. Worth seeing at least once. Stars Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan and Scott Thompson."
4,Mickey Blue Eyes,"Hugh Grant is a master at playing light romantic comedies with his befuddled charm and you don't have to be a fan of his to enjoy this movie. The rather simple plot is secondary to the characters, all chiches for sure but also well-played by the very recognizable cast. The members of my family had fun watching it, partly because we didn't expect too much after all the put-downs by critics, and we were pleasantly surprised that it was actually quite humrous."
3,Good comedy,This is not a great film buts its good and will have you laughing.The film starts off great then about 3/4 though it takes a wrong turn and doesnt have a great ending but an ok ending.The whole cast is good but Jeanene Tripplehorn I can't belive people are still hiring her.
2,Had some flaws.,"This film wasn't that satisfying to me. I was honestly ready for it to end for quite some time before it did. Micky Blue Eyes didn't seem to know whether or not it wanted to be a comedy or if it wanted to be serious. The film was confusing, too coincidental, silly, and unbelievable. The cast was all decent in their roles though. Some people may get a kick out of Micky Blue Eyes, but to me it wasn't that captivating. There's a funny moment here and there, but that was rare. I managed to sit through the whole film; so it wasn't completely bad in other words, but it did have some flaws that I've already mentioned. Try something else. I actually give this 2.5 stars."
1,"not good, not good at all","Mmmmm, yes Hugh plays a bumbling English cliche. And guess what? He falls in love with an American! Wow. Now for the twist - she is the daughter of a gangster - so there's the cue for more cliched stereotypes - ooooo the hilarity of it all. You can imagine the fun that ensues, yes that is right IMAGINE, keep it in you imagination by all means, but do not under any circumstances view first hand - I feel that I have done penence for the world by watching this. PS - Any Americans reading? Please stop asking us poor Brits to say 'forget about it'"
5,Excelent Reference and Teaching Tool,"Succeeds where Brian Kernighan's ""The C Programming Langauge"" fails. Concise enough to use as a handy reference for the veteran C programmer, yet robust enough to include examples for most programming constructs. Highest reccomendation."
3,"Thorough, but very dense and dry","I bought this book while looking for a good text to teach kids how to code C. This is pretty much a college/professional level book. The reading is very dense and quite dry, though the author does a very good job of breaking down simple programs and explaining them.If you want to learn C inside and out and heavy reading is your bag, this might be the book for you, however, I would recommend Bjarne Stroustrup's C++ book as a better alternative."
1,Save Your Money; Buy Something Else,"The book is terrible. It is not helpful in learning C, and it makes a horrible reference after you have learned C. What other use does it serve than to be cast into outer darkness?"
5,"The most useful, thorough, and readable book on ANSI C.","I learned C with this book. I think it's not too bashful to say that it is the best C book on the planet. Here's why:A. The authors spare no ""idle talk"" in getting their point across.B. The material is very readable and very organized.C. Programming dissections, computer science concepts, data structures, even operating system ideas are all contained in this wonderful, small (easy to carry) text.ABC - A Book on C. get it?? ;-]In short, I highly recommend this book to students, professionals, and just about anyone who wishes to learn the syntax, the semantics, and more importantly, the APPLICATIONS of the ANSI C programming language"
3,Hope it's the one,"I am a Matlab/Simulink enthusiast and I wanted to brush up on my C. I found that this was the book used to teach 'Advanced C Programming' at Purdue ECE so I went for it. The reviews on Amazon are extremely positive, and I am looking forward to a good read once the book arrives. I will post my findings and update my rating soon. So far so good."
5,"Buy it, it's great","I am a beginner to computer programming and have gained so much knowledge from the book that i have already started a job as a programmer, after six months of reading the book."
3,Gourmet,"The jelly beans were tasteful and very flavorful, however, when I received my package the jelly beans were all mixed in with each other and that was a big disappointment to me. The jelly beans should have been sealed into each square..it doesn't seem to be 50 flavors..there are some empty squares."
5,Yum...what more can you say?,"Jelly bellys, you are so delicious. I bought these for my hubby as a Bday gift, and ended up rediscovering some delicious favors myself. It's not often you find cappuccino-flavored or strawberry daiquiri-flavored candy. Love these things!"
3,Pleasant but far from amazing,"John Fahey was a major guitarist, both for his own work and for his influence on Leo Kottke, among others. But he also was a bit too eager to release (or in the case of this CD, re-re-release) material. This is nice background music, but as a demonstration of his technique or fire, well, nope.I have a huge collection of Christmas music, and the different sounds fill different needs. Some are stirring and vibrant (think Christmas Cantata), some, like Odetta, dig deep and touch strong emotions, some are cheerfully goofy and nostalgic, like Bing or Dean. But this is just a little too whitebread, the kind of thing that you barely notice, just hums along amiably and suddenly disappears...Uh, oh, need another CD.Traditional tunes, traditional arrangments, traditonal playing. Nice enough, but that's all."
1,Don't waste your money,I just bought 4 guitar christmas albums. I almost threw this out the window. Pure garbage. Do not waste your money on this.
2,censored,"Face it, these kind of movies exist only for the sex and nudity, so what on earth possesses the idiots who put such films on DVD to cut out the original sex and nude scenes? It's like cutting Godzilla out of a Godzilla movie. What's left? A hot video becomes a boring DVD because these morons think they can improve the original movie by slicing out most of what the viewers want to see. (They did the same thing with ""Secret Games"" and many other sexy videos when they came out on DVD.) What a waste. Get the video, or wait until these jackasses wake up and release the original uncut version on DVD."
2,DVD version of Sexual Malice,"The DVD version is ""R"" and most of the totaly hot scenes are much edited. I emailed and called the company with no response. Stick to the unedited video version. You'll be much happier. Its totally hot."
3,Loose but with direction at least.,"Intrigue and double dealing in the corporate world of advertising is the backdrop for this so so would be erotic flick. As for the erotic content, there's some but could have been more. The lead bad guy is John Loughlin (remember him, the DIY sleuth from the 1985 Ken Russell flick 'Crimes of Passion'? with Kathleen Turner). Not a bad actor at all but never really recognised. Kathy Shower, Playboy's Playmate of the year 1986 is here to co-starring as his long suffering...wife.You could do worse than watch this film but all in all it's an assemble yourself by the numbers story which you hve to work with to enjoy. Loughlin woos female assistant then dumps her. She commits suicide but her long lost sister investigates Loughlin for purpose of revenge.I've seen worse. highlight is Kathy Shower's love scene with Loughlin."
3,Deseption.,I love the story of deseption of a married couple and why they theat on each other in this movie.Because! It shows us a lesson on what can happen when married couple's don't fallow the rules.
4,A time for change.,"These couple of years are a time when everything changes. She finds new friends, is teaching, and helps others find each other again. She still has her wild imagination to go with her hair and her temper. She is still trying to find out more about the mysterious Gilbert Blythe, and is finding him more than just a friend."
5,Wonderful Book for all ages!,"I read this book when I was 12 and loved it. Now I'm 21 and recendly read it again, and I liked it even more. The plot is great. The characters are alive, and the writing is superb.A must for anyone that wants to laugh, love and cry with the town from Avonlea."
3,Here's Why,"I really enjoyed the first Anne book, but the second was a bit dull. It was still nice, but Anne and Gilbert's relationship doesn't go anywhere!!! So if you want to read an Anne book where it does, I strongly recommend Anne of the Island. I just didn't find this novel as capturing as I had hoped. Maybe it was too much description. I always have a problem with too much of that. While reading I had to keep skipping ahead to see when the next time Gilbert would even be mentioned!!! So like I said, it was okay."
3,Anne of Ingleside---just better than average,"This story is not as boring as 'Anne of Windy Poplars' but not really fascinating.First, I don't like Montgomery mainly wrote about Anne's children.Second,I can't understand why Anne's life has to be sacrificed to Gilbert and her children.The unpredicable Anne of Green Gables,Avonlea,Prince Edward Island has now disappeared completely.She is just an ordinary housewife whose business is to take care of her family.No more funny adventures. Fortunately,the ending is better.Anne is back to the Anne of Green Gables ."
2,Why is this novel so dull?,"I thoroughly enjoyed Anne of Green Gables, but Anne of Avonlea is devoid of all that made the first lively and captivating. We rarely see the world through the descriptive lens of Anne's eyes and colorful words in the second book as we did with the first. Instead we are bludgeoned over the head with narrative bucolic scenery after narrative bucolic scenery. Gone is the tension between Anne and Gilbert and gone is the hilarity of Anne's growing pains, and no sympathy is created for the twins Anne and Marilla have adopted. It's as if Montgomery has dumped them into the story and left them there to fend for themselves. I am only halfway through, but the narrative has become so tedious and dull with scenery and very little story, that I may not be able to wade through what should have been edited and rewritten."
4,Anne of Avonlea bok Reveiw,I really enjoyed this book! It was very interesting once I got involved. I like Anne's personality and at times it was very funny. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading.
5,Another Delightful Anne Story,"Since Anne is no longer a little girl in Anne of Avonlea, I was expecting the deligtful flavor of Anne of Green Gables to gone from the saga. I was pleasantly suprised. The wit and whimsy that was so common in Anne of Green Gables is even stronger in Anne of Avonlea. Anne never ceases to amaze me with her creative view on life. This is also a very positive story, and the emotional ending nearly brought me to tears. Another must-read in the world of Anne."
5,A great story with colorful pictures!,"The sequel to Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea is just as good as the first. Anne is older now, and she becomes a teacher at the town school, Marilla and Matthew adopt little boys, and Anne's relationship with Gilbert ripens. If you have not read Anne of Green Gables, I recommend reading that first, so you can understand this book better.This version of the book is hardback and VERY colorful, which I really enjoyed, and it is a book from the Illustrated Junior Library Editions. It comes with a plastic covering to protect the book. This book along with Anne of Green Gables would be a great book for any young girl, and can be passed down to the next generation."
5,It is a GREAT book! I couldn't put it down.,"This is one of my favorite books, along with the rest of the series. It is about a red haired girl named Anne. She loves romance and is full of adventure of spunk. She and her bossum friend Diana are always into some adventure or another. I advise you to read this book!!!!!!"
2,Disappointment,"It seems that Montgomery didn't know what to fill this book with. There are some nice stories about Anne's children (who are very sweet kids indeed), but there is also the extremely boring chapter about the gossipy Ladies' Aid meeting, or the too lengthy presence of the personage of aunt Mary Maria. Anne herself has turned into a common housewife, and there is nothing left of the good naughty little girl with the great imagination or the clever and ambitious young woman. Gilbert is a doctor, Anne is ""Mrs Doctor"", and we almost forget about the earlier school and college competions between both of them, where they are equal and both interesting. Reading the previous books one could think Anne would become a famous writer, not just the shadow of man she loves. She is really a wonderful mother and wife, but she could be these things without losing her personality too."
2,anne of ingleside,"Since this book was in hardcover, I was assuming, in the lack of a date or description, that it was an earlier edition. What I got was a cheap-looking modern edition that I never would have bought if I had had information as to the publication date, which was never listed. I don't like being exploited like this. Books should be advertised with dates."
4,Anne of the Island,"In Anne of the Islnad, the character that I have grown to love and become familiar with, grows up and moves on to college. With college, comes new friends and new romances too. The only part that continued to annoy me was how Anne was rejecting everybody who asked her to marry. However, Anne learns through her failures and to my contentment, ended up with the one person whose heart truly belongs to her."
1,The Worst,"The narrator is the worst; she makes this book imposable to listen too. At first it was funny, but then I thought about how much money I wasted on the book, and how I knew I could never listen to it, then it was not funny anymore. Save your money, otherwise it is ""your money or your sanity."""
5,A VERY NICE FOLLOW UP - GOOD READING,"Being a L.M. Montgomery fan helps of course, but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the Anne of Green Gables which started it all. The writing hold true to the author's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series. My wife and I have been reading these books for years and never tire of them. Again, as with her first work, you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time. This particlar story starts where the last left off, Anne is sixteen and her adventure continues. I, for some reason, find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly."
5,Jen,"I loved this book. I admit I love all the Anne books, but this one is one of my favorites. I loved hearing about her children and more about what is going on in Anne's head. It is a sweet book."
1,Boring Boring Boring!,How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction. I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said.I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books. At least the movies keep your interest.
5,Writings on the Wall,"This CD is awesome. It has everything you could want, and more, literally!! It has all the 16 tracks the original ""The Writings on the Wall"" has *plus* 2 of their first hits ""No, No, No, No"" & ""Get on the Bus"". With hot remixes of ""Say my Name"", ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" & ""No, No, No, No"". Get this CD, and you'll have the best ""Destiny's Child"" collection out there."
2,Weak,It doesn't have the power I was looking for - would be alot better if kthe jet hit the ball of your foot. Just a tad better than a bason of water
5,DR.

4,More Paddy Ashdown than Tony Blair,"The whole album has a wonderful, thick sound. I docked it a star because I thought the songs didn't flow into each other very well, and because some of the synthesizer sounds are dated. Nitpicking (and it is nitpicking) aside, if you like Parliament, you'll like this, and if you liked Parliament but always thought they could have been 20% jazzier, you'll love this. In addition to those elements, Bernie throws some rock, classical, hip-hop, and gospel (and maybe other stuff I haven't picked out yet) into the soup.Among the many guest artists: George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, Bill Laswell, Maceo Parker, Tony Williams."
4,Works very well,"This bottle opener is excellent. The rubber grip is very non-slip, minimizing possible injuries normally incurred when opening bottles. This is very popular at parties at my dorm."
5,Why does this release sound so much better than any other?,"Usually, when soundtracks are released, they are incomplete, and out of sequence, and just don't sound right. That is Not the case here.This version is not complete, but...I bought the 1997 - 2 CD Special Editions of Episodes IV, V, and VI. They Sound great, and they Are complete, but they are just Not Enjoyable.This is the original. It may not be technically perfect, but it is the enjoyable release. This is one of the few soundtracks that can be heard over and over, and never get tired of it. It is just fantastic. I love it.Thank You John Williams. You are awesome."
5,Works well. Nice handle with Oxo signature rubber handle.,"Love this. Works well nice design and excellent workmanship. The metal surface has drain holes which is a nice thought and also a aerated edge which I don't fully understand but assume it is for cutting into meat...and if so, I still don't understand as why would anyone cut meat on the grill?"
4,Amost Perfect,The good features have been mentioned by other reviewers and I agree with all of those comments.I took one star due to the cutouts in the spatula blade. The only purpose I can think of for the holes is a reduction in the weight of the blade but I think the difference is far too slight to offset the trade-off of less convenient cleanup. The inside perimeter of the holes can hold stubborn bits of dried sauces and grease. I need a stiff brush and then closer inspection to be sure they are clean.
3,Add to business school reading list,"I hope my accounting professors have read this. This is for everyone who ever feared being labeled an apostate for speaking the heresy about conflicts of interest between Big 5 auditors and consultants and also investment bank analysts and underwriters.The book may strike some as self-righteous, but politics aside, this is good insight and plain talk from an insider. I hope Levitt's ""Chinese wall"" becomes a frequent discussion topic at business schools.I listened to the Audible version and from that perspective, I found the reading a little disorganized. I would have appreciated more references to the overall timeline and big picture, but that is always a risk with any audio version of a print book."
1,Title is more aggressive than the content.,"The book is full of inside stories of corrupt corporations and the SEC's involvement to correct them. As far as any portfolio use, chapter ten is 26 pages of 401(k)tips. Otherwise there was nothing truly useful for investing. I am self-employed, so this one chapter was of no help to me either. No disrespect to Arthur Levitt and his understanding of the market but this is more of a non-fiction or autobiography than a guidebook to ""Take On The Street."" If you like direct and helpful books such as the ""All About ...."" series of books by Richard A. Ferri or William Bernstein's style, you should overlook this one and it's similarly named clone."
2,A Hybrid Book That Leaves Much To Be Desired,"There are a few good moments in this book and I must confess I am only half way through it. But what blew me away was what I read in the acknowledgements. Mr. Levitt, a former stockbroker, credits Warren Buffett with informing him about the core of broker comepensation and mutual funds compensation. Gee, didn't Mr.Levitt know the core of these issues when he was at the SEC? It just strikes me funny that a long time vetern of the securities industry would tip his hat to Buffett on such basic issues. Outside of this the book is a gathering of books that combines the worst in biography, advice and expose. Mr. Levitt admits that his poweres were limited by Senators like Phil Gramm, but his book is also limited with few insights worth paying for. Two stars for the insider scoop, but it is really a one-star book!"
2,Self-Serving,"Reading the book was slow and painful. I'm sure Arthur is a very nice man and honest, but did he have to go on for over 200 pages making that point. I think he wanted this book to be a learning experience for the reader, but unfortunately it turned into a self-serving narrative about the things he could not fix and his buddies.Maybe next time."
1,Too Little Too Late,"First of all, readers will know most of the information in this book by reading the headlines in recent newspapers. The behind-the-scenes material is interesting, but it is so weighted in the author's favor that it lacks a sincere element of truth. Instead of writing a book about what investors don't know about Wall Street, I wish Arthur Levitt would have spilled the beans while he was the SEC's chairman. To make money by writing a book based on what he should have told investors long ago does not sit well with me. As an investor, I feel cheated and as a reader of this book I felt like the message was too little, too late!"
1,Too Slow For Motion,"Take on the Street bogs down in detail, which makes reading it a lesson in patience. It is often hard to see the forest for the trees. One of the most interesting facts in the book was how Levitt got his job. He says he contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clinton campaign. It seems that the best person for any job in Washington is the person who raises the most cash!"
3,Good book,"I found this to be a informative if depressing read. For all the one star reviewers, Levitt did speak out during the Clinton administration. But politics aside the book offers a behind the scenes view of the SEC and its relationships with Congress, FASB, industry etc. The view is not a good one. Read it and take heed. Hopefully it will help prevent another Enron. Maybe people will finally learn about financial mania."
1,A Sales Job,Page after page says Levitt is like a God when it comes to helping average investors. Give me a break. This is such one-sided reporting that it made me ill to read. A balanced approach has been thrown out the window for a PR campaign filled with errors. Destined for the bargin bin!!
2,Half A Book,"The first half of the book was very informative on the inner workings of Wall Street. The last half seemed to fall into more of a political mode. Mr.Levitt allowed his democratic leanings to show when he started to blame republicans for his failures. The democrats were given forgiveness for ""unwittingly"" pressuring him. Last but not least, the book ends with a self serving letter from none other than Tom Daschle.Read this book if you can get it for half price."
1,A Sleep Aid,"First, investors as a group are not going to take on Wall Street. The idea is unrealistic and the information in this book does not meet the muster of news anymore, because most of it has already been reported. The writing style is boring and slow to the point of sleep. I regret buying the book!"
1,fox in the henhouse,"It is pretty hard to stomach that someone who knew just how serious investors were being huckstered through the boom, and was the one person who could have brought some honesty into the picture, didn't. Now he wants to sell his advice. I'd rather believe Abbie Hoffman (Never trust anyone over thirty)"
1,Another Clinton stooge who looked the other way,Nothing in the book about the dot.bom scam which was the biggest financial scam in history. $500 billion stolen from the public. The scam sucked the little guys in on IPO date when the shares were traded by investment banks and hedge funds to the moon. The whole thing was bogus. Where were you Mr. Levitt and your predecessor Mr. Waldman during Clinton's reign of terror? Playing golf? Giving lectures?What nerve. Millions of small investors got hosed on your watch and you have the nerve to publish this drivel. Nothing changes on Wall Street. Always a scam going to screw the little guy.
1,You Must Be Kidding,"This is a shallow work that is no way a help to investors. It should have never been placed into print. I lost thousands of dollars in the market and if the author had told investors this information while he was in office I, along with many others, would have been saved."
1,not what I expected,"I thought this case was going to be made specifically for a Nokia 3650 phone with a clear opening to see the screen and have a little hole for the camera to shoot pictures. This case is nothing of the sort, you cannot operate the phone until you remove it from the case."
1,Dissappointed customer,"I was so excited when I received my package,to my disappointment it was not even close to what I imagine.like your other customer from newark, I thought this case will have a clear opening to see the screen and have a little hole for the camera lens.I'am a very busy Mom with five children.I dont think I would even have time to remove my cell phone from the case to make a call."
1,pathetic,Worthless... totally agree with other 1 star reviews. Anyone know where to get one that allows you to use the phone WHILE it is in the case? Amazon shouln't even carry this piece of junk.
4,Amadeus Goes Rock,"Clayson, stuck in lo-fi obscurity, plays Salieri to Winwood's Mozart, asking why Steve has all the talent, money, and girls. More funny than bitter, Clayson's experience as a rock musician informs his understanding of the music industry and Winwood's remarkable career. In this sense the book is almost as much about the British pop music industry in the 1960s as Winwood per se. Definitely a cut above the usual pop star hagiography, despite lack of access to its subject (Winwood did not cooperate in the production of this book), a surprisingly good book."
5,Quiet Reigns,"Quiet, quiet, quiet! Just what I wanted. Reminding me of a very large wristwatch, this clock keeps time perfectly,looks good on my wall and runs quietly. It replaced one that could be heard throughout the house and kept us awake at night. Love it."
4,excellent beginner book to cichlids,"easy to read, excellent introduction to these type of fish, covers the basics of cichild keeping, excellent photographs, touches all aspects of being a cichlid aquarist.....the downside is that each section is very brief, if you desire a more in depth discussion on certain topics you will need to find another book to go along with this one, the other downside is that explanation of different kinds of cichlids is very general and brief...overall, a good beginner book, but much to general for the experiences aquarist"
4,Dr. Scholl's Footspa,I have used this spa twice so far and I am very happy with it. It is really a great product except the footrest which is little difficult to adjust. It did everything that's mentioned in the product description and came with a bonus Nail clipper too. I would highly recommend it.
3,"DVD ""Laura""","Execellent movie which I ordered to play on my Mac Desktop computer. Unfortunately, it won't play on my Mac. I have decided to keep it as it will play on the TV. I have had the ""Laura"" DVD from our library (as well as other movies) which will play on my Mac, so have no idea why some of the Amazon DVD's will not play on the computer even though all are designated for Region 1.The same is true for the movie, ""Rose Red,"" (Stephen King). It will play on the TV, but not on the Mac.Of these three that I ordered, ""Innocents Lost"" (Jesse Stone) is the only one that will play on my Mac...I am curious about the quality of the DVD's and why some work on the computer and some don't."
4,Great Film Noir,"Although I prefer a deadlier femme fatale, it was a great film! I wrote my final Film Noir paper on it."
5,Great old movie,"Yes, it's a formula who-dun-it. But it's fun seeing Vincent Price before the mustache and pointed hat, and I'd forgotten what a beautiful woman Gene Tierney was. The accents are half the fun...And the music is great..."
5,Brilliant mystery.,"Superb version of Vera Caspary's great novel. Clifton Webb is unforgettable. Gene Tierney, Dana, Andrews, Judith Anderson,, and Vincent Price are excellent. Classic with a surprise ending."
5,Justifiably a classic.,"Laura is a classic example of film noir at its best. But it's also an outstanding film from the Golden Age of movies without regard to genre. The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns, and the cast -- including, Gene Tierney as Laura, Dana Andrews as the detective assigned to investigate her alleged murder, and Clifton Webb as her arrogant admirer -- play their parts well. I can't imagine how any true movie fan could not like this classic film -- even if you generally don't like film noir. And, once heard, can the song ""Laura"" ever be forgotten? Please don't miss this one."
5,DVD,This is a movie I can watch over and over again. I have watched it two times since receiving it.Chas E. Moser
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though the murder mystery aspects of Laura don't work at all (I love when the cop finds a gun and then leaves it at the scene...just 'cause), the cast of characters (led by a wonderful Clifton Webb) are so interesting that Laura is worth recommending despite its flaws."
5,Best of the Film Noir era,"Laura is a well paced, smart movie full of drama, glamour and humour. Gene is stunning as the victim. Dana Andrews is sexy as the detective that falls in love with the muder victim through stories he hears from her friends, family and the man she was going to marry. It has a nice twist and keeps you guessing who did it. Vincent Price is interesting in a rare role that wasn't a horror film. Clifton Webb has a lot of the best lines as a cruel self obessed writer. This is a personal fave and i recommend it to anyone with taste."
4,Old Movies,Great film noir with Gene Tierney and a fantastic score -- theme song is one of my favorite oldies...
4,Where's Waldo?,"Classic movie. Great acting, direction and writing. If you like noir movies, than you'll love ""Laura."" If you have no idea what ""noir"" is, watch this movie anyway."
5,Outstanding film,This was my late father's absolute favorite film. It is most definitely Gene Tierney's best role. The use of flashback was new at the time and tells the story well. I recommend it highly.
5,Haunting,Black and white masterpiece of a film. Gene is at her most innocent and portrays her part so well as the alluring and naive woman. Dana fits the role like a glove as the detective intrigued by the victim in this case. Riveting a must for all fans of this genre.
