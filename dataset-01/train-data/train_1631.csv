4,Ask your library to get one,"This is a very nice collection of articles dealing with Hobbes's relationship to the law- the articles deal with Hobbes's legal theory and also with his contribution to particular areas in the law- contracts, punishment, international law, etc. Almost all of the articles are excellent (especially those by Gauthier, Murphy, and May) and the introduction by Finkelstein also is excellent at setting up the pieces and the project. I give the volume four stars instead of five since 1) the articles are all perviously published- while it's very nice and useful to have the together, one could have found them before. 2) As w/ all books in this series, the production values are not great and the price is outragous. But, since the book is likely to be useful for philosphers, political theoriest, and legal theoriest, all serious university libraries and law libraries ought to get a copy."
3,Very biased (but funny) collection of -ism words,"A long encyclopedia of the words that end in -ism. Covering many of the most pivotal concepts in political and economic thought, this is a comprehensive study. Infuriatingly biased at times and containing some inaccuracies, it is at other times hilariously funny and always thought-provoking."
3,Not as pictured,"The lens cap fits well for my Nikon D60, but it is not the same one that is pictured and does not have the loop. I was hoping to find a lens cap that I could attach with a cord, as I have accidentally knocked the cap off and want to make sure I don't lose it."
5,Excellent Pictorial Account,"Having just visited Auschwitz last week, I ordered this book as a remembrance of my experience there. The pictures and the stories behind the way they were obtained are extremely compelling and accurately show the accounts of the people who perished there."
4,"Good size, Text a bit small","While it calls itself a pocket Bible, I doubt you'll actually manage to fit it in your pocket. But it is small enough to easily carry around.The text font within is readable but a bit smaller than I'd like. I suppose small font is to be expected to some degree with a pocket Bible, though."
3,"Pocket-sized, really small, light print","I have several compact Bibles. This is smaller than most, actually fitting into a man's pants pocket, with only one edge sticking out. Most compact Bibles I've seen are not this small. Compared to other compact Bibles I've had, the print is particularly small to the point I think I will have to hold it rather close to my face. The print is also light--more of a dark gray than black, which also makes it harder to read. I do like the TNIV version of the Bible. It is a very simple, easy to understand version in today's American language. If you want a really small Bible, this is a good bet. Slightly larger Bibles may make it easier to read."
4,letters are too small,i like the cover design but the letters are too small and they are too thin. i wish they are bit darker. other than that i love this bible for the price.
5,It grows on you,"At first spin, I thought, hmm, same old, same old. Listened a couple more times and it's like it isn't even the same CD. It's AWESOME! Is this the reason why his music never ever gets any airplay...at first listen it doesn't grab you... so in this short attention span world there isn't a deejay that would give them a second spin? Is it the subject matter? His voice? What is it?? Why can't he break through? Can anyone answer that one? It's such a pity, the songs are incredibly complex and rewarding. The dude is a flat out genius."
4,Raw but great,"You listen to this album and you are reminded of what an incredible songwriter Westerberg is. These are all part of the Westerberg/ Mats formula so you feel like you have heard them all before, but in a good way. Paul recorded this in his basement so the some songs have that unfinished feel to them. They have great hooks but a few songs he can't seem to figure out how to end. That's okay because the songs are so good you don't want them to. The album is a little raw but that's Paul for you."
4,Just bought both new Westerberg cds,"O.K., I own or have heard everything by the Replacements and Paul Westerberg and have not liked only a couple of things... cds that I thought were a little over-produced and sterile. Not a problem with this cd.I bought Paul's new cd and, yes, it is in a way like Stereo/Mono, sharing a couple of melodies, but who cares? I loved both Stereo and Mono and don't think that's a major criticism.I think with Westerberg, your only big worry should be if the cd is overproduced. This is rough and great."
2,Hit and Miss,"Seems that Paul Westerberg needs about 3 years between releases to recharge his battery and have something focused to say. This one, unfortunately, is too soon for that to happen. It rambles and meanders through its 13 tracks. I like most people feel that Westerberg is not at his best when over produced, however there's difference between that and not produced (just another word for edited, really) at all. This suffers from self-indulgence and lack of artistic objectivity. Stereo/Mono was about a artist finding himself, this seems more about a artist playing with himself. I recommend everyone wait for the next release, by then enough time will have passed for another incredible release from Paul Westerberg."
1,Booorrringg!!! I want my money back!,"I bought this book hoping to learn how to use self hypnosis, and how to do it myself. Instead, I spent reading chapter after chapter of stories that just repeat themselves on how others found self hypnosis to be very helpful. Well, duhhh, if I didn't know that already I wouldn't have bought the book! It's a waste of time and money. If you're looking for a practical guide on how to use self hypnosis, this is not it. If you just need something to help you fall asleep, well, stick with it - It would do the trick! Can I have my money back?"
3,Meh,"The book was alright, it wasn't great, it wasn't good just alright. The book doesn't seem to be written by the same author that wrote Magician Apprentice/Master (in fact it doesn't seem to be written by the same author that wrote any of the previous books). I felt this was made to be like a cheesy movie (How one character point of view would transition into another with them repeating the same sentence). No character development, no excitement, no climax, and the most important no characters I actually like. I believe Pug should NOT be a main character anymore, his time is over. I would like Feist to focus more on his sons or another character that doesn't seem to be all powerful, they should have some flaws that can be seen. I believe Feist read books that have multiple characters and wanted to duplicate this, he failed. Focus on a group of characters instead of bouncing around without any sense of time."
1,Lackluster effort,"I must preface this review by stating that I considered Mr. Feist at one time to be one of the best in his genre. However, I have noticed in recent years that that the quality of his storytelling has deteriorated. I am convinced that his latest efforts have been driven solely by financial motivation (shocking!). He is living off the reputation that he gained in earlier trilogies.Frankly, having just read Into a dark Realm, I can recall nothing worth recommending in this novel. Save your money and time and bypass this one...its too bad."
4,Avid fantasy reader,I love every book that raymond feist writes. I only take issue with the fact that he keeps them short. 400 pages doesn't last me very long and I'm sure that doesn't only go for me. Otherwise he creates a new world for us to live in with this book. He delves into the darker part of the human condition and forces us to look into ourselves a little bit deeper. Definately recommended and theres a great surprize at the end!
5,good book,"Love Raymond Feist's books including this one. His earlier books were the best, they drew me into the story as if I was a part of it. I find myself feeling as if I know the characters personally and that causes me to want to continue reading his books to find out how it all ends."
5,The Ultimate in Tea,"I can't put into words how delicious this tea is. If there is a perfect tea taste, it would have to be silver needle.It is very pricey, but after trying it in the white sampler from adagio, I decided it was well worth to keep around. Mixes great with all kinds of herbals, and makes great night-time blends.This is a great purchase for any tea lover!As always, Adagio devlivers an amazing procuct."
1,Exploitation of a star for a quick buck,"I wanted to read a biography on one of my favorite singers that will give a realistic, yet, smart look on her life. Good Girl, Bad Girl is nothing but a piece of trash written by a man who either wanted to get back on Whitney for something, or was looking to make a quick buck at her expense. I am aware that celebrity lives behind the spotlight might not be wonderful---but I still feel that they are entitled to their privacy. I am so glad I didn't buy this book, I returned it to my friend the very next day, I didn't bother to finish it."
1,The Greatest Disappointment of All,"Oh please, read the book, wasn't thrilled. It had it's amusing points, but I think that Mr. Ammons has a vendetta against Whitney and this is the payback. I am no where near a Whitney houston fan and I read this with the intention of having more fuel to add to my fire- but this was no kerosene. I often got the impression that though this was supposed to be a ""tell-all"", Mr. Ammons was reluctant to diverge a lot of information he could have told. Maybe he's saving that for a follow-up, who knows? who cares? This book is best left in the store."
1,"If I could give ZERO stars, I would.","This author clearly used Whitney's name and his brief time with her to try to sell a book about himself. This book was 90% of the author's biography and 10% about Whitney. I got this book as a gift - thank goodness I didn't spend my own money on this - well, crap."
2,What a joke?,"Sounds to me like Kevin wrote this book to make a quick buck and to get back at Regina. And Kevin was just as scanless as Regina he had a wife and children, however, was having an affair with Regina because of the promise of a record deal. Most of the things that were written about Whitney was not original. I could have wrote this book myself based on gathering information from previous articles written on Whitney. He should have wrote a novel about him and Regina and their scanless ways. I am glad that I waited for this book to come out in paper."
5,This book is very good,When I heard of the book by Whitney Houston I went right out and bought it . I really like it. She is one of my favorite singer and astress
1,More garbage from Phillips,"If you have already read Profits and Politics or The Cousins Wars or Arrogant Capital, you should have gotten your fill of this Nixon-ite.The fact that his books only have a higher than deserved rating at Amazon and don't sell that well in the book stores should tell you what kind of an audience this guy has.If you must read it, check it out at your library (if they have it)or buy a used copy for a buck."
3,Difficult Reading - Lots of facts:,"I found the book eye opening and quite interesting. I wish the book was easier to read for John Q Public. It is my belief that if Kevin would be able to make the facts come alive and understandable to John Q, it would be a best seller.............."
1,Makes for a great novel,"Funny, this book is listed as nonfiction. In fact, it should be classified as fiction. The fact that I fond a copy in the fiction dept indicates to me that somebody is trying to get a message out.Will anybody ever tell the truth?"
1,Amusing economic fiction,"The reviewer who wrote; ""Facts but no anlsysis"" was close, but not that close. The truthof the matter is that there is neither facts nor analsysis with this book by Phillips.Thank God for amazons return policy."
2,not all i'd hoped...,"After reading both ""Nickel and Dimed"" and a wonderful novel called ""Only in America"" -- both of which dealt with income disparities and unemployment, I was ready to tackle this one, also recommended to me by a friend. Still I found the premise, that it's basically all the government's doing, a little tough to take. What about those entrepreneurs who succeed on their own, make it big, and yes, far outpace the average income in the U.S.? Is the gulf between rich and poor any wider now than, say, between Andrew Carnegie and the immigrant mill or factory worker? There's no doubt the rich enjoy special privilege, but it seems a bit simplistic to say that's the entire reason for inequality."
1,Interesting opinion - but not based on any facts,Phillips does know something about marketing. Write a book attacking the rich and appeal to the 95% who are in the low to middle and class and don't re alize that what little they do have is because of the rich who provide them with J-O-B's. These poor souls will spend grocery money to buy this junk and they encourage their broke friends to do the same.Remember Phillips was closely associated with Nixon. If this is who you want to take your advice from....then God help you!
3,Premise of author is correct,Not much that I can add that other reviewers haven't already stated.The fact is that most of the wealth in America is controlled by only 2% of the population and the rest of us are dancing to it.It's time for Americans to get mad and do something about it. This book is a real eye opener.
3,Don't attack W&D untill you have read it.,"1 star reviewers, at least do Mr. Phllips the dignity of reading the book before you bash it. Keep in mind that Phillips is a republican and as an American, has the virtue of freedom of speech. Read the book and then come back and state your ""opinions.""Or----are your minds so frozen that you cannot accept any other viewpoints than whay you percieve to be true?Read it first!"
1,Reverse psychology only works on Democrats,"First of all, isn't it all so obvious that the 5 star reviews are all from the same person-DUH!The way that guy reviews this tome, you would swear he is reviewing War and Peace or some really outstandingwork.And notice how anytime someone tells the facts about Al Gore, how he (Gore) tried to steal that last election or Mr. Zipper and the ""The Worst Family"", that those reviews are inundated with unhelpful votes? Hello?This book is boring at best and very misleading. The Rich get richer? This is a very old and stale excuse for the ineptitude of the last Presidential administration. Put this book on your ""must miss"" list."
3,Who's been victimizing whom,"This book has two main themes:1) The very rich victimize the rest of us. They are presently forcing us onto a shorter and shorter end of the stick.2) The U.S. is well into its hour, as a super power, of strutting across the world. Our script parallels earlier ones acted out by Spain, Holland, and then England.The author spends 422 pages spelling out how the little guy has been and is being victimized, often with the collusion of government. His presentation glosses over how some victims have contributed to their fate. He doesn't, for example, point out that our pre-revolutionary tobacco farmers were deeply in debt to English buyers partly because they lived higher on the hog than their situation warranted -- a lot like present day victims of credit card debt.The book didn't pull me along, so I had to push myself to wade through it. If you have a greater interest in this subject you may, however, appreciate its wide-ranging coverage."
1,U.S. Constitution says,"That everyone has equality of opportunity. BUT no one guarantees equality of results.Only in America can anyone reach their dreams by persistence.Equality of results is only available in communist and socialist countries. Consequently, nobody has anything.Books like Wealth and Democracy is a somewhat biased book/"
1,Biased and misleading,"Phillips is still on his post Reagonomics jibberish.The way Phillips tells it, success in America is rigged and the average (middle class) don't have a chance. Bull!Tell that to the Michael Jordans, and the Ophrah Winfreys who came from poor even suffered abuse during their childhoods.We're all not lucky enought to be born in the Kennedy clan or the descendant of a Rockafellar, but we all can succeed in AAmerica and without political interference,thank you,If Phillips wants to get on somebodies case, why not go after allof those analysts that gave ridiculous upgrades to stocks like Enron, Worlcom, Lucent and Compaq, knowing full well that these companies were undeserving of such bullishness."
1,Read Millionaire Next Door or Rich Dad instead....,"That is if you are interested in wealth.The Millionaire Next Door by Drs Stanley and Danko gives an excellent account on how the wealthy really became wealthy in this country (documented date and had nothing to do with Democracy or politics)Wealth and Democracy will appeal to some, albeit those who will never attain any real level of wealth.Rich Dad Poor Dad although different from Millionaire Next Door also deals with how to attain wealth.No doubt the 5 star reviewers for Wealth & Democracy will not find Millionaire Next Door or Rich Dad Poor Dad appealing and would prefer to blame the government for your lack of success.It's all up to you.If you like to read about economics, I recommend Wealth & Democracy, just don't take it too seriously. Then perform an exorcism and read something with value like The Millionaire Next Door, The Millionaire Mind or Rich Dad Poor Dad."
1,A different response to Jessica G.,"All I can say is BRAVO! It's about time somebody gets the guts to tell it like it is.Something has smelled about this book since the getgo. And you Jessica G. brought that smell out.So many people are excuse makers and looking for a free handout. America is indeed the ""land of opportunity"" for those perceptive enough to see it. The only thing that I would add to your excellent review is that it is long past time to revamp the social security system. In it's present form it is an antiquated system at best that won't be around or won't be enough. It definitely needs to be privatized as other countries have done. Phillips does touch on the social security issue, but not with the right authority or conviction. Now here is an area that I think Phillips should go after, if in fact he is genuinely concerned about Wealth & Equality."
1,Makes a good doorstop,"If you really want this book, check your local used book stores. I found a copy of W&D for a $1. Did I buy it? No, still overpriced in my book.Besides, this book is mistitled. Nothing about wealth in here. If you are frustrated and looking for an excuse to rationalize your problems, then this book is probably for you. If you are looking for any real solutions, forget it---buy another book."
1,Booooring - zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This ""book"" bu Phillips is nothing but a rehash of all the misconceptions on how to build wealth. The same people who support this book probably watch reruns of DALLAS & DYNASTY and then go out any buy lotterytickets looking for a wealth without work existance.1 star only because pages are numberedcorrectly."
3,The minds of the very wealthy,"Actually I've read just over half of this text; and so I'll give a 3 rating out of neutrality. I hold no particular brief for or against the book's position. As a Libertarian, MBA Finance, CPA and senior financial manager, I can say it describes very well the attitudes and behavior of people you probably will never meet. I have. You cannot conceive of the ways ego and power are wielded.This book accurately describes the behavior of that group. Don't dismiss it simply because you cannot believe it."
3,"Power, Wealth, Politics and Democracy","The author does have a point. The fact that Al Gore used power, wealth, politics and the media to transcend democracy and nearly stole the last Presidential election shows how serious this issue really is.Time to put the wealthy, greedy and egotistical braggards in their place. I completely agree with Phillips in this area."
1,Bad Economics,"If you are going to write about business and the wealthy it helps to know basic economics. Mr. Phillips is unburdened by any real economics knowledge and it shows. This book is trite, tired and erroneous. There is a book waiting to be written by a Marxist or Keynesian about the intersection of wealth and power in American political history, but this isn't it."
1,He's got it WRONG!,"Books like this always come out during troubled times like we are experiencing right now. Authors like Kevin Phillips prey on the weak and naive who are scared about the future.For more politically accurate books, read ""At Any Cost: How Al Gore tried to steal the Election"", Bias, or Slander.America is a great country, the greatest in the free world. It will turn around.Consider this: It took Ronald Reagan two full terms and George Bush, Sr. 1 full term to correct the mistakes made by their predecessors. So it stands to reason that it will take some time for GWB II to correct the mistakes of his predecessor.We finally have a real president in office and a powerful administration.You don't build up the weak by tearing down the strong. You don't create wealth in the poor by attacking the rich.In closing, I can sum up this book in three words:WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,I'd rather put money in my savings than send it to Wash. DC,"As Bob Dole so adequately mentioned in his debate with former President Clinton regarding taxes; ""I'd rather put money in my savings than send it off to Washington, DC [in the form of taxes]A congressman once said that ""taxes are a levy on ignorance"".Higher taxes also puts a strain on our employers. That is more money that can go to us.Besides the tax issue, I strongly dissagree with Phillips personal opinion and take issue with who is really writing these ""5 star"" reviews.Check your wallet before giving Phllips book anything above 2 stars."
2,Mistitled book - nothing about wealth in here,"If you are looking for a book about building or maintaining wealth, keep looking. This book should have been called ""My View on Politics"" or ""Fear and Ignorance"". Only those who are really afraid and totally ignorant will buy or read this worthless tome."
2,Definitely a s-l-o-w read zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I couldn't understand why his was such a slow read. I thought maybe because Phillips was superintelligent or something. But after closer inspection, that is certaintly not the case. Phillips is not super intelligent at all.Then it hit me. Everything Phillips wrote (and continues to write) did not and does not correlate to the facts. That is why it was such a slow read. My subconscious mind was trying to tell me that this book was all bull s_ _ _t only because it is all bull s_ _ _t.Take a look at the job numbers that came out today. If you have been reading Phillips, this should not have been possible. Take alook at how the stock market has been exploding for the last year and a half. Then take a look at how the stock market was doing during the Nixon years. H-E-L-L-O.This book should not be listed as non fiction. It is pure b.s."
1,Why is this book still around?,"Phillips books typically make it to the discount racks before they make it to the normal retailers like BAMM, WALDENS, BJ DALTON, BORDERS etc. To wit, I checked our local book store to ""browse"" American Dynasty only to find they didn't carry it. Nor do they carry Wealth & Democracy, although I did find a copy of W&D at a used book store for about $1. Didn't buy it. Wasn't even worth a buck.Besides, I have very little respect for a man who helped get Nixon elected."
1,Pure Garbage!,"If you have a fire place, this book would make great firewood.Keep in mind, this is the guy that helped get Nixon elected.Need I say more?"
1,Nixon taught this man well,"Pillips prior association with Richard Nixon shines in this book.Not since the days of Nixon have I heard so much bull from one source.This book contrary to that one 5 star reviewer, is not very well researched.This book is biased and the conclusions are ridiculous.Save your money and buy a different book."
2,i still cant speak spanish,"it is a smart system that is very helpful, but my eyes strain to read the print. also if your like me you want to be able to carry on conversations in spanish, granted i still have 2 cds left to finish out of the 13, but the fluency isnt there. i read one review after i bought it that seems true saying - theyre biggest sin is they dont tell you the final 2 volumes are not for sale. in other words i cant go any further with this system, and now have to try to start a new one to obtain my spanish goals. in some cases the grammar gets tricky and they say dont worry about that, we'll cover it in level 3, but show me where on the internet or anywhere for that matter to buy level 3 or 4. you cant its impossible. give them credit im smarter than before though."
2,Not Quite Satisfied,"I ordered this book online.When I received it and started to examine the book I had to get some magnifying glasses to see the words. I was disappointed that the words were not the same size (large) as my classmates book. Also, I found out that I needed to order Level 1 of this Spanish book. I really would like to return the book and get the Level 1 that I am using for my class, if that is possible. I would not have ordered this book had I known that the words were so small. If you can help me I really would appreciate. I paid at least $54.00 for this book with CDs. Thank you.Ms. Williams"
4,Jeff Lorber's He Had a Hat,Jeff shows his many different styles of music which makes this album a treat to hear. I would highly recommend this to any smooth jazz afficienado.
3,Left Coast cool...or Left Coast drool?,"Ah, L.A. The sun, the PCH, the beach, the smog, the gridlock. There is something about So. Cali just mellows out jazz musicians. And JL is no exception. Still, its nice he's stepping outside of his smooth jazz nonsense and playing up to his potential. But not too much though. The bebop and Brazilian offering are pretty much filler. But I hear traces of the old JL Fusion sound in cuts like the title track, Orchid, and Hudson. The layered piano/flute lines are classic Lorber. But depending on what side of the jazz pendulum you lean, you may or may not like 'He had a Hat'. I see it as JL attempting a step in the right direction...that is, playing and writing at a level commensurate with his formidable chops. If only he can keep it up and not fall into another smooth jazz DULL-DRUM, he may finally take his rightful place with other progressive jazz keyboardists such as Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Dave Grusin, George Duke, and Bob James."
2,Wrong hat.,"I am an absolute JL fan, but this cd was a great disappointment to me.The reason is this: Mr. Lorber should have decided which hat he had on before he put the cd together. In my opinion the music is too versatile, and that makes it point in all directions musicstylewise. I like a cd to be within the same style. That is not the case here, I think. The playing is first class, of course, I just don't think the songs go that well together. It is like a poem where the verses are taken from different poems. The writer - here pianoplayer - is the same, but the verses do not necessarily go that well together. Best wishes Sigbjrn Reime, Norway"
2,Jeff Lorber,Being a fan for years I was disappointed in this CD. It was a departure from what he normally does and I did not like the direction.
4,Very good.......but!!,"I had anticipated this CD quite a lot after I'd seen it in the past....and then it won a Grammy Award.....that was it for me:ordered it up.....very good CD...with lots of creativity.....however.....two tracks on this CD defy definition.......both, the vocals....the second one is, sort of, OK....but the first !!......""Grandma's Hands""....it defies description as to WHY it was INSERTED --- into the genre of this CD !!!!....its like inserting a Donna Summer song into a Beethoven CD....completely IN ---congruous, y'all !!.....why the producers of not only this CD but a lot of others...want to spoil a pristine CD with some track that does not even come close to the ambience of the whole scene is beyond me.......to combat this, as I could not stand to listen to that track....which was like, #3 or thereabouts......I cassetted it.....and deleted both songs.....so now when I play, they are gone, baby !!....it's such a doggone shame and a wonder!!"
5,KodiakJack,"I received this as a Christmas present and I was extremely happy! The construction is top-notch and for trekking around the woods hunting and fishing this is the best compass I have ever owned --- I am military so I know my way around a lensatic compass and have had various hiking compasses - to include Suunto Suunto MC-2G Global Compass - and while this is a compass it is very reliable inthe field. Using the eye piece is simple and shooting an azimuth is a breeze. While some may comment that it is a bit pricey for a compass, I argue that you cannot put a price on reliability, precision, and construct when you are in the wilderness. A must for an outdoorsman of any pedigree."
2,It may get you lost,"This compass failed me. Luckily our small group each had a compass and after a lengthly comparison it was determined that MY SUUNTO was in error by over 30 degrees. Same thing happened to my brother's Suunto (both a KB-14)a year or so later. He had Suunto repair it at the cost of around 90 percent of a new one. The conpany representative said the vernier is glued on the compass plate and sometimes the glue fails and the vernier slips.They should have been happy to replace it for free AND fix the faulty design. So, if you are in the bush with this compass, better take 2 more to keep from getting lost.PS... I never had mine repaired and yes it is still over 30 degrees off."
5,The Mountain King Rocks,"Jon Oliva's Pain rocks every bit as hard as old Savatage ever did, and is the next best thing to a new savatage album that you can buy. If you like Savatage buy this album!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Jon O's Pain,"I still prefer Savatage, but Jon Oliva's Pain is very good, too. This CD is better than Tage Mahal, though."
4,Solid release,"You know what you're going to get from Jon - great songwriting and some killer metal. I prefer their 'Tage Mahal' cd over this one based solely on the songwriting not being *AS* memorable, but it is still a good release. It was money well-spent."
2,A blatant case of false advertising,"This is a blatant case of false advertising. The cover of the unrated bonus edition, and the image Amazon.com uses, shows a photo of Tania Raymondo topless, but does she appear topless in the movie? No! Not in the unrated bonus edition. Neither does Vanessa Lengies. The producers of this movie are trying to exploit the public's interest in characters like Nadia in ""American Pie"" and Areola in ""Not Another Teen Movie"", but unlike those fine films the foreign exchange students in ""Foreign Exchange"" stay completely buttoned up. The plot was lousy too."
4,it was somewhat entertaining,This movie appeals to the partying high school teenage guy. Lots of drinking and lots of smoking and of course a couple topless girls and you have an entertaining movie.
4,Takes longer then 10 but great,This is an excellent reference and quit source for anyone trying to get the feel for SQL programming. Simple enough for a novice user and techical enough to more seasoned. I would recommend it to anyone using databases.
5,Best SQL Book/Reference,"Ben Forta does a superb job with this SQL book. It is a small book (a bit over 200 pages) but is packed with well explanined SQL concepts and commands. I am in a database class right now and we are learning SQL. This book is easily filling in all the blanks and is a great reference because of it. The explanations are very lean, but thorough. I will be looking at Mr. Forta's other books as I can see how good of an author he is.Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes (3rd Edition)"
5,Excellent Place To Start,I purchased this book to supplement my dbase course. I have never used SQL and thought I would benefit by having an extra book to reference. I highly recommend this book to anyone just getting started with SQL. The author starts with basic statements and builds on them making it easy to understand from the very beginning.
5,"Well written, fun, and straight forward","I bought this book to learn SQL for advancement at work. Once I downloaded the database tables from the author's website, the chapters are very easy to follow along with. The chapters really do take 10 minutes. I do a couple a day. I find this way of learning doesn't overpower the brain. Great book!"
5,Nice Book,"Fairly basic, but then I'd forgotten all my SQL stuff from 8 years ago.His website was simple and easy to get the samples and error notes.I enjoyed using the book."
4,Sams Teach Yourself SQL in One Hour a Day,Lessons are clear and concise. The text makes learning easy and quick for the experienced IT professional. On-line scripts to create example tables and subsequent example data are helpful. I would not recommend for the inexperienced IT professional on Oracle due to numerous errors in the Oracle specific workbook examples and example scripts for populating data from supplied SQL scripts. The various errors are almost comical. Note that correcting these errors has in fact been a pleasure for me in that correcting such has in fact sped my learning process of this 4GL language.
5,Excellent,a very good book for begginers in SQL; it explains main concepts with a lot of helpful examples
5,Written for people who don't know SQL,"The book is short and that is a strength. If you are trying to learn SQL for the first time, I would recommend this book. However, if you already can do basic select statements and joins, then find another book to advance your skills. One thing to keep in mind is that this book will just teach you the basics. If you need to use SQL to get data for your job and you are not trying to become an expert, I would start and end with this book alone."
4,A pretty good superhero tie-in,"The author gives some surprisingly good characterization not just to the heroes, but to the villains and supporting characters (especially Namor's scheming cousin Byrrah and his co-conspirator Tydeus, who come across as quite three-dimensional). There's a few errors in continuity with the original comic books (the author gets the name of Namor's grandfather wrong; implies that Namor never met his father when, in fact, he did; and Vashti is claimed to be Grand Vizier since before Namor's time, when in fact it was Namor who made him the Grand Vizier, elevating him from the peasantry). But if you can get over that, this makes for a quick, pleasant read."
3,Holds the tent down,"These have done a great job of holding the tent down, even in some pretty windy situations. They really do not feel like they will last though."
4,William Clinton Jr.,this dvd was very helpful in the skinning and fleshing of many different types of furbearers.The only thing that was missing was the finer point of really cleaning the fur up for marketing and the proper way of sewing up damaged fur.Other than these points the dvd was very good
3,Fair selection of animal types,No rabbits or squirrels in this one.I would have given 5 stars for at least one way to skin a cat.
4,Cosmetic,"These plugs push into and cover the screw heads of Blum screw in leveling legs. If you prefer a white plastic domed plug over a metal screw head, they will serve you well. It certainly is a tidy finish. But you still have a bump in the floor of the cabinet. If you don't want that, you could use the push in leveling feet instead, then you have a 30 mm hole to contend with, and no plugs available for those - one wonders why they don't make an equivalent for those feet (that you would probably install on the back side of the cabinets so that you can adjust them from inside instead of underneath)."
1,Avoid this product,"1. Does not fit standard bulb receptacle, nor the opening in the taillight assembly. Had to drill out my taillight to fit, and tape it into the bulb receptacle.2. So low in decibels, could *barely* hear it outside the car, standing 1 foot away from backup light.3. Vastly overpriced - suggest you consider the WOLO backup alarm available at Kragen, AutoZone, or online at Amazon. Wolo = $11.00, this product = $25+"
2,Be careful,"The Editorial Review posted for this item is for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT work. So go by the title, NOT the description.I was disappointed that none of the original artwork from the original was included. But that omission is not stated in the description.Other than that, it is an interesting example of a historical review of human structure and function. As a historical document, it is not up-to-date scientifically."
4,Unforgettable,Who could not love Miranda and Prospero? And the Signet Classics have great notes and commentary. Now to see the movie...
3,sorta the best guitar ever,"this guitars pretty good except that when i got it a dot on the fingerboard came off on my hand. Then i was playing it and the middle pickup fell off. I put a humbucker there instead. Then the jack on the guitar was messed up so i had to solder the wires. So all in all this guitar plays pretty good, but i dnt recommend getting this guitar if u dunt kno how to fix pickups or put new ones on or kno sum technical stuff about guitars. Look on [...] or go to ur nearest gibson or fender dealer if u dnt want the hassle, but this is a pretty good price fr a guitar like this dnt get me wrong."
2,Terrible company - subpar product,"The good: The guitar looks pretty. Like most, I didn't get the exact color pictured, but I liked it anyway.The bad: Just after 30 days of ownership (conveniently after the return period), a crack developed in the neck.The worst: Austin Bazaar is a company that should just plain be put out of business for their poor customer service. When I contacted them to ask about replacement, they referred to the ""no returns after 30 days"" policy. When I repeatedly tried to email for support on how to go about getting the guitar fixed or asked if it was a normal occurence, my emails went ignored. I tried the customer service phone number and was referred straight to email, couldn't even speak to a human. Way to stand by your product!If you want an inexpensive instrument, I'd recommend buying a quality used instrument. AVOID AUSTIN BAZAAR!"
4,well ok i guess,ok i got this one for my friend and the amp didnt work.... so we told the pppl and they sent a new amp.. broken!!!!!!!! i have the Behringer V-tone Electric Guitar Kit and its PERFECT. you may need a new set of strings but its still good! ive had it for 2 years!!!!! worked fine and this didnt work so he got the Behringer V-tone Electric Guitar Kit and now we jam in our band Styx N Stones
3,NICE LOOK,"MY SON LOVES THE GUITAR BUT, HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY YET BECAUSE EVERYTIME YOU TRY AND TUNE IT, THE STRINGS BREAK, LIKE THE KNOBS ARE SHARP AND ARE CUTTING THE STRING. CAN U ADVISE ME WHAT TO DO?"
2,Not a Good Guitar,"I got this guitar and it worked ok for about 3 months. After 3 months, it wouldn't work when I pluuged it into the amp. I thought that the amp was just broken until my cousin tried his guitar with it and it worked and sounded perfect. I was very dissapointed. Now I am buying a gibson epoch for less the money and it will be a better value I'm sure."
5,it's a water bottle. what more could you ask for?,Great deep purple color. Standard Nalgene bottle. Nothing suprising. Just bought for the color and it didn't disappoint. Cheaper to buy on Amazon than at the local sports store.
5,Red Hot Chili Peppers DVD Slaine Castle,Bought this dvd for my husband--He Absolutely loves it. It is a great concert from the past from the Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!! Love Them!!!!!!!!
5,live at slane review,"quite possibly the best concert ever put on by anyone. everyone should own this concert DVD. i watch this endlessly along with ""off the map"" and ""psychedelik sexfunk:live from heaven""RHCP ARE THE BEST."
5,awesome,it was a gift for my son and he loved it inmediatly was opened he star to watch this concert thanks...
5,Slane will Blow Your Mind,"I'll make this short. Quite simply, this DVD is absolutely breathtaking. I bought the Coldplay DVD last week, and it pales in comparison to this one. Slane boasts incredible effects (like a 360 degree circling view of Anthony while in midair), great camera angles, fades between the crowd and closeups of the guys, and other amazing things. The setlist for this show is incredible, the highlights being Under the Bridge and Venice Queen. This was the biggest crowd the Peppers ever played for (80,000) people, and there is nothing quite like seeing everyone chanting together with only Chad banging on his drums. In short, I assure you that you will get chills down your spine when you watch this. If you liked Coldplay's Live 2003, then you will like this even more! Enjoy."
5,Unbelievable,"I've seen everything from the awesome ""Pulse"" by Pink Floyd, The Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"", everything from the Stones including ""Four Flicks"", Eric Clapton's latest, and every other notable band that may come to mind..........But nothing comes close to this delight to the senses. The absolute best live concert DVD I have ever seen or heard. What an amazing performance! I hope they come to Australia soon."
1,Water Head Music,Not there best work! If you like to watch concerts that don't seem to make the grade then buy this one!
3,Bare bones DVD...,"Five stars for the energy of the show. Three things detract majorly from it, tho.1. No bonus content, no interviews, backstage segment, not even a bio.2. The ridiculous camera editing when Anthony is jumping.3. Not one track that is pre-Blood Sugar. They had FOUR albums before that (of you don't count 'The Abbey Road EP'), but not one track from the previous albums was included in their set list.I like the Chili Peppers, but their fans (new and old) deserve much more than a no-frills DVD which has the show just start playing, and them getting off the stage as soon as possible at the end, not to mention playing songs that were written after a lot of people say they 'sold out'. This one didn't stay in the collection long."
4,"Good, but not as good as Off the Map","Don't get me wrong, I think Live at Slane Castle is an incredible live DVD. It's just difficult for me, because the Red Hot Chili Peppers are on of my favorite bands... Unfortunately, this one pales in comparison, not due to the performance (which is excellent) but due to the song selection. The oldest songs they play (if you don't count a Ramones cover) are songs from ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik."" Where's ""Fire?"" Where's ""Me and My Friends?"" These and others are Chili Peppers classics, and should be included in place of mediocre at best current songs like ""Don't Forget Me,"" and ""Venice Queen."" The other strange thing about this DVD is the lack of upbeat songs. They opened with ""By the Way,"" for Christ's sake. I'll end this review by saying that despite the mediocre at best set list, the show is captivating, and incredibly well played. It's excellent by the standard of live DVD's in general, but not great by the standard of RHCP DVDs."
4,"Crap Camera work, but otherwise its good","I am not giving it 5 stars because I hate cameras that pan and scan, in and out, showing to much of the fans, on and on every song. and I hate stadium shows.However I LOVE the opening 2 min song, man what a geetar jam at the end! it all sorta blurs thru the start after that and into the middle of the show, then takes off, as per usual of all concerts. pretty hard to hit the ground running when you have to work out for almost 2 hours.when are people going to learn, film a show just showing the band for the most part, no in and out all over the place cameras, and a small place. THEN you can relase it on DVD. simple as that.A good example of concert producing and camera work is the Led Zeppelin DVD set released in 03 and pick and Austin City Limits concerts on PBS. why is this so complicated to learn? one would think a monkey could do this right."
5,Live at slane rocks!!!!!,"This dvd is awesome! you have to buy it! i have watched this atleast 5 times. it has mostly songs from californication and by the way, but they also play Give It Away, Under The Bridge, and The Power Of Equality.you should buy OFF THE MAP if you want earlier songs. johns solos are amazing and flea is the best bass player ever. chad is awesome on drums and anthony is a great singer(and dancer). this is a must have for any peppers fan. IT IS FLIPPIN SWEET!!!!!"
5,Great for 11-13-year-old girls,My daughter loves these books and has read nearly the entire series now. She easily relates to the heroine. She also has learned a lot from the situations Sophie finds herself in.
5,By any other name. . . .,"The most ""helpful"" thing I can say about ""Promethean Groove"" is that the man behind the work is Brian Transeau, aka ""BT."" Like so many electronic artists, BT has taken to recording works under more than one name, and Kaistar is one his aliases. ""Promethean Groove"" is an uptempo, trancey track that is well-produced and definitely high quality. Fans of Brian Transeau will definitely enjoy this one."
5,"10 years of failed attempts, this book did the trick","After 10 years of failed attempts at learning to swim, this book did the trick.Excellent step by step approach builds confidence and avoids the ""just do it"" leap that is so hard to make.Each step begins with the why and the what. These are followed by drills that gradually put all the parts together. The drills are very well thought out, you are learning all the time, and you never get pushed out to the ragged edge where it all falls apart.Thank you David Thomas!"
4,excelent teaching tool,"I have always had a fear of swimming but had learned elementary techniques to get used to the water and the feeling of submersion. However, I really did not know proper swimming techniques. This book has helped improve my swimming greatly-from freestyle to the breaststroke (there are other styles taught in the book, as well). My confidence level has increased dramatically."
3,"Sympathetic Christian Scholar doesn't quite ""get"" Magic","""in order to heal estrangement from Biblical religion""Well, No. Biblical religion has naught to do with our practice of Witchcraft, it is certainly not the goal of our religion as the above seesm to imply. This editorial review above does betray the author's bias; she is not a Pagan despite recieving initiation in Reclaiming tradition of Witchcraft. Ours is an ecstatic religious tradition of the immanent Goddess, fundamentally different from the Judaeo-Christian-Islamic religions, but also more ecstatic, activist, transfomational and less into polarity than Wicca. Her style is scholarly, yet her biases shape her research."
2,Caveat,"This guide would be useful to those who are contemplating a move FROM THE UK to France. There are innumerable and exclusive comparisons between the UK and French systems. Those moving from other European Union countries will also benefit. However, those contemplating a move from a non-EU country will find this book less relevant.The book provides a useful summary of public information about France, covering basic political and economic structures, residence and entry regulations, transportation, education, employment, and retirement."
1,key ring,"I was hopeful when I saw this product ""on line"". I ordered it, and the little ball that is used to screw on and close the horseshoe key ring, came off. I returned it, and the same thing happened. Don't waste your money."
2,flimsy crap,"Blame me for thinking this looked like something Thomas Crowne would have his keys on, I should have known you get what you pay for. Not solid at all it bean to tarnish after one week of use and the metal is very soft, it bends under the slightest of pressure and will never really retain the pictured design. After two weeks it was tossed in the trash, lesson learned."
3,"It's okay,,,","It is very nice, but the little ball screws off too easily. It kept coming off, kept coming off, until finally, we couldn't find it. It isn't the product - but the style that I have a problem with."
5,Fanastic book,The book came in excellent condition and it was a fanastic book. Thank you for selling it to me.
5,A Good Read,"This well-written book is very descriptive! From Port Arthur, Texas, to San Francisco's Haight / Ashbury, scenes of tragedy & revelry are given a jolt of life. Author really sought out the witnesses who are still around (and not too wasted) to tell the tales. Great book for fans of San Francisco, rock music, and of course Janis.Plenty of sleaze, drugs, and sex, but author nicely presents the tender-hearted girl that was Janis Joplin."
2,"Burns my underarms every time, takes forever to shave legs","I got this because the rotary razors have always seemed to me like they'd deliver a smoother shave (being multi-directional). However, after 2-3 months of using it, I've decided it's pretty much useless for me. The shave is not any smoother than a normal electric shaver. Also, I've never had razor burn from any razor before, but this one gives me nasty burns on my armpits every time I use it there.The real death knell for this shaver for me is that it takes many passes of it to shave my legs completely. My hair is fine, thin, and light colored, so I don't have to shave often, but when I do, I want it to go efficiently. The only pleasant part is that it feels a bit like a massager on my legs.Overall, I can't recommend this razor. It's possible that it just does better on a different hair type than mine, but if you have fine/soft leg hair, skip this razor."
3,it's just ok,"I bought this because of the Remington name and the price. It is good for around the legs, but it leaves a rash when doing other areas and does not do underarms."
2,Tears your skin up,"This is the worst electric razor I've ever bought. I don't have sensitive skin but it still nicks my skin. The directions tell you NOT to use it on your underarms. I now know why, it will kill you. I can't even shave my thighs with it without getting cuts. The only place I can use it is from my knees to my ankles. I definately would not recommend this razor."
1,Not for underarms?,I am hacked off. I just got mine in the mail and there in the directions it says legs only no underarms. What did you think I wanted this for? Just to use on my legs and then have another razor for the rest. NOT. I think you should say up front this is just for legs. I'm going to try it anyway but seeing these reviews makes me think I just wasted my money.
4,Unjustifiably expensive but effective,I had given this filter 1 star only for the price however I was able to get this as part of an oil deal at a local auto parts store free.If you get it cheaper than 10 it is an effective filter to use but 10 dollar price just for the filter is unjustifiable IMHO.Compared to Purolator Pure One filters this filter does not provide extra protection but it is double the price of Pure One.
5,Great oil filter,"One of the reasons I use K&N is the bolt on the end of the filter....both of my vehicles have the filter located in an out of the way place....what cars don't today? The 1 "" bolt head makes it much easier to take off the old filter....and according to tests, the filter is among the top in filtering capacity. I change oil at about 3-4K mile intervals and also use synthetic oil....cheap insurance IMHO !"
5,Excellent!,"I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about! This album is truly amazing... the mix of rhythm and native song is awesome. Not too much repetition in the beat and a nice soothing tone throughout. This hypnotic and meditative album will put you in ""another world"" so to speak."
5,Follow-ups a bear,"Trying to follow Tulku's first album is like where do we go from nirvana. Its always amazing when a group puts out one and only one absolutely perfect album. Stranger still when they can follow up with another. ""Season"" is well worth a listen, I mean, its still a way to get a sense of spiritual wholeness, that may percolate into the rest of your life. But ""Transcendence"" is like sitting in the fullness of love you've been missng all these years."
2,"Yeah, so what?","I freely admit this is harsh... Numerous others mix ambient/electronica with international flavors better than on this album. Most of these just seem light, uninspired droners with some cultural person moaning over them (this keeps it from being ambient or really danceable). Don't I seem the simpleton?"
4,Give it to your best friend!,"I was given this book and have since bought it several times over to give to several of my best girl friends. It's a great treat to give, receive and to read. Enjoyed it thoroughly."
4,Chinese dictionary,"I was looking for a Chinese dictionary and this seemed quite concise. However, the print is very small so what I intended to give as a gift was not to be so. The paper is not good quality. The positive is that it forces you to look carefully at the tone and character when you look up words."
3,"Do you understand the concept of ""Remix""","First, the average ELP fan probably won't like this, mainly because they would not understand the concept behind this. This is a techno influenced set, using some snippets of ELP songs throughout.Although different, this is an interesting take on their music and at least it is something new. It is is time to face facts, the boys are probably never going to release another piece of original music as a group again, and this is better than the yearly retreads that have been coming out for years."
1,No,"I will buy anything even remotely similar to this band. I will praise even sub-par releases from this band such as Love Beach and In The Hot Seat. I will defend this band to my last breath knowing they have been bashed and maligned relentlessly by the music press and so called ""rock critics"". I have seen this band perform live so many times I have lost count. But I will never understand the logic behind this release."
3,"Not your typical ELP, but typical TECHNO","Just as the title implies, these CDs are a ""re-workings"" of ELP material, and the year being 2002, that means Sampling and Electronica. The remixers took samples of ELP's Works and built new compositions out of it. The music certainly isn't ELP, but the _sounds_ are. It's very good mind you, from the concept side of things, but if you're coming at it from a techno persepective, it's very middle of the road. Ultimately, it comes across as nothing more than Jean Michel Jarre ...If you really want extreme, look out for KNOTS compilation, which tackles Gentle Giant samples into something truly bizarre."
2,disappointed,"I think this stylus is too short and too thin to go with the Casio. The price is right and the quality is fine, except that it unscrews at the top, I don't know what the purpose of that is. A part to lose possibly. It's just not what I was looking for."
3,Quite nice,"This is a nice item to get if you tend to misplace your stylus every now and then, like me. The grip of the pen is just like any ordinary stylus so there won't be any unfamiliarities. It wont fit to every PDA out there, so these pens will be great to be inside a pencil case or inside your pocket."
5,A prescription for self-healing,"This is one of the most inspiring books for self-empowered healing from mental illness I have read. In her childhood, Dr. Eve Wood learned that, ""If a person saves one life, it is as if he has saved the entire world."" By this criterion, Dr. Wood is saving the galaxy.The central theme in her patients' recoveries seems to be Dr. Wood's ability to help them create a safe container of self-acceptance without judgment and her considerable genius in inspiring hope. But she doesn't stop with just the storytelling. This is an interactive book in which she challenges the reader to explore how the patient's story might be relevant to ""you,"" the reader. Concluding each section are ""lessons,"" ""take home points,"" and questions that help the reader to assess her own imbalances.Throughout Medicine, Mind and Meaning, Dr. Wood offers exercises to help the reader fully integrate the ""lessons"" of the stories she tells. This book is, in itself, a prescription for self-healing."
5,plannning and administering early childhood programs,The book was brand new and it was a great buy for the price. Thanks.
5,Essential Watts,"This latest Alan Watts compilation, ""Zen: The Supreme Experience,"" contains previously unpublished manuscripts of his most lucid talks. The text is lavishly enhanced by photographs on high quality glossy stock. This volume may serve as either a great introduction or appropriate summary of his work for many generations of readers. Highly recommended."
4,Hmm,"Despite What above reviewer seems to think, When it comes to zen i do not think Alan Watts is a ""Master"" and the term zen prophet is just foolish. Mr. Watts does have a very unique and insightful look into eastern thought/religion and i do enjoy him very much. (I personally like the photos in this book the most, reminds me of places i've seen).If you like Alan Watts you will not be sad you purchased this book, But consider it as a ""coffee table"" book in your...hmm...zen collection.But remember you can read about zen all you want and you will have no idea, I didn't until i went to Japan, and China...Experiencing it is far greater than reading about it...."
2,"DISMAL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE!","This was a horrible movie. I hoped to see a bit more of the originality of the first ""Pokemon"" film (exciting and emotionally-charged). Instead, I see a remake of ""The Matrix"" for younger audiences. Funny moments save this dismal sequel. My advice: Skpi it! Grade: D+"
1,Slightly better than the first-but that's not saying much,"Okay, I've seen this one too, thanks to my brother. It shares many of the weaknesses of the first movie. It's based on a lousy TV show which is based (VERY loosely)on a mediocre video game. The second time around, they decide to introduce a bunch of new pokemon which confuses things even more. How do you keep track of over 200 little critters? The annoying Ash returns and I found it hard to believe that this rookie trainer somehow saves the world. Here is where the movies and TV shows differ from the video games. A player trying to use a pokemon team identical to Ash's will without a doubt face defeat time and again. To win the game you need to pick a team thats a bit stronger than Ash's collection of weaklings (believe it or not, pikachu is not a very strong pokemon in the game). Yet, despite his inherent weaknesses, Ash still manages to save the world. How he does it is a total mystery to me."
1,"Anime. Add cutesiness and prequel, = animation & plot","Yuck! How did Pokemon hit it big!? The plot in this anime/animation floatsom is terrible! And it's like Once Upon A Forest, the message it gives out to little kids is hackyed, and the animation is terrible. And there are 3 sequels to it? Now that is just wrong!"
2,"Adult's opinion: once popular, NOT ALWAYS popular","I'm 18, and not ACTUALLY an ""adult."" Even after watching the FIRST Pokemon movie, I still wasn't truly interested in Pokemon. They never once drove me to excitement to such an extent that I myself would catch them all. What in the world were the WB thinking, anyway, when they overmarketed this overrated piece of junk that like all things MUST die sooner or later? It did--once Digimon came along and put an end to the whole Pokemon thing for good, that is."
1,Good Anime is now widely available - Why buy this goop?,"Now that Disney is distrubuting almost all of Myazaki's films (The Cat Returns, Castle In The Sky, Porco Rosso, Spirited Away), so my question is ""Why buy this garbage?""Parents should keep kids away from unimaginative, poorly animated, commercial-filled toxic waste like Pokemon. This is pure mind control for kids - teaching them to buy cheap plastic junk.Show kids some quality Japanese Animation before its too late!"
4,Well done sequel,"The movie starts with the mini movie 'Pikachu's Rescue Adventure' that's better than 'Pikachu Vacation', the main movie is not as good as 'Mewtwo Strikes Back', but it has great effects, an exciting story, and memorable and good characters, like one of my favorite characters, the Pokémon god Lugia, and the only song that i think is good in the movie is 'Polkamon'.Every Pokémon should watch this movie, and learn something about the nature!"
4,I thought it rocked,"Ok.I loved this movie,I liked the first one but I loved this one. I thought the animation was fantastic,the dialogue was brilliant. ""I'd hate to be hit by their droppings""hee hee hee. I thought the movie also sent out a really important message that one person can make a differnce so always try.I loved it.If you think about buying this for your kids I think it would be a smart move.Most adults don't understand it but try to think of your kids enjoyment.I mena people whine about it so kiddish but I love it and I'm 14.Movie critics think of it as a kids movie and they say it stinks and they couldn't be more wrong.The Movie was amazing also really sweet.So so sweet and funny.Plus I think any AAMl fan would enjoy it.I did.Not the organistation but I think was one of the best I ever saw.IT ROCKED. Nibbs"
2,"Personally, I don't like it, but my little brother...","My little brother loves this movie, so whenever I have to baby-sit him, I just stick it in the VCR and press play. It's a great tool for baby-sitting teenagers to use on young kids. And I don't really have anything against the movie. I mean, it's got a cute concept, but when you hear Pokemon this and Pokemon that it can get annoying. If you're buying it for a younger sibling or your child, keep that in mind."
5,LOVE this movie!!,I first saw this movie in the year 2000 when I was 8 years old and I LOVE it!! The movie is very fun and the music is awesome! Watching this DVD brings back wonderful childhood memories!!
5,Pokemon Rules,Yet another great Pokemon movie. My daughter loves it. I watch it with her too and its entertaining for me as well.
4,"The powers of ice, fire and lightning collide!","In Pokemon the Movie 2000, a pokemon collector sets out to find the rarest flying pokemon there is. Legend has it, if you bring together the gods of ice, fire and lightning you'll awaiken the god of the sea and the earth will head for destruction. The collector hopes to capture the beast from the sea no matter what the costs. This movie had great special effects and lots of laughs, so if you haven't already seen it buy it on video!!!"
4,better than the mew two videos,this movi is da bomb! it doesnt have much story or the story is a bit well weird.the extra mini movie of it rocks and is kool.it is a very nice movie to watch with your familly.but it would have been better if they put more story and less battles :)
5,An adventure that will never be forgotten!,"The power of one: get set for an unforgettable adventure featuring all new Pokemon! An ancient legend comes true when Pokemon Articuno,Zapdos and Moltres are disturbed after centuries of harmony. As the very forces of nature come unbalanced. Life on earth depends on the unlikely teaming of the mythical Pokemon Lugia and a mysterious chosen one foretold in the legend. Can Ash Ketchum summon the courage to save the day? See how one person can make all the difference."
1,"The 2000 Countdown, down, down","This movie is one of the most idiotic, stupid, fictional, unrealistic, badly-graphiced pokemon movies ever. All the great luck Ash wasn't shocked and he just happened to have Misty as a friend. This move should be popped into the sea!@#$%^&*"
4,Great movie!,We certainly enjoyed this movie in the wonderful series of the Pokemon adventures. Must see!
5,"My kids love it, just like the other ones.","Just like the other Pokèmon movies, my kids love them. They like the fact that they can fast-forward/rewind to the exact point they want to see, listen to the commentaries, play the games, etc. I recommend it for kids who love Pokèmon. :o)"
5,UNEXPLAINLY ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR 2000!,"Since i saw the first Pokemon movie boy, i was dissapointed,but this one it's really very great, it's beautifuly written with, avery candy eye,and it's very exciting and smart, ENJOY!"
4,I love Pokemon!,"I confess, I am a 25 year old who loves Pokemon! This movie was very cute. It's really a disaster movie, like Independence Day, but with Pokemon. There are definately parallels with the James Bond series (the rich, evil villan), Deep Impact (natural disaster sequences), and Armageddon (the world waits in terror as one man saves the world), but this is really for kids and adults who have not grown up!"
2,Ehhh...,pretty quick shipping but the case was in rough shape disc was good would have preferred more description overall i like the product just not what i paid for it.
1,Loud clashing drum sounds ruin the bells,Years ago I used the original of this work for meditation.This remastering ruins the original and in my opinion is totally unsuitable for meditation. Try Tibetan Bowls instead.The item was returned for resale.
3,Reflect your mood,"I have been using them for my sessions, but be warned that if you are in a middle to negative mood, it will seem scary/dark to you. If you're in a very positive mood, even the sharpness of the metal bells will not seem too loud and you will fall into a very deep trance. My clients agreed, so I put the CD last when we're already in a positive mood."
5,Hardware,"The product came in really good time, the merchand was quick to answer any questions I had and the product looks great! As compared to The Great Indoors I saved over $3 on each pull.Great buy!"
5,very pleased !!,"Service was amazing. Product arrived in 4 days.Look amazing in my kitchen. The only down side, is the handle is slightly concave on back instead of being smooth. Not a problem, just different. Could not beat the price !!"
5,Hilarious and gentle,"No, this is not a social pamphlet -- nor do we want it to be. But it certainly does have ""socially redeeming value"", given that Bertie Wooster is a magnanimous, kind, caring man with wonderful manners, who would never let a pal down. And Jeeves is much the same, but with an intellect. Theirs is a civilized world, even if things do go wrong... Wodehouse is delightful to read."
1,Not funny or romantic!,"I can't for the life of me understand why they would call this a Romantic comedy. There was nothing funny and nothing romantic about this man's love infatuations. And if that isn't bad enough he is describing all his affairs with his impressionable young daughter. Ugh..... I give it a big thumbs down. This movie is a waste of your time and money. Then the ending..... Really????? Very disappointing, to say the least."
3,"Maybe, Definitely","Ok, I have to say this was a unique idea in a story format. It was interesting and cute. I liked the ending also. I would have to say this was worth the watch, but it's more of a ""chick flick"" I think. I'm usually not into this sort of movie (I bought it out of boredom and because it was cheap), but it's one I would watch again down the road. I think most people would enjoy this."
2,Definitely a waste of time,"2.5 stars. A bland and unrealistic plot (like the little girl wouldn't have known whether her mother was a writer or not). The actors were fine, but there's nothing memorable about this movie. At no time did I get the warm fuzzies or was I rooting for Will to get the girl of his dreams. There's a similar premise to the movie Serendipity (it even includes a thread about a lost book) with the idea of love needing the right timing. Watch at your own risk."
1,"Definantely, Maybe, Ok Not..But I So Wanted To Love It","I'm such a fan of Ryan Reynolds, and even Rachel Weisz, but this particular movie wasn't charming or moving enough to fulfill my expectations. Yes, Reynolds is his usual handsome, playful, self (I've enjoyed him since the 2 Guys and a Girl days), quipping about with witty banter while going through his love life memory lane of regrets and pleasures, but the somber mood in parts of this movie dulled him down and the graphic inquisitive tongue of his daughter is a little quick and far too informed for her age (inappropriately so)."
1,junk,this movie is a waste of time - lots of blah blah junk nonsensical lines which is an insult to intelligence. a few good lines. couldn't handle spending the time so fast forwarded.
1,Kids are not suppose to be your advisor,"Dad rehashes his sordid life complete with bad habits of all sorts and expects his pre-teen daughter to help solve all of his problems. Too many parents, especially in divorce or separation use their children as crutches and friends. Too bad, I like all of the actors/actresses but this is a depressing story that moves slowly and painfully through all of the gutters of his life in plain view of his daughter."
1,Definitely not,Surprising how they think it is acceptable for a little girl to have so much sexual knowledge and ask her dad inappropriate questions. It was a total turn off.
5,A TRUE GEM OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY!!,"A very cute comedy, It reminds me of my little girl Amie.It's great to be a father and have boy's, but your not a trueDaddy til you have a little girl!!As well life doesn't always turn out the way we thought it might.I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!"
1,Appalled,"I was totally shocked to find out that the frank dialogue was between the underage child and her father. To have a child that young talk that explicitly is just wrong. I say shame on Universal Studios and Abigail's parents for encouraging her to be in PG-13 movies and to be the reason for the rating. If I had known that the frank dialogue on the rating was from a child no older than mine, I would not have rented it and will get my money back from movie gallery. I think they should have to say frank dialogue from underage child. I was also suprised to only find one other review in the 15 to 20 I looked at that mentioned how much it bothered them. It was so unacceptable and not needed, It could have been a good movie without all of that sexual dialogue and promiscuity in the plot. I could not finish the movie and will no longer spend my money for Universal Studios or Abigail Breslin's family to use to make more trashy movies. Shame, shame on Universal Studios and Abigail Breslin's family."
2,Renyolds is so bland.,"What did the critics see in his performance. It's about as bland as you can find in a movie. As for the little girl who played his daughter, she is annoying as Jar Jar Binks."
2,no french subtitles....,"A little deception with this title.French is my natural language, so I like to have a french option.The french dubbed version avalaible here is an horrific canadian one, and I've the bad surprise to see that this title has no french subtitle (normally ALL the Universal one have it)"
4,Fun movie!,"I'm not sure which I enjoyed more - the practical, nonsensical perspective of the daughter or the delicious storytelling, but Ryan Reynolds gracefully bows to let both steal the show. Loved it!"
2,Boring,Just not my kind of enjoyable movie. Moves to slowly and didn't keep my attention. Just wasn't what I thought it would be.
3,It has a certain charm..,"Will (Ryan Reynolds) is in the middle of a divorce. His young daughter Maya (Abigail Breslin) is becoming interested in romantic things, so he decides to tell her the story about how he met her mother. The catch is that he seriously dated two other women during the years that he dated the woman who later became his wife. He begins to spin the tale of his three love affairs (giving the women different names) and Maya tries to discern which one was to ultimately marry her father. The positives in the movie include a pretty good script, and good performances, especially from the female member of the cast. The story does seem to drag a little in the middle, and the romantic near-misses become frustrating at times, but the story does have a certain charm, and the ending contains a nice little twist."
1,definately maybe,"It is slow starting, to use Abigail Breslin to sell the story was contrived and embarassing to the young star. The story was hard to follow, and not very engaging. The movie makes you feel like you wasted your time and cheap."
2,Not worth it,"I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I've seen worse, but I personally didn't like it. I thought it was rather dirty and the story wasn't that good."
1,Extremely boring,How can people dupe actors into making something so boring? Do they really need the money that bad? That about sums up this movie. Losers looking for work.
4,Buy it ! Definitely....maybe!,"Being a Ryan Reynolds fan, I was purely entertained with this film. With it's ""How I met your mother"" storyline, I was pleased how it all fell together. Reynolds is an all around great actor. I will buy it!...Definitely!"
4,"Definitely, Maybe is wonderful.",Recommended to me by some friends at work. Great movie. Good acting and I enjoyed the little girl so much. Movies like this are very appealing to me.
4,Really enjoyed this,"The little girl absolutely stold the show! She was funny, witty and mature for her age. I have two daughters and both of them loved it!"
4,"A nice, different change",I thought this movie was a nice change to the more common format of Romantic Comedies. I enjoyed the interaction between Ryan Reynolds and Abigail Breslin. I thought the casting of the women was great. The story held my interest in trying to figure out which woman he married. Great movie in my opinion.
2,it was OK,"I didn't really like the story as much as I thought I would. The whole ""I wont tell you who the mother is"" was cute until the end. It didn't really make as much sense as I thought it would."
4,Wonderful story,I love the way the father tells his story through his daughter. The evolvement of the characters through the years is done very well.
5,"A great, funny and yet touching love story.",I loved this movie! It has all the makings of a classic.I highly recommend it.
3,This reviewer said it best IMHO,"Definitely Maybe, July 24, 2008By Nancy Brown Johnston ""TripleWin"" (Tennessee, USA) -This was definitely, maybe a good romantic comedy - just fell a little short but was still cute.MeIt is hard not to like the characters in this film...esp the women (I am a guy and do like romantic comedies). There is something about Isla Fisher (what is she doing with thay Sasha Baron Cohen guy) j/k.) that I like.The part where he (Reynald's)says something to the effect that he did not see Isla Fisher's character going for someone like him...please. did she have to throw herself in front of a train to prove it.We sure like when love conquors all."
3,I wanted to love this movie....,...as much as I love Notting Hill and Love Actually but I found the pace of the movie slow and found myself not caring about the characters as I had in other films. I hope we get to see more of Ryan Reynolds as he is a solid actor but the plot just didn't move me.
1,don't waste your money!,"A cd has to be really great or really bad to make me write a review. In this case it's the latter. It's hard to imagine how someone could take such a selection of talented artists and produce such a crappy cd. The audio quality is some of the worst I've ever heard. On most of the songs,the lead guitar is lost under the booming muddy bass. It's like listening to a recording of a garage band on AM radio. If the artists on this cd,ever heard this cd,they would be embarassed.There are no liner notes. Never heard of this label,never want to again. I would have rated it""no stars"",but one is the lowest allowed. Don't be fooled by the group of people playing on this cd,or the price(I was!). Don't waste your money!"
2,Stilted and unimpressive read,"I had hoped to enjoy this book, iti s supposedly about a woman, Norah, who has an obsession with New zealand Writer, Katherine Mansfield - and it is also a novel of returning home (to Sydney) to examine the past and the future.She runs into her old boyfriend, no longer a seemingly useless and skinny migrant, but a successful man. Her family - her father, her brother and her seemingly difficult sister. No one is there to help her - they all seem incapable of helping themselves.Words such as 'lyrical', 'poignant' and 'critical acclaim' have been used to describe this book, all I can say on this is let that be your warning. The substance of this book is thin and unsatisfactory."
3,Hard to properly install but...,"consider the alternative. I've used this product for over a year now and it's literally saved my iPAQ's screen numerous times, both from stylus scratches and things dropped on the screen. Follow the instructions, clean the screen, make sure it's dust and lint free, start at the top of the screen and work your way down, be patient and work with it. The small bubbles are virtually invisible when the screen is lighted anyway. I've only managed once to completely get ALL the bubbles out but even with a few small bubbles, I wouldn't be without one on my iPAQ."
4,"Works fine, takes practice","I've been using these for about a year and they work very well, in my experience lasting for several months. They improve the feel of the screen, but I haven't noticed that they improve visibility...on the other hand they don't seem to degrade it either.In my case they have not damaged the screen in any way, they remove very cleanly so you can use a new sheet.They take practice to apply, and each of us will figure out our own technique. It's important to clean the screen first, and do the application in a lint free environment like a bathroom as opposed to your computer desk.Don't panic when you see some bubbles after the application, they will go away by themselves in a few days...but you really should try to get most of them eliminated during the application process if possible.I'm very satisfied with the product, all things considered."
1,Poor Design,"Blurs images slightly, actually reduces handwriting recognition (more recognition mistakes-less tolerant), and the ""Fellows"" label on the overlay actually covers part of the toolbar. Must be something better out there somewhere."
2,Good - But Could be Better,I think they could have picked a MUCH better selection of her live tunes than this. They're ok and maybe a must have for Sia/Zero 7 fans...but it doesn't really do her talent justice.
3,Good but...,"I'm a big fan of Sia and I heard about this CD and bought it instantly without reading reviews or anything, to my surprise there where only 9 songs and one of them was a new one so it wasn't live. Anyways, her singing is beautiful, I recommend you buy it if you are a truly Sia fan, if not, waste your money in something else =)"
3,its good,i wouldm recommend this product.it is decent dalue for your money.toner price on this may be a little steep
4,Using to align portable satalite dish,This tool was recomended by our DirecTV tech to help us easily align our portable dish - hope we can get the hang of it!
4,Well worth the money,"These three fiddlers from Missouri are my favorites outside of Arthur Galbraith and Howard Marshall. One thing you will find on this album that you won't find on a lot of Missouri fiddlers' albums is the fine, three, ""barefingered"" banjo playing of the late Lena Hughes. Mrs. Hughes is one of the few banjo players I have ever heard who can properly accompany fiddle tunes. If you are an old time fiddle fan, especially, the Missouri fiddle style this CD is well worth the money.Arkansas Red-Ozark Mountains, Arkansas"
1,SUCKS,"Don't buy this thing. The buttons are spaced incorrectly and hard to press. The Star Power doesn't and has never worked.I contacted TAC and they don't seem willing to replace a defective product - granted it's out of warranty but I am sure they recognize they have issues with the very first production runs.And finally, if I want it to work with Guitar Hero II, I have to buy an additional adapter from TAC. IMO they don't deserve any more of my money for producing such garbage."
1,JUNK,BEWARE GUITAR HEROS!! this is not the axe for you. The design and feel is great. When it comes to actually playing the game it couldn't be more frustrating. the Whammy bar didn't work right out of the box. the controler would shut on an off during the middle of the song. star power function does not work unless you hit the select button. stick to the wired original. hope this has helped.
4,Ol Faithful,"""Good range. No lag. On the first night I had it I got drunk, and like a true Rock Star, I smashed it on the ground after giving the performance of a life time. Although now it's held together with duct tape, it still works like a dream. I'm very satisfied."""
1,wireless guitar hero2,This item broke down before a month passed. Would suggest others to order the wired controller
4,I like it,i recieved the guitar in great shape an it is easier to play than the reactrocker i have..the fret's are ez touch an i like that..i customized it with some of the stickers that came with it an i get compliments on it..Shades401
4,Pop Idol 2 Winner Rocks,"Michelle McMaunus may not have to chops to hit the US yet, but she is a great british singer. She has an awesme voice and all this time is a really great song. If you like this song, you will love Will Young, who is my opinion is a little better than Michelle, but both are wonderful singers with awesome songs."
2,Poor performing,I sent this poor performing lens back and opted for the slightly more expensive Canon 75-300 mm USM. The autofocus speed difference is like night and day. Happy I made the switch.
2,Should not say MACRO,I bought this lens and wish now I had not. I was looking for a real macro lens and with a focal point in macro of 37.4 it does not produce the photos I want. I saw no difference in the normal photos and ones with the macro switched on. It is alright as a general lens but don't expect the clairity and quality that you would get with higher end lenses. I'd rate this ho-hum.
2,I wanted to like this book but,"I wanted to like this book; a veteran of the 34th telling it like it was, and it seems that the author is a decent Christian gentleman too. He is very telling on the scandalously unfair way the riflemen were treated and he speaks with what seems to be a voice from the trenches. Even when he is wrong, and he can be so wrong he seems mad at times, he can be forgiven because these may the opinions of the riflemen of that time. Unfortunately no-one edited this book and it is marred by a remarkable amount of repetition. There's a lot of chapters and in each one the same stories, the same complaints, appear again, sometimes twice. In the end it is almost impossible to bear to start the next chapter. A nice man, but you had better be very interested in the GIs of the 34th Division because this is a very hard read."
5,Great Tool,I currently attend college and I am the leader of a bible study here on campus. Usually our studies are conducted inductively and we ask questions to learn more about the specific passages. This tool really helps answer some questions in a way that is understandable and conveyable. The more controversial issues in the Bible that may be interpreted different by different denominations are also stated in the book. It explains breifly both viewpoints and lets you decide for yourself.
5,Quest Study Bible is what I have been looking for!,"Maps, questions, explanations...everything I've been hoping to find in my first bible. And there aren't a lot of 'thees and thous"" in it. Written in common evertday English."
5,Great!,"This version is very easy to read and the breaks out explanations are very insightful. They can be trivial at times, buts all in all extremely informative."
4,Recommend,This bible is a great study bible. It answered a lot of questions that I had as well as provided clarity.
4,NIV Quest Study Bible,"The NIV Quest Study Bible has a unique system of questions and answers that fill in a lot of information that you might not otherwise find in the Bible. It answers a lot of ""why"" questions and expands the passages in really eye-opening ways. I find that this system helps me understand the Bible in a whole new way. I highly recommend it for those who want to dig deeper in their study of the bible."
5,Wonderful!,This is a wonderful Bible that you can actually enjoy reading. I really look forward to reading every night when I get into the bed. It's relaxing to read b/c it's interesting now that you can understand what's really going on and how to apply to your life. I love this Bible and highly recommend it!
3,A Study Bible for Conservative Christians,"This study Bible is written from a conservative point of view. (Because it does not have a point of view that I share, I rarely use it.) Its material is presented in an interesting and approachable manner. It is aimed at a general audience -- not seminarians or very knowledgable laypersons.It would be a good choice for a conservative Christian. If you are a very knowledgable conservative Christian, there are probably better choices for you."
2,Lacking clear thinking....,"Any book that's a ""reaction"" to another book (in this case Daniel Callahan's ""False Hopes : Why America's Quest for Perfect Health Is a Recipe for Failure""), should be read very carefully. In this case, it shouldn't be read at all. This book is not ""full of crap"" as some people might say, but it obviously lacks clear thinking. However it's worth a read just to see how illogical it is......Not worth your money."
2,,"Ten seconds into the first track ""Witness to the fall"" and you instantly know these guys' affinity for all things Gothenburg. Fortunately, that aspect only comes to play on a few areas on this album, the rest of the music focuses on playing nu-melodic death metal with some thrash elements thrown in for good measure (""Halo Ruin"" being the prime example of this with its familiar thick chugging). The marriage of thrash and death these days is a risky one, and most bands end up sounding the same. Enforsaken ends up with a face without identity, but you definitely could do worse. At least these guys are just a bit above when it comes to the aggressiveness level, but it isn't enough to stand apart from the overcrowded crowd."
2,It will do in a pinch,"The product description clearly states it fits my Sig 229. Well, I was able to make it fit, but it is tight! I have to hold one hand on the holster while I use my strong arm to muscle it in or out. If you don't use a hand to hold the holster in place you can give yourself a wedgy trying to withdraw the weapon. It is made out of two pieces of hard plastic and when I put my weapon in, it forces the seams to spread and the quality of the rivets holding it together look like they could break at any time. I normally use a Galco tuckable, but now and then I need/want to carry on the outside, so I got what I paid for."
5,I may be in over my head!!,"I am only on the 7th day and already have a handful of new books I want to read!! This little calendar, mounted to my kitchen wall, gives me a great start to every day--just enough about each book to whet my appetite and know whether I want to pursue looking up the book, or wad the page up and trash it. Ideal for book lovers of any age or background!!"
4,Very Intersting,"If you like getting to know the people behind the characters, this show is for you. I was surprised how many cast members were from other countries, the american accent is impeccable."
4,A GOOD ONE FOR FANS,A GOOD ONE FOR FANS OF THE SHOW HIGHLY INFORMATIVE WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SILLYNESS TMROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE............
1,Bad product - Do not buy it,"I never recommended anybody before not to buy a product. I recieved this item today and When I tried to open and use this product, the top opening cover is not opening completely and CD is not turning on (Though Radio is working OK). At first I suspected damage due to packaging/shipping. I closely examined and found that the top opening plastic cover is made delicately and not correctly sitting on the base. A small test of pusing the cover when closed reveals the movement by sideways. Even though the price is low, it is a waste of time to gamble than buying a market tested durable product that works. I am disappointed.... Especially If you buy it online return process is time consuming, discouraging and a real pain.... And I need to reconsider my online buying practice too..."
1,Citizen CD-230 Portable,After a year and a half and little use. The unit doesn't work. I have mixed feelings about this. I would not buy again.
1,Defective,Mine arrived with the volume control broken. It played at one volume and wouldn't change regardless of where I set the volume control. I'm returning mine....
3,"Great content, but the pictures...","New fisherman, new to Florida...hence the book.The explanations of the fishing environment are first class, even for a novice like me. Some of the points are made with pictures though, and they are close to useless...b/w, grainy, smudged.On balance, not a bad purchase, but I don't know why they bothered with the pictures."
1,Great idea. Horrible execution.,"I'm a pro cabinetmaker. I do a lot of punch out with a cadex pin nailer. Very light usage. I went through three of these units, all with the leaking problem. The hose also burst on me. Just blew apart, mid hose. What the heck? With all of the returns, I don't know why this product is still on the shelves. Harbor Freight would have more dignity than to sell product as bad as this. But Lowes? The hassle of going to the paintball store adds insult to injury. I'm back to hauling the pancake around."
5,Product Review,"Love this product. I'm in technical theatre. Really makes life in my profession much easier. I don't have to carry around hoses or air compressors. It's fantastic. CO2 refills can be pricey, But all in all it's great."
1,waste of money,"I would have given this 5 stars 4 years ago when it was new..After using maybe 20 times it has proven to be an increasingly frustrating tool..You have to take the regulator off of the tank after every use or all of the CO2 will leak out overnite..Taking the regulator off ruins the o-ring,so a new one is needed everytime it's used..I know o-rings are cheap but after a while it get to be a pain..add that to the fact that over time more gas leaked out when putting on and taking off the regulator and it truly was a waste of money..I finally gave up and got a Porter Cable C1010 compressor on sale at Home Depot for $79.00 plus another $20 for airhose,well worth it.The only plus I can give this is that it's quiet."
3,Pandora's box,"I am a long time reader of Deathlands, and have read it through the highs and lows that every series goes through. However, with Pandora's...a lack of continuity and editorial work has continued to plague a top notch adventure series. The reading of this book, from a stand alone perspective is quite enjoyable. The action scenes and probability explorations of a futureworld after a holocaust are well done, giving the reader a feel for the post-nuke Deathlands. But a lack of understanding for the main characters of the series hurts it greatly. Longtime readers of the series will understand what I mean. Character interaction and development seems to have become a thing of the past, with the cast only going from one battle to another. They are slowly becoming cardboard cutouts without depth. However, I continue reading in hopes that an overall storyline will again make itself felt. All in all, a fair Deathlands fix, but a lowering of the quality of the goods."
4,Ragtime with a twist,"I consider myself a respectable music critic, and although I am not a resident in the land of ragtime, this cd is breathtaking. Craig is a phenomenal guitarist, able to blend common rag techniques with an unforgiving intensity and somewhat chromatic flair that can keep you comfortably enjoying his music while breathing heavily in anticipation of his next tangential masterpiece. Anyone interested in in rag or blues should give this a chance, as true talent can never be avoided."
4,nice filter,I have been using k&n stuff for over 20 years. The nut on these filters can be a real time saver on some of the import cars like our infiniti g20. as far as filtration thier not quite up to hasting filters
5,filter,this is an oil filter for cars. it filters things. this is a filter. this is an oil filter for cars. it filters things. this is a filter.
3,...,"dont get me wrong, it's a great filter. but I dont like the design on how to take this off the car."
5,better MPG,"I have an 2011 Nissan Rogue. when I first bought it grand new. it showed 26-27 MPG average on local and highway conditions. then, I changed oil every 4000 miles at an Nissan dealer. my MPG average showed about 24.5-25.4. then I used Mobil 1 extended oil filter with mobile one extended oil. MPG is getting worse. I only get 22.5-24 mpg. then this time I used K&N HP-1008 oil filter with Mobile 1 extended oil. my MPG shows 28-29mpg, and runs 26.4 miles local. and 28.5-32 miles freeway. average out about 27 with more of local then highway mile."
5,cheaper than local,"I'm glad amazon started selling auto parts. Cheaper than local, no ship/no tax. As for this particular filters performance, well, I haven't sampled the oil and screened it analytically for decomposition. If something bogus happens in the next year I'll definitely call K&N *and* update this review."
1,This is Democrat humor,"When you lose an election, stomp on all your sour grapes and then make pulp for paper on which to print your whiney liberal tomes. This coloring book is the low point in Democrat commentary. This is what they are left with after the ""serious"" Bush-bashing books are read successively in a frenzy of Bush-hating.I also can get tongue-tied and I would probably look foolish if someone were recording my every word and compiling a list of mispronunciations, stutters and foot-in-mouth comments. So would probably a lot of other people. It's funny what liberals resort to criticizing when they've run out of steam on all their other complaints. They seem to prefer a president who appears to be a great speaker, but with low moral character, than a president who is man of integrity but who sometimes stumbles over words. Even the apostle Paul said people criticized him for his lack of eloquence."
1,"I'm a Republican, So I Hate It",Written by a typical female. Stop your tree-hugging! Make a good coloring book why don't you? Love it or leave it! These colors don't bleed no matter how many crayons you use!
1,How cute a coloring book for bedwetting liberals,The John Kerry version was cancelled because it gave the children nightmares.
3,Lamp Timer,This replaced a very old non-digital timer that was no longer accurate. I found it a little difficult to set correctly but it is working very well.
3,Why the batteries?????,"A great product, easy to use and it works well for small appliances. My issue is with the batteries. Its plugged into a wall outlet. It is a stupid design to require batteries-which by the way seem to only last about 4 months"
3,"Alright, second time around","First one ordered didn't keep time accurately. Good ol' Amazon works like a charm though!!! 5 stars! I returned it and got a new one immediately! Now it works fine. Just as described. Nothing too amazing though. I use it as an alarm since it is really dark outside in the winter and it helps wake me up. However, it would be cool if it slowly dimmed the lights on and off."
5,Intermatic TB121C Digital Tabletop Lamp and Appliance Timer,I love it. It is very easy to set up. You don't need to look in the manual. It serves as a clock on the end table and I don't need to bend under the table or to the outlet if I wish to override the timer. It arrived on time and in an excellent condition. It is a perfect gift for older people but it can be enjoyed by all ages.
5,Best timer on the market!,"This timer works great, simple, very easy to set and most importantly: it is reliable! The best I've found and what a great price!"
1,Useless for appliances,This product cannot be used with any appliance that has a three-pronged plug. That the product description does not mention this is negligent on Amazon's part.
5,Excellent form factor,"This unit solves two problems. Firstly it's an on/off timer for light loads with two ons and two offs per day. Secondly it provides a very useful remote on/off switch for things like theIndus-Tool TT Toasty Toes Ergonomic Heated Footrest. It's very easy to set the time and change the timers and it clearly indicates whether power is flowing to the controlled appliance.The on and off timers can be programmed independently which makes this unit particularly useful if you want to use it to make sure that an appliance is not left turned on (like the heated footrest mentioned above). Just set a couple of ""off"" times without any ""on"" times and the appliance wont be left turned on for more than a few hours."
4,A nice timer for appliances,"I searched high and low for a coffee maker with a timer that had across the board good reviews. I gave up and attached my old Mr. Coffee to this device. It is now telling me that the batteries are low, and I am not sure if they are designed to kick in when there is a power outage or if batteries are necessary to run the thing. It was intuitive to program, even before I had my coffee."
1,Useless on most items,This item does not work with any item that has a ground.Therefore it is useless on anything but lamps.
2,looks beautiful..........performance questionable,It is a beautiful unit...................looks good sitting on the table. Easy to set time of day and times you want a light or appliance to start and stop. Problem is that the batteries (takes 2 button size which were priced at $6.99 each at Batteries Plus) seem to run out withina year or so and the cost of a new unit vs. new batteries is pretty much the same!
4,So far works great,Functions great so far (1 month). Setting time and on off cycles easy. Temporarily overriding cycle very easy. Only need for backup batteries prevents 5 star rating.
2,A Sleepy collection of of Delta Blues,"Its hard to write an objective review on such a subjective topic as music, but I will be fair and say that the quality of the recordings, considering they are taken from recordings done from about 1925 to the 40s, are good, a credit to they who mastered the album. The selections are not really rare for the most part, so it might have been nice to have some lesser known artists and selections as part of the compilation. Frankly, it put me to sleep, I probably wont spin it again, because having heard it once, ""the thrill is gone"" from this American Roots Songbook."
5,Running out of breath?,"Our culture encourages us to be busy, that somehow doing a lot equates success. There is a price to that:our relationship with God. It's hard to hear HIm, let alone build relationships with your precious ones when you are constantly on the go. This book was written mainly for the MOPS crowd, but I read it when I had no pre-schoolers but was in an utter state of burn-out due to over-commitment to my church, and outside activities. Great encouragement to find balance in your life, and get your priorities back in order. I have read this book twice now, and love the wisdom and encouragement. Light read, but chock full of reality!"
1,dont get it,"reception with this thing is lousy. It periodically 'stalls' when you're moving the mouse. very annoying. I have it on a desk right next to another (different brand) cordless kb/mouse, and that one works fine.I highly suggest you buy something else."
2,Ricky Van Shelton CD,The CD was blemished and it skips after several songs. I could not find the paperwork in order to return the product.
5,A must for those facing serious illnesses in the family,"A beginners guide to meditations, without any technical stuff.Following these meditations really helps to develop and maintain inner peace while facing extremely difficult times.It is great for both the patient and the family."
2,Poor quality,"Wore the earrings twice and the device that you secure them in broke, not very good quality."
4,Usual Nicolle/McBride,"The experienced Osprey reader should already know the jist of this book just by the names of the author and the artist. For anyone else, this title combines dry, raw history from a very anti-Western perspective with eight spirited colored plates.The Mamluks were a continuation of medieval Islamic civilization, holding together the conquests of their forebearers by several centuries of constant warfare, which finally ended with a defeat by the Ottomans at Cairo in 1517."
3,Easy access to basic information,"This book is good if you want an overview of sharepoint. Do you need a deeper knowledge you have to look elsewhere.The book is well written, with focus on getting through most of the subjects of sharepoint 2003.Today it might be a little out of date, as the new sharepoint 2007 is available."
5,SAMS SharePoint 2003,"Simple, straightforward and easy to follow.An excellent step by step guide, and a good reference manual."
5,SharePoint reference and starter,I found this book to be a godsend win I first started using SharePoint at work. It's small and easily tabbable. This book will get you off and running with SharePoint and how to use it. I recommend this book to all new personnel who come to my work. Great starter book.
4,Useful SharePoint reference material,Have found the book useful in researching specific issues/procedures for my novice to intermediate use of SharePoint. Our company's internal training program recommended this book and I have found our utilization of the product is a close match to the material in the book which is a great bonus!
4,interesting show,it was an interesting show...it shows a side of them you wouldnt really expect....too bad till death do us part wasnt really ment.why are you guys selling this show for 70 dollars????that is a ridiculous price...
3,Plastic holsters are not very good,"The one positive feature of this hostler is that once the firearm is holstered it holds it secure from falling out. You can adjust it so that the firearm rattles in it and yet won't fallout.the negative feature is that is a hard plastic that takes a lot of playing with to adjust to you pistol. I even put an object in the holster and set it in the sun,....voila...by nightfall it was perfect. Next day I holstered my pistol which went in easily and my nightfall I could not get that pistol out without taking the holster off and using a screw driver to pry it loose. If and that's a big IF, they had adjusting screws they would have a winner. But alas there are no adjustments. So I bought a Galco leather holster with adjust adjustment screws and it works fine."
3,good but incomplete,"This CD is good, but it's incomplete. It contains all of the rock songs, but it is missing alot of Vince DiCola's instrumental tunes (Unicron's theme is missing!)This CD was released in the 80's, the days when vinyl records were still sold, and recordings of sondtracks and albums had a limited amount of space to record on an album; so there are a not as many tracks.This CD soundtrack (like many others from the 80's) is a direct port from the vinyl record to CD. So it only contains about 10 songs.If u like the rock songs from the movie and you dont mind missing out on the instrumental, than get this CD. If you really want Vince DiCola's instrumentals, than this CD will get you disapointed"
5,Most Excellent album of synth rock,"I wore out 8 cassette tapes in the 80s and 90s listening to this soundtrack over and over. What can I say about it, other than it ROCKS! In my opinion, this album was a defining moment in cartoon soundtracks. From the dirge of Death of Optimus Prime to the high adrenaline sound of Dare, this album by far and away the BEST soundtrack of the era. Artists like Vince DiCola and Stan Bush have defined the sound that came from this album. My only wish is that there were another album or 2 of this music!"
5,chris schuster,This is THE soundtrack to one of the best animated films of the 80's. The best tracks are of course the rare (possibly only) hits of stan bush and white lion. I love this CD like I love air. Buy it now. If you are reading this than you have seen the movie and are interested. Thats all you need to love this CD.
5,One of the rare occasions when a I must buy the soundtrack,"It is not very often when I buy a soundtrack. Trust me I am not in the least a huge music fan. However after viewing the movie and the music that went with it I knew I had to own this.After purchasing this I can't stop listening ot it, this is some of the best 80's music I have ever heard. It surprised my friends and family.Obviously the key song on this track is the theme by the group Lion. The remastering of the theme is marvalouse. However it is not the best track, in fact the best track is Dare which is just a tiny bit better.If you like 80's music, or good music...than this is for you."
5,The Best Movie soundtrack for the best movie of all time,"This is simply the best movie soundtrack i have ever heard. On top of that, the movie kicked ass!. A perfect soundtrack to a perfect movie"
5,Amazing stuff,"Anyone reading this probably doesn't need further convincing of how great this material is. But if you would like info on how to obtain the ENTIRE score for the film, and other Transformers-related music, feel free to email me at flashback@yahoo.com."
2,Not Good......,"Not good, not good at all. If your reading this then you are a Transformers fan, one who has seen the animated movie and enjoyed it. And why not, I always argued that seeing all the characters locked in a battle to the death satisfied me after seeing so many episodes where no one got hurt somehow. But, if there's one aspect of this movie that hasn't aged well it's the songs. ""You Got The Touch"" ruins the greatest scene in the movie (where Optimus Prime decides to finally make the Decepticons his prison bunnies) and the lyrics and music are SO corny that it'll have even the biggest TF fans wincing. If your a fan get the movie and enjoy, pay no mind to the soundtrack. No mind at all."
5,Back In Time,"Okay, so what if people like to ""go back and re-live the 80s"", all I know is that this is the BEST soundtrack ever. Well, of a cartoon movie. I mean I grew up on Transformers, I already have the movie, and my brother still has all of the original transformers action figures. So this will go great with my collection. This soundtrack, for me, is like bringing back apart of my childhood. Even though I four, but I still remember Transformers. Plus, the songs ROCK."
3,Soundtrack? Guess again!,"The background music for ""The Transformers: The Movie"" is not very properly used. Actually, the music is not background. It has vocals in every place (except in the instrumental versions and the ""Autobot-Decepticon Battle"" theme). If you feel nostalgic for 80's style rock, and you are fan of the Transformers, this CD is for you. However, if you buy it just because you're a Transformers fan, you should see the Movie at least 4 times, so that you get familiarized with the music."
5,Info on how to get the complete score and soundtrack,"If you would like to get the FULL, COMPLETE score and soundtrack to this film, I can help you out. I have information on how to get a 2 CD set that contains ALL of the music that appears in the film, in the ORDER it appears in the film. This is NOT the Til All Are One set offerred at the official convention - this is BETTER. It also comes with a third disc of Stan Bush and Transformer related tracks. All for one low price. Don't delay! E-mail me at flashback@somewhereintime.com, and I'll fill you in on all of the details. Trust me - you will be glad you did."
5,"Great CD, Perfect for any Transformers fan...","Excellent CD, although a few songs are missing from the movie. Even with that this is one of the best movie CD's out there. ""The Touch"" is the best song on the CD period! Brings back a lot of memories from the movie!"
4,The perfect music album for the tried and true TransFan!,"I have always loved this soundtrack, back when i first had it on tape, and of course, Kid Rhino re-released the movie last year, to my ultimate amazement. I used to collect the toys back in the '80's, I've seen almost all the episodes of the TV series, and now I am searching the Net in order to locate the Limited Edition double album ""Till All Are One"", at first only available at BotCon '97, the annual fan convention. Wish me luck, people! Anyway, the music included on this CD are incredibly terrific, the two Stan Bush songs are really fantastic, the three Vince Dicola score tunes are very moving and soothing at times. The '80's rock ballads from now-unknown bands are all right as well, my favorite being Lion's Theme song from the beginning and the end. However, Weird Al's ""Dare To Be Stupid"" is a little, well, I should say, silly for this soundtrack. Anyway, I would recommended this album heavily, it's just what the TransFans ordered!"
4,A Great Soundtrack,"I saw Transformers the Movie when I was a kid, and the music was one of the first impressions that stuck on me by the end. In fact, I'm listening to it right now as I write this. I know the songs are done by nobodys, but they are good, solid songs with very good lyrics.They are also all in the movie, not like some current movie soundtracks. I especially like Vince DiCola's instrumental work, with is sad that there is less of his music on it. I heard that on botcon.com there is a 2 CD set with previously unreleased music from the movie.I hope you'll enjoy it as much this soundtrack as much as I have.Cheers!"
2,For nosalgia purposes only.,"Transformers fans will no doubt love it for nostalgia, but it's not that great. Really.Stan Bush was/is certainly better than most pop musicians of his type, but still grates - his powerful voice is let down by some embarrassingly naive lyrics. The metal tracks by B-list bands are cheesy beyond belief, reminiscent of several pastiches. The music highlights have to be Vince DiCola'a storming instrumentals, with incredible bass-lines. Only they save the album from being just another bog-standard cartoon Movie CD.If you love/enjoy the film, get it. Otherwise, you won't really care."
3,Nitty-Gritty,"Here's a highly textured down and dirty look at the urban world through the eyes of Ralph Bakshi. Though this piece is a fine companion to the Bakshi work ""Fritz The Cat"" it doesn't hold a candle to his magnum opus ""WIZARDS"". Still, it's about as slice-of-life as Ralph gets. If you like Bakshi, you'll find this to be a must for your collection."
2,Not because it's offensive...,"Like Bakshi's other works (except for Lord of the Rings, which I happen to like) it is well-animated and the rest is terrible. The fact that I say this has nothing to do with the fact that it is offensive, and I get irritated when reviewers imply that the ""mainstream/establishment"" critics just can't handle Bakshi's subversive filmaking."
4,Not your average cartoon!,"This movie is strange. I love the animation especially from the 1970s ERA. This movie is hillarious. Don't expect to know what's going on. This isnt about the life of some celebrity. The Writer had just drew something up off his mind and posted on the big screen. And Yes, it's funny."
5,Another Great Fritz the Cat Movie,"If you've seen the movie Fritz The Cat and wish there was more, you're in luck. This movie picks up where Fritz The Cat ends. Excellent adult cartoon, with the same ""Fritz"" humor. I highly recommend this movie."
1,the world is a vampire,No level of animation can make up for the depravity of spirit in this film. Yes -- the world is a harsh reality.BUT - the heart is an impenetrable redemption. Please take notice.This movie has no redemption. This movie has no heart.Pitiful. Pathetic. Ugly. Stupid. With an occasional glimpse of artistic merit.and the real life scenes are some of the most uncomfortable acting i've seen to date. watcher beware!
2,2-1/2 stars -- Maybe I came in late,"This part-live action, part-animated movie from 1973 seemed to get rave reviews, and I was up late one night, so I decided to check it out. But I'm sorry; I just didn't get this movie. I did understand that the main character, Michael, had a hard life and some very dysfunctional (divorced) parents. But then the movie got all twisted. By watching the movie, you can tell that was sort of the point, but it was still weird in that a lot of the scenes and secondary characters didn't seem to have anything to do with each other. Also, the ""n"" word was thrown around a lot, but I guess I can let that side since it was the `70s. Maybe you have to be drunk to understand this movie or something.Anthony Rupert"
4,"unpleasant, but not bad","Watching Ralph Bakshi is something of a guilty pleasure. You always get the feeling that things could be a whole lot better, and yet no one else ever seems to bring animation to life with such a personal style. Heavy Traffic has a lot of faults, and may also be the best thing he's ever done (though I know there are a lot of Wizard and even Ring fans out there). Not for everyone, but fairly entertaining in its own troubled way."
2,Are you a gambler?,My Burmese rag doll cat did not like this at all. So buy this if you want to roll the dice. Every cat has his/her own finicky likes/dislikes. The odor can be a bit off-putting for more sensitive breeds.
2,I really wanted to like this!,"I really wanted an alternative to flea and tic medication and I had heard great things about garlic tablets, but after a month I have seen only minimal results. I have a Greman Sheppard and a Malmute, I gave them 4 tabs per 10 lbs a day for a month, and they were both still itchy after the 1000 tabs ran out. I will say that I noticed LESS fleas and itching, but not what I was expecting. Try it out though! apparantly it works for other people, and I may still use it to ward off mosquitoes and heartworm during summer months!"
2,"It's Okay, But Does Absolutely Nothing For Fleas","Day 4 of giving our dogs some tablets. They are scratching from fleas more than ever.The product probably has some benefits, but it does absolutely nothing as a flea repellent."
5,The key to understanding violence in schools and society!,"As a scholar who has spent the last 3 years trying to understand what drives men (and now boys) to the extremes that we have witnessed at the Dunblane (Scotland) Elementary School - 19 dead, (March, 1996), the Port Arthur (Tasmania) Historic Site - 35 dead (April 1996), on through a litany of American towns right up to the Columbine High School in Littleton, CO in April 99, I have found the greatest insight into these actions in Gilligan's book. He asserts that at the root of the worst violence, indeed all violence, is shame. I concur. This book must be required for parents, teachers, psychologists, anyone concerned with the roots of violence. Guns provide the means (the British and Australians were wise enough to legislate gun controls after their respective disasters), shame is the driving force behind each of the cases of horror we witness all too frequently!"
5,Great,"Very interesting read, I found his theory of violence convincing. Although like others I don't think Gilligan claimed that shame was the only cause of violence and always led to violence. His explanation of structural and behavioral violence was well put in that structural violence is often the cause of behavioral violence, but because structural violence is indirect, its effects are unknown to most people. As a result most people a quick to jump the gun and see the violent offenders directly responsible and the cause of their behavior, and often using the religious notion of evil. Gilligan Does a god job of linking these issues to the route of the problem which is the structure of the system itself."
4,Very Interesting Theories,I didn't agree with all the theories presented in this work but they were all well thought out and explained.
2,It was repitious and boring.,The book has good points but unfortunantly it was very repitious. This entire book could have been finished in 2 chapters.
4,Every Black home should have a copy,"I too, ran across this program quite by accident and I was riveted until the last credit. Mr. Smiley and company really captured the mission of the trip, the history of the mission and the oh so lively debates. I plan on buying a copy for all of the strong, good, black men in my life. They should know about this DVD"
1,Poorly Designed Door,"This door is poorly designed. When I installed it and tried to open the door, half of the panels turn and half go straigth. Does not look like picture of door. Instruction are very very poor and lack a lot of detail. I called customer service, who made me feel like they could careless about my problems and basically said the door was my problem. Don't waste your money on this door!"
5,Scholar's Ink,"In a deceptively slender book, Roc the Mic addresses weighty and rarely-discussed linguistic aspects of hip hop culture. I've marked up countless pages as I read through the book, bookmarking pages here and there for future reference. It's a superb resource, particularly for those who want to understand and closely examine the language of the most vibrant cultural phenomenon of our current times. Using meticulous linguistic analyses, interviews with artists, case study, and more...Alim uses every strategy at his disposal to define, explain, and even debate thick socio-political, pedagogical, and identity dynamics framed by hip hop language. While some readers might find some views and explications verging on the controversial, in the end, Roc the Mic establishes itself as a foundational volume for serious hip hop linguistic scholarship. If that weren't enough, it also provides room for inquiry questions to develop, thus paving the way for future research. Real talk!"
3,toadsticker,"Buck Short Revolution - If the blade folds into the handle... it is NOT a ""fixed blade"" knife.Fixed Blade Knives don't have a pivot."
5,Conway at his best; all tracks are original studio quality.,"I've been listening to Conway Twitty for some 30 years and this CD has the best coverage of his hit songs that I have seen on any one recording release. If you desire Conway T or just good Country Ballads on a continuous hit packed CD, then you won't go wrong adding this to your collection."
5,Conway Twitty CD,We finally wore out the this CD that we had for years. It was a favorite and even got our granddaughter hooked on it. I'm so glad I could find a replacement for the one we had and one for the granddaughter for Christmas.
3,"""LESS THAN COULD BE""","There is nothing really wrong with this cd, but I have heard better as far as sound and songs, but this is just personal opinion. It has some of his most popular songs, but I feel some of the best were left out.I bought it for one song I had been wanting. For someone who wants just a general sampling of his work, it is fine."
5,Don't Miss The Legacy!,"In death, Tammy Wynette escaped the emotional and physical torment that had shadowed her for most of her adult life. It was then that her true legacy was revealed: her music. This CD offers up some of Wynette's biggest and best hits. If your only exposure to country music's First Lady is STAND BY YOUR MAN, then listen to these other number one songs and you will be engulfed in a sound that will chill you, excite you and leave you in awe. These sixteen tracks prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Tammy Wynette is one of the greatest country female vocalists of all time."
1,Dreadful...save your money,Catholic bashing by an uninformed disciple of Lorraine Boetner; kind of like a Jack Chick tract without the cartoons. If you want to understand Catholicism you'd be better served by buying a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
1,Read pros before cons,"It's people like this that get on my nerves. People that get information COMPLETELY wrong and mock it. For example, a Priest does not forgive you of your sins. He prepares you for your confession to GOD and the rest of your peers. If you want information from a different point of view, research the religion first, like reading a Catholic Bible! Then read the Torah and the book of Mormon, NOT books that establish, in the end, a confusing and misunderstood conclusion. Read the pros before the cons. I dislike this book."
1,Better Title: 10 Ignorant Things to Say to a Catholic,"If you are looking to ""be more informed about their (Catholic's) beliefs"" this definitly is not the book you are looking for. If on the other hand, you want to appear totally ignorant of Catholic beliefs this is a great book! What you will get is Rhodes misrepresentation of what Catholic's believe, complete with Ron's personal interpretation of select scripture, his revision of history and outright lies."
1,enough,"Rehashed B.S. We've heard it time and time again. Mind your own business, stop trying to ""save"" us with your pathetic shallow reasoning. The agenda is laughable, given the ""distinguished"" ancient history of the authors' Church. :-) Do what Saint Paul recommends and work out your own salvation and stop insulting readers intelligence due to the authors lack of the same. And as a favor to the author and the like minded, just stay away from me and similar minded Catholics. We might not react in a proper Christian manner to your offense."
1,Maybe if one looked at the other side...,"Perhaps if one addressed Catholicism as another option and looked at, truthfully looked at, the biblical support behind Catholicism and did not approach it immediately trying to discredit it, one would find that Catholicism is really the way to go.It's too bad nobody does."
2,Trouble with universal claims...,"I read through the chapter of this book on the ""Apocrypha"" and I was able to see a few points the author made against various Catholic arguments that the Apocrypha is Scripture. However, the author had trouble when he began making his own arguments against the Apocrypha. As far as I could tell, his arguments could not become universal claims. One of the main difficulties was he used the word ""some"" when describing evidence, which cannot become a universal claim. Also, when I looked at the New Testament citations he gave, I had trouble always seeing his point when I placed the quote in a larger context.The book is easy to read though, and if it is religious material, I tend to enjoy reading it regardless of the content because I feel that learning other people's perspectives is always a beneficial thing."
3,Fobus,"Great material - hard polymer/plastic like mold that makes it durable. Gun fits very snug but still allows it to draw easily. The downfall is that on this particular model (belt holster) not the paddle, the belt loop opening is very small and does not fit most of my belts. I have to use a slimmer belt. If I had the chance I would have picked the paddle!"
1,Not even close to what I ordered,"I wanted a paddle holster, the description even says, rubberized paddle, I got a belt holster, it doesn't even look like the one in the picture. The belt loops are too small for any belt I own so I can't even use it if I wanted to."
4,haitian voodoo practices and history,Book is well written and informative for a pocket size book. Great photos of two Denis Smith paintings as well as other paintings. Gives you documents passed in the early 1800s on slavery which are very interesting.
2,"Itchy and Annoying, Not Worth The Hype","I bought two of these early in pregnancy, thinking I'd get to keep wearing my pre-pregnancy jeans longer. Needless to say, I was disappointed. It was the end of summer and the last thing I wanted was another snug layer of itchy fabric next to my skin. I used it folded in half because it was WAY too wide, but the thing kept riding up and irritating me, and needed readjusting every time I used the restroom. I would much rather wear maternity pants than try to use this band to keep wearing my pre-pregnancy pants longer! Now that I have two of these, I'm hoping they can be used for postpartum support so they won't be a total waste of money."
4,bella band,I was very happy with the bella band. I am almost five month along and I am still wearing my jeans from before. The only thing I did not like is it always feels like you have to pull up your pants because until you are really big the band may be be a little loose. I suggest until you are bigger to use a hair tie to close the button of your jeans and use the band it helps keep your pants up a little better. BUT it is well worth the money.
4,Great purchase!,Great product for when you are in the in between stage of pregnancy. I can still wear my pants just with the zipper open!
3,"Have we been ""had""?","I've never written a book review in my life, but I couldn't resist with this one. It was given to me by a friend who was intrigued by the title. It's a quick read, but by the middle it became like slogging through mud. If it had been longer, I would have stopped reading and written it off. I also fully expected the last paragraph to say something along the lines of, ""Congratulations! You have now spent money on, read, and thought seriously about a professional work of BS"".This little essay had some good points and thoughts that made me laugh in reference to the political scene, and a story about a father telling his son that it was never necessary to lie if you could BS your way through something. Still,in the end I was left wondering whether the author had written a serious essay or whether the entire point was to expect his audience to just ""get"" the fact that they'd just been BS'd by a pro! Read it in this light and see what you think."
2,"Drop ""On"" from the title","I'm sorry to leave a poor review, under the pretext of; ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.""I felt this book was a show of Mr. Frankfurt's own intelligence. He is truly a wise man, however, skirts the topic of his book and never really points to the 'Bullsh*t'. I find that at the end of the book, the reader is just made aware of the abundance of BS in the world, and is not left with any means to regard it.Basically; this is book is so short because it doesn't cover anything."
1,A life-changing work---Five Star Review,"The rewards of reading and re-reading this small, sure-to-be-a-classic volume are limitless. When one grasps Professor Frankfurt's thesis, one's life is changed forever. While a very funny book, it is not a joke book or anything to be taken lightly. It reflects serious analysis of a subject that we all think we know but don't really. The last sentence of the book says it all.Upon reading my review on-line, I realized that I had hit the wrong button and given this book only one star when I meant to give it five and so I am now attempting to correct it...and that's no BS."
3,This book is BS!,"The author never gets around to telling us what BS is, other then to say that it is not a lie or lying. This is not even really a book. It is very small with very few pages and very little writting on each page. But my 7 year old son went wild when he saw the title. So it does have some amusement value as it is a nice looking cover. But don't expect any great insights if you do read it. His appeal to authority by talking about famous authors is perhaps the greatest degree of BS there is. Because even in that he does not say anything of any substance."
2,much ado about nothing,"Must confess I have not listened to all of the audio tape-- do not recommend it. It's probably better as a book. As a ""book on tape"", it's far too word and pompous. Reader drones on and on. Not at all enjoyable to listen to as you drive along. Held my interest for about 5 minutes."
4,Compact and philosophical,The book has subtle overtures of philosophy and intellectual humor. It is compact and I have read it twice as it requires an indepth study to comrehend its true meaning. Made me laugh and reflect at the same time. The author could be less cynical. Wish the book was longer.
4,A Liar's Paradox,"An American version of the Liar's paradox but with other nuances, this tiny philosophical tome is worthy of the Western Canon of Philosophy. It is worth reading. Critically speaking, however, much of the connotation and denotation of the word analyzed within this book is lost within the philosophical logic. The word under consideration is used often in the American West, but all of the rugged ranch humor associated with that word is lost within a philosophical dissection of the word's etymology. That said, the logically twisted arguments presented in this book create a paradoxical gift for the reader. Within the book, hidden between the lines, there is a fun and challenging puzzle; And it is veiled in a joke."
3,Perfect Title,"During my reading of this essay, it became apparent that the author's intent was to bull--- the reader. To do this, he literally polishes a turd as his way of bull----ing the reader.If your intent in reading this essay is to get an understanding of bull---, forget it. If your intent is to be entertained by a very clever essayist read it."
2,From Lowbrow to Nobrow,"I was quite disappointed to find this ""book""--pamphlet-sized, large fonts spreading out over sixty plus pages, roughly a paragraph per page--living up to its title. It is really no more than a glorified lecture from an established philosopher who, it would seem, has become big enough to pull a con job on his readers. In the end, Frankfurt takes all this time to reach the conclusion that BS is different from lying, in my opinion hardly worth the paper it's printed on. All in all, an inconsequential and not very entertaining analytical exercise by an emeritus academic with too much time on his hands. If you want to read a work that lives up to being called ""entertaining"" and ""enlightening"" you could try ""From Lowbrow to Nobrow"" (2006)."
3,The Title Says Everything,"Frankfurt thoroughly explores the world of male bovine excrement (hereafter MBE) in an erudite, articulate manner. What is it? Why is there so much of it? How does it resemble, yet differ from, lying? The book is not only erudite and articulate, it is succinct, short, and small. I found the size/price ratio somewhat disconcerting.Frankfurt, for all his study, fails to discern the origin of the term MBE. The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that the term ""bull"" comes from the old French word ""boule,"" meaning fraud, deceit, trickery, or foolishness. Thus ""bull"" is the correct term and ""bull****"" is a scatalogical intensifier.Frankfurt misses another point. MBE is most certainly hot air spouted without regard for accuracy. I submit that scholarly discourse on trivialities is also MBE. For example, Frankfurt's book -- or this review."
4,OK< here's the BS conundrum...,"Yes, this is a worthy topic to explore. We swim in a sea of BS every day, and it's nice to know what we might gulp every few strokes.But the Fountain of BS -- that font from which most toro caca spews -- is generally the kind of stuff you read on book jackets! Oh well, nobody knows BS like a BSer!Seriously, this book is worth your investment as a social study and for cultural literacy. Hey, it's only $8.96! But the look on your pastor's face when you bring it to read in church... priceless."
2,"Thin, and Lacking Academic Depth or Insight","I was really disappointed in this ""book,"" which is basically just a pretentiously-written, long-winded few paragraphs on semantics, not philosophy. It is hardly academic, and offered no valuable insights. Whoever decided to publish this is a genius, however. Great marketing. The best thing I can say about this piece is that it's the best example there is of BS, which I guess basically helps prove its one lone point: we're all suckers."
1,Practicing what is explored,"This book is BS.It reads like a smart-aleck college freshman who wrote a high ""word quota"" paper the night before it was due.Guess I was hoping for and expecting something more along the lines of ""The art of..."" and came away horribly unimpressed.A waste of 45 minutes and five bucks."
1,Does not worth the time to read.,"The writing is excellent regarding the language used. The content is poor and uninteresting. If you want to know how the author defines the word, then read it, otherwise go on with your life, do not waste time."
1,How could the NY Times do this to me?,"I bought this book after reading its review in The New York Times. Although the book is only 50-something pages, it is filled with bullsh*t of its own. Frankfurt, a philosopher, attempts to understand bullsh*t, humbug and other BS descriptors from a theoretical standpoint and it doesn't work. If you have trouble sleeping, forget the Ambien...read this and you'll be asleep in no time."
1,If you have too much time on your hands,"This book is thoughouly definitive of its title. The entire book could be sumed up in a few paragraphs but this writer found it useful to waste both his time and his readers time by writing the most long winded definition of a term that has ever been documented. If you find this book for less than two dollars on a used book stand and bring it home to read on a night that you just cannot fall asleep, then you've still spent a dollar seventy five too much."
5,This Book is a Bargain,"What's the difference between a lie and ""bs""?The author suggests that a liar is someone who is consciously opposed to the truth, whereas a bs-er is someone who is indifferent to the truth.The author also suggests that being indifferent to the truth could be worse than being opposed to the truth.The reasoning used to derive his thoughts and conclusions are good examples of clear, articulate thinking.So, this book has value on a couple of levels: the conclusion itself and the process by which the conclusion is achieved.The book is short - only 65 pages or so. It's an easy, entertaining and worthwhile read.We become more enlightened both directly (by the author's statements of his conclusions) and indirectly (by experiencing the analystical process and its clarity) by reading something like this.This book is a bargain."
5,Wonderful!,"Harry Frankfurt, On Bullxxxx (Princeton University Press, 2005)I really can't say much about this small, slim volume (in order to get a magazine article to be sixty-seven pages, they made the book smaller than a mass market paperback and enlarged the type slightly) other than ""brilliant."" This is absolutely wonderful stuff; it's the rarest of philosophical treatises that will actually get a laugh out of you. This one will, and more than once. It's already a cult classic, having sold over three hundred thousand copies in just its first few months of release; I'll just add my voice to the many who have already given this book the high praise it deserves. You want a copy, and you want it now. ****"
5,awesome,"This book is original and insightful; a short but challenging read that provides logic, depth, and enlightenment to a topic that we all believe we know so well. This is philosophy; not science. Genius."
5,Hillarious!,"A marvelous book written on subject familiar to all. More books examining, philosophically, ordinary aspects of life are needed."
1,Academic Elitism At Its Worst,"This book, beside being boring is superficial, and a bit presumptuous. There could have been a more meaningful treatise on the concept of spin, political correctness, and corporate and educational jargon, and many of the ironies of modern life which go well beyond mere deception. Instead, we get a tome significant only for being so ponderous despite being so small.If the book were not so titled, no one would have bought it."
1,On Bulls**t IS Bulls**t,"This ""book"" amounts to nothing more than a hardcover bounded essay. Speaking in terms of text alone, more substance can be found in any feature article of Newsweek. Speaking in terms of interesting thought, more substance can be found in any feature article of Maxim. This little treatise contributes nothing in terms of intellectual stimulation other than begging the questions: 1) How did this guy convince someone to publish this? and 2) How has he not starved to death for lack of anything valuable to contribute to society?"
1,Why?,"Why was this book written? It could only exist post-Clinton. In a world where we say, ""It depends on what the meaning of 'is' is."" This book is a bunch of double-speak and useless quotations.This book has no beginning, no ending, and a weak middle. One may notice that most glowing reviews include the big positive that it is so short. The author could have done one better by writing his essay on a napkin in crayon.At least ""It depends on what the meaning of 'is' is"" is funny. I kept waiting for a reason why this book was written. It is not funny, it is not informative, the conclusion tells one nothing, it is not controversial, and it is not interesting. It is short. Whoopee!"
1,An excercise in BS...,"Actually, this entire book is an excercise in BS. It seems funny to me that the very author who claims that BS intends to make its emitter look good cannot see that this is exactly what HE is doing HIMSELF. Unbelievable!!!The whole tiny little essay is a pompous, blowhard attempt at explaining BS. I actually thought this clown was going to go into the ramifications of BS in our world. Instead, all I got was one bag of hot air after another of what BS is. I would tend to think that if a reader is actually buying a book on BS, he already knows full well what it is!!! Goodness gracious. This guy's got way too much Ivy League blood running through his veins...and that's no BS, baby!!!"
1,Verbose,Using big words is the first sign of a bs'er trying to get their point across. Not much there but an extended definition of a word that has heretofore gone undefined.
1,Title sells the book ...,The book definitely reads like a college thesis and severely lacks any original or entertaining thoughts. Save your money.
4,Good read,"An introduction to valuable concept of how much bs people and ourselves spread , how much we talk about things we don't know about and the importance of understanding this, accept it but with full awareness"
5,"It's obvious, but someone needs to say it.","This book is obvious, in a sense. Everyone knows -- more or less -- what bullshit is. But until you read the book, you probably haven't thought about it. It's a brilliant, short book on practical philosophy. Practical, because most of what we hear is bullshit, and you need to be able to respond to it."
3,Short but Cute,"Extremely short, but it's good for a laugh when seen on my desk, and the (very dry) treatise inside is amusing for a first readthrough."
5,Just Good Fun - A Hoot,"For those folks in your life who are not heavy readers, this little book will put a smile on their face and might even cause them to pick up another book ... just for fun.Searching for the truth can be fun.Thanks Harry"
3,Not ground breaking,"This is a good book. It does a good job of describing how to detect critical flaws in arguments, with a focus on theism. It is well written, cogent and logical, especially if you don't believe in God. What it does not do is break new ground. The positions it argues one must take when dealing with theistic arguments have been written about before, and extensively. Mr. Law does do a good job of bringing some of these together. But he doesn't break any ground regarding beliefs and how to overcome them. That is a separate problem. The book does read well, but by itself, will soon be forgotten.CJS"
1,a definition of the title,This guy just keeps defining the word! I was expecting more on how our world is full of it.
3,One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much,"... of the substance that HGF writes a whole book, within limits, about, but that we poor Amazon reviewers are not allowed to use.Within limits, because the book is so short, that a full quotation (minus the word, of course) could count as a rather long review. That is so, because the book is entirely self-reflective, it writes about itself. It moves in perfect circles and ignores all limits of seriousness and keeps this righteous attitude throughout. I love it.The most remarkable achievement is that it manages to charge 10 bucks for itself, plus transportation charges, the latter amounting, in case of a single book parcel to China, to a quite unproportional amount of money and weight/volume of packing material. One could say, the book duplicates its contents via viral infections in Amazon charges and packing material.Does this count as non-sexual replication? Or am I talking something that must remain unnamed?"
4,Surprising,"This short little book on a subject little thought of in intellectual circles provided a surprising amount of inspiration. This book is a fascinating journey into the meaning of truth, lies and BS. It was surprisingly thoughtful and like anything thoughtful it fertilized more thought. At least for me it did. I think it was worth the investment in money and time."
3,Cumbersome,"This essay is educational but not engaging. I hesitate to level this criticism at such a ""renowned moral philosopher,"" but I feel slighted for paying ten dollars for what I (incorrectly) assumed would at least be somewhat witty. Frankfurt does parse meanings with great care, but his academic style of writing is nothing if not cumbersome. He ultimately leads the reader to a better understanding of b***s***, distinguishing it from lying and a genuine concern for the truth. For that insight, though, I should have just borrowed the book from the library."
3,shaggy dog story,"This is a pretty funny book, essentially one long shaggy dog sort of joke. It's a joke, son. Makes fun of academics and others who can make a dissertation out of a molehill. Whether you want to spend this much money on a single joke is perhaps a pertinent question. I enjoyed reading it, and re-sold my copy on Amazon so it wasn't a total loss."
5,Important book!,"This book is a wonderful and timely read. It's very short, but decidedly written in acadmemic prose. Don't let this put you off, though. It is very funny, although I don't think it intends to be.It made me think hard about the messages we receive everyday from those in power. Much of what I used to think were lies, I now think are bull****. And bull**** is much, much more dangerous."
4,No BS,"ON BS is the smallest book I've ever read (it takes about an hour to finish). I was interested in Frankfurt's analysis of the difference between liars and BS artists, and his argument that lies are less of an affront to the truth than BS is. This last point seems counterintuitive, and might be contradicted by his earlier observation about how people will shrug off BS but sustain a real hurt because of a lie. But there is plenty of fodder for thought and further exploration, and Frankfurt is to be commended for his crystalline, intelligent style and for tackling a subject that seems to have been ignored, despite the fact that we are nearly drowning in it."
2,Appropriately Titled.,"This is what you get when you have a philosopher, other than a backwoods philosopher or a Good Ole Boy Philosopher, talk about this subject....(See Title, leaving out ""On))Some kernals of corn here, but not worth the effort in working through the rest of the ""stuff"" to find them.This gentleman didn't have a whole lot to do when he wrote this book!!!"
4,Worth Reading,"This is a wake up and take note kind of read. Should be required reading for Congressmen and Senators. Read this book in conjunction with How to Manage Your D.I.C.K: Redirect Sexual Energy and Discover Your More Spiritually Enlightened, Evolved Self. These two books will help you to wake up and smell the you-know-what."
1,Booooorring,"Unfortunately, I thought the book would be a lot better than it turned out to be. Oh dear."
1,A waste of money,"I had heard interesting reviews of this book. What a crock of you know what!Frankfurt proves that if you put a provocative title on a book and talk about Bull**t somebody will be stupid enough to buy it. Glad I got it on sale.... I only blew $6.99 - but that was still over $1.00 a page...Incidentally, I only gave it a 1 because there was no way to give it a Zero."
3,No s***!,Books is fine way to got international influences. This way of thinking is not dead in this 12 digital world! It is true.
5,Interesting on many levels,"This ""Essay in Book's Clothing"" can be appreciated on three levels.1 - At the surface, it's a pedantic description of the subject. What is bull****? What isn't? Why? How does it differ from lying?2 - At a secondary level, one might interpret the whole essay as bull****ing on bull****. I suspect this was not intended as the purpose of the essay, but it is an interpretation.3 - If you take it seriously, the essay is an attack on cultural reletavism - the idea that truth is not objective. The author attacks bull****ters not because they lie, but that they have a complete disregard for the truth. At least liars respect the truth enough to be false. The bull**** artist does not care one way or the other.It's a bit wordy in getting the point across (strange for a 67 page book!) but still worth reading. It won't take long to understand it - honest!"
4,Good Fun,"My kids and I love this movie. No, it's not sophisticated, and I'm usually not a fan of kids' booger humor, but that's a small part of the story. There are just so many random, eccentric kid characters, everyone can really relate to at least one. Everyone has wanted a wishing rock at some point, and yet we all know it would actually be disastrous, even for grown-ups making wishes."
2,"""Shorts"" is a colorful over-the-top trip into a child's world, but way too much for me","Length:: 3:02 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie ""Shorts"", written and directed by Robert Rodriguez.[...]"
3,It is interesting,"It is not as good as many other children's movies, but an interesting family show. It is mostly a kid's movie."
2,Ehh...,"It's a pretty good movie. My five year old brothers like it, but I got bored so I'll give it two stars."
1,Acetal Ball Grade 1,"I needed an acetal ball that was 1.25 inch in diameter. don't read too fast because Acetal Ball Grade 1 .25 inch in diameter is really a ball that is 0.25 inch in diameter....not 1.25 inches.BUT ...amazon.com came through and I got my money back and it only cost me $0.44 because 0.25 inch Acetal balls only weigh about half an ounce.No harm, no foul!"
1,Half the pages were missing,This book might be useful if it arrived complete - my book started at page 17 which means the most relevant (for me) G tuning sections were missing. Now trying to get a replacement or refund from Amazon but it isn't proving easy as the booklet was bundled with another product.
4,Helpful reference!,"Fits right in the banjo case, easy read and reference. Smelled like an old library so has probably been sitting somewhere for some time but the price was right so will live with it."
3,Just like the name says ...,"Fits banjo case and has more chords than you'll ever need to know. Arranged in a logical order - as in chords are listed in Keys, not alphabetically. A must have accessory."
3,Very handy to have,This is great to refer to when you don't want something too bulky sitting in your banjo case.
2,"Nice book, bad binding","Just received this book today. It looks as useful as other reviewers have said, BUT the binding is awful. I tried to open the book out flat and pages immediately started falling out! Publisher, please print an edition with a spiral binding!"
5,Bluegrass Drem,"I love this chord book. Whether i'm just picking or playing a song, every chord i'll ever need is within these few pages. really handy to have around. and at just a few dollars, worth it."
3,Difficult to Use While Playing,"Like others have said, the binding makes it difficult to have it lay open without holding it. It also doesn't fit in my case, but I won't take off any stars for that considering they have the product dimensions on Amazon. The info inside is great and very helpful to anyone looking to start playing banjo."
5,A must-have for understanding cultural perceptions of time.,"This book blew my mind back when it was first released, and on third or fourth read, there is still so much information to be gleaned from it.Issues discussed:Appointments by time vs. being late because a friend in need is more important.Queueing for the bus vs. pushing and shoving to the front of the line.Needing closure vs. pigeon-holing a half-completed but unimportant task, often for months or even years.But most importantly, the book goes in great detail into how these cultural differences in the perception of time and sequence affect interactions between the races and between nations. I highly recommend Dance of Life not only for international travellers but also for anyone who has to deal with other cultures."
5,Fascinating journey for the mind and soul,"Seldom do we closely question our cultural notion of time.Hall gives clear explanations of how time is structured in othernon-Western world cultures. The idea for example that we have of daysand hours being empty boxes to be filled with our accomplishmentscontrasts sharply with content-filled time, whereexperiencing what natural cycles like seasons offer is central.Put another way, as JosephCampbell used to say, ""Is life a problem to be solved, or a mystery to belived?' Personally I'll go with the mystery, and I think Hall will too."
1,"Excellent book, very poor print quality","The book is excellent, as most of the works of Edward T. Hall are. For anyone trying to understand the clash of cultures, either from a business perspective or a psycho - social one, the concepts of monochronic and polychronic time are most valuable. However, I was really disappointed by the very, very poor quality of print. Bad mark for Amazon from this point of view. Delivery ok."
3,"Good memory, but bad service","I ordered this product on 12/13. It is now 12/27 and I have not received it yet. The only reason I can say ""good memory"" is that I've used Kingston in the past and have had no problems. If you need memory quick, find another way to order. Crucial.com has always been good to me."
3,Nice,The bulldog detail was nice but was alittle big for my taste. The part were the chain goes through is huge!!! did not look right with a silver chain unles you like some thing really large but I did find a black cord rope chain which i thought looked great.
3,"The Good, Bad and Ugly","Mr. Miller's book is well written and extremely interesting when he sticks to the carrier and its personnel. That's the good part. The Bad part is when he puts in a large plug for Hannity, Limbaugh, Fox News et al. He should stick to the carrier information, I really don't care to read his right wing garbage.The Ugly part is when he decries the ""politically connected contractors"" getting contracts for Boston's Big Dig project. Of course, Boston is left wing, hence the poke at them. He, of course, does not mention Haliburton's no-bid contracts in Iraq.I still recommend the book based on the vivid description of the carrier and life aboard it. You can skip his political junk and just concentrate on the riveting carrier stuff."
1,"Dumb, not well researched book.","This author did not spend enough time to know anything about anything on this ship or in the War. I spent 2 1/2 years of my life (sea time) on this ship and this guy has only biased preconceived ideas. I made three tours to the Gulf & I can tell you this guy is full of crap. His pathetic 2 weeks on boat ( most likely in a cushy stater room no doubt) gives him just enough credibility to write a book. He was not 'embedded' in anything like the other know-nothing reviewers pointed out. 2 weeks in the officers mess and smoking pits on a ship is nothing. He took a fun trip, he was not embedded. He is a civilian journalist who was on the boat for 2 weeks and spent half of that time with the officers and the other half on the smoking sponson. He paints a weird picture of the enlisted and makes their jobs seem minimal, like they had no training."
4,Tight fit,"Bought this for my Sig Sauer sp2022, it is a really tight fit, will need some work but Im happy with it."
5,Well Made Mag Pouch,Purchased this Fobus 9MM Single Mag Pouch for my Taurus PT-111. Fits the mag very well and does not come out while moving around. Seems like it is made very well and will serve my needs well. Buy one you will like it. :)
3,Not the worst purchase,"Honestly, It's a nice durable construction and holds my mags very well... but that's my issue, it holds them too well. I guess if I was base jumping or skydiving or climbing a mountain I would want my magazine to be THAT snug, but for the tactical application for which I'm using it I cannot retrieve my mag out of the holster fast enough. It's just too tight. Great for confidently carrying extra mags on your person without worry of it falling out during unkown circumstances tho."
3,Doesn't fit Glock 19 Mags...,"Stated in the description (hopefully they've changed this) that this mag holder fit Glock double-stack (9mm) mags...Nope...Promptly returned.The description also stated that the paddle was ""rubberized""...Nope...Just plastic."
5,Read this and you'll want to make the trip,"I bought this book after hearing a great review on NPR, thinking I had no real plans to travel the Blues Highway. But when you read it you can almost hear the music and you can practically see those juke joints and crossroads! Buy this book and you'll want to go!"
2,blues highway,"book arrived in good condition. I enjoyed reading it, and then I gave it to my wife. she cound not put it down. Great novel - - - great author."
1,Dark Poetry,Why bother to write poems that are so dark and sometimes mean? I discarded the book before finishing.
1,Mouth guard case,"Horrible service, didn't get what i ordered, the order said I would receive a mouth guard case and the picture clarified that. Instead, I got a mouth guard in the mail and I told the company I wanted the mouth guard case. So naturally they send me ANOTHER MOUTH GUARD."
5,mouthguard case,I bought 2 of these and they work like a charm I'm glad I got them.Would be great for football & boxing.
2,chips were too old,"I love terra taro chips, i usually buy them from whole foods. this time i decided to purchase them online but was dissapointed. the terro chips i purchased were OLD! I wont do that again!"
3,I prefer the regular taro chips.,"The spiced ones are thankfully not thickly coated like Doritos Ranch or overly hot like Andy Capp's fried starch sticks. But they will irritate your already sore throat and I wouldn't buy these again. These do still have that HARD crunch of the original terra chips which is why I bought these in the first place. Since they are a tougher tuber, they don't taste as fried as the others in the assortment bag.Also, 12 bags is way too much. This was not a smart bulk purchase for me. The experience did deter me from buying a bulk case of my absolute favorite crunchy munchies (Snyder of Hanover honey mustard PIECES)."
1,Good Product - Bad Packing,"I have been buying the Spiced Taro Chips for a few years locally. Since they can be hard to get at times, I thought it would be great to be able to order some from Amazon. The package came on time, but the bags were not padded in the box at all. Only 5 of the 12 packages arrived as they should. The other 7 bags burst open durning shipping and spilled out into the box. This attracted ROACHES from somewhere along the shipping route, which promptly ecsaped into my house when we opened the box. To add to this, the receipt in the box said ""Returns Are Easy!"" Not on this order - tried to print up the return form and was informed that this was not a returnable product."
3,You can do better!,"Terra Chips really mess up Taro Chips. Actually all of their chips are usually over baked and burnt, broken up, and unevenly seasoned, bordering on bland. Do yourself a favor and try Hawaiichips.com! I just had my first serving of their taro chips. They are light, thinly sliced, evenly seasoned, and absolutely excellent! Not one burnt chip in the bag. Head and shoulders above Terra. What's more they come from Hawaii and are still cheaper than Terra. I promise you I am not affiliated with the company... just a staunch taro lover completely sick of trying to get Terra to care about their products and their customers!"
1,WOW is the price a mistake or what??,"I know this music, I have had this CD for a long time and I must say that the music is great, however you can go to the John Hagee ministies web site and not pay more than 13.00 I am without words to the price tag here. Wow, its no wonder why you havent sold any........ :(Make no mistake the one star is ONLY for the ppl selling this item, it in no way reflects the Hagee family. Their music is great!"
5,Mose knows!,If you enjoy the sound of Mose you will like this CD. I like it and listen often to his unique sound.
4,Le Jour se Leve,"A very bleak but marvelous film. Jean Gabin is always watchable but this is a fantastic performance, beautiful and tragic. My one problem with this particular copy of the film is that the quality is not great and the subtitles do not translate every line, or even every other line. It has inspired me to brush up on my French, but when you buy a film with subtitles you expect at least most of the dialogue to be subtitled. A real shame."
3,Great while it worked,"I had no complaints about this product and everyone enjoyed it.. while it worked that is. We've since gone through customer support twice to replace what they said was a malfunctioning pen, but to no avail. On the good side, customer support was very helpful and easy to communicate with (not always so common any more). I'd rate this a 4 or 5 if it was still functional. I bought a 2nd one for my nieces and apparently that one is still working."
1,Back Away From the Toy,I highly recommend you do not purchase this toy! Ours was purchased as a Christmas gift. We've spent eight months of trying to get customer service to respond to us and my daughter doesn't have use of her main Christmas toy. Biggest waste of money I've ever seen!!!!! Try the Leap Frog version instead!!!!!
4,A warning about the Kindle edition,"Just a note of caution if you decide to buy the Kindle version: of course the CD-ROM is not included, and I have not been able to locate any alternative source for the example code (although the Qt software is readily available for download). I assumed this would be a minor issue, but some of their examples are cumulative, so having the source would give one the option of skipping topics that are not of immediate interest. In addition, I encountered an apparent ambiguity or omission in a description of constructing a dialog in the designer tool; having the source would clear this up, but it is difficult to resolve without it. Interestingly, the latest hardback edition does not have this problem -- the same section has a slightly different description that makes sense. So perhaps the Kindle edition is an earlier version."
2,Broken Road,"Broken Road is a disappointment to any hard core bluegrass fan in search of crisp acoustic guitar instrumentals or compelling and original songs. The lyrics are forced and cliche'd and the tunes are eminently forgettable, and the producers have smothered whatever originality is present with the dobro whinings of Jerry Douglas."
5,From the Soul of Sky and Earth,Another sublime masterpiece from these creative masters of the ancestral flute with beautiful streaming vocal accompaniment.
2,Southerner Got My Money,"I saw this book in the book store the other night and almost bought it. Norman Jewison was on the TCM documentary of Steve McQueen, seemed like a nice guy with some fascinating stories, and I thought it would be interesting to read about his career and all the celebrities he has worked with.I thumbed through the book, reading bits and pieces. On the back cover was a praising review from Gore Vidal - Strike 1. Below that was a praising review from Cher - Strike 2. Inside was a picture of Jewison with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas - Strike 3. Not to mention the book states John Wayne supposedly called Jewison a ""pinko Canadian."" Also not to mention a few other things I found offensive. I put the book back on the shelf, kept looking and wound up buying ""Capote,"" about the life of Truman Capote. He was a Southerner, a writer, hob-nobbed with the rich and famous, and on the back book cover it said he had a feud with Gore Vidal. Home run."
2,Using Filemaker 7,"Initially, I found the book a good manual with concise description. However, for the high price of the book, I expected not only a manual but also a set of templates that could be used in the real world. I found the samples a big disappointment both in preparation and design. I would expect from the top notch experts that I would end up with a valuable coherent Filemaker template system that I would be able to use at the end. (For example, a inventory, invoice and shipment tracking that has relational, lookups and multiple files). Instead these guys were jumping from militia to pet store samples."
4,Disappointing Functions separation,"I have found the book to be excellent and very clear. It is very easy to learn and provides the necessary instruction to use Filemaker 8 powerfully. It is a great product and this is a great companion book.However I was disappointed to learn that all the functions are now in a separate book. I understand the reasons, but having obtained the book and then to discover it was missing this vital section, albeit a very large section. I believe it should be marketed to buy both books at the same time, perhaps Volume 1 and Volume 2, which alerts you to the fact that you need two books. Having purchased the same title for Filemaker 7 last year and knowing all was contained therein, it was a surprise and somewhat annoying to learn of this change after the book had been delivered. I have bought the download version of the second book."
1,Not a good book for the real world,"This book is fine if you want a very complex application, but it does not touch on real world examples. It try's to teach how you to do data modeling but falls short on useful information, the book would be better if they got rid of the first 1100 pages and just published the script and functions references. If you need a book on Filemaker 7, buy the Filemaker Pro 7 bible instead. A much better series. In summary: If you are new to filemaker this book will only confuse you it will not teach you any thing useful."
1,Not worth purchasing,I only liked one song on this album and that was the first track called What YOu Gave Away (alias Remix)and it is the only godd one on othe whole album. I wouldn't only recommend the song to someone but not the album and from what i've heard from their other stuff it is the same case.
4,vanila flavored chewable protein tablets,"After I read the reviews on this product, I wanted to try them because I was looking for a protein supplement that I wouldn't have to take with water. Little to my surprise, they were great! Thank you Amazon.com."
3,uninspired.,"This cd doesn't live up to The Documentary. The Documentary was an incredible debut album, and I don't know if any of his future albums could possibly live up to it. This one doesn't. It's missing the production quality and polish that that cd had. I don't think this album sold well because of the lack of reviews and for the fact that I didn't see any advertising for it at all. The game is great however this cd is sub par. I decided to give it 3 stars instead of 2 because it's gangsta grittyness kept my head bobbing. Let's hope that he can make great albums in the future. And let's hope that he can be successful without g-unit because this album doesn't persuade me that he can be."
2,one of his less better mixtapes,"this mixtape isnt really worth any more than 2 stars,i think the game is a dope artist and im probly a bit biased when writing reveiws of his ablums,and i still didnt like it much,i just couldnt get into the beats on subject matter,it seems rushed to me,keep your cash and get one of games better mixtapes,he has a whole stack of them...lol"
5,Good CD,"The Game is one of the best to come out of the westcoast in a long time. This cd is not what you think it is, it does not have the beats that his true debut The Documentary has but the lyrics are a little better on this cd but most people will say other wise but this is my opinion. I recommend that hardcore Game fans buy this cd and people who like underground cds."
3,Another Album Produced by JT,"The First Untold Story was also produced by JT The Bigga Figga, but that one was way better than this. The production was a little better and Game was rapping more than JT. But On this one, you can hear Jt and other GetLow staff on almost every song. This can be pretty annoyin when you bought a Game's album not JT's.""For My Gangstas"", ""Troublesome"" and ""Born And Raised in Compton"" are worth mentioning songs. ""Born And Raised in Compton"" a is a remix of a song ""The Streetz Of Compton"" from WEST COAST RESURRECTION and also some other songs.Overall this album is not worth buying unless you a big fan of Game."
1,Making you a fool - wrong picture of keyboard - as they sent you ordinary one,Bozzos send ordinary keyboard when they have picture of the one with mouse in it. I want my money back - have to spend double the money to return it. I want to sue them ... A*(&*(&*(
3,Skip this one and get the Sunpak 383 instead,"I ordered this flash as a birthday present for my husband. He has a Panasonic FZ30 digital camera and it has a hot shoe for a flash. The 018ST worked with the FZ30, but it didn't offer anything over the built-in flash. The flash head does not swivel or rotate. Supposedly you could use the flash away from the camera and it would fire when the camera's flash went off. We found that it would fire less than 10% of the time in that manner.We returned the flash and bought a Sunpak 383. It works very well with the FZ30 and the flash head swivels and rotates, allowuing the flash to be bounced off the ceiling or a side wall."
3,Okay but keep shopping,"I received this as a gift to use with my Canon S3is. The camera doesn't have a hot shoe so this sould be the perfect solution. Problem is, with numerous camera settings and tweeking for hours, it only fires about half the time. Additionally, it offers little enhancement over the S3's built-in flash unless you move the flash closer to your subject. But in doing that, you lose even more shots to mis-fires. So as not to be a total disappointment, I attached an old slave trigger from my 35mm days to the top of the camera's lens and plugged it into the flash unit via a long sync cord. With this configuration, it fires 100% of the time. This ""rig"" defeats the purpuse of a wireless flash but at least I do get some use out of it."
1,"Maybe mine is defective, but these are useless","I purchased this falsh to serve specifically as a slave flash for fill-ins and effects. Unfortunately the light sensor that senses the main flash does not work. It fired MAYBE 2% of the time. The only way I could get this to fire consistently was to aim it directly at the camera's flash, which obviously isn't helpful. I would not recomend this flash to anyone. Sunpac, you got it wrong..."
1,Received wrong item,"Instead of receiving the flash unit ordered, I was sent a small camera bag with a small tripod for a small digital camera. I believe I was cheated and therefore will be quite careful of ordering from an Amazon supplier again."
3,Not bad if you're a Kwaka fan,"This book details Kawasaki racing motorcycles from yesteryear to a couple of years back. There are good stories about the efforts of Kawasaki, privateers and racing teams. I wish there were more details, more nuts and bolts info on the bikes themselves. There is not much information on Eddie Lawson's racebikes, which was disappointing but then again this is not an Eddie Lawson book. Even if you look around on the net there isn't much info on Kwaka's compared to Honda. They make interesting stuff, and a lot of friends are addicted to the new Kawasaki KSR110 in Lime Green."
4,For the video alone,I bought this CD for the video of Weapon of Choice alone. Its a great video and Christopher Walken shows off his great talent as a dancer. Well worth it just for the video. I wish they would sell it on DVD as well.
4,good stuff,"the album version of star 69 is decent, and the more i listen to it, the more it grows on me. these remixes are much the same way.xpress 2's mix, dj godfather's first mix, and tino maas's mix are really superb. godfather's second mix isn't all that great though, and the 6th track is just a vocal isolation of roland clarke repeating the song's lines over and over (for dj use i'd presume). but 4 out of the 6 songs on here are very nice. add to that the weapon of choice video, and this is well worth the money."
1,Hells Angels or 3 Stooges?,"This movie wasn't as surprising as it was disappointing. I was hoping for a gritty film about the motorocycle life style, what I got instead was a bunch of clowns somewhere between the bowery boys and the 3 Stooges mugging for the camera and trying to act cool. Basically the Hells Angels look like a bunch of high school delinquents in this film - I was expecting one of them to put a cherry bomb in a toilet next. And Sonny Barger - what a goof ball. The movie is entertaining for a laugh at how bad it is and how juvenile the bikers behave trying to act tough. So if you want a laugh, pop some corn and chuckle along."
1,Defective DVD,I tried to watch this movie on 3 different dvd players. Would not play on any of them. I bought 2 of the dvd players new within the last 9 months. I even tried it on my computer that has a dvd burner and it just locked up the program. Be Warned!
2,Unenjoyable,"Hell's Angels 69 is essentially a stereotypical caper movie in which a couple of protagonists try to pull off a heist but things go seriously wrong. Only in this case the main mistake they make is upsetting members of the Hells Angels. Using real bikers, this film had great potential, but it fails on all counts.Hell's Angels TRIES to be a deeply serious film, but unlike artistically good caper films (e.g. The Asphalt Jungle or The Killing) all the characters are one-dimensional and absolutely nobody is in the least bit likeable, nor are any insights provided. And because it tries so hard to be serious and weighty, the film commits the even worse crime of being no fun at all. It doesn't even work as an unintentional comedy. In other words, Hell's Angels 69 is nothing more than a dreary, pretentious, existentialist film about the dangers of greed and hubris. NOT a good adventure film or biker flick. Get Wild Angels (which manages to be both fun and dramatic) instead."
3,What You Get...,"Pretty good trash that is well embellished by Billy Bob Briggs comments.

3,"Yes, it's the real Angels this time","This rather lame tale of two thrill seeking rich boys out to prove they can rob a Las Vegas Casino, and use Hells Angels to do it, would barely merit mention were it not for the fact that the real Oakland Angels are stars in the film.Sonny Barger, President, Terry the Tramp, Magoo and Cisco, all of the Oakland chapter, and familiar to anyone who has read any of the books about the history of the Angels, are featured heavily here with dialogue and close ups and everything. Terry being the stand out.The motorcycles range from rather stock late sixties Harleys to a custom built chopper reportedly built by Sonny specially for the film. But these bikes are only featured in the first two thirds of the picture- the final chase scene through the desert has almost the entire cast riding dirt bikes.Overall an interesting if not great film, just to see the famous Angels, the basis for so many of the genres offerings, in the flesh so to speak."
4,Nice price,"I enjoyed watching these movies.The real Hells Angels(Oakland's chapter founder/president Sonny Barger and others) are in HA69.If you like old biker movies,buy this. Joe Bob Briggs is never at a loss of words. The commentary extra feature with him was cool."
3,"preposterous, but cool...","I first saw this cheesey B flick back in '69 or '70, back when movies like this were en vougue. Think about it. The CIA recruits a misfit group of Hells Angel types to rescue and return a US presidential advisor from behind enemy lines in Viet Nam. So, here come these booze drinking, pot smoking, verile heroes to the rescue. And what fun it is! Keep in mind, American GI's are not allowed to step foot where this hostage advisor is being held, but bikers are. They party hard before the battle, do lots of local women, retro-fit their choppers and off they go. What ensues is pure fictional hocum. Lots of slo-mo action with a cool 70's style score. A great nostalgic fix for fans of this genre.Don't worry about the intricasies of the plot and story-line here. Just sit back and enjoy. I did."
2,"Nothing great at all here, most disappointing in fact","Run Angel Run: 1 starHell's Bloody Devils: 1 1/2 starsHell's Angels 69: 3 starsThe only movie worth watching of the three in this set is Hells Angels 69, the other two are too lame even to review nevermind watch. First of all the rumble that rocked Las Vegas never ocurred in this film which did lack action. Still it was well made and it features many original members of the hells angels Oakland chapter. It is an ok biker flick. Born Losers and Beyond the Law are worth checking out if you're looking for a good biker movie. Satans Sadists is probably the best biker flick I've seen."
3,Worth the money,"If you are interested in seeing a lot of the real deal Hells Angels, this is the movie. Sonny Barger and Terry the Tramp are stars here, and you see a lot of the others as well. Lots of Bikes too. The plot was interesting, and the movie was good entertainment. I personally liked the ending of the movie."
3,hell's bloody crap.,The three and a half stars is for hell's angel's 69. Hell's bloody devil's is literally one of the worst biker films ever made if you want to even call it a biker film. the bikers in the film are hardly in it and have nothing to do with the story...It's some wanna-be James Bond rip-off only it sucks. Hell's angels 69 was actually a good movie. I enjoyed that one. It had a plot and a cool ending. I haven't seen run angel run yet so i can't say much about that one. The stand out film on this collection is hell's angels 69 though. I wouldn't buy this set only because hell's bloody devils cross-contaminated the other movies...Just buy hell's angels 69 it seperately.
4,Angels Rule!,I recently have gotten back into the old biker flicks I enjoyed as a kid in my small town theater. I had forgotten how good this movie is. It is a notch above the standard biker movie. The real angels are actually better actors than most of the real stars in these movies. The video image on this film is quite good and the sound isn't bad.I enjoyed the feature with Conny Van Dyke recalling her memories of the angels. It gave me a different insight to these guys. Recommended if you enjoy this type of film. Alot of fun to watch!
2,Okay but not great.............,"The Angels did better acting than the actors! They did their own Moto-X stunts,because they fell in the desert a few times and stuntmen would'nt have fallen.I think if the main characters would have stuck to DIRECTING/producing only and not acting/directing/producing, it would have been a lot better made. It was a little mellow and they party much harder than this depicts.It's about a C+ movie,rent it or borrow not really a keeper............The artwork on the cover is cool."
5,Hell's Angels '69,"True ""Grindhouse Cinima""... And having the Founder of HAMC and the Oakland Chapter was a Triple Plus!!! Support 81 R&W !!"
1,Made Of Cheap Tin,Don't waste your $$$ as this its made of super thin tin. I seriously doubt if it will be able to cut into dough without bending all the pieces. It is quite pitiful.
1,Very cheap,Made of very cheap metal. It bends really easily so it wasn't even round when it was delivered. Too impossible to bend back into a circle.
2,a little disappointing,"If you are expecting accurate representations of the animals, skip this. The arctic fox looks absolutely evil with its red eyes, the penguins are squeaky toys and the arctic hare is just a rabbit painted in white and black. Also, the sizes are not in scale, which is an important consideration when using these to teach young children."
3,Clinically written - but provocative ideas - a mixed bag!,"""Yadda-Yadda"" diet advice, but interesting exploration of the causes of our eating patterns. I am grateful for discovering how much I grieve for the lack of and crave intimacy with my Mom. I feel freer to deal with habits, and freer to get into real time with food and feelings. No miracles, but helpful."
1,Don't Buy This Book Unless You Love Psychobabble,"I was expecting so much more from this book than it actually delivers. Unless you've always secretly wanted to kill your mother and marry your father, this book will not give you any insight into your weight problem. This book is full of self-indulgent psychobabble nonsense. A big disappointment."
1,Absolute nonsense that strengthens stereotypes!,"It's sad to think of how many women will read this trendy pop psychology rubbish and think ""she's talking about me!"" Worse yet, those without weight problems will be further convinced of the supposed subconscious needs to be fat that brand those who do..One star was too many for this volume - save your money!"
3,great show but low quality DVD,"This was a fantastic program when I first watched it many years ago. Was thrilled to find a copy of it on DVD. Very disappointed in its quality, wonder why a better resolution could not have been produced, it doesn't even seem to be up to 240P but appears to just have been copied from an old tape. Too bad, as the images of these birds and their activities is second to no other program I have seen."
3,"Good Video, Bad Discs",Warning about this 2-disk DVD set: I've ordered this item twice from Amazon recently (1Q13) and in both cases Disc1 of the set is defective. It is not recognized nor playable on any of my various DVD and Blu-Ray players...not a region problem but an I/O error. Bad batch? Bad master? So 5 stars for content times 1/2 playable is 2.5 stars. Amazon...?
5,Another Piece of Attenborough Magic,"If you have seen Attenborough's classic, ""The Private Life of Plants,"" (not yet available on DVD for our region!) you will surely enjoy this--another example of cinematic mastery in filming wildlife. Very appropriate and much enjoyed by elementary school students with delays in reading and language. The visual simply captivates them!"
5,Excellent collection of some of Attenborough's most interesting TV specials,"Fans of David Attenborough will delight in this collection of his television specials. The world famous naturalist provides viewers with remarkable insights into the natural world and its wonders.Disc OneAttenborough in ParadiseA Blank on the MapThe Lost Gods of Easter IslandDisc TwoBowerbirds : The Art of SeductionThe Song of the EarthLife on Air - a tribute to Attenborough, with loads of archival film clipsThe Amber Time MachineThe aspect ratio is 1.33:1, in English, contains interactive menus. Be it tracking a piece of amber through time, the story behind the majestic figures on Easter Island, or the mating rituals of the birds in New Guinea (who attract mates' attention by creating works of art no less!), Attenborough's distinctive wit and flair for delivery and the amazing cinematography will delight viewers."
2,Personal Voyages,Did do care for personal voyages and telling of story along the way. I like more natural history scenery. More bird scenery and less traveling would made a better video.
4,good stuff,"performance often inspired, sometimes just north of OK. Mastery of the instrument is evident in most selections. buzz buzz buzz"
5,"Easy, cheap, handy.","Works well with a small Flip Mino type camera. I perform comedy, occasionally on the road, and this is a great little travel buddy for capturing shows on the fly. Easy to set-up and use and sturdy enough to lug around in my travel bag."
2,"Cheap, obviously","Should have known for the price and size that it would not stand up very well. The slightest breeze sends it toppling over, potentially damaging your camera."
5,Worth more than how much I bought it for.,"I took a chance and bought this item because it was half a dollar. I couldn't be more pleased, the structure feels really sturdy and the legs bend in whatever shape you want. It fits perfectly with my Kodak Playsport and I would've paid more for such a small but effective item. This is a MUST BUY. I give it 3 thumbs up if I could."
3,"OK for point n shoots, better options available","its good for what it is. tabletop tripod for small/light camera's or a camera you're okay with dropping. this tripod came with a complementary cleaning kit for my T2i(3lbs). BEWARE: it will not safely support an SLR class camera. the footprint of this tripod is waaaay too small, even just the body(sans lens) will be pushing it.its okay for tiny and lightweight point and shoots. but there are better options out there if you want ""bendy"" adjustable legs, like the JOBY."
1,You get what you pay for...buy a better one,"As a previous reviewer said, they do smell awful. This model is too short and the feet fall off. It's really just junk. For the price? Maybe. But you'll get a lot more use from a better one. I bought the Flip model after this one---MUCH better."
1,Smells really bad,"Good little unit, smells reallly bad like gasoline like so manycheap chinese imports. I will go for the flip tripod."
3,Hated with the 3M MP225A,Didn't work well at all with the 3M MP225A Mobile Projector. It is more the projector than the Tripod but this tripod doesn't work with the 3M MP225A so don't bother with it. Look for the Tripod built by 3M if you need it for a 3M MP225A.
4,Great Product Except For The Smell,"The smell is bad - it smells like smoldering rubber put out with paint thinner - but it's not overly strong. Beyond that, it's great. The screw is metal - the foot-buds are rubber and glued well - the legs retain their shape. For a two-dollar tripod, one can't do much better."
2,"Underwhelming tripod, mostly useless","Normally I'm not one for poor reviews... even after reading a lot of decent reviews on this to decide to buy it. It screws into the camera just fine, but the legs are just too stiff and rigid. Maybe I haven't ""broken it in"" enough, but even then the length of the legs and the stiffness don't seem like they will ever bode well to be an actually usable tripod. I've had better results with a webcam stand that has a multi adjustable ball-type joint thing.Its about as good of a tripod as two dollar bills would be, so just keep your money."
1,cheap junk,"Don't waste your time - get one a little less cheap. There is a reason that S&H; is more than product price.This is the same exact product as ""Vanguard VS41 Flexible MiniTripod""They don't support my tiny Lumix FX33 and are more elastic than ""poseable""."
2,Disappointed,"This is just too small, it does fir great in a purse, but the legs don’t stay bent and it changes position on it’s own when setting up a picture, keep looking…"
3,Tripod for projector,"Its a little clumsy, but once you balance the projector upon it, you are good to go. Don't bump it. Not that sturdy to stay upright, but I think we are happier having this than not. It does allow us to ""straighten out"" the screen when viewing a movie on the wall."
4,Handy little gadget,I use this as my default tripod for all electronic gadgets. It works great and holds heavy cameras without collapsing. Just make sure you position the tripod correctly and adjust as needed. Small and easy to carry around.
2,"It's a great product, just one problem...","I really like thing. I got it for my Vado HD pocket camcorder. It tips over if it's too windy, or if you put it on your dashboard for driving shots, but other than that, it's pretty stable. It's portable size and almost free price were the selling points for me. It's easy to get different angles but just so you know, it doesn't wrap around objects. It also has a little clip on the side so you can clip it to the outside of your pocket. That's a good thing because I wouldn't want to put it inside my pocket because this thing SMELLS TERRIBLE. I'm not kidding. You had to be wondering why you can buy these things for $1.35. Now you know. It smells like a combination of 'new car smell', gasoline, and tar. This thing must be toxic. It's sitting next to me on the sofa right now and I can smell its evil fumes wafting up at me. I tried washing it but it didn't help. Hopefully I can find a similar product that doesn't have this issue."
1,Toxic Odor,"I agree with the reviewer that says this thing smells toxic, like gasoline mixed with tar mixed with other nasty chemicals. It's the ""rubber"" parts that stink. I have no idea how it performs as a tripod... I've already thrashed it; it's not even worth returning for the price paid. I don't see how some of this toxic crap gets into the market. I bought a tape measure with a rubber grip (not from Amazon) that had similar odors and I trashed that thing as well. These tripods seriously stink up the whole room. Some people must be more sensitive that this type of odor than others or this product would be all zeros and removed from the market."
3,"Good, but not as great as a Gorillapod","I picked up one of these very inexpensively to carry along for spur of the moment shots using the self-timer on my camera. Although not as good or as flexible as aJoby GP1-EBEN Gorillapod Flexible Tripod (Blue), it'a s nice, cheap accessory that does not take up much space in a glove compartment or purse for everyday use."
5,Great mini-tripod,"When purchased, I knew full well the size characteristics. It does all that I want and is sturdy enough to hold a camcorder at level. It can easily hold a camera or VADO recorder at multiple angles. The main reason I bought this was to use as a holder for my camcorder, for more control & stability when taking stright shots. I can now hold it by gripping the tri-pod, which gives me the ease of use I was looking for."
2,Stiff and Tippy - Choose Another,"This is a very cheap piece of equipment. I had another version of this that came with my camera that looked very similar but worked much better. This product is a very cheap replacement and I recommend you don't waste your money and instead choose one that may cost a bit more. It does not bend well, springs back immediately to where it wants to be, and will not stand up on uneven surfaces very well. Choose another!"
4,small but works,This works for what it is... a small tripod. I use it on a flip and it has worked fine. the strength is relative to the size so don't expect to do a lot of off center angle with it. 4/5 stars for a small tripod.
4,Good except for the smell...,"I agree with the other reviewer who complained about the smell. It smells just like bore cleaning solvent from a gun cleaning kit. I happen to like that smell, but it gives you the feeling that it's got a ton of oil just waiting to stain your nicest dress shirt. Otherwise, it works just like any other tripod of this variety, and you can't complain about the price. If I were going to use this while hunting, it would be worthless as it would scare away any creature with a nose, but since this is just going in the glove box of the car, I'll give it 4 stars."
3,2 dollars product...,"well... what can you say about a tripod of 2 bucks... I bought this for a optoma video beamOptoma PK301 Pico Pocket Projectorbecause Amazon recommended it to me.First the tripod came with a broken leg, I wrote to the seller and he sent me a new one just free.Second the tripod works good with the optoma video beam, but when I connect the charger and the laptop cable to the video beam, the weakness of the tripod showed up. It doesn't have too much stability so the optoma falls.Finally, I preffer to use the tripod with our photo camera and sometimes, just sometines, with the optoma.Like I said in the beggining, what can you expect from a tripod of 2 bucks?"
2,Nice and cheap,"I just bought it and it has been working well without any breakage that other customers have suggested. It matches my need and it's cheap.Update on 02/18/12So after being used for a few times, the plastic screw head has been worn off and it no longer screws into my camcorder. Big disappointment!"
5,SunPak Mini Spider Tripod,This tiny little tripod is very handy for casual use. Its very small and the legs do not extend out but it is flexible enough. I absolutely love it for the price.
4,"tiny, light, handy for smaller cameras","I carry one all time in my camera bag, takes almost no space, but is very handy when I need to place the camera at certain angle (as opposed to just place it on a flat surface). It won't hold heavy DSLRs though.."
4,"Great value, small size","I bought this for using with my Creative Vado Camcorder, but it will definitely work with any other pocket camcorder or photo camera. The movement is sort of limited since there are no moving nor extensible parts, but for this price and size is a really good option. After all, is better having a limited tripod that no tripod at all."
3,Good,"Decent for the price, but it is kind of flimsy. I guess it is only supposed to hold a smaller camera. I haven't used this near as much as I imagined I would. I use my larger, small tripods. Good quality and great for small cameras. A negative aspect is that it isn't extremely flexible like I would expect. Decent product. Not what I prefer."
3,weak and unstable for a projector,"Not really good for a pico projector, the images will move slowly to one side. may be for a camera."
3,good for pico projectors but bad marketing by amazon.,"The tripod is very compact and its key feature is the variability of positions. Just force the fixed projector image to fit on your screen and the tripod flexs to that position and stays put.I'm happy with the tripod but not with amazons suggestion selling. I bought a pico projector and amazon suggested a tripod to go with it. Great, makes sense. Turns out the projector comes with a mini tripod. Now I have 2."
3,E J,"Nice small tripod for filming videos, but is crippled on its own for shooting anything but ground shots."
3,Cheap in price and quality,"I wish II would have seen the Prop 65 warning before ordering this product...once I received it I immediately smelled it, and it was not that stinky. I did move the legs around and one of the ball bottoms came off, all it needs is glue again. For 2 dollars I am not complaining..but its quite cheap in price in quality."
1,"This item stinks, literally","OK it might be functional but the plastic odor coming from this item reeked and was so strong that I did not want to put it in my camera bag. The odor has lasted for months. Are you folks aware that chemicals that outgass from electronics and plastics such as the ""new car smell"" are hazardous to your health? One item will not do you in, but most of us have gadget collections and the total collection of volatile chemicals can over time impact your health in subtle ways you may not recognize as due to these chemicals (fatigue, rashes, ""brain fog"", mood swings, etc.). I do my best to stay away from smelly gadgets for that reason, I would have returned it but the cost was less than postage. Manufacturers should not make products that pollute the user's environment. Which do you value more, a cheap but functional mini tripod or your health?"
4,Minbi Tripod,"Bought this to use with my Creative Vado. Light, small, simple to use and does the trick. Wouldn't be any use for a conventional camcorder as it is too small and light for that but ideal for the recent upsurge of pocket/YouTube cams."
3,Spider Tripod,Easy to use but because the legs are so small it can be a large hassle to use. I suggest paying more than $3 and opting for one with solid expendable legs. The spider legs just get annoying.
3,Great little tripod,"Great tripod for small cameras. Only drawback is that cameras have the screw connection at the end and not the middle. It should have one leg longer than the others to support the weight, albeit minimal, to allow setting up horizontal more easily."
4,Mini Tripod - Great Pocket item,"Although I ordered this tripod to be used with a Pico Projector, I found that it was too small to balance the projector. It will work great in other applications and it was ""Cheap"" to buy."
5,too cute..,"I needed a stand for my camera and my nephew told me about this one, he had recently purchased one and loved it. It is so small you can actually take it with you anywhere if you had a need to. It really is a great little stand, i have not had any issues with mine at all. It was nice and sturdy when i placed my camera on it, at first i was a little worried that something so small would hold it, but it did and i am one happy customer. Thank you!"
4,Nice piece of work,But--- well it was recommended with a projector to which it cannot be fitted. DO NOT expect this to work with an Optoma PT110
2,Not worth...I wanted this for pk301...,For the purpose I wanted this did not serve better. I wanted this for a pk301 optoma projector.This one doesnot stand still once I place the projector..
5,Inexpensive and lightweight tripod,"This is a great little tripod for casual shooting. I doesn't weigh much, and it doesn't take up much space in a bag or jacket pocket.We found it useful for taking pictures while hiking. We placed it on a variety of surfaces, from boulders to logs and found it pretty effective in nearly every situation.On word of warning: it works best with cameras that it supports close to their center of gravity. For cameras with the tripod mount way off to one side, its light weight means it can tip."
5,Excellent Info,"I'm not going off into a diatribe regarding this video series, only to say it gives you the information it says it does. Some a bit long-winded but that's what you get in a television program nowadays. Worth the price of admission."
3,Caught in the storm,"'Caught in the storm' is story detailing the clash between traditional African culture and the imposed European culture in Mali, West Africa. the story highlights the struggles of Kany, a young Malian girl who wishes to marry the young man she fell in love with while attending the colonial school. Instead, her father wishes her to marry the man he has choosen for her, a prosperous businessman, as the tradtition of their people dictates. This conflict is resolved through mediation and compromise among members of both the colonial influenced younger generation, and the oler generation who cling to their traditional beliefs. The conflict between Kany and her father sybolizes the conflict between the two cultural systems present in laterday colonial Africa."
3,Good for the Price,"Well, I've seen better translations, but this is a good book for the price. It's thorough, if nothing else. I'd recommend it if you already have at least passing knowledge of the ASC."
1,an anglo-saxson chronicle,"It wasn't what I expected. It had one word in the title I didn't conceve, and that was (""an"" anglo-saxson chronicle)I thought it was a complete book of them. Also unless you understand ""Old English"" you woun't understand this."
1,Cheaply made!,"I bought 2 of these to replace a previous one that had split at the end after removing 3 summer wheels on my Mazda3. I figured the previous one broke as I had not inserted it all the way onto the lug nut before trying to remove the nut. I tried the first replacement, making sure that it was properly seated onto the lug nut. Using just a short tire lug iron that came with my car the McGard tool twisted and collapsed. Broke without even loosening 1 nut!I filled the 2nd replacement with epoxy to keep it from breaking and was able to get the 4th wheel off.I like the McGard splined lug nut but the installation tool needs to be made stronger like their competitors. A stronger stiffer metal should do it."
4,Solid Tool,"Glad to see these are sold separately from the lugs. A mechanic kept my old tools, so I needed another one. He'd ""misplaced"" mine somewhere in his shop. Keep a spare in the garage at this price. Cheap insurance!"
4,Just what I needed,Recently my car got a flat tire when I went to put on my spare my key cracked due to a tough lug nut so I had to spend my whole Saturday going to every tire shop in my city to try and find a replacement everywhere I went no one had one with 8 splines so I decided to check Amazon and I saw this one so I thought never hurts to try when it came I was overjoyed to notice that it was the right fit. Would have given 5 stars if it were made of a better metal.
3,Wrong Part!,The company's website and Amazon's order process indicated that this would fit the security lug nut on my 1994 Corvette. It didn't. Quality of the part appears fine. Ordering system needs work.
5,non-rust tool,"my ""cheap"" lug nuts - reviewed here as well, rusted almost instatly. Thee adapter tool, rusted worse!McGard tool is spotless, lighter and of the highest quality. excellent!"
5,Great Acoustic Concert,"This is a great concert, but should be noted that there are no drums, which changes some songs signifigantly. They still rock, however, and the amount of extras on the second disc make up for it."
5,Tenacious D -- The Complete Master Works,"Hilariously funny, smart comedy, PLUS great music!Jack Black and Kyle Gass are amazing in this collection of live concerts, videos and sketch comedy.I highly recommend this purchase to all Jack Black and Mr. Show - Bob & David fans as this DVD is a collaboration with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross."
5,some won't get it...,"TD's DVD is all that any fan could ask for, which is virtually everything they've done. Plenty of extras will keep you satisfied and re-watching the duo's oddball personas hair-brained exploits. The live concert is absolutly perfect with just the two on stage with guitars. Insane! JB and KG are sublime to watch, and watch again, and again, and again."
5,The D in all their glory.,"This is a jammed-paced DVD package that is worth every penny. The first disk (called ""For the Fans"") is an entire concert recorded in England last year: this stuff is not only musically/technically wonderful, but Jack's antics are hillarious. The D's short-lived HBO series is also shown here: it's great to see them when the songs were still new and being tweaked (espically ""Tribute"", which on the show had a ""Stairway To Heaven"" thing in the first verse). The second disk is just more awesome stuff- all the videos, documentaries on the road and in the studio, and the TV apparances. This is really worth it, whether you worship the D or not."
4,For those who truly love Jack & Kyle,"Tenacious D are undoubtedly one of the MOST offensive bands ever. I only say this after having watched the DVD, and the short films. I have to say, I gagged more than once. ;) But this DVD is worth it for those who truly love Tenacious D and can stomach them at their lowest humor. Seeing the HBO show was fabulous as I'd never seen it previously. This is a definate must for psycho fans such as myself."
5,Perfect,"Warning: If you want [to be] blown out, buy this DVD!!This is THE must own for any Tenacious D fan. Everything is here...every episode from the HBO series, the videos, the making of the videos, an entire live concert and more! My wife had never seen the D before, but she likes Jack Black. She laughed like crazy during the episodes. Still can't get over how talented they are musically to go along with how funny they are. You will not be disappointed with this one."
1,"I agree, absolutely horrible","Just kidding. I wanted to see if anyone left a bad review, and I thought spoolio's was hilarious. If you don't like the ""D"" seek urgent medical attention, because you are suffering from severe brain damage. LONG LIVE THE D!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Nothing Spectacular,"I had recently got the cutest little Persian Kitten. As a new cat owner I purchased this book to get information specific to the breed. Outside a few pages of breed information, history and pictures, everything else was just general cat information. I would have expected more on breed care, grooming, and health concerns."
2,An old book,The photos inside are very nice but it doesn't represent the standart of persian cat. Here in Brazil the Persian cat is very diferent. Persian's face (principally Persian's nose) is much more different than it is showing in this book.
3,Persian Cats: A Book for the Persian Cat Beginner,"This book is a great basic overview about persian cats. It addresses a bit of the history of the breed, health tips, grooming, common characteristics of the persian, and tips for selecting a cat. However, there are no photographs of the flat faced persian. Instead, all photographs pictured are of the doll faced breed. This book serves as an introduction to the persian, and illustrates little detail."
2,General,This book gives just a general overview of cat care. It is good if you have never owned a cat before and need just general info. I was disappointed because it didn't give many specifics on Persian cats.
1,never ordered this product either,If you have me as purchasing this item please send me a confirmation
4,"Matt Kocik, Parker Ford, Pa. ""Street Smart"" is a must see""","Christopher Reeve was great in this film. Morgan Freeman was even better and more serious, this film will somewhat hold your attention because of the pimp state of mind. But never the less it's more hope taken, ""Baker"" is a superb woman looking for her own modern sex experience, with men or without men. The first hour is ""GREAT"" but the last half-hour is kind of boring, but it has a reasonable ending, with ""LAUGHS AND TEARS"""
3,ordinary film but Morgan FreeMan takes it up a notch,saw this film years ago&thought it was fairly hit&miss at best. this was when Christopher Reeve was still a A-list Actor.but Morgan Freeman [was really good]here.He has gone on to become one of the Greatest Actors Ever.the Guy continues to take His craft further&adds so much depth to His roles.this film was a step along the road to Greater things.
3,Bet on Black,Farfetched story of ambitious magazine reporter (Christopher Reeve) who fabricates a story about a pimp only to be manipulated by the defense of a real pimp(Morgan Freeman) on trial for a murder rap and the assistant D.A. trying the case. The movie is not helped by it's lackluster direction and movie-of-the-week storytelling. Reeve was more convincing as a journalist when he was playing Clark Kent. Movie is redeemed by the charismatically vicious Yoo-Hoo swilling turn by Freeman as Fast Black. The energy level on screen goes down infinitely when Freeman is not present. Kathy Baker also does a decent job as one of Fast Black's prostitutes.
3,Morgan's early work!,"Morgan Freeman a pimp? Say it isn't true! This movie is low budget. Not one of Morgan's greater pieces of work, but a little entertaining."
3,High points worth it.,"This is an uneven movie. And while movie ad excerpt quotes praising performances are almost always the sign of a stinker (damning with faint praise), in this case, I think Morgan Freeman's performance is worth this movie alone. It's nuanced, and a perfect study of a sociopathic personality. Freeman plays a total predator, who will brutalize without conscience, but will pour on immense charm in the next second as a way of manipulating others. No one had ever heard of Morgan Freeman before this movie...but he was nominated for an Oscar for this performance. He should have won it. He's up there with Brando. A great actor. And this is a great performance."
5,want these!!,"anybody have a ""like new"" set of this sage full-size set to sell me for xmas 2005 (sent December 14)-- I'm desperate!"
4,soft but flimsy,"I had cotton fleece sheets before that I absolutely love, but I thought I would give the polyester ones a try. They are fuzzy on one side ony, but they are still soft. The bottom sheet pops off the edge of the mattress during the night if you toss and turn. For the price, less than half that than the cotton ones, they are ok, I figure I got what I paid for."
1,Not Cotton!,"saw fleece sheets at another store that were polyester, but purchased these because Amazon states them as being 100% cotton.. They are not!! THey are clearly poor quality polyester at that! Shame on you amazon!"
1,It is not cotton 100%!!!!,"I received this item today.It is not cotton at all.The label said it is Polyester!Why is Amazon lying to us?!In addition, one of the pillow cases was ripped."
4,deep pockets,Dose anyone know if they are big enough for pillow top mattress. I always have problem with sheets not fitting...Please let me knoeThanks
5,You WILL NOT want to GET OUT OF BED!!!,OH MY GOD....these are the sheets from HEAVEN...my husband and I would stay and sleep all day in these if we didn't have jobs and kids to get off to school!! They are so comfy cozy.. I thought flannel was soft and egyptian sheets...but these are by far the best!! and they get softer with every wash!!! LOVE THEM and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
2,Sheds a lot,"Also, it feels really cheap. Not really happy with it. You get what you pay for, right? I gave it two stars because they're warm"
4,A fun look at Y&R,"This panel discussion is a fun look at Y&R. While I would have preferred a different mix on the panel, it was a witty as well as informative exchange. This was my first ever VoD purchase and went off without a hitch."
5,Teeing off on this Pastoral,"Ever since this superb set was released more than forty years ago, there's been agreement even among its most fervent supporters that the Pastoral is, as Mark Twain might have said, a good walk spoiled. I beg to differ. Beethoven was no duffer. As many contemporaries noted, he strode out to the countryside at a brisk pace. And, I believe, once he got there, Beethoven did not seek to depict repose or bucolic bumptiousness or even metaphysical thanksgiving. Karajan -- sounding better than ever in this remastering -- seems to be telling us that Beethoven was alive to the shimmering, pulsating, unified vitality of nature. It's been written that Karajan did not like the Sixth Symphony. I have found no statement anywhere to that effect by this nature-loving conductor himself, and certainly no evidence of it in this glorious recording."
3,"SACD set, worth the price?",".....maybe.SACD layer sounds better than CD layer; more spatial information, tighter bass and sweeter strings.You will experience more sonic improvements, if you own audiophile High-End stereo system.This set is especially suitable for the people who avoided DG Karajan recordings because of overly bright tonal qualities(Karajan glare).With this set, you can enjoy Karajan/Berlin PO with decent sound (you still hear thin lower-mid range and upper-mid range harshnesswith screechy first violin though).Is his interpretation of Beethoven's music as profound and convincing as Furtwangler's?My suggestion to you:If you want to listen to the best Beethoven cycle, do yourself a favor,Obtain the 9 symphonies by Furtwangler."
3,"Decent extension arm, poor clamp...fine for light duty","Tried this out for in-car use, the spring in the clamp is really weak and slips easily. Arm has decent range of motion, but already has loosened up to the point that it only maintains a position inside a narrow range. Ball seat mount is best part. Overall, if you need a quick clamp to pretty much anything camera mount for static shots, or maybe an accessory mount, this should be fine."
5,For Library Work,Used this clamp to photograph documents from a film reader at the library. Really worked well. Got nice crisp readable pictures.
3,"Almost great, one major flaw","Everything about this product is great except one bad flaw. As someone else stated the hand-twisted little ball tightener does not fully lock the ball in place. As hard as you can turn it by hand you will still have movement in the ball, so you better have something light on here. Disappointing because the rest of this clamp is well made.I'm using it to mount an old iphone to my baby's crib for a $5 App video baby monitor, rather than spending $500. So the ball is barely holding the weight of my phone as hard as I've tightened it.This is a bad flaw, this company had better fix this issue or just remove this product from Amazon."
5,Clip-on for camera or digital recorder,"Wow,I use a digital recorder for recording church services and musical performances. With my recorder attached to this clip on it fits almost any where and is extremely secure. I love it!"
1,Piece of Crap!!!,"I should have know better than to go based on price. If you're buying this to mount your expensive speedlite on, don't bother. It's barely good enough for an extremely light flash unit. Other than that, it's just crap. Save your money and get something more reliable and durable like a Justin clamp. Pricey, but worth the money spent."
4,Good mount,"The product is a bit larger than anticipated. But because it disassembles, is easy to carry and use. I really like its flexiblity in uses, and articulation."
3,It's pretty big,Over all I like the clamp it was quite a bit larger than I thought....I wanted to stick it in my small camera bag! I guess it probably did have the measurments on it...I was suprised!
1,"Title should be IMP, and a little php and mysql.","I was really disappointed by this book because the majority of this book is about setting up IMP, MySql, and Php on a generic Linux box.I was hoping for some good Php and MySql coding information. There are 2 whole chapters dedicated to IMP. Which is a real waste for most users that are not interested in running IMP.Over all I rate the book as poor. The last half of the book is a MySQL and PHP reference which was another disappointment. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,A guide for setting up a development platform,"Maxfield did a good job of explaining how to set up and integrate MySQL, Apache, and PHP, creating a development platform under UNIX. But Appendix A, which is more than half the book, is not much more helpful than the PHP Manual."
1,Does not live up to its title,"I bought this book hoping to learn PHP and MySQL from scratch....that didn't happen.This is not a tutorial, unless you want to set up a web based e-mail client that is.I do use this book as a syntax reference quite often but I could have printed that out from the web.Save your money."
1,Whoops i thought it was a programing book!,"Suddenly i realized after reading the first 20 pages of this non-sense that the only good use of it would be kindling for a fire! This is THE worst book I have ever read. I wasted my [money] on this fire-starter when i could have gotten a wood log for [less], what a [waste]!"
2,This book is completely misleading,I had this book on order for several months before it was published. I was excited when I heard that Amazon had finally shipped the book. Boy was I disappointed when I finally got a chance to look through this book.I was under the impression that this book would teach me to create a web based email server. All it really does it walk you step by step through installing IMP.
2,MySQL & PHP from scratch,I was rather excited when Amazon alerted me on this book. I had been looking for a book which would help me with developing a web-based email application for ages.I was extremely disappointed when I finally received the book. It was totally misleading!If you are looking for a book to understand what tools and software is required for developing web based applications then you might find it useful but then again any MySql and PHP book will explain.It unfortunately does not take you under the hood to see how the MySql database is designed/created or writing the necessary PHP code to integrate it all.
2,MySQL and PHP From Scratch,"This book is not very helpful. It spends one third of its content to cover specific installations, almost other two thirds for an appendix of PHP term listing.I don't think it delivers the purpose as its titile says."
1,Disappointment!!,"This book was a major disappointment. I had expected to gain some knowledge on how to administrer a site with a bunch of users in the form of a mailhotel, and perhaps get to know some of the tricks of MySQL. All it does is to show how Maxfield solved _one_ particular problem.I can't think of any group to which this book should give any benifit. Experienced programmers won't learn anything new. New programmers wont get the point, and the appendix is not better than Core PHP Programming... I wish I could have my money back..."
2,Not a good book,"If you want to learn PHP & MySQL, you will NOT find in this book. Much of it is reference. I bought it used for about a third of its price, but still feel a waste of money."
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought this book thinking I would get a good overview of each of the countries the authors lived in. Instead the book consists of lengthy conversations between them and their friends, intersperesed with really trivial and banal comments. Given that both authors are academics, I expected some depth--but there was none. A real waste of money."
4,Silver Screen - my opinion,I am not much of a review writer. I will say I picked this book up several years ago and did not get very far before putting it down.This time it was more interesting at the beginning and ever more interesting as the story developed. The end was a surprise to me although some of you may see it coming. I found myself wanting to email the author and ask her if I got it right.If you have read her most recent series you will find this book slower moving. Nonetheless I think it is worth the time to read it.
4,What it means to be human in a mechanized world.,"Justina Robson's SILVER SCREEN has been shortlisted for the Arthur C. Clarke Award and tells of one Anjuli, who has a number of problems: a too-good memory, a boyfriend whose job is turning him into a cyborg, and struggles with machine intelligence. All her problems seem to center around a basic question: in a world where computer and man are becoming closer, what does it mean to be human? Strong characterization keeps this first-person futuristic story fast-paced and compelling."
4,must-read material for New England riding,"With basically one day to plan my trip (so I am a bit last-minute these days), this book was an indespensible boost in the good-time department. It is a great book to get you started, and provides all the necessary clues to create your own journeys. After a couple of days, you get to understand the way the maps illustrate the individual roads, and marty's book helps you identify the best kinds to explore. Sometimes the routes get confusing, but that just adds to the adventure. Makes a great gift, as I told the friend who got it for me."
4,Motorcycle Journeys through New England...,"I purchased it for my husband... he has been reading and enjoying it. It's always good to find those special places to drive, especially since the northeast is so limited in drive time!"
2,Shame Shame,The product came great! Perfect delivery and everything. The odor with it was well..whatever I got over it lol. Sadly the product did not work for me..Like no hair came off.
4,Nontraditional Western Fan,"This is the first Western that I have read in years and it's probably the best Western I have ever read. While I have read very few Westerns this one was a very quick and enjoyable read. Mr. Parnham is a gifted story teller and provides his own twist on what may be considered a traditional Western,adding a Fairy Tale element to this crusty old genre. The guy who is the gunslinger is a surprise and the bad guys certainly get theirs in the end. I am certain I will purchase more of Mr. Parnham's books in the future."
3,"Movie is terrific (5 stars), but DVD falls short","The film itself is extrememly entertaining with a great cast, wonderful color, effectiver music, good special effects. But considering the possibilities of DVD, I was disappointed in what the techicians did. Yeah, there is a trailer with DeMille himself, and some text about the movie and the actors, but it could have been better. Still, it preserves a film in pristine condition for multiple viewings."
1,Very Poor Video Quality,This is a great movie but the video quality of this disc is extremely poor. I have seen this movie on TV and therefore know that clean prints exist. There is no excuse for this mess. It's as if it is a really bad pirate job.
4,"Exciting, romantic, far-fetched","I liked this film better the first time I viewed it than the second time around. Paulette Goddard was good and this film evoked my interest in her as an actress. The plot involves swashbuckling types and southern belles and the premise is a little extreme, but as another reviewer said, it is good escapism fare. It does have spectacle!"
3,good for occasional use,"If you plan to use this item regularly and for long periods of time it cuts into your hand as there is no handle. The metal is thin and I think it would not last long. Having said that, I have not found any cutters of better quality."
3,You get what you pay for,"This little tripod works just fine for only the smaller and lighter cameras and camcorders. Don't even think of using it with a full size DSLR. I have the Nikon D7000 and, with just a 35M prime lense attached, easily overwhelmed this little guy. I ended up stripping out the thumbscrew trying to tighten it and prevent my camera from sagging forward. Even when I managed to have everything tight and balanced just right, it was pretty precarious at best, not a risk I'd want to take with an expensive camera. For $15-$20 more, there are several much better options available in small tripods. That said, with our much lighter and smaller Nikon point-and-shoot and a Canon camcorder, it worked just fine."
3,Color output not even close to photographs,"I bought these colors hoping to make a beautiful rainbow cake as pictured in the customer photographs. Unfortunately I ended up with a pastel rainbow cake. I tried several different recipes and different concentrations of color in my batter and didn't get a single vivid color. I'm not sure if I got a dud batch or if they're all like this, but it was very disappointing. I did not notice any difference in the flavor of the cake due to the coloring, which was the one positive quality of this set. Guess I'll save them for springtime baking..."
1,Very Annoyed,I was very annoyed with these dyes. In order to get bold colors I had to add a lot of dye and then the icing had a strange taste to it. The copper is pink. The black is actually purple. These were just not worth the hassle.
5,You gotta love it!,"I love the colours they were brilliant and you just need a little to get a lot!I would by all means recommend this product to all consumers its a great buy and will last a long time, since you just need a little to colour the fondant.I am happy with this purchase !!"
3,Really small,"This product is great and necessary for my mother to her business, the only thing is that we thought they would be bigger jajaja it was so funny when we opened the box and the container were really tiny, but it is an excellent product."
4,colorful!,"The colors came out very nice. The only issue I had was with ""no taste"" red. I had trouble getting to the dark red I wanted and had to use a lot of dye. Other than that the cake came out beautiful!"
5,Intense,Wow now these are intense color. One tiny drop and it's very vibrant! I had to use a toothpick on some things since I was coloring a small amount and it would have been way too dark.
3,Careful what you use it on,"I used a *whole vial* of red on a batch of frosting and it still came out Salmon. I looked up the issue and learned that all whipped frosting will never be anything but pastel. ...not good for a Star Wars ""Dark Side"" cupcake. So, without red left and the frosting gone, I completely revamped into a glaze. I'll chock the loss up to naivete, but it was a huge waste of color.I suggest looking up what works on what types of frosting before coloring it."
4,Wilton Icing Color,"This food coloring works great. It's the paste kind, which really does color better, more vibrantly and wastes less than any other kind. Also, it comes with an extensive color palette, which inspires you to do better cake decorating (I think.) Strangely enough, it even comes with brown and black. Also, this works for more than just icing. I'm an arts and crafts director at a summer camp, and we use this stuff to tine salt dough, dye paper... you name it."
5,"Vibrant colors, easy to mix",This set of icing colors is perfect for what I needed. It's a good value and it covers all the basic colors I'd need.It doesn't water down the icing and it's easy to mix in. The colors are vibrant and a little goes a long way. What more could you want from food coloring right?
5,great color assortment,"very good color assortment has twelve colors, works great, a little goes a long way so use sparingly. the set of twelve is a much better deal."
3,Red is pink,"Unfortunately, the red is pink, and the black is gray when i used it for cupcake but for icing they work perfectely.I wonder if any one can give me a tip on how to make it pure red and black for cupcake."
1,Made from coal tar,"Please know what your eating, the color is made from coal tar. Your body is effected by petroleum products....... Do some research?My children go crazy on this stuff, adhd to the max!"
4,"Vibrant color, small size","These icing colors are the best for creating the most vibrant colors. There is a good variety of colors in this kit, giving you endless combination options. The only downfall is that the actual size of each color is small. That said, however, a little color goes a long way. It only takes a small amount to create bright colors, so I have plenty leftover for the next time. Recommended!"
2,A First Chapter Lacking Clarity,"I have just read, and unfortunately re-read and re-read, the first chapter ""Causes"" in the 1995 paperback version of ""Style Toward Clarity and Grace"". The author states on page three that ""English writers have responded to three influences on our language.Two are historical and one cultural."" The two historical influences are quickly dealt with, but the cultural influence is never clearly presented. I read the chapter at least four times, but couldn't find what he was talking about. Perhaps it was edited out of this edition. A very frustrating beginning to the book. Perhaps, the author would be kind enough to tell this reader what is the cultural influence he spoke of, and on what page(s)?"
5,Just what I was looking for to improve my writing,"I want my writing to be clear, cohesive, coherent, concise and elegant. This book is showing me how."
4,You're Better Off if You Buy - Ten Lessons,"By itself, this book is helpful. But its not nearly as helpful as Williams other book ""Style - Ten Lessons Towards Clarity & Grace,"" which is also available through Amazon.com. This version of Style simply presents Williams' theories about writing, but it does not provide the reader with the ""workbook"" drills that are contained in ""Ten Lessons."" A reader will only understand the value of Williams' techniques after he's had a chance to apply them. I recommend this book without reservation, but believe that most readers will benefit more from the ""Ten Lessons"" version."
4,First I've Owned,"I bought a set of offset spatulas even though I do very little baking. They are handy to have for other uses while I'm cooking. This set of 3 are perfectly graduated in size as to provide the right size for every task I've used them for. They are stainless steel and clean up easily by hand, or can be thrown in the dishwasher. I find them very helpful in removing things from half sheet pans. The offset allows them to lie flat clearing the rim, without having to contort hands, arms, and wrists to do it. Everyone should have a set and at this price, there's no reason not to."
3,Ateco offset spatulas,I was surprised when I received these because we already have two slightly different ones. These somehow seemed flimsier and did not match the ones we had anyway so I returned them without ever having used them. Amazon's service was great as usual.
5,Really Great Product,"These spatulas are very handy sizes. They are of great use in a variety of ways, not just icing cakes, but especially for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches."
3,Change of Pace,"If you like Paula, and many folks do, you will enjoy this magazine. They are light and enjoyable reading. However, the magazine really is giving the reader a ""taste of Savannah"" and a look into Paula's life...perhaps a bit too much. They are not pure cooking magazines. Also, if you have all of Paula's cookbooks, you may have the recipes already. Hopefully as the magazine progresses, there will be less of Paula's life / house / family / etc, and more new recipes.I agree 100% with the comments already made that the price listed here is not a good value. I got my subscription from the magazine's website for far less. The price listed here is comparable to that of magazines that come monthly (Paula's is once every two months) and that are much larger. Paula's magazine is about 1/3 the pages of a ""Cooking Light"""
3,Paula Deen Magazine,"I am looking forward to receiving the magazine, BUT it's taking 2-1/2 months to receive the first issue!"
3,I like the magazine,"This isn't a slickly-produced title like Gourmet or Cooking Light. It's a locally done magazine skewed toward an older audience with easy recipes using supermarket ingredients (what ""semi-homemade"" SHOULD be). I don't think the recipes are of the caliber you'd find in one of Paula's cookbooks, but they are easy and most people will enjoy them. Note: As in many magazines, seasonings in the amounts called for in these recipes will result in a bland finished product. You can easily double the seasonings in them on the first try, without even tasting the recipe first."
1,why didn't they care?,"I ordered a subscription to the magazine. I am an advanced cook and get a lot of cooking magazines. My first issue came in late January. It was their Thanksgiving and Christmas issue!! The Winter issue was already out, of course I did not get that one. I wrote that I was upset about them trying to just dump old issues and take the money. I asked how I would cancel if I decided to. I did not get a return response as promised ... instead, they just canceled the subscription without telling me, no notice, no apology. What a sham!! The bad taste in my mouth lingers. I am no longer a fan of a person who will allow people to be treated like they are stupid and not worth respect. I have been happy with all of my experiences with my other cooking magazines."
2,"Good read, not so good recipes...","Yes, Paula Deens magazine is nice to look through, but every recipe I have tried, such as the cakes, they do not work. Those cake pictures look so good, but then when you make the recipe, it's not a pretty picture! In fact the only book to ever come close to being 'right on' in recipes is the little Christmas book I purchased about 2 years ago. Those recipes work.If you're just buying her stuff to look at, it's more than perfect. But if you're buying to actually cook from them, spend your money on good quality cookbooks."
3,Shipping problem,"At this point I really cannot review the product,for my friend in Shanghai,China has not received the book as a gift from me.. My review in essence should be viewed as a review of my experience in buying a product from Amazon and using Amazon's ""international standard method"" to ship the prodect. I have to say that the experience is very frustrating. I ordered the book in late March and chose the international standard method for shipping and Amazon's confirmation stated that the product should arrive between April 29 and May 8,2007. As of this very moment, my friend has not gotten the book. I believe there are two possible points of confusing: it was not clear to me at the time of my choosing the so-called international standard was meant to be shipping through seafare for overseas, and the international standard method was untrackable.Ok. That is my frustration and the worry that the book may never reach my friend."
5,"Excellent size, price and total package","This is a great keyboard. Has everything you need in MUCH less space. Also lays flat on the desk if you want it to.Why do other keyboard (and PC) makers insist on adding more useless features instead of making good functional products like this? We've bought 3 of them. The price can't be beat and the spillproofing has come in handy more than once, too!"
4,Back to school on Cybertron,"I'm a huge Transformers fan, and since my 5 yr old is starting school, I onlyt hought it appropriate to carry on the family legacy of Transfandom...so I bought this backpack for my son, and he loves it...it's quite a bit more advanced and flashy than the one I had back in 1986, but it's state of the art for my son.Very sporty, the water bottle is a nice touch, there's enough space to store all his papers, supplies, folders, books and other school stuff. It's comfortable for him, and seems as well made as anything else like that is in this day and age...kids can be rough on backpacks, so time will tell.Overall, a decent value."
2,backpack review,purchased for a little boy who had no Christmas and needed a packback this proved to create a more pleasant and hard working child in school
1,Guess I should have read the reviews more carefully!,Same outcome as the other reviewers...this battery is NOT compatible with the charger that comes with the Canon EOS Digital Rebel. Beware!!
1,Sunpak BP 511 equivalent,Like most of the other reviewers I found that the battery would not charge in the Canon charger. A second replacement battery also had the same problem The CANON battery had no such problem.
4,I liked it but never found myself wanting to read the next story,"The short stories are well crafted but not pretentious or inaccessible in any way. I think it had more punch when it came out since ghosts and unicorns were still ironic, but it still has an impact. It's so completely feminine (I am a dude by the way) in a way that dudes can enjoy but not relate to - and sort of explains the actions of some of the fringy girls on the playground when I was growing up. The accounts of living in Echo Park seemed forced. There were only a few stories that really sucked me in - the rest seemed to try to create a mood but never went anywhere. I'd still recommend it though."
5,Pretty Nice,"Quality is very nice. Detailing is very good also.Only one thing hindered me about this model however...When building the cockpit portion with the 2 solar panel wing pylons, the instructions weren't the best.What I had to do was glue everything on the top portion of the cockpit instead of the base, which was told of me. That was the only thing that was a little frustrating.But when you see if when it's finished, it comes out real nice.A plus for this model is the display stand, although I wasn't sure to glue the Interceptor onto it so I didn't, as well as 2 support pieces if you don't want to use the display stand.This is my 2nd model that I glued together myself, and my first to paint.Rather fun to build these kinds of models I should say."
4,"Nice model, terrible instructions","Really nice size model... but the instructions were terrible. The color scheme is completely wrong and the little figure (pilot) is not correct. He looks more like an unpainted X-Wing pilot rather than a TIE pilot. They make a mistake with that one.You have to use your imagination and your own research to get the colors correct. I painted mine last night and worked out perfectly, using mostly military colors (flat battle gray, black)."
4,satisfied customer,I have not been able to buy this product in the stores for several months. Buying on line was easy though more expensive.
2,"Good look, but flemsy","This was good looking but had very flemsey construction. I would not order again, or use where I need a durrable item."
5,An invaluable resource for field botanists,"Brown & Kirkman have synthesized a wonderful, comprehensive guide to Georgia trees. Many species distributions overlap with other states, however, so this guide is useful for most of the Southeast. In addition to species descriptions, they include valuable habitat and economic information. Perhaps the most unique feature is the ""Recognition difficulties with other taxa"" section that is included with every species description. Now even beginning botanists can distinguish Post Oak from Sand Post Oak with ease."
3,Pictures in the center of the book.,"I's like this book a lot more if the all the tree photos were adjacent to the text description, instead of all the pictures being concentrated in the center of the book."
5,Mole Music,David McPhail writes some amazing books. This is one of his lesser known books but my first graders really enjoyed it.
4,Estabrook - 3rd Grade,We read this book in our classroom and really enjoyed it. Some of our comments are: I liked how Tucker found his name from the sweet shop; Because they are cute; Like how Tucker goes crazy over food and its funny; Finally how a cat and mouse our friends; If you like adventurous books it is fun; Liked Sid Rat and Charlie; How the three rats have a Boston accent in Time Sq NYC; How they are scared of the rats big eyes; Funny; Dramtic
4,"Fairly well-written, with a bit weak ending...","One of the longer Star Trek novels, this one has the makings of a fairly strong plot, centered around an alleged violation of the Federation's Prime Directive-that a developing civilization not be disturbed until it was truly ready to make contact with other star-faring peoples. The traditional Star Trek characters are fairly well-developed, and the plot, though a tad slow at times, is capable. My only complaint was that the ending seemed a bit rushed in comparison to the skillfulness with which most of the rest of the work was laid out. Nevertheless, this is probably one of those must-read Trek novels."
4,Kirk No Longer a Hero?,"In a time where the people of a planet are affected by a decision Kirk makes to save the Enterprise when the people of that planet jeopardize her safety, Kirk and the Enterprise Six (includes all but Scotty) are put on trial for breaking the Prime Directive. It is a great book and a great story. I would suggest this for any TOS fan."
5,best first chapter i've ever read,"I have never read a more moving and powerfull first chapter then the one in this book. The book kinda loses some its luster after that but is still a very good story, that first chapter is a hard act to follow. The captain is dishonored and the crew is dispersed, what happened?. The story is told in both the present(trek, that is) where variouse crew try to cope with the disintigration of their starfleet careers and flashbacks to the past where the disaster happened. good stuff."
5,Simply the Best,"This is the best Star Trek novel I ever read. The best Sci-fi novel. It's one of the best BOOKS I ever read!The storytelling is superb, absolutely moving. The Reeves-Stevens have outdone themselves again this time. It does not get any better than this."
2,kind of disappointing.,"From the moment I picked up this book at a second-hand store, I couldn't wait to read it. The premise was so captivating, plus I love the Reeves-Stevens' books. However, the more I got into it, the less I liked it. While I enjoyed the idea of Kirk as a fugitive, the thing with the uncontacted planet was boring. The ending and the discovery of the true culprit was quite unbelievable. Alos, the rescue of the Enterprise and the reunion of the crew was very corny and a little too unrealistic. I also hated Kirk's love interest, the woman form Who Mourns from Adonis,she really got on my nerves! If you want a good novel from these authors read Federation and leave this one in the book bin."
4,Two Sams At Once,"I know this one has been out of print for a while, and it is customary to review newer things or at least things that can be located without a search, but I couldn't stand to see such a fine book supported only by a one star review. This is the only novel where Sam Leaps into two people at once, identical twins. His psyche is split in half, and we get two different versions of Sam: the side that is dedicated to solving the Leap and continuing on to help more people, and the darker more selfish side that is tired of jumping around and wants to settle down and satisfy his own desires. Their two lives unfold and they finally confront each other at the end. I had to leave off the fifth star because this one doesn't reach the emotional depth of several others in the series, the ending is good but not very touching (unlike Angels Unaware, which is perhaps the best in the series)."
1,Keep looking.,"The title says it all. The publisher gambled double or nothing and lost. Hernderson's portrayal of the time tripping Sam Beckett was very sub-par. The story was bland with very little relation to the television series what so ever. I give it two thumbs down, only because I am limited to only two thumbs. If you want a good QUANTUM LEAP book, try ""Odyssey"" or ""Pulitzer"""
2,just for the basics,"If you have ever washed a car before, this book is not for you. This book is made for someone who has never washed a car in there life. I am still shopping for a more advanced book, this is not it. Very good for a beginner though."
3,Mostly common sense,"Nothing earth shattering here and it reads like the insert from your latest prescription. Lots of common sense tips, but that's not all bad, because we can all use a reminder now and again about things we already know. A bit dated, but the techniques and principals haven't changed as much as the products. There were a few gems scattered here and there and my time spent uncovering them was certainly not wasted. I may even reference it again from time to time - but not if I'm looking for a chuckle."
3,Helpful Tips,There are a few good tricks revealed in this book. Proper techniques are detailed. I love keeping my car looking new - this book recommends some methods for doing so.
3,Top 10 Reasons You Can't Blame the Wicked Witch of the West,"This is a fun, albeit a bit over the top enhancement on the story we all have known for so long. Maybe a bit too political and philosophical. All this time we thought she was really wicked. Well, you can't really blame her:10) Her father loved her sister more than her and freely admitted it.9) Her mother was a pill-popping depressive.8) She never really got close to her mother.7) Her mother was promiscuous and cheated on her father.6) Her father was a latent homosexual.5) Her parapalegic sister was crushed by a house.4) She never bathed in her life--and couldn't.3) Without her permission, her best friend gave away the only family heirloom after her sister's death.2) The only love of her life was murdered.And the number one reason you can't blame the Wicked With of the West is: She was born green!"
1,Didn't Live Up To The Hype For Me,"I had heard nothing but good about this book, and I was excited by the premise. It came as a disappointment to find that I couldn't get into it at all. I persevered with it for a while but became so bored that I couldn't focus on it anymore. I put it down and never picked it up again.I thought it was a shame that such a great idea was rendered in such a uninteresting manner. However, it appears that I am in the minority in thinking this. Perhaps it would have made a difference had I ever seen the stage show?"
3,Good...if you can get through it,"Being a huge ""The Wizard of Oz"" fan, I was excited when I heard about this book. The beginning of the book grabbed my interest. It made me laugh. But towards the middle of the book, I got too confused by all of the countries, nationalities, and the politics. I finally stopped trying to understand it all and plowed through it. The end was as wonderful as the beginning. If it weren't for the hundred or more pages in the middle, this would be one of my top picks."
1,If you like Jerry Springer then you will love this book,"On the basis that there is a grain of truth to every myth this author applied that truism to a well-known fictional character. In doing so he went perhaps a bit too far. Everything that was enchanting about Oz became perverse. Characters took on opposite personalities, and became guilty of every petty motive or moral debauchery possible. The author seems to have exploited every sleazy device to tell this story; rape, adultery, murder, manipulative personalities, animal cruelty, social snobbery, political machinations, and on and on. The story went on forever and became more and more depressing.This story, like others by Maguire, is dense with interweaving plots, too many characters and events, some of which are never fully explained so the significance to the story is questionable. The result is convoluted, sluggish and self-absorbed. I don't recommend this book at all."
1,Wicked IS Wicked!,"After seeing the broadway show 2x, I wanted to learn more about this exciting story of Wicked. I found it a very confusing and not easy to follow.I wanted so much to like this book, but it is in a pile of my wishful collections. One day I my skip the first few chapters and see if it gets better.Hard read and was not fun....painful is more like it."
1,"If Evil is Boring, I Have Found a Truly Wicked Book","I read the book, because I was hypnotized by the previews of the Broadway musical. When I saw the negative reviews for the novel, I thought that the readers were being unfair. However, they were truly correct. Gregory Maguire's only decent contribution to the world of literature was allowing us to perceive the Wicked Witch of the West in a different light. Everything else he wrote was a mish-mash of dense and boring musings. His interest in the nature of evil was the only thing guiding the book, and he did not even end up doing a good job at exploring the subject. He seemed more preoccupied with inserting extraneous sexual content that was relatively meaningless, which brings further questions about the nature of his psyche more than the nature of evil. Was this a treatise on evil, a bad romance novel, or a boring stab at an interesting concept? I still cannot resurrect a reply."
1,Wicked Warning!,"I cannot understand the good reviews for this book. Apparently, fans of the ""Oz"" books like it. I've only seen the movie and I liked the premise, but this book has no plot, no character development, no tension. Just random acts. When she's attaching wings to monkeys, we want to know why."
2,"It has a WICKED good premise, but.............................","I've heard great things about this book this book. Some on how Elphaba is an awesome character, other son the great premise and Maguire's writing style, but they all left out one thing: Greg here knows not how to pace a book. The book Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell(AMAZING BOOK, must read) which is, at 1006 pages, almost exactly two and a half times longer then this book, which is 406 pages. However, It took 2 and a half times longer to read this book then JSaMN. When it takes shorter to read a book thats over 2x as long as another, even though it isn't a thriller, you know theres somthing horribly wrong."
3,Interesting...,"I just finished the novel and came to read customer reviews. I didn't think there was that much sex in it. Someone said there was sex on every other page, which is not true.I was frustrated at times, where the author hints at things, but does not follow through with explaining them.The ending was anticlimatic - I suppose because I knew how it would end, but the author didn't write the end as most people would remember it.I skimmed through a lot of the political passages which I found boring, but I admit, I grew to not necessarily LIKE Elphaba, but sympathize with her."
4,Wicked,This is the second time I have read the book and found 'new' things this time around. Looking forward to reading the next one.
2,pul-lease make it stop,"I'm planning on seeing the musical Wicked this summer, so I was hoping to read the book it was based on. What a mistake...I consider myself to be a voracious and no-so-picky reader, but I CANNOT finish this book. It is pure drivel. The only reason I didn't rate it zero stars was that the premise is interesting, but honestly, the writing could have been done by a junior high school student with a thesaurus. Give me a break!"
4,"Good read, but weak in spots","I'm still reading, but thoroughly enjoying this book. I think the reader needs to divorce himself/herself from trying to ""hook up"" with the events in the original Wizard of Oz. There are too many loose ends. So, just relax and take it for what it is, a good read that's quite unique."
4,Wicked,"Wicked takes the reader back to the Land of Oz before Dorothy, tracing the life of Elphaba--later known as the Wicked Witch of the West. Gregory Maguire shows Elphaba's life from her birth to her destruction, and creates one of the greatest heroines in literature. Born green, she is subjected to cruelty and hardship all her life, but perseveres with her strong beliefs. Elphaba is an educated girl who is passionate about equality for all, but when the Wizard threatens that equality, she is willing to sacrifice everything to fight it. It is a story about one girl's struggle to make a difference, with the help of familiar characters like Glinda and new, imaginative characters. Maguire puts a new spin on a familiar story, challenging the notion of evil and making us question its true nature."
2,I tried so hard... I really did!,"I raved about this book to everyone I met for the first hundred pages or so. After that, I realized my attention span was waning. The characters are so hard to keep straight and the story seemed to drone on forever. Despite my waning interest, I really wanted to finish the book before I saw the Broadway show. Alas, it didn't happen. I realize that life wasn't over and that I enjoyed the play without having finished the book.The idea is phenomenal. How creative. The execution and the actual story, however, is one I could not get into."
1,Wicked is Torture For Its Readers,"This is an awful book.It starts out interestingly enough, explaining the origin of the Wicked Wich, green skin and all, but then gets mired in a ridiculous and unbelievable plot about religion versus naturalism and the rights of talking animals. In the process, Maguire goes off on pointless tangents about bestiality, class consciousness and consipracy theorists.When you finish it, you'll be singing ""Ding, dong, the book is done!"" It's an overly long exercise in nonsense."
1,Worst Book Ever,We chose this for book club thinking it would be a good choice for Halloween month. Not one of us could get through this awful book. We opted to have a dinner this month instead of bookclub-thats how bad it is.
1,Don't Bother,"What a boring book. Normally, I finish all books, but this one I couldn't. Why? It was so boring and lacked any richness in it's words. Even after reading half, it didn't improve."
5,Ambitious allegorical fiction,Wicked is an excellent allegorical satire of the human condition. Maguire covers everything from oppression of a society by a political dictatorship to oppression of people by racism and the confines of class structure. Clever use of characters that most people in the United States are familiar with. Very satisfying reading through to its rather ironic ending. I believe this is Maguire's first published novel and I look forward to his next work.
1,This is not your basic yellow brick road...,"I love the Wizard of Oz and everything about it - for many, many years. Imagine my excitement when I read the premise for this book - how clever and what fun !!But alas, when we enter the City of Emeralds Fiyero and Elphaba get to the, pardon me, root of the situation. What a bummer. Why did we have a great plot, imaginative characters, and then ruin it with obligatory sex? This ain't Peyton Place - please ....Why couln't this book have been as decent and true as the original Wizard? Leave the sex stuff to book of that genre. The Fiyero and Elphaba scene ruined the book for me"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME- TERRIBLE BOOK,"This book is horrible, from just a few pages in you start to get a glimpse of the meaninglessness of the plot. The story line is pathetic, has nothing to do with the musical and just has one perverse reference after another that has nothing to do with the story."
2,Disappointing,"If you are interested in reading the book because you like the soundtrack from the musical, prepare to be disappointed.A strange and very intellectual read, not nearly as ""fun"" as I expected it to be. personally did not like the character of Elphaba at all, and I find it hard to enjoy a book when I dislike the protagonist (or anti-hero, as the case may be). The plot of this book, in addition, seemed disconnected and random. It was hard to get into the story, hard to care about the people involved, and at times just had an uncomfortable feel to the setting.At best, this is a unique study of good and evil in fiction. However, unless you're an English student studying feminis literature or fiction archetypes, this book has little to offer."
1,"Disappointing, Vulgar","Considering my first introduction to WICKED was the music, I eagerly looked forward to the book. The first page should have told me not to pay full price for this piece of ranting, vulgar junk. I can't believe that anyone could or would make such a great musical out of this book - and that is the nicest thing I can say about the book. DISAPPOINTING!"
1,What the h***?,"i read this book because i liked maguire's confessions of an ugly stepsister (which was great, btw). thus, i was excited to see how he twisted the classic tale of oz but i was majorly DISAPPOINTED. i think the author got in way over his head when he retooled the original."
1,Wicked Hard to Get Through,"I read this book years ago when it was first published. I recall little except that I didn't like it. Not remotely. The plot was unengaging and the characters unsympathetic. I am confused by its recent surge in popularity, and recommend skipping this one."
2,Strange Coming of Age Novel,"Since I enjoyed the Broadway Play, ""Wicked"" and have always liked fairy tales, I thought this would be a great read. In addition, I had enjoyed an entertaining talk given by the author at a local Arts and Letters program. I was very disappointed. I had to push myself to finish it. It came across as a strange coming-of-age novel, which requires a deeper analysis than I was willing to give it to appreciate it."
2,Go see the play!,"The book was hard to follow..very boring, so hard to follow and so boring that i did not finish it. I did see the play before i read the book and there is no comparison..use the money you were going to spend on the book and put it towards your theatre ticket...the play was magical."
3,Slow start but worth it,"It took me a little while to get into this book. But about 60-70 pages in, I was hooked. The general storyline had me in the beginning, it just took me a bit to get used to Maguire's writing style.While I am not quite done, I find myself rooting for Elephaba!! When I think back to the Wizard of Oz, it makes me feel for her!"
1,Horrors! Horrors!,"This book was painfully disappointing. The plots meanders here and there and never fully develops. The writing is mediocre, and the book left me feeling cheated. The books sums itself up with the only funny line in it - ""Horrors! Horrors!"" Don't waste your time!"
2,"Starts out well, then goes to hell","It's difficult for me to say what I think of Gregory Maguire's ""Wicked."" On the one hand, the premise is truly interesting and Maguire writes well, with compelling characters and rich (if sometimes heavy-handed) symbolism. Unfortunately, although he ostensibly chose to set his tale within the land of Oz imagined by L. Frank Baum, Maguire soon jettisons this well-known world of childhood in favor of his own postmodern interpretation. The result is an Oz of relational angst, animal activism, political intrigue, alcohol abuse, murder and explicit sex, with more than a little autobiography mixed in for good measure. The result is a story that unspools like a broken film from a projector.This is the rarest of books: a story where the musical adaptation is far superior to the source material. Don't bother with the book if you can see the Broadway production instead."
3,Not what I expected,"I'm reading this book because I loved the music from the musical (which I have yet to see). And it is not at all what I expected. I'm having trouble finding the motivation to keep reading. It's a bit darker than I thought, and if the musical is popular with younger kids, I would definitely not let them read this without reading it yourself first. Parental guidance is suggested here parents."
4,Wonderful--WARNING: THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR CHILDREN,"This is a wonderful book for so many reasons: great story and writing, interesting look at the nature of evil, etc. (see other reviews). That said, this book contains some graphic sexuality and other complexities that are just not for children. The play is O.K. for kids, the book really isn't. All parents are different about this sort of thing, but seriously, if your kid is younger than 15 or 16 read it, and decide for yourself. (You only need to read the first hundred pages to know.)"
5,What Does It Mean To Be Wicked?,"If Elphaba is ""the Wicked Witch of the West"", then we have to question exactly what it means to be wicked. This very question is something that Elphaba wrestles with throughout the novel. Perhaps ""being wicked"" is only one way to explain the behavior of someone we don't fully understand. And perhaps those we label ""wicked"" are those who don't make an effort to understand us. This book gives you a lot to think about, either way."
3,why?,"Overall I felt this book was pretty good, but I felt I was left hanging about certain parts of the story. Another review said how the author hints to things, but then doesn't elaborate on them. I agree with this.I wanted to know more about her childhood. I wanted to know what happened to Fiyero. I couldn't wait for her to confess to his wife and it never happened. I'm lefting wondering why on a lot of things.The author does drag on a little on some parts, but I'm glad that I read the book. Hopefully, I'll enjoy some of his other books as well."
2,Disappointed,"As much as I'm in love with the musical (and I know the musical was only loosely based on this book), I was severely disappointed. Not only was the story not what I expected, but I felt very detached from the characters the whole time. I didn't really care what happened to any of them by the end. It also felt like the author went through and used a thesaurus for a lot of the book just to use random (seemingly sophisticated?) vocabulary. It took me (a fast reader with lots of time on my hands due to a part-time job) several weeks to get through this book because I kept falling asleep. I wanted so much more out of this book that I just didn't get."
4,book: Wicked,"I have yet to actually finish this book, however it arrived quickly and on time. The book was worn and showed definite signs for wear and being read, but I bought it used and don't really mind. It is still in good working order."
2,Wicked,Just a very dark and disturbing book. I tried and tried to get into it and forced myself to read but just couldn't get into it.
4,Made People Talk,"I assume that I came into this book with preconceived notions as to what it would be about. I had the 1930s movie in mind and braced myself for a pleasant look into the life of the Wicked Witch of the West.That isn't what I got. I was surprised as I'm sure many readers were at the raw, deep, and sometimes disturbing tone of this book.I applaud the author for taking on this story. He made people talk. Even now, years later, people are still talking about this title. He took a risk, he went out on a limb, and he succeeded in creating a book that people are intrigued with. Whether the reaction of the reader is good or bad, people are talking."
4,Wicked,"A good read before seeing the play. A little ""dark"" but sheds a different light on evil and good referencing the good witch and bad (wicked) witch."
3,Not for young readers,"I got this book because I'm going to see Wicked soon. While it is interesting, this is not for young people. It has quite a bit of sexual explicit material. I am a high school teacher and would not recommend it for anyone under 18. If you are more open with your teenager that is fine but definitely not under 14."
2,Not for Me,I found the sexual references in this book a little too descriptive in this book so I stopped reading it... I think this might be a book just for adults (i'm teen)
2,"Wicked: The Disjointed, Long Winded Saga of the Wicked Witch","I was very excited to receive my copy of ""Wicked..."" in the mail. But, once I started reading, I became quickly disappointed. I am an unsually speedy reader and found myself dragging through this extremely cumbersome text. The story is interesting, but it is bogged down with too many details and disjointed ramblings."
2,I can take it or leave it...,"I saw the musical Wicked in Chicago and absolutely loved it. I immediately went out and bought the book, hoping to see the characters in the musical fleshed out a bit.Instead, I started reading it and was shocked at the explicit scenes. I found myself losing interest. It is not an easy book to read; Maguire uses large words and rambles on instead of explaining.The characters in the book are hard to relate to and sometimes boring. The storyline grew tedious. The only part in this book I truly enjoyed was when Elphaba and her friends were at school. After they left, the book went downhill for me.So many things in this book were left unexplained. I am considering reading the sequel, just to find out what happens, but if I do read it, it will definitely come from the library. I wouldn't buy a book from this author again and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for a heavy read and not looking for something even remotely close to the musical."
5,Yay!,"I definitely loved this book, as well as the musical CD. But I also enjoyed the Adventures With Boys book series as well! ;)"
3,Interesting enough - worth the read overall,"The book is a lot darker than the musical, and actually more engaging in a sense. I love the sense of ""revisionist"" history, and the ""realist"" backdrop that the author creates to set the mood of the book. In this history, Dorothy is but both an incidental, yet critical player -- like that Serb who shot the Archduke of Austria-Hungary. But really, in the grand scheme of things isn't the witch's or the Archduke's background story much more interesting than Dorothy's or that Serb's? However, the storyline itself IS a bit belabored, and the intersection between the witch's world and ours is never adequately explained. So, it was enjoyable overall, but not a can't-put-it-down candidate."
4,Wicked good!,This was a great book! I read it before I saw the play. I loved them both even though they were different in many ways they still most of the same characters and both were brilliantly told. I'm hoping this book gets made into TV series so people can see just how great it is.
5,A Fabulous Concoction,"Starting with only the Oz books and his wonderfully fertile imagination, Gregory Maguire has created a masterpiece."
5,A new meaning to Oz.,"I think this book is prabably the best I have ever read. If you read the Oz books like I do, you will love this book, there are no words describing how good this book is. I am wishing Gregory Maguire would write another one, and if you are reading this Mr. Maguire, I would love if you wrote another one. Trust me you will love this book."
4,The dark side of Oz,"Charming meets alarming. This revisionist look at the Wizard of Oz shows us the tale from the university-educated, broom-riding Witch's point-of-view. Reminds one a bit of Mary Stewart's Merlin series in that it humanizes a mythical, larger-than-life character. Flying monkeys still abound, along with some unsettling descriptions of their origins; and just how much did Dorothy know about the effect of water on the Witch before she emptied that bucket"
2,I wanted to like this book,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It wanted to be profound & thought-provoking as reflected by the silly & pretentious ""study"" questions provided at the back of the book. It ended up being a series of false starts, silly, indecipherable symbolism with an aimless plot.I kept asking myself, ""when is this book going to take off?"" & all it did was taxi. Though amusing at times, generally it was a waste of time."
3,"Not Bad, Just Not For Me","Many of my co-workers rave about ""Wicked"" so I finally decided to check it out for myself. I thought the concept was intriguing. It's well-written and very creative, but very political. I think that's what caught me off guard. I'm not into political drama, even if it's magical political drama."
2,"Long winded, plodding. Blegh.","Short review here: This is the second book I've read by this author (the other book being 'Lost'), who I'm starting to suspect is long winded and boring at parties. Interesting ideas, believable political maneuverings in Oz, but moves wayyyyyyy toooo slowwwww for a story with a known ending. Started skimming about 3/4 through, and it was STILL too plodding. Beg, borrow, or steal it. Don't add it to your library."
2,NOT worth all the hype,"I bought this book in hopes of reading a fun, unique fantasy story to transport me away from reality. However, I soon found myself in a long political rant that barely had ANYTHING to do with the original Wizard of Oz. The book iself it written very well, which is why I gave it two stars, but so much of it was flat out boring. It is very long and as time went on I felt as though I was really dragging myself through. Not to mention there is not much that actually involves Dorothy and the rest of the group associated with the Wizard of Oz. I also found the ""murder"" scene with the water shockingly anti-climactic. There were some clever things and ideas, but this was so filled with politics and other boring stuff that it left me greatly disappoiinted."
2,Don't bother,"This book is pretty bad. The plot is uninteresting and the author changes the events from the Wizard of Oz in order to make his characters work. Unfortunately, they don't work. Worst of all, the author removes the ""magic"" from Oz, literally. Don't waste your time reading this book."
1,Almost didn't finish it,"The book is wordy and weird, the author starts subplots/story lines but doesn't fulfill them in a satisfying way, and she tries to say something about religion and politics but gives a confused message.I finished it, becaue I like to finish what I start."
2,Wicked awful,"I was very disappointed by this book. There are so many reviews stating how amazing the book is. I did not find that to be true. It is fairly boring. The idea is great; it just wasn't presented well. It reminds me of the series LOST in that it adds these odd crazy things along the way for no reason whatsoever. Thing that do not belong in the plot, are never explained, and never come up later. Also, the characters are not developed very well, not even the main one, the Wicked Witch of the West. At the end of the book, I still felt as though I didn't know her very well. The ending also felt rushed and abrupt. On a side not, the musical was great! Skip the book, go to the theatre!"
1,How could such a great show come from such a horrible book?,"I like a lot of people thought that it would be good to read the book after seeing the broadway show - huge mistake. What a piece of crap. I loved the show, but I think the greatest thing about it is that it only took a few names from the book and none of the story. It is sad to me that Maguire gets to be associated in any way with the show. Do not read this, it is not entertaining and I don't know how the show even became based on it. Give the broadway writers credit in taking one of the worst books and changing it into one the greatest shows I have ever seen."
2,Baum Would Bomb This,"This book's premise and opening three sections are undeniably interesting. The Wicked Witch's childhood and foray into college were engrossing to read about. The rest of the book became a thinly-veiled retelling of Hitler's rise to power in Germany and a lecture about how power corrupts and how evil it is to infringe upon the rights of others. Unfortunately, the main character is largely devoid of personality, and Maguire doesn't have the ability to lure the reader into the fantasy of Oz.This book is a critic's darling, but I don't think it would win the People's Choice."
2,I wish it was better,"Several friends strongly recommended I read this book, certain I'd be crazy about it. I'm not. While the plot shows a lot of originality and craftmanship, and the themes are rich, Maguire doesn't have much insight into these characters or wisdom about these themes. It is a plot-driven novel, all of the characters are flat. In other words, Maguire plotted a course from point A to point B, connected the dots, and no character changes along the way. I didn't stop once to ponder what this artist was saying about life. I spent no time apart from the book, processing the knowledge that is being imparted. It's entertaining, but for me, what makes a novel worth the hours spent reading it is a unique insight into the ways of the world. This book is bone dry in that regard, and leaves you hungry for a Nobel prize candidate or winner."
4,Required for an OZ fan!,"Being an OZ fan (I believe I've read thirteen of the fourteen OZ books written by Baum), the moment I saw Gregory Maguire's ""Wicked"" at a bookstore I knew I had to purchase it. Wicked's premise is this: what if the Wicked Witch of the West wasn't really so wicked and OZ wasn't as idyllic as it seemed? And what if the Wizard of OZ, in addition to being a fraud, was also a tyrant? Just what would happen to someone who joined a resistance movement against the Wizard? I found this novel interesting, although the first fifty pages contained what I considered gratuitous sexual content; stories of Elphaba's mother's sexual trysts with strangers didn't bring anything to the book, in my opinion, nor did portraying Munchkinlanders as sex-crazed heathens.Still, this book comes highly recommended from a self-confessed OZ and fantasy fan."
3,Disenchanted with Wicked,"I can't say I was really looking forward to reading Wicked. Could be because I stumbled in late after all the hype. But I can honestly say I didn't miss much. This story didn't take off very fast. Character development was slow. In fact by almost the end of the book I discovered I had no attachment to them whatsoever. Can you say distant? Emotionless?Worldbuilding as a whole was pretty decent, but I wasn't boiled over or enchanted."
3,Don't expect the musical,"I bought this book because I'd just seen Wicked (the musical) and wanted to know more of the story. I don't know who wrote the musical, but it's not really based on this particular book at all! This book is very interesting though: interesting characters and political subplot. BUT, I can't give it more than 3 stars because I was looking for more ""musical"" and less ""political lecture"". And it didn't even have a happy ending!!!!"
1,Don't Read if you liked the land of Oz!,"If you have read the Oz books and not just seen the movie, this book will be a severe disappointment. At no point is he true to the concept of Oz as written by L. Frank Baum. While I was intrigued by the ""alternative"" viewpoint, I have been VERY disappointed in Wicked. I will not be buying any more books in this series. If he had to write this story, I would have preferred he created his own land rather than trying to milk the Oz franchise. On its own, the book would not have made any impact without the cheap and completely erroneous tie-in."
5,...a wicked feast of language and allegory.,"So, you thought you knew the story of Oz.Maguire gives a whole new spin on the classic L. Frank Baum story. From the Wicked Witch of the West's childhood as an obvious outsider, to her school days which shape her ideals, to her time as a visionary, fighting for Animal rights. The story introduces you to Elphaba's one great love and her later years as an outcast. Maguire paints the picture of a woman torn by her passions and her ethics. It will leave you asking yourself to define just what is wicked?A gripping story that kept me flipping the pages."
2,Wickedly Missing in Depth,"The author had a pheonominal opportunity to do so much with this story, but never took advantage of it.The story focuses on the birth, life, and death of the Wicked Witch. The author does give her more of a three dimensional outlook instead of the cackling green monster in the Wizard of Oz. However, the story is very slow to start and then goes no where. Frequently, the story started to go in one direction and then the author abandoned it and started in a new direction. The witch's quest for the shoes was greatly down played, as was there significance. Moreover, the granduer of Oz was barely touched on.I was hugely disappointed in the book and had expected so much more considering there was so much more the author could have done."
2,Not what I expected,"I saw ""Wicked"" on Broadway and borrowed my roommate's paperback just to see how much better it would be compared to the musical. Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed. Maguire's style of writing dragged on and needed to pick up the pace on some parts of the story. I loved the adult themes of sex, racism, and discrimination but it could've been written better."
5,What an Escape,"I received the book Wicked for Christmas in 1998, and once I started reading it I could not put it down. I thought Maguire's use of tone, plot, and imagery was very well thought out. Reading this book allowed me to escape from reality for awhile and get lost in a wonderful fictional world. As an English major I thought this was a very well written book. I would encourage anyone who is looking for a good fiction book to consider purchasing this one."
4,"Couldn't put it down, except...","A rich, colorful and imaginative version of the Wicked Witch we grew up with. I couldn't put it down. It's a Harry Potter for adults -- unfortunately for adults only because of an unnecessarily pornographic section involving sex between, well never mind. Aside from the bestiality, a great read right to the end, where the plot veers awkwardly to fit the story we know. Tear out the study questions at the back of the book. They are annoying."
1,save your time and money,"Mired in belabored plot lines that go nowhere and in self important themes. I won't even be donating this book. If I could, I would give it no stars."
4,You'll never look at Dorothy the same way again,"Enchantingly original. It turns out that the ""wicked"" witch is the most interesting, misunderstood person in Oz, and learning how she got that way includes a journey through the nature of good and evil and a reinterpretation of a story we all thought we already knew."
2,Not my favorite,"I wanted to know the full story behind the broadway musical ... I was sadly disappointed with the profanity and certain language usage... I was able to understand more of the ""full story"" behind the musical... but I didn't enjoy the book."
3,This is not your mother's Oz,"I just finished this book. It was a strange journey. I wasn't sure I liked it at first. Then I was interested enough I wanted to keep reading. The way the end played out I thought was a little bogus. But I thought it was an interesting read on the Wizard of Oz world. Some things did make me think about present life in the US. I didn't like that some things went unexplained or were just too bizarre to ""get."" Maybe Cliffs Notes would help with some of the other layers of meaning behind the story."
2,Thank goodness I borrowed this....,"Like others, I decided to read this book due to all the hype. However, I had thumbed throught it at the bookstore and wasn't fully convinced I would like it, so I borrowed it from a friend. Smart move.While the beginning of the book is somewhat engaging, when Maguire does the first leap of time (and not the last) from Elphaba's childhood to her being in a young lady's school, the plot starts to unravel. Macguire seems to think using sophisticated grammar along with sophisticated ideas constitutes character development. But, as with other readers, I hardly connected with any of the characters and with least of all the main character.I knew how the book would end, but I didn't realize how badly. It almost seemed as if Maguire was up against an editor's timeline and stayed up all night to finish the end. It's disjointed, disengaging and disappointing.Too bad, it was a plot that could of proved extremely interesting had the execution been right."
3,Childish whimsy and dark themes weren't my cup of tea,"I read this book at the encouragement of friends but found myself a bit disappointed. The strange blend of childish whimsy and mature, dark themes put me off. Though the book is remarkably well written, it tends to drag in certain sections. In general, I thought that the witch just wasn't wicked enough. She goes through a lot in the course of the book, but you don't really see the impact of things on her except for in sudden and drastic changes that disconnected me from the story. It is worth the read because it offers an interesting perspective on a story nearly everyone is familiar with."
3,Wicked?,"First off, I've never read Baum's books, so I was just comparing this book to the movie version. The book had a lot of political and religious concepts that I didn't fully grasp, but found interesting anyway. I expected this story to just be the Witch's perspective on the whole story...and it was, but Dorothy and the gang didn't even show up until page 332 out of a 406 page book. Overall, it was a little hard to get into, but it picked up, and was a fairly interesting read."
4,Wickedly funny and entertaining,"I found this to be an exciting and thought provoking new version of an old tale. The wicked witch wasn't evil, she was just highly misunderstood!! I liked the fact that she was given a background and a family that was visible! Excellent read with many underlying themes. GREAT BOOK!!"
4,Good Book,"If you are a Wizard of Oz fan then you will love this book. It is not a quick read. There are a lot of details and a lot of thinking needs to take place to have a good visual of this book.It is, in its own way, very political. Sexual content. Unfortunate and not necessary. I would have loved my 14 year old daughter to read it, but it is not appropriate. It is clealy an adult book. Wish there was an edited version."
2,Fun Idea. Boring book.,"I love the idea behind this book. What a great idea to recreate the story of the mean, green witch most of us know so well. Or do we? (My sister, during one summer vacation, watched the Wizard of OZ Every. Single. Day. I wasn't pleased.)At first I was intrigued. It was riveting reading about this well known character's other side. The Wicked Witch of the West's early life? Do go on.But once Maguire went into heavy, in-depth details of her political ideas, and alliances, I found myself trapped in the Not So Wonderful World of Yawn.Perhaps this book is more interesting to the OZ obsessed. Others, proceed with caution."
1,Not worth your time!,"I am a fiction and fantasy fan, but I did not like this book at all! With all of the book options that are out now, I would encourage you to not waste your time. Read something else."
2,"Good Book,But someone colored the outside pages GREEN thank you booksany","i recieved this book today, right now actully, and its in great condition but the outside pages are green i know someone colored it because on the front of the book is a green marker mark and its the same color and the green on the pages this was not in the descriptioon i only gave it 2stars for that so thanks booksany............."
4,Enchanting and Challenging Book,"This book definitely makes one wonder of the true nature of evil, and the credibility of a polarized view of the world (black versus white, good versus bad). A creative and demanding endeavor this book must have been to write, and the author creates his fantasy world with much finesse. The only thing that truly disappointed me was one especially graphic ""sex scene""- that I still cannot figure out its relevance whatsoever! Aside from this one misstep, I recommend it heartily."
2,Not a favorite...,"I really didn't like this book; I couldn't even get into the book until about half way through it (if not longer). Although the ending was pretty philosophical and overall pretty good, I really didn't think it was worth of the monotonous reading to get there. I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,Wicked!!!,"Loved the book... since my childhood I couldn't watch ""The Wizard of Oz"" as the Wicked Witch of the West scared the bejeesus out of me. It was good to read a book that explained her history and reasons for being obsessed with the Ruby Slippers. My only disappointment with the book (and I'm not giving anything away as we all know she dies)is that her final fate happened so quickly. Maguire has written an excellent book that has made me look at the character in a different light... who knows maybe next time I see the film I won't be hiding behind the sofa!!!"
2,Not a summer read,"I am reading this as a book club suggestion. While fantasy is not my usual genre, I am willing to read it for discussion purposes. I find it to be very ""drawn out"". For those who enjoy this genre it might be an enjoyable read; for me, I find it to be one that I must finish and will be glad to have accomplished it."
3,Difficult Reading,"Although the concept of this book is genius and the story is intricately weaved to set the pace of ""The Wizard of Oz"", it is difficult to read. The author does not develop his concepts thoroughly. I found myself frequently re-reading areas to better understand why certain events were taking place. It reads in certainparts like Shakespeare and requires assumption of facts in others.Although the author came up with a brilliant idea that uses concepts that twist what we have always assumed about ""The Wizard of Oz"", he would have done better to let someone else write his ideas so that thea reader could etter follow his storyline and understand it."
3,Could have been better,"I really liked the basis of this story. I thought that the whole idea was intriguing. However I never can get around sexual swear words when there is no need. This book had been called an instant classic but I feel it could never be that when sexual encounters are described in such crude language. It's obvious the author is trying to be edgy so he thinks a few ""f"" bombs will do the trick. I'm not sure I recommend this book but I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoyed it somewhat."
2,I tried to finish this book...but I couldn't get into it.,"A friend recommended this book. They said it was funny. I got halfway through this book and kept waiting for the story to take a turn and take off. But each time I picked it up I felt like I was just trying to finish it, not really enjoying it. Finally a friend of mine asked why didn't I just start reading something else. So I did. I sold this at a used book store and picked up a few others. Granted I had just finished two amazing books that were full of suspense and I couldn't wait to pick them up again. With this book, halfway through it, I was still bored."
3,A Magnificently Intelligent Read,"This book tickled my imagination,improved my vocabulary, and interfered with my housework!"
2,Buy the soundtrack not the book,"First I have to say that Gregory Maguire has a beautiful command with the English language. Overall the thing I enjoyed most about this book was his use of words and bringing things to life with them. However that was the only thing I enjoyed about this book. If you are reading this because you love the musical or the original novels, be careful and know that this book has very little in common with either. In fact I felt that this book betrayed L. Frank Baum original characters and his fantasy world of OZ. I kept waiting and reading hoping I would love this book as I loved the musical, as I loved the original books, unfortunately I felt it was just an excuse to get out some religious and political ideas the author had probably been thinking about for years. It had such potential and fell short. If you like the idea of the story spend your money on the soundtrack of the musical by the same name. That is worth your money!"
2,Classics don't always breed classics...,"I'm only on chapter 4 but I have to say, this is one of those cases when I think the musical (which I want to see but haven't BTW) has to be better than the story it is based off of.I mean, while the story is meant to be different, and I know elements of the OZ books are dark (I've read pretty much all of the real OZ series, which has much more depth than the movies) I just don't think Wicked stays true to the written 'authors tone' of OZ.If it was written in a more sort of 'talking to the reader' way I think I would be able to take it more seriously (I thought it was going to be written in 1st person when I bought it as well) but because it is so 'out there' and on top of it doesn't connect with the reader I think it falls flat many times."
2,Overated POS,Ultimately goes nowhere. Characters where developed become vague. Supposedly questions the nature of evil. Mainly an exercise in marketing gimmickry. Total waste of time.
2,"Politics, good and evil, fantasy, pulp fiction????","Political satire, meditation on the nature of good and evil, fanatsy novel, pulp fiction? Intriguing concept, miserable execution."
3,Interesting Observation...,"I saw this book and a couple of others on the shelves of a local used bookstore and thought I'd check out the reviews here before making the purchase. I usually sort all the readers reviews from worst to best since the worst reviews better enable me to size up the book's overall content quality. That's when I noticed an interesting trend in these reviews: The book reviews go back about 10 years, with 141 1-star ratings to-date. Over 55% (78) of those 1-star reviews were written within a year from today, and nearly 30% (42 reviews) were written in '06 alone.I realize this may be purely a coincidence, but I noticed the exact same trend for the other two books as well. They were published 4 and 6 years ago respectively. Whasupwitdat?"
3,Great Libreto for a musical,"Very original idea, that wears thin. The book is OK, but really can't Maguire make up his own charecters, instead of hijacking someone else's? The followups in the same genre are just criminal."
2,Wickedly boring,"I had heard so much about this book and I was so eager to read it. 100 pages in, and I seriously began to question whether something was wrong with me. I was painfully disappointed with this book. It is slow and plodding.Some hail it as a masterpiece, but I kept waiting for the book to pick up and get better. It never did. Perhaps this book was too philosophical and political for me. I really didn't care about the plight of the sentient Animals. I read this book because I was expecting and entertaining read. I was very disappointed. No doubt all of you reading this review will say my review was not helpful. But like Elphaba, I dare to be different. This is my honest feeling and I will not conform. I am not ashamed of my green skin and make no excuses for it."
3,Somehow Lost in Oz,"Wicked, when I first read it seem interesting concept enough. The life of the WICKED WITCH of the West, which is supposedly born evil. Though the book's concept is to question the whole point of what is good and what is evil or what Evil really is. Though it got the point slowly across I still felt it wasn't really Oz. I must say it's an adult book with adult characters and adult situations. Which can make you feel, well I'm reading a more perplexed version of what I live now. Anyhow at points it was really interesting and I enjoyed those pages. At other times I felt I was reading just to get to the next page. By the time it ends I felt like oh well it ended, not so much, I really wished I wasn't in the end feeling. It's complete story and plot. But for me it felt like someone made you your favorite cup of tea wrong. As if it was missing and ingredient or just didn't have enough of one."
2,A fairy tale based on the Wizard of Oz,"This book has absolutely nothing to do with Wicca or witchcraft. It is the writers opinion of The Wizard of Oz. Very stupid, and out of date."
2,Intriguing,"First of all, I am obsessed with the Broadway Production of Wicked. The story line is unbelievable not to mention the songs. The book was the influence on the play, and I felt like they only used the idea of the Wicked book, not the plot or characters. I was dissapointed in this book because it just wasn't a good story. But I stuck with it because I enjoyed reading the book that started it all and learning about Elpahba's life that the play skipped over. I would only recommend this book to people who adore the play like myself and are interested in seeing the sad truth of Elphaba's life."
3,"Once they leave Shiz, it's all downhill...","I enjoyed the first part of the book, which was interesting and evocative though certainly *not for children*. As others have noted, the second half of the book is entirely disappointing.My chief complain about the book is that the protagonist (anti-heroine or whatever) never really *does* anything. She is a chronic victim of circumstance. Everything she tries ends in failure. Why call Elphaba ""Wicked?"" She's really closer to ""Pathetic.""Is this supposed to be an investigation into the nature of evil? I recall Paul Reiser being interviewed after appearing in the movie ""Aliens.""Jay Leno asked him, ""Are you the villain in the movie?""""No,"" he replied, ""I'm the misunderstood character in the movie."""
2,Too Bad...,"I loved the ""idea"" of this book, and after trudging through the beginning, was finally pulled along by some really clever writing...but man o man after ""Shiz,"" it was sluggish and I, unlike the reader who didn't want it to end, could not believe I was still turning pages and the damned thing wouldn't! The same story could have been written in half the words. And it could have been tighter. We still never understood who exactly Yackle was, whether Grommetik murdered the Goat, if Fiyero was still alive. And we were left in the cold with undeveloped characters like Nor and Liir and even Glinda. There were so many questions and allusions that kept me reading in hopes of some resolution, long after I was ready to call it quits. But they were never answered! In sum, this story was like a sieve, the good and the bad all mixed together but in the end falling through the holes like so much sand."
2,Wish this Wicked Story Was Better,What a great book this could have really been. It was slow in many parts and included a sex part toward the start that did not really need to be there. Didn't like the ending. Much more could have been explored with this book. Not sure if I'll read the Step-sisters. Would not encourage anyone under 15 to read because of the sexual tones and that age could even be raised.
1,Don't waste your money.,"After seeing the incredible production of ""Wicked"" (the musical) I purchased the book. The book is dark, disturbingly graphic and nothing like the musical. Frankly, I only got through the first chapter. Loved the musical, hated the book."
2,Boring,"This book was slightly disturbing but mostly boring - I must confess, I only got through about half of it before I decided to put myself out of my mysery and abandon it."
1,Wasnt that impressed,I really was not impressed with this book. The idea is wonderful and I like seeing the wicked witch in new light. SOme of the stuff that was added however was not needed. It would have been even better without it. I dont think the original author of the Oz stories would be impressed with what he turned his book into.
3,Worth it for the first half?,"I was sold on this book for the first half or so -- I loved the lush language used to narrate the story, the characters (especially Elphaba) appeared real and dynamic and I was invested in them, totally drawn into the various narrative lines Maguire was spinning out. But then, somewhere in the second half of the book, things fell apart -- characters remained undeveloped, plot lines just dropped, and I was worried a book I'd been formerly so invested in was going to turn out to be anticlimactic. The end confirmed my fear -- so many interesting characters/plot lines/ideas were never touched on again, and I was left frustrated and unsatisfied. The book's worth a read, for sure, but I wish I'd been warned about how little the loose ends were going to be tied up."
3,"Enigmas, akimbo, and snares, Oh My!","I liked the book because of its originality.However, the story would flow and then get stuck in its attempt to confuse and irritate the reader into skipping over big parts of the book.The journey of the Witch is so convoluted, that I had to back track. Enjoying this book took a lot effort. I like to be entertained when I read fiction, not work myself into a dither trying to understand where the story is going. When it gets bogged down with theories and who is who and where and when,...it is rather boring. BUT.. the parts that tell you about her childhood, schooling...is entertaining."
1,Disappointing,"The idea of a story about the Wicked Witch of the West was exciting, intriguing. I bought the book with anticipation of an original fantasy spinning from a familiar one. But from page one it seems this author needed a venue for his sexual appetite and has tortured this idea with his eroticism and cynicism. While I could have endured a satire (his themes were interesting), I was not interested in soft porn.His use of language is fantastic. The themes he introduces are definitely food for thought. If only he could have left the excessive innuendos and gratuitous sex scenes out, I think I would have really enjoyed this novel. As it is, I find myself slogging through because I never leave a book unfinished. If your curiousity compels you to read it, I recommend going to the library instead of wasting good money on it. Then, if you disagree with me, you can purchase it for your collection. It doesn't even begin to compare to Tolkein, BTW."
1,One of the all time worst books,"I was so excited to read this book after learning about the premise. Once I started it, I was really disappointed. I could not finish this book. I was bored out of my mind! I finally flipped ahead to see if it got any better, but figured there were way too many excellent books out there to waste my time further with this piece of garbage. Believe me, I am being generous with the 1 star rating!!"
1,Read a different book!,"I finally finished the book and I thought giving birth to my children was easier than reading this book. There are plenty of authors who create worlds, civilizations, and characters that are so much more vivid and compelling than the ones created in this book. Was it a comment on politics or religions or WHAT?When I started the book, I thought it was strange, but I kept trying to be open-minded. So I read about the animals, Animals, the Unnamed God, Lurlina, the Kumbric Witch, Tik Tok religion, the Wizard, the Grimmerie, and the shoes. You are probably asking, ""What does all of that mean?"". Guess what, I am asking the same question and I read the book! I was waiting for all of these pieces and many more to be explained. Sadly,they were not. It felt like I put together a puzzle only to find out that the last few pieces are missing. This book was a HUGE disappointment."
2,Highly disappointing,"I was quite prepared to fall in love with this book, and predisposed to patiently follow the dense, somewhat emotionally detached prose in the hope that there would be some kind of epiphany, a moment when I would unlock the deeper meaning behind so much of the mystery in Wicked. It never came. I found this book to be much ado about nothing. I had the sense of sitting through an undergraduate philosophy seminar where 20-year-olds spin theories of about truth and ethics without understanding anything deeper about life or themselves. In the end, I knew Elphaba only slightly better than I did after the first 100 pages, and Glinda, the Wizard, Madam Morrible, and the host of other intriguing characters never really achieved any depth. I'll be seeing the musical in a few months and I have a feeling this is the very rare case when the derivative work will be more satisfying than the original literature."
2,Dont know what all the hubub was all about,"I bought this book since everyone is talking about and saying how good it was. It was terrible. The only thing that kept me reading was I thought it must all come together in the end so good to make up for the rest. I felt like entire sections of the story are missing -- it jumps, with no assist, from time to much later in time. People change and there is no lead up to what made the change or poof in half a sentence all was different. I did not find anything I could say would make this book worth reading."
3,Interesting read,"This book is very interesting, how every it is, at times, somewhat disturbing. Overall it is very odd, which is to be expected. When I finished it I could barely remember everything that happened because of all the odd characters with odd names. Very little time was devoted to developing any of the characters and Elphaba seems rather shallow and self centered.In spite of all of that it was enjoyable. However, do not expect this to be like the musical, they are very differant."
1,Not up to expectation,I read the intro and thought this book had so many possiblities but did not live up to them. The story got dull and jumped around a lot.It started out good but was a let down from there.
2,Hard to get into,"The book was is a let down, because you are excepting one thing and getting another.The main problem I had with this book was the author didn't set up the chapters. The title said one thing and you end up reading about something complete different and for me this was the reason the book was so dry.It wasn't until the fiftieth chapter did I start getting into it and that because I was really trying. The author also jumps back and forth on topics that you can't keep up, it almost enough to make your head spin. The only to really understand this book is if you know something of the ""Wizard of Oz"" besides the movie."
1,NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK!,"This story begins with too much vulgarity and distastefulness for me. After putting it down several times, I finally closed the book having read only 40 pages and said, ""that is enough."" The writing is demented and demoralizing. My message to everyone: CHILDREN SHOULD NOT READ THIS BOOK! It is an adult story. Do not be fooled by the cover or the title. Personally, I think all copies should be burned at the stake."
1,"Great idea, poorly written","I don't see how this book has so much praise and hype. Yes, the story is a clever take on a classic, but it's so badly written that the book is almost painful to read. By the end of the book I hated the characters and the plot left me cold. If you're used to good fantasy books like the ""His Dark Materials"" series or ""Earthsea"" then you'll be very disappointed."
3,A Slog through Oz,"Wicked is broken up into five sections. The final one is splendid; the others, a bit of a slog. The prose is wondrous; Elphaba makes a great, complicated heroine; and I admire the way Maguire has expanded Baum's skeletal Oz into a rich, detailed fantasy world all its own ... but I was often bored an impatient reading this book. There was not enough action or forward motion, and I was often left confused as to what philosophical truth about good and evil was being expounded. Occasionally the novel was very funny, it was always intelligent, and the finale, though expected, was thrilling and heart-wrenching, but in the end the book takes itself a little too seriously. Fans of literary fiction may love it. I wanted to, but couldn't."
1,Sorry I read it!,"I couldn't have liked this book less. Verbose and boring. Now I'm afraid to see the show, but I've heard it's a far cry from the book. Here's to hoping."
4,Clever!,"The author takes a classic story that most are familiar with and puts an interesting twist to it.I found myself sympathetic to the ""Wicked Witch"" and found a few political meanings in this book as well. The plot is well-developed and leads beautifully into the sequel.If you enjoy new takes on classic characters, you will enjoy this book. My only complaint is his use of language, which I found to be a bit archaic. But otherwise, I enjoyed every minute of reading this book."
5,Brittany S. a good read,"I thought that this book was really good. It used a lot of description when talking about the characters, especally Elphaba. It is a good read for people who want to know what happened before Dorthey came and even for instance why the wicked witch of the west wanted her sister's shoes. I loved how it explained who each of the characters in the wizard of oz (like the scarecrow, tin man...) were. I also liked how in the end of the book everything went together like a puzzle. The author went back into the book and explained some of the events that were harder to understand. I wouldn't recommend this book to younger readers because of some of the explicate text and cursing, though the author did a very good job on figuring out where to cut that off."
5,Read this book now!!!,"I absolutely loved this book. It is a fast paced, easy read. Fascinating and often hilarious characters, fantastic plot. I had never been a fan of the Wizard of Oz, but Maguire's retelling opens up an entirely different world. This is the ultimate antihero, underdog book. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to dive into their imagination and explore the possibility of a so-called-villian being the protagonist. I plan to read it again (as soon as I'm done lending it to everyone I know!). For goodness' sake, read this book!"
4,A different take on Oz,"Initially, I took great umbrage with those who criticized this book. But after reading it, and enjoying it, I have to say that it is certainly not or everyone. There were indeed times where I wanted to jump many pages ahead. The first segment about Elphaba's childhood is outstanding. But if the reader jumps ahead in the middle, though I was tempted, there's always something important you'll miss. I would call this a great ""adult"" take about the land of Oz and a wicked witch that draws sympathies through good intentions gone bad. Perhaps the saying 'No good deed goes unpunished' rings true. This is not a book for children and not a book for the easily distracted, who don't enjoy a long read. Personally, I enjoyed it immensely and was glad that I bought it."
1,Not what I expected,"This book was extremely difficult to get through. It's dark, demented, and twisted. I chose it for the Book Club I'm hosting this time around and none of the other members liked it either. I have one word for this book....disappointing."
2,Huge disappointment,"After seeing Wicked on Broadway, could not wait to read the original. After all, books are always so much better then movies or plays. Always! Not this time. What a disappointment. Story line moved like a snail, irrelevant sexual content, just plain stupid connectivity of some story parts. Get the idea? Hated it. Would give it 1 star, but have to give some credit for originality."
5,Fun!,"This was a fun novel. I confess to becoming interested in it because I enjoyed the musical and thought the book would be interesting. It was, even though of course - duh - it was nothing like the musical in most senses of the word. What was interesting was the merger of GM's imagination with L. Frank Baum's. I have not read the full list of Baum's Oz books but now am curious to see how well they fit with GM's - it looks like it could be a very complicated puzzle. And then there is the political aspect of both sets of books - sets since there are others finished and being finished by GM - and it becomes a major enterprise trying to parse them out and seeing their relationships to contemporary politics and justice. Who is an Animal? Are the Unionists Protestants? One thing for sure is that the musical took quite a lot of liberties with the text. The relationship between Elphaba and Glenda are central to the musical but relatively peripheral in the text. Fun!"
2,Disappointed,"I went to the play earlier this year and loved it. I read the book because of the play. I was very disappointed about the language. Portions of the story were too slow and seemed to take a long time to come to a point that I became bored. Other portions used descriptions that were almost too difficult to decifer that I ended up skimming through. As I read this book, I couldn't help but feel that there was a book before this that I had missed as I felt lost through some of the ideas of the story."
3,Another Side of Things,"I got this book for my birthday, and, frankly, I was greatly disturbed by the way the author turned the charming story of The Wizard of Oz to a book of sex, language, and violence. Even as a child, I pitied the Wicked Witch, and this book was very creative and had originality, but I could not get over the way it turned the story of Oz into a book with so much language, and so much sex. I appreciate the different aspect it offered of the Wicked Witch, and the way it gave a different side of the story, so kudos for that. I don't love the book, but I respect it for its general idea."
4,"Original, witty but very different from the popular musical","I saw a stage production of WICKED before reading the book. The musical had surprised me with its unique, clever spin on the classic L. Frank Baum story made into a phenominon by the 1939 movie version, so I was interested to see this source material.Maguire has done a Herculean task in concocting this detailed story that is so innovative and yet intricately tied to the Baum series. The details and politicizing eventually slow down the storytelling in third quarter of the book, but rejuvenates in time for the climax. But make no mistake, this is a very different & more adult version of Elphaba's life story than bounces across the Broadway stage."
3,Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (Musical Tie-in Edition),Decent book different that what I imagined it being.
2,"Great Premise, Great Promise, Needs Prose","I saw the musical first. Loved it! I received the book as a Christmas gift and was excited to dive into it. I was unfortunately disappointed.The premise is great. But the characters, the character development, and the writing are flat and uninviting. I found myself getting bored, not looking forward to what came next and, overall, disappointed. Maybe I started in with expectations that were too high?But, the musical is great."
4,"Elpheba, Galinda and Nessarose-- oh my!","I've long been a huge fan of the Oz books and (to a lesser degree) of the film. I have to admit that despite all the enthusiastic reviews, I was a little bit dubious about reading Wicked. There have been other attempts to retell the Oz books in the past, and none of them have been terribly successful.I have to say that I liked Wicked far more than I had ever expected. I found it rich and full smart, sharp moments. I liked the way that the Baum details shone through and were reworked into this new, more realistic world. It managed to be satirical without hitting the reader over the head and moving without being cheap, at least most of the time.My only real quarrel was that I felt like it started to drag after Nessarose and Elpheba are reunited. I never really bought Elpheba's character changes towards the end, although I understood (I think) why they were necessary. This said, these were pretty minor flaws and should not dissuade the prospective reader."
1,I can't imagine why anyone would want to read this book!,"I bought this book cause it was chosen by a book club member for us all to read. I am 3/4 of the way through this book. I have hated it from the first chapter I read. I still don't like the book, but did become at least readable around page 360. Can't wait to be finished with this book. The names are so hard to pronounce, lots & lots of words that I have no clue what their meaning is, and who wants to look up that many words in the dictionary. I will be throwing this book in a fire & burning it when I am finished. What a waste of a lot of my time."
5,Loved it!,This is a light entertaining read for adults. It is fun and clever. I needed a mind candy treat at the end of the day and this was perfect.
3,Depends on your comfort level...,"Baby biting herself, sex, drugs, and evil... Not my idea of a great book but I have to say that that the author writes well and has a very vivid imagination. This twisted book really takes a close look at the story before we all meet the wizard in Oz. I tend to read books that I find are beneficial to me and I found this one uncomfortable and didn't finish it because of that. Those of you out there who are into pushing the limits will probably love this book. Enjoy!"
2,falls way short of its potential,"This book is a great idea, but instead it gets bogged down in preaching about good and evil and loses track of the story."
5,A Wicked Book and Author,"This is the story of Elphaba, or rather, the Wicked Witch of the West. I bought this book along with Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister ten minutes after I had seen the Steven Scwarts Musical Version of the book in San Fransisco. I finished over 60 pages in one day, I was so enthralled. This book has beautifull writing, and characters, and a plot to any true Wizard of Oz Fan. I would also reccomend reading the book, rather than watching the movie. MacGuire creates the Witch as a person, with problems just like everyone else and shows how she slowly becomes ""Wicked""...if she really does though...that's your descision."
2,Very disappointing.,"Being the type of person who enjoys watching the Wicked Witch of the West melt in slow motion, I thought this book would be an interesting read. It was, until I got past the first chapter on the future witch's childhood. From then on, this book became a chore to finish. It doesn't even know what type of book it wants to be: tongue and cheek, serious, political or sexual. All of these elements are thrown in for good measure. Strange dialogue and silly plot twists persist throughout the book. The horrible throw-away ending only added to my regret at not putting the book down when our heroine was sharing a room with Glinda (the soon to be Good Witch of the North,) in college. (Really.) Don't be fooled by the premise of the book, which appears to have great promise. That promise is not fulfilled. To each his own, but I'm at a loss to understand how anyone could have given this book five stars."
2,In the FOR SALE pile,"Way too long and nothing really happens. I really hope that the point of the story wasn't to show that the shoes were why Elphaba was evil. In the book, I enjoyed her character immensely. In spite of her political views on animals and whatnot. I wouldn't read it again because it didn't answer any questions in a creative way like I thought it would."
2,wicked,sorry the book left too many unanswered questionsfor me. and i we didnt get to identify with el to the endeveryone else only played bit parts and she seemed to belooking in on the story from the outside...
3,Wasted Opportunity,"I picked up this book because the idea of telling this story from the Witch's point of view was brilliant. It intrigued me.I am a little disappointed though. The first half of the book was great...interesting, captivating, everything. But the letdown comes with the conclusion.Maguire decided to re-write the ending of this story. I think that's a huge mistake. He's basically saying ""this is the way it happened."" Well, I'm sorry, but that's not the way it happened.With all the things that happen to Elphaba, she could have easily turned completely evil. I wish he'd have taken that approach. Turned Elphaba into a complete monster just like she was in the original. We as readers, would still sympathize with her as we would understand all the hell she went through.To me, this would have been a more appropriate ending. Unfortunately, I have left this book slightly disappointed. It is still a good read though, and I recommend it to any OZ fan."
1,Not so great,"Creative, but disenchanting- The quality of the writing is disappointing and the text is often unnecessarily vulgar, not to mention lewd. I stopped reading after the 4th chapter. Definitely not intended for young readers."
2,Lost its way after a strong start,"The first half of the book is wonderful, but then loses its way. The author's discourses on good and evil, his preaching about animal rights, religion, and so on become tedious. The story stalls and doesn't recover. The final third is a rush to shoe-horn the Wizard of Oz ending onto the story, and it just doesn't work. It became a chore to read."
3,A book to make me long for a rating system for literature,"I just finished ""Wicked"". Buried deep within the prose is a pretty good story of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, and how she got the title. A caricature becomes a character, one for whom I felt empathy by the end.Be forewarned. If you're expecting ""Wicked"" to be a retelling of the events of ""The Wizard of Oz"", it's not. Dorothy's house doesn't land on Nessarose until the book is 80% over. This is Elphaba's story from birth to death.I am irritated that Mr. Maguire confuses ""adult"" with ""profane"". It seems a given today that authors ""prove"" they're writing for adults by throwing in gratuitous profanity (at least one ""F""-word and multiple others). And, I'd like to know how descriptions of defecation and urination add to the story? Natural acts? Certainly, but a decent editor would have excised these incidents and it wouldn't have harmed Elphaba's story.This is the type of book for which libraries were made. Borrow it, don't buy it."
2,Too graphic,"Having listened the the Wicked Musical soundtrack I was excited to read the book. Though I was quickly drawn into the plot, I was disappointed with material I found offensive. I know that offensiveness is subjective--but within the first 50 pages Elpheba's mother has slept with 3 different men and in addition, a sexually perverse scene was described. It was more ""wickedness"" than I wanted to read about, and so I stopped. If you are sensitive to such things you may want to stop as well."
1,Wicked awful,"I had heard a lot about Wicked the book and musical and thought I would try the book. I found the content and the characters to be more grotesque and gross than wicked. The plot and setting skipped around a lot, and it lacked what they call ""continuity"" in film. For example, way into the book, suddenly there are Animals and animals, the first of which talk, wear clothes and hold jobs. They should have been introduced earlier. I stopped reading around there."
1,Not worth your time.,"Now that I have finished the series, I can strongly recommend that you do not waste your time reading this book. The Broadway Musical was excellent and is certainly worth your time, but this book and the series are completely other than the musical. This book has tons of loose ends that never get tied up anywhere in the other 3 books. If you want a satisfying literary experience, I would recommend reading just about anything else."
1,Wicked Paperback Book,I am completely disappointed in this paperback book. It was described as a brand new book but has bent pages and looks worn and used. I am certain it has been used. I felt completely mislead.
3,Could have been worse,"This book had a brilliant premise, but fell dramatically short of my expectations. From the previously posted reviews, I had expected an excellent read at best, and a controversial read at worst. This book was neither. The main character was wooden, and many of the other characters fell flat. The three best characters in the book were Dr. Dillamond, Glinda, and Boq, respectively, and these characters did not play an important enough part in the book to carry it through. The political drama was boring, and although I feel sure that some point was being made, I have no idea what it was or why it was important. The saving graces in this novel are the premise and the language, which is beautiful. The writing style,itself, was excellent, so I haven't given up hope. I still plan on reading ""Confessions."" I've heard that it is less convoluted. Overall, I would suggest checking this book out of the library if you must read it. Save your twenty bucks for something better."
2,What a let down,"The premise for this book is SUCH agreat idea. I just wish Maguire would have given it to someone who could write. I SO wanted this to be a good book, that I too read it in a couple days, constantly expecting it to get better. It never did. In fact the ending is the most disappointing thing about the book. Maguire goes into great detail and develops numerous characters which he then abandons or fails to connect to the story in any way. Hopefully someone in Hollywood will pick this up and turn it into a decent movie; like they did with the original."
4,thought-provoking,this is a book for people who like a story that encourages you to think. very good.
2,"Tedious, Boring, Not in the least bit entertaining.","I kept waiting for something intresting to happen to these characters. To see something that would keep me coming back to the book. Nothing but a dank drab picture, void of color."
3,Nobody told me I was going to cry...,"In all the reviews I've read of this book, not one mentioned the searing sorrow poor Elphaba endures. Maybe I'm oversensitive, but I found myself really depressed after reading this story. The first couple of sections are very witty and sometimes very funny, but the book takes a more serious tone around the middle that nonetheless does not prepare the reader for the extraordinary heartache to follow. I'm glad I read it, because it is a (fairly) well-written book with a very original and interesting take on a classic, but I wish someone had warned me that it certainly isn't a lighthearted frolic. It isn't Elphaba who's wicked; it's the world she's forced to live in."
2,Not a good bedtime story...,"I bought the book Wicked on CD and could not get very far with it. I tried listening to it at night at the same time as I would ordinarily read, before bedtime. At one point, there was a description given that just thoroughly turned me off having to do with the time clock and an incestuous sexual imagining/accusation used to incite people to violence against a family. This was not an image or idea I wanted in my mind while drifting off to sleep. I saw the play awhile back and enjoyed it,and I do not recall imagery as off-putting in it as what was in the book. I think stories are often made more palatable when put into a musical format. I do think that creating an alternate story for The Wizard of Oz was a fantastic idea, and the story that the author did create in Wicked is a good one. However, I would not recommend the audiobook since I wasn't able to get to what I know is good about the story."
2,It lacks a ball of fire,"After reading so many rave reviews, I found this book to be a tedious, clicheed and ponderously slow moving dissapointment. It's loaded with ponderous and clunky social commentary; even though I agreed with his opinions, I found the language and dialogue difficult to swallow. And while the Frank L. Baum books and the classic movie are enchanting, this book is a bore."
2,"Being a Wizard of Oz fan, I was intrigued...","But I have to say I had a hard time getting throught he entire book. Honestly if I hadn't purchased tickets to see the play I don't know that I would have made it to the end. After seeing the play I was glad that I took the time to read the book, it did give me the upper hand on others that had not read it."
3,This is NOT Oz,"This is not Oz, this is Nazi Germany. This is""Schindler's List"" with talking animals (or Animals),sorcery, and random elements of Baum's Oz sprinkled in. No wonder Dorothy wanted out of _this_ ""Oz."" Yes, the Witch is humanized, but only at the expense of turning the Wizard into Hitler..."
2,400 pages and a waste,"Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of fiction, but regardless, good fiction is engrossing with dynamic characters and a well-told story. With that said, Maguire has a strong command of language and is a great writer when you examine his technique. However, I DESPISED this story...I am familiar with the original Wizard of Oz story, and the potential of turning a classic on its head was alluring to me in addition to all of the attention that the musical is getting. In spite of my better judgment after the first 100 pages, I kept reading. I hated this book. It is one of the worst stories I have read in years. I am so mad that I paid for this. Even worse, I wish that I had not given it a chance and saved myself 400 pages of a warped, pretentious story that attempts to question the nature of good and evil. It fails miserably."
1,May I please give this no stars?,"I have reached an age where I no longer feel the need to read a book to the bitter end to ""give it a chance"". I did feel vaguely guilty that I decided to end the struggle after the first few chapters - but not enough to put myself through more torture. I am glad to see, that while I am in the minority, I am not alone. Boring! Don't waste your time or money."
1,Not a book for children,"Despite the apparent connection to the Wizard of Oz, this is definitely not a book for children! I was not expecting so much sex, explicit and implicit. Although some of that material is relevant for the plot, much is not. More importantly, because it was billed as a retelling of the Oz story from the perspective of the Witch, I did not pick up this particular book expecting to read about these issues. I did manage to read the entire book (with some effort) and was rewarded in places by some very funny dialog, but by the end of the book, I felt more pity than sympath for the Witch. I also felt that Dorothy and Toto were definitely NOT in Oz anymore."
1,Supposedly full of trash,"I bought this book for my wife, because she really wanted to read the story. Once it came and I gave it to her as a Christmas present, friends and other family members one after another told her or warned her that there was a lot of unnecessary filth in the book and to not waste her time reading it. Everyone said the exact same thing about it. She decided not to read it-wasn't worth it. Why waste time filling your mind with trash? So now it's in the middle of being sent back for a refund. Who knows what or how much garbage there really is, but better just ditching the whole thing. Author must have felt he had to compensate for something. I hear the play is great though!"
2,why all the hype?,"Wicked was one of our book club selections. It was fairly poorly recieved. Our group felt it was hard to sympathize with or relate to any of the characters. We also felt the authors writing style wasn't consistent throughout the book. For example, early in the book the conversations between characters are formal and somewhat stilted. Later on while characters are discussing the unfortunate death of Glinda the prose is rather ribald. We also felt that it seemed somewhat incongruous for negative and nasty Elphaba to 'carry the torch' for the Animals cause. We are not planning on reading the sequel. We could care less..."
1,Too Clever By Far,"I was greatly disappointed by this book.Gregory Maguire clearly wants to make us think, and has written a complex and deeply-thought out book. His mistake was placing it in the context of ""The Wizard of Oz"". More generally, placing it in the genre of fantasy.The fantasy genre is the dive bar of literature: The inhabitants are rough around the edges, unpretentious, and not the highest-functioning people. Gregory Maguire's book is not like that. His book stands out like a gentleman dressed for the opera mingling with a bunch of drunken truck drivers.I read fantasy because I want to enjoy it. I don't want someone to try to impress me with how well he writes or what deep points he's trying to make. Stephen King writes well and is unpretentious about it. Gregory Maguire merely writes well.I suspect that people who are enthusiastic about this book don't read much fantasy."
2,"Book = 5 stars...calling it a ""tie-in"" = no stars","If you've got a copy of ""Wicked"" with its other cover and can live without a few pages of pics from the Broadway show, don't get this version too. Maybe I've got a mixed-up idea of a ""tie-in,"" but to me it's not changing the cover to match the musical poster and adding in pictures. I assumed it was a rewrite so that the book and the musical stories matched more. Wrong. It's the same as the other cover.Don't get me wrong. I LOVE ""Wicked."" But I can't help but feel cheated. To call it a tie-in when it's the same book only with musical pictures, IMHO is false advertisement.Bottom line ~ BUY the book...but only one...not both."
1,Completely disgusting sexuality,"While the plot was mediocore and somewhat interesting, although slow, what disgusted me were the random, unneccisary sexual scenes. They were outlandishly weird and I wish I could get the imaginary images out of my head. I pressed through the first few scenes of them, thinking that they were just flukes, but I finally had to give up and throw the book away because I didn't want to leave any more of the perverse images in my head. I bought the book like most others, because I love the musical, but was sorely dissappointed. I'm going to make a point to tell people NOT to read it."
3,The Third Time's a Semi-Charm,"What can one say about a book that has gotten so much play? And why did it take me three tries to get through it? What was disappointing to me about this story was that it could have been so much better had it been simply a story about the Witch rather than a treatise on what constitutes ""wickedness"" and on the civil rights struggles of minorities. Why ruin a potentially amazingly entertaining story by making it so horribly political and borderline supercilious? It is not as deeply enlightening as the people who have read it make it out to be. I will say that Maguire is a literary genius. I would love to look into his expert bag of analogies and sneak a few for myself."
4,Excellent,"An excellent take on a traditional tale. However the pretend politics added too much verisimilitude to the novel. You sort of get lost in the wave of 'secret groups' against the 'nationalist government' or stuff like that. However, all in all, I loved the novel and loved Elphaba. A very profound look into the wicked witch role."
1,"The author, like Oz, is a fraud","If Maguire's intention was to perpetrate [...] on his readers -- lots of smoke and mirrors, big noise, big concepts, and gradually unmask himself as a pathetic, shallow person hiding behind his creations -- then he succeeded brilliantly. The characters are cardboard cutouts. The dialog is often an endless, tiresome, adolescent rant on, ""What does it all mean?"" It may be hip to be agnostic, but the author's agonizing inability to believe in ANYTHING makes it difficult to care about the events in his erratic narrative. I wanted to like this book. I did not."
1,Not good,"I was so looking forward to this book. For a variety of reasons I was sure that I would love it. Instead I found, after the first few chapters, that I was making myself read it in the hope that it was somehow going to get better. Its one thing to try and turn a light and frothy story into something deeper with political overtones, but its another to make it boring, awkwardly paced, and with dialogue that slips in and out of being stilted again and again. Some people loved it though, so I would think your best choice is to find a copy and read a bit to see what you think."
4,Grab your broom and take a ride.........,"A wonderfully delicious treat! This sharp witted and intelligent novel grabs the reader and pulls you, willingly, to the cheering squad for one of the most notorious literary villains, the Wicked Witch of the West. I'm delighted Mr. Maquire decided to 'pull back the curtain' and reveal such a entertaining adventure. The book does a great job of weaving storylines and characters from the original ""Wizard of Oz"" novel, that you almost feel the author holding your hand and guiding you effortlessly through the story. With his clever use of dialog, you are never quite sure which era you are visiting, which justs adds another magical layer to this yummy story. If you'ld like to find out what's up with those ruby slippers, what's so ""good"" about Glinda the Witch, and get the skinny on the Wicked Witch's water phobia, just open up ""Wicked"" and enjoy."
2,I wish I didn't read the ending,"This book was okay up until the ""sexual scene"" which I really can't remember much of because of how random and confusing it was. Eventually I got to a point in the book where I put it down and didn't finish it until a few months later when I decided I had to get it over with. Very disappointing ending. I wish I hadn't read the whole thing, so I could just think up a better ending. The book never got anywhere, and the whole book pretty much had no point. This idea really could've been so much more."
2,I wanted to love it - but it just WASN'T enjoyable!,"After reading all the great reviews about this book I was excited to read it. I love to read and have NEVER quit a book before I was finished. Let me tell you, with this one I was tempted.It just did not pull me in. I didn't feel the magic of the book at all. I did appreciate what the book was trying to do and at points I guess you could say it succeeded it but it was just SO slow. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen the entire time.I wouldn't reccomend this one. Sorry!"
3,too smart for me,"i think it was good. the book was well written, but it delt with all this political stuff that i just had no idea about. too young and ignorant i guess. but i did enjoy it and it put the story of the wizard of oz into a whole new and interesting perspective."
2,The only good thing that came out of this book was the musical.,"I'd heard the musical was really good, so I decided to read this before seeing it. I shouldn't have. It was 30 or 40 pages until Elphie was even born, and random small characters are suddenly given huge parts. The end of her time at the Emerld City was abrupt. Just watch the musical, but definately don't buy this book."
4,my first Gregory Maguire book,"But not my last. I love his writing. The characters are real and relatable, and you have to love it when the Wicked Witch of the West is the good guy. She's just misunderstood and Dorothy is a spoiled miserable brat."
3,Very Slow Read,"Ok. i had seen the play ""wicked"" and fell in love with the story. It was one of the best plays i've seen. So after seeing it, i ran out to get the book. Yes, i know its never quite the same. Well after finally getting through the book, i was very disappointed. Obviously, they had to change the story for stage, but I found that the book was just slow and very detailed. There were some funny parts and I did get through it (even though at times I wanted to throw the book across the room). There were parts I had to read over and over just to try to comprehend it (i'm not really dumb).Basically, i would skip the book and go see the play! The play brings all the familiar characters from the movie together in a way the book didn't."
1,Why???????,"I can't believe how highly this book has been rated. What a waste of perfectly good stars! I drudged through the book hoping at some point that it would become good or interesting or both. It didn't. It was poorly written and hard to follow. I was totally turned off and disgusted by the approach and content of the story. The idea of this book and his other books are very clever yet Mr. Maguire was not able to pull off anything that came close to clever. Needless to say, this was a very disappointing book."
2,Still trying...,I have started this book twice. The first time I got to about page 60 and gave up. The second time I got to the middle of the book and gave up again. I really could care less about any of the characters. Nothing in the book really makes me want to turn to the next page. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Left me hanging,"I don't know if the book suffered in my opinion for just having finished The Lord of the Rings series by Tolkien. This seemed immature or raw in some way, just left me asking is this it?"
2,Missed Opportunity,"After seeing the new Broadway musical version (loosely stated), I was excited to read Maguire's book...which came highly recommended by several friends. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The musical's script is a vast improvement over this aimless sprawl of a novel by bestowing the characters with MOTIVATION. In the novel, I found the characters poorly defined and the plot ill-focused. It's a shame, because Maguire's prose isn't without merit...he's just given us a real, real mess of a book. He starts so many threads without direction, and without wrapping them up. It is not a page-turner, and has no narrative sweep. If this is the ""prequil"" to The Wizard of Oz, it certainly wouldn't make anyone want to read Baum's classic.Anyone who wants to see a GOOD story inspired by Maguire's characters and a few of his ideas would do well to credit Winnie Holzman, who wrote the script to the new Broadway musical Wicked."
1,Boring!!,"I could not believe how boring this book was! It was nothing like I thought it would've been. The storyline is very dull, I didn't make much sense out of it, and I thought about throwing it in the dumpster! I am really glad I did not buy this book, luckily i borrowed it from a friend!You can't imagine how disappointed I was with this book! I thought it would be the coolest thing to find out about Thee Wicked Witch of the West! But it was boring, and I thought most of it didn't revolve around her anyway. The book could've been made so much better.... why wasn't it?"
5,Wicked witch? or Misunderstood woman?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A different look at a story known by us all. All that is considered good, is not necessarily true. As all that is considered bad, is not either."
3,its really dark and mean......but it does give more information,"if you are a big fan of the play, just a warning this book could ruin it for you. Its true the book was made first but its a little well..........dark. If you are someone who absolutly loves the show as much as i do, i would think twice before reading this book.But still its a great way to find out what happened Elphaba and Fiyero exited the stage together. It gives more information about the show. Its your call.........."
3,Fantasy Trip a Bit Boring,"I bought this book for my book discussion group. I ususally don't like fantasy, however the first 100 pages were very interesting. Unfortunately the author gets side tracked with subplots and minor characters. This prequel really has no relationship with Baum's Wizard of Oz other than the characters that the author could use, Baum being out of copyright.It is a somewhat interesting psychological study of how to produce evil, though whether the witch is evil is up for grabs.Oddly enough, a book that seems almost feminist in many ways, has female characters that are deeply flawed: Elphaba is physcially deformed, Melena is a promiscious druggie, and Galinda is an airhead."
4,Keep going!,This book started off really slow but picked up with a bang. I will never look at the wicked witch the same. Great reading..........
4,No One Mourns The Wicked,i was really interested in reading this book since i've always been a fan of the Wizard of Oz. i enjoyed reading this book immensly and would recommend it to anyone. the only problem i found was how political the book tended to be. and i was not interested in that at any sense. i also wish there had been more direct relation to the movie although that was just me personally. but i loved the book so much i went to see the play. which was phenominal. but nothing like the book
2,Interesting; lousy ending,"I like the Wizard of Oz, but after reading this book I realized that I liked it the way I remembered it, pure and unadulterated. I didn't need, or even want, the ""back story"" of the Wicked Witch. Her story is maybe just not worth telling.Though the story was sort of interesting, I thought the ending was inconclusive and didn't answer half of the questions I had. I finished the book feeling that it was still unresolved; certain issues were never ""wrapped up"" as well as I would have liked, in order for me to feel satisfied. Maybe I just didn't *get* it.UPDATE!! After getting to know the Broadway musical (which has a completely different ending) and then re-reading the book, I found I appreciated the book much more. On second reading, I feel like I GOT it."
1,a book that tries my patience,"I picked this book to read while waiting for my flight in ""January"" and I haven't finshed with it yet. I normally don't take much time to read one book. But this book just tries my patience. I'm still trying to finish it sheerly out of my tenacity and I'm almost there.I don't understand what the author is trying to say. Creating a good adult fairy tale? Well, I have had far better ones. Giving satirical version of current politics? Real-world affairs on TV are more informative. Basically I can't take away anything from this book.I first blamed my ignorace for failing to grasp the meaning, if any, of this book but reading other reviews here, I felt relieved that it wasn't just me. I will definitely not recommend this book to others. Just go and watch the play."
1,Does not live up to the reviews...,"I'm really trying to finish this book, but it just doesn't keep my attention. As a child, I detested the Wizard of Oz movie and books. I thought this might give me a different view of this particular fantasy world, but the book is just not compelling enough for me to concentrate on. I find myself mired in the author's writing style, wishing I could rewrite passages to make them flow more smoothly. As a wiccan I've read plenty of books that turn the notions of good and evil on their head, so that is nothing new.Disappointed...A"
2,"The movie was okay, but the book...","I never have completely favored the wizard of Oz. It was a pretty good movie. I think the book is okay, but worse than the movie. The crudity and detailed descriptions of sex make me want to throw up on the book and chunck it down a industrial strength diposal. Really why don't they just label the book as perverted, and title it 'how many ways can a witch do it'. This is not a book I would give to my friends!"
1,Dissapointed and a bit disgusted,"Okay, I bought the book because of the cover and the title, I know you're not supposed to do that, but come on, it looked interesting. WICKED could have been good, it has a great subject, but Maguire confuses the reader by introducing wild amounts of new characters and settings that it becomes alienating. Not the OZ we all know and love. He not only seemed determined to change Oz but destroy it forever. I would like to think that the word ... is not a part of the Oz vocabulary. With all the sexual tones it may seem the Maguire is trying to prove a point about Oz and it's citizens, he is not sucessful. Please, if you are looking for worthwile addition to the world of Oz, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Stymied,I am amazed at all the five star reviews this book has received. Did you people read the same book I read? A root canal with no anesthesia would have been more pleasurable.
1,Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,"This book departs dramatically from the original story. It doesn't even dovetail into the original story. The book is filled with degenerate scenes of little social value. It's not fresh, not creative, not noir but raunchy, a waste of time to read. Disappointing and definitely not recommended for under 17 crowd."
2,Was not what I expected,"I thought this book would be a great book, from what I heard of from the play. It was a good story, I just don't know how sex has anything to do with oz. I only got throught the first part. It was not easy reading and did not keep my attention."
1,The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,"I was very disappointed with the book. I felt that Gregory McGuire could have shown a little restraint in his descriptions of different scenes in the ""life of the wicked witch"" For instance, he could have just told us that her mother was adulturous instead of describing in detail(seriously) every sexcapade that she had!!! I felt this was more than any audience would want to know. I was looking for a charming story like the Wizard of Oz and instead I got treated to a description of body parts and sex. I would not recommend this book for anyone and I would hesitate to read any of his other books based on what I have read in this one. I was very excited to get this book and now I feel like all I can do with it is trash it because I won't allow anyone that I know to read it."
1,Bad Book,"I bought this book because of the musical and because it was about OZ before Dorothy arrived. It is a terrible book. Very hard to hold my attention. Chapters go on and on for no reason other than to have Mr McGuire show off his vocabulary and ability to stretch ideas on and on.One section is a long account of Elphaba and Fiyero's illicet love affair. He is,after all,married with three children.Elphaba (wicked witch of the west) has no morals. She is a completely unsympathetic central character. Most of the characters are unlikable. There are weird sexual encounters such as a naked man tied under a tiger in a compromising position for the entertainment of onlookers.One of the most disterbing Another aspects of the book is the mocking of religion. Another is that the Wizard of Oz is a really horribly person.If you enjoy perverted stories and unpleasant main characters and a complete perversion of OZ, then you might enjoy this book."
1,I did not like this book at all.,"By the time I got to page 40, I had a sick feeling in my stomach. I understand that the reason for the book was to explain how the wicked witch got that way, but reading all that sickening sexual and violent stuff was more than I could take. I did something I thought I would never do. I threw the book in the trash! No way would I recommend this kind of reading to anyone for any reason. Incest, adultery and perversion are not entertainment - they are sick and sad."
1,Not at all like the play,Hard to believe you could write a wonderful screenplay from this book. The play is awsaome and the book is so dark and twisted. Never got past the first chapter.
1,Very disappointing!,"I can't believe the reviews this book has gotten. I am an avid reader, and I have not been this disappointed with a book in a long time. I had the hardest time even finishing it! This book was way too slow, very drawn out, and I found myself constantly wondering what the author was smoking at the time he was writing it! This book was very strange, and definately not something I would recommend anyone buy, unless they are looking for a political, cockeyed view of the once charming Wizard of Oz story."
4,In brief...,"I struggled for quite awhile to figure out how to describe this book to my friends and explain why I loved it so without rambling on and on like I am starting to do now....It's like a near-perfect marriage of the styles of John Irving and Jonathan Swift: deep, quirky characterizations that continuously evolve through the course of the book, coupled with an intoxicatingly broad, witty and acerbic satirical bite. What more could one want? (So, why only four stars? I never quite shook the self-conscious mind-game of squeezing these three dimensional characters into the two-dimensional frames provided by their former L. Frank Baum and Hollywood versions. Perhaps this is a problem with pop-culture-Mike (me) and not Maguire's enchanting work at all...)"
5,Very entertaining,"I haven't read a lot of fiction, but this book has gotten me hooked into the world of Gregory Maguire. What a fun read! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes having fun..."
3,Elphaba! ~ Glinda the good witch who?,"Everyone has seen the movie the Wizard of Oz, well this book will change your perspective of the movie. I gave it three stars because, although it was a good book, I'm not quite sure that I am pleased with this new found out look I have. Now every time I watch the Wizard of Oz from this point on, I will be thinking ""Ahhh why doesn't everyone hate her? It's not her fault."" This book could also be something to open your eyes (in some strange way). Elphaba was made fun of for her whole life for being green, then he lover man dies, and things for this chick just never turn out well. I'm sure if I had her life I would be rude to everyone too. So after reading this book, you are just cruel if you still hate Elphaba! (If your ready to change perspectives, then read this book!)"
5,A book I will always cherish,"this book was very well written. It has changed a lot on my point of view for some things. Comical,romantic,dramatic, sad,philsophical, and a mystery to some. It has all the wonders and more to a great book. Kudos to Mr. Greogry Maguire. I recommend this book to anybody who wants to know the true meaning of evil."
1,SUCKED...such a disappointment!!,"I agree 100% w/Equipro. That review was spot-on, and took much more care than I would have to spell out the many ways this book sucked. I would've just said it sucked! I was so disappointed in these. I was very excited to read them. The concept was great - a reimagining of classic stories/characters - right up my alley! I expected to adore this series! I was so sure I'd like them that I read the first and second books and part of the third before I finally admitted to myself that I HATED them! I don't like his writing style at all, and I agree that his execution of this literary concept was sooooooo boring! I do not understand what all the hype is about w/these books. I strongly recommend skipping this writer for someone better. There's a lot of great stuff out there that deserves the attention more than this guy!"
4,A 'Wickedly' Good Read,"There was so much to this book. It would be redundant of me to comment on the specifics of this book - it was however very entertaining and enjoyable to read. The main character, The Wicked Witch of the West, was thought provoking in her thoughts, words and deeds.Plan on staying up late a few nights!"
3,Slogged through this book just to find out how it ended,"I tried really, REALLY hard to like this book. I loved the first section and devoured it quickly, but at the point Elphaba goes to university, I started to have a hard time and felt like I slogged through the rest of the book not because I was still enjoying it, but because I was so sold on the beginning and wanted to know the ending!Thank goodness I read this book on my Kindle, because I found myself highlighting every other word to look it up in the dictionary. This book probably increased my vocabulary, but it was a bit cumbersome to read."
3,Not the Greatest,"Don't get me wrong, Maguire's writing is great, and his word choices and structure is quite unique, but it's the story that lacks any real strength. Wicked starts off interestingly enough, but then moves very slow right thereafter, and then picks up near the end. I felt, however, that I was deprived of any real action or connection to the Wizard of Oz until towards the end - nothing of what I had expected.But perhaps my expectations were too high.I had expected a direct interweave to the storyline in the Wizard of Oz, and though there were some at the very end, there was not much to relate between the two, except for the world and some characters.Go ahead and enjoy if you're looking for an interesting story that takes place in the Land of Oz, but don't go assuming you're going to get a direct relation to L. Frank Baum's classic children's story."
1,"If you want the story from the play, this ain't it","We love the songs from ""Wicked"" (the play), so I bought this book, expecting a similar storyline. I flipped through the book before my 15 year old daughter read it, to check for content.What I found was sexual depravity (bedhopping and worse), borderline bestiality (what's with the tiger and naked people?), incestuous tendencies (sexual ecstacy giving rescue breathing to 'son' Liir?), pubic hair color, warm feeling in a child's crotch, and not much of a coherent storyline.If these things give you a 'charge', then go for it and read this thing.If not, then either do not buy it or have your tome join mine in the trash."
1,Wicked is really wicked,I was so excited to read this book but was sorely disappointed. This was not what I expected in a trip to OZ. The cussing is uncalled for and gross description of the sexual encounters was shocking. It was definetly more dark than I expected. I did not finish the book and plan on trying to sell it back. This was just not for me.
3,Disappointed.,"The book was interesting, in large part because I had put off reading it for so long. It was work to get through the story as it was disjointed and choppy but finally did make more sense once I read the second in the series."
2,Will not continue series,"I had mixed expectations for this book. I was intrigued by the story, but was told it was hard to read. It was definitly a hard read. I forced myself to continue reading through the first third of the book. The story of Elphaba's early years was disconnected and unclear. I enjoyed the story of her middle years and dealings in the Emerald City. The end once again becomes disjointed. It seems there is no clear direction. From the time Dorothy arrives in Oz, the book hits another gear and everything seems in a hurry to wrap up. The ending is abrupt and confusing. I will not continue the series."
5,The Real Oz,"As a fan of the world of Oz, Maguire's version is magnificent. The details of Oz and the humanity afforded the Witch are awe inspiring. It's so cleanly written, the descriptions leap brilliantly to life in your mind and the hours sweep past unnoticed while reading this book. Maguire is a genius storyteller, taking classic fairytales and giving them real meat and bones. Any adult who loved the original fairytales should read Maguire's versions, you won't be disappointed."
3,More like 3.5 stars,"If I could give half-stars, this book would get three and a half. I thought it was an great concept and I was interested enough to keep reading until the end but I did find some parts fuzzy and confusing to me. I'd like to read the original Oz books now and see how they correlate to this book."
4,The item was as I expected!,I got fast service at a great price! The book arrived in great condition!
2,Details!,"If you want to know every detail about the witch, it's great. Half way through and it all is background info. Warped, interesting and kinky."
2,Lost Interest,I lost interest in this book and struggled to finish it. I lovedthemusical but was not impressed with the book.
2,Not too impressed,"I would actually give this 2.5 stars if that were an option. I'm not sure why this series of books became so popular. One one level, the idea of reconstructing the world of Oz is interesting. Beyond that, I didn't feel this novel created a meaningful or cohesive narrative. The protagonist's character seemed to be inconsistent, two-dimensional much of the time, and unsympathetic through most of the story. Relationships with other characters rarely developed in a meaningful way, and those that seemed promising lost cohesion after awhile. It was very difficult to get a grasp of the motivations or inner workings of the protagonist's mind throughout much of the book. She actually seemed very uninterested in herself, which made it hard to invest in her. I found by the end that I still didn't care about the characters or the story itself. Disappointing, given the hype!"
4,Such a different point of view!,"A friend of mine gave me this book when she saw that i was collecting fairy tales and such. I am so glad she did!This was a great spin on a classic story. Seeing the world through Elphaba, the little green girl's eyes made me feel much differently about one of my favorite tales! In following Elphaba's struggles to grow up and live a semi-normal life, it isn't hard to imagine why she became the Wicked Witch of the West.I highly recommend this to anyone looking for different twists on classic tales. Maguire writes this tale beautifully and it definitely designed to make you think twice about the Wicked Witch!"
2,"I felt like I was studying a textbook, not enjoying a read","I know I am in the distinct minority, but this book just didn't do it for me. My typical literary fare is not light stuff, so I don't think I was being too ambitious to undertake this book. However, it turned out to be a laborious and heavy handed read. I have nothing against metaphor and allegory, and I enjoy works that cause me to think. But this one just wasn't the enjoyable read I had expected based on its popularity and hype."
2,A Tornado of Confusion,"While the book definitely had a few highlights, there were too many unanswered questions and loose ends that were never tied up. Though Maguire has many creative ideas, they get lost in a sea of unnecessary events (e.g. Boq's extremely long attempt at wooing Galinda/Glinda) and superficial explanations for events in the classic version of the Witch's tale (e.g. how the flying monkeys came to be). Overall, there are too many plotlines/details that never tie together in a cohesive way, making Wicked a mediocre read, at best."
1,Not So Hot,"As someone who read all of the original Oz books as a kid, I thought this new side of the story would be good. I was wrong. Maguire did not do his research into the land of Oz. He repeatedly confuses locations and facts about characters and environments. The blatent mistreatment of L. Frank Baum's creations is not my only fault with this book. The writing is somewhat shallow, and slightly unfocused. Also, he doesn't seem to be focused so much on his characters as his message, making the characters seem slightly two-dimensional. One thing this book has going for it...it wasn't nearly as bad as it's sequel."
1,detached,"Hey, it doesn't take a lot to move me emotionally. I mean, I cry frequently when I read the newspaper in the morning. But this book didn't get me in any way. I didn't feel much of anything for any character--good or bad. There is no in-depth characterization. Seems like everybody is pretty much on the bad side, though Elphaba is supposedly standing up for the animals (a pretty weak stance). I just can't muster any emotion for anybody and that's a pretty bad thing to say for a novel. I think the concept--a prequel to a story everybody already knows--was probably enough to sell the idea. A decent writer in terms of verbiage, but please give me a character I can feel something for."
2,I struggled to keep reading it,"I recieved this book as a gift, along with tickets to see Wicked. I was so excited to start reading the book, until I actually started to read it. There was just way too many charecters to keep track of. When one of them died, I had to page back in the book to jog my memory on who in the heck it was. It took me 4 months to get through the book. I just found it rambling on & on. So needless to say, I was not excited to see the show after reading the book, but I was surprised. The show was great, the book sucked. If you are going to write a spinoff from one of the most loved movies of all time, thing should really be a little more accurate. I watched the Wizard of Oz again, and the book is inconsistant with the movie. It's a shame because I think this book had tons of potential but fell really flat."
2,They made a broadway musical out of this??,"I am halfway through this book, and was told its a little slow, yet so far it has not grasped me the way other similar fantasy books have. More to the point, how did they make a Broadway Musical out of this book? I guess I just don't get it!!"
2,"Great premise, terrible execution.","The only reason I even gave this book 1 star, let alone 2, is that it was the basis for the very charming and enjoyable Broadway play. Otherwise the book is just terrible. Maguire has created a wonderful plot line but he bogs it down with so much political detail that it just makes for a boring book to read. I managed to get through the first section and then gave up because I just didn't care anymore."
3,a good read,"This book by Gregory Maguire is an interesting book. It certainly gives a different look at the Wicked Witch of the West as found in the Wizard of Oz. It is amazing how one can take the witch found in the Oz book and make such an interesting background story about it. I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,"Its not the movie, and thats good.","If you can start this book with an open mind and not insist it must play out exactly like the movie, you'll enjoy it. I love the idea of taking a well known story such as the Wizard of Oz and writing the biography of one of the key characters, which we somehow know very little about. Its fun to imagine the Wicked Witch an a child and young adult. Reading this book is like getting the rest of the story."
2,Hoping Against Hope,"And that's the summation of this book. I should start off by saying that truthfully I did really want to like this book. I'm not dogging on it just for the sake of ruffling a few feathers. It has an incredible concept and the plot is so inspired, as are the characters.However (and this is a big however) I find Maguire's writing completely lackluster. It's not sparse in some styleistic way, nor blunt in any sort of impacting way. It's just blah. And the times that he does try to put a little more 'oomph' into the writing at emotional and pivotal moments, it is just so clunky and stiff.As a result I really didn't care that much about the characers, and as inspired the plot points, I wasn't on the edge of my seat trying to find out what was next.I understand that there were some important themes to get across, I mean alienation, the question of predestination and all that which Maguire deals with in a pretty deft manner.But the writing!"
3,not for kids,"I purchased this book after seeing Wicked on Broadway. I'm planning on bringing the kids to see it this summer, so I thought I'd read the story to them first. Don't read it to the kids, there are many sexual parts in the book. Fop an adult its great."
3,Good book for adults - NOT FOR CHILDREN!,"My ten year old & friends have all been ""into"" Wicked. We're going to see it next week. So I bought him the book a few months ago, he read it and enjoyed it. I started reading it last week so I would understand the musical better. HORRORS! Within the first 5 pages was a bizarre detailed sexual incident. The ""F"" word is sprinkled throughout. I'm only halfway through and there was yet another graphic sexual encounter with some of the mythical type creatures and people. As I said, the story has been good so far...but I was mortified that I let my child read it. Who would've thought that a story based from a rated G movie would be so vulgar? There should be a kid's version."
4,loved it.,"i loved the book. a bit of an abrupt ending, however, it does follow through with the original ending of the wicked witch of the west. despite that, the author really has transformed her into a great leading lady and you fall in love with her anyway.i would recommend it."
5,The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,One of the best books I have read. I am nearly finished and I am truly hooked!!I read while riding home from work and can't wait till I pick it up the next day. Looking forward to reading Son of a Witch next.
1,Lost between a great idea and smut,"I bought this book with high hopes. I really wanted to enjoy it. At first I did! The birth narrative was humorous and exciting. Shortly after, however, the book fell apart. My main problem with this book is that is was not well written. The characters were shallow and unlikable. The plot was rushed and barely comprehensible at times. I was expecting a book which explored the depths of the characters of Glinda, Elphaba, etc. What I got instead was a writer who couldn't decide if he wanted to write a trashy romance novel or a semi-interesting action book. What he eventually turned out is a book which only teases to get better, but only gets worse with each sentence.I got it because I wanted to love it. Now, I would never recommend it to anyone unless you are really interested in an ankle deep approach to the land of Oz."
1,Not a page turner,"I really had some great expectations with this book. What a great concept. What a mess. This book is a trainwreck. A mangled mess of characteration, plot (if one can be found) and storytelling. Where's the fantasy? Where's the magic?How can the Wicked Witch of the West be turned into the most boring villian in literary history? All the secondary characters are forgetable, only because they are never developed. That's the one thing I can say about the author, he's consistent. There are a lot of plot-holes, and unanswered questions. This book just doesn't have the ability to make you care, or to feel anything but relief that the last page has arrived... finally."
2,Brilliant concept fails in execution,"The idea of telling the story from the witch's point of view is genius. The first half of the novel kept my interest and made me even more curious about how the second half of the novel could possibly create a sensible explanation of the events in The Wizard of Oz. Instead, the second half gets muddled down in a listless plot that fails to provide a satisfactory relationship to either the 1939 movie or Baum's original novel.I'm glad that I read a synopsis of the musical after reading the novel. I think the plot from the musical is a far more interesting answer to the question of who the Wicked Witch of the West was."
5,Wicked: The life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.,"I have read Wicked and Son of a witch, I just cannot say enough about this authors books. They are very well written and they really keep you interested. I am a very picky reader and he is author that I learned to love."
4,a revisionist novelist,"Wicked is a well crafted weaving of the fictional history I struggled to remember from childhood and vibrant new characters worthy of their invention. The language of the book is elevated, whimsical and passionate. The characters are multi-dimensional and surprising. The settings are intricate enough to warrant it's own game of Risk and the themes are varied and vital.With all that said, the marvel I took away from this book was MacGuire's ability to twist our perspective so greatly as to swap the Witch's role from antagonist to protagonist. In 380 plus pages, he's deprogrammed twenty plus years of programming in my mind concerning who is at fault for the events from the original book."
3,"Clever, but....","Although i did enjoy this novel because of its different spin on a classic, i was disappointed. Maybe i wished at least one of the characters from the book would actually turn out to be good, or if i just love the fairy tale too much, is hard to say. I also wish that Maguire would have either matched the book completely to the movie, or completely to the book, not take elements from both. He mostly matched the book to the movie, but then would add extra points that only those who read th book would recognize. I have also been told that this book was funny, but didnot find it so at all."
4,"good, but not great","I really, really, really, wanted to read this book for some time. The premise is fascinating and the possibility is tantalizing. I finished and enjoyed the book, but it wasn't what I had anticipated. Elphaba definitely got a bum rap as the wicked witch. I enjoyed her college days and felt like just when things would be getting good, the story coursed off in another direction and I was kind of left wanting more. I love the fact that she had a lover and a child and there was so much more that could have been developed, but alas, it wasn't.The political manipulation of it all (Oz, the wizard, the witches, etc) could very well be from the pages of US today....I recommend it, but it still didn't meet my expectations."
4,Interesting book....NOTHING like the musical,"This book was interesting. It was a little hard to get into but once it got going it was a good read. If you are reading this book because you loved the musical, which is me...STOP NOW!!! The book is nothing at all like the musical. I couldn't even adventure a guess as to where they got the content from this book for it. The book is good, and a very interesting read, but not a read if you are looking for an addition to the musical."
2,"Very disappointing read, after hearing all of the hype.","After hearing loads of excitement surrounding this novel, and the much acclaimed Broadway musical that followed, I was anything but impressed with this read. I kept waiting for something, anything to happen. The climax never truly comes when reading the book, and it's a very flat tone through to the end. I would not personally recommend this book to anyone."
2,not so great,"I'm still reading the book, I'm half way through and I'm surprised it's so bad...Actually I have to say it's boring. Very boring...YAWN!....I can't get myself to pick it up and continue. I really had high hopes for it but the right now I'm in the college years and I'm yet to get to the peak or close to the peak of the story.I think this book is riding on the success of THE WIZARD OF OZ story otherwise the storytelling is very poor."
4,"Interesting look at the other ""rest of the story""","I stumbled on this book as I ususally do... hunting through every bookstore that I come in contact with when I'm home in the US for a visit. Actually, I think I found this is book at an airport bookshop. I read it over the course of just two days because I couldn't put it down! I remember the first day that I started the book just after breakfast and I didn't look up until I realized it was getting difficult to see because it was getting dark outside! Now, THAT'S what a novel is supposed to do to you!I think that Maguire is an imaginative genius. Thanks Gregory! I loved it!"
4,Good Stuff,"This is the first of Gregory's books that I've read, I've got two on the shelf waiting for me. I like a story to be interesting and entertaining. I'm always ready to suspend reality to enjoy a story. Revisiting a familiar story from another angle is very entertaining and I can't wait to read the rest of Gregory's book."
4,You'll never see the Wizard of Oz movie the same way again!,"I'd heard about the musical - and was intrigued by the concept. In the end, like when they convert books to movies - there's no way a musical could capture the full story or world that Maguire draws us into. He's so closely aligned a parallel world of what was actually going on during the Wizard of the Oz movie (including where those silly flying monkeys came from) that you'll never be able to watch the movie the same way again.As others have said, his writing style is a little long-winded. But, the story is worth wading through those longer parts. It's imaginative and clever --- and reminds the reader that truth - not just beauty - is in the eye of the beholder."
5,"Oh, what utter delights","Positively delicious! How could I possibly have forseen falling for the ""Wicked Witch of the West""? Brilliant. Exotic. Her most noble intentions thwarted by fate throughout her life. The elusive whispers of larger schemes, eloquently (subtly, and only partially) revealed. Do yourself a justice and read Wicked.I'm off to read The Wizard of Oz... which I now understand is clearly a tale told from the perspective of the antagonist.(...and her little dog too...)"
3,Sometime good people do bad things.,One thing this book does do is make you look at the witch differently. It becomes clear that there are reasons she's doing everything she does. She doesn't do it just for evil.This book was entertaining but a little long on the social commentary. I found I was getting bored but it got better towards the end. I'm glad I stuck with it.One word of warning though - this takes place in the Baum Oz not the movie Oz. You will still understand what's going on but there are scenes the movie adds that aren't in the book that are skipped over ( like the fact that the witch in the books doesn't appear as soon as Dorothy get to Oz. ) This is only slightly confusing but very easy to figure out. Essentially - don't worry about it - you'll be able to figure out what's going on anyway.Very interesting though the relationship between the Witch and Glinda ( yes there is one. )And we finally learn the witch's first name! But you'll have to read it to find out.....
2,Just wasn't my cup of tea.,One of the people in our book club wanted to read this. I found the book hard to read and spread thin on story.
2,"Great idea but took it too, too far!","The idea for the book was great, but the book was way too long, although the ending wasn't quite long enough. You shouldn't read this book until your 16 or 17, at least. It was way too confusing for me. Some parts of the book were more intersting than the others, and it was interesting to see into her life, but definately not a book to put on a young adults list."
2,Why trash up what could be a great story?,"My only real complaint about this book is the trashiness. Why do authors, screenwriters, etc., find it necessary to trash up what otherwise could be great stories? Now that it's been read, I will delete it from my Kindle library so my young readers won't accidentally start reading it."
2,Too much story for a quick ending.,Probably not going to make any friends with this review... I didn't care for this book. I really tried to get into it but it was really all over the place. There are several inconsistencies in this book that bother me for example Elphaba (Wicked Witch) is in support of Animals (with a capital A) but towards the end of the book she is experimenting putting wings on monkeys! I felt the author threw this in and also tied up ALOT of loose ends with the last chapter of the book. The book was a slow read and waiting for something to happen took forever. The ending was rushed and thrown together and I was left very disappointed.
1,"boring, boring, boring","Don't know how they got the nerve to make a play out of this awful book, I found it so boring I couldn't finish. It has nothing to do with L. Frank and Oz. None of his creativity and cleverness. I'm glad I didn't buy the book."
3,Not too shabby,"I have to admit that when I started this book, I wasn't expecting a darker side to the land of Oz. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Maguire's depiction of this wonderful world, from the different views on religion to the concept of Animals wishing to obtain equal rights. The character of Elphaba was very amusing to me as I watched her mature into a woman who could only question what was to come and what could have been. But once I reached The Muder and its Afterlife, I was disappointed to find that Maguire basically ruined The Wizard of Oz by telling it from a completely different perspective. The Wizard was a rapist, The Wicked Witch of the West wasn't all that wicked, and Elphaba's accidental death was altered drastically. I gave this book three stars because, while I enjoyed the first four parts, the end of the book burdened me with a completely different view of the The Wizard of Oz."
4,Wicked book!,"This book was great! The climax was at the end though and it felt like the story was going a little slow until the middle. After the middle of the book, it just keeps better and better! I have a hard time finishing books because I lose interest easily, but not for Wicked!"
3,Interesting twist on a classic,"My only problem with this book is that it turns a happy tale into something ugly. It has a great twist at the end, and the writing style is great. Just note that it is very DARK."
5,The Real Wicked Witch of the West,"I love this book. Gregory McGuire has, in Wicked, managed to make the Wicked Witch of the West more frightening than she ever was on my television screen. Far from the evil torturer seen in the classic film, she becomes the tortured, living with crushed ideals of adolescence, in the shadows of crimes she committed and mistakes she made. McGuire makes the Wicked Witch of the West human, scary and frightening and complicated as us all."
1,Much Ado about nothing,"I cannot believe this book was so popular. It was slow, boring, and ridiculously arrogant. The author took a wonderful premise and completely dissected it until there was nothing left but a few interesting crumbs which were quickly swept away. This could have been a beautiful dark story but Maguire weighed it down with misguided political and philosophical banter and turned a fabled icon into a sex starved coed working for the Oz equivalent of PETA. Don't pay for this book. If you're curious, rent it from your local library and save yourself 15 dollars."
4,Not the musical.,"If all you know of Wicked is the Broadway musical, you need to know that the book is very different. All the main characters in the musical were in the book. That's a given. But without spoiling anything for you, the endings of the two are very different. Don't buy this looking for a novelization of the musical. You won't find it.That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed both this book and the musical. One almost has to look at the two as separate entities because of the differences. The tone of this book is much more serious and dark compared to the musical. There are a lot of political overtones and things you just can't find on Broadway. Elphaba's dilemmas are much more complex than love or disillusionment.This is not the light and fluffy story of Broadway and it's not the sweet technicolor Land of Oz. Leave those expectations at the first page, and you might just enjoy this book."
1,Very disapointing,I was very intrigued by this book and then very disapointed. I think it was a great idea to explore the life and times of the wicked witch. It was a great idea but I found the characters fell flat. It was a disapointing and painful read.
1,How soon we forget,"Macquire exercises writers' license in assuming an interpretation totally out of character with L. Frank Baum's original writing. Most others refer to the film of the Wizard of Oz when making a link; few have read the unabridged original writing when making their comparison. Baum's purpose was to write children's fantasy without the nightmarish potions that Macguire stirs up. As another reader said, ""This isn't even fit for adults."" Enough said."
1,"Musical to Book, Book to Musical","I was very disappointed with this book for the following reasons. First, I must admit I saw the musical before reading the book and therefore I kept expecting events which took place in the musical to occur in the book, they did not. Second, the author I felt did not develop the relationships between characters and therefore I did not care about what happened to them. Third, after seeing the musical I expected a fun light read, this book is not, it is very dark and graphic. Fourth, the musical is appropriate for middle school children and older, the book on the other hand I don't feel is appropriate do to the sex, affairs and other events narrated in graphic detail."
1,don't bother,"Nice idea, horrible read. This is a disjointed story at best. None of the family and friends who have read the book this summer liked it. We all thought the story was too fragmented, bits and pieces, but either poorly or not connected together at all."
3,"Good story, but took too long to tell it","I personally do not like books dripping with descriptions. I like to read something with alot of action that keeps your interest. This book has too much description for my liking. The story itself is good, but is slowed down too much by the extraneous details.For anyone who has seen the broadway play, the book and the play are very far apart. I saw the play first, and I think that is part of the reason I was disappointed in the book."
3,Great idea for a story but left me short...,I thought the premise was very interesting and Maguire does make it plausible. I just wasn't captivated like I was expecting to be after reading such glowing reviews.
3,um,"I was one of those more mislead musical fans. I liked the musical's story and thought it was not blasmephying Oz. However, when I read the 1st part i thought it was weird how he could put 58 pages or so in Elphaba's birth and the rest-the importance of the parts, in such a little space. the 2nd part was ok, but again Maguire envelops himself in a love affair between Boq and 'Elphie'. Galinda(Glinda) is like a simpleton. She doesn't have the least charm that is so good in the musical. And Fiyero? Weirdo. Nothing like the musical."
1,Wickedly Boring,"I was disappointed in this book! It reminded me of the semester at Indiana University in which we spent the entire class discussing James Joyce's ULYSSES--and nothing else!This book seems forced and overly thematic. The struggle between good and evil is inflated, and I finished the book with heavy lids. Not recommended!"
1,Less than mediocre.,"I once heard a teenage box office salesman describe Chekov's Three Sisters as ""three hours about not going to Moscow."" That's pretty much how I feel about this crap novel. Maguire creates setup after setup that have no payoff. The characters are static and thin, the weak drama makes daytime TV seem edgy...I just can't overstate my distaste for this novel. Maguire seems to have tried something that's way beyond his reach. I can't believe he's built a career exploiting L. Frank Baum's fictional universe. Carpet baggery."
1,Awful,"The book is completely different than the musical - loved the musical, hated the book. The book was very racy and hard to get through."
1,I am an avid reader and I HATED this book!!!,This book is a HUGE waste of time. I do not understand what the POSITIVE hype is all about.
3,Good but too many characters,There were parts of the book that were very engaging. Elphaba is a complex character. The problem is that there are too many characters and it was difficult to follow all of the subplots. The author is very good at creating an alternate reality that you could believe in. I was very impressed with that.
4,"ADULT CONTENT - Not for kids - sex, discrimination, assasination, terrorism etc","I purchased this book because my 12 yr old daughter is currently a huge fan of Wicked (the musical) and thought it would be a nice gift. I was shocked when it arrived and I glanced through the first chapters. I then kept the book (which is great, for ADULTS) and bought something else for her."
2,Not my cup of tea,I loved the Wizard of Oz. I saw the musical Wicked on Broadway and loved it. But I can't say the same for the book. This is one that I really struggled with to finish. It's a dark story that has no relation to the plot of the musical. It's hard to follow and at points down right confusing. Maybe it just not my cup of tea. This is not a book that I could recommend.
2,Disappointing.,"I heard so much about this book, thought it would be great. So this was quite disappointing. The original series of OZ stories are so much better. They are not always happy either. This book borrows a lot from them, but with less originality. Decidedly not a children's book, parts are offensive. The concept is good, but execution not so hot."
1,Liberal Agenda?,"The story of Alphaba, Wicked Witch of the West, was quite interesting. However the liberal agenda used in Maguires' writing was overpowering. Where else can one find political corruption, equal rights for all, animal rights, sexuality than in the liberal arena. What is Maguire trying to promote in the book; the story of the Wicked Witch or his ideals?"
1,True story of the wicked witch?,"The concept certainly had potential. But this author simply couldn't pull it off. There is no plot. The story rambles and digresses. Characters and places with unpronounceable names come and go. The author's attempts at sexual content come off as simply lurid. There are no characters to whom one is drawn, especially not the protagonist, Elphaba, who is self-absorbed and hateful. I ""read"" the unabridged CD version. I picked up the book to give me background before going to see the musical, Wicked. I wish I hadn't. The book is dark and depressing where the musical is light and fun."
3,Excellent characterization!,"While certainly an interesting and clever take on the classic Wizard of Oz story, I struggled a bit through this book because the style of writing wasn't very smooth flowing and easily understood. Also, I was a bit put off by the overt sexual content, which made it not for the same target audience as the original children's tale. Still, it was a worthwhile read and provided a fascinating glimpse into how the Wicked Witch of the West might have evolved into the character she presented in the original story. Although I live just 35 miles from Manhattan, I have yet to see the Broadway musical Wicked, and after reading this story, I feel strongly inspired to do just that!"
4,Political & Intriguing.,"If you're picking this book up expecting the story presented in the Broadway musical, you will be disappointed in that there is hardly an uplifting message. If you do not enjoy a novel with politic you will not enjoy this one, but that doesn't make it a horrible read. Keeping in mind the general assumption that politic requires time to read, be prepared to spend some time contemplating the details of this novel - if it pulls you in. Also presenting disturbing questions about good and evil, this novel reaches into the morality of its readers - something I thoroughly enjoyed."
1,So what!,"This book was recommended by a close friend and I was intrigued by the concept. I couldn't get past page 31. It was so forced and so ""clever"" I couldn't stand it and stopped reading. Thank heaven I had only borrowed the book. I'm sure it will please amd amuse some. I'm not 'some'."
1,This book was a total waste of time... a lot of time,"What a long drawn out unbelievably boring book. I was so ready for an intellegent analytical look at what could possibly make a person become a witch, and instead I got this unanalyzed jumble of characters book which left me with no further understanding and time that I can't get back. This book was really bad.... there was not a single character that I liked, looked up to or even understood. This is saying a lot because there were so many characters it was hard to keep up with all of them and remember their relation to one another, but as the book moved from character to character there was not a single time when I wished he would go back and write more about any one of them. There are so much better books out there, don't even waste your time with this one!"
4,A Very Enjoyable Book!!,"This was a very in-depth look at the life of the Wicked Witch (Elphaba) that really proves her to be not as wicked as we have been led to believe. You'll love the story behind the shoes!! And you'll peek into the love-life of the witch also. I am starting to read Mr Maguires latest book Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister right away. I highly recommend Wicked, you won't be disappointed."
5,Wickedly Wonderful,"Don't get stuck on the story from the movie. Get the real story of the Wicked Witch of the West in this book. You'll cry and laugh along with the green heroine of the book. Made me see the whole story in a new light. So enjoyable. If you even slightly love fantasy, this book is for you!"
2,"Great Idea, Dull Book","If only a really special and interesting author had had the idea that Gregory Maguire had, to write a novel about the early years of the Wicked Witch of the West. Alas, the idea was had by Gregory Maguire, who seems to have a lot of really good ideas but no real idea of what to do with them.There are a lot of interesting ideas in Wicked, from recasting the Wizard of Oz as a Hitlerian Machiavellian political schemer and tyrant to having Glinda and the Wicked Witch be childhood pals. Unfortunately, the ideas remain ideas, and Maguire never makes the book take off into anything special or memorable.If Angela Carter had written this, it would have been an unforgettable adventure into fantasy, terrible and beautiful. Gregory Maguire takes a dazzling idea and makes it dull as dishwater. Quite simply, an ordinary novel about extraordinary events and characters."
4,"Book first, Musical second.","Though this book doesn't necessarily answer any big questions left by the creators of The Wizard of Oz, the genius of this book is that it traces the roots of the characters so that you can see how Elphaba eventually becomes the wicked witch.When one reads or watches the Wizard of Oz, one just comes to understand that there is a wicked witch, becuase every great story has a ""bad guy"". However, one would not expect for the witch to have been born good, but have chosen to become evil(star wars anyone?), the viewer likes to believe that those who are evil were conceived with evil DNA, and raised in an evil environment where she was allowed to put her elbows on the table.i enjoyed the book because i chose to read it in preparation for the musical that came out with this storyline. the musical has great music, and if it follows the plot of the book well, it should be a great broadway hit."
5,The best book I have ever read,"This book was wonderful. I thought it really tied in and told of the past from munhkinland, give more info. than just knowing a house fell from the sky and landed there. It was really emotional, and I think if anyone who reads it didn't absolutly love it, they just skimmed, rather than actually read it, and soaked up what was happening. This was a great book"
2,Well...,"I'm seeing a lot of high-and-mighty reviews here. The truth is, this book isn't only readable by ""intellectuals."" The writing is fairly good, though his other books are better. The main problem with this book, though, is the unnecessary sex. I don't want to quibble with the amount - is it too vulgar? - but nevertheless, graphic sex in a book is supposed to serve a purpose, and in this book it doesn't. It doesn't help the story along at all, though the plot idea is pretty interesting.The musical, on the other hand, is amazing! Though it hardly follows the book, the plot is more creative, and the story is beautiful."
1,"Don,t bother",Wicked was the worst book I have ever stopped reading. It is very poorly written. The author contiually uses unnecesary $10 words I guess to try to fill the page. Way overdone. It is no wonder they had to remake the play otherwise no one would ever go see it. I really hate that I PAID for this book. Yuck!
1,I kept waiting for it to get better...,"I was relieved to read the other reviews here who felt the same way I did about this book. I ended up struggling through the first half which took weeks (normally I read a GOOD book of this length in a few days at most). I kept expecting it to get better - it didn't. I don't remember the last time I didn't finish a book. I do know a couple of people who loved it. If you decide to read it, borrow it - and good luck."
3,"Interesting concept, but got bogged down. . .","The concept is fascinating--tell the story from the Witch's point of view--but Maguire got so bogged down in long, boring discussions of philosophy, religion, and politics that the plot really suffered. I found it hard plodding to finish the book--it just didn't captivate me like I expected it would. Also, I felt that with the jumping forward in time between sections, several threads were never satisfactorily resolved.Nevertheless, it's very well-written for what it is, and Elphaba turns out to be a fascinating, many-faceted character. I just wish there was more action and less philosophy."
2,Wicked: Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,"This was truly a weird book. None of the characters were endearing and I did not like the bestiality or heavy politics. I kept reading it, hoping it would get better, but it never did."
3,Not what I expected but...,"I downloaded this to my Kindle.This read was not what I had expected, nor did I think it lived up to the title. It was hit and miss and would take you off into another direction then slap you back into the mainstream. I found this a bit confusing at first but became boringly used to it as I continued. I can say honestly that I found this book slightly painful to read but not so that I could put it down and forget where I laid it.But it did come close."
1,Lost Hope,"The premise of this book is a great idea. I've seen the musical version three times and absolutely love it and so, I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, those hopes were dashed. As with other reviewers, about half way through I began to question the intent. I kept the hope alive however, because, having seen the musical, I had an idea of where this story could go. All I can say is that I was sorely disappointed. I recommend reading several reviews before purchasing this item as others will have differing opinions."
2,Long With No Development!,"Honestly, I was disappointed, but not in the way I expected. I thought the book would be silly, but instead of silly it was...boring. Maguire seems to have a lot of different axes he wants to grind, with the end result being that nothing really gets the notice it deserves. It's like he wanted to have everything, and he did: but nothing got really looked into.The extended review of this blog is available at [...]."
4,Very enjoyable,I am pleasantly surprised at the story line. Some reviewers cautioned that it dragged a bit but so far I haven't found that to be the case. I can't believe I actually feel sympathy of the Wicked Witch of the West! Who would have thought it. I would recommend this book.
3,Not what I thought it'd be,"This book started out as a mix of mystery & drama. The first section about the birth and childhood of Elphaba was interesting and kept me guessing how she would turn out as the WW of the West that was in the movie (I haven't read the original books). Then the story took some illogical turns and seemed sometimes like it was written one page at a time with no thought of the rest of the story. I kept waiting for Elphaba to finally become the ruler of an oppressed land, but she was just too likable and almost bumbling. The characters are well developed and fun but just didn't mesh into the story I thought it would be.My husband bought me this book and ""Mirror, Mirror"" for Christmas. I returned ""Mirror, Mirror"" and bought a parenting book, which I am enjoying and finding helpful."
2,Boring,"This book was highly recommended to me and I see that most of the other reviews are very good but I don't get it. I found the book incredibly uninteresting and dull to read. My sister read it at the same time and had the same opinion.I was expecting the book to have a lot of clever tie-ins and twists relating back to the L. Frank Baum novels. Instead, I found a story that barely had anything to do with the original works, either in tone or substance. The new story just didn't interest me at all. Maybe I missed something but I could barely get through the book so couldn't recommend it to others."
1,Nothing close to a fun read,"This is the kind of thing you need a degree in literture to appreciate. The characters just sort of wander from here to there purposelessly to no real impact on the world around them. Sex is rampant, but brings little happiness. Family ties are burdensome and intrusive. There is no fidelity. Religion is constantly referenced, but resolves nothing. Mysterious dwarfs and hags lurk in the fringes, affecting people in subtle ways. Are they working towards evil or good? It doesn't seem to really matter either way. Opression, environmental destruction, fascism, nihlism and terrorism topped off with heaping dollops of enui. I kept reading waiting for something to make me care or feel for the title charector, or any charactor for that matter, but in the end, I felt like I wasted $20 at the airport."
1,So Depressing. Do yourself a favor and see the Musical!,"I loved the musical ""Wicked"" so I bought the book. The book is a total downer and just keeps dragging on. I just didn't see the depth appreciated by other readers."
5,My Son Loves This Book,This 5 star rating is from my son. He loves this book and borrowed it from a friend to read. He was excited when I surprised him with his very own. I've not read it but he and his friends have and they are big fans of it.
1,takes the fun out of OZ,"This book is a real downer. It is way too adult for teens. It's more about government and religion than the witch. The only reason I finished it was because I had it on CD and I was driving a long distance. I kept waiting for it to resemble the movie in some way. The only way it did was the characters names.This book isn't funny or fun and really isn't even fantasy. It's more of a soap.I've yet to read the original OZ book the movie is based on but if it is like this, I won't be reading it."
4,audiobook,like it a lot. sounds good works great.it did skip a little at first but I cleaned it and it works great now.Deborah
4,There are always two sides to every story.,"This is a great piece of literature. I started reading it with a bit of hesitation, but by the second chapter was not able to put it down.I kept thinking through the whole book how in the world did the author think this story up. Granted he had a basis for this book, but this story is fully his own.Good vs evil, feminism and racial prejudice are all covered througout the story till the very end.At times I would lose the theme but by the end it tied together very well. I highly recommend this book to anyone ready to get out of the mainstream literature rut."
5,Facinated by a world existing where I never thought to look.,The story comes alive in my mind as the old tale of a land that I once percieved as one dimesional falls away exposing a world just as diverse and mysterious as the one we live in. I'm so thankful that Maguire brought us this darker ..truer to life Oz. The Wicked Witch of the West is no longer simply GREEN. Through Elphaba we are introduced to a character more alive and more free thinking than we ever could have imagined. She is a beacon of strength that shines in our minds bringing us a clearer..and much more facinating Land of Oz.
5,My favourite book,"I have always been a fan of the film 'The Wizard of Oz' and was thrilled to have stumbled across this book one day in a store. I love how this book shows a different side to the Wicked Witch of the West. This book works for me as it breathes fresh new life into a famous story and works on the principle that there are two sides to every story, a theory that I believe in.This is my favourite book by this author."
4,Read the Book and SKIP THE SHOW,"An earlier reviewer thought the book was slow, and only worth reading as a preview of the Broadway show. That reviewer even wrote ""The show takes the very best parts of the book and runs with it. But reading Wicked was painful. No doubt about that. ""Well actually, there's lots of doubt about that! I'm a musical theatre geek, and despite excellent sets, costumes and talent -- the Broadway show was dreadful. Really dreadful.I know the Tony nominating committee disagrees, but the show was absolute drivel! The adapters took a wonderful, complex novel (read it, read it!) and mousified it. They changed major plot points . . . like the ending. Do yourself a favor. Read this excellently written book. Be sure to buy a copy with the OLD pink and beige cover and not the new cover that glorifies the green and white poster from the multimillion dollar monstrosity.I hope Gregory Maguire got paid lots of money for the Broadway sell out, and uses it to write more good books."
5,"Thanks Ed, for recommending this book! :-)","The reviewer who said you will never look at Oz the same way again after reading this book was right on target! Maguire gives us a most un-wicked wicked witch in Elphaba, a green girl who is misunderstood, passionate about Animal rights, and forever plays second fiddle to younger sister Nessarose. We see a Wizard in collusion with native Oz-ians who think nothing of manipulating young women into becoming pawns of the state. The question then becomes, were Elphaba, Nessarose and Galinda merely pawns, or did they have a choice in their actions? Is Elphaba truly wicked? And what happens when a little girl from Kansas blows into town and upsets the delicate political balance that has kept this country from totally imploding on itself? A must-read for all Oz fans."
1,Save your money and your time,This is book is impossible to read and the author loves talking down to the readers with hundreds of words that most people don't know. Save your money and don't buy this.
2,Another Excuse For Evil,While loving the music from the show..The book is symbolic of what is wrong with our culture today...the philosophy that 'other people cause people to be evil'..Excuses give one persmission to fail and or to do wrong..There are countless examples of people who overcame troubling youth..Of course the cruel father was a 'minister'..I know many ministers and none of them are like that...
1,Really Really Bad,"I'm afraid I can't even spend enough time writing an in depth review of this book because I am just so glad to be done with it. I just wanted to add my vote to the one star side of the amazon spectrum. I can't believe the hype this book got away with. ah well. I was so disappointed, I wanted it to be a good book, but it was a horrible, unintelligible collection of drivel. boo. My sister kept advising that I quit trying to finish it. ""The ending isn't any better than the rest of it"" she kept telling me. And she was right. I didn't like any of the characters, they never meant anything to me. The plot was so disjointed and random, I have serious concerns about the author and his mental health. I am so happy that my life can now go on, and I can focus on new reading material. Ugh."
1,Sorry - No L. Frank Baum is MaGuire,"Despite the hype, this simply is not a good book in any way. It plodded along, failed to engage into the characters, had a convoluted and improbable plot, considering the source material, and simply ran out of plot gas. What is the adoration? The musical ain't much better (not one decent song). Such be the power of hype - and L. Frank Baum is spinning in his grave. Look was has been done to beautiful and wondrous Oz by this piker."
2,"Great idea, badly executed","Given all the great reviews and my general interest in the whole ""good/evil"" question I was really expecting a great read. He starts off great, but as the story wears on it seems to lack direction, as if the author doesn't seem to know where it's going himself. This is especially true towards the end when Dorothy appears and the episodes seem somewhat contrived to fit Maguire's original storyline.All in all it's a great idea, but it could have been better written."
1,Wicked,"I bought the book before I saw the play. Thank God I didn't read it first. After seeing the play, I started reading the book...it's hard to tell where they got their material for the play; they're not really similar. The book is very dark and a hard read. It was a stuggle to get through the book. I'm going to see the play two more times because I absolutely loved it, but would recommend to anyone who is going to see the play--don't read the book before or after!!!! Just enjoy your memories of the play."
1,"Dear 12 year olds, DONT READ THIS!","I am actually a mature 12 year old, but this book was NOT something I should have read. Although I knew what was going on, it was much to detailed. I am into young adult books, but this book was too much. Really, a book is normally more than just sex. Well this book is not. Save it for when you are older."
1,Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,"I bought this book expecting a delightful fantasy book, geared towards teenagers, but entertaining to adults as well. Boy, was I wrong. I was uncomfortable at the beginning in Gregory Maguire's explicit details of Elphaba's mother's adultrous affairs, but I got through it expecting the story to only have one way to go and that's to get better. Wrong again!! When I got to the part of the symbolic orgy involving a tiger, a drugged university student and a woman, I slammed the book shut in horror as I was reading it in public. I didn't want anyone I knew to see me reading that book. I came home, warned all of my friends about the book, and then promptly threw it in the trash. That's all that this book is good for--trash. If I could give the book 0 stars, I would. I will never buy another book by Gregory Maguire."
2,"Long, boring and disturbing","My wife and I bought the unabridged audio CD set of this book, hoping to enjoy a nice engaging story on our drive to a vacation getaway. Boy, were we in for a surprise! At 43 years of age, we've heard a lot of inappropriate language on TV and in movies, but the use of language by the characters in ""Wicked"" seemed more than inappropriate. Combine that with the disturbing descriptions of sexual thoughts/activities in the book and we began to wonder about the pedophilic tendencies of the author. We quit listening to the CDs and debated throwing them away because we couldn't think of any of our friends or family with whom we would want to share this stuff.This book is not for Christians, old people, young people or any combination thereof."
1,Very vulgar,For a book that I thought that would be like the musical very family oriented. In the first few pages I just thought it was horridly vulgar. Not a book I would recomend to any friends or family.
1,This book was ----TOTALLY AWFUL!!!,"I can't believe readers are giving this book FIVE stars! I belong to a book club and this book was chosen as one of our 'reads' because of the reviews it received and because, by the description, it sounded like it would be an amusing read. Six out of seven of us thought it was one of the worst books we've ever read. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,Not for Young Adults or Kids,"I was shocked at the most pornographical scene I have ever read. This was a scene acted out by wooden puppets, of a married man with a widow and her daughter at the same time. I was so angry to come across such filth that I stopped reading right there on page 13. I had been so excited to read it but it was not worth the effort."
3,"Tough to read, but worth it","I'd have to agree with some of the other reviewers: this book needed a better editor.There's some really great stuff in here, lot's of interesting new ways to look at Dorothy and the rest of her gang. But getting to the gems (emeralds?) is hard going, and I found myself dropping the book and picking up something else more than once while I tried to read this one.Read the book if you're an Oz fan, or if somebody loans you a copy."
2,I really tried to care...,"The whole time I was reading this book I had to struggle to maintain even a small amount of concern for the main character, the future Wicked Witch of the West. The various sections of the book which depicted different portions of her life seemed contrived and disjointed. None of the supporting characters were even remotely interesting, except possibly her sister. The constant sexual innuendo, while sometimes humerous, seemed rather randomly injected.Also, much to my surprise, there is very little similarities to the original story of Oz. And while The Wizard of Oz was a childhood classic, this book is not at all appropriate for children. Besides the sex, kids would be bored silly with all the political, religious, and philosophical discussions. All the hype for this title seems strange because despite the great concept, I found the book dull and mostly uninteresting."
2,A Must Avoid,"As a fan of Broadway musicals, I wanted to read the book before seeing the show (never heard of the book prior to the musical). There were several points while reading WICKED that I wanted to put it down and not finish it I was so offended and appalled at Maguire's writing.My wife also read it and had a difficult time with it. Recently we were talking with some other theater buffs who read the book and they threw the copy out they had purchased (fortunately, we only borrowed ours from the local library). The musical is only loosely based upon the book and the book seems to have very little relation, if any, to the original Oz. This is a book we could have done without."
2,"2-1/2 stars, really.","This book is not for everyone. I read it about a year ago; I recall mostly that I tremendously enjoyed the bawdy humor contained in the first half of the book. It took an unfortunate downhill turn after that...I put it down for a few days (hoping that I just wasn't in the mood for it that day). I returned to it because the premise of the book was SO promising that I thought it would build into a whopper. I felt I'd be missing a great literary trick if I didn't complete it. Sadly enough, I either completely missed the trick, or it just wasn't there to be had. It fell far short of what it could have been.The person I recycled the book to couldn't get interested enough to endure past 25 pages or so.Let's just say I WANTED to enjoy this book but, in truth, I didn't. I wanted it to be something...else."
1,Wicked Wasted My Week,"Wow was I disappointed in this book!!! Had heard great things about it and thought the concept would be interesting. It was the furthest thing from interesting and in fact was the worst book I've read since high school.The plot rambles with most of the book irrelevant to the ""story"". Characters come and go with no direction. They pop up, seem interesting, then they go away without much explanation.I am no author, but I think Maguire really missed out on creating a truly interesting story. Would be nice if someone else took a real crack at creating somthing intriguing.Luckily I just borrowed the book from my sister. Don't waste your hard earned cash."
2,Corruption Of A Classic,"As a child the Wizard of Oz was one of my favorite movies. It stimulated my imagination. If you are going to rework a classic you need an original concept. The idea of the Wicked Witch being misunderstood, and not truly wicked, intrigued me. In my opinion this book fell far short of it's potential. Everything that was magical in the Wizard of Oz was made mundane in this book. Fantasy was replaced with sexuality, which bored me. I felt no empathy towards any of the characters. There was nothing new and original to compare with talking trees or flying monkeys. By the end I realized what had made the original so great was how scary the Wicked Witch was. Making the witch good and the wizard evil is like rewriting the Lord of the Rings to make Sauron good and Gandalf evil. It just didn't work for me. Please Mr. Maguire, stay away from corrupting any more classics."
1,Totally Frustrating--Spoiler,"I read, and I read and I read and kept waiting to like the characters but none are likeable. I am told that so and so likes so and so but I didn't feel this in any of the characterizations. There are so many political items going on and analogies to political items I some times feel the author was venting about the injustices of the world. This book just rattled on and on and jumped around and you had to guess what happened to some of the characters. I waited for the ending and it ended. I actually felt sorry fo Elsiba. When Dorothy came in at the end of the book I probably would have felt the same way she did after all she had been through. It makes you think the Wonderful Wizard of Oz HA!!!! It ruined it for me. Needless to say this is not something I would recommend."
1,What is the big deal????,I had been wanting to read this book and was so excited to receive it as a Christmas gift last year. What a total disappointment...it took me months to get through it and I finally gave up and didn't finish it. What's the big deal??? I don't get it the huge popularity of this book and the Broadway show AT ALL. BOR-ING!!!!
3,"Promising premise, disappointing finish","I was impressed by Maguires imagination, as well as the depth and complexity of both his characters and the world he created. Many instances of terrific language and word usage as well. However, I was disappointed by the ending, which seemed rushed to me. It was as though Maguire was trapped by the original. His efforts were, to me, minimal by the time Dorothy arrives on the scene, and frankly, if he'd ended the book with her arrival, resolving the central conflicts, but leaving the original ending to resonate with the reader, I would have been more satisfied."
3,Intresting Concept...Full Potential Not Realized,"While I enjoyed reading Maguire's take on a classic tale I didn't feel that it reached its full potential. There were times when the pace was slow and I thought that it lacked a little bit of character development. By the end of the book I found myself disinterested, not really caring what was going to happen next.If you need a lot of action, character development, and a fast pace to keep you interested try something else.If you loved L. Frank Baum's stories you will probably enjoy the new perspective. It's an interesting concept and the book did keep me entertained during my flights this past summer."
5,WHAT AN IMAGINATION!,"Amazing, awe-inspiring, creative, and most of all, what an imagination! Great book! Highly recommended from this reader!I picked this up a while ago and was intrigued with the illustrations and the concept. Who would of thought? A book about the Wicked Witch of the West??!! I began reading, although the beginning was a bit slow, I finished the book in record time! Who would of thought the fear of water could be so tumultuous? Or one could sew wings onto monkeys? Or Animals could talk (or teach!!)? Or Galinda (the ""good"" witch) and Elphaba (the ""wicked"" witch) could ever be friends?What an imagination! I followed up the book by reading a few of the Oz books (just to check the ""facts""), and Maguire was right on. A bit of politics, a love story, an imaginary world, and the life of a ""witch""...who could resist? Read this book!"
3,A virtuous rendition of a favorite fiend,Some unnecessarily detailed sexual adventures and around 200 pages of pointless glut somehow bring together a last 100 pages worthy of Baum himself.
2,Couldn't be bothered to finish,"I had high hopes for this book, as I had heard so many good things about it. However, having gotten 100 pages into it (just about a quarter of the way through, as it was 406 long) and having absolutely no connection to any of the characters or concepts presented, I decided that I would rather spend my time reading something that I would actually enjoy.I can't entirely put my finger on what turned me off about the book, but I will say that the first portion - detailing the birth and infancy of Elphalba - honestly bored me to tears. It is well written to be sure, it just... wasn't... very... interesting.Perhaps it's because I really don't care too much for the Wizard of Oz in general - I somewhat doubt this, as the first two chunks of book that I read only tangentially dealt with anything I remember from the book/movie that inspired this."
2,Not what I expected at ALL,"The book isn't what I expected. I kind of expected a different twist on the Wicked Witch of the West...which it kind of was, but the author didn't really explain in depth what was going on. I was left with a ton of unanswered questions, and I'm not the type that enjoys trying to think of my own conclusions about the book. There's nothing in there about how the tin man was a victim of domestic violence, so I'm wondering why it's even on the back. It was also a very sexual book, which totally caught me offguard. There was some very descriptive parts of the book, including one particular part in which the author describes one of the characters having diarrhea. I'm not joking. I had to force myself to finish the book because there was no ""grabbing"" whatsoever. It's completely different than the play. I read the synopsis of the play and the play is more interesting than the book and also answers questions. I'd reccommend the play instead of the book."
3,Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,My son loved the book but it came to us damaged. We were highly dissapointed but we decided it keep it instead of going through the trouble of sending it back as he waited long enough for it.
5,You'll never think of the Wizard of Oz the same way again,"This book was well written and completely unique, as much a comment on society as a biography of the Wicked Witch. Maguire's story is thoroughly entertaining just as a work of fiction. Add to that his insight on our social intricacies and his excellent wordsmithing and you have a book that you can love on so many levels. It felt as though he had inside information, previously unreleased, about the truth of OZ and he was finally showing us the ""reality"" of this place and its people. I have to remind myself that the history of the Wicked Witch is his creation, not just a piece of the story that was left on the cutting room floor! I was totally impressed with Maguire's work and have subsequently read and loved all his other books."
3,"Page-turner, just don't think too hard about the plot","This book hooked me in the first two pages and I really enjoyed reading it up until the last couple of chapters, then the author threw in a pressured and cramped discussion on the nature of evil that didn't really fit into the style of the narrative but that he obviously felt was necessary to emphasize the theme of the book. Also, there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a mac truck through. A fun read over-all, I would recommend it."
4,"Elfie, we love you!","The narrative explaining the evolution of the ""Wicked Witch of the West"" is an incredibly moving tale of one woman's attempt to overcome prejudice for her and her Animal friends. She is a person born tragically different, tragically green; yet she triumphs over her apparent deficiencies with a nobility of spirit, integrity, honesty and compassion missing from most of her contemporaries. Through all of her trials of lost and failed love; lost and frailed causes Elfaba is no saint but she is profoundly human. As the book ended, it was with a sad heart that I bid goodbye to this beautiful unique spirit.George O'Donnell; Kansas City, Missouri"
4,"Wicked: The Life & Times of the Wicked Witch(""Oz, in the 21st century"")","Wonderful reading for men & women. Gives dimension to the individual characters of real interest portrayed in this book. Not just straightforward good or evil...but people who are mislead & perhaps, misread. Only downfall is listening to McGuire read his own book (editors should penalize him);also at times the story strays a bit. Greatful, ""boring Dorothy"" is merely mentioned. Overall, fascinating look at mankind through the centuries...as we harden from overexposure."
3,Warning for the conservative reader!,"I can quote the ""Wizard of Oz"" just as well as the next guy & I own the soundtrack to the musical ""Wicked"", however I was in for quite a shock when I read this book of the Land of Oz. The first 100 pages or so are basic background on the childhood of Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West), and honestly a bit dirty. As a conservative reader, I wondered what all the sexual content had to do with Dorothy Gale & the ruby red slippers. It's not the storybook Oz we grew up with, it's the harsh realities of Oz that the author perceives. Once Elphaba gets to school, the whole book takes a turn. I really enjoyed getting to know Elphaba as the heroine of the story, however I did not escape all of the sexuality- although there is a minimal amount in the middle & end of the book. On the whole, I liked the book but would not recommend it to just anyone. Oh, and the musical was only based on the book- there are many discrepancies."
4,What does it mean to be wicked?,"I second all of the comments by readers who point out the magic of the questions raised in this new telling of the old story. It really makes me wonder how many stories we have heard that were never, ever the whole story, no matter how much we thought we saw and knew. I want to add that anyone who reads this book is cheating him or herself if he or she does not follow through with the entire series. There is so much fun in this series, with the references to the familiar stories and the humor. Like any great fantasy story, the real magic is in how much we see ourselves and our own society in a world far different than our own; and these have been the very best ways to ask the most stirring questions.Far more serious and dark than the Broadway play, too. And that is a wonderful thing!I think I relate more to Elphaba than to any other literary character. What a world, what a world."
4,Better than the musical,"Well, the majority of books are better than their movie/play counterparts. I enjoyed this book a lot. The author is meticulous about choosing the exact word to fit his sentence, which required a lot of looking words up for me. It was a good, quick read."
1,I still regret the time I lost reading this book...,"This book had such potential. The plot was intriguing. The character was complex, and full of potential. However, the author spent so much time over-analyzing every detail, and commenting on society and its follies, that it was the most boring book I have read in a long time. I kept reading, hoping it would get better. It didn't. My main fault with the book is that instead of giving us a story with situations and characters that let us infer his thoughts about society and evil, etc., the author chose to verbalize and discuss those points over and over again. I find these kind of books patronizing and insulting. If I had wanted a political commentary I would have watched CNN or something. I wanted a book to challenge my mind and my views on reality (or just a good storyline) and all I got was a good sleeping aid."
4,Thankful I gave a second chance.,"After reading The Wonderful Wizard of Oz for book club, our group decided it was time to also take on Wicked, an off-shoot from the traditional tale.I had seen the musical and fell in love with the wondrous music and colorful costumes. Would the book hold true?My first attempt through this read stopped not much beyond page 75 or so. With the prompting of book club (about two years or so after my initial try), I picked the book back up and pushed through. I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed the story. And, after just reading the original L. Frank Baum tale, I was intrigued by how this book pulled from the classic movie and the original tale and then threw in its own twists and fun.A dark read with an ""evil"" nature, but utterly enjoyable. I am so thankful I gave this one a second chance!"
5,Dark and Wonderful,"If you are expecting the movie The Wizard of Oz from a different perspective you will be very disappointed.If, however, you are open minded and willing to strectch your imagination you will love this book. This is a rare piece of fiction that actually makes you think. What is evil? What is right and wrong? How far would you go to protect what you believe in? How do we, as society, treat those who are different than we are and why? and what does that ultimately say about us?I loved this book, I started it and could not put it down. I am eagerly waiting to have the time to read Maguire's other takes on classic tales."
1,Oz fan,"I have read all of L. Frank Baum's books about Oz as a kid. I loved them so much I bought all the hard back editions of them. Then a few years ago I saw ""Wicked"" on Broadway. I loved it! So I thought I would read the book to get more of a background knowing there is much that has to be left out when a book is put into a play. Whoa! Mr. Maguire did NOT need to put all the sexual parts in this book. To me it demeaned Mr. Baum's story. What a let down. I finished the book but will never recommend it to anyone. To me it was almost trash. I liked the concept Mr. Maguire had but he really went overboard. The story would have been fine without the sex."
5,An amazing amalgamation of politics and myth,"Somewhere in the enchanting story of Oz, Maguire has managed to place one of the best Utopian novels ever written. Perhaps it is the characters we knew and loved as children, steeped in adult entanglement and removed from the black-and-white simplicity of the fairy tale. Perhaps it is the intrigue and mystery of that life that I admire most, the person with the convictions and the courage to stand for the right in the face of oppression, a person who overcame horrible obstacles. Perhaps it is just excellent story-telling. Whatever it is, this book is amazing."
1,"2 strikes, you're out","Along with all the other good folks who rated this book 1 star, I found it haphazardly written, uninteresting and full of unlikeable characters.But why 2 strikes you ask me?Well, this is the second chance I give this author. I read ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister"" and felt much the same about it as this one. However since I had heard such glowing praise for this book I figured I simply picked a dud before and read ""Wicked"" hoping to understand some of the hoopla about this author. Sadly, I remain unimpressed with his work and will now proceed to never read his books again.He does pick interesting themes for his books but fails to deliver every time."
4,Wicked asks questions and delivers unexpected answers,"This book is truly a delight to read. With great character illumination we read the untold side of the ""wicked"" witch of the West. Be prepared for story lines which bother your intellect and force you to closely examine character as well as the imact that personal choices have on ones life."
4,Magically Creative,"Gregory Maguire reinvents Oz like you've never imagined it, following Dorothy's nemesis The Wicked Witch of the West. It begins with her birth and follows her life until her fateful encounter with the little girl from Kansas.Maguire instigates an entire discussion on the nature of evil with this book. The Wicked Witch, or Elphaba as she is known comes off as a heroine through alot of the book, and some of the other classic and cherished characters such as Glinda come off as merely a petulant spoiled brat. Part of the fun of the novel is how these characters beyond Dorothy's world interact, and how the land of Oz is designed with as much if not more political turmoil than what we know in our world. Richly imagined, I found the book fascinating although I did think it dragged a bit towards the end."
4,A bit slow,"I found this book to be intriguing, although a bit slow in parts. I hadn't really considered that the Wicked Witch of the West was anything but an evil character. This book helped me see her in a different light, albeit a green one."
4,Oz ain't just for kids anymore!,"Admit it, year after year you watched the movie The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to relive Dorothy Gale's plight over the rainbow. It, and the book is is based on, is a classic. But have you ever wondered about the other side of the story? The Wicked Witch was a person, too, and she had a life of her own worth telling. The novel Wicked recounts the events of her life--a life you would never have expected--from unfortunate birth to unfortunate death. It's touching, humorous, and a must read for any fan of the Oz stories."
1,Don't bother,"I got about half way through this book before I gave up completely. It's slow and it's boring. I have no idea what relevance most of the sub plots have (and there are a lot of them), the characters change completely from one chapter to the next with no real reasons, and a couple of times throughout the book I felt physically sick. I only started reading it because of the musical, but it is NOTHING like ""Wicked."" This book is not worth reading. Seriously, don't bother."
1,Wicked = Disappointing,"I waited a few weeks after finishing this book to write my review, hoping that hindsight would soften my feelings... I'm sorry to say this, but I really hated it. Generally, stories that are adapted from novels for screen or stage get destroyed in the process. Not so here. The pointless story drags on with little direction, leaving the reader wondering when the ""good parts"" are going to start. Interesting plot points that were hinted at early on never get fully developed or are completely ignored, and I spent the last few hundred pages begging for the book to end. Also, this book is NOT for children...not that it would hold their attention long enough for them to get to the objectionable material."
1,Hope the musical is better than the book....,"The concept of this book was brilliant. Unfortunately, that's where the brilliance stopped. It was at least 100 pages too long, had numerous irrelevant characters, tedious sub-plots, and included bizarre sexual scenes that were both disturbing and unnecessary. I continued to read it until the bitter end, hoping that it would somehow wrap up satisfactorily. It didn't.The good news is that I hear the musical is light, funny and engaging. The bad news is that the book is none of those."
1,Missed the mark...,"I grew up watching the Wizard of Oz on TV every Easter and have read the book many times. I was given this book to read and had heard nothing but good reviews. I was sickened and saddened that the story fell so short of my expectations. I applaud the attempt to create a pre-story (for lack of a better word) of the Wizard of Oz but found that Wicked didn't even come close. Next time, use an original story concept."
2,Wish I could say I liked it...,"I tried...I really tried to enjoy this book, but after slogging through the 400 pages, I just didn't care for it.Maybe I'm simply not smart enough, but there were times when I could not follow the story at all."
2,no pot of gold over this rainbow.,"Perhaps I began this book from the wrong perspective. This was a story beloved of me as a little girl. I truly looked forward to reading this as an adult to give me the Wicked Witch of the West's perspective. While the book does have it's humorous points, it is definitely fantasy. If you liked Lord of the Rings, you may love this. I was really disappointed in the whole thing. It wasn't what I expected at all."
2,It's poorly written but you can't help but read until the end.,"The title sums it all up. I heard so many great things about the musical for this book and therefore couldn't wait to start the book. It didn't take long for me to lose interest. The writing is confusing so that the reader doesn't have a clue as to what's going on. This begins toward the beginning, when McGuire introduces the dragon clock; even after reading until the end I still don't have a clue as to the purpose of the dragon clock. In fact, I'm not even certain what it is. The book is also rather a dark twist on the movie ""Oz."" There were times I thought I was reading a bad romance novel with Fabio on the cover. I gave it two stars because even with all its drawbacks I couldn't help but read until the end to find out what happens to Fabala. The premise of the story is interesting but it is not well executed. I've read ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister"" and found that a more enjoyable read."
4,A Wicked story from start to finish,"I had no idea what to expect from Wicked.. but it certainly didn't dissapoint.It had a few slow places through the middle, but mostly, it was spellbinding throughout. Some twists that I didn't expect, and some completely new perspectives on the entire story of the Land of Oz."
2,Inconsistent,"The first section is barely readable, but it picked up in the section section, and was fairly decent until the end, where it once again petered out.Characterization is surprisingly poor, even for the main character Elphaba.Without the context of The Wizard of Oz, and the delightful alternate viewpoint concept, I'd be inclined to rate this as 1 star. As it stands, it's an so-so novel showing a novel approach to a well-told tale."
2,Wicked,"I am about half way through this book and I have to say, after hearing such rave reviews about it I'm disappointed. I will be finishing it and hopfully it will get better. That's it!"
3,huge disappointment,It was very hard to get through this book!! To many unanswered questions and to many long drawn out boring descriptions.
4,Wicked,"What can I say... this book is... wicked!I thought the book was great. I thought the quick ending short changed the story, though."
4,"""Wicked"" is Wickedly Awesome","This story is very intriguing! It takes you through the life of our leading lady, the Wicked Witch of the West. Although some bits seem to drag, in its entirety, it is a great book. I recommend it to anyone who loves to hear the other side of fairy tales."
4,Good present for a mature reader,We purchased this book as a middle school graduation present for my daughter. We knew there was some mature sections but are confident in our daughters ability to handle that type of prose. She loved the play and liked the book as a supplement to the entire Wicked experience.
2,disappointing; poorly conceived characters,"A couple of weeks ago, I was in a bookstore, and saw this book. I read the the introduction, and liked it. However, after buying the book and reading it, I feel disappointed with this novel. Gregory Maguire had a great idea to update the story of the Wicked Witch, portray her as a heroine, and give us an Oz for adult readers. However, I feel he tried to make the story too dark, and if this book is about the nature of evil, as he posits, then he sure makes some strange claims. I also found that he had a pessimistic conception of human nature. I have read authors that could portray characters (even in fantasy novels) that resembled real human beings with seemingly genuine thoughts/actions/emotions/lives; Maguire isn't one of those authors. In his world, just about everyone is corrupt. Overall, the book was just too dark and pessimistic for me."
5,Follow this yellow brick road,"A very ntriguing concept of an oppositional view...This writer has given the reader a chance to understand the inner workings for the land of OZ...I could not put it down once I started reading this masterful work...As an avid yearly movie watcher of the Wizard of Oz, I always questioned even as a child, why there was a good witch and a bad witch...This book not only explains a concept that altered my adoration of this preconceved notion, but brought to light an alternate view...A must read for all who love the land of OZ..."
5,"Fun, intelligent read!","Brilliantly written,imaginatively gripping and insightful, 'Wicked' grabbed me and kept me ever intrigued, entertained and amazed at Maguire's amazing work! So true to our world today -- yet fun! Storybook style allowed me to enjoy the message within the fun of the fantasy world! I will never see 'The Wizard of Oz' in the same way again! Enjoy!"
1,"Wicked is ""a wicked waste of time""","I didn't like this book...I found it to be bleak, dark and boring. We all know how it's going to end, but getting there is laborious. I kept hoping it would get better, but I was disappointed - and after I finally finished it, I regretted the time I spent on it.Perhaps the musical is better, but I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Disappointing,"I got this book because I absolutely loved the musical. I loved the idea that you thought that you knew the difference between good and evil. Everything you thought that you knew is turned on its head. That's still the case with this book, but I am a fan of happy endings, and this book was missing that. I knew that the musical was loosley tied to the book, but did not realize how loosely."
2,Great idea and play...awful book!,"Honestly, I was so bored I tried to pick it up at least a dozen times over 2 months. I never made it past the first few chapters. I even tried skimming later chapters and while the story was interesting, the writing was long, drawn out and boring. I somewhat enjoyed Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister but I found it yawn-inducing as well (I did at least finish reading Confessions)."
2,Nope!,In a nutshell... I really enjoyed the begining of the book and then started to dislike it more and more untill I just returned it without finishing it. Sorry! I thought the begining was wonderful but then it jumps so fast from her parents to her in school it seemed like 2 different books and I didn't enjoy that. What happened to her parents? Why did her mother's lover die? Did her dad ever find out about the affair? Nice try.. but just didn't work for me.
5,Changes OZ forever...,"The book takes a bit to hook you, but once it does, you can't put it down. I'm a 40 year old man, and well-versed in the Wizard of Oz, alongside most of my generation.McGuire's ""Wicked"" turns the whole premise of the amazing film upside down, and helps us know why The Wicked Witch became who she is in the film. After reading the book, in many ways, she is now the hero.The messages are pertinent to our time, as Western Civilization grapples with who in the world is ""good"" and who in the world is ""wicked."" It certainly gives pause to consider who our leaders are (and perhaps should be), who are heroes are, and certainly who the real world's villains are.It's not the easiest read--definitely for 16+. But it's one of the most memorable and germain books I've ever read."
2,Disappointing,"I had read Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister and expected this book to be as good -- frankly, I was disappointed. The book reads more like a screenplay -- it's very visual, but doesn't really go into the characters the way you would expect. If you ""see"" a story when you read, this works, but for me it was a disappointment!"
1,Very disappointing!,"This book had so much potential, but in the end one of the most dissappointing books I have ever read. There were so many good ideas and plot vehicles that just went no where. Build up and build up and then no resolution, in so many situations. Even the ending offers little resolution, but just feels like the author got tired of writing."
1,Despised it,I am a voracious reader and will ordinarily finish most anything. I could not complete this book. The idea is original. The execution is poor. The narrative is choppy and the motivations of the characters make little sense. Pass this one over.
3,Interesting and Lengthy,"I really liked the idea of the book. The idea that good and evil are not on opposite ends of a linear spectrum. The book was well written and really led you to understand how a person can seem evil, but is really not evil-just has different motives that meets the eye. However, the book was a lengthy and at times tedious. Its worth the read, but understand it is definately and investment of time."
4,Wicked is just that,"I was a little hesitant in starting to read ""Wicked"" but I'm very glad that I did. It's a very interesting, thought provoking, and fun book. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading about the ""Wicked Witch of the West's"" version of the story. Very unique"
5,wonderful tale,"I happened upon this book in a bargain rack . . and what a bargain! I could hardly put it down. I usually read mysteries and suspense, but this book brought back joy in a genre I'd almost forgotten. There's plenty of suspense even though you know how the story will end. Who would've thought you could turn a wonderful movie like The Wizard of Oz (still an all-time favorite of mine) into political propaganda! Can't wait to read more by this author."
4,if you're looking for a smart read...,"This book is for you. I was introduced to the soundtrack to the musical first and after listening to it once, i ran out and bought the book. Both had been highly recommended to me. I'm almost finished with the book now and i just can't put it down! I feel so terrible for Elphaba. Everything she tries to fix, turns sour. All she wants is to be loved and to make a difference in the world, and everything seems to backfire on her. This book really makes you think about what is good and what is evil. About ambition and need and ego. McGuire takes an old tale and puts a fresh spin on it. Oz isnt so magical after all, it has the same sociopolitical and emotional problems we all face. If you're interested in a smart read, this is the book for you!"
4,Wicked - Definitely Wicked,"One of the most phenomenal books I've ever read. Maguire not only clears the ""Wicked Witch of the West's"" name but actually turns her into one of the most powerful female characters ever by showing us her life, her beliefs, and the steps that led to her eventual (and what turns out to be accidental) demise. He is able to provide us with two vastly different sides to the traditional tale of ""The Wizard Of Oz"" and make you question your original beliefs about who was good and who was evil.Twisters as well as twists in the plot of the book pop up throughout and cause chaos not only in the Land of Oz, but also in the minds of the readers. But not to worry, most questions are answered by the end of the book...but Maguire definitely still leaves A LOT to the imagination."
4,Never the Same,"After reading the book, ""The Wizard of Oz"" isn't the same. ""Wicked"" explored the Wicked Witch of the West's past to the point beyond ever imagining her to be ""wicked."" Maguire does a fantastic job of creating a whole new story but also sticks to the original set up. He made me think about what really good is and what evil is just from writing about the entire background of the Wicked Witch of the West. The reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was because this book is so overwhelming. There is so much in this book that it makes me stop and take in everything that just happened. If he would have taken more time in explaining everything that was new, the book would get 5 stars. Great book overall."
3,Novel but disappointing,"I started off this book enjoying it for it's novelty. Then I started to enjoy it for it's descriptions and it's complex world you don't usually associate with OZ. The Animal rights, the complex religious dogma, the social classes, etc. Really enjoyable and different, something to sit down and read for it's own merits not just because it's novel. Upto the middle of the book. Then, when 'wicked' went to the Emerald city and stayed I found that the book just dragged on and on. After what I found to be a forced chapter (and a big one) I just couldn't get back into it. The middle of the book annoyed me so much I actually thought about stopping (very rare for me) but I persisted. The book did get better after that, but the damage was done. Though amusing and some innovative adeas of the 'beloved' land of OZ and our 'wicked' witch, the magic was gone, leaving you wondering if it was magic at all or just an illusion of a good book."
5,A must read for any fan of the Wizard of Oz,"Anyone who has read this book will never be able to look at the movie the same way again. Delightfully humorous with intersting dark twists that keep you captivated throughtout the entire book. It's hard to sometimes determine if Elphaba, the wicked witch of the west, is truly evil or just misunderstood and is honestly good. The depiction of other characters that are seen in the movie puts everything in an entirely different light. The good witch Glinda really a spoiled selfish socialite?, and the Wizard a tyrant terrified of his home back on earth? What s the difference between animals and Animals and what is the connection? So many questions brought up and the only way to have them answered is to read the book and see for yourself."
2,poor,"i direct this to those who saw the musical and am planning to buy this book because of how great they thought the musical was. well i recommend you save your money to watch the musical again and not waste it on this book. i, like some, bought this book after falling in love with the play and found myself gravely disappointed. this book lacks good editing and has many unneccessary plots [urinating, sex, rape, etc.]let's just say, the producers and writers of the musical cleaned this book up. they took out the tasteless plots and added enjoyable events. don't dim your experience with the show by wasting your money on this book. the musical did what what this book couldn't: make this story great."
2,I'm not quite sure what the hype is about,"I bought this book because of the excellent reviews the author received. I picked it over Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister because I found the premise more intriguing. However, I found the characterization and dialogue uninteresting. The plot was dull even in the places that it was unpredictable. I think it might appeal more to those who identify themselves primarily as readers of romance, rather than as readers of fantasy, as the romance aspects of the novel were its best conceived parts."
5,"Oh, Ye of Little Imagination...","... don't read this book if you expect -- or need -- a simple re-hashing of L. Frank Baum's books, or if you are afraid to see something other than the movie's screenplay. But if you want more than those, if you want something deeply layered and highly imaginative, then by all means read ""Wicked"". It's a masterful fantasy."
4,Here's the thing ...,"Readers who loved the original WoO may be disappointed in a darker, more adult ""Wicked"", and readers who've been served up too much of the publicity hype are going to feel that it was overrated. Not to mention all the fantasy readers who feel that Maguire doesn't cover any new ground. Given their biases, they've all got legitimate points of view.Me, I'm somewhere in the middle. I brought it to my book group and consequently, they felt they'd ""discovered"" it, and they really enjoyed it. Really, they all loved it, and they don't ALL love anything, except for maybe ""The Sparrow"" (Mary Doria Russell).Maguire is a clever writer, and he's fleshed out Oz in a pretty complete way. Although it's not without flaws, ""Wicked"" is so much better written than so much of what gets printed today, it's not surprising that so many people really took to it.I liked it too."
3,Abrupt Ending,"Great book throughout, kept wanting to know more. However, ended far too abruptly, leaving me with a whole lot of unanswered questions."
3,Is it over yet?,"I like the concept of the story, and there were some good parts. However, it seemed to drag on and never end."
1,"Zero stars, actually","Self-important, pretentious and unnecessary. I struggled mightily to reach the end and almost lost it when I got to the 14 ""Reader's Group Guide"" questions. It's not bad enough that I lost all those hours of my life reading this book? There are people that waste even more hours discussing the ""nature and roots of evil"" and the ""Shakespearean or Greek tragedy"" elements of this book? I'll admit, the premise is intriguing, but the execution is very disappointing. I finally threw a bucket of water on the thing, hoping it would dissolve."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS BOOK!!","(Real Rating: 0 stars)I'm a reader. I've been one since the 1st grade (about 50 years ago). I've read hundreds (thousands?) of books. I've finished all but 2. This was one of the 2 I didn't finish. Trust me, a book I don't get thru is REALLY bad. This is one horribly written book.WICKED (the musical) is phenomenal. As has been noted by others among these reviews, the book and the musical are nothing alike. See the musical, skip the book.(Mr. Maguire is truly fortunate that his premise for the book was so good that a wonderful musical could be made from it. Now he gets to make money from someone else's fabulous execution of that idea. It's too bad his execution of the same idea is so terrible.)"
2,philosophical blather and burlesque comedy,This book offers a peculiar mix of philosophical blather and burlesque comedy. I give it one star because the writing is good enough to draw you in but then leaves you high and dry. The other star is earned by the characters of Nanny and Amah Clutch (I'm not sure about the spelling of Amah Clutch as I listened to this book).
1,Terrible book,"I was very excited when I found this book, it sounded interesting and so full of potential. I struggled to read it. I really wanted it to be good but at best it was boring and at worst it was vulgar. Do not waste your time or money on this sorry excuse for a book."
5,Wicked is Wicked!,"Imagination can never have been as great as that of Gregory Maguire in this enchanting take-off from ""The Wizard of Oz."" See the Broadway show - then read it again. You'll understand even more~"
4,Sunpak 2003 Pocket Tripod,"This mini Sunpak 2003 Pocket Tripod is adorable and functional. Arrived on time. The product is not top quality, but it is listed at the right price. I would purchase this product again and I recommend it."
2,Cheap and lightweight,I would only use this tripod for very small lightweight cameras. It is not very sturdy. Noticeable vibrations when recording video.
3,Not as expected,"Spa Sister Relaxing Dead Sea Salts with Lavender Essential Oil, Sunflower Oil & Vitamin E 453g/16ozA good cleansing product but does not smell like lavender. Don't know exactly what the fragrance is, but nothing like lavender. Go back to the drawing board on the fragrance. Other than that I like the product. Will not purchase again because the fragrance is misleading and do not like being mislead."
5,very nice product for a good price,"I gave this product for a gift and the recipient loves it. She has asked where to buy more, which is a great endorsement. It has a great scent and dissolves readily in warm water. Excellent price; would expect to pay more at a bath-and-body shop."
3,Funkie Read Funkie Pickle!,"The book I am reviewing is Do the Funky Pickle by Jerry Spinelli. In the book Eddie tries to be cool by making up a dance to attract a girl he likes. The problem is that Eddie attracts the wrong girl. Her boyfriend says he will beat him up on Friday. This is a great book. I give it three out of five stars. I would recommend this book to everyone.Emerson, NJ Fifth Grader"
1,Do The Funky Pickle,I ORDERED AND PAID FOR THIS BOOK BUT DID OT RECEIVE IT!! WHY? HOW CAN I REVIEW IT?? Paul Maccaro
1,Chem. text book,"I knew it would be used, but a lot of the answers were written or circled already. Not great when you're trying to prep. for a test. So I was disappointed."
5,Awesome soap and extra goodies!,"I've been using this soap for a couple of years now, and it feels amazing! It moisturizes without making my skin feel greasy and it doesn't smell like chemicals or eventually dry me out like some ""moisturizing"" soaps do once I get out of the shower. Plus, Vitacost included a free bag of honey almond cookie bites (which were awesome!) and a catalog of other cool stuff they sell. Usually I don't like it when sellers do that, but usually it's a bunch of crap I don't want or need, so it worked out this time. Thanks!"
2,Make a great wireless switch and a lousy router...,"If you disable DHCP you can turn it into a great wireless switch but you need a router between it and the internet. I use a cheap Vonage router and it works much better than the FVG318. FVG318 has constant bugs, ""cable disconnected"" repeatedly on all computers, no Windows 7 on the one I bought, can not get to many popular sites, silly. Crap...but a great dumb switch."
2,Decent product but has some challenges,Purchased this device with another Netgear device(same type just without wireless) to perform a site to site vpn as well as manage my network. I had some stability issues with this device as well as the VPN would almost always drop. Most of the time I had recycle the device to get it back. I eventually had to replace these devices as they where not meeting my needs. I had contacted netgear support there response was to reapply the same firmware and test again. Eventually gave up and purchased Zywall's to replace these and am extremely pleased with them.
2,"Solid features, but lacking stability","This product has great features and easy setup, along with plenty of ports to connect to (8) which is especially good for a home network with lots of connections. Problem is that the interface seems buggy and sometimes the system does not respond to changes (i.e. mac address access list additions) without rebooting. Sometimes the wireless network drops out entirely. Not too often, but often enough for me to look for another more stable solution. I'm doing web development from home and have vonage ip phone where a stable internet connection is a must.This review is based on the v2 version of the product."
1,Garbage,"That bad taste in your mouth, it's Hell Rell. He's decent as a featured artist but trashy solo. Dipset you know better than this."
4,Mailbox,"I like the mailbox, it looks great and not like everyone else in the neighborhood. It would have been better if it came with screws!!"
2,Waste of effort,I would not recommend using this or any adhesive to mend torn clothing. It really cannot repair tears in material as well as needs to be for the article of clothing to be useful again.....throw away the clothes and buy new ones.
5,More than Fishing,"Contrary to other reviews, one need not be a native of the Adirondacks to love them. This book covers much more than fishing, it conveys the respect and love of the area felt by each of the writers.As a regular visitor to the Adirondacks, I enjoyed this book as a treatise on the beauty and uniqueness of the area more than a ""carved in stone"" fishing guide.Read the book to enjoy the experience. It's well worth it.Tom"
3,Incredibly Loud!,"Good:Vacuums nicely.Dirt Devil bags are easy to find.Has worked for years - nothing broken yet.Bad:INCREDIBLY loud! This is by far the single loudest vacuum cleaner I have ever owned or been around. And it's not just white-noise / machine-noise loud, this sucker has got a shrill, piercing whistle to it that leaves your ears ringing and your head aching after vacuuming. One might think I sucked something into the machine to get that whistle, but nope, it had that sound fresh from the box and I've searched for the source. It's just that loud.I'd recommend buying something else if you value your hearing."
1,Get what you pay for,"I have owned two of these Dirt Devil Featherlites(bought new) and they both came with problems. Yes they do suck! My first was okay but then had issues with blowing dust everywhere(even after a new bag change) and then burning smells. My second just called it quits today, it has already been in the shop for an overhaul but this time around the motor sounds like it's going to fall out and smells like it's on fire. Nice hazard waiting to happen. It's going out to the curb today! I won't be buying another Dirt Devil because we have not had any luck with them. You definitely get what you pay for."
1,This is the worst vacuum I've ever used.,This vacuum has minimal suction from the beater bar.The attatchments do however work.
1,Louder than god,"The vacuum is louder than god. If you don't want to go deaf, do not buy this vacuum."
5,Use them all the time.,They work well for dust. Being a masonry tuckpointing contractor around the Chicago area I use these filters with a full face mask.You can knock the dust out of them a few times but eventually need to be replaced.
5,Great for wood and/or metal working.,"After using the paper masks that do not seal up well around my face and fog up my glasses with every breath, I tended to not use masks at all. For wood working, that left me in a very dusty environment that would make me sneeze quite a bit. Then I did some metal work with a grinder that I bought from Amazon. It smelled terrible, and later when I blew my nose it came out black.That convinced me to buy the 3M 7500 series half mask along with these filters. These filters work very well. Whether I'm doing wood working like cutting or sanding, or I'm grinding away, I can breath easy. These filters are so effective that I can't even smell what I'm working on until I take the mask off.Also, for reference, the 4-pack is 4 pairs of filters, not just 4 filters. My mask uses two of these at a time, so this ends up being 4 complete change outs, not just two, making it an even better deal."
3,Particulates only........,Do not use these for mold remediation. Use the 2097's as these will not filter out the ammonia and Mold Control vapors like the 2097's.
5,HOTTTTT SONG,"Gets you pumped, gets you energized, makes you feel like you just did chest and back at the gym and could still squeeze out legs, get this!!!!"
1,Grundig pocket radio,Received this as a Christmas present and it's going to be returned. Find the reception extremely poor!
3,"Great SW, the rest ???","I was looking for an all-in-one small Sw MW FM radio for my many walks of dogs. Above all this radio provides a very enteraining SW array. My neighbor,an old time SW fanatic,was amazed at this radio's SW performance.I think that this unit's MW (AM) performance is just short of intolerable. It's FM performance is OK. I am looking forward to the improved MW performance of the much thriftier Sony ICF-S10MK2, though as of this writing I am not in the possession of the above unit. It just has to be be better. The tuning is so fine on the Grundig that it is nearly impossible to really tune a station that you know the number of, mostly in MW.In closing, I think that this may be the best SW hand-held tuner on this earth, but for much else there are better options. I will carry two radios on most of my next dog walks, as there is a time for all things. And there is a radio for all times. The choice is yours. Heavy HuH"
4,Great Little Radio,"This Grundig Mini radio is just what I expected. Great reception on all bands and I love the feel of the radio. The fine tuning has a tendency to drift sometimes but not enough to be real concerned about. If you want a great little radio with am,fm and short wave this is the one. I love this radio!"
4,"Good, Not Perfect","A good little unit. However, the tuning knob is so sensitive that it makes locking in a station difficult. Overall good though."
2,Wasn't as expected!,"I picked this radio after many hours of going over reviews. When I openned the package it felt cheap! The band selector moved up and down with too great of easy. Didn't know which band I was in. Am reception was good. FM reception was excellent. Shortwave reception was terrible in my house, regardless of the room I went to. The reason I returned it was that it would not shut off. I had to remove the batteries to shut it off!Now looking for a portable shortwave radio again."
2,frustrating,"i'm here looking for a different radio, because i've had it with the freakishly sensitive tuning on this unit. it is difficult to locate the station you want and then heaven forbid if a puff of wind should blow on the tuning dial! because you will lose your station! there are no presets which would make life much easier. maybe someone with more patience would have better luck!"
2,A piece of junk.,"This is an update to what I bought about six months ago. It's a shame to a good name like Grundig. It sounds awful with its built in speaker as well as with any headphone. It is difficult to tune in stations because the analog tuning wheel does not have the right resistance to make it to the right frquency. It either under-tuned or over-tuned, but never right on. On weak stations, all you hear is noise. Compare with Sangean radios, it's like day and night. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk, get a Sangean DT 210."
3,A handy radio,I found this radio to get good reception. The only problem is that the dial doesn't stay in tune consistanly. I prefer the older model I have which was slightly bigger but had digital tuning.
2,BEST $5.00 RADIO I EVER BOUGHT,"Grundig sold out. Hard to tune. If it would have been $5.00 w/free shipping, it would be a pretty good deal."
5,best little gadget,"for the price it is the best, ii is small but loud and digital which is very nice. have not tried the worldband but i know i will like it too.great buy"
5,Very pleased with Grundig am/fm/sw hand held radio,"Hi I am the proud owner of a Grundig mini 300PE am fm shortwave hand held radio. I am very pleased with the reception on all bands , the clarity and ease of use of this product.For its size it has loud volume with its 20 inch retractable antenna,clock and alarm function.It sports a beautiful carry case with an operation manual fitting compactly together inside with the radio and ooh there is a headset port.I will definitely remain with this brand name and recommend it to anyone interested in a top of the line product.Andy Wong- Trinidad & Tobago,West-Indies."
