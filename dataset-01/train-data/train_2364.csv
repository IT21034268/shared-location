5,Paladin Better than anything on TV now,I enjoy the westerns of my childhood. As in my title these shows are better than today's shows. they have a Class that is sorely lacking in modern TV and Movies.Charles
5,Fantastic,Great picture. This TV has plenty of inputs and very easy to use. Sound is very good which is good since I don't always use my surround sound speakers. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,db/pff,Useful for doubling shooting time for Readylite 20 Videolight. But takes too long to recharge.
2,Charging to long for 15 Mins,"For only 15 minutes of light you need to charge this battery for 5 hours,this Battery is only 600Mah - Sunpak needs to use higher Amp batteries,The light works well the battery don't"
4,What if Robert Rodriguez created a video game?,"Total Overdose is a game that takes some of the most fun aspects of gaming today, tweaks them, and sets them in Mexico. You play as Ram, an ex-con who is given a second chance by his brother Tommy, a DEA agent, who was injured while trying to expose a drug cartel. Ram takes on the tasks set forth by his brother and sets out to expose the cartel.The game plays just like a combination of Max Payne moves, a free-roaming enviornment, and offers you multiple ways to take down drug dealers/lords. The story will keep you entertained as you learn what happened to your father, who is responsible for betraying you and what is in store for Ram. Furthermore, the music is some of the best that I've heard for a game (the intro alone will have you coming back to the game just to hear the music). I highly recommend this fun and addictive game."
3,A good value,"A decent, sturdy enough bag and hanger for moderate use. I was hoping to use it on a smaller linen cupboard door but found it does require a full-size one. Still, I consider it a good value for the cost."
5,Great bag,"Got this bag as alternative for my husband to collect/hold his shirts for the cleaners to be laundered. There was no room or need for another clothes basket and no need. This is perfect, he loves it!"
4,Perfect product,I ordered 2 of these hamper bags. They have been lifesavers!! They have been the perfect solutions to my son's small bedroom and bathroom!!
5,pre code sex comedy,"For the sign of the times this movie is a great classic... It is very suggestive in every comical way possible with out vulgarity or nudity.... Kinda like an ealier ""Three's Company "" but with 2 guys and a girl instead of 2 girls and a guy... I truly loved this and would recomend it to everyone who enjoys early 1930's pre code movies..."
1,lubitsch out of touch!,"I saw a couple of this director's films (Trouble in Paradise/Ninotchka) and had great fun but this one based on a Coward play was so boring. The two lead actors, Cooper and March, were miscast--I would rather watch them playing serious dramas. Well, for the devoted fans of Mr. Lubitsch this movie would probably be funny."
5,just perfect,My niece loved them. she is a huge licorice fan and dog fan so the combination was just right for her.
3,Way too sweet for me,I like black licorice with a more robust flavor. This licorice is very sweet and has a mild licorice flavor. I don't recall if other reviews were similar to mine. I'll keep looking for black licorice that meets my needs. Wish I knew what brand my last Scotty Dog licorice was - it was the best!
5,scottie dogs,the scottie dogs are very good licorice. i'm glad to have purchased them.they are hard to find.they where at a resonable price.i would buy them again.
5,Great Product. Very Happy,Very happy with the product. Great pair of flip flops for every day use. I advise dont be deterred by the price of the item. They look like theyre gonna last a while.
5,Cool Thong Sandals,"Well made and a great color. Still in the break-in period. Many of the Rainbow Thongs takes awhile for this. However, the Rainbow 3o1 ALTS Single-Layer or the 302 ALTS Double Layer Smooth Top Leather Thongs, are the exception to this!! Always Order 1x Larger Than You Normally Wear-For Overall Flip Flop Comfort."
1,If u like sweaty feet...,"These sandals make my feet very sweaty, they are also bumpy & uncomfortable.I'm sorry, but they r not good for me."
2,Great Sandal High price No Warranty,"No slam on this seller. Don't pay extra money for this product because the manufacturer will not honor the ""lifetime"" warranty they offer as a selling point. Bought the Rainbow Sandals for my husband at a pricey beach store and seriously overpaid, but they fit well and came with a ""lifetime"" warranty. Don't believe it and don't bother to pay shipping to have defective shoes sent to the manufacturer. The shoes we returned were two years old and were clearly delaminating and all we got was a gee sorry letter stating if we wanted the defective shoes back we would have to pay for return postage..The delamination was never mentioned. This product is NOT worth the xtra $$. The warranty is bogus!"
1,Not good,"I bought these sandals because I've always heard that the Rainbow brand is the best. I wore them ONCE for about 2 hours at the beach at night, and when I took them off, I was shocked to see that the sandals had peeled the skin off my feet. My feet were covered in blood and my skin was exposed. I felt a bit uncomfortable when I first wore them but thought that was normal for new sandals. It was far worse when I took them off. It took about 2 weeks for my feet to heal completely and what's worse is that it kept me from doing the regular exercise I normally do. I swim, run, and play tennis and couldn't do any because of the damage the sandals did to my feet."
3,"Uncomfortable at first, but they wore in",These sandals are decent. At first I was unhappy with them as they were pretty uncomfortable out of the box. They thong of the sandal cut into my feet and caused them to bleed. However after I broke them in they became pretty comfortable and now i wear them often. If you can overlook the break in period they are a good pair of flip flops. The sizing is accurate.
4,Rainbow Classic,"Rainbow Classic SandalsRainbow fans will love these flops. The break-in is way faster than the leather soled Rainbows, mere weeks in contrast to the months it takes when I break in a new pair of learther soled. Hope this helps."
3,"good book to learn about design principles, kind of disorganized though","This book is excellent for understanding what makes a successful product and how to design a new product for success. Maybe surprisingly, I found some of the principles also applicable to software programs and their UI front-end.On the other hand, the material in the book feels a bit disorganized. The first chapters are the most interesting, but towards the end the book becomes more abstract. Especially the chapter on robots of the future feels a bit out of place.Having said that, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand why iPods have become such a success :)"
4,An interesting view about how products can change our lives,"Don Norman with this books exposes a review based on how products can make us feel better, and how they can influence our daily life in different contexts of use. If you're lookin' for a tutorial about ""how make an emotional product"", this is not the choice. Nevertheless, you'll never find it eather. Norman only puts a name to a phenomenon that already exists, but in a entertaining way that offer to the reader a new form to understand the design of products. It is worth it to read this, absolutely recommended."
3,good but not fun,"I really like this topic, but i found the book a little hard to read because some parts can be boring.It's a good book"
4,What are we designing again ?,"This book has two halves to it.The first half is rather useful introduction to a psychological theory of emotional cognition. The author consciously simplifies things to make it simple to read and understand. A designer of pretty much anything could benefit by reading it.Sadly, the second half goes way off the course. It discusses the possible future of machines and robots, touches Azimov's laws, and simply put goes in circles. The whole second half can be summarized in a single sentence: ""The intelligent robots aren't there yet, but they will be, and when they are, humanity is changed to accomodate"".The design of the book itself is marvellous (who'd expect ?). The language is very clear.Although I expected more from Mr. Norman's books, this one is just about worth reading, therefore 4 out of 5."
3,Everyday Emotions?,"Donald Norman's in depth look at things we use everyday makes you really think. You begin to analyze everyday objects. The book is all about the intention of an object and how an object is designed, which makes that object what it is. The book introduces and is laid out by the three aspects, or levels, of design: visceral, reflective, and behavioral. The examples and case studies are interesting reads that keep you involved. Yet, still left unanswered questions. The book could have done with out the last chapter on robotics that reads like an eerie science fiction narrative."
3,More Theory than Practice,"I love Donald Norman. I love the work he does, and I love what he's taught me. I got so much from The Design of Everyday Things. I got something out of Things That Make Us Smart. I didn't get much out of this one at all.I think this is because I'm an impatient reader. For example, I don't read fiction. I want to read facts about things I can apply in a practical way. This book is much more about theory than practical applications.I'm sure some people love reading theory, and they will love this book. But if you're like me and really want a book to deliver information you can use on every page, you should buy The Design of Everyday Things instead, if you haven't already."
3,"Easy read, but repetetive","Donald Norman has always written ""usable"" books. Easy to read and full of anecdotes and examples that nearly everyone can relate to. His classic work, The Design of Everyday Things, still sits proundly on my bookshelf; I pull it down a couple times a year when I need a mental refreshment.This book, like its predecessors, is a fast read. It is written at a low level and nothing in it is too hard to grasp. However, it is too long. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs simply because Normas was repeating something he had written just a few sentences back. I feel the book could be half its length and not lose any content.It's also not as inspirational as his previous books. There were none of the ""a ha!"" insights that permeated The Design of Everyday Things or Turn Signals Are the Facial Expressions of Automobiles.Still, it's a good read. The next time I'm in the store, I'll be more cognizant of the reasons why I prefer one brand over another of otherwise identical products."
3,Paradoxical essay on the author's own personal experiences,"This was the first Michener book that I have read, but since he is so highly regarded, I will assume it is not his best work. Although he does present many of the major problems facing our nation today, I often had trouble understanding which side of the issue he supported. He seemed to contradict himself throughout the book on several issues. While the book might be considered somewhat thought-provoking, I found many of the questions posed to be rhetorical and the ""1,2,3"" answers were too vague and simplistic for such complex problems. This book was a lifetime of observations, not solutions."
5,Very nice read,"Michener offers some compelling insights into what he considers to be the most critical problems facing our country today,it may seem simplistic at times, but life is simple if you let it be."
4,Relive the show,"Saw this production on Broadway - CD is excelelnt and whilst not the same buzz as being there, as good as it gets"
5,Fiddler,"This is a great musical. Although I have not seen it on stage, but I have seen the movie, and love it. So I bought the new cast recording, and love it as well!!It's about a Jewish Russian Family and their ""traditions"" that they will NEVER go against, until his daughters go to him and say they want to marry the person they want to marry instead of having an arranged marriage. then they are forced out of their little town an d sing a heart-wrenching (spelling?) song about them leaving.All and all, it is a GREAT musical!!!"
5,Best Dog Friendly Magazine,"Fido Friendly Magazine is a favorite for this dog lover. The product recommendations have helped me choose the best items for my pups and the resort reviews, (loved the review of the Heathman Hotel in Portland, OR), make my travel plans fun, especially for my furry friends. I look forward to every issue and enjoy the visual and verbal excellence produced by the writers and the publisher. Fido Friendly has unleashed a great magazine!"
1,No new magazines received since 2011,"I loved Fido Friendly and have always looked forward to receiving it. I renewed my subscription in September 2011 and received one copy (I believe it was in October or November). That was it ... nada, nothing after that. I called Fido Friendly earlier this Spring, was told I'd get the next issue shortly, and never received anything. Finally after more than 7 or 8 months without receiving any magazines I cancelled my subscription and asked for a refund.FWIW I'm giving 5 STARS to Magazine Customer Service ... Amazon.com Magazines ... Synapse Services which handled the subscription. They were on top of my cancellation request and within 24 hours I got a notice that a refund had been credited to my account!!!"
2,Very Disappointed,"While the magazine in and of itself is quality work, the delivery wasn't on par. What 5 issues in one year? I think we received one out of those five. Originally the subscription was to give us information on traveling with our dog. .. . But I found it wasn't as helpful as I thought it'd be. I won't recommend this magazine and I won't reorder it --"
3,One True Voice,"James Hand belongs to the tradition of solitary, stoic American males. In literature, the best example is Hemingway's work done before ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"". In modern cinema, perhaps the only example is Clint Eastwood's last few films as a director. And in the field of country music, the early and late work of Johnny Cash stands with them. Like them, Hand's art depends of authenticity and simplicity: you feel he would rather die than lie, his songs working as hard won synecdoches, making you feel his world is just too deep for words."
3,James Hand,"James Hand is now my favorite country music singer/song writer. But, unlike the critics, I rate his new disc, Shadow on the Ground, as his best. Not only is the quality of the recording noticeably superior, but the scope and depth of his songs and his singing is shown off to maximum advantage. Bottom line; if you like country music don't miss either of these two small wonders."
2,Not much to this game,This is basically an Unreal Tournament clone with tanks. No single player experience to speak of. A waste of money.
4,Chatty Cathy has almost met her match,"I like the doll. Now here's the but. My toddler is not enthused. She's 4 and had about 10 minutes of genuine interest. Now I have to egg her on to play with it. The review that said the hand movement gets irritating after a while was dead on. i gave 4 stars because I adore the concept. The doll is well made, the soft legs actually make dancing easier when you hold her hands,and as a big kid myself I do regress and play with her sometimes so she's got appeal. All chidren are different so for the money if you have a ""dolly"" lover it's a good buy."
1,Give me a break,"Being a frequent traveler myself, I picked this book up expecting some insight into the travel industry. I was utterly dissappointed. This book is useless. Many things the author writes about don't even make sense, as mentioned in another review about exiting through the arrivals area. Even those who know nothing about flying etc should not, for any reason, buy this book."
2,No specifics,"Ok, so if you want to know tales about travel, then this is your book. However, if you want specifics on how to save money and travel in style, this is NOT for you."
4,awesome book!!,"This was a realy cool, informative book for those who travel a lot. Ever been to a hotel and the water pressure in your shower is non-existent? This book teaches you how to get the room with ""fire-hose-pressure"" in the shower, and much much more! Lots of great, useful tips to make your traveling better, whether you are going by plane, cruise ship or by car! Check it out!"
1,Pedantic and unorganized,"Why a writer would chose to insult his readers is a mystery. Perhaps that is why he is the ""Detective.""His attitude towards not only the travel industry, but the READER as well, is so negative as to make this book almost unreadable.Actual travel tips are few and far between.Don't bother buying this one."
4,why are there so many angry reviews?,I am a frequent traveler who found the book interesting and informative about many seemingly illogical aspects of traveling the airlines. I suspect the angry reviews are from travel industry insiders who object to Greenberg's snarky tone.
1,Did this book have an editor?,"Like a few of the other reviewers, I too read this book with a highlighter. However, I didn't find many useful tips to highlight. Instead I marked hundreds (literally!) of grammar mistakes, typos, etc. I don't believe that the manuscript made any stops between typewriter and printing press. The author and publisher should be embarrassed. I plan to send in my marked-up copy to them (the text is useless, anyhow). However, I don't expect that a second edition will ever be printed. Aside from the poor writing and editing, the book had few useful hints for anyone with any travel experience. I fly over 100,000 miles a year, and I know better tips than those suggested, and I also know that some of his tips are obsolete."
2,Stop Complaining,"There are quite a few good tips in the book, but all of them could have been combined into two chapters. The author seems to ramble on about all of his travel problems, things that have happened to him. That's great if you show us an example, but not a third of each chapter. Also, there is a lot of redundent info. For instance, the chapter about crusie lines buying used boats and renaming them and saying ""New to our fleet"" as to inply that the ship is brand new not an old ship. He goes through about 30 examples of this.. One would have been enough."
1,Tell me something NEW!!!,"I found this book to be filled with cliché's and worn out information. Peter is a great correspondent however, in this book he restates the obvious, and relies heavily from a previously published travel book, the Penny Pincher's Passport to Luxury Travel. Both books provide good information although I feel that the Penny Pincher's Passport provides more real life tools to enhance service."
1,Same Old Same Old,"I found this book to be filled with cliché's and worn out information. Peter is a great correspondent however, in this book he restates the obvious, and relies heavily from a previously published travel book, the Penny Pincher's Passport to Luxury Travel. Both books provide good information although I feel that the Penny Pincher's Passport provides more real life tools to enhance service."
1,Waste of time for anyone with travel experience,If you have very little travel experience you may be able to get something out of this book but for the rest of the world it is a waste of time.
3,Not Great,This book is mostly about airlines. I was hoping for it to be more about hotels and how to get good service. I guess I should have found some reviews before buying the book. A lot of the information is older and you can't use now because of the changes made. I just would get this book from the library or the bargain book bin.
2,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS....,"If you know absolutely nothing about ways to get good travel deals, this book is an excellent place to start learning about them.If you know ANYTHING about travel deals, do not buy this book. It is patronizing and useless."
1,Just isn't worth it and has only done more harm than good,"After coming across it as a featured book in B&N, I was pretty intrigued and it looked like a pretty darn good book.But really, all of your advantages have been totally wiped out. When these loopholes were new, it worked because literally nobody knew about it. Now, it was so widespread, the companies closed every open loophole.Greenberg's strategies are actually risky. Hotels and airlines aren't happy with those trying to manipulate their systems, and you actually pay more than save more while risking your memberships in any affinity programs, clubs, etc.Not to mention throwing in the outrageous price of the book itself.The Travel Detective is just like one of those ""free money"" sales pitches on TV. It doesn't do any good and has only done lots of harm. The inside is everything and anything BUT what it looks to be on the cover."
1,"Looking for the ""beef"" (info)","I found this book to have about a three page hand-out of useful tips and several hundred pages of travel ""war"" stories. If you have NEVER flown on an airline, it will scare you to death. If you have, there is nothing new."
1,95% worthless,"Given the massive changes in airline policies and security since 9/11, the vast majority of the advice in this book is no longer applicable. Greenberg focuses so much on flying - almost 240 of the book's 375 or so pages of content - that you'd think there was nothing more to travel than the flight. There's also a bizarre jump from an abbreviated pet-friendly lodging section (a whopping two paragraphs) smack into the middle of a discussion on how to get the best deal on a hotel room. Clearly, whoever edited this cut a big chunk out, and deprived the reader of who-knows-how-much information. There are some useful tips and hints in here, but not enough to justify owning it."
3,More Entertaining than Useful,"There is little information that's useful in this book for a traveller who wants to get the best service and the best deals. There are some VERY interesting anecdotes that give background about why different things happen, or how things came to be--For instance, until reading the book I had not understood the idea behind the airlines that remove seats from their aircraft (as American is now doing, and TWA did a few years ago). The few new ideas I saw weren't followed up on--For instace, ""Use repositioning flights to travel long distances at cheap rates"" but with no information on how to search out such flights from the wealth of flight information available on the internet. Unless you are a total novice at this stuff, I don't think you'll learn much that is useful in achieving the goals listed in the title. If you ARE a novice of that type, the book is okay."
1,Get Real,"I have been a traveler for over 20 years, and I have seen many changes in the travel industry. What I know for certain is that this book is completely unrealistic and by following this advice you are certain to end up paying more for your travels. Today's travel environment is such that airlines and hotels are not putting up with those who try to manipulate their systems. More specifically following these TRICKS will result in losing your frequent flyer accounts, club memberships,or even air tickets-resulting in the need to pay a full fare to continue on your trip as well as, any number of sanctions that the travel industry can impose. Over, my past 20+ years of travel, I have found many great and legitimate ways to save money, never having to compromise my integrity and values. Therefore, I caution one about following the advice within this book."
4,Getting better all the time,"The series begins to take shape in LW&C2. I found the first volume repetitive due to the similar narrative structure employed throughout every chapter, but I mind that structure less and less in Vol. 2 as the characters develop. I'm hoping Vol. 3 continues this trend."
5,Great Quality,This is the 2nd in a series of short snapshot stories of this assassin/dad and his adventures on the road with his son. The book itself was in excellent condition.
1,Bad Candy,"My son and I ate one each and they were so old and hard they had little to no taste so I set that box aside and was very disappointed. I used to eat these when I was a kid and have always loved them. I have orded some from other places and they were very good but ordeding from amazon was very easy so I tried it, This is the only disappointment I have ever had from amazon. slogo10"
1,OLD,WAS NOT FIT TO EAT HAD TO GO IN THE TRASH WASTED $65.00. WONT EVER DO THIS AGAIN ALL THREE BOXES HAD BEEN OPENED.
4,A good introduction about Pearl Harbor's attack,"I read this book here in Brazil.This book has many photos; all of them black and white photos.About the attack to Pearld Harbor, the book doesn't talks only about the attack itself, but also about its results for both: americans and japaneses.As an introduction, this book is good."
3,Enjoyed it,Good Thai horror film that is well worth watching. If you like international films you will like this one. A good add to your collection.
4,Dance of Desire,This book captured me from the beginning.From the first chapter I was already drawn the main character.I found the plot interesting.It is quite fast-paced story.I recommend this book.
5,"Beautiful Writing, Gripping Story",Catherine Kean writes with heart and passion. I highly recommend all of the books in this series. You won't be disappointed.
2,weak read,"This book offered an honest read but was not totally engaging. The story was not too complex, the romance between the protagonists flowed smoothly but not completely believable. I found the character of Rexana not so pleasant. Too prone to defiance, even when she professes to be in love with Fane. She senses Fane's internal turmoil and doesn't do anything to help him or to gain a closer knowledge of his past. She strikes as a selfish, self-centered personality, focused only on the needing of her brother, totally ignoring Fane's reasoning and his feelings."
2,Did I get a different book than the other reviewers?,"Because the book I have read was not fast-paced, passionate, the essence of romance, or erotic. It was corny, boring, and lacking - so very very lacking. The ""exotic"" and ""erotic"" dance was neither. It was embarrassing to bear witness to, as was all scenes between the two. That being said I did like Fane a bit. But there was no chemistry between the two. Also the writing is veeeeery explicit and we get to know all their thoughts and it is so very very boring to know all the characters are thinking."
1,Stereotypical and Unlikely,I could not suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy this book. I suppose that it serves as escapist fiction but didn't do anything for me.
4,Dance Rexanna...,Ms. Kean is a real storyteller. She knows how to really pull you in. And anyone would wish for such loyalty and belief in another person. And the love between brother and sister was truly heart warming. The hero couldn't have been better and the heroinhad just the right amount of willfulness to go along with her high spirited nature.
4,Entertaining,Enjoyable read. Can be a bit nerve wrecking at the slow pace sometimes but still enjoyable. Overall I liked this book.
4,Interesting,"I was pleasantly surprised reading this that I actually kept trying to figure out if the culprit really did do it or didn't do it. I was surprised to realize that although the book is a good length, it didn't read that way. At least not to me."
4,A great historical romance,"This was a really good book by an author that was new to me. I was surprised by how easy it was to fall in love with this book. I thought the opening scene did the rest of the book justice. I liked the chemistry between the two main characters and liked that the author went off the beaten path a little with her female lead. I tire of bimbo characters in historical romance and this girl had some spunk and fire. I wish that the supporting characters had been a little more developed, but that was my only minor complaint. This author is really good and I will watch for more books from her."
5,MUST HAVE for up and coming readers!,"I don't comment too often, but when I really have an opinion I have to. This book is awesome and I am so glad I found it. My daughter LOVES doing these treasure hunts, and unfortunately (well for the book) her reading ability surpassed the book too quickly because the clues were way too easy for her after a while. I had to start going towards the back of the book to get harder ones. But I DEFINITELY recommend this for kids who are just about to learn to read. My daughter will drop whatever she is doing to go on one of these Treasure Hunts and zig-zag through the house to find the clues. Lots and lots of fun and very very educational."
4,"E-mail @ Work - Informative, well written and to the point!","This book is quite good, if you need to set up guidelines, policies & best practices in any type of business. Whelan gives good advice on information management, security and electronic communication."
3,"Predictable approach, but does not consider historic precedent or composer's intentions at all.","This book sadly turned out to be a predictable approach to playing the piano which favors the 'wet' sound which has predominated for some time, regardless of knowledge of the instruments and aesthetics of the composers' time."
5,great buy!!!!,"My mother-inlaw needed a small easy to use cd player, she loves it. It was just what she needed and more, has great sound to."
2,Bring back the sony cfs-b11!,"A portable radio should be able to run on batteries for an extended length of time. If you are looking for a long-lasting run on batteries, the sony CFD-S01 is not for you! The best? The out-of-production sony CFS-B11!"
2,Basic boombox,"A basic digital tuner, CD player, tape cassette player/recorder boombox. There are no treble/bass controls, just a Mega Bass button that doesn't make much difference. Has a useless Mode button to switch from stereo to mono (why?). Has a headphone jack but no other output ports. Sound quality is not impressive, with or without the Mega Bass.It does have a nice Sleep button with preset shut-off intervals of 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes. It can play CD-R's and CD-RW's but other than that, it's a simple, no-frills, no-thrills boombox."
3,Not What I Expect From Sony,"I am disappointed with the feel, which is very cheap. We paid about fifty dollars for it last January; that was too much then and I notice that now it is up to eighty-odd, which is certainly not good value for the money. The CD function has been fine (which is why three stars), but the cassette player is unreliable and the door sticks shut such that I have to pry it open to remove or insert tapes...and we almost always use it to play CDs, so it's not as though we wore out the door! It functions OK, but I don't like that parts are failing or that I could've gotten an item of similar quality for twenty-five dollars at the drugstore."
3,MP3 play,This product did not play MP3 files for some reason. Tested the same CD on 2 other units...and the CD worked fine.
3,Controls too hard to read,This is a basic boombox with cassette recorder which is what I bought it for. I use it to basically write cassettes to Wav file for putting on CD. I use it for audio only. My real complaint about it and the reason I am giving it a 3 star is the fact that the control are WAY too hard to read. You have to have the manual in front of you all the times. Sony should have painted the controls in contrasting colors instead of making them all battleship grey with raised Icons which are also battleship grey. You can't read them at all when you look at them. You basically have to have the manual in front of you at all times to figure them out. Maybe if you used the machine every day (which I don't) you would get used to them.Also the way you instert the cassette to play is backwards from any other cassette play I have every worked with.The ergonomics on this model are sadly lacking.
2,A Kid's Toy,The sound quality lacks depth and is tinny.FM reception is horrible.This is a kid's toy that not even worthy of being used by an adolescent.I've had transistor radios run on 9V batteries that sounded better.
1,Bad-Sony CFDS01 CD Radio Cassette Recorder - Silver,The CD door is very hard to close and all the buttons are very hard to operate. I would return this if I bought it from a local store.
1,Steer Clear!,"I don't think I could have found a worse portable radio if I tried. Terrible reception, poor sound quality with no controls for bass or treble. ""Mega Bass"" is a joke and is hardly discernable. Impossible to program the presets. Don't waste your time. I have not wasted additional money putting the 6 ""c"" batteries in it, so I don't know how long they would last. This piece of crap sits on my window sill at work totally silent because the static that comes out of it is so annoying."
2,poor radio reception,"I have not had problems playing burned CDs as another reviewer did, but I can confirm that the FM radio reception on this stereo is HORRIBLE -- I live in Madison, WI and several of the lower powered local stations (105.1, 105.5) do not come in at all on this radio.The audio range is also limited -- even with ""MegaBass"" there's virtually no bass.Keeping it anyway mainly because it's the only boombox I've found that's small enough to fit on our bathroom counter."
1,Don't buy this product,"If you are thinking of purchasing this item, don't do it! I bought one recently and the CD player does not work. It gives the message ""no disc."""
2,CD player worked for about 18 months,"What you would expect at the price but not what I expected from sony quality. The first one had the decency to quit before the warranty was up. The replacement, the CD player quit about 18 months,the tape still plays but when it stops it makes such a loud snapping noise you would not use it for sleep or meditation, unless waking suddenly is part of your plan. The sony S-350 I received as a gift worked (CD) only a bit longer (the tape does not a loud sound when it stops). My previous combo player had lasted five years, considering it does light duty, a more impressive performance."
3,"great at all ways, except in one..","it is a great item , but fails in one way.. when i play CD_R or CD_RW recorded with 18 or more songs. it start to fails in the next songs after the 18 one.. and not read the music property.. so it fails in these factor.. im going to return mine today, and try to get something diferent.."
1,No 'boom' in this box!!,"Sony, this is a joke, bought this and returned it, I heard better sound out of a Fisher Price radio. Mega bass? As the previous reveiwer mentioned this button is just for show it makes no difference to the output, the speakers sound like a tin can set up. The RCA boombox is a little cheaper and better, but better if you can get a JVC or Panasonic boombox."
2,Disappointed,"Nice basic system. Disappointed it did not have auto-reverse for the cassette player, which was the main purpose in buying the system."
2,Fuzzy Sound,The second I turned it on I noticed the fuzzy feedback noise coming from the speakers--and it's audible whether it's radio or CD or cassette. Even when nothing is playing that shhhhhh sound comes from the speakers. It's very cheapy looking and feeling. After 2 years the CD player broke. I'm quite leery of Sony now.
4,He feels no PAIN,"An intriguing film about the italian Mob and 2 misguided men, who help a entrapped and defenseless boy. Although, debatable as a gay genre film, the hot protagonist and his comrade will surprise you."
3,All right,Certainly not an upbeat story. At times the violence gets disturbing. Human trafficking is obviously a sad reality and the film does a good job at transmitting the horror of it all.
4,perfect for your point and shoot,"I keep this in my bag with my Olympus Stylus Tough 8010 that I mainly use for scuba diving vacation trips, this is small and compact and perfect for taking pictures of the group after a night dive. the legs are adjustable for adding a little height (such as on top of a table) the bubble integration is helpful as well."
4,"Quite portable, but very flimsy","I bought this minitripod to use with my Canon Digital Rebel XT. It's quite a bit bigger than the flexible legged minitripods (but those wouldn't be able to hold a digital SLR properly), but is still very portable. Unfortunately, the construction is quite flimsy, and it seems hard to get stable pictures on this tripod. On the plus side, it does extend to a pretty good height (i'd say about two feet [60 cm]), it's not too heavy, and as I said, it's small, so you can carry it around with you all the time. This, and the fact that it's very cheap, is why I gave this item four stars."
3,pleasant history,"I enjoyed reading the book. It was light and pleasant history but not great literature. However, it was fun reading it in Santa Fe."
5,The King's Lizard,"Wonderfully written imagery. Could not put the book down. I will search carefully for more books with equal stimulation to continue my new fantasy of living in early New Mexico. Cristie knows what she's writing about. Will there be another book soon? Will there be a sequel? I read this one on the train passing through the same area, hardly looked out the window, because the book describes the local climate so well. A very believable fiction."
3,Bristow worth hearing,"I purchased this CD for the Bristow symphony and found it well performed. The piece is a fine example of mid 19th century concert music- Bristow employs a large orchestra and creates some fine and sonorous colorings.(Notable is a prominent Harp part.) The slow movement is especialy moving and lyrical, and should be heard more often."
5,Worthy Barber and Bristow,"While the second symphony of Samuel Barber is certainly a fitting addition to one's musical library, it is the symphony of George Frederick Bristow, which is the real selling point of this CD. The symphony is beautiful, lyrical, and expansive; it owes an obvious debt to Mendelssohn.Bristow was a talented string player, and he was a memeber of the violin section of the New York Philharmonic as of its inception. His fervent championing of American composers put him on the outs with the orchestra's leadership, and he took leave of the Philharmonic for a year in protest. Ironically, his works are now among those works by American composers, which are sadly and undeservedly neglected. But at least for those who acquire this CD, that neglect can be partially remedied."
1,"QWEER VIEW MIRROR--DUMB STORY LINE POORLY WRITTEN WOULD GIVE IT A "" F""","THIS MAY BE THE WORST STORY ON LESBAINS I HAVE READ EVER. POOR STORY LINES THREW OUT BOOKI WOULD NEVER TELL A FRIEND TO READ THE MORON WRITTEN BOOK-AMAZON TAKE IT OF YOUR PAGEAN SAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE MONEY, T. REED"
3,Interesting not earth shattering,"I read this book years ago, it is a collection of stories about different women who do not have children. It would have been nice if other types of ethnic women besides white were interviewed. I would not buy from this particular seller again, it took quite a long time to receive the book. I called and spoke to whomever worked there and she was not helpful and was borderline nasty."
4,Another enjoyable read from a Vineyard author.,"Although this book had less Martha's Vineyard than Cynthia Riggs first novel starring ""detective"" Victoria Trumbull, I found it more enjoyable. In ""Deadly Nightshade"", there were too many coincidences that placed Victoria Trumbull in just the right place at the right time to be involved in the solution to the murder mystery. In The Cranefly Orchid Murders, Victoria still happens upon the first dead body, but the rest of plot involves her skills and pluckiness in a more natural way. There is more mystery to this book, and some enjoyable exchanges among the varied groups vying for the 200 acres of prime real estate which lead to the murders. There is also a wonderful description of one characters slip into alcoholism and homelessness, and I like that there are a few minor loose ends which are NOT neatly tied up at the end.I look forward to the next Cynthia Riggs novel!"
4,Rod Stewart - The Great American Songbook,"I am not a great Rod Stewart fan, but after hearing some of these songs at my hairdressers, I bought all three albums. I am enjoying these tremendously----I think they are really great!"
3,smaller than expected,I was not impressed with this product as it was smaller than i thought it would be and I have ended up using this just for drawing pictures.
4,Journal,"I lie it, but it was a lot smaller than I figured, I don't remember to write in it as much because of how small it is...but I do like it and am satisfied with my purchase."
4,Decent,"I bought this for my eleven year old daughter for Christmas. She had filled up the goofy one from when she was a kid and I promised to get her a nicer one when she did. I feel I did not live up to that promise. Though she is happy, I do feel that it is worth spending $25 to get a nice diary/journal. This, to me, is not a lot better than a notepad."
4,A decent journal.,"I took a chance with this journal by an online order versus my usual take of in-store purchase. My favorite part is the leather bound, red color heart design. The lined paper is decent, spacious enough to write but would appreciate more room for flexibility. I'm not crazy about it but I would purchase it again or a similar product."
5,Small size holds big ideas!,"The convenience of this journal's size makes it a constant companion for me. There's no need to leave it behind because it won't fit in the purse of the day!It's small enough to be unobtrusive, but big enough for me to record my thoughts and illustrate them with the requisite illustrations.The heart is a just another reason to love it all the more!"
3,Not for large paws,"This product arrived early and in excellent condition. However, I'm a moron and didn't read the size of 5x7. The binding on the book is tight, which is a good thing because it'll withstand numerous times of being opened and closed, and is a bad thing because you can't get all the way into the middle of the book to write. That being said, it's winter in Minnesota, and everything is stiff. Large handed writers might have a tough time using this."
5,Give it to your girlfriend!,"I gave this journal to my girlfriend (who is now my wife ^_^v), and she absolutely loved it. I hope she wrote positive things about me.Very nice quality - seemed better than the products I saw at Barnes and Noble stores."
5,A wonderful gift for your favorite journaler,"I gave this to my boyfriend's mother after our long conversation about journaling, and she absolutely LOVED it. It's a way for your favorite journaler to remember how much they're loved when they put their thoughts down on paper."
5,AWESOME!!,"This CD rocks! Feist has an amazing voice and the singer of Mooli reminds me a little bit of Dusty Springfield, whoever loves electronic music, it's a must have! Nicely blended together for general consumption without seizures upon random play."
1,Cabin Fever?,This looks to be a copy of the cabin fever DVDs. Not much details under the product description.
3,Vaneli Pump,This shoe looks nice on the feet. Only criticism is that the leather is hard and does not give.
2,Illogical to the core,"Here we see three stories tied into one novel, each story more implausible than the other.The whole story is based on a completely not credible idea and that is even admitted in the end. This is due to the TV series wich, by the way, I have watched.The physics are completely flawed, and if I've been given accurate information, this episode was one of the ones that made Gene Roddenberry declare the animated series non-canon, wich I wasn't surprised to learn at all.And although Alan Dean Foster's writing is adequate, it doesn't get near to being good enough to even slightly saving the book. Don't bother to read this."
4,Almost perfect,"Liners are tight fitting socks, so for me, these work really well. They're well padded and work great for running/hiking/every day use. Gold Toe socks tend to last so I doubt I'll have any problems with them lasting a while. My only critique of them would be that as someone else said, they don't fit as high the picture shows but instead, they come up to just below the ankle."
1,Chemical Smell,Your product puts off a persistent chemical odor and are not usable. Can you manufacture whitout the odor or is that controled in China?
3,I like Dudamel. I just don't think this is so extraordinary,"The Mahler performance is good. But will it be so good twenty years from now? Is this really a version that can supplant Kubelik, or, God forbid, Bruno Walter? Frankly, I thought there were moments that were somewhat shallow, where key details were buried beneath the romantic flow. And the sound is stunningly lacking in nuance.As for the L.A. Philharmonic, they sounded infinitely better when Maazel conducted them in Sibelius 2nd in January. On this Mahler DG live recording the strings sound thin. Fault of the recording? I don't know.I'm a subscriber to the L.A. I've been knocked out by Dudamel a few times already. I expect great things. But let's not lose our reason over this.As for the opening piece...the finest moments reminded me what a remarkable film composer Jerry Goldsmith was (especially in his score for ""Chinatown). I just don't know why John Adams thinks he should be the guy to remind us that."
2,Not Much There,"I received this DVD as a gift from a good friend and I look forward to listening/watching it with great expectations.I am disappointed! Mr. Dudamel seems to have learnt all the theatrical elementsand gestures of Leonard Bernstein, but without holding the musical elements in shape or presenting the musical argumentsin a coherent manner. Bits and pieces, they may sound exciting and may at times shock and awe. Unfortunately,the whole is much less than the sum of its parts. If this is what real Mahler would sound like, I would have abandonedMahler years ago. The most shame of it all is that the sound of the orchestra was excellent but the conductorwas not able to mold it into a convincing whole.(One of my favorite versions is Rafael Kubelik's on DGG.) I am afraid thisyoung conductor is not an isolated case on the American classical music scene and this interpretation is typically whatthe public is exposed to or listen to."
4,A pity about City Noir,"I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD because of the inclusion of a very modern work by John Adams so-called City Noir. Although this would be a suitable noise for a background of a horror film perhaps since it contained absolutely no melody or tune I consider that it was most unsuitable for this concert.A work by Leonard Bernstein would have been more appropriate ,The Symphony number one by Mahler was magnificent on the contrary and I enjoyed this enormously. Both the quality of the sound and picture was beyond reproach.Thus I feel rather shortchanged as far as I was concerned.Gustavo has great panache and it is a most exciting conductor"
5,Sorry I mean for all ages,I'm sorry about the for ages 10 thing I would like the edited episodes be for all ages.
1,"Selfish, immoral, reprehensible characters","If I didn't think the human race sucked before watching this show, I would after. There's being flawed and then there's being a character on ""Rescue Me."" There's not one person I would want to spend five minutes with. Everyone is a liar. Everyone is selfish. No one is loyal. No one is kind. No one is happy. If I were a NYC Firefighter I would be angry at the portrayal of firefighters. And what's with the attractive 90-lb. female firefighter? I'm sure she's lovely, but she couldn't lift an overweight man out of a burning building. And what's with all this 9/11 stuff. I'm sure they're haunted by it, but it doesn't excuse having no character. These characters were likely horrible people before the towers fell. EEEEK, I feel dirty and depressed after watching this dreadful show. It's like ""Mystic River."" Everyone is horrible. Are all working class people horrible?"
5,Denis Leary is the Man!,This is one of the grittiest and finniest shows I have had the pleasure of showing. This is how TV should be done. A must see from end to end.
5,Suspenseful and funny,Excellent drama that also makes you laugh...characters are well developed and you get hooked pretty quickly. Would recommend to anyone.
5,love it!,cannot get enough of this show and had to purchase the disc so i can watch more! show is a must see!
5,Funny/Entertaining,"I cannot recommend Rescue Me enough. With the overflow of Reality Shows and new series shows out there, I truly enjoyed this show more than any other one. I was pleasantly surprised to find it absolutely hysterical in addition to it being serious at times as well. The show does not sugar coat anything. It may be too much for some people but the perfectly placed adjectives, adventures (in sexuality) and and jokes make a more personable show. It makes you feel that it is a true depiction of what real firefighters go through. All the actors and actresses deserve high credit. It was expertly done.I am looking forward to buying Season 1 when it comes out and look forward to a new season as well. If you haven't watched it already, you need to start. You wont be disappointed."
5,One of the BEST shows EVER,"I was a fan of other Dennis Leary's stuff (stand up, The Job) so i had high hopes for this show. It exceeded my expectations in every way, it was funnier than i thought it was going to be, more dramatic. Every character is well acted and well rounded and i have never missed an episode. Do yourself a favour and but this as soon as it comes out!!"
1,a disappointment,"it contains nudity and adult scenes,and i also thought i would see like firemen saving other ppl's lives and stuff but it wasnt like that at all, it was about tommy basically dealing with his life wife.. etc! therefore i wont give it more than a star!"
1,Lame Show For In-The-Closet Whiteboys,"I can't sum it up any better than that.This is cheap vular trash. If Howard Stern was going to make up a show it would come pretty close to looking like this.Never seen real men (esp firefighters) worrying about skin creams or sizing up their boys' abs or butt!Never seen a real man hope & pray his daughter become a lesbian (again...shades of Howard Stern)Never seen such a blasphemous portrayal of Jesus Christ brought to the TV by a supposed ""Christian"".Never seen one of the most noble and bravest of professions: Firefighting, made to look like it is being done by the most immature, dysfunctional, bigotted people.A real shame for firefighters. A bigger shame that they feel the need to support this show simply because Leary comes from a firemen family and donates mega bucks to firefighting causes."
1,The worst firefighting show ever made.,"It amazes me that so many people rave uncontrollably about this indescribably mediocre, revolting series.I saw an episode on Sky One, and to me it was just a repulsive grab-bag of rubbih cinematography, writing that simply beggared belief in its stupidity and vulgarity and acting that was all but non-existent.This series pales in comparison to the definitive fire fighting drama, 'London's Burning' which possessed superb characters and astounding action sequences (another area in which 'Rescue Me' is drastically short).The fact that a show like this gets such rave reviews jsut goes to show what trash American viewers are sued to. Just do us Brits a favour, and keep the second series where it belongs."
4,great show,great show--a little misogynistic but likely realistic for the setting of the show; interesting characters
5,BEST TV SHOW IN YEARS,"5 STARS SHOULD SAY IT ALL YOU CAN NOT STOP WATCHING, ACTING WONDERFUL VERY WELL CAST. VERY WELL WRITTEN"
4,"Great show, and I love the theme song!","Started off not really liking this show, I have never liked Dennis Leary in anything. I kept watching and after 3 or 4 episodes I was hooked. The characters are very complex, the writing and directing is excellent. Even Dennis Leary's tendancy to overact is kept in check (for the most part) and I'm actually able to see him as a character. Great show, definitely not ""The Wire"" but find most epoisodes are better than just about any other TV show I can think of."
4,Entertaining and Addicting =),I bought this for one of my guy friends as a gift (he's a fire fighter) so I started watching it with him and now I'm hooked! Very entertaining.
4,He loved it...,I'm not a huge fan of the show but I bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend and he loved it.
5,Excellent deal,I bought this for a birthday gift for my brother. I was very happy with the efficiency of purchase and arrival time. Excellent condition!
3,semi-realistic,"Overall I think that if you are in the firefighting industry or know someone in it, you will really like this show.the quirky station humor is pretty true to life, although their lives seem to be trainwrecks, one bad thing happening after another which is unrealistic but I DO love that they dont try to make firefighting look like something that it isnt, like most shows and movies do.Some people have said that the girl in the show is unrealistic because shes thin, which i find ridiculous because my fiance is a great firefighter, all 5'7"" and 125 lbs of him.Personally, I got this DVD for my fiance and hes been watching it non-stop. He LOVES IT, and ive grown to like it a lot too. I think that people outside of the firefighting life might have a hard time relating to it or understanding some of the ridiculous things that happen. I will be buying season two for him when it comes out."
5,Amazing Show,"Rescue Me is far and away the best show on television right now. While The Shield, Deadwood, and even Nip/Tuck garner more praise, Rescue Me is consistently more captivating, more dramatic, and ultimately more entertaining. Even the shows potentially gimmicky hook, in which the main character Jimmy (Dennis Leary in what is obviously a role very close to his own mold) is ""haunted"" by the ghosts of friends and victims that have perished in front of him, is so well crafted and astutely acted that it is totally beleivable and seemless woven into the more realistic elements of the show. This is one of those shows that oozes beleivability. It is obvious that the show and its characters are important to the writers and the actors. Resuce me does not pull any puches with gore and hero sentimentality, which so often pervade lesser firefighter lore. It feels and looks true, and that is rare these days. I can't recomend it enough."
3,What An Apt Title...,"If Denis and Peter were trying to portray America's newest heroes as normal people with flaws who do a dangerous job, they succeeded--perhaps a little too well. All of the characters have problems, but as the lead character, Tommy Gavin has the most. Watching him careen virtually rudderless through every episode is like rubbernecking at a car accident; you watch out of morbid curiosity, and it is the same morbid curiosity that makes you watch him to see how he further screws up just about everything in his life.It's an incredible amount of consistency, and as the season wore on, it became more and more depressing. As much as I like Denis, I don't think I could handle another season."
1,HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH,This movie was teriiirble. Maey dad thought i was not reding the pages i didnt find the dierctions lego my eggo
3,Good game,"The game is a lot of fun but the instructions stink. It took me forever to figure out how to get past the first screen because the controls didn't work. It shows you Garfield's view but no menu and it shows you how the envelope is slipped under the door and the instructions tell you to open the envelope but you can't maneuver Garfield over to the envelope... it just lets you look around the room. Finally, I figured out that you have to place the stylus directly underneath the envelope and hold it there for several seconds and then the envelope opens. Good grief...couldn't they have told us that?"
5,Celebrates Parents and Children,I love all three of Mae Robertson's CDs. This one is filled with songs about our children that bring tears to my eyes. Each song conveys the hopes and dreams we have for them with so much love.
2,Packed Full of tough to glean info,"It is hard to believe that the Author is a long time professor considering her writing skill. A sample:""As the United States attempts to assist the People's Republic of China in its wish to enter the World Trade Organization as a full-fledged member, the People's Republic of China (PRC) ranks second in the world on the basis of GNP figures. The GNP of the United States is double that of China, which is ranked in second place.""I'm more likely to believe that the author is an underacheiving university student trying to meet a word requirement. This being the only book I know of dealing with this topic, she can get away with it, but if there were something else competing with this book, it would nearly certainly be easier to read."
2,dont see how it helped me,"i work infront a computer for many hours, and my eyes are killing me. i thought that this thing will help but tell you the truth i just see how it suppose to help, because it didnt. that screen comes with a useless cord that makes your thing that you are missing the part which suppose to connect the this cord, it comes with two ""hangers"" to attach the the screen to the pc monitor, but after using it for a while it just didnt helped. this product is a lie they saying that this product helps your eyes, but i dont really know where they take this from"
2,Superficial,If you know nothing about thyroid disorders then this book will be very useful. But if you do know something about it and want to learn more - then this book is a waste of time. It is the same superficial information you can get from the Internet. I'm sure endocrinologists have books they read on this subject - but I bet this isn't the one. There must be a lot of knowledge and science out there on this subject - but it isn't in this book.
5,I'm telling everybody about this,"I picked up this book expecting to laugh and I did. It's funny and outrageous and absolutely true. Buy it give it as gifts to your girlfriends and older daughters. Behind the humor there is a wealth of serious advice for conducting yourself. So don't be mistaken for being a hoochie, listen to Ms. Thang and get yourself together.Kimberley Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should've Told You About Men"
2,"Good idea, poorly edited","This book had lots of potential...four stories about plus-size ladies and their new romances. The stories are cute, light entertainment, with appealing characters but no surprises. I'd have liked a bit more suspense, in all cases the reader knows immediately that the object of our heroine's affections feels the same way. The biggest problem here is the sloppy editing which eventually gets very intrusive. Commas missing everywhere but put in where they don't belong, words misused (in the narrative, not in the character quotes)and overused. A few examples: ""...and a jolt of electricity jettisoned through his body."" ""It was a patient's right to sign themself out of the hospital and there wasn't much he could do..."" ""He hung up the phone, debating for half a minute as to the veracity of calling her at home, but decided to go with his gut."" if the author doesn't know the meaning of ""jettison"" or ""veracity"", surely someone else on the publishing staff ought to?"
3,Big Girls Don't Cry,"interesting reading. Story plots were OK. Stories seemed too short, would have liked more detail in stories."
5,Best lost battalion book yet.,"This is a fantastic book. Very well written with plenty of illustrations and easy to follow. The author definately did his homework. I am a WWI buff and have ready plenty of books, especially on the Lost Battalion. This one is by far the best yet."
3,Wistful Thinking,"...the us is too strong, resourceful, adaptable and deep-pocketed (militarily, and in the case of select segments of well-heeled domestic oligarchs) to go the way todd has suggested...in addition, short of war, the euro-zone is too fragmented to coalesce in the manner todd wishes...there will not be another empire after the american empire...and the picture of heaven that todd has painted will probably have little relation to reality..."
2,"Interesting, but inaccurate","It's interesting reading if you enjoy eccentric writing, but a single statistic can effectively put the lie to Todd's claim of decline for the United States versus Europe:By 2050 per-capita income in the western EU (today's flagship EU economies) will be less than $50,000 (adjusted for projected exchange rates by Goldman Sachs, and this does not even factor in that the bulk of the EU population will be in the poorer eastern EU - this is the best-case scenario for Europe).By 2050, the United States will be approaching half a billion people, with a per-capita income of $84,000. That's nearly 70% higher than the western EU per-capita income.In other words, US per-capita income will actually increase relative to even the most advantaged western European economies. Today US per-capita income is roughly 50% higher than the western European average, whereas in 2050 it will be roughly 70% higher."
1,Poorly argued and at times borderline fantastical,"If this is what the rest of the world thinks of America (and I don't believe it, rather it's the result of a largely liberal/socialist dominated media) I am scared. Incoherent (and sometimes prejudiced) rant about wealthy but unequal american society, Jewish lobbies (yes, I forgot they control congress and the world). some of the assertions about afghanistan and iraq are delusional (we attacked to impress other countries). This book is complete trash. If I had to guess, Todd is longing for the old French empire"
2,wrong assesment,"The American empire is just beggining, not ending. One American order, that of the Nato and U.N, is falling this is true. But the reality is a new American century is replacing it, not to be outdone by the old. This book is simply flawed, little evidence shows a retreat of America from eminance, rather American power is growing in leaps and bounds and this book turns a blind eye.Seth J. Frantzman"
5,Lot of truth that will hurt you!,"Greetings from Germany! Please read this book for understanding what is actually happening! There is no better way for you in the US than this. But it will really hurt you in a lot of ways. It is not about how much Europe has to thank you, it is more about the difficulties now. You will get the view from the other side you do not see in your TV at the moment - so it will hurt!"
1,A Scholar tries Journalism (and get it wrong),"This book, though the author is a respected scholar, seems to be guided by the two golden rules of journalism: 1) Over-simplify; and then, 2) Exaggerate. If you are looking for serious analysis backed by verifiable facts and figures, look elsewhere. If you want a stew of smug opinions and outrageous generalizations, then this is the book for you."
3,hard to read in bed,not finished reading-- author has an agenda to sell. He must have not live in the world I live were you have sell your skills-deliver your skills correctly- and then collect your wages
5,9 years later,"Todd published the French version of this book in 2002. Nine years later most of what he described then has not only been confirmed by facts, but the pace of transformation (public debt, trade deficit, military efficiency, raise of Chinese economy...) was even faster than he expected."
2,Not the best Sibelius suites,"I have no previous acquaintance with Tiilikainen and this Icelandic orchestra. In my opinion, the early 80's recording of Pelleas et Melisande by Karajan and the Berlin is far superior to this one. The gold standard is probably the Beecham-London recording, ancient but inspired."
4,Calphalon Stainless Measuring Spoons,Spoons are excellent quality just like the rest of the Calphalon line. These were bought as a gift and my daughter loves them.
4,"Love these, but...","These measuring spoons are a good shape and have a comfortable grip. However, I was disappointed to find that the tablespoon had bent in the middle when I dipped it into some frozen orange juice concentrate. I would say they have the measurement part down but need to work on the 'spoon' aspect."
3,"Almost perfect, but not quite...","These measuring spoons are well worth the money, as they are very well made. The stainless construction means they'll last for my lifetime, and the silicone grips are very comfortable. But where's the 1/2 tablespoon?Admittedly, I am well aware that half a tablespoon is equal to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons, but is the average person? I don't think so. Getting rid of the 1/4 teaspoon (as the average person had better be able to figure two 1/8 teaspoons equals a 1/4 teaspoon, or they should not be allowed near a kitchen or any open flame) and including the 1/2 tablespoon would have been preferable to make this set perfect.Even still, this set is worth your money. I am now planning to get the matching measuring cups by Calphalon as well just based on these."
2,Tweezers,I myself don't like these tweezers. They don't grip the hair good. You have to keep pulling that same hair over and over again. I bought some $4.00 tweeters from Avon that is way better than these.
4,Good tweezers but not the best,I bought these tweezers for my girlfriend since she was using some low quality dollar store variety. I read quite a bit of reviews on these and i thought for sure theyd be great but both her and i find they dont work as well as my loreal diamond tipped ones i bought for half the price of these. They are great tweezers but not the best ive used.
3,a good pre shave,"this stuff works , but i don't like the way it comes out of the bottle .. too hard to control the flow"
2,Cheap but you get what you pay for!!,"To be honest, I bought these so I could get free shipping. They were a few dollars and I wouldn't pay much more for them, definitely not the full price. They don't have caps on the top so dust (or anything else) can get in if you leave them on bottles. I gave them 2 stars as they do actually work but wouldn't get them again."
3,okay and inexpensive,"I got these pourers to use for oil and they do the job. Decent product, especially at the reasonable price."
2,Painfully Slow,"Some good information contained in this book, but not much. If you want to know who is he second cousin of this count, or the sister of thatDuke, this is the book for you. Very slim on details. I kept waiting for the revelations of hows and whys of the decisions that were made during and after WW2. Instead there was nothing but generalities and references. Here is an example. Do you remember the movie A Bridge Too Far ? Well, this operation was a disaster pushed on the Allies by Churchill and more importantly Monty. Well, the diary entry in the book for the days after the battle, Colville states matter of factly that the ""5th Airborne Brigade has been wiped out"". Thats it! I would expect that private secretary to the PM would have more details on pre and post discussions.Read at your own risk."
2,wanted smoke but got mostly sugar,"From reviews I'd read here and elsewhere, I was under the impression that this artist was less contemporary ""smooth"" jazz and more traditional, old school, smoky and backroom sounding.After listening trough the CD I was left disappointed. With the exception of a really terrific cover of Nick Drake's Riverman, I found these tunes a bit too perky and saccharin for my taste.If smooth jazz is your cup of tea, this will probably satisfy. But if Billie Holiday or Ella Fitzgarald are more to your taste, this will probably leave you - like me - wishing for something with a little more grit."
3,It is good but not excellenet,"I initially tried a 1GB memory from other company and it worked good, but then I returned it and got this 2GB (2 x 1GB) but it didn't make my PC as fast as previous one. I am not in electronics, but it appears that this card is a 8 bit whereas the old one was 16 bit."
3,Malco FCG2 1-1/4 Inch Overlap 5/16-Inch Thickness Fiber Cement Siding Gauge,"The product works reasonably well, but the package contains only one overlap gauge and at least two are required to do the job comfortably. After buying one set and working for one entire day using it, I had to buy another one to make the job much easier the next time. Two overlap gauges would be a much better buy (i.e., leave out the sliding gauge. It was of very limited benefit.)"
4,Works Perfectly!,"Bought this for a Dell Dimension 5150 to pump up my RAM from 1G to 3G. Had it installed in about 5 minutes. Noticed an immediate improvement as soon as it was in. For what I do on my PC, I was happy with just the 1G----or so I thought! Great price and super fast delivery speed. With Crucial you can't go wrong."
5,Plug and play,"Bought this 2 x 1GB set for $36 and plugged into HP A1710n, in addition to the existing 2 x 512MB. Computer recognized added memory during boot. Everything works for far. Observed improvement on a number of applications."
1,crucial memory,I had the worst customer support ever for a large company. I will never order anything from crucial again. I needed to return this item because i no longer needed the item. I snet several emails out to find out how to return the item but never received a reply on how to accomplish this. After 2 months I received an answer stating you can't receive an refund because it had been past 30 days since the purchase. What kind of company operates like this.
2,DVD,I couldn't get this CD to work on my computer. I followed all the instruction and was never able to use it. I gave it to a friend.
4,Wow!!!!,"Even though it is not a totally complete collection of the works of Watchman Nee, this is a total time and money saver. The works that are not included on the CD-ROM can easily be sought out on the net......it is completely worth the 20 or 30 bucks that you will spend...God bless the person/team that decided to put this together."
1,Defective Unit,"I looked forward to the arrival of this coffee maker that I could use in my travel trailer. Unfortunately, the first time I poured water into it to make coffee, the water began to leak out of the unit and all over the stand that it sat upon. If it weren't for that problem, I would have probably have gotten much good use out of it. I returned the item for credit.The only other comment I'd like to make is that I thought the unit was bigger than it actually is. You might get 2 or 3 cups of coffee out of each brew cycle."
1,Wast of Money,"This was one of the most disappointing items we have purchased. Expecting to make a convenient cup of coffee from the pickup or boat. &quot;Brews a pot of coffee in minutes&quot;, yeah 30 of them, and even then the coffee is only warm. Advise never purchasing this item if you are looking for a great camp item. 1 star is giving this item the benefit of the doubt. We also have the 12 volt blender(unused so far) and my expectations of that item are low, very low."
1,Peice of junk,"It took about 30 min. to produce less than 1 full cup of coffee, and then it just continued to blow my trucks fuse for the cigarette lighter. I was very disappointed and I would suggest that if anyone is considering buying this to save their money!"
1,takes for ever,"it seems to take for ever to make coffee I waited 30 min and it had only made one cup of coffee, maybe i need to jurry rig mor power to it?"
1,Not worth it!,"We were excited about the prospect of having freshly brewed coffee on our camping trips. Decided to try out the unit before putting into fulltime service, glad we did! Took about twenty minutes to drip all the water in the carafe, the capacity of the coffee maker. The drip was very slow. Perhaps it relates to the fact the coffee maker runs off 12Volts. In any case, we decided not to risk being stuck with an appliance that doesn't get the job done and returned it to our target store."
4,Sheryl Rocks On!,This album has 3 songs and an Interactive part songs 2 and 3 are kind of repetative because they are from Sheryl Crow and Friends in Central Park (which I don't think is that bad). To get the overall expierence downloading quicktime from the CD is a must and listening on the computer is the way to go. There are numerous pictures that come with it as you listen to Soak up the Sun. I gave it four as opposed to 5 stars because it is more of an interactive disk. But all the songs are great if you like Sheryl Crow!
5,Texas Ranger Jack Hays,"A must read for anyone interested in the legendary Texas Rangers. It provides a good historical account of Col Jack Hays's exploits beginning from his childhood to his involvement in the Mexican-American war and then briefly, the later years of his life. Anyone interested in leadership will want to read this as well. Col Jack Hays was a pioneer and leader worthy of emulating. I found it hard to put down."
5,Very good book.,Very well written - keeps your interest level high. I liked it because I live in the area and recognize all the towns and areas mentioned in the book. I had a Great-Great Grandfather that was a Texas Ranger and wanted to know more about they're lives -was just sorry I didn't find my family's name mentioned.
1,Texas ranger Jack jays in the frontier southwest,Ho hum not enough meat and potatoes. To much about troop movements. Not enough descriptive battles. Devoid of all blood and guts. Did not hold my interest.
3,I too was tricked by the photo,"I, like Daniel, purchased this book thinking it was the 1975 edition. My fault for not making sure I guess. Turns out it was the 1985 edition....UGLY COVER - Part of this book's appeal was the fact that it was both functional AND visually appealing.... I'll end up tracking down the one I originally wanted (I'm sure it's more than $0.01 + shipping) and donating this one to the thrift shop down the road.Three stars because it's still a useful book, even though it's ugly. Buyer beware, check with the seller that it's the edition you are looking for!"
3,Clergy,It's always helpful to have a handy guide to make minor repairs to household items; not to mention saving money for what could have been costly repair. Thank you for making this book available!
5,The Classic Home-Repair Manual,"How things work in your home and how to fix them. 368 pages of very useful information. You will find all the usual home appliciances, plumbing, electric service, toilets, heating systems and cooling systems. The book is easy to read and has excellent diagrams showing the workings of almost everything in the home that is a functioning part of the home."
1,Split Season Nonsense Continues,"Terence Allen hit a ""bullseye"" with his review again, and I'll add...In my opinion the Gunsmoke series is a classic five stars and needs no review as such. The longest running dramatic series in television history speaks for itself.My continuing reviews reflect the release schedule fiasco and the accompanying pricing for the half seasons. Simple math...half seasons should be half priced. Paramount/CBS will continue the split season nonsense as long as there are buyers who ""buy in."" I stopped patronizing after season 1.I recall a reviewer indicating Paramount/CBS botched Season 2 Volume 1 because they pulled episodes from another season and placed them on this volume...and people are paying for the mess.Paramount/CBS did Season 1 right, and now they're deciding (with this series and some others) to reinvent the wheel. If it isn't broken, don't break it ;-)Simple formula...Complete seasons at competitive pricing."
5,Great Viewing for the Whole Family,"You don't have to be a fan of westerns to enjoy Gunsmoke. The show was, after all, wonderfully-written stories about people you could easily care about. Matt, Kitty, Doc and Chester came to be like family, and you wanted to invite them into your home each week. And I'm thinking there are probably lots of fans like me who grew up with only the color episodes. I'd heard about Chester and Quint, but I only knew Festus and Newly. These early episodes are a real treat. By Season 3, the cast had fully gelled and fleshed out their characters and relationships to one another. So, provided you don't always demand a happy ending (John Meston's writing was definitely not fairy tale), you won't be disappointed if you buy this wonderful boxed set. Thanks to the previous reviewer who listed all of the contained episodes - that helped me to add this one to my pretty extensive Gunsmoke collection. I'm off to buy Season 3, Volume 1 right now!"
5,Matt Dillion,"I grew up watching Gunsmoke and I just love it, I watch every evening and has spent numerous hours watching the videos, when I found the dvd on amazon I was excited, I plan on purchasing more dvd's. Matt Dillon is a Marshall that you can relate to and love he was a people person."
3,Great series but has music been changed?,"I recently recieved a pre-release copy of Gunsmoke, Season 3, Vol.2. I will not comment on the split season but rather that according to a disclamer on the box ""Music has been changed on some of the episodes"". Now since I did not see this series back in 1958 I really have no idea how much music has been changed. I think its terrible how this keeps happening on TV show DVD's released by CBS/Paramount. I can accept the split season releases but can't this show be released with all its original music?"
1,Don't waste your money.,"We bought seven of these and none worked, neither the thermometer or the humidity gauge."
3,Did not work for me...,"I have multiple feet issues and use custom orthotics. I decided to buy this, because it claimed to correct pronation. I was hoping that this product will work with existing orthotics (which solved other feet issues I had) to also address pronation. Also the material is soft and does not have arch support. After using this product I realized how important arch support and firm base is to reduce daily pain...For me arch support and firm base (under a soft upper layer) would have worked better.If pronation is the only issue with your feet, this product may work for you."
1,Uh.....No,"These did absolutely nothing to help with my over pronation. The gel is too squishy so instead of keeping my foot from rolling inward, they just squash flat. Maybe if these were longer and more rigid (that's what she said) and offered support from heel to arch they'd work better. Hopefully someone will make an insert that forces the whole foot into alignment, not just the heel."
1,Too Expensive and Excessive shipping cost,The price is too expensive and FootSmart charges excessively for shipping. Not worth it.
4,good but easy to move,"when i wear it, it's too easy to move around, but still good.it feels comfortable, and maybe actually can help me to relax my feet"
4,balanced foot restored,The heel cups worked for my supination. Outer edge of right foot no longer aching and building callus. Extra benefit of lower back power discomfort gone. Fits easily into my shoes and as long as positioned tightly against rear of shoe don't feel. Easy to move from one pair of shoes to another.
1,No arch support - non possible.,"These raise the heel about 1/2"" (I use them in the pronation position), and as a result there is no ability of the foot to take advantage of an existing, or supplemental arch support. Adding one jacks the foot into a completely unnatural position. I'm better off without it.So, in fact, they are worse than using nothing. I have a requirement to use shoes that put no pressure at all on the Achilles tendon (think barefoot runner) and need to supply all of the support my foot gets through orthotics. I've been using a cheap-o Dr. Scholls from Walmart and I suppose that is what I'll continue to use.These go back. Should have known better, but pain can force you to overlook warning signs..."
2,If only they didn't think I had two right feet.,"I'm sure these are really nice, but I gave up on foot smart when they sent me two right feet rather then pair, and then insisted I pay to ship them back.You're better off ordering from footsmart directly, rather then through amazon, since they both were claiming the other should deal with shipping and returns."
1,Impossible to integrate,The product hasn't been updated for new OS versions and is almost impossible to make it work. Amazon should not sell products like this. Please make sure products are able to run in Windows 7 or even XP
2,Very limited use :-(,"It is only able to stream from a hard drive on local computer, not from web. 1st generation attempt that was discontinued. Zero product support!"
1,poorly functioning machine,"I have had this unit for about 7 months now and it has not functioned right the whole time. I got it from WOOT and everything I have gotten there has not worked right. Maybe that's it. The Omnifi company just sends me back to WOOT and seems to have no interest in this dud of a machine. It likes to just stop at times, has to be rebooted often to function at all.I'd can't use it much. Like the concept tho."
1,Doesn't do much...,"What this product will do: stream anything from your computer.What this product will not do: play anything from the web.This little guy will only play files from your computer. But, all you need to play files from your computer is a five dollar cable which connects your headphone jack to the stereo. Also, this thing is very hard to use. In order to find an album on Rhapsody you have to stream through 70,000 albums, which is exhausting, I'm going back to the simple cable."
5,Truly Inspirational Cross-Stitch,"This is a must have book. I first saw the book at the public library, and realized that there was no way that this pattern book would be one that I would be content just to borrow for two weeks - I had to find a copy that I could keep! The quality of the patterns is wonderful. The patterns are full color, and large so that they are easy to use. Unlike many patterns books that only have one or two patterns that I like well enough to do, each of the projects in this book are so beautiful that it was hard to decide which one to do first. The low price here certainly makes this a book that you won't want to pass up."
4,Nice beautiful book!,"It was what I wanted and the book was in better shape than I thought it was going to be. The book came early, which is always a great joy. I saw on Amazon and ordered it through them and they took over the order."
2,"I can't tell if my fish likes it or not, but they seem not to eat it.","I've tried many oscar food but this one seems to make my fish less active.Makes a big mess in the tank and when the fish chew, the pellets break apart and a lot of cleaning."
3,Messy Fish Food!!,"My Oscar likes these, but this stuff really messes up the tank. I feed him 1-2 at a time so there isnt non floating around, but they still end up all over when he chews them up and the tank gets trashed fast... I know we have the smaller sticks that are brown colored and they do not make the same mess as these big red sticks do...I am not sure if i will buy these again. But my fish dose eat them... so i would give them a 5.5 out of 10.. i wish they where like the brown colored ones, because the size of these sticks are great..!!"
1,Fish wouldnt touch it,I have a 45 gallon tank with 7 cichlids for varying colors in it. I bought this from a local store because it appears to be made specifically for my fish. My fish never ate a single piece of this food. I feed my fish once in the morning and once at night. The food always floated at the top of the tank and would eventually break down turning the water reddish though the food promises to be a clear water formula. I ended up throwing the entire container away. I wouldn't use it again.
1,tetra jumbomin sticks,"Was disappointed. I did not receive jumbo sticks, received regular size and that is not really good for my fish since he is huge"
1,Not worth the time to watch it nor the money to buy it,This product was not worth the money that I paid for it. I wish I hadn't missed the window for returning it for a full refund.Others might find it useful and worthy of praise. I didn't.C'est la vie.Lee
1,They falsely advertised the product (BUYER BEWARE),"I ordered this for my 2006 mazda 3 hatchback. They said it would fit it. It did not fit it at all, it was designed for the 2006 4 door not the hatchback (two different models). Because of this whole ordeal, I had to return and lost $9.00 because of ship.BUYER BEWARE, make sure it fits your car 100% do not trust their ""Will it fit your vehicle?"" because it is wrong!"
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book as inspiration for my jewelry because I like to work symbols into my pieces. It has a beautiful selection of symbols though I would like more text description for them. I also had issues with the separation between the symbols and their respective text. This book is set up such that the text is in a list across a couple pages and then there are several pages of symbols that follows. I would have liked the text to be with the corresponding images so that I don't have to continually flip back and forth to see the meaning of each symbol. You cannot read this like a book, it's more of an image inventory."
5,Very Interesting,"I am primarily interested in Christian symbolism and this book has quite a few, though not meant as an exhaustive resource on any particular set of symbols. I enjoyed the broad range of symbols this book presents - Mayan, Egyptian, metaphysical, Asian, and even some hobo symbols (plus lots more). This book is truly a good general reference for symbol meanings. It is a bit sparse on the origins of the symbols, but certainly supplies enough information to get my interest piqued in different symbols!"
1,Too much irrelevant information,"This book consists solely of series of examinations regarding business law which, unfortunately for me, had little or no relevance to the actual questions on the CLEP exam. It lacks a topical index, explanations, summary or other helps that one would expect from a CLEP prep book. Save your money for something by another author (I'm still looking)."
1,not as advertised,I was looking for a lens with a much thinner rim as it was for a landscape lens and thought it was to wide and compromised my view.
4,good filter but with a smudge on it,"I would have given it a 5 star if it is clean, but it came with a smudge. I tried to clean it off with a microfiber cloth, but some still remains. It was not bad enough to go through the trouble to return it."
4,It's fine,"No issues with this filter. I did a bunch of test shots to compare with and without this filter, using the exact same settings (viewed in LR all images in raw), and the images appear just a slight bit darker, doesn't modify the image really, but I'm not using pro gear (D5100, 18-200mm VRII), so.... I mostly purchased it as a protective coating for my lens, but I think I will only use it when I'm at the beach or other harsh conditions, or if I need 1/16th of a stop down ;-) . Overall it seems to be of good quality, and no problems keeping it clean."
4,Hoya 52mm DMC PRO1 Digital Multi-Coated UV (Ultra Violet) Filter,The Hoya 52mm DMC PRO1 Digital Multi-Coated UV (Ultra Violet) Filter is a very good UV filter which I keep almost always on my 52mm thread lenses to avoid UV haze and as protection to the front element.
5,The standard to measure other filters against...,"After going cheap and purchasing (and returning) aZeikos ZE-UV52 52mm Multi-Coated UV Filter, I decided to go to the other end of scale and purchase this filter. The difference is like night and day.I don't have access to an optical bench to make any real measurements, but it's obvious from just looking that the multi-coating on this filter works well. Reflections are significantly reduced and the filter is water clear. The edge of the glass is coated black to eliminate any internal reflection from the edge.Physically, the black aluminum is knurled on the side to make the filter easy to remove from a lens...stuck filters with smooth sides can be a real pain.The Hoya PRO1 filters are a bit pricey, but worth every penny. They're exactly what a filter should be. Highly recommended."
5,Supplements A MUST,I have always taken nutritional supplements and thought I had a fairly good idea of the quality of the products I was taking. I took it pretty hard when I read the score of the product that I was taking at the end of the book. It got me so curious as to what else I was lacking in my diet and supplementation that I read the whole book. Very great read and definatly worth every penny if you are concerned about how to stay ahead of the health game. Also great laymen information on the aging process and theories of it all.
5,Comparative Guide to Nutritional Supplements,"This book is great! It explains: free radicals, antioxidants, oxidative stress, how to choose a supplement and gives you their ratings! Highly recommend it!"
3,Comparative Guide to Nutritional Supplements,"Excellent explanations of body processes and vitamin involvement. However, the rating system for companies that produce vitamins and their products wasn't very helpful. I was unable to find these products in supplement stores and am reluctant to purchase online because returns are more complicated."
4,Comparative Guide to Nutritional Supplements,"Reading material was somewhat difficult, but got an overall understanding of material. Gives top 5 companies with phone numbers and addresses. Detailed information on newer supplements on the horizon for wellness."
1,This is second time to be cheated by image of books,The image of book is 3rd edition Comparative Guide to Nutritional Supplements but I received 4th edition. They always said they will let Amazon to change the image of book into 4th edition. This situation was happened twice. It really wastes my energy and time to deal this problem back and forth.
3,Can It be Trusted?,"If you look at the 05-06 USANA catalog the author of this book is clearly listed as a member of the Medical Advisory Board. I by just recieved this book for my birthday and look forward to reading it. But I will take the product ratings with less than a grain of salt because I suspect bias and many of the supplements I use-""big name supplements""-never appear in the book."
1,Slanted?,"I have been taking USANA vitamins, but, in part due to this book, I am looking for another product. I think the book may be a marketing ploy to pump up the product. Not sure. But if anyone can recommend a non-mlm vitamin I would be grateful."
5,Comparative Guide,This book is an excellent resource for nutritional supplements on the market today. It informs you of what you really are or are not getting in these products. A must as a resource for nutritionally concerned individuals
1,"Deceptive title and description, buyer beware!","This video was not at all what I expected based on the cover, the description, and the title. You'd think there would be at least some content related to actual cutting? Not so. This is only a very cursory description of a certain style of Iaido (sword drawing). Does not at all delve into actual cutting techniques nor is any even demonstrated in the video. Interesting since the cover photo shows him performing tameshigiri. If you are already a student of Iaido there really isn't anything to be gained from this video even if you are a beginner."
2,Thank goodness for the 'Free' royalty cheques...,"Wow! You think... TWO Andy Fraser albums for the price of one... What's the catch?... Unfortunately of the 19 tracks only 4 of them are half way decent... a fact not lost on the record company evidently...Let me say I'm a huge fan of Andy's... he has an incredible musical gift but it is being squandered. To be perfectly honest he's simply not a solo artist, he works better as part of a democratic unit. The tracks I liked were 'Changed man', 'I wanna be there' (although the bass is a bit too loud in the mix), 'Keep on loving you' and 'Be good to yourself'.P.S The digital remix is appalling - where's the drum sound? If you're going to have a three piece, then all instruments NEED to be in balance and able to be heard. A lot of musical detail is also lost in the mix. Get your act together guys."
5,Got what I asked for.,Good hydrogen peroxide. Got exactly what I wanted. Make sure to dilute with distilled water. Distilled water doesn't have any minerals to interfere.
5,good stuff,"I purchased this product to put in a clense for my husband who is a diabetic. It has worked very well. If you take it put it with flavored water to cover the taste, otherwise it is an easy effective cleanse. Thankyou for making it available, Yulanda"
3,NOT Food Grade!,"Do your research! Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide is 35%, not 12. This might be an excellent product, but it is not what qualifies as ""food grade""."
4,"4 stars only because it arrived dirty (?) - but cute, and snuggly","I have always loved Gunds - they're the softest, snuggliest of the stuffed animals to me. I purchased this as a gift, remove him from the box, and wrapped him in a new box. When he was unwrapped, at first we thought he had spots on him (unexpected) and then noticed he was dirty (grease? something that did not brush off).I offered to return him, but due to his cute, snuggly-ness she wanted to keep him (speaks highly of the bear). However, I will now fully inspect purchases before wrapping them as gifts."
2,The quality has changed!!,"Bought Gund 16 - Manni Bear in November 2009 for my Grandaughter, and I was very pleased with the quality -Now, I bought another one for my other Grandaughter and I was very disappointednot only with the color of the bear - a yellow tan, compared to the beige in 2009, but the cheaper quality of the fabric, also, nowhere in the description, did you mention that the hands and feet had beans as a filler. What happened?"
4,Can't go wrong,"You can't go wrong with Gund. I bought this for my little nephew, but I really wanted it for me."
4,"good band + good album - the good song = ""The Dead And Dreaming""","Today I was in FYE just looking for some stuff to add to my collection and I came across DKL. I had remembered the advance release that I had gotten. I didnt know the name of the tracks at the time that I bought the album, so I bought it anyway, came home and put it in the stereo. I listened to the last track because the last track from the advance release of this album (track no. 11 called ""hindsight"") was probably the best track on the album. track 11 on the retail release of this album ""No Reason"" was different. I was a mad about that, but not to change my view because the rest of the album is still good but ""hindsight"" made this album. I recommend anyone to check that song out if you can find it."
5,DKL Kick It Up A Notch W/ T.D.&D.,"I've followed this band since the birth of ""Hinge"" and I can tell you they've come a long way. With the addition of Jason Bozzi and Dan Horboychuk, DKL has a more unique sound that were missing in their earlier years. I loved T.D.S.O.N. and I love T.D.&D. I hope to hear DKL on the radio, but what radio station has the balls to play them. True, you have to give it a couple of listens but what albums do you like the 1ST time around. Plus, you gotta love torturing your neighbors, co-workers and relatives that listen to that crappy music the radio stations shove down your throat. Crank it up and (...). On second thought go to friends house and break (...0. Have them buy this album."
4,"More mature than debut, but lacking the obvious hooks","I'm a big fan of DKL. They keep getting better with each record. This release is a step away from some of the goofiness of the debut and I think it accomplishes the desired result of people taking them seriously. The songwriting is much tighter, and it is a much more straightforward metal record. Very good album, but it needs to grow on you after a few listens."
4,Decent effort,"For the record I'm not really a Dry Kill Logic fan per say. I own their first two records and I've heard all of the new one. I'd have to say The Dead and Dreaming is their ""crowning"" effort. Now first off, nothing about this band is really original. There were already so many metal bands out there playing these same old riffs for over ten years so by the time DKL came around it was already old. However, the crushing energy and agression cannot be ignored. The mellower parts are very boring and when he sings it sounds like Linkin Park-esque vocals. Nothing special there. So anyway, if you like your metal loud and angry, but low on the technical and originality scale then Dry Kill Logic is for you. This is their heaviest album and packs a punch. Better than Limp Bizkit, Korn, Hatebreed and all that mess, but I'll still stick to my Slayer, Opeth, and Testament albums."
4,Great CD!,I didn't really care for the last DKL CD due to the fact of strange lyrics and rediculous repetition. This CD is much harder that their earlier work(almost like tragic accident has happend to one of the band members since the last CD) and also has better lyrics. This is just an overall really good CD. Highly recommended for metal/hardcore fans.
4,Good Stuff,"You can tell they spent a good deal of time and energy on this album, the new members add a distinctive sound that was missing in TDSON and sets them apart from other acts in the same genre. Only thing missing from this album is the song ""HindSight"" which was not released with the US version. Rocking album none the less!"
4,Less pain in learning to write,"The Writing Stands course has been less painful for me than my son. The first few lessons were on following directions. This proved much more difficult for him than the actual writing assignments. The lessons placed the responsibility for their accurate completion on his squarely on his shoulders. Once those lessons were complete, things settled down to a relatively easy way to teach creative writing to my son."
2,not what i hoped for,"This book has a few good writing helps and techniques, but overall did not come close to meeting my expectations.I planned on using it for home schooling, but there are only a few exercises I will use from it."
4,Good Series...,"I used this book with my son last year in third grade. I liked the way the writing assignments were broken into manageable chunks. This helped my son to visualize how long a writing assignment might take. It makes the whole ""write a story about..."" assignment much less overwhelming. My only complaint is that the book is heavy (in my opinion) on writing stories, which is not the type of writing that my son enjoys doing, though he did turn out some pretty good yarns."
2,Not a Good Book,"I bought this book thinking it will show my daughter about colors. I do prefer hardcover over paperback. The quality of the pull tabs get stuck and my 2 year old daughter has trouble putting them back in. There is no color learning in this book. For a beter book, I recomend Dora's Book of Words / Libro de Palabras de Dora : A Bilingual Pull-Tab Adventure! This book is a better learning book and better contructed Than Dora's Rainbow Surprise."
4,LOVE LOVE HOBO!,"This is my second Hobo wallet/clutch purchase and I am very pleased. Holds up well and fits everything I need in a organized and light manner. I would purchase one in every color if I had the disposable income =) The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because the leather on the specific one I purchased via Amazon had many visible imperfections, but that is leather for you. I highly recommend this product overall though."
4,It's Great!,"I've had this clutch/wallet for going on 6 years now. Perhaps they've changed the leather recently, and maybe it's not as durable, but I've never had issues with the leather flaking or being hard to clean. It has held up remarkably well, and I've got it stuffed to the gills. It works well as a clutch, but I made the mistake of putting my phone in it a couple of times in the outer snap pockets, and caused the leather to completely separate from the metal. So, note to anyone - don't put your phone in it! Otherwise, its great if you have a lot of stuff.."
4,I love my hobo!,"I love everything about my hobo wallet - the color, style, ease of use. I especially love all of the compartments and the strong magnet in the middle."
2,Hobo wallet,"I was really looking forward to this wallet. I ordered the black patent leather belinda hobo wallet. I was very disappointed when it arrived. There was a small area on the fabric for one of the pockets that was damaged. It looked like there was a stain that was treated, the fabric was worn and discolored from the rest. When spending that much money on an item you want it to be brand new. I was able to return it with out any problems for the full refund but I'm hesitant to reorder."
4,Great Wallet/Clutch,"This leather wallet looks great. A very sleek and clean style. It has pleanty of room for credit cards, id, and cash. The larger pockets are capable of carrying cell phone, makeup and other small items. This is a bag meant to carry only the basics."
4,Worth it,For a long time I have been wanting to buy a wallet that can accommodate a smart phone also. I finally found one (thanks to the genuine reviews that I relied on)I got the Mocha color and I am already loving it. It is very spacious with various pockets.I definitely recommend it!
2,Upset,I was so excited when I ordered this item! I couldn't wake to get it in! Then other day I simply opened it to put a check in it and the clasp on the top broke! It will not clasp back together! I was wondering what I can do about this since I just purchased it?Please email me at katelynsever@gmail.com
5,Amazing Wallet,"I was given this wallet as a birthday gift from a friend and thought it was the most amazing wallet I have ever had. It has room for everything, cash, cards, reciepts without seeming bulky. I loved it so much that I gifted it to both my Mother and Sister and they love it too. This makes a great bday present or even just a Thank You. Put it in your purse or just grab it and go like a clutch."
2,arrived scratched,The purse arrived scratched. It was very disappointing since it was to be a Christmas gift for my girlfriend....nothing like ordering a gift that you can not give. :(I have since returned it and am awaiting a credit to my account.
2,Clasp Broke After 2 Months,"I love the color and design of this wallet; however, I bought mine just two months ago. And one of the clasps has already broken. I am so upset and hope that I can get a replacement through Amazon LLC (who was listed as the seller). There is no reason for a $110 wallet to break after just two months of use!Very disappointed"
5,Excellent,Product was exactly what I was looking for! It was packaged well for delivery and arrived very quickly. This was one of my more positive buying experiences and would recommend both the product and the seller. The color of the wallet is even more beautiful than the pictures suggest.
5,Perfect for just about any occasion,"Got the black one to match more outfits. I love the different compartments, especially the middle ID/CC holder. Can hold quite a bit of stuff; including both a smart phone and a digital camera. Does get a tiny bit bulky but otherwise it's perfect! Love the classy but fun look. Would love to get it in another color, or two!"
5,LOVE,"This wallet is amazing! It fits everything (and more), and doesn't have to be too heavy. It can be used as a wallet or a clutch, and very well made. I highly recommend this product."
2,Not satisfied,"I had to return the first of these I received because one of the inner pockets was not attached properly. Though it was promptly replaced, the second wallet has begun to tear in the same place after about a month's use."
2,Disappointed in quality,"I love the shape and function of the HOBO Lauren wallet, but within a week the finish on the hardware began to peel off. If I could figure out how to send this back, and to whom, I would."
3,Somewhat bulky,It is rather heavy and scratches easily. I would not have chosen it again. I am always opening the wrong side for cash.
5,Great clutch,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. It's beautiful, well made, and very practical."
1,Still not shipped,I put in an order to this company that was received on the 21st of August as a birthday gift to a friend of mine. It is now late on the 24th ( a saturday) and the company has not gotten around to prepare this item to ship yet! No excuse in this economy to have slow customer service.
3,Great but not true...,This is a great wallet but the inside fabric is NOT what is show in the picture. It's a red looking fabric. Was every disappointing. But other then that it was great!!!
5,Hobo wallet,I am Very happy with this wallet. It is versitile and great for travel. I would recommend it to others
2,"Nice fit, poor quality","When this swim shirt first arrived I was very happy with the fit. But I have been using it for several months and the fabric is completely unraveling. It's as if some kind of coating on the shirt is peeling off -- entire sections of the shirt have this yucky white stuff peeling off, and the space where the peeling has occurred is much thinner, stretched out of shape, and almost see-through. It looks so bad now that I simply have to throw it away and buy another swim shirt -- after less than one season of use. I have been using it in pools and the beach. I wash it gently and always line-dry, so I don't think the problem is my care. I regret buying this shirt and definitely do not recommend it."
4,Strong Resource Material,Excellent material here. Should be a part of any media pro's resource library.
1,These other reviews must be paid endorsements,"I bought this book based in part on the rave reviews. I did not see much value in the book -- It reads like a couple of friends got together and said, ""hey, since we're good at this, we should write a book about it!"" But the text is scattered, and the instructions are not at all useful. When an example is given to illustrate a point, it's hard to see the relevance of the example, or how it relates to something you might do yourself. There's an old adage, ""Those who can't, teach."" The reverse is true here: ""Those who can, should stick with what they do best, and not try to teach unless they know how to teach."""
5,Fantastic new edition,"I'll keep this short. If you are already a fan of Ars Magica this is an amazing update. Combat is simplified for large groups, but there is still plenty of detail. The magic system remains the best in the RPG world, and is improved upon with better guidelines for creating new spells. Finally, the Virtues and Flaws section is presented with a handy table at the begining that makes it easy to find the ones you are looking for.Great update for a great game."
3,New Design,"This Design won't please you at all. Indeed I have the feeling that I am presented with a low budget copy made by an Inkjet Printer. The pictures aren't in a consistent style, medieval art is shown together with some very unprofessional draft.The quality of the printing is low. You won't boast with this book at you next gaming session.As for the content... as stated on atlas games homepage, some things have been simplified, and combat has become more deadly. The only way to decide if it fits your playstyle is to read it. Sorry that I won't discuss the changes in detail, my review should help those people that also want to have a well designed RPG manual - which this isn't."
2,Pretty darn dull,"This book was more about cashing in on the Internet hype than providing any real business advice. I'm not sure than any of the 23 sites reviewed qualifies as ""incredibly successful."" While these might be interesting anecdotes to some, it provides little else of value."
3,A shoddy book with good data,"This book has indeed a wealth of interesting facts and observations from real-life e-businesses. But it provides little analysis, and it is shoddily produced, abysmally written, and not edited at all."
1,very entry level,"I don't mean to be offensive to the writers, but for me this book was a waste of money. If you are looking to see how people got started on the web two years ago, and you are totally new to e-commerce, then it may have some value for you. Particularly if you are and plan to stay a small business. If your desire is to create a business $5M or more in annual sales online, then I recommend looking at some other titles. I gave my copy to our local Human Needs Center."
1,Poorly accumulated and organized examples of success.,"From the phony copyright date (1999?) to the rotten photos, I think this is a fine way for the author to clear out her unused newspaper article scribbles and rip-off those yearning for a book on this topic. But don't buy this one. It's outdated and poorly organized resulting in a scattered display of interesting examples but not an authentic testimony on Web success. AND DON'T SELL ME A BOOK IN OCT. 1998 (ON A RAPIDLY EVOLVING TOPIC) AND HAVE IT'S COPYRIGHT DATE SHOW 1999!!! ... a phony way to make the book appear current thru next year. Stay away from this one."
2,An Historical Perspective of Web Businesses,"In the hey-day of the Internet Gold Rush, among the dreamers and schemers, there were some companies actually making money on the web - and they weren't all p-o-r-n sites.It's outdated in 2006, as the market has matured and evolved.This book showcases successful sites from 'back in the day,' and how they made money. It would be interesting to research how many are still in business, how many were sold to bigger players, and how many evolved into what they are today under the same ownership."
5,#1 of the Best Books I found for Starting an Online Business,"This was one of the first books I read on starting an onlinebusiness. Read it with a highlighter in hand, and re-read the manytips offered. I have contacted several of these companies forexpansions on their tips and I always hear back with helpfulinformation. This is how we help each other,by sharing. Whyre-invent the wheel. I refer back Easton's site often for updates onthe sites and for more tips. Can't wait for the updated version.This was the single most inspiring book for me to start my own .com!"
2,Only for People want to start an Internet Business at Home,"I simply don't understand why the author say those sites mentioned in the book are successful at all - even for those who want to start a small internet business at home with at most 3 staffs, those sites are not that good at all. For manager of medium-sized to big companies who want to learn more about how to run a successful e-business, go for Customers.com. I am in Hong Kong and am willing to sell the book for US$5-6 (excl. postage)."
2,Interesting but outdated,"Unless you have no idea why a web page may be a productive and profitable idea there's not a great deal of usable information in this book. The 23 examples were repetitive and, although mildly motivating, were about ""first movers"" who established their niches in wide open fields. For someone trying to start up a webpage today, there will likely be little in this book that the readers feel they can relate to. I'm sure it would've been a good book 18 months ago or 20 years in internet time."
1,"Don't waste your time...go buy ""Customers.com"" instead","Poorly written, not well organized (alphabetically by Web site URL???), and not all that informative, unless you're interested in learning about a bunch of quirky Web sites. There were no summaries of ""Lessons Learned"" or ""Best Practices"", so it was hard to follow what the important lessons were in the success of these sites. (And I have to question the author's definition of ""success"", as many of these sites apppeared to have only limited audiences with not all that much potential for future profitability.)If the reader really wants to learn something about ""best in class"" use of the Web for business, go buy Patricia Seybold's ""Customers.com"", a much clearer and better written treatise on eCommerce."
3,"Interesting, but could've been better","I found the case studies to be interesting and somewhat useful. If the author offered an analysis of do's and don'ts at the end of each case, this would've been a much better book."
4,A wonderful blueprint for success,"Strikingitrich.com is an excellent source of ""what worked"" on the Internet. The idea of tracking companies that prospered and noting exactly what led to their success surpasses any ""how to"" book I have read. Combining this book with Joseph B Stevenson's ""Building An Internet Based Mail-Order Business"" (ISBN 0-9666403-0-6)could undoubtedly help anyone get the ""head start"" they are looking for."
2,Mostly a bore and poor subtitles,"Even the marvelous Conrad Veidt can't liven this up. Maybe a Lubitch or Mamoulian could improve it a bit. But by the 12th repetition of the same song I was screaming. It is not really an operetta, just a few songs stuck in ad infinitum.And beware, the subtitles are white and disappear frequently when on a white background.If rewritten with a good composer and librettist it could be an enjoyable bit of fluff."
4,There's nothing like it!,"I love this documentary. I only wish I had been fortunate enough to be on one of those double decker bus tours that Timothy Levitch served as the guide for. I didn't know that this film was made in 1998 at the time, but the first time I saw this must have been 1999 or 2000. To watch it again after 10 or 12 years was a treat. I'll probably buy several more copies to give as gifts to friends who have yet to visit New York - not that it will give them any info about the city - but it will most certainly entertain them. I will seek out and purchase one of his (Timothy ""Speed"" Levitch) walking tours that he conducts every now and then so I can meet him and experience my own cruise-a-thon!"
5,LOVE THIS FILM!,"The film is on Sundance right now and I'm compelled to communicate ...Levitch is a hilarious insightful genius, and the film is totally entertaining and thought provoking from start to finish. When I first saw it I came in somewhere in the middle and my instantaneous knee jerk reaction was ""who is this freak?"", until I watched a few more minutes and realized that I was watching a very unique, talented, intelligent, and amazingly funny man. The filming and editing is really superb. Highly recommended."
2,Not worth $2.99,"This film would be okay if it were free on You Tube but there was nothing new from the director or the subject. If you like this kind of thing, ""I Like Killing Flies"" is a much more successful film with a similar bent."
1,who's kidding whom?,"Very disquieting to think that this sort of thing is what people find philosophical, artful or poetic. I had to turn it off after 15 minutes, and wanted to turn it off after less than 10. Total waste of digital media."
1,Self-Indulgent B.S.,"As an ex- New Yorker who is still in love with the place, I found this DVD to be nothing more than the rantings and ravings (in the most obnoxious and grating voice I have ever heard) of Levitch. See if you can stomach it and rent it first. I couldn't bare more than 5-10 minutes tops ...what a disappointment!"
5,Stunning!,"I LOVED this film. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to wait until the price comes down to get it, but I'm eagerly awaiting that day. What I love about this documentary is that you're never sure whether the subject is absolutely brilliant or absolutely nuts. By the end, though, it's clear that it doesn't really matter which is true, because he's free."
5,An incredible glimpse into the mind of a mystic,"This film displays in full glory a most evolved (in my opinion) soverign individual. I just finished watching the film and was so moved, I had to seek more information. Here I recommend this movie to the enitre world... (for the next long time I will recommend it to the small part of the world I encounter...) I think the man documented on this film is brilliant - Speed, if your grandparents aren't proud, please know how proud I am of you! I too ""live by the idiom 'I DON'T KNOW'"" and find your descriptive words to be masterpieces. This movie is a complete inspiration."
5,full out exuberance!!!,"I first saw this movie in the 90's and instantly fell in love with it. The Cruise is an insightful, albeit, quirky love affair between a man and a city. Timothy 'Speed' Levitch is an ultra poetic soul who finds beauty in the aspects of life that everyone else passes by without notice. The Cruise is more than a movie, its a way of life. A particular way of viewing the everyday world that surrounds us all. If you are looking for a tour of New York as a metaphoric journey through your own soul... this movie is for you. If you are looking for directions to Nieman Marcus...choose something else. Thank you Speed and be wary of the anti-cruise...it's everywhere."
3,Good but has a flaw...,"I like this series and so does my daughter however I don't understand why they have a ""pipe"" as a prop. This seems very outdated and inappropriate for young children."
3,Lonely Planet Sinhala Phrasebook,Nice little book even though the language is crazy to try to learn.
2,"Oh, well...","While I certainly grant there are probably some brain differences between men and women, the research here is often dubious at best. I also know quite a few men who would fall into the E category and women who would fall into the S category.Anyway, for one of the prior reviewers - for the record: I am female and am NOT afraid of rats! So much for stereotypes."
2,TL,"This book is chaulk full of time honored science. I can think of one lady whom was an engineer. When I asked her why she was the secretary... she said chemistry is not my thing. The guys are so much better at it. We waste out money pushing sex. Russia figured that out a long time ago. They don't waste their money funding universities which a sexist agenda. Women are more empathetic; now there is a new fact. Wow! We pay staff way to much money. Of course it was the UK that stated we can grow marigolds in moon dust. Wonder what the Chinese are working on these days? Oh ya, they are kicking our butt; their only limit being over population and food. Wait a minute... the UK is an Island?"
3,Ask any married person,Simply put. No need to bring this subject into the lab for analysing by psychologists and medical detectives. Just ask any man who has been married for several years to seperate the differences in the thought process of women and you will find the answers. Ask any woman who has been married for a number of years and she will reveal the differences. No need for monkeys or rats. By the way females are deadly afraid of rats.
3,Slightly disappointing,"What this book says about male and female brains is mostly right, and should be unsurprising. I didn't learn much from it.He makes a good case that some of the features of autism are more typical of the male brain than of the female brain. But he doesn't convince me that this has much significance. I am bothered that he refers to autism as extreme maleness, when there appear to be a number features on which extreme maleness and degree of autism have little correlation (e.g. risk tolerance).The AQ test that he includes at the end looks like it leaves plenty of room for improvement (for instance, I'm annoyed that it offers four choices for each response, but scores the results as if there were only two choices), but it still seems to be the best readily available test of its kind."
5,An interesting read based on science,"Anyone who says this book is sexist didn't read the preface. This book is based on statistical averages. It's not blind stereotypes that most people use to judge the genders; it's rooted in science. If people are offended by this book, they are unlikely to have a (S)-type brain that is able to systematize and appreciate this book for what it is... one man's observations based upon data.This is a very interesting read for anyone who wants to become enlightened about the differences between men and females --- on average. We all know there are exceptions. Right?"
5,Great book,"I'm on chapter 4 of the book. I'm taking an advanced graduate course in algorithem analysis and I completly forgot all of my discrete math, so I'm studing this book on my own. This book starts from scratch and goes to the end. Explains everything that's needed without the formal math that most books include. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to really understand discrete math without pulling their hair out. I looked at other discrete math books like the one by Rose, too much formal math is included. The one by Koshy is to the point, highly recommended. Also, I bought the student solution manaul which solves the problems in details. By the way the book itslef has the solutions also but not in details."
2,It works but not that well...,"Build quality is somewhat disappointing but then you get what you paid for, right? I am basically going to use it only for my digital camera so I am not too concerned about it not being stable enough... but I AM concerned about the fact that it looks like it will break apart in a year. All the knobs are made of very cheap plastic and they are pain the neck to manipulate. The quick release plates are HUGE!!! I am giving it a 2 star because it basically works... nothing fancy but it does what it's supposed to do, just not that well..."
2,Flimsy,"Not recommended. The clamp that locks the angle of the legs broke with very little use, and I was not able to repair it."
1,broken new tripods suck,"My new tripod arrived already malfunctioning. After reading that it would cost almost as much to send it back as to buy it. I got busy with lock-tight and epoxy. It is barely functioning now, but shipping costs make it impractical to send back. I will try to find a different one when this one fails in a couple of weeks."
2,"Trying to do too many things, none of them well.","I was disappointed with this tripod, and it's been the only purchase I've ever returned to Amazon. The materials used for the legs are too fragile, and the whole tripod feels very wobbly with the legs extended.I got this tripod because I wanted to give a ball head a try, but this product suffers from trying to do too many things and as a result does none of them well. I also have a Sunpak6100 travel tripod that feels much more sturdy than this and is significantly cheaper in price.If you want to try a ball head tripod without moving into the Bogen/Manfrotto range, I would recommend spending another $20 and trying one of the Slik Sprint tripods, which feel much sturdier and more professional."
5,memory lane,Music to relax the inner you for 24 hours a day and 7 days for the week. I just love this album gone to bed.
3,slightly disappointed,"If you are looking for instructions on advanced turns, 14 to be exact, then this is the DVD for you. However if your looking for free style, steps, shine for men or ladies, none were included. Diane and Juan warm interplay make learning turns easy, my wife would have like Diane to give more instructions geared to the ladies. Please don't misunderstand me, Although I only gave it a 3 Diane and Juan have excellent teaching skills. We recommend this DVD well worth buying."
3,Nice dvd,I would endorse it because it presents nice dancible combinations and the presenters are clear and friendly with their instructions.It was a bit distracting to hear the clicks of the shoes against the wood floor all the time however and I was sure i heard the horn of a truck in the background at one stage. the set is was to busy with too much to distract from the dancers themselves. Overall a nice dvd though.
2,Not as good as advertised,The batteries did not look like new when received and could not hold the charge very long. Kind of disappointed.
1,Garbage - maybe Defective,My four-pack is garbage/defective. They might hold a charge for a few days. The Eneloops (dark blue and light blue) that I got are far more reliable so far.
4,Better than most,Well it does work well. Put your mask on then attach the snorkel via velcro and you do not get any odd pulling trying to position it for your face. One improvement that could have been made would have been to put a swivel under the velcro so it could also move after it was placed on but anyway for this price it is fantastic!
5,best idea,These work so great!! My grands come over to play in the pool and they've broken so many of the other ones. These little gadgets are the BEST invention!!!
1,Does not lock very well,"clip does not hold very well, lost snorkel twice so far. Once in the ocean(found floating away) and once on the boat deck. safest way to hold on to your snorkel using this clip is to keep it in your BCD."
5,Hollywood Must Be Chomping At The Bit!,"When our hero, Tashum is cast from Heaven...I felt his horror. When Tashum stuggles with the love and disdain that he feels for the vampires and the humans...I understood. When reading Ann Rice, I feel like an observor. I was drawn in to all of the emotions expressed by both Fanny and Tashum. I wanted to be with them in London and Paris during their struggles and adventures. When I have the chance to visit these strange and often exotic places, I will be looking for Fanny, Tashum, and the others. I want a sequel! Thank you for this enchanting and exciting story. I am ordering copies for all of my girlfriends!"
5,GREAT!,"I just need to read more! This book made me dream, made me imagine. Does someone know more about the second part?I love it."
3,"Decent read, but be warned...","I enjoyed this book for the unique perspective on angelic beings and the origins of vampires, but two things bothered me about it. 1) The main character, Tashum, lives in virtual isolation for umpteen thousands of years, which simply isn't believeable. Any being, celestial or otherwise, would go looking for his brethren long before that. 2) The ending clearly indicates there is more to the story, and someone suggested this is supposed to be a series. If I had read this book when it was first published in 2000, I'd still be waiting for the sequel almost nine years later. If I know a story is going to be a series, I don't read it until the last one is published; I just can't stand the wait between publications. Either the author needs to finish what he started or he risks losing his audience."
1,I've Fallen And I Can't Get To Heaven.,Pure nonsense. I looked forward to reading a cool story about fallen angels and got a sort of story about a prissy angel who is a Lestat wannabe and a bunch of vampire idiots. Find something else to read. Thank goodness I checked this one out of the library. That would have been a waste of some good cash.
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is unreadable. The prose is lumpy. The story doesn't flow. The mixture of angels and vampires doesn't work. The ending is just another Sylvester Stallone chase-and-shoot scene. And, worst of all, after 400 pages you get virtually no new clues about the big mysteries of the book (what happened to Paladin, what is the silence in heaven)."
2,"Interesting concept, poorly written","The ideas behind this story are great (fallen angels, angelic creation of vampires, redemption) and the parts of the story that deal with them are engrossing. But the story line is too convuluted and I kept losing interest. The ending was open ended (and such an obvious ploy to get you to buy the next book) and I felt cheated when I finished it. I won't buy the next book."
2,"Better movie, maybe","Ms. Rice was never one of my favorite writers, but there is no comparison of her books to this one. I usually think that a book suffers by becoming a movie, but this would not -- I too kept thinking that it would make a better movie than novel due to Mr. Lord-Wolff's extensive reliance on plot and things visual. But the book has no sense of humor or irony about it at all, and has no ending. Open -ended non-endings work well in fiction that relies more on character development, but in a story like this, where plot is the entire impetus of the book, unresolved questions and ending in the middle of things don't succeed."
2,Ouch. Yikes. Run for your life.,"What starts out as a very interesting premise devolves quickly into a battle between (almost) good and (almost) evil, though it doesn't even quite succeed at even that. ""The Silence In Heaven"" begins with a number of angels being purged from heaven and forced to be earthbound. Then it tells us that it was these angels who ""created"" vampires with their celestial blood. Can you see what's coming? Yes, the angels must battle the vampires for control of the world or mankind or something. And there might be a love story (almost) involved, but since angels have no reproductive organs, it's more of a frottage* story, I would imagine. Anyway, if you're looking for a summer read that doesn't involve a brain or any common sense, then by all means read this book.*The act of rubbing against the body of another person, as in a crowd, to attain sexual gratification."
5,Excellent for $30,"With the mailin rebate this speaker (...). Even with super saving shipment it only takes 3 days to deliver. Excellent speaker for this price, can't ask for more. Nice bass and satellite speaker, I didn't regret buying them at all."
4,ok but less than expected,"the sound that they produce is loud but flat, i was expecting more. also the wood look is great but they didn't pick a very good design/finish to go with it"
4,the best speakers $25 can buy,"I paid $25 for these speakers. they were $35 with a $10 mail-in rebate from Logitec. I waited about a month till the price got that low, they usually sell around $50.Initially I wanted to get the creative I-Trigue 3300 which is about $80 but it sounds great; However, getting these for 25 is a much much better buy. they sound great And I wanted to get a 2.1 system and they are truely great. very loud and clear, very nice design as well.I highly recommend it if you can score one for around or less than $40."
5,brilliant,"i took a serious chance ordering this.and man did it pay off.after about two hours of going back and forthfrom screen to cheat sheeti had 90% of the gestures memorized.it was surprisingly easy to get the hang of.fingerworks went to great pains to make it as intuitive as possible. so much in fact that now, when i'm away from home and using a dated pointing device [mouse] i catch myself trying to use it like my igesture.i did expect it to be a bit larger, but I love it just the same.a very large hats to the people at fingerworks, even inspite of thier terrible website."
1,very very bad item,check engine light was on-Code: said cat/O2 needs replacement;i got this product and got it installed by a mechanic-then reset check engine lights- check engine lights gone- perfect right? wrong!now check engine lights are back on with same code-it worked good for 4 months!PRODUCT IS A SHAM - low/bad quality in my opinion;my original O2 sensors have been on the ACURA car for 220k miles- replaced with this sensor that worked for 4 months and now im back to square one; car is at 224k miles;waste of money! get an original one- this product is a waste of money;i do not recommend this product at all;
4,Absolutely fascinating read!,"Even if you have only a passing interest in Ancient Rome, this work is completely entertaining and informative. It's eye-opening to learn how much the Romans actually knew of the world; knowledge that would be lost for a thousand or more years before being re-discovered. It's also remarkable to see how much they were wrong about. So much of it is genuinely funny, too. A story comes to mind about a dolphin in the port of Ostia that was friendly with the sailors and locals. They became so enamored of it, they ""honored"" it by anointing it with a full cask of perfume! Pliny expresses the confusion felt by those who then watched the poor animal swim off unevenly and not return for several days! Some gratitude!Aside from the fact that this abridgment is just plain fun to read, it provides an insight into the soul of the Roman people that you just can't get from reading Tacitus, Josephus, or Caesar."
5,put into the study room,"If you lean more towards the Academic, intellectual, type things, such as the fields of botany, zoology, astronomy, geology ,mineralogy, and many other things, then this book is for you. I found myself reading the first 50 pages in one sitting then I took a break for about three weeks just to think about it all. Some pretty good reference type material. I ended up finding this book due to my never ending quest for knowledge and I was wondering where the phrase “take it with a grain of salt” originated. I truly enjoy his thoughts on “GOD”. All in all you should never get bored with reading this almost unknown gem."
5,Great condition,"I bought this book used, and it is in great condition. It looks practically new. The context are written in an easily understanding way, entertaining and to a point that it will be an easy read. Shipping time for this book was only a few days.."
2,A stain on this series good reputation,As an introduction for the general reader this is pretty useless. Its actually an older work not intended for the very short introduction series. Its a brief but fairly in depth study of Hume's work with an initial chapter on his life tagged on at the start. It requires at least a basic familiarity with Hume and the reader would almost certainly benefit from having read the Enquiries or even an alternative introduction before engaging with this. Presenting Ayers' book in this way is disingenuous and does both him and the reader a disservice.
2,"Good, but not as an introduction","I agree with the reviewers who found this book unhelpful for readers unfamiliar with Hume's philosophy. It really fails as an introduction, for the plain reason that it doesn't even attempt to be one. Ayer wrote it in 1979 as a series of lectures on topics in Hume's philosophy, lectures originally addressed at a public already familiar with the basics. I certainly agree that introductions should also make us think, but not before providing the knowledge that would make such thinking possible.In short, I think this is a good book if taken on its own terms, and it is not Ayer's fault that the publisher decided to misrepresent it now as an introduction to Hume's thought. I am giving it two stars not because it is not a good book, but because it is not good as an introduction."
5,Hogwash: A very short review,"The title of the series is ""Very Short Introductions,"" not ""Very Short Pedantic Compendiums Written by Arses for Neophyte and Dilettante Consumption Writ Large."" A J Ayer's prose is the modicum of brevity and clarity; who better to write a very short introduction than this 'arch-empiricist' of the logical positivist school? Mr. Rogers? Amy Winehouse? T-bag Blair? Donald Rumsfeld? From the sound of the other reviews, the second title offered above may be valid for much of the rest of the series; this one then, is a very fortunate exception."
5,great cake pans,"These are not your average cake pans. No.1 a nice shiny finish (no more over baked crust,takes less time to cool,and better heat distribution).No.2 these cake pans have a nice straight side (makes a nice layer cake). No. 3 they come in different depth, and size. No.4 not over priced. No.5 comes from amazon (could not find them in a local store).No. 6 these pans have a nice weight. With normal care they should last for many years."
5,The best,"These are excellent!Pros:1) the bends in the metal and the rolled rim are well made and have zero defects.2) They are thick and will not warp, bend, or dent due to normal usage (or even dropping them, I think).3) The finish is good and uniform, making it easy to clean.4) Tall side walls allow you to bake taller cakes in the future (I like the 3"" depth).5) Made in the USA (some town in California, I believe).Cons:1) If you are worried about aluminum in your food, you might want to use a piece of parchment on the bottom when baking with these. There is no protective coating. (On the other hand, nonstick coatings are apparently not good for you either).2) As with other aluminum bakeware, the finish will dull and/or pick up some brown marks after using them for a while. This is normal."
3,Calf size is too large,I ordered these boots because reviewers of other Charles David boots said those styles had very small calves so I took a chance on these... Big mistake. The boots are very high quality but the calves are way too large.
4,Where's the rest??,"Thoroughly enjoyed my first introduction to William Grant Still's music. But the main reason I purchased this CD was for Ellington's Suite, ""The River"" -- and I was disappointed. While what is here is wonderful (and hardly ever recorded) - the liner notes say that there are several more parts of the suite which were not included.The first couple of times I heard ""The River"" it was being played live on PBS. I fell in love with it instantly, hearing not only Ellington's signatures but those of Gershwin, whom I adore.If someone can point me to a complete recording of ""The River"" I would be eternally grateful!!"
5,William Grant Still Afro-American Sym.#1.,"I put this on just before receiving a request to review!I love this recording and the musicians involved. There are otherversions available, but I have only heard this one, made a note andwhen I went on-line for the first time, a friend sent an Amazon giftcard and I ordered this recording. I hadn't listened to it for acouple of weeks and the timing was perfect today. I highly recommendthis music for anyone who wants a beautiful piece of Americana and asample of the music of a great composer. He has written many othercompositions also available. If you like Gershwin, you will like Stll.The Duke Ellington River Suite is, as expected,excellent as well.This was the first of many purchases I have made from Amazon andI am very happy with the products and service. Too much information?What can I say, I am a 66 year old man who is home bound for the mostpart and enjoys the chance to give his opinion."
1,Vignettes with wide angle lenses,"This poor quality, plastic filter vignettes with wide angle lenses due to the depth of the rotating frame. Landscape photography (which is what this filter is mostly used for) will be poorly affected."
5,Warren Jazzed up My Life,"My wife and I recently heard Warren play live at a University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) musical event. I can't believe that I had not heard of him before, especially since I enjoy jazz (esp. Brazilian)guitar types like Charlie Byrd. I immediately ordered, received in great shape, and enjoyed Warren on his Jazz Ruined My Life II album (CD). Thank you, RHS"
1,CHARMING WRAPPER BUT NO CANDY INSIDE,So far each pack opened has been missing product. These are individually wrapped and the paper is there but the candy is missing. Weird but true. Either this was a batch of seconds or the company that makes these has some real issues. And at $20 ($1 for each 1 oz pack) the missing candy is not acceptable. These will go back.
5,I love this book,I bought this to help me out in a class. It has helped me so much. I could refer to it easily. Every med student should get a copy.
1,Article on circumcision,"Having recently assisted at the birth of my son and well informed in the most up-to-date research into the anatomy of the penis and the history and practice of circumcision in the U.S., I read with some surprise and no little chagrin the tendentious and rather uninformed presentation on the subject of circumcision. It is surprising that so little account is taken of penile anatomy or the rights of the subject (most often an infant) of this surgery. In the case of baby boys, no notice at all is taken of circumcision as the surgical removal of significant healthy genital tissue from healthy baby boys. A significant surgical procedure with no medical necessity...seems a bit odd to me. In any event, it certainly casts much doubt for me on the authority of the rest of the manual, which I surely hope stands on firmer scientific footing."
4,Merck Manual,"This is a comprehensive book, detailing nearly every type of ailment known to mankind. Those who judge just one small portion of it (who may or may not have medical degrees to support their opinions) do the work an injustice by focusing on the narrow instead of the entire range of the book.This book is full of detail that the average person can comprehend. At times the book does seem a bit rigid in that certain ailments can only occur in specific parts of the body. Case in point, my wife was diagnosed with a ganglion cyst on her ankle, an uncommon location, but according to the book, such cysts are limited to the wrist.But this does not detract from the overall usefullness of this book as a standard reference. Of course, no book should be the sole source of medical evaluation and doctors must be consulted as the needs arise."
5,A must,This manual is a must for any house. It covers every medical problem out there. It'll inform you and help you. Not recommended for hyperchondriacs...just kidding.
4,Was a gift for a relative,"The majority of these items were Christmas gifts for family relatives, never asked any of them for their opinonswhether possitive or negative on any of the items purchased."
1,This is not a new book,"I was terribly excited to see a new title, and asked for it for Christmas, so I was dismayed to discover that it is a revised edition of ""Miss Manners Rescues Civilization"". If you want Miss Manners at her best, buy Miss Manner's Guide to Extruciatingly Correct Beahvior"" instead."
3,Not very good translation...,"The book is a wonderful Brazilian masterpiece but I think the translation failed to express the poetry and ""Brazility"" in it. I hope there'll be more translations of this novel in English in the future..."
5,best,It's the best and cheapest laptop case you can ever find.It has lifetime warranty and has a very slim and pretty design.I recommend this product specially to women!!
3,Not a Reggae Fan,"But I bought this anyway, after hearing a couple of tracks online on Mark Lamarr's BBC2 show. Actually there's lots of interesting stuff in here, esp. for those w/a more ska preference. Though I do have a ska preference, the collection feels inconsistent to me. Some cuts are much stronger than others, I don't have a feel for the overall sound, & there aren't that many stand-out tracks. An important collection, I imagine, but more for completists than the casual fan."
4,good quality,"I bought this product for school. I liked this product, it was shipped quickly and was exactly how it was described in the description."
3,Good reprint of several articles,"This book is a combination of a number of articles from issues of a very excellent magazine. There have been better, more in depth articles in the mag that would have made a good book better."
3,Coulda been a great printer....,"Most of the time this printer is a winner. Rarely jams, and print quality is excellent. And the duplexer works very nicely. However, after 3 months we've had the machine out of order as much as working, primarily due to inept service techs. But now we think the problem is solved and the printer seems to work perfectly. Unfortunately, it has another problem--toner disappears like beer at a frat party. I haven't tracked pages printed, but with what seems to me like pretty light usage we are going through about $400 worth of toner a month, with only a few people on the printer. If that works for your budget then this is otherwise a decent machine."
1,"Problem-prone, money-sucking machine","This machine creates a beautiful print, but so many of it's components need to be replaced so often each print costs a fortune. If you call Ricoh they glibly state that it is just standard maintenance, even though none of the parts get even close to their stated life-span. We have found that the drums, CPU, and transfer belts, some costing $450 just for parts, barely reach their half-life. If you Google this machine you will find the web flooded with people having problemsBest to steer clear of Ricoh unless you've a trust fund and don't mind waiting for parts just to get a simple print."
1,Pure crap; purchase an HP instead,"This printer is an absolute piece of high-tech junk. Don't even think of trying to print over the network from anything other WindowsXP SP2 workstations. The product ships with plenty of worthless documentation, which is only a step below its completely incompetent technical support. Yes, the tech support reps mostly speak english, but they've all got one oar out of the water, and don't know jack about their own products.Once you get it printing off of the XP workstation, the color print copy suffers from poor resolution and faded lines. This printer suffers from incredibly bad design and absolute engineering incompetence. Stear clear of Ricoh."
2,Printer is just a way for Ricoh to suck hundreds of dollars from your wallet,"This is a FANTASTIC printer. Reliable, clear printing, a work horse although it doesn't double print without an expensive add on. But, you have to replace everything all the time. I think their toners come half empty and we have had to replace the photoconductor unit for both the color and black and white more than twice. We have TWO people in our office and have only had it a couple of years."
2,cheap printer=expensive consumables!,"Welcome to the DISPOSABLE COLOR LASER PRINTER! Had this printer for over a year now, 22,000 prints so far. When it does print well the prints are nice, but once something needs replacing you may as well throw it out and buy a new printer.Doesn't print well on cardstock because thick paper has to feed through the Bypass tray and as it feeds the paper it ""stops"" for a second leaving this obvious over-inked smudge all the way down the paper.I have seen the price of the toner fall over the year, but it sure eats a lot. I replaced the color PCU and black PCU units a few months ago, and am now having printing problems, that's why I am on here to find a replacement printer. Don't replace any parts to this printer, just go buy a new one. Don't even call a tech on it, they are just going to encourage you to replace the consumables...Black PCU $178; Color PCU $225; Fuser $319; toner $125 each color, $55 for black; cost of a new printer, $300. That's priceless!"
4,replacement quick release plate,"Great news.... annnoying news. Great news....this one you can screw on the camera and it really does lock down so I probably won't have the problem of it spinning off the camera which is why I lost the last one. Annoying news...it fits so tight in the tripod slot that it isn't really a ""Quick release"" anymore. It is more of a tight release. Still it works."
3,"Looks well built, not quite pro quality though","To be clear I'm rating this 3 of 5 stars purely on built quality and appearance. This isn't the highest quality item ever, but it is very solid for a plastic molded item (although you can see the injection mold seams). My thumbscrew was nice and tight, which is good since a loose one would be a PITA when trying to quick-connect it with a tripod head. The bubble level looks good enough for most people, but certainly not ""pro"" quality.If you have a tripod that needs a new plate this is a great option for anyone but the most discerning of professionals.FYI I have a Sunpak 7500 series and this does NOT fit, as my tripod needs a larger plate. I simply ordered this one by mistake and am returning it. I'm not factoring my mistake into the quality rating though."
4,Bought as gift,I purchased this as a replacement for a tripod that a family member had. They had lost the plate to attach the camera to. It was a perfect pit for the tripod that I bought it for.
4,GRANDAUGHTERS LOVE IT!,This travel set is loved by all my grandchildren. It keeps them occupied. It allows them to use their imaginations to create scenes.. kind of on the idea of colorforms- but magnetic. There's a few little pieces & 2 extra scenes so be prepared to pick them up if you have little ones. Their enjoyment is very important to me all in all.
4,Grandma,"Smaller than I expected. Little pieces will probably get lost easily. Overall, I probably should have waited a couple years before giving this item to a 2 year old. Older girl might appreciate it more."
4,Do you love football review,"The book is well written, and straight to the heart of any coach regardless of the sport the coach is coaching. I found a lot of insight into the mind of a person who is surrounded by a sport but not yet playing, insight into the players themselves, and insight into the coach who is trying to do all to win. This book covers how a person can fall in love with a game and continue to pursue the game as he gets older."
1,Shallow stuff indeed,"For someone as committed to football as the author, I expected a more detailed view of his experience in college, arena, and pro football. Instead, it looks like he spent a couple of days answering questions from a hack ghostwriter. There is very little detail and most of the important events in his career are glossed over. It really lowers my opinion of the man. Buy the Tom Flores book on football to see how a coach really writes a good biography and teaches you something about the game."
1,What a joke,"Gruden should have spent less time with his ghost-writer during the off-season and more time retooling his team of misfits and cry-babies. The Bucs are awful!! They are Losing With Not Much Heart, Zero Passion and They Are Putting Us All To Sleep."
2,Great coach - dissapointing book,"I loved Gruden when he was with the Raiders - a great coach, a terrific leader, and massively fun to watch. His book, however, is rather dissapointing. Not because he's a bad guy - quite the opposite. He is so reserved in his criticism that the whole book comes off like some sort of ""Wonderful Life."" For example, when talking about Ricky Watters (a player who was obviously a major pain in the a**), he says merely ""For whatever reason, Ricky Watters never really seemed to warm up to me."" And his dodging around Al Davis is even worse - his summary of why he left the Raiders is simply ""My agent, Bob LaMonte, told me that negotiations for a contract extension were going nowhere."" That's it???Great guy, great coach, but a dissapointing read."
3,gruden is good,"This book is an enjoyable read especially if you like football. The one thing that was a bit annoying was his constant use of football play names. It was a bit much. This book isn't like other book's I've read by coaches, it is more like a overview of his life. More of a biography than motivation book which is what I was looking for. If you want to learn more about Gruden in a fast read then buy the book."
4,Great Speakers,These are great speakers for the price. Not the best speakers but for what you are paying they are well worth the money.
1,Wont work for u,"I bought it for my ford explorer, i didnt find the original one so i decide to try this one that said universal. When it arrived i realize it was too short, i needed like 5 of them, i ended up buying a used one."
4,A SAD ENDING,The book goes well until the ending. People willbe allowed to go on but it looks as though theauthor plans to get rid of the robots. Robots arethe mainstay of a series like this. The authorneeds to find a way to make both people and robotslive on together. Getting rid of the robots willnot improve the people. The robots did not makethem lazy. They did that to themselves and shouldaccept the blame and allow all the robots to go on-- 3-law -- new-law and caliban. There are waysthat this can happen. If this is the last book inthis series -- it is a sad sad ending with humansunable to own up to their own problems by blamingthen on robots.
3,A reasonable ending to the trilogy,"The behind the eyes thinking was revealed better in Utopia than Inferno, but I would have liked to have seen more time spent behind Prospero's eyes. Prospero was the only New Law Robot you really get to meet, and for all his faults was complex and manipulative, but unlike Caliban, his thinking was rarely revealed except through overt actions. The governor, formerly police chief had serious planet wide dillemas and his tension was felt more. Since he married his one time adversary Fredda, I would have liked to have seen a more complete interaction than was done. The ending was a bit rushed, and I feel that some serious consequences were not dealt with."
2,Why Mr Moorcock didn't leave poor Hawkmoon alone?,"The Runestaff series was great, one of Moorcock's best. This ""sequel"" reads like bad fan fiction, with all the stigmata bad fanfiction is known for: improbable resurrections, clumsy crossover of storylines, not-so-clear-ending.But Mike is one of those great Authors who can't leave well alone.Read ""The White Wolf's son"" fora better and more apt ""Eternal Champion"" conclusion"
2,Sifting Through Londra's Ashes,"This post-climatic Hawkmoon trilogy's kick-off does not live up to my memories of the first series. On the other hand, I was 13 when I read that. While the story moves along quickly enough, that's what one would expect as there isn't much story there. In fact, the book has little urgency to it, as most of the characters are ""ghosts"" from parallel dimensions. Their plights and ""deaths"" seem no more important than deleting an out-of-service phone number from a database. A fairly interesting cliffhanger is just enough for me to want to dig up the second book, but that's mostly out of nostalgia."
4,gasket set,"It contained some gasket I did not need and was missing some that I did need. Overall, I was satisfied with the purchase."
1,A book of nothingness,There is absolutely no information on this book : no counsel - no explanations - a pinch of a mixed Tao/Buddhist theories. - no lineage. Just an introducing speech to go on the seminars. The art of Wu Wei... but with a price.
2,This is an expensive CHEAPLY made canister,At first I thought I was ordering a set of canisters for $9.99 but realized it was just for one. I thought I would order and see if it was sturdy/nice... I found better ones at TJMaxx. I would not recommend.
4,It's about time!,It's about time someone talked about the other side of the game. It's good to get it from a woman's perspective and from someone who was actually in it.
5,A good Clifford party DVD,"Unlike some other Clifford DVDs that are associated with a holiday or event, this one actually has more than one story associated with holiday or event. In this case there are four part related stories and four other unrelated stories that are nonetheless very nice; they are : The Best Party Ever * Clifford's Big Surprise * Potluck Party Pooper * It's My Party * T-Bone, Dog About Town * Clifford's Big Heart (Inexplicably about Valentine's day, I can't see why they didn't put it on the actual Valentine DVD) * Mimi's Back In Town * The Best Gift. I love the stories about Mimi, I'll just put that out there. The one thing I'll say about this DVD is that it does have two stories featuring Jetta heavily, who, if you've seen any of the other Clifford stories you'll know, is just unsufferably obnoxious. Still, if you can stand her, this is a good DVD for a party or whatnot."
1,Poor Transfer,"What a poor transfer. It's like watching a beat up VHS tape. I usually like everything from Code Red/Shriek Show/Anchor Bay DVD's but god this movie was badly made. This movie was made in 1977 but the transfer and cinematography looked like an underground adult movie from the early 1970's. Everything was all blurry and grainy. Even before the film started the DVD titles stated that ""Some film have been lost and some picture quality isn' perfect"". Boy, that's an understatement."
2,Similar problems with durability,"I had an experience remarkably similar to fortinaa's. In my fourth week the base started spinning freely even when the screw for that axis had been tightened. When I attempted to tighten the head onto the monopod the attaching screw separated, leaving a stud with one-quarter thread projecting from the monopod. After only a few weeks, I have a useless monopod."
3,"Nice design, but cheaply built!","I bought this monopod specifically to take to Kentucky for the Rolex Horse event. I got it beforehand and familiarized myself with its features, which were pretty impressive for the price. It seemed sturdy enough. The leg locks aren't the easiest to operate, but they lock well. Unfortunately, it broke in the first day of actual use! With a digital rebel and 2.5lb lens mounted, the head started to spin off of the base. When I hand tightened it back up, the screw snapped in half! That left part in the head and part in the leg with no way to fix it on site. What a bummer. So, decent for the price, but build quality could be beter."
1,Garbage,"As soon as I got it out the box the strap came unglued. I thought nothing of it and tied a knot to secure it. Within the next 3 weeks the spring lock stopped staying tight, the top leg lock stripped itself and you could see the top of the unit slowly coming apart. Due yourself a favor and read the other reviews on this unit. Junk."
3,"Works for wireless gameing, but disconects alot",I bought this after my Microsoft adapter stopped working. This works for connecting to the internet but you get disconnected every 15-20 minutes which sucks.
4,works fine,does fine on my original xbox and my xbox360. no installing. just cant choose a certain access point with it.
5,Keep this close by!,"Simply the easiest, handiest, ""essentials"" book on new baby. THE MANUAL. We worked this program with our two little ones, and it simply works great IF you follow it to the letter. There are some hard things to do in here, but if you seriously follow it, babies and parents will all be happier!"
1,Is this pan supposed to be leak-proof?,"I'm new to cheesecake pans, so perhaps I'm not doing something right, but the pan that was delivered to me is not even remotely leak-proof. The removable bottom does not fit snugly - it slides all around, and it doesn't sit flush to the bottom of the pan. There are gaps along the edge. If I'm meant to wrap this thing in foil before putting anything in it, then I guess it's fine and I'll update my review. Other than some scratches, it looks fine enough. However, if this pan is meant to be leak-proof, it completely fails. I ran it under the faucet, and water poured (not dripped) from the bottom."
2,I was shocked as the pan doesn't look new at all.,"When I received this pan, I was shocked because the pan did not look like new at all. It had many scratches and the outside metal had layers of different colors, dark and light.I almost returned it actually, but I was in hurry and needed a pan with removable bottom sized 9 x 2.5. I had a similar pan 10x3 from Fat Daddios, which was quite satisfactory, but they seem not to have 2.5 hight. That is why I ordered from Parrish Magic Line this time.Anyway, the cakes I baked with this pan so far, one cheese cake and one sponge cake, were satisfactory and uniformly brown. You have gotten scratches if you use any pans many times anyway; so, it is probably OK, but the first impression was definitely very bad."
4,like the pan,liked everthing about pan except removing my ricotta pie from bottom of pan. Next time i will buy special cake spatula to run around bottom of pie before trying to remove pie. this time i used a knife and it didn't work as i expected. i would definitely reccomend this pan.
2,Parrish Magic Line Cheese cake pan,I ordered 2 pans they were suppose to be leak proof WHAT A JOKE after receiving the first ones they leaked all over I returned them and received 2 others same problem I wound up giving them to a charity store Don't waste your money I purchased Kaiser pans and have not had any problems
5,Lose Yourself in the Story,"This is one of those you will listen too time and again! Crisp clear audio, good character voices by the actors. Excellent audio special effects. All easily heard in the environment of a car. The story is great also: four ranchers had settled an old grant...legally, when suddenly a young Mexican brings in a few head and claims some of the range. Things begin to fly apart after that. Then the rain quits falling and things begin to dry up... An excellent buy!"
5,Wonderful adaptation; great production value,This is one of the most interesting and complex of Louis L'Amour's audio adaptations. The characters are three-dimensional and all operate in believable yet human ways. The production values are really superb. A very well-done adaptation.
3,SMALL,"As dog toys go, these are much too small to be of any real use. As children's toys they are spot-on."
2,Falls apart,"I've had to throw most of them away due to the loose stitching and the squeakers being exposed.,I don't want my dog to ingest the plastic."
5,pure pleasure,"Hands down best dog toys for small breed dogs, goes well with the nest or on their own . I hide them thruout the house to keep dog busy while at work"
2,my dog didn't care for these,"They are really cute - but he didn't like them, I'm not sure if it is the placement of the squeaker or the size of the toy or what. Sorry!"
3,15' lead,"This lead is pretty good.. It's thin though. I have another with much more substance to it..but I am using it on the walk. The handle is quite large and I will have to sew it closed a bit more as I have a dog who loves to run, sans her owner."
3,Good Toy but not durable.,I have a male boxer. He really likes playing with the squirrels but they don't last long. There is an air bladder inside the squirrel that tends to get crushed. After that they don't squeek anymore. He still plays with them but not as much after they stop squeeking.These would probably be great for a smaller dog. For my dog I now try to get toys meant for larger dogs so that they last longer.
3,Great concept...not a real challenge,Like the thought but it was too easy for my dogs and quality/durability not great...I love the interactive toys but this one falls short of any type of a challenge for my 3 dogs.
5,MY DOGS LOVE THESE!,"i have somewhat finicky chihuahuas and they absolutely LOVE the hide-a-squirrel! over the course of a few months, the original squirrels got torn up, so i was happy to see that amazon sells replacements. although after shipping, i might as well buy a whole new set. but otherwise, great toy. i don't know what it is, but it's the only stuffed toys my dogs will play with. just be weary that the ""large"" size squirrels aren't very big. they're perfect for my chihuahuas, so if you have a larger dog, i suggest getting the bigger ones."
5,Squeaking Squirrels,"My dog, Halli Beary, LOVES these squirrels!!! Could be because they're smaller than her or because of the squeaking noise they make when she's playing with them. She is on her 3rd set because they are her favorite and only toy. I'm glad to see that I can order only replacements instead of the entire toy set, which includes a soft tree stump. Great quality as they withstand her 5 pound intensity!!"
2,Dog loves them,My dog loves them but they only last about 30 minutes with my chihuahua mix. Only reason that I took off points is the material is weak.
3,These are not Large,"The squirrels I received were notably smaller than the ones that come with the Large tree stump. These work fine with the large stump, but are much easier to pull out of the holes. Not as much fun as the original Large squirrels. They are still fun, but not what I had expected."
3,Small squirrels,"I was a bit disappointed with the size of the replacement squirrels. I purchased the jumbo stump with squirrels for my dog for Christmas and he loved it but destroyed the squirrels pretty quickly. I order a set of replacement squirrels, size large, thinking they were the same size that came with the full stump set as the toy size seemed to refer to the size of the ""stump"". These toys are much smaller and do not hold his interest as much as the larger squirrels because they are much easier to get out of the stump."
5,My dogs LOVE these little guys.,"My house has been invaded by tons of these little squirrels because they are the favorite toy of all four of my dogs, including the giant one. These toys are very durable and stand up pretty well to aggressive play. They do tend to eventually lose an ear or two, but it takes awhile. I haven't had one with a dead squeaker yet, and my dogs can manage to kill almost and squeaker. I highly recommend them."
3,"Quickly destroyed, LOTS of stuffing everywhere.","I give it 3 stars because my Siberian Husky LOVES these in combo with ""Kyjen Egg Babies Dog Toy, Original Series, Platypus"". It has a pouch you are suppose to put eggs into, but you can stuff these in there as well!It makes them last far longer, and my dog finds these squirrels much more interesting than an oval egg.I'll confirm what you are probably expecting. These things last MAYBE 5 minutes otherwise.They also contain an astonishing amount of stuffing for their size, which means it'll be EVERYWHERE.In other words, only get these if you get the other toy to stuff them into. Your dog will love you, and they'll last FAR longer. Otherwise, these will last 5 minutes each (15 minutes total), which is also how long it'll take you to clean up the mess."
4,Yellow lab loves them,"I have purchased these products multiple times now. They are my puppy's favorite toy. We call them her ""guys"" and have had to create a ""guy hospital"" to repair them on a regular basis. The only reason I can't give them five stars is the fact that she DESTROYS them. More her fault than the products and I will continue to repair and replace them for as long as she enjoys them"
1,Item is not as described or pictured,"Product description indicated ""Kyjen Squeakin' Animals Replacement Squirrels for Hide-A-Squirrel Toy, 3-Pack - Large"" and there is no way these toys can be considered any thing but small. Definitely not useful for a 90 pound dog but we can at least give them to our friends for their smaller dog."
5,Great Guitar Music,"Stefan was good when he was with La Vienta, but now he is even better. The tracks on this album are an incredible fusion of Jazz & Flamenco. Want to hear a true samba, check out sweet samba. This CD is a must!"
3,It's fine...,"It's great for its introduction on how to involve children in learning about cooking. It introduces ideas about smell, texture, taste and so forth. There are other books that are more modern and with better recipes. This is fairly inexpensive though."
4,Total Entertainment,"So..I had some time to kill while doing my laundry and saw this movie was on my ONDEMAND. I decided to take a chance and watch it. I was surprised to be completely entertained through the whole film. There are some points where the acting is a bit overdone and the story does have a few ways it could be improved...but... how many big budget, over advertised, movies have crappy acting and yet make a lot of money just because they are either A) a sequel to a famous franchise (how many Jason movies do we need?) or B)have big name actors. This film is pretty darn good. I believe more movie makers should quit trying to make the next big, arty, trend setting, overly thought out movies and just do what films should REALLY be...a couple of hours of decent entertainment. I beleieve this movie accomplishes just that."
2,Reality or Hallucination?,"For most of this movie, I thought it was quite an interesting situation and it was quite captivating. Then, suddenly, it started an ending that left both my wife and me utterly confused and feeling we'd wasted our time watching the film. It seems that the movie makers couldn't tell the difference between reality and hallucinations any more than the apparent patients could."
5,Great Little Book!,"I had to use the Spanish version of this book in high school, and while it's not great for grammar (none), I did learn a ton of vocabulary and set phrases.I haven't looked through the Japanese version completely yet, but it looks like it will deliver just as I'd hoped. The themes are extensive and in-depth, with lots of phrases and questions for different situations. The phrases are presented in romaji and kanji/kana and there is a chart in the back for hiragana and katakana. Each section includes a cultural commentary on the topic.While I wouldn't recommend this book as a study of the Japanese language, any gaijin looking to survive in Japan either as a tourist or to live should find it extremely helpful. I gave it 5 stars for being a great source for survival material."
3,No CD and I guess it is my fault,The add was misleading after 3 countries and 15 years I was starting on Japanese with the best book and CD or tape I have come across. But now I find I must order CD alone. The add shows a CD set and then under a small box said order on its own. Very sad they had to resort to a small deseption just to make a few bucks. I will read Amazon adds a little closer from now on. My first not 5 star review.
5,Truly Amazing,"I truly enjoyed this book. It was funny, suspenseful and unbelievably hard to put down. I'm looking forward to the sequel in the Casey Family series. The words just flowed to the point where I could visualize it playing out before me. An exceptional read full of intriguing characters. This is a must read book if you want to be entertained with good characters and excellent writing."
4,Enjoyed all the books out,"Would have given 5 star but, the books are left with such a cliff hanger you have to get the next one to have any resolution.The last in the series was a bit of a let down because it felt like it just abruptly stopped"
2,Good Beginning But...,"Interesting story that starts off well but in the last fourth of the book ultimaltely takes a turn towards the unrealistic, corny, and predictable in a big way. I really wanted to like this book to the end but too often improbale reactions and dialog turn the characters into unbelievable personalities with unlikely qualities."
3,He's not Marc-André Hamelin,"Geoffrey Tozer deserves our applause for bringing the solo music of Medtner to our attention in modern times. But the performances on this disc have been superseded by the incredible traversal, in a boxed set, of the sonatas plus other pieces, by Marc-André Hamelin, who is the most amazing pianist in this sort of repertoire before the public today."
5,You need this!,Grateful Dead ~ Widespread Panic ~ Phish.....Shall I say more. The Radiators have been around for years.....The Law of the Fish is an excellent album as well.....however this album has a sassy trombrone solo to take it up a notch.....excellent...buy it now!
2,Skip it,"Each chapter in the book shows making of another model, from beginning to end. Each model is of a German vehicle, and that's how the book got its title. All in all it seems just coincidental - the book would be no better or worse if it was not the case.The book is definitely targeted at beginners, and it does an OK job, but nothing more. Some advice seems questionable - for example preshading with a Sharpie; in my experience it'll seep from underneath any kind of paint.Overall the book was disappointing for me. It may be of some use for a beginner, but that's about it."
5,Best Video for Advance Level,"If you are an advance level salsa dancer, this video is for you. It's the best videos I ever bought. Lot's of advance techniques."
1,"Introductory Moves, focus on buying another product.","I purchased the DVD and cannot return it. The focus is on one man turning a lady. This happens over and over and over again. So what? Who cares about turns, we can all turn. I would suggest Salsacrazy DVD's they explain the steps and go through lots of patterns.Save your money for something worth buying."
1,Ignorance,"Amazing that freedom of speech allows for the perpetuation of ignorance. Is there a book by this author that says the haulocost never happened too? Who is the publisher? I know I won't be purchasing any of their publications from this day forth. Educate yourselves you web literates don't remain ignorant for the rest of your lives. Always remember, don't believe everthing you read. It's obvious christian propaganda."
1,Very Misleading,Having read all of the reviews I must first of all say that Satanists don't worship the devil. That is called something else. Since you all have access to the internet why don't you look it up? Just a thought. Then at least you won't make ignorant suggestions. Now about the book. Halloween may be an old Pagan tradition but I would also like to say that Pagans don't worship the Satan either. In Pagan religions the devil doesn't exist. Satan was invented by Christianity. Basically then the book is about the evils of Halloween a harmless Pagan festival for the dead given a bad reputation by Christians who were the ones to invent the devil in the first place. I have a plea to all of you out there. Unless you know something about something don't write a book about it. Let your kids celebrate Halloween after all it is a harmless piece of fun. Kids have no idea what the signifigance is anyways.
1,Complete and utter nonsense,"Poorly researched, badly organized and written, illustrated with movie stills and lifted illustrations, there isn't a single page in this absurdity that's not full of factual errors. At least it's good for laughs. And check out the back cover author photos - are you trying to tell me those are two different people?"
1,What a horrible book!,Talk about putting incorrect information in print! Apparently the author did no research and only consulted some fundamentalist religious fanatic. Halloween is rooted in ancient pre-christian pagan custom.. Not Satanism! Such ignorance always amazes me.
1,Ignorant Christian Right Paranoid Spew,"This novel is yet another example of authors exploiting the ignorance of many Christans. Halloween may be based on ancient Pagan holidays, but it is totally harmless. Don't let this tabloid trash get to your head, they are simply feeding on people's blind fear."
1,geez! the devil is not trying to start an uprising!,"It's halloween. based on ancient Pagan holidays, it is harmless. Going from door to door collecting candy is not going to make your children worship the devil! Demons be gone!"
1,"Authors don't ""suffer a witch to live""...","Sick, pathetic, sad and false from start to finish. At one point the authors report about the horrendous torture of a ""witch"" during the Inquisition, and after the gruesome and heartbreaking details, they actually say (pg. 120) ""lest the above-quoted author's description of the terrible torture put upon witch ""suspects"" cause you to become sympathetic toward witches, bear in mind God's commandment towards those who practice it...death. Exodus 22:18 says Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.""That just about says it all, I think. So much for Christianity being a religion of ""love."" The whole book stinks, and anyone who reads it and can take it at face value, just isn't very intelligent. Anyone who agrees with the author that witches should die, would show that intolerance is alive and well in this century."
1,Amazing.,"Sorry guys, I'm still not convinced that Satanism and paganism are in any way related, seeing as how paganism and the traditional (I emphasize the word ""traditional"") celebrations of this holiday were around long before the advent of Satan. I don't have anything against Christians - I do, how ever, have an opposition to bias, poorly researched, dare I say ""fabricated"" lies and nonsense, no matter who peddles them to the masses...Two thumbs way up!"
1,Does this guy know what he's talking about?,"Obviously not! And to the reviewer below me, we pagans hate this book, and don't ""tolerate"" it because it's lesson is one of total intolerance! Duh!"
1,Interesting - Impossible to find any proof,I would like to find any proof of those theories. I have looked for some but I never find anything to Hindu legend close to what Matlock says.
4,Big MacInnes fan not too disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Helen MacInnes' work and would love to see all 4 of the movies based on her books. Unfortunately, only 2 made it on video. I now own both and am not disappointed with either one.While this movie does seem dated to today's eyes, it is a good movie. MacInnes' books are extremely meaty and, while not all could be translated to screen, this does a good job of staying true to the story w/o using everything from the book. I also think that those who have no interest in the book would still enjoy the story, although not if you can't appreciate the fact that it is dated by today's standards."
3,ok,Jabuti is a talented tortoise. He lives in the Amazon rain forest. He can play his flute well but brags too much to his fellow animals. There is a concert in heaven and vulture offers to fly Jabuti there. Find out how the vulture gets revenge!
5,Terrific mosaic book!,"The subtitle of this book is Dazzling Projects and Innovative Techniques and it certainly delivers! It's full of rich, vivid, full color photographs and instructions for interesting and creative projects, most of them 3-D. I was very excited to learn about epoxy putty and how to use it to create curved structures out of backer board or wire. A few of my favorite projects in this book: Snake-In-The-Grass, Gazing Face, and Reflecting Birdbath with View. Your garden will never be the same!"
4,"Unfortunately for me, this is a Rerun!","OK, I give this four stars because it IS good. BUT, be careful! Jill MacKay co-authored another book on this subject. It is frustrating to purchase a ""new"" book only to discover that it is filled with many of the same patterns and images from another on my shelf. This book is like a rerun of McKay's part in ""The Pattern Companion"". For someone who has never picked up that book, this, I think, is the better choice to purchase. There are many clever ideas here - some new ones, as well. I only wish I had known that half of the book was already in my possession. I wouldn't have purchased this one."
4,Front fork motorcycle stand,"This stand is a great deal for the price. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is there are better stands out there. BUT, they are way more exspensive. Also you can't do any work to the forks with this stand as the bottom of the forks rest on the stand. It is awesome for tire changes and brake work though. Two thumbs up!!!"
5,Taxi Dog is a Heartwarming Ride,"Truly one of the best children's books out there. The illustrations are incredibly rich, colorful and detailed and the story is so inventive and charming. I love Maxi! I bought this book today and read it to my 4 month old daughter. It held her attention the entire time--quite a feat! It's no wonder--the beautiful lyrical story with its rhymes and the gorgeous artwork are a delightful combination. I can't say enough about this charming story. What a plus that proceeds of the book go to a worthy animal cause. I want to see more of Maxi's adventures!"
5,My kids and I adore this book!,This is a wonderful story for children. I have bought several and given them as gifts. I always get comments from parents about how much their children love this book. The rhymes are enjoyable to read out loud.
4,Learning from a pro,"I find Ed's book to be a good teaching experience for me. With technology moving so fast, I find it hard to keep up. Mr. Yourdon has been very kind in answering my email when I found myself needing help with a problem.He shares his knowledge in a manner in which I find easy to understand. I'd recommend his book(s) to anyone."
4,"Thought provoking, well written book","I am neither friend or foe of Ed Yourdon, just an avid reader. The information in the book is very interesting and gave me many puzzling thoughts before falling asleep. His website is very informative and has nothing to do with religion, race, or creed, just intelligent information for the intelligent seeker."
4,Excellent work by Yourdon!,Ed has been able to put things into a unique and thrilling perspective in this book concerning certain relevant security elements and 9/11! A must read for everyone!I have seen Ed's work for years and I might add that he would never be associated with any group as listed by the first reviewabove..I feel this person is a troll and should be reported!
1,Nothing New,"This is essentially a rehash of other works as well as his previous Time Bomb 2000 book. If you're an IT professional, then you'll learn nothing new here. If you aren't, then this book won't be particularly useful. What's especially disappointing is the fact that he's using the 9/11 disaster to sell what is essentially a work of common knowledge. On the plus side, he's at least refrained from the wild speculation that made up much of Time Bomb 2000."
1,Pointless,"In his last book, TimeBomb 2000, Ed Yourdon stated that the Y2K phenomenon would be more pervasive and serious than anything we've experienced in modern history. Having missed the boat on that one, he now offers us a hastily-written compilation of glossed over tips and information about IT security in general. Much of it has nothing at all to do with 9/11, which is understandable since it has happened so recently. The book is okay in and of itself, but the title is clearly misleading and there's really nothing new offered here that hasn't already been available in dozens of other books."
4,A very important read in today's climate of cyber-terrorism,"Ed Yourdon has a distinguished reputation in the IT field. Many of his books have been required reading for IT professionals. In this latest work, Mr. Yourdon details what direction the IT industry will need to take in the ""new world paradigm"" of international terrorism. I consider this work an important part of the ever-evolving task of keeping your company's information systems and data secure."
1,Wait for a better book,"Ed Yourdon's most well-known recent work is probably TimeBomb 2000, a book that inspired so much unwarranted fear that one terrified couple on his Internet forum attempted to give away their newborn grandchild to complete strangers in hopes that it would survive the terrible Y2K rollover. Indeed, Yourdon himself was quoted as saying that the likelihood that the various Y2K ""trigger dates"" would pass without incident was equal to that of pigs learning to fly.Thankfully, Byte Wars avoids such ridiculous predictions and hysteria, but instead offers the reader no new insights into information technology and little to nothing relating to 9/11. Yourdon is a true Master of the Obvious in this book, which apparently capitalizes on the 9/11 tragedy without actually addressing it. If you're looking for real insight into the effects of 9/11 on the IT industry, I would wait a few more months for a more relevant work. This one just doesn't cut it."
5,Pick up books,"It's a word without words these days. I can only imagine that once people were telling their kids to put down the books rather than their video games, TV, or to get off the computer. Now, with all the gagets and technologic advances, books are becoming obselete. What to do to make kids not just readers but to be literate enough to get by in the world? This is a great how to for parents and educators (short and sweet) about how to get kids to read not just as kids but to condition them for life."
5,Works great! Easy to use,Easy to use. Good results as long as you dry off the vehicle after washing. if you don't dry it off you will get water spots. I highly recommend this product. Saves alot of time.
2,A primer for starting over.,"Written by Trent Sands, this books can at best serve as a primer for establishing identity in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. It falls far short of being useful for the actual acts which it portrays to be designed. It does give some overview information on the process, and that alone is useful. However, the real identity seaker is going to find many blocks to using the methods presecribed. Use it as a starter, not as a guide."
5,Loved it,I found serious discrepancis between what I was taught in school and what I was seeing in old 1800s courthouse documents in the South.This book was very helpful in clarifying that what I was taught in school isn't necessarily the WHOLE (or even half) truth!
4,"Good, Not great","I bought this box thinking I would get a full set or something close, but ended up getting about 80%, not bad, but I dont want to have to buy two boxes to get the full set. Got all the main players, Federer, Nadal, Roddick, Sampras, Agassi, but would of liked to see who I missed. Very low price though."
3,good information-more technical than I wanted,"This publication is very nice and comes every week. But, it is a bit more technical than I had wanted. I was looking for more hobby type farming and this has more commercial information. It still has a lot of information and I do enjoy reading through the magazine."
5,FarmWorld Review,"This is an excellent and useful product. In an age of questionable media, FarmWorld stands out as a newspaper that relates to all those with interests related to the farm and ranch. Thank you for this publication and Amazon's usual tremendous service!"
1,Parrish majic line cheesecake pans,After reading the reviews I purchased these pans after I had purchased another brand - which was also a disaster - and these were just as bad as the other brand. The pans were not commercial quality but heavy duty household quality at best. I have purchased heavier baking pans from department stores than these so call commercial quality pans. The bottoms were warped leaked all over the place after they heated up and I spent more time cleaning the oven than making the batter. I would not recommend these or the other brand for cheesecake baking. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5,Fantastic!,"This is indeed a great DVD. Geldof is not afraid to say what he thinks or feels, and that's what helps this to be more than just another travelogue or documentary. The camera work/cinematography are top-notch and his story holds your interest throughout. By turns illuminating, hopeful, magnificent, as well as sad at times, this one is a keeper. Well done Bob!"
2,Good Information; Mediocre Recipes,"This book, while providing very good information on nutrition recommendations during pregnancy, falls short on the recipes. I tried several of the recipes, and each one left out pertinent information. I would also say that I have read the same nutrition information in other pregnancy books, so it is not really worth buying, in my opinion."
2,"Same old, same old","There is no information in this book that I haven't read or been told before. This morning I tried to make one of the recipes from the book, the ""Wholesome Whole-Grain Muffins"" and they were a disaster. Behan instructs that this recipe makes 18 muffins, but I used 18 muffin cups and the batter overflowed and made my kitchen smell terrible (not great when a pregnant woman is feeling nauseous anyway) and they are burnt on the edges and not quite cooked in the middles. This is coming from someone who loves to bake and has a little experience behind making muffins. The batter was very watery and the small taste I took (what I could stand after smelling burnt batter all morning) was very, very sweet. I would not recommend purchasing this book."
5,A great book for women who worry about weight while pregnent,This book is very reassuring for any woman who is pregnant and worries about keeping the weight on after birth. The focus is on a healthy pregnancy but it gives the facts about what to expect about weight. I found it very comforting and empowering
2,Disappointed,"This is my third pregnancy and I don't want to gain as much weight as I have in my two previous pregnancies. I was disappointed by The Pregnancy Diet because it failed to tell me how to control my weight and cravings. I was looking for more information on eating healty filling foods, not cutting back on my meals."
4,"Comprehensive and handy guide, not as legally up to date","Very useful and comprehensive guide on illegal drugs in the US, covering history, chemistry, use, effects on the human body, abuse (like the title says...). It is not the most up to date on current laws, for example the disparity between potential jail time for cocaine vs. crack has evened out recently. There have also been a bunch of laws passed this year that attempt to cover the loophole of making endless chemical variations of the same designer drug (i.e. make chemical formula illegal, another pops up).Still an extremely useful, easy to read and comprehensive guide. For the most up to date legal stuff, look elsewhere."
4,Good not great,The author is strongly against the War on Drugs and he tries to provide as neutral as possible a look at the facts. He is certainly not anti-recreational drugs which I found to be a nice change. It has a good history of drugs and their effects but it could have had more practical information e.g. I wanted to know how much marijuana to use for oral consumption as compared to how much I smoke and this book was of no help.Overall good beginners summary of history and effects of common recreational drugs. Good not great
5,An easily accessed encyclopedia of basic information,"Illegal Drugs: A Complete Guide To Their History, Chemistry, Use And Abuse by Dr. Paul M. Gahlinger (Professor of Medicine, University of Utah) is a comprehensive, easily accessed encyclopedia of basic information surveying the vast variety of addictive, incapacitating, and/or deadly chemicals that have plagued human societies. From opiates to amphetamines, anti-drug laws and drug testing to legal psychoactive drugs such as alcohol, Illegal Drugs provides a wealth of information in a direct and easy-to-look-up matter, further aided by the extensive index. Written in terms the non-specialist general reader can easily understand Illegal Drugs is as complete and thorough a reference as one can find without consulting college-level textbooks or professional medical references. Highly recommended for personal, professional, academic, health agency, and community library pharmaceutical reference collections."
5,Good Insight,"The subject of illegal drug abuse in the US and all around the world is explored in this book. The book provides thorough information about chemical charateristics, type of drug, street names, origin, the ethnic group or race the drug is associated with, synthetic forms of the drug as well as an interesting history of the particular drug and their use dated back centuries ago!Overall I found this book an informative, engaging read and would strongly recommend it to anyone!"
3,Incredibly wonderful work-- until the end!,"How I loved this book. Amelie Nothomb's prose is elegant and original, and I was drawn in to the character of Plectrude and her mother Clemence. However, toward the end of the book, the character of Clemence undergoes drastic changes that are, even with the strong possibility of mental illness, not believable. And then, literally in the last 5 pages of the novella, things go haywire. One review called the book's ending ""cheekily ubsurdist"". That is all well and good, but unfortunately, the bottom line is that the ending is HORRIBLE. The book just stops. It's very bizarre, and really does read as though the author completely lost interest in the story altogether and created a ridiculous ending to be done with it all. I rate a three because the writing is so lovely, and the idea so intriguing, yet it is all trashed in the last 5 sad pages. I was truly disappointed."
3,Abrupt ending!,"The Book of Proper NamesVery interesting. We have a nineteen year old getting ready to have a child. She is peculiar to say the least. Her husband gets on her nerves and so she shoots him. She goes to prison for his murder. Has the baby girl, names her a very peculiar name and then hangs herself. So the baby girl goes to live with an aunt and uncle. They raise her, the aunt wanting to live out her own dreams through the girl. Eating disorders and mental illness abound in this book.I did enjoy this book, but the ending just really jarred me and left me feeling like I was asleep for part of the book. --"
4,How does he do it.,"RA Salvatore has done it once again with this novel of the heroic Drow Ranger Drizzt DuOrden and the heroes of the hall.Action, Adventure, love, and fatasy, need i say more"
2,Way too easy,"Let's first start by saying that I have thoroughly enjoyed almost all of the books Salvatore has written but it seems lately that the plots start with much intrigue and then they go POOF! the climax just disappears. Salvatore leads you to believe that that the pirate group is potentially very dangerous but when the fighting actually occurs, Drizzt & company mop up the floor with them.I truly loved the first two series featuring Drizzt and company (have read them about five times) but lately things have just been too easy with no real challenges. Salvatore is definitlely capable of much better story telling than this. I will continue to read but I hope things improve."
3,Mediocre- but only because Mr. Salvatore has a high standard,"This book, while a quick read, is not the best of the books chronicling the adventures of Drizzt and company. It does succeed in reuniting the principle participants of adventures past, but the antagonists were frankly no where near the class of Jarlaxle and Artemis, or the Shard for that matter. Hopefully now that the companions are reunited, Mr. Salvatore can move on into more exciting adventures for the group. I do believe, though, that we won't see too much more of Drizzt from the author, so enjoy this offering for what it is, and eagerly await the next one!"
4,Drizzt and Catta-brie (finally),"What a great story! Drizzt and Catta-brie are finally an item (sorry, no overt romance or sex scenes), something I've been waiting for. Capt Deudermont and his crew are revisited, Wulfgar finally gets back in the action and finds love in the process, and an old thread is wrapped up from previous stories (not to my satisfaction, but oh well). The only thing that could have made this story better in my opinion is if that ""old thread"" had lived and realized her mistake. What a life, wasted!"
4,Perfect prequal to The Thousand Orcs,"This story starts off rather slow, showing how Drizzt helped Ten Towns with their Highway men problem. But it soon picks up into the main story, getting Wulfgar and getting Aegis-Fang back from the pirates. This book is very eventful, gives wonderful battle scenes in the open sea, and does not waste time with painfully slow details. Read this book first if you want to read The Thousand Orcs."
4,"Not Salvatore's Best, But Still Great","This book is mainly used to bring the seperated party members back together again. Some of the plot is a bit shallow and thin, and the ending leaves a bit to be desired, but overall, the book is fantastic. Drizzt fans will be happy that he and the rest of the companions are back, after their absence from the last two books. The book is action packed, and furthers the plotline greatly. The book plays like a movie in your head, and I couldn't stop reading it til the end. If you've read the others in the series, then pick this one up too... it will not dissapoint."
5,The Companions Reunited,"Sea of Swords is an excellent novel written by one of fantasys' best authors, R.A. Salvatore. The novel takes a slightly different route from previous writings, drawing out certain parts to excellent detail. This allows for more character development and more story, which in my opinion is a key point to any good piece of writing. There is still enough action in there to keep the lulls to a minimum, as well as a good bit of humor (dry or not.) If there is one thing I did not approve of, it was the disappointing display of fighting put forth by Le'Lorinel despite years of training to do battle with the renegade Drizzt Do'Urden. However, it was not enough of a disappointment to lessen my love of this book. R.A. Salvatore has proven yet again that he is one of the finest fantasy writers of our times. Keep up the excellent work, Mr. Salvatore, as your fans are, as usual, wanting more."
2,Not his best at all.,"There is no depth. You can't even compare this to the Silent Blade or Servant of the Shard. Both are amazing Books. He just seems to be running through the motions on this ""one more drizzt book"". It was a fast read and had some good parts, but without characters like Jaraxle and Enterti the book has no real villian to test the hero's strengths. One thing i am glad about is there is no more Dark elves. I was going crazy reading about Loth and all the countless dark elves. Just for that I will give it two stars."
4,GOOD BUT>>>,"Being a big fan of all the Dark Elf Books I have learned much about the details of the characters. This book has a glaring flaw in it. Mainly dealing with Drizzt's frostbrand. Overall I thought the book was very entertaining and I enjoyed it thouroughly. Its just those 2 or 3 instances where its almost like Salvatore doesnt even remember his own characters devices or their powers. I'm trying not to be specific so as not to ruin it for anyone. Just be on the looks out in the book. Not his best work, but not his worst."
3,Close but no cigar,"I had high hopes for this book. I've enjoyed all of his books except for ""The Spine of the World."" That book focused on Wulfgar the barbarian and unfortunetly this book devotes a large portion of the story to him as well. The enemies in this book also seem to be lacking in their threatability. If you follow D&D I'd give them a CR of 12 max, which in no way challanges our heros who probably rate about 15. The one thing in this book that I enjoyed, beside including Drizzt back into the spotlight, was introducing more magic into the mix (spells, portions etc..)"
3,Subpar for Salvatore,"I have read all of Salvatore's books and this is definetely not his best work. He honestly seemed to be just ""rushing this to print"". His latest book ""The Thousand Orcs"" was much better and is more in line with his earlier Drizzt stories."
3,"Mildy entertaining, due to Drizzt and company.","With any other set of characters this book would have been much weaker. However, as I have read every Do'Urden book, I have an investment in the character that supersedes a predictable plot, and makes an average read better. While this does not compare well to the other Paths of Darkness novels due to lack of character development, it is still worth reading as an endcap to the first three books. If you don't expect the opposing individuals to be as interesting as Entreri, Jarlaxle, Rai-Guy and others, and the plot to be as engrossing as The Silent Blade or Servant of the Shard, you won't be disapointed. Overall, an average fantasy book from Salvatore is still a better book than most.P.S. If your interested in an exellent trilogy from the same author, try the first Demon Wars saga."
4,Not Complete...!,"It would seem Salvatore has done it again. Everyone is back in this snowy volume. Like the last Lethal Weapon movie though it made you feel like everyone was getting to old. Drizzt gets surprised by a giant, Wulfgar is getting hitched, even Bruenor doesn't seem like himself, and Cattiebrie seemed muted. Honestly a great book but i couldn't help but wonder why Salvatore wrote this one with the somber, winter, getting old theme. Made me feel a bit like I did after Empire Strikes Back came out. I'm already waiting on him to introduce a new ally and or bring back an old enemy if he did it in one book i would not be surprised."
3,"a good book, but . . .","how long has salvatore's readers awaited his return to his most popular character? he did not disapoint, packing the story with his classic fight sequences. however, if you have been reading this series, you will find this story lacks in comparison to some of the more recent books. while the story was by no means boring, it didn't seem to have the depth of the servant of the shard or spine of the world. all in all, a good book for a quick action filled read, just not his best."
3,A great book for the female fan but...,"Ok first of all let me clarify my worldview: I am a former Professional Warrior, the sweet memory of a recoil in his shoulder brings angst regret, my sympathy restss with the male fighter."
1,Terrible,It really would have been better had this novel not been written at all and we could strike it from the Drizzt series. The plot of the story is completely contrite and childish and you get more of the same old predictable Drizzt as we've had since The Silent Blade.
2,Ehh,"Not one of Salvatore's better novels. It's the final book for the Paths of Darkness series, and it ends nice predictable fashion. I enjoyed reading Servent of the Shard and Spine of the World, after finishing those books and then continuing with Sea of Swords, the series seems to end with a little thump instead of a bang. Pick it up if you're interested in following Drizzt and friends, but if you're looking for an interesting Salvatore book this isn't the one to get."
2,a disapointment,"First of all, I am a Dutch reader. This doesn' t mean anything to you but 1. English is not my native language 2. Every book I want to read I have to order abroad (e.g. at [Amazon.com]/expensive).Nevertheless I own every book Salvatore has written.This is by far the worst book he has written. The characters are flat, Wulfgar is at his annoying best, the story is two or maybe one-dimensional and I think Savatore made this story up while eating turkey at Thanksgivingday at his parents (boring) place.I rated this book two stars but I'm thinking it even deserves those two stars.Roger van den Heuvel"
3,Not his best,"Thank God, the Paths of Darkness series is over. The Legacy of the Drow and The Dark Elf Trilogy are the best books I have ever read! That being said...I dredged through this whole series cause it was so boring. I love Salvatore, but he needs to realize that Wulfgar is the most BORING character conceived! There is nothing there for the reader to be emotionally attached to him and actually care what happens to him. I couldn't wait to finish these books so I can start The Thousand Orcs. Trust me when I say that reading this series is not vital and really boring. The Servant of the Shard was a nice departure cause Artemis and Jarlaxle are awesome. But, three other books devoted to cry-baby Wulfgar and his boring character are enough to make me want to scream ""Tempus"" and toss Aegis-Fang at him and be through with his wallowing self-pity!"
5,Excellent,excellent story that closed out some long running stories with the heroes. continues to keep the characters engaging and the story fast paced.
5,A very good book,"I purchased this book for my son, who has read all the other books in the series. He found the author and story line just as good as the other books in the series. He has asked for the next book in the series while he is re-reading this book. If you have a son or daughter or a fiend who enjoys reading fantasy or fiction. I would suggest this series for them to read. It is a long series, but who does not wondering what happens to the characters at the end of any book. Some story lines grow old and others take on a new life. Don't know until you read and find out. This series has a nice story line that continues with becoming too old."
4,Strong & easy to use,"I was surprised by how light this item is, and still it remains strong enough to safely hold the flash.Needed to Dremel out the flash holder to accomdate some flashs. It's tight & touches the bottom sync connector. I also shortened the handle a bit for packing size."
3,photoflex,"Not bad for the price. A bit on the cheap side. Doesn't fit too firm on the lightstand and doesn't hold the strobe too well. IT's not a perfect fit. I was suggested to put an electric tape in between the strobe and the photoflex.For now, I bought another one for the cheap price."
1,Lever handle comes loose when the cap pops,"Photoflex Shoe Mount MulticlampWhile adjusting the handle (pull out then release wherever desired) the cap at the end of the lever popped out. Soon I have the lever (handle), spring & the cap in my hands. I have reassembled the lever parts for now, but I am not keen on using it. Thankfully spring was not wound tight, else the tiny cap would have been launched far away.The cap could be glued to the shaft (around which spring fits) carefully such that it would not block handle movement outward. Then again I did not buy this to repair it.I will stick withManfrotto 026 Swivel Umbrella Adapter (Lite-Tite).** Mar 2012. I had returned it with in allowable time for refund then; bought Manfrotto 026."
3,Fragile.. but works,"This is a much needed accessory for mounting speedlights to tripods with umbrellas. I've used this with both the Nikon SB-600 and SB-800 it held them both tightly but it still felt a bit flimsy to me.. Next the size of the ""multi clamp"" is bigger than I thought it would be.. Lastly and most importantly the reason I only gave it 3 stars is the metal cold shoe (as others reviewers have mentioned) But really Photoflex WTF? Why would anyone make a cold shoe out of metal? I recommend taking the cold shoe off and using the mounting foot that comes with your speedlight (it has a tripod socket on the underside of it, well atleast the Nikons do) if not then I highly recommend putting some electrical tape on the part where your flash contacts the coldshoe of the ""multiclamp"""
1,There's no reason to buy this given the price of decent metal ones.,"Threads on the umbrella knob stripped on mine too. 6 months total ownership, but I use my Manfrotto 026 most the time (maybe got a dozen uses out of this trash). Additionally, this one does not hold weight near as well as my Manfrotto 026; it sags with a 580ex and an umbrella if you lean it more than 45 degrees.There's absolutely no point in buying these when you can get a name brand metal adapter for a few bucks more (at the moment the 026 is $5 more). The metal ones lock and loosen smoother, sag less, and will last much longer. Don't waste your money on this crap."
5,It works,"Its a umbrella clamp, with a shoe mount. It works. There's not much else to say. Sturdy construction, holds the umbrella and flash well no complaints."
2,"Cheap, for a reason","I've had my multiclamp for about 6 months now, and I've become more and more jaded with each use.The construction feels cheap, and the shoe can't seem to keep my strobe attached. I have been tightening the screw to the point where I'm afraid it's too tight, and if it's not level, my strobe still feels like it's falling off. Recently the screw-head broke off, and now I'm searching everywhere to find a replacement. There must be a better way to get a solid feel when many of us are putting very expensive strobes on the clamp."
4,clamp types,"This is a good clamp for what it was designed.to hold an external shoe flash, and or umbrella,but it is not made to hold the photo reflector !They should not pair these up."
1,Unreliable,"It is dangerous to use this shoe mount clamp.First, my flash felt twice even though I tightened the screw.Second, the screw that comes with it had gotten loose and fallen several times, until it finally got lost. Then, I bought a replacement screw. Unfortunately, it cannot hold the flash tight enough either.Third, wrapping up the shoe mount and the flash with masking tape should not be an option. I tried this method and found it time consuming. Plus, it beats the purpose of using a reliable product.I rarely write reviews, but due the bad experience with this product, I promised to myself to say something about it."
5,Perfect,I have another one of these but this one is built better. More sturdy and it's also easy to figure out which way the umbrella's supposed to go. Thanks.
2,Cheap and plastic. Mine Broke.,"This umbrella bracket has an issue with where the umbrella hole is drilled: the hole is so close to the hinge joint that there is practically no material connecting the joint to the top piece. My light stand fell over once and the bracket snapped in two. Even some of the cheaper brackets with different designs may be more sturdy than this one.This works, but if you want something that will last go for an aluminum bracket."
1,0 stars,This product came today. The workmanship is shoddy and the batteries barely fit into it. It has ceased to work after a single use. I have tried different batteries. a True waste of money
2,Excellent Airplane Reading,"This is a great airplane book, or as has been categorized by several female friends: ""A little boy book!"" It is action packed and the pace keeps moving but... it is highly forgettable. In fact, I bought the book twice. I read a review of it when it was published in 1998. It got press because the author, Guy Johnson, is Maya Angelou's son. As a first novel, it had nothing else to recommend it. About four years later I picked up another copy because it looked interesting as I was going through an airport for an international flight. After reading the first chapter I thought that it sounded familiar. Of course, if you are a Clancy aficionado you know this feeling well! By the time I was half way through the second chapter I realized that I'd read this book before.Do not get this book unless you want to kill some time on a long flight or in a dentist's office."
3,A LIFE ALTERING COMPOSITION,"I GIVE THIS BOOK FIVE STARS! (not sure why the dang thing shows three) However, I am a HUGE fan of Guy Johnson. He is one of the big inspirations in my writing career; and his book ""Standing At The Scratch Line"" changed my life. I can't imagine becoming as great an author as he is, but thanks to him I'm always striving to become a better author, as well as a better man. Guy Johnson, you are a hidden jewel, and I wish that those of us who DESERVE to read your work could keep your brilliance all to ourselves. Furthermore,anyone who has given this work less than 5-stars needs to have their head checked. Congratulations, Mr. Johnson on a most incredible novel, and I so look forward to reading more."
4,A powerful new voice in black literature........,"I mainly picked up this book because it was written by the talented Maya Angelou's son. As the saying goes, the apple did not fall far from the tree. Guy Johnson definitely has his mothers gift of prose.LeRoi 'King' Tremain was one of the most realistic characters created in a novel. He had anger, strength of will, love of family, his own set of morals/rules and a strong sense of justice. From the time he was growing up to his days as a grandfather, there is always a sense of honor involved in his life. He will not stand for disrespect nor to be called the n-word. He battles enemy soldiers, the Klan, hoodlums, etc and always comes out on top. There is a sense of pathos in his life as well because of the search for his older son who was left at an orphanage by an enemy. And the wife who betrays his trust even after risking all to save his life. I sure hope Guy writes another novel with his larger than life creation."
4,Black Pulp Fiction,"I bought the hardcover book when it first appeared and I suggest you track it down just for its super-cool cover photos of black soldiers circa WWI.The book's writing is stilted and the characters are too one dimensional, but the tone of the book fits with the time its suppossed to be written in, so if you can live with those two things, this is indeed a RARE treat. A book about black characters written by a black person that treats the characters heroically one chapter and villanous the next.This is a solid adventure story wrapped in a war novella, wrapped further still in family drama. Whoever buys the film rights, please humanize the characters and reframe the story without the unneeded and implausible bloodlust."
4,"Great wire router but, the red is not red","Great wire router but, the red is not red, its a light purple'ish pink, or fuchsia according to my wife. I would suggest ordering black or silver if asked."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED/////// SAVE YOUR MONEY,THESE HEADLIGHTS ARE NO BRIGHTER THAN THE ONES I HAVE IN MY CAR FROM BJ'S FOR $12.00. I PUT ONE IN AND COMPARED AT NIGHT AGAINST WHITE GARAGE DOOR WITH THE ONE FROM BJ'S AND YOU CANNOT SEE A DIFFERENCE AND I HAD TWO OTHER PEOPLE LOOK AT THEM. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! THANK GOODNESS FOR THESE BEING CHEAPER ON AMAZON THEY ARE AS MUCH AS $50.00 AT OTHER STORES.
1,Product OK - Dealer Not So!,"I ordered the bulbs following the instructions, entering the year, make and model of my vehicle as requested. It then provided me with the item that was the proper one for my vehicle. I received the bulbs and took them to my auto mechanic to install. He informed me that they were not the proper type for my make/model and showed me how my original manufacturer installed headlights could not use the bulbs provided. I then filled out the request to return. I was surprised and extremely disappointed to find I would have $6.11 deducted from my refund because it was my fault! I followed the instructions and can assure you it was NOT my fault. My recommendation is to buy locally where you can return the item without being charged/penalized!"
1,Same as stock.,"Bought these for my wife's car in hopes that aftermarket bulbs had gotten better since the last time I used them. After all these years they are the same pieces of crap I remember putting in my rice mobiles when I was a teenager. No better than stock and burn out after 6 months, at most. Don't waste your money! Stick with stock or buy a car with ""factory HID""!"
1,Applications,I followed the application/specs given to me by Amazon. The number on the product was supposed to have fit my vehicle. It arrived and wasn't even close. Sent it back and went to auto parts store where they sold me the correct ones and at a cheaper price!
1,dont buy,"lights suck they are worse than the old one that they replcaed,not worth any money the worst lights i have ever seenthats all i have to say but i have to write so many words or this stupid reveiw window wont accept"
4,Just As Described,"These lights are pretty great. I noticed a huge difference right away after installing them. They are not completely white as you see with xenon kits and things, of course, so don't think you'll be getting a super white bulb when you buy - they will appear pretty much like regular lights, but much brighter. Also, not sure on the life of them as I've only had them for a few months. So far, well worth the money."
5,Great headlight upgrades,"I'm really impressed with these lights. They provide a much whiter and brighter light than our OEM lights. We are now running them in a 2000 Ford F250 and a 2004 Volvo XC70. Both vehicles had adequate lights to start, with stock halogen bulbs, but the SilverStar's made a really noticeable improvement. I don't understand the reviewers that didn't notice an improvement, maybe their lenses are shot, we certainly see a big improvement. Highly recommended."
4,Not Great but Improved over Regular Halogens,"Purchased this based on the raving reviews. It does produce a more pure white which has giving me greater visibility. I didn't see the vast improvement that reviews led me to believe, but I think that also may have to do with the crappy reflector housings on my car, but it is better. Would I say it's worth the price? Well that depends on how long they last. Reviews say up to a year. Based on my usage and also having DRL I give it about 6 months. If they last me at least that, I will likely buy again."
4,Decent,"These headlights look nice, and increase visibility as they say. If you're looking for a superbright bulb, these aren't what they seem to be. They have a pure-white look, which looks nice. Overall 4/5"
2,"Very bright, but not for very long.","I purchased these very expensive replacements because they were rated top in brightness and I was very pleased with the results. These bulbs were top notch... until my driver-side dim burned out in less than a year. I thought it might be a fluke, so I replaced it (even more expensive to purchase them singly) and was happy again for six months, then the passenger-side dim burned out. Now I am no longer pleased with these bulbs. I've purchased extra bright replacement headlights before for my other vehicles and they lasted years. This is the first time I've bought a bulb and discovered it's designed to burn out quickly. I don't know if it is poor engineering, or like household lights they are made to have a short life, but I will not buy any more and I definitely do NOT recommend these."
5,Silverstar bright,"I ordered two sets of the Silverstar lamps to replace the OEM lamps in my Murano and Durango. There was a significant difference in both cars with being able to ""see"" objects much more brightly. We live in a dense wildlife area. Missing critters is a necessity!Don't hesitate to get a set! They're not zenons......so don't expect jet-aircraft landing-light brightness!"
4,a little brighter,"I put this in my truck, they are somewhat brighter. if i had a new or cleaner headlight lens, i believe it would help with the brightness. before you buy make sure your headlight lens is up to task and you will truly benefit with the ultras"
5,headlights,we noticed the headlights on my wife's car were getting dim so replaced them with these. Very pleased with them.
4,Instant Brightness,I replaced both of the lights on my 1999 Mercury Villager ( a/k/a Nissan Quest. ) The plastic outer covers arehazy and I couldn't find any replacement covers under $ 125 each.Results were excellent. These bulbs are a little brighter without ultra high wattage risk of cooking them intheir confined space. They DO NOT have the annoying blue cast which bugs & blinds oncoming drivers.Sylvania 9007SU BP SilverStar Ultra High Performance Halogen Headlight - Pack of 2
5,SilverStar Ultra High,Greatly improved lighting over the OEM bulbs. If you want better visibility driving at night these are a good deal for a reasonable price that just about anyone can install themselves.
5,Super bright,Brightest lights you can get without spending a lot more on a good set of hid lights. I have had these bulbs in all my vehicles and love them
4,Worked great in my 2012 Juke,"I replaced a few of the bulbs around the Juke with LED bulbs to give me a little better light, but was unsure of what to do for the headlights. They worked alright, I just wanted something a little better than stock without being the one that gets every other driver irritated at night. I found in one of the Juke forums that someone had recommended these, so thought I'd give them a shot.Install was quick and easy considering how obstructed the area behind both bulbs are, and they worked just fine. Brighter enough to be noticed from behind the wheel, but not so bad that it interferes with other drivers. Color is about the same, but I have a better field of view.For the price, it was an easy decision."
4,Good Price compared to Retail,"Good Price compared to Retail. I should have looked into the life of the bulb relative to lesser models of Sylvania. Although they are the best for light in a Halogen bulb, they have the shortest life according to Sylvania."
5,Love it.,These headlights are extreamlly bright and are 10 times better then my stock ones. They have a little bit of a blue tint to them to that improve the looks of you car too.
3,"Whiter, Brighter than Stock, Poor Life","I first installed these on my 2008 Mitsubishi Galant ES (DRLs use the low-beams) before a long road trip up to Maine back in August 2008. Here it is now February 2009 and one bulb died already. Since then I put about 10,000 miles on the car.They started out very bright and white at first and worked great on the dark back roads. Over the course of time, I noticed that they seemed to be getting dimmer and dimmer. I figured my lens was dirty so I would constantly clean it. It turns out that they were actually dimming.So I installed the OEM Sylvania bulb where the one SilverStar Ultra burnt out to find that it's actually brighter! The only downfall is that it's yellow. I will try to post a picture of the two lights in comparison to give you an idea.I probably would not buy these bulbs again but try the PIAA Xtreme White Plus. I might consider the standard SilverStars again as they lasted well over 3 years in my 2000 Saturn SL2."
3,New bulbs ok,"Sylvania 9007 SilverStar Replacement Bulb (Single)I bought these and a whole new set of headlights because mine were scratched from wear. I had gone with my mom at night with her new Tahoe and I was envious of how good her headlights worked. After getting the headlights in and the bulbs changed I can see at night better but not as good as the new Tahoe. Would I put that money into it again? Yes, it did help, are they as good as they advertise on tv? I didnt find that to be true."
4,Good Product,"Not just a whole lot of color temperature difference than OEM, but at 3100K that's getting close to all you can squeeze out of an incandecent bulb. They are slightly ""whiter"" than OEM bulbs and I have noticed they do seem to project wider, and maybe just a little farther than my stock bulbs in a '06 Nissan Frontier. If you don't want to upgrade your whole light assembly then I believe these are the best option at the present time."
2,Not much better,"I bought these lights because the stock lights in our Ford Taurus were not really that bright. Since most of the roads we drive at night have street lights few and far between we were looking for something better. I took a gamble on these. I bought two sets, one for the car and one for the van. After I put them in the car, I took a test drive. HHMmm....not much of a difference! These did not put up the performance that the box suggested and I do not recommend buying these in order to get ""better"" night visibility. I have since returned the second set that I originally purchased and will not be buying this type again."
3,BEWARE! May not fit a Ford E-series van.,"These headlight bulbs did not fit in my 04 Ford E250, even though Amazon's checker said it would. My van needed a whole headlight not just the bulb. Be sure to check your van before buying. I bought some Sylvania H6054ST instead."
5,Sylvania 9007SU,The item was delivered quickly and worked great. I have the added peripheral night vision I was seeking with this new bulb. I am very pleased.
3,Not much brighter than stock,"These are OK, I put them on my 03 Durango SUV, they are slightly brighter than the stock lights,just barely noticeable difference though. I don't think I would buy them again after they run out."
2,Very Short Lifespan :-(,"I tried these and were impressed with their bright white light output, but was extremely disappointed with the lifespan. I didn't make it a year with the first set, tried again, and one bulb didn't make it eight months. Living in a small town where overzealous cops pull you over for having lights out, I went back to Xtra-Vision bulbs that last much longer. If you look on the back of the box it clearly indicates that the more expensive brighter bulbs last half as long as some the less bright ones. It is hard to believe they cannot make bright white bulbs that last longer. Hopefully LED headlights will have the right performance and price soon."
2,the quality is not as it descibes in review chart in back of package,I thought when I buy this Bulb then I have the brightest lightbut it is notthe quality & performance rating as it describes in the back of package is different than what I have now
1,Terrible! Don't waste your money!,"I bought these cause I was tired of my dim old headlights. The brightness on these was excellent... but only for 6 months. They both died and within a week of each other. I went to parts store to complain, but apparently they only have a 3 month warranty. Convenient. The guy behind the counter said that his brother had the same problem... maybe has something do do with them burning so hot. I don't know about that, but I bought the cheap ones and they work fine."
2,Not what I expected,"From the reviews I expected a substantial improvement, but I can't tell the difference. And the ""longer life"" in the description is a lie, it says right on the box they won't last as long as normal bulbs."
2,High Performance Halogen Headlight,I bought these after watching the commercial but wasn't impressed by the amount of light from these headlights. I have a hard time seeing at night and thought this would make it much easier for me to drive with these halogen lights. I really saw no difference at all. Don't waste your money!
1,Disappointed in performance,"The headlights wash out in close proximity to the front of the car. Very difficult to see when driving in traffic, much worse when driving in traffic and raining -- very dim side illumination. When you're on a very dark road -- one without street lights and without traffic (i.e., country back road) -- the lights perform well and you can see in the distance. Otherwise, for city driving, I would not recommend. I drive a 2004 Chevy Cavalier. Took lights to my dealer to have them installed, so I know the beams were adjusted properly. Will return original headlights to my car as they provided much better illumination in all driving conditions. Too bad I can't return these for my money back."
2,dissappointed,"These are not any brighter than the 9 year old bulbs they replaced. Save your money, put in the stock replacements."
4,Wrong bulbs were sent,I recently bought these Sylvania 9007 headlight. I drive a 2006 Chrysler T&C; Van. The program said these would fit but they do not. They do fit my wifes Pathfinder so i'll keep them.Double check your auto on Sylvania web site first.
5,Sylvania Silverstar Ultra Headlight Bulbs,"This shipper works very fast and it took no time for them to get to my house. I was told about a week and got them within only 3 days. I bought two packs of 2 for 50 bucks! For those of you who don't shop at autoparts stores, one pair of these bulbs costs 50 buck! Great product and at an even greater price!"
4,Good but not as bright as I thought they would be.,"These fit my car perfectly so it very easy to put them in. I did notice an improvement in the brightness and range once I replaced my old bulbs. Saying that I do not know if the price justifies the purchase. If they only last for 18 months as some people on here are saying then I will probably not be buying them again. I think the thing that really helped was doing a headlight restore and not having a haze over the lenses anymore. If you are on the fence, buy a pair and try them. If you are not satisfied just do not buy them again. With the rebate they are not that expensive anyway."
4,Lots of light for a great price!,These are direct replacements and put out much more light the the other upgraded bulbs I tried. They still don't set the road on fire like I would like. But now when I forget to dim the high beams I get lots of response from on coming drivers. Got them quickly. Would do it again.
4,"Performance as expected, but hoped for more.",These Silverstar Ultras are great. I could tell a huge difference over the OEM bulbs that came with my 07 Ford Ranger. But I really had hoped for even my brightness. I had an 06 Honda Accord that had the very best headlights of any vehicle I have ever drove. I was hoping to match their brightness. But all in all I think it was a good purchase for the outcome.
5,Great product,Noticeably brighter and whiter than stock bulbs. Not sure there's that big of a difference over the regular SilverStar's but if they actually do last longer (as claimed) then it's worth it. I usually get about 6 months out of regular SilverStar's - we'll see how long these last.
3,Not really such a bright idea,I got these bulbs so I could see better on dark roads with a whiter light. It says 50% brighter and etc. I didn't notice a whole lot of difference and paid a lot more to switch over. Here is the kicker that did not display in the ad online. On the back it says because they burn brighter they last only about a year as compared to regular bulbs that last 8 to 10 years.
3,Maybe a 10% boost in my Chrysler T&C Minivan,1996 to 1999 Chrysler/Dodge minivan owners have to live with weak headlight configurations. The overburdened single bulb provides both high and low beams in a poorly designed mirror/housing lens.Over years the plastic lens fog/pit from road debris along with the OEM bulbs yellowing. Replacing the inexpensive (aftermarket +/-$40) lens housing is relatively easy for the DIYer. Coupled with these Sylvania bulbs and one approaches the original brightness of showroom fresh headlight brightness. But do not expect more.
2,Good product but not as far beam as expected.,When i saw these headlights on TV i decided to give them a try. The night that i got them i went for a night drive they were good but the problem is there only 30% brighter and were just awful in the rain. I have since switched to an HID kit and wow the kit is alot brighter whider and farther than the silverstaars imo. If you really want brighter whiter light then buy an HID kit it may be expensive but in the long run it lasts longer and is brighter and whiter. In other words get an HID kit.
2,Bad in rain,"Yes, they are whiter, but they are terrible in the rain. For some reason they just totally wash out. It's so bad you can't see the sides of the road. I had the next Silverstar version beneath these and while they are less white, the side-lighting and rain lighting is much better (plus cheaper). If you live in southwest USA, these will be fine."
2,"Bright, but burn out quickly",I have tried two pairs of these lights with my 2003 Tacoma. The lights are noticeably brighter than the stock bulbs they replaced. The problem is that they burn out quickly. As little as one month to as long as six months in my experience. In contrast my stock bulbs have lasted for several years. I am now back to stock light bulbs. If you buy these carry a spare bulb and be ready for frequent replacements. The money you will spend over a couple years would be much better spent upgrading to a HID lighting system.
4,Not quite a 5...,"I just installed these in my Taurus (which I felt always had crappy lights). What a world of difference! I can see further, clearer, and more to the sides over stock. HOWEVER, these bulbs don't last long - the reviews and package are correct.BUT... I drive through deer country and the cost of replacing these bulbs every 6 months is still better than an insurance claim in my opinion."
3,"nice, bright, dead","these are much brighter than stock, but only lasted a year on my car. both bulbs burned out within a couple of weeks of each other. oh well."
2,No brighter nor whiter as claimed,"I was using the Philips 9007 Nightguide halogen. I was pretty happy with it until I read that the Sylvania Silverstar was the brightest and whitest of any halogen available in the market. After installing it, it was defintely no brighter nor whiter than the Philips. And Philips is way much cheaper too."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!!,I bought these not even a year ago and one of them have already gone out. They honestly didn't even make a difference compared to the factory bulbs that were already installed. Save your money or spend a little extra on something that will last.
2,Not much improvement,"My wife complained of her '96 Plymouth Grand Voyager headlights being weak and she was certainly right about that. So, after reading the reviews here, I bought the SilverStars. My main concern was the life span so I kept the receipt. But after installing, I really saw only a very minor improvement in brightness. Very disappointing."
3,Mediocre,"I don't see these bulbs producing as much light as it makes you think it does on the back of the package. However, in a world where people are not properly aiming their new lights (aimed straight instead of down at the road - yes you can aim your lights, it is in your headlight housing) and using HID lights to blind other drivers, I might be saying they aren't as good as advertised because I am comparing it to those people. Still, I think next time I will just opt for the regular bulbs or find a shop to upgrade to HID lights so I can also play the blind other drivers game."
3,Won't work on my stroller,"I bought this and would like it except it won't work on my stroller (Kolcraft Contours Double). The 3rd stabilization bar that is absolutely important for the standing position, will not attach because the distance is too great and wouldn't sit parallel to the ground if I could get it on. The seat is about 3-4 inches too high for my daughter's head to keep from hitting the parent tray. It's a bit of a pain to attach, but not impossible and doesn't require tools. This would be best on a stroller with 2 handles instead of a bar handrest."
1,Waste of money,"This does not attach well to my Graco stroller. I paid $100 for it, was ignored by the seller when I tried to return it, and now I'm stuck with a product I can't use."
4,wrong mount,"Unfortunately the photo on the page shows a shoe mount, but I overlooked the actual mounting type and purchased it. Since it was wrong I had to return it for a partial refund. I was purchasing this to replace a Sunpak flash I've had for years. It was an excellent product but gravity got the best of it one day."
1,Wrong Mount! Please Update Photo Image,"I ordered this flash as a replacement. I had the same Sunpack Auto Thyristor 355 AF flash for years, but cracked part of the mount. I received the flash today, but I received a flash with a Hot Shoe Mount. They should add Hot Shoe Mount in the title and the main description. Needless to say it does not fit my camera. A regular shoe mount is displayed in the image. I have provided feedback to Amazon to update the image. Now I have to search for another flash. (I have been very pleased with my older Sunpack flash)FYI - The shoe mount version will fit a Cannon Powershot S5IS"
5,works great,I used this adapter to reduce from my garden hose to 1/4 inch tubing for a drip irrigation system and it worked perfectly. Easy to use no leaks and good quality
2,Not impressed.,"I bought this item before going back to college as a non-traditional student. I went through it and found many scholarships that would apply to myself, and was very excited. However, when I went to the actual webpage, I found that all the scholarships listed were old and outdated or no longer actively given out to students. In my opinion, a waste of money. I did my own internet searches and found many active, applicable scholarships instead of using this listing."
5,A Very Good Book!,"Though geared for classroom use, it still could be adapted for the homeschool environment.It starts with 2 sample daily schedules that you could use as a guide.Then it actually gives you a calendar for the whole year, unlike most books that don't give a schedule for summer. Each week in the month is assigned a theme with suggested letters and numbers to cover. Then each week is further divided into days that are assigned activities you could stretch further by using the sample daily schedule (given in the beginning of the book). To top it all, it gives reproducibles and suggestions when to use these reproducible crafts during the week. It also specifies their page numbers. If you are a non-proffessional like me, these book will work like a charm! No wasting time waiting for your children to sleep before surfing the internet for crafts."
5,Nothing like it,"There is nothing like this DVD that can be found anywhere. The dancers are just outstanding. The performances are so captivating that you wish there was more, even though there is plenty on each side of the DVD - 90 minutes each. Most of the video uses two cameras and there are no special effects to take away from the great dancers. Very enjoyable video and it can be watched over and over again."
2,Disapointed,"I bought this DVD expecting exiting visuals, unfortunately I found the production value to be very poor. While there are individual performances that are noteworthy, the amateur camera work and the low video quality make it frustrating to watch. This DVD is most definitely overpriced and not worth paying the $79+tax & shipping for an amateur DVD production. I would pay around $5.00 for this. I was so disappointed by my purchase that I felt compelled to advise others of my experience."
2,A Disappointment,"I loved the earlier 2002 DVD, but this version (2004)was uninspiring. Fabian Salas (who produced this DVD) opens the show. He's changed his tango style. This time he stands still a lot, while his partner tries to make him look good. Other performances are dull; performers who were wonderful in the 2002 DVD were a disappointment in this DVD. I suggest buying the 2002 version. This DVD is not worth the price!"
5,Funny,"Product arrived fast. If you like his roles in the movies he plays, you like like his stand up."
1,Alice Cooper meets a Cockney Chimney Sweep,"The desperation that people go through to be famous. Russell Brand's stupid costume, hair and bad makeup render him an uncomfortable eye sore but contribute nothing to his utter lack of talent and humor. He's loud, rude, pushy and hyper but funny? Nope.He is also extremely difficult to understand. His accent - whatever it is - is grating on the ears. He's just a creep. Not different and exciting, just creepy and UNFUNNY. Just because someone is loud, rude and an addict does NOT mean they are talented. Don't ever forget it.RUSSELL BRAND ES MUY EL STINKO."
3,Russell Brand Live,I think Russell Brand is a very funny guy but was a little dissappointed that this wasn't much funnier than it was. I do give it 3 stars though....it was just ok. I would recommend renting this one and not purchasing it.
3,It is okay,Hammond isn't the same without the rest of the Top Gear crew. At least he tried out some interesting things while he was travelling the US.
1,Burning plastic smell,"I bought it even I saw someone's comment about the burning plastic smell. I regretted my decision at the moment I turned it on. It is not generating warmth at the first place. Second, that smell is really really bad. They should stop making this product!!"
1,bad heater,"I ordered car heater and it didn't work blew out the fuss in my car and didn't threw no heat out very bad product , would never order it again."
2,koolatron auto heater,This is an ok product. It doesnt heat up as much as I thought it would. and the lighter plug get hot pretty quickly.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,The silver connecter that is on the cigerette plug in pushes in and will not connect. the cord is VERY THIN and does not put out much heat at all and broke the second time I used it. would not ever blow hard enough to defrost a window. Piece of Junk
3,Works as claimed,"Like others have noted, if the heat in your car doesn't work this will not make up for it. It will, however, keep the fog off wherever it is pointed. J. C. Whitney has these for $10"
1,portable car heater,"Do not bother with this product. It arrived in time and in perfect shape but it gives no more heat than a 150 watt lightbulb. The cigarette lighter adapter got so hot, I burned my hand unplugging it."
1,does not work,we used it twice with little heat and them it stop working all together we may have used it 15 minutes each time so it has a life span of 30 minutes judge for your self to me its not worth the price
3,Could Have Been Better,"Great story, heroic people, tragic ending. Unfortunately, this great story was very hard to read for a number of reasons. First of all, I counted over a dozen typographical errors. Whomever edited this book did a very poor job. Secondly, the author mentions too many people. He would have made the book much easier to follow had he only focused on the main characters, and some minor ones. Instead, I found myself trying to figure out who half of the people mentioned were. It's almost like I needed a score card. Finally, the sub headings in each chapter destroyed the flow of the story and, in my opinion, were not necessary. The author obviously did a great deal of research and I commend him for this. I just feel that the book could have been a bit more user friendly. However, I would still recommend it to anyone interested in WWII."
3,Lost One!!,I had these on my car for a month and I lost one driving from OH to KY! :( They look awesome but mine wouldn't stay and rubbed my trunk on my Mustang.
4,small orbital sander,"In the Canadian Woodworking magazine (Aug/Sep 08) it states this sander ""is one of the few air sanders that can be operated on a portable air compressor"" this is NOT true. This sander works less than one minute with a portable air compressor. I discovered later in the Woodcraft October Catalog that they note the sander requires a minimum of a 60 gallon capacity compressor or equiivalent to operate. I am sorry I bought this sander."
1,"Built well, but poor performance",This thing does not perform well at all! It spins well until you put against something and then it stops with very little pressure. I am running it with a large compressor (6 HP 30 gallon tank)with proper pressure and volume. It is almost useless. I wish I would have just bought a small angle die grinder instead. Don't waste your money on this tool!
1,100 Assorted Sweet Pops....Not So Assorted!!!!!!,"I bought these assorted pops so that I could experience the flavors of childhood....all SIX flavors advertised on the box. What I wound up with was unbelievable. Here is the breakdown of all the pops I received in this assorted box:Grape=58Cherry=40Watermelon=1Blue Raspberry (my favorite and reason for buying)=1Orange=0Strawberry=0I was so disappointed. If you really want an assortment, or you are trying to have a decent number of your favorite flavors that aren't sold alone, you will be disappointed too. I attached a photo above of all the varieties separated to show how unbalanced the assortment really is."
2,Charms Broke Again!!!!!,I Love Charms.....But every time i buy them from this company they are broke. I always get the sweet and sour but I got the sweet and they were also broke so then i order the sweet and sour and again they were broke as of now there in my closet. When they are broke they cut the inside of your mouth.I have decided not to buy and more to pay to send them back is just a waist of money.
2,If you like your lollipops unbroken don't get this!,I was really looking forward to getting my lollipops but such was my shock when I received this item today.Most of them were broken I could barely rescue any. I'm so disappointed I won't be ordering from this company again :(This is what I got=43=Cherry15=Strawberry6=Watermelon15=grape12=blue10=Orange
4,Good thing I liek watermelon,"50 watermelon, 7 grape, 12 cherry, 1 orange, 9 strawberry, and 21 blue razz : total 100. Watermelon is great so I'll rate 4 of 5 but not a great mix for Halloween (would like more grape and orange colors). They are very sweet, great treat!"
4,slightly disappointed,"was disappointed at the selection of flavors (majority cherry) and some broken pops. This is not to say I wouldn't buy again, just that the assortment was uneven. still delicious."
4,"good, but not so assorted","Assorted means mostly cherry. (probably like 60-65). Next is strawberry (15-20). Then grape (10). Then blue rasberry(6-8). If you like orange, you'll be GREATLY disappointed. I had 2 in my box. Just 2! Breakage was about 20-25 pops. Luckily, they were mostly the cherry ones. Tastes great, like I remember as a kid. Will purchase again. Might just luck out & get 3 orange pops!"
1,Misleading Product,"I wanted to product to give to my girlfriend when she walks at night but when i received it and tested it I determined she would be better off yelling for help. First of all the alarm on both unit is not loud and the noise sounds like something that would resonate out of a child's toy. Second the ""Flashing Lights"" are extremely weak and I wouldn't even trust them on a bicycle. Overall, this product is grossly misleading and I do not recommend it."
2,not that loud,"i got these for my wife and they aren't that loud at all...plus, when she has that in her purse and walking out of a store, it always set off the store alarm!so they are just become a dust collector now."
3,alarm combo,"Both products nice, but alarm should be louder. If your truely lost out in the woods, it would take a long time for someone to hear it."
1,Not worthy of LTD,"The transcriptions are limited to on songs that Dexter composed which means some of his greatest improvisations got left out. Not all, but most of the solos are incomplete. One even omits the first solo chorus and picks up with the second. Very dissapointing."
2,Mediocre,"If you're inclined towards wooden and one-dimensional numerology, go for it. Otherwise, trust your own intuition. This was the first tarot book I bought, and I haven't looked at it since."
5,An exhaustive study of the Thoth deck..,"As a tarot reader of twenty years (I made a color video called ""Learning Tarot"" and wrote about tarot for New Woman Magazine) and teacher of tarot at Santa Fe Community College for nearly seven years, I can vouch for this book's authenticity. Each card is meticulously reviewed, with excellent attention paid to the symbols. She pulls together the astrology and numerology as well...so important for the tarot novice to understand. This is, in fact, a favorite book among my students and clients."
3,Black and white illustrations,This book have very much useful informations but with black&white illustrations. I think it is very bad for reading card symbolism.
2,The interpretation is not helpful for a beginner.,"After decided to shift from Rider-Waite Deck, I bought Thoth Deck along with this book. I find the section where an author explores each detail of the card very useful. However, the interpretation section is not helpful for a beginner like me at all. The author look into the meaning of each card more than just fortune telling but a way of life and self-discovery. The book doesn't provide an information I'm looking for. I couldn't fully use my Thoth deck until now."
3,I use this book as the textbook for my advanced Tarot class.,Excellent source of information. The appendixes are useful tools for study and interpretation of complex spreads.
4,Excellant source for the Tarot.,"I found this book very informative about the Tarot and its symbolisms. I most liked the information about one's growth path through life coinciding with the spiritual path. Lets you plot your past, present and future and see why things have happened and what might happen. Wonderful to calculate for yourself and friends and family too."
3,What happened to the colored cards?,"I was very disappointed to receive my copy of this book .......I bought it for the colored illustrations that a friend had. Apparently, the newer version (1997) printed the cards in black and white."
4,Great Deal for the Price,"What can I say about this besides that it's a standard SVGA cable? Sure the quality isn't of top notch, but do you really need to spend more on a cable that stays connected in the same place for 99% of the time?A 10ft cord is really all I needed, anything longer would have just been overkill. That's all I've got for this, it's a standard SVGA cable, nuff said."
5,Great Product,"This cable works great. It was heavier duty than I anticipated, meant for serious work. No problems; looks good; works well. I would buy from this Seller again."
4,works,"The cable works like it is supposed to, but it is a standard, bulky old-style thing. When I use this cable with my laptop, the wide connector blocks one of my USB ports. So I use HDMI when I can."
5,Easy as Pie,"I used this cable to connect my pc to a 26"" Samsung LCD tv/monitor. It took only seconds to connect and works great. I didn't have to make any adjustments and the resolution is very good. It was also very reasonably priced."
5,"Cheap, but it works.",This cable was incredibly cheap for it's length (try shopping for VGA cables at a retail store sometime...) but it works and gets the job done. I haven't noticed any issues to this point.
1,Cable didn't work!,"Beware:First, the cable did not work.Second, if you just want your money back HDE will not refund shipping costs; even if the cord is faulty.The cord a little thicker than others and is much more stiff. Definitely not the best vga cable if you're connecting to a laptop. It doesn't give you much slack.I ended up purchasing the 15' with 3.5 audio cord here on Amazon. The difference is night and day with the two cords. Pretty much the same price too!"
2,Supports a low resolution,"Did not know when I purchased the cable that it would only support a low resolution. For one function (my 2009 Acer 22"" monitor) this rendered the cable useless, but connected to my 8-year-old TV it (fortunately) has worked fine (matched in max resolution). I'd get a higher quality one if I bought again."
1,Not good any more!,Not works at all with my windows vista or windows 7 P.C.Supplier offered only replacement.Get ready to loose shipping fee for a brand new non working cable!
1,Didn't receive,Just that. I never got it. I used the same address with a few other Amazon shipments and this one didn't arrive.
5,cable,10FT SVGA Monitor Cable HD15M/M Coax & Twisted Pair Dbl Shldarrived in good working order in a timeley mannor.
5,Product is good.,Good product but not very good. Seller is good. Not a crystal clear HD vedio what I have seen at Sam's Club.
3,a pin is missing,Pin 9 is missing on both ends. It doesn't effect the visual quality coz it i s a pin for +5V power supply.
1,Totally Defective missing a pin,"Ordered two of these cables- they are missing one of the pins and will not work on my new computer. It's not worth it to ship them back,(and I paid for expedited shipping). Oh well we live and learn. Check before you buy!!"
2,You get what you pay for!,"If you just want a longer cable and don't care about picture quality, this is your cable. Otherwise, just spend a little more money."
2,Missing Pin,One pin is either missing or not properly placed in the connector. Only one ferrite is present. Cable functions but images have shadows/ghosts.
5,Using your TV as a monitor,"The cable connects a TV to a PC, either laptop or desktop.The procedure for attaching is quite simple and the cable performscorrectly."
5,10 ft pro series hd15 m/m svga,IM USING THE CABLE TO CONNECT MY PC TO MY SAMSUNG LCD TV AND ITS WORK GREAT. I WISH A BOUGHT THE ONES WITH AUDIO
1,Worked for 1 hour.,"The cable arrived on time and was cheap. The picture looked great for about an hour. After turning the computer back on again for a second go around, I received no picture. I swapped it out with a different VGA and the picture was working again.Conclusion: Apparently this cable is working for other people. I must be unlucky. I ordered another one from a different amazon seller and I am waiting to try again."
1,Simply doesn't work,"Well, I ordered two. Both charged at 20% the normal rate. Both fell apart within the first week. So where does that leave us? Don't buy."
4,Seems good,"Cable seems like it is heavy duty, but unsure of the connection ends. The metal surround is loose on one side allowing it to pull away from the connector. Once everything is screwed in tight, there is no problem, but I would like a more solid construction."
1,"Looks like quality, barely works.","Bought the cable to replace a 6' cable going from my computer to my 1080p TV. With this cable, my Windows 7 computer does not recognize my Sony TV or my HP monitor. Couldn't get the 1920x1080 my TV supports or the 1920x1200 my 24"" monitor supports. Both my TV and Monitor are recognized fine with the 6' cable that I already had. Throwing this cable in the trash."
1,Thought my monitor was bad. Turned out it's this cable.,"My LCD monitor (1440x900 res) was showing bad artifacts. Ghosting, blur, that kind of thing. I thought the monitor was going bad and I started shopping for a new one. Then just for kicks I swapped the cable (which is this one here) with a different one, and voila, the image is fine.You get what you pay for, I guess."
1,did not work,"Bought this cable to connect my laptop to my tv...didn't work. I even tried to use it on my desk top to verify if it worked or not. No luck. Didn't pay enough for dealing with returning it but buyer beware. Don't bother, pay a bit more to make sure it works for you."
1,"Doesn't work,defective, useless garbage from Vendor HDE","Cables To Go - 28012 - 10ft Pro Series HD15 M/M SVGA Monitor Cable with Ferrites (Black)Doesn't work,defective,useless garbage from Vendor HDE. I hook this cable from my HP laptop to my Sony VIZIO 1080p HD TV, it doesn't even display any image. Also, I noticed that although the photo falsely advertises a cable shielded at both ends, the actual cable has a ferrite shield at only one end. This is a cheap cable, and it's very cheap quality. Don't waste your money. MISLEADING DESCRIPTION. NOT AS DESCRIBED. The picture shows what appears to be a reasonably well made item. What I got was junk."
1,Poor picture quality.,"I used this to extend the reach of my monitor and got blurred text. I am using a DVI-I to VGA adapter from my video card and connecting to an LCD monitor with VGA and DVI inputs, so it's possible that this cable would work fine when connected directly to a native VGA out card (which pretty much no modern high end video card has). But I know it's not the adapter itself because it works fine with my old cable. The cable is fairly thick and has only one ferrite bead (as opposed to the two shown in the picture and implied by the description). I don't think the lack of a 2nd ferrite bead is really an issue though.Basically, might work when not using an adapter of any kind. But I got blurry text like a few of the other reviewers. Get something better."
2,Bad Cable - Bad Color,"I've used this cable to connect my laptop to a number of different HD TVs. In each case, the color was off and the picture was dark. I've used other cables in the past with the same laptop and TVs and did not have that problem.I will be buying a different cable."
1,Deceptive Description & Deceptive Photo Of Item,"The Item sent was not as Pictured, The description says Ferrites (PLURAL) The cable sent has only 1. Though I have never seen a ferrite that small before. The package it came in was an in house heat sealed plastic bag, with a paper sticker on it with the correct item # on it. The display on the monitor has a yellow hue to it that cannot be removed ever with gamma and color adjustments on the monitor and in software.I know the problem si not with the monitor, because I have 2 other computers connected to it and the display is perfect. it is not the computer that I have the cable connected to because, the cable that I originally had connected to it was fine. I am using that cable on another computer. That is why I bought this cable."
1,Fuzzy Wuzzy was a cable?,"Windows 7 would not automatically detect the optimal resolution. So I set the resolution manually, and tried adjusting the settings on the monitor, but the picture remained blurry. Put the old cable back and the picture was a clear as day. 8 years working in IT and I have never seen a 10' VGA cable with this bad of picture quality."
2,Gambled and lost,"Needed an extra monitor cable, saw this one was cheap and took a chance. The cable arrived in a very timely manner. Unfortunately, I lost my gamble because it did not work. Since it was so cheap I decided not to hassle with a return and let it go. I got one at Fry's for about the same price and that worked fine. I do not blame the dealer because I had not even given them a chance to make it right."
1,Fuzzy...,"Much like other reviewers, my LCD display became fuzzy because of this cable. Switched back to the old cable and problem was solved. I am returning these cables."
3,No hi-res support,"Mediocre cable fine for VGA only. Very poorly displays resolutions over 1200 x anything. Might be ok for PC to TV, but not for PC monitors located away from cases."
1,Well built but doesn't work,"I purchased this cable to extend the reach of my desktop monitor (1280x1024). The cable comes in a shrink-wrap package. It is made of a fairly heavy-duty material and has gold-plated or brass pins on both connectors. There is a ferrite on one end.Unfortunately, when I connected the monitor to my computer, there was no video. I contacted the seller, and they sent me a replacement cable at no cost. I plugged this one in and, still, no video. Again, I contacted the seller, who told me that this cable was ""incompatible with some systems."" They offered a full refund including shipping.I am not sure what systems or resolutions this cable will work with, but I suspect there are some non-connected pins. I do not recommend purchasing this item. That said, I am impressed with the vender, so I would feel comfortable looking for other products."
4,Good Deal,"Had been looking for a longer cable to connect my monitor a bit further from tower. The issue I have is it does not reconize my monitor and there for is not giving me a wide screen view on it. I had to jack around with some things to get it to go wide screen, yet I can use other cables and it goes that way automatically and sees it as what it is not just genric monitor. But for price and such it was still worth it to me."
2,Major screen flicker issues,I knew going in it wasn't going to be a high quality cable. I just needed something cheap that works for my dual monitor setup. Upon arrival It appeared solidly built but when using the cable there are some major screen flicker issues. Every 5 to 10 minutes the screen flickers to black and then back. Had to put it on my second monitor so it doesn't frustrate me as much.If you are going to be using it on your main monitor/Tv i would avoid this cable. I would return it but it is just cheaper to eat the ten bucks and go get something else and not waste any more money shipping it back.
4,Laptop savior,My laptop's screen had stopped working. Use the cable to plug up to my TV. Worked well!!
3,"First One Broken, Replacement OK","I wanted this cable to connect my laptop to an external monitor. I ordered the cable from HDE through Amazon. The cable did not work, all the ground pins were open. I contacted HDE through Amazon and they sent me a new cable. I didn't have to return the broken one. Five stars for HDE customer service. The second cable works fine although I was bit dissapointed that it only has a toroid at one connector rather than at both ends. Fortunately I do not have an interference problem."
5,Netbook to TV Connection,I now am able to watch downloaded movies from my Netbook to our big screen TV with a simple connection. Great product and supplier delivered on time.
2,Do not buy when hooking up a desktop to a monitor,Not sure weather it's the distance or the quality of the cable but when I relocated the desktop and used this cable the picture was awful. If it is indeed the distance then there's no reason this cable should even be sold because the picture is that annoying to look at. I'm now shopping for a new cable so just save yourself the trouble and buy a better cable right off the bat.
4,Works without any problems,"It's pretty long (at least it is for me). I use it for my 5+ year old Toshiba laptop to connect to the TV. Of course, for the sound, you would need to buy another wire for the sound. The cable itself works great. I haven't had any problems. The delivery came on time as well."
2,Disappointed,"I spent forever looking at reviews of VGA cables off Amazon to replace one that I had forgotten to bring with me (would've felt safer using monoprice for an analog cable, but I needed it quickly), and this seemed like the safest bet to be cheap and be a decent cable based on others' feedback. I ended up with just a cheap cable, shipped quickly. Using this cable for my 20"" monitor resulted in a blurry, somewhat distorted image. Just switched back to the cable I used to use (still VGA), and it looks much better. Maybe they're usually better and I got a lemon, but even still, that speaks towards their quality control.I would trust your analog needs with monoprice cables if you can afford to wait for them."
2,"Doesn't support 55"" resolution","I bought two of these cables. One did not work at all and had to be replaced. This cable will not support the 1920 x 1080 resolution from my laptop that is needed to fill the entire screen of my 55"" Sony tv. I have another VGA cable from a monitor I bought years ago that will support this resolution, so that cable translated my laptop screen to the tv screen. I thought all VGA cables would do the same but I guess I was wrong. Instead, this cable causes much of the tv screen to be unused. I'd buy a better cable."
1,"Poor quality, don't buy","These cable are no good. They don't have 2 ferrites as pictured, just one. They do not work with plug and play monitors, and there is significant ghosting. It would cost more to return them then they are worth."
5,Good replacement for std 6-foot cables,"I bought a new HPw2408h display and needed a few extra feet of cable. I tried a cheap extension cable which worked, sort of. The monitor worked, but the HP software to adjust settings didn't recognize it as a HP monitor. HP said the problem was with loss of signal thru the cable. Tried this cable and everything works perfectly. Would recommend this to anyone who needs something a little longer then the 6-foot cable that come with equipment."
4,Works great.,"Used this cable to connect my laptop to our new Samsung HD TV for a large screen slideshow. Required some fiddleing with TV and laptop settings, but it works great."
4,Cables to go vga cable 10ft for internet movies,I purchased this for a Lg tv hooked up to the internet for movies and youtube.Quality is better than i thought I recommend this to my friends.p.s. if tv doesnt recognized the pc input signal reconnect the existing monitor to the cpu and then disconnect the monitor while your in windows then reconnect the 10ft vga cable to the tv and pc it should work.Good luck.
1,Got an HDMI cable instead of this one.,I order this cable and what I get is an HDMI cable. Results in delays in my work and return-reorder hassles. Don't think I'll order with the same vendor.
1,buy or don't.. your choice,"Got it in the mail four days after placing the order and paying extra to have it expedited. Plugged it in to my laptop and a 47"" plasma TV, but the TV would not pick up the signal from the PC. So I went and plugged it into my 32"" lcd TV, and the text on the TV changed from ""No Signal"" to ""Invalid Format."" Then I plugged my desktop pc into my lcd TV and the picture showed for a few seconds in with only red, full color about 10 seconds later, then it went to gray scale. Within a minute the picture disappeared and my TV said ""Invalid Format.""It hasn't worked again, but because of all the 5-star reviews, I'm trying to get them to send me another one, but I'm not willing to pay shipping again after paying expedited shipping once already because they f---ed up."
1,Good for nothing,"Cable I received was an absolute bust. At first it wouldn't display colors properly on my monitor. After wiggling it around for a bit the color corrected itself, but then the computer couldn't detect the proper resolution of the screen. When using a Samsung cable, this was not an issue. Shipping costs more than the cable, so not even worth returning. Guess it's always a gamble when buying things this cheap."
1,WASTED MY MONEY!,What a waste of money. These cables cant even support the resolution of my monitor. What a waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY!!
2,Lower resolution,"I was only able to achieve a much lower resolution with this cable. Connecting my laptop to a new Vizio TV using my old three-foot cable worked great., The native resolution of my tv was recognized and I received 1920 X 1080. With this cable, my laptop was not able to recognize the TV/monitor and thus it only used a portion of the screen and was poor quality. I was not able to get the 1400X 900 that some others received but was limited to 800X 600 (or something close if that number doesn't make sense?) I spent a long time fiddling trying to make the cable work but no luck. Once I plugged in the old cable back came the high resolution. I do appreciate the low price and thus the low risk of taking a chance that it might work."
4,Good cable cheap price.,"Timely delivery, good quality monitor cable. Extending life for my Acer laptop, can now view higher resolution images and stream video to HD monitor."
2,Decent for the Price,"This product was a decent deal for the price, howeer there is not that great of connection. When I went to install this i found that several of the prongs were bent. Therefore I had to straighten everything out before it could be used. Would wait and buy one in the store"
5,Nice product A+,"This external HDD is very quick and is very quiet.Transfered 5-6gb movie files in a couple minutes.Good PriceFast, 2 mins for 4 GB file move - Quite, it's not really noisy as some people stated. - Nice Look! - Fan is nice, and I don't think the case gets hot easily. I keep it on 24/7.Very nice LED light in front."
1,HD Crashes all the time!,"The positive reviewers for this product are shills for Cavalry. Check all their reviews and see they just post good reviews for all Cavalry products. The Cavalry products are cheaply made, loud, and unreliable."
3,"sometimes is good, sometimes is bad","I've had various issues with this hard drive working with different USB ports, but currently it is working and doing its job."
3,good album from wilco bassist and sister,"I was pleasantly surprised by this little album. It's not really a show-stopper or something that changes your life, but overall, it's got a nice sound to it. I'm a huge fan of Wilco and always buy all of the side-project albums by all of the band members. And honestly, I wasn't expecting this one to be as good as it is. But if your into folky sounding acoustic music, then you might really enjoy this album. It's the kind of album that seems just okay at first, but then grows on you later. I'll be excited to hear Laurie and John make any more albums. They have lots of potential together."
4,Paranoid Ramblings Regarding Itunes Reviews,"Below you will find Astonishing ramblings by certified Deaf person who clearly has made alot more money than Sparks! I'm glad he wasn't able to return his iTunes purchase. Now he has made at least a financial donation to Sparks if not an Expert Audio Critical Donation towards this astonishing album.Perhaps some people should look wider for 'Unbiased' opinions of this CD.Such as those on Metacritic by Play Louder, Uncut, N.M.E. , SPIN, MOJO, etc."
5,Best Surprise of 2006,"Being a complete Sparks novice, I purchased HYL on the strength of ""Perfume"" which I heard on an independent radio station. When I received the album I was completely blown away. This record breaks convention by melding synth, pop, and classical in an in-your-face melancholy poingnancy rivaled only by select Pet Shop Boys tracks. Each track is a pleasant surprise unfolding with repeated listenting. The music in HYL has an operatic grandiosity which does not feel pompous, but instead feels somehow ""right"" and challenges the listen to stretch their musical horizons. Congrats to the Mael brothers on a fantastic, inovative release over 30 years into their career."
3,"Good Book, but in Need of a Major Update","This was the first book I read on technical writing in '95 or so, and, at the time, it was a good resource (and still is, in some ways).However, it's been eight years and a lot of things have changed in the 'tech writing game:' online help, the web, computers, tools (word processors, graphics programs, etc.), so it is well past time for an update.If your library has a copy, go ahead and check it out ... but if you're looking for more up-to-date information, look elsewhere. ""Making Money in Technical Writing"" is good, as is ""Write Your Way to Riches: How to Make a Fortune as a Technical Writer."""
2,It does not look like the photo on the Lastolite site.,I received the Lastolite today and was I disappointed. It does not look like the authentic lastolite Ezybalance card. It has White trimming 1/2 wide going all the way around the gray and white area with in the black outer ring reducing the size of the gray and white area not to mention the a patent tag is on the same side of the gray area which is also annoying and interfering. I have to say this has to be a knock off. I am not sure what other customers have received but this one is not what I see in the photo here or on the lastolite site. I am contemplating sending it back The only reason I would not is because of the low cost. I would not recommend purchasing this item from here.
3,"Too much for personnal use, might be good for a Pro","I bought this item quickly without looking for an alternative. I wish I would have been more patient and just made my own gray card since this thing will never have to travel outside the house, and a gray card can be easily settled in photoshop. The item would be great for extensive usage, hence for a pro that needs handy equipment on the road.Outside of that, the product is OK. I get the feeling that listoline produce a lot of those item and some might not pass quality control. I feel like I received an item that would not have passed quality control since the graph is not centered and the sewing job doesn't compare to professional standard."
3,it works but,"Yes it works, but this is the catch, you have to place this grey card under the lighting for which you are going to expose to get the proper white balance, also this small card has to fill the frame, this means:1. you need an assistant to hold it under the proper light.2. you need a telephoto that can cover the frame with this card from where you stand.or, you can just move into the light yourself holding camera in one hand and the card in the other with a wide lens.Any way too much hassle for me, I would buy the expo disc insteadExpoImaging ExpoDisc 77mm Digital Warm Balance Solution Filter for Digital Still & Video Cameras"
5,Good Value,"This item works extremley well. The size and the price is just right! It fits easily in our camera bags, This is a must have tool for proper camera exposure and achieving a accurate white balance."
4,Lastolite grey card/reflector,"Excellent product, a little bit pricy. The expandable/collapsible grey card works very well and appears to be made of good quality material. As a photographer I have found this product very useful and easy to pack along with my equipment."
5,Gets the job done,"I always have a problem with manually color balancing my photos so this is an excellent tool to help you get a good color temp. reading. You take your first photo with the card infront of the subject every time you're in a new location or the lighting changed and work from that either within your camera using the custom white balance option or in Photoshop when using Camera Raw. Very easy to use and carry around. I feel this is perfect size; not too big or small. When in it's little round case, fits right into my little Canon bag. Lastolite is a trusted company."
3,Works well enough,I debated between this and the disc that caps onto your lens and decided to go with this since it was significantly cheaper. It works but it tends to make the white balance on my nikon on the warm side. So I still have to correct it in post processing. I think if you are struggling with getting your white balance right then this would help a ton but if you are like me and you are already good at setting it without using anything extra then I'd recommend skipping this.
3,"Good Roundup, Difficult Interface","This book brings together a unique set of materials about a subject that is growing rapidly. But a lot of it was very hard to find and understand because of the jumbled layout and clashing colors - red headings, pink graphics, purple sidebars! If this were a webpage I would have clicked elsewhere."
3,My Students Hate This Book,"This book was probably a good first attempt at an eCommerce text book but now reads a little thin on deep explanations. My students (undergrad) universally hate this book. from what i gather, part of it is just the look and feel of the book - monochromatic and dull. it does not invite steady reading. the page of the book is slow and often cumbersome. i'm not meaning to knock the obvious hard work that has gone into this book but i just want possible instructors to be aware of its shortcomings in terms of students. Excellent as an insomnia cure."
5,Good set!,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he is very happy with it! I've enjoyed it with him!"
5,Westerns for Hubby,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves Gunsmoke and many other westerns. I couldn't buy them all but this was a good choice.
2,Volume 2 doesn't work,"I bought this for my stepfather for his birthday a few weeks ago and he was very happy. He worked his way through the first three disks (volume1) without a problem. Then when volume two started, the disks were unable to play. Disk one is corrupted and stops half way through the first episode and disk two doesn't even play. I put the latter in my PS2 to check if it was just the DVD player and I got a response ""No information on disk"".I don't want to give this product a completely poor rating as the other four disks work just fine. But Amazon really needs to check the integrity of their products before they ship them out."
3,"Oh, please--- why not do a season-by-season DVD release??","Look, I know ""Gunsmoke"" ran 20 years and filmed 636 or so episodes, but cant we still get a full season-by-season DVD in motion?This ""50th Anniversary Edition"" looks to be chock full of extras, and that's great, but it's another ""compilation"" collection, with just a few espisodes here and there from the series' run.And if we're lucky enought to GET a full seasonal DVD release on ""Gunsmoke"" (finally), will these same wonderful extras still be available on those??I am NOT excited about this middling tossed-together package--- no matter how many interviews and commentaries it has... Yes, I WANT those extras, but with a full episodic collection to go with them!"
1,"this is a great set ,but a huge injustice to fans of the show,GIVE US SEASON BY SEASON PACKS PLEASE!!!!!!!","i love this show and while i love all the extras that are here(the comantareys by the cast alone would get a five star rating any other time) this is not the way to release this groundbreaking and truly important series from our past!!!would they release only a few shows from each season of ""i love lucy"" , no because they know we would not stand for it and as painful as it is for me to say, i can't give this otherwise wonderful set a good rating,it's not how to release these great shows!!! PLEASE ,PLEASE, PLEASE GIVE US SEASON BY SEASON RELEASES OF GUNSMOKE!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Gunsmoke boxed set,I'm like so many of the other reviews I've read...I would like to purchase gunsmoke but I am waiting for the full season boxed sets to be released. I don't want a volume here and a volume there. I want to view it in release order. I don't understabd why Gunsmoke hasn't been offered yet in season boxed sets...unless it's more profitable this way.
2,Gunsmoke 50th Anniversary Edition,"I agree with everyone else who wants to know why Paramount won't release Gunsmoke in a season box set format. Also, the episode, ""P.S. Murray Christmas"" included in this 50th anniversay edition is a cut version like that shown on TV Land with 10 minutes of the actual show cut out. This set is maybe good for anyone who has never seen these epsiodes before but not nearly enough for a true Gunsmoke fan. The extras are nice but they certainly could have been included in a season box set. I am just not satisfied."
3,I agree with widowwalker,When is the season by season of Gunsmoke and Bonanza coming. Just about everything else has been released????
2,Gunsmoke - All Episodes Needed,"I, like a number of fans would prefer a full release of all episodes. This ""best of"" set just makes that more clear. For those not aware, Columbia House produced 20 DVD's (each with 6 episodes) covering all episodes 1955-1959 about a year ago. Just like watching the original shows on TV without commercials. Each episode had some extras like production notes and guest cast comments. I have not heard anything since about later years being worked on. They are a must for all fans. I'll keep waiting for more full seasons."
5,Excellent Service,I got my gunsmoke dvds in excellent condition and they arrived in a very good reasonable time.I have ordered several items from amazon.com and i'm very satisfied dealing with them. They are very great towards thier customers and they are very bussiness like.I have delt with others on line and they don't stand up to amazon.com. Thank you amazon.
5,Gunsmoke,I looked every where for Gunsmoke DVDs and found them at Amazon. My children love watching them. I prefer them watching Gunsmoke over what is on TV these days.
2,David V,"I like all of you loved this series and I for one refuse toto pay for a tease,however when they release seasonsI'll collect them all."
5,Long Live Gunsmoke,"I found the 50th Anniversary set of Gunsmoke to be absolutely delightful from the episodes to the incredible ""extras"" I was hooked from the first moment I put the first DVD in the drive.I would love to see more releases of this wonderful series. This was an incredible TV show, what other show lasted 20 years and even though it ended 30 years ago has a huge fan base? How many actors can say that 3 generations of women have been in love with the charactor they brought to life. Yep, Long Live Gunsmoke! For 50 years fans have been trying to figure out why Matt and Kitty never kissed! Sure would love to see more released, especially the early 1/2 black and white episodes."
4,FuN and FuNNy ...,"I just bought this game the other day and i thought it was gonna be ok, but once i started gettin into it, it was great. The graphics arent the best, but the gameplay is good. The funny sounds and the way they manuever themselves is great. Blowing the ... out of worms, is got to be the funnest thing i've played so far. And if ya got no friends dont worry, hook it up sega net and play people across the globe. for only [price]this game is must, if u and your friends like blowing up worms with bazookas, grenades, miniguns, flying sheep a various animals."
1,"Oh, why?","... On a 36"" TV, the worms are still microscopic. The graphics, ... The point is to fight opposing worms. All of the worms look exactly the same, cluttering the tiny workable area. Any vast attack will kill your own worms before the ones intended. I tried to like this game. I played it for hours. Then I took it back to the store, where the lady said, ""Not another one!"" This game should've never passed the cutting-room floor. 1 star for the graphics staying true to the Atari 2600 origional."
5,lux christi,Excellent recording of a little known Elgar Oratorio (apart from opening Meditation). It forms a trilogy with The Apostles and The Kingdom.A bit episodic compared to the later great works. All singers good.Chandos recording quality excellent. Orchestra great.
3,"Excellent book, but now woefully out-of-date","This is an excellent book, but, ten years later, it's now woefully out-of-date. It has a heavy emphasis on Solaris, whose use is in steep decline. Many of the technologies (SCSI, SBus) are obsolete. Other technologies (SSD, SATA, SAS) were not practicable at the time. There are still useful sections, but it's up to the reader to work out what parts are no longer applicable.Hopefully O'Reilly is working on a worthy successor."
4,Indispensable place to start,It is generic and only dated to the extent that there is more information now. The concepts and methods are still sound and can be applied to today's systems.Want to know about SAR?When you time an application do you want to know what the user-state CPU time and systemstate CPU time means?Many of the pertinent questions and answers to System Performance Tuning are in this book. The chapters are:* Introduction to System Performance* Monitoring System Activity* Managing the Workload* Memory Performance* Disk Performance Issues* Network Performance* Terminal Performance* Kernel Configuration* Appendix A Real-time Processes* Appendix B A Performance Tuning StrategyThis book has helped point to the pertinent manuals on several flavors of UNIX.
2,Good but outdated,"This material is extremely outdated. (Look at the pub. date)However, it teaches some good fundamental concepts that can be used by an experienced UNIX SysAdmin.There are plenty of recent books that cover material better."
5,It works,"This has a lot of the same songs on the standard chip that comes built-in to the magic sing mic. I was trying to find a chip with older songs that seniors would enjoy. This was the closest thing. I knew it wasn't perfect buying it but since all of the songs listed work, I can't complain."
4,Not bad for $40 bucks,I had my heart set on buying a Tivoli Model One. I was at Target contemplating purchasing one when I saw Target was clearing out this radio. It was only $40 bucks. So I caved in and picked this up. I am pleased with my purchase. It gets pretty loud without distorting. The tuner is rock solid and locks on to even faint stuff. Good sound quality. I like that it has a tone knob to flatten out all that bass on public radio.
2,"Pretty, nice sound ...","This radio looks good. The simple three knobs and sleek black box are well designed. I like the acrylic block on top that the clock shines through.When you can tune in a strong station the sound quality is smooth and full.Of course you realize that with one speaker it is monaural but that's OK. I bought this radio in hopes of listening to baseball games. I can pick up the AM station that carries the game clearly enough to be listenable, but I could get almost no FM stations without an external antenna. The ICF-M1000 has an external 75-ohm coaxial antenna connection.I wish that it had some sort of alarm function and I can't believe Sony didn't at least include an FM antenna wire in the package."
5,Works great.,I use the Sony ICF-M1000 in the kitchen. The digital tuner makes it easy to find the stations I want and reception is great.
4,good,Its a good radio for a small room. The only thing I am not happy with is the light on the clock stays on all the time.
1,Beware Beware,"Beware of items that do not come from Amazon. I bought this radio and the only problem is that the dial to select a station advances up no matter which way you turn it. Yep. If you are listening to 1010 and you want to go to 960 you have to dial all the way from 1010 up to the end, then to zero, then up to 960.No wonder its not expensive"
2,Sony Could Have Done Better,"I bought this radio because I thought it looked ""sleek"" and seeing it in a local store, I bought it from Amazon.Too bad I didn't listen to it first; Although it is easy to use, this radio lacks mid-range. It has a tone control, and while you can change from treble to bass, there doesn't seem to be any midrange that is clear to hear.Also, in hooking up my tape deck, the sound on ""aux in"" was not up to par.If you are looking for a nice, basic table radio that has straight-forward controls, I recommend the Tivoli instead.Sony could have done a better job with this one; I gave it to my nephew, who didn't care about the mid-range."
2,"Great design, weak function","Sony ICF-M1000 Table Top RadioThe cabinet design is four- or five-star superb. But unless you would like to hold the powercord antenna in a narrowly fixed position to get even alocal FM station, this radio would be essentially useless."
3,"Nice radio, good sound","Would have been nice to have preprogrammed channel buttons for favorites, but otherwise a good radio."
5,nice radio,"I specifically got this radio because it has excellant AM receiption and a stereo line output. If played through the speaker, the sound is very good. The casing decor also fits in with my home theater system"
4,Better than most.,"FM is great, AM is only fair, I had a Crane at twice the price that did a better job by quite a bit on AM. Can't we have a few presets? I've never counted how many times the tuner knob must rotate to go from one side of the dial to the other but it is a bunch. Rock solid tuner with great digital readout. If you only listen to one FM station, it can't be beat."
5,Sony ICF-M1000 GREAT!,This is a great radio. A great addition to any home or office. It is small and sleek looking. Sound is AMAZING.
5,A winner,I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to audio and I needed a decent radio for my office since my blankety-blank IT manager won't let us stream music anymore. This little Sony am/fm is a winner. Very contemporary design and great sound. Sony seems to always manufacture a great product for the best price. Such a concept!It's now 2013 and I'm adding to my 1st review -- the radio is still going strong. To bad they aren't making it anymore.
2,Search more before you use it on your children,"I see Valerie ann Worwood have this book for children.As i heard before my Reflexology teacher ,the Lavender is messing up children hormones.Be careful parents!!!Search more.I found also a link read about:[...]And also you can Search more about Lavender oil,related study."
5,Healing Power of Nature,"This book is an indispensable guide for every parent who thinks pro-actively about their children's long-term physical and mental health. Powerful, yet safe, aromatherapy is a sound way to treat everything from influenza to sunburn in children. Many complaints such as aches and coughs that might otherwise have to wait for a visit to the doctor can be addressed immediately at home, using the healing power of nature."
4,Great book great price,If you buy this book you will for sure get your monies worth. It is a great book for those of us who are a littel worried about making suggestion to parents for using aromatherapy on their children. If you are new to aromatherapy be sure to include this book in your library. It won't stay on the shelf long; you will read it many times over. Great book. Buy it you won't be sorry.
4,Helpful,"Unlike Worwoods other bookThe Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy: Over 600 Natural, Non-Toxic and Fragrant Recipes to Create Health - Beauty - a Safe Home Environment, the oils she suggests in this one are difficult to come by. I have used many of her suggestions for other modalities and have found them helpful."
4,Very helpful,"She adds a few more oils than she does in her other books, but this is definitely worthwhile. Expanded information specifically surrounding children. I've used it as a go to a few times now -- happy with this purchase."
4,Excellent short stories,"This book was one of the first short story books that I've read. It has some awesome stories in them. I enjoyed and loved them tremendously. Alice, you are truly a gifted writer. I enjoyed reading all your books."
1,Doubt I would buy it again,"I purchased and item, actually the next item I will review. Less than a month later it malfunctioned. I called the service contract people and got a run around. They told me to call the manufacturer. I called the manufacturer and got a song and a dance. A day later I called the manufacturer again and made sure that they understood that their item didn't work. They said they would replace it, but I haven't heard aword since. According to the people I spoke with who handle the replacement contract, it doesn't kick in until after the original warrantee expires in a couple years. Basically, it isn't worth the paper it is written on."
1,Replacement Plan,"This Item was purchased on Sept 25, 2008 and was notified 4 days later that in 10 to 14 days I would receive confirmation, it has been over a month and I still have not received any documents or confirmation."
5,"Just what we needed, good info and tips",Good precise information and plenty of tips for the walker whether in the South or North Island. Should be handy for our first trip to NZ.
2,Would you like some cheese with your whine?,"I had heard a lot of people talk about Bright Eyes and the emotional intensity present at their shows. I guess Conor Oberst cries at almost all of his live performances. I don't know why you would need to go see him cry when one can simply pop in this album and hear him cry and whine the entire time. I got so sick of his quivering voice singing about his paper thin suburban problems that I sold it back after one listen. I'm not one who believes that grown men can't cry, but if that's all they do, then I just can't take it. There is some good music on this, but I just think that Mr. Oberst needs to sack up and deal with his problems like a man."
1,It must be an acquired taste,"OK, I bought this based on the near-unanimous praise the album has received from almost every critic and publication I trust.I listened to it once, and I have no urge to ever listen to it again.Nothing attracted me, nothing ""hooked"" me.The lyrics are a kick to read though. I was actually quite impressed by those alone, but the melodies and instrumentation...the ""music""...left me with nothing. Zip. Nada.Actually, I think one of the worst things you could ever say about an album is that you'd never want to hear it again, don't you think? I was left with such apathy towards it..."
5,Skip over all other reviews,"Let me just start by saying that I think that Conor Oberst is a genius. I have not heard all of his work, but I do own Fevers & Mirrors and Lifted... I bought F&M and every time I put it in my cd player, I found a new song that I fell in love with. With Lifted, I fell in love with it on the first listen. Granted, some of the songs aren't as great as others, and there are some that I skip over, the ones that are good are good. Worth every penny if you ask me. His style is incredible. Amazing."
5,Good Stuff Kids,"I guess I can understand why people out there don't like this CD. When I first heard Bright Eyes I didn't like them at all, but after I got tired of hearing all the emo bands that sounded exactly the same I wanted something different. That's when I started liking Bright Eyes. The music is definetly a lot more complex I mean, who else has a clairent, french horn, vibraphone, basson, choir, etc on their Cds? No one that I know of...Anyway, if thats the sort of thing you're in to, then youll like Bright Eyes, but its just no for some people."
4,A Very Bright Future,"Well Conor Oberst certainly provokes extreme reactions ... ""Pretentious Nonsense"" or ""The New Bob Dylan"". Well to be honest after listening to the Lifted I belong in the latter camp. I live in London & so I avoided all the hype surrounding the album, here Bright Eyes receive no radio airplay or music magazine centrefolds. My opinion is my own. It is a little gem of an album. An intoxing combination of country/rock/punk. Yes, the songwriting is pretentious but in a charming Morrisey-type way. Now lets kill Dave Matthews."
3,Nice Try,"If the tuning weren't so painfully awful, I might consider listening to it again.I'm glad that musicians of my generation are trying to make significant, profound music, but honestly, Oberst isn't there yet. Definitely not vocally, not with his arrangments, and not even with his vague and somewhat cliche lyrics, which are so highly praised by other reviewers. I think moments of great potential shine through, but there are so many other truly amazing albums out there that I'm not willing to put up with the rest of the awfulness on this one to get to the few good moments.I do, however, look forward to future ""Bright Eyes"" projects."
2,Overrated Chump,"I just want to say this music is pretty horrible. There are only about 3 songs on here that I enjoy listening to, the others feel like a chore. The voice wavering is a nice gimick, but a little irritating at times. The song structures and progressions are pretty lame, too, and in my opinion, that's more important than the lyrics. If you want lyrics that seem nice and deep and meaningful, this is probably the kinda stuff you want to hear; but if you don't like listening to horrible music, try someone else."
2,Maybe I'm just not getting it,"I've definitly heard better.And I don't see what all the hype about ""Lover.."" is about. The song is not that great.Bright Eyes has excellent lyrics, I'll agree, but so does Tool. That doesn't make them a good band."
1,Over Indulgent and Annoying.,"This record is not artitisc, it is pretensious. Conner Oberst's lyrics are over-indulgent and annoying."
3,hmmmmm,"wow, i read these reviews and there are sure a lot of really intense conor-lovers and really intense conor-haters. hmmmm i say be nice to each other and accept every kind of music and don't be mean to people just based on if they feel emotionally connected to a certain type of music. anyway i think conor is really cute, so even if you don't like his music, give him a chance!!!"
5,Album of the Year,"The power of this album is amazing, particularly when you consider the simple fashion in which it was made (i.e. recorded at his house as well as a local studio in Nebraska). Poetic, stark, sweeping orchestrations, humor, passion....and really amazing melodies that no one seems to talk about.I rank this as album of the year along with Beck's SEA CHANGE."
5,The emo Sgt. Pepper's,"...or this year's Tusk (and I thought Wilco had sewed that up with Yankee Foxtrot Hotel!). The kid comes on like Dylan and isn't afraid to fling himself totally over the top, risking utter embarrassment and delivering the first truly essential album of 2002. Like Tusk (and even SPLHB, to a degree), it's a sprawling mess, but Conor's smarts (and smarting), those pop hooks and that wacky drum corps paradiddling away in the background assure that this is always fascinating even if it errs in being a bit too-too from time-to-time. He more than earns (and repays) every minute of your undivided attention, however, and how often does that happen these days?"
5,My taste is just fine.,"This album, as any of the Bright Eyes, is one that only those who ponder to think, or wish to write will like. To put it short, the words are so profoundly written that those listening without any depth, won't feel it. Don't buy it if your choice of music is Brittney Spears. Bright Eyes albums are meant to be indulged into as one would with a favorite book. Let them take you wherever you want them too."
5,The Best Indie Rock Album,"OK. If you haven't heard Bright Eyes, and you're into Indie Rock, buy this album today. This record is phenominal. Conor Oberst is a genius, not to mention quite a cutie. These songs are heartfelt, angsty, indie, just simply amazing. You can't go wrong with thie record. It's a masterpiece."
5,Great,"I bought this album at circuit city. It's great. I love it. Its prolly most played in my cd player. I listen to a lot of hardcore, emo, punkrock stuff. people may classify bright eyes as emo. but they are just indie kinda soft rock or w/e. i dont know. but they are a good band. Conor oberst has great lyrics. The song dont know when but the day will come is great. lover i dont have to love is good too. get this album."
4,Get used to it,"the first bright eyes cd i bought was fevers and mirrors and i absolutely loved it. the poetic lyrics, great acoustic and extra coll instraments. so i decided to buy their most recent album, which would be this. i got it and started listening to it and at first i got kind of bored with it. although their are some really great songs on it some songs are either weird, or just not that interesting. i hvae had the album for a few weeks now and have found myself listening to it more. so i guess you could say i got used to it. but if you want a great bright eyes cd get fevers and mirrors. 4 stars"
3,Lifted...then sinks.,"I discovered Bright Eyes from a mix tape my friend made for me of all his older recordings. Honestly, it took me about five times (play times per song) to adapt. Conor Oberst sings with a lot of stripped raw emotion. Unfortunately, you have to get past the singing flat part.He is definitely an acquired taste, and the very musical Lifted (which in comparison to other artists isn't that musical) is no exception.If you know Bright Eyes, then this CD carries content that you will be used to (moaning about love and death and sadness and getting drunk and stuff) but this time enhanced by some interesting orchestral intervals. If you are new to him and his work, try Fever and Mirrors first, it's a better representation of his work, and it's much more accessible."
5,The Best Album of 2002.,"Though I say unquestionably this was the best album/release of 2002, it is only in the running for the best album by the gifted artist known as ""Bright Eyes."" I am inclined to say that Lifted,Bright Eyes latest, is also his best effort to date. Proof that somehow he improved upon other brilliant lyrical successes such as Fevers and Mirrors and Letting off the Happiness. Lifted shows the there is still much more for Oberst to explore and grow into as this generation's most important and gifted artist.Oberst tackles tough issues, such as terrorism, american arrogance, history, vanity, the media, and the potential of war beautifully with a poetic sense not seen in music in decades. He sings as if he expects his listener to be just as smart as he is, which in an era of mono-syllibic stars one has to appreciate. Lifted is is a brilliant, wrenching album and not to be missed."
2,Dull eyes.,"This poppy, folky hodge podge of instrumentation and styles should be oddly cool, yet is just plain boring. Whiny, lazy vocals can't hide a dull voice which is what CONOR ORBST has. He writes good lyrics, and has no problem emoting, it's his songwriting that needs help. Long, quiet tunes make this a moody CD that has very few bright moments and on most tracks ORBST sounds like he's about to burst into tears, yet you don't feel at all sorry for him. He doesn't sound tortured, he sounds like a suburban shoegazer with a lot of equipment at his disposal. Mixed with a plethora of different bells and whistles (all kinds of horns and such), this is a big production that can't hide the fact that it's actually an egomaniacal collection of single feelings with a large back up band. Bo-ring."
4,This is ridiculous.,"Bright Eyes is a great band regardless of what people might say on this board. There are very few posts that actually discuss anything about the band. I see either ""Bright Eyes is too good for this world!!,"" or ""He's too whiny and you're all posers."" Shut the f up. Conor Oberst is great because he explores various routes of guitar, orchestra, and vocals; while at the same, he conveys his message of the urbanization and capitalist-takover that is creeping its way into his hometown of Omaha."
4,Bright Eyes makes me suicidal - - (in a good way. . .) LOL.,"This band is amazing. The sweet honesty of this kids words, the strange innocence with which he writes. It gives me chills, man, it gives me chills. I write music and constantly find myself beating myself up over the inability to write lyrics of this caliber. The imagery is amazing. The scenes are scenes from our own lives that this artist illustrates perfectly. Love, honesty, insecurity. . . it's all here. Some of the music is so wonderfully tragic that I just want to bury my head in my pillow and bawl - and then I will hear one of his ever-present witty observations and it brings the smile back. I love this album. I love this band. God, I can't believe I missed the Houston show. I am soooo disappointed.(no - I'm not suicidal. . . lol)"
1,Cruudy Record gives me hope of Stardom.,"Man, this record got great reviews from all of the heavies. I bought it without even checking out the sound bites. I could make a better record in my basement. The artist has talent and potential to make good music, but his attempt at being dark and creative impedes the listenability (is that a word?) of this disc.At one point someone screws up during the recording of a song. Conor just gives a quick 1,2,3,4 and they pick up the song where the error occurred."
1,Could Be The New Winner,"Yes folks - for several decades now the number one critically acclaimed yet totally unlistenable album was ""Trout Mask Replica"" by Captain Beefheart. It is great to see that there finally is a contender for that dubious throne. Bright Eye's ""Lifted"" is breathing the same rare air as the aforementioned ""Replica"" as the one that critics love, trendy wannabees rave about, and only those who do not let their opinions be swayed by others have the guts to admit the truth - that it is a total trainwreck.Interesting, but kind of in the same way as smelling a bad odor. Stop looking for the ""New Dylan."" If you want a young talented kid, try one who actualy makes music. Ben Kweller would be a good choice.On the other hand, the packaging is cool and it makes an excellent coaster."
2,FUNNY STUFF!!! VERY WHITE!,"This c.d. is hilarious! A dead on satire of all that is repugnant and horrifying in adolescent poetry and navel gazing. Its very difficult to listen to, but that's the idea and ultimately where its brilliance lies. It would be difficult for anyone else to make anything this completely awful or funny. A dynamite one, two punch! Plus the kid is hot and all the proceeds go to some charity for retarded kids."
2,ho-hum,"Do we really need another phony sad white kid singing to us about experiences he doesn't even understand? No.Yes, he knows words that other kids his age don't know. That is, indeed, impressive. But his depression never rings true. If he was as sad as he professes to be, he wouldn't be making this type of music.If you desire false, derivative melancholia, stick with Bright Eyes. ..."
1,"When I think of Bright Eyes, I want to gargle acid","Like many people I bought this cd because I read all the great reviews that said Conor Oberst was a brilliant lyricist and the musicianship was excellent. Much to my surprise, when I played this cd I was greeted with the whiniest, worst sounding, pretentious garbage I have heard in my life. I mean wow. I can listen to ""bowl of oranges""...but it's still a little tough. Whoever compared him to Springsteen or Dylan really should just quit their job and go live in the woods because you're a moron."
2,"On the whole, I was disappointed","I bought this record after hearing no music from Conor Oberst, and nothing about him except a comparison to Bob Dylan. In my opinion the comparison is inappropriate. Like Oberst, Dylan was a loquacious and sometimes vague lyricist, but Dylan also had an ear for a hook that Oberst does not seem to have. While the backing band is obviously capable, the music, like the lyrics, rambles. Without the clear and repetitive phrasing that typically ties a song together, many of the tracks on this record seem to go everywhere and nowhere at once; and rather than a Dylanesque genius, Oberst comes across as a ranting adolescent who doesn't know when to shut up. Oberst clearly has a way for words, but he has many things to learn about songwriting."
2,"I tried to like it, but I just couldn't","While the music is OK, the lyrics and vocal delivery make this completely unlistenable."
1,will? you? will? you will throw out bright eyes,"save your money. take your girlfriend out to dinner. kill what you loathe with a bottle of jack. love, learn, and listen to better music."
1,Reality check indeed!!!!,"I dug this CD up and am listening to it right now. I put it away several months ago in distaste, writing it off as another overrated contrived piece of folky emo-trash. So I picked it up again after hearing and reading about the incessant praise given to this....album. Don't get me wrong, I love to sit around the house and mope to the stylings of Jeff Magnum or Nick Drake or even Sparklehorse, but this is just ridiculous. The music wraps itself effectively around daddy Oberst's warbly, ""Robert Smith"" (for lack of a better comparison) vocals, but do you seriously believe this 23 year old from Omaha is as tortured as his lyrics pronounce? Again, I like intense personal music (older Palace Music, for instance), but this just feels artificial to me, like the typical cry for attention. Blah! This was written as a warning for those who stumble upon this band and read nothing but rave reviews, and think, hey why shell out the 17 bucks if everyone seems to like it? Be forewarned."
2,Not as good as everyone makes it out to be...,"Okay I seriously was expecting this record to be awesome..Rolling Stone gave it 4 stars, there were so many good reviews, and now I wish I listened to the bad ones! Okay I went and spent $13.00 on this CD and it is not worth 5. First of all the whole CD has no tune to it whatsoever, it has like 2 good songs on it, and the quality on most of the tracks are so bad that there is no point to even listening to the full song. Bright Eyes might be talented, but only on one song of the album. Honestly, 'Lover I Dont Have To Love' is the only song worth listening to -- Just go get it on Kazaa and spend your money on a CD thats worth it!"
1,Web Belt and Buckel Disapponted,"I was disappointed in the quality..Not made in USA like some military web belts. Cheap quality ""brass plated"" buckle. I would have thought Rothco would have better quality if it is really a Rothco product... Also only 46"" long.. most web belts are 54"". After you wash them they will really shrink so you need a long one to start with.."
4,Most intriguing book,Most of us have heard about the alleged sensitivity of animals to imminent earthquakes. This Japanese academic author makes quite a persuasive case that the anecdotal material has a solid core of reality to it and the sensitivity is due to animal reaction to precursory low frequency electromagnetic waves generated underground from piezoelectric effects on quartz. He reports a good deal of substantiating laboratory tests. This is quite clearly presented for the cutting-edge science it is. My only reservation is some speculative parts
3,Marred by poor editing,"This book had a fantastic premise, and an intriguing storyline filled with betrayal, murder, shady government plots, and revolutionaries. The biggest problem with this book however is that it is marred by poor editing.I found an unusually large number of typographical errors (and I don't mean British v. American spelling), as well as some passages that were either poorly worded, or had TOO MANY words.I may enjoy this book when I read it again. I know that I didn't get all of it, and it is so complex in the plot that it deserves another reading."
4,Grantwriting for Dummies,"With this book, I could have saved a lot of money and not purchased the three other grantwriting books I bought. This was perfect!"
4,....for DUMMINES! Only means a THOROUGH presentation .,"I have purchased and read several of these books for DUMMIES. And, in every case I have been rewarded by the thoroughness in which the subject was treated. To me, no one is a DUMMIE who admits that he doesn't KNOW IT ALL. These books present the total picture of a given subject in an uncluttered straight-forward fashion. This book meets that goal so I heartily RECOMMEND IT. Note: I have over 35 years of professional writing and strategic planning experience.John Tyler Gibson, Livonia, Michigan."
5,Finally,"My mum wanted this particular book. Glad I found it here. Service was prompt, inexpensive, and the book was in great shape."
3,Grant Writting for Dummies CD,Does have a lot of information but it needs to have a workbook or PDF downloads to help you keep track of the resources and proceedures. Unless you know shorthand and can write or type as fast as the speaker is reading I recommend the book.As far as the content - good - but I would suggest researching your funding sources first.
3,Great idea!,More difficult than I anticipated a subject matter hat I really would like to learn but the way it is displayed was a little too difficult
2,Good Intro,"This is a good intro, without much information on actual grants for specific purposes. If you are an educator, non-profit, or individual interested in grants related to technology, for innovation, curriculum, development, emerging technologies, I recommend Technology Grant News: Everything Technology: Awards-Contests-Grants-Scholarships.Technology Grant News: Everything Technology [2007]:Awards ¿ Contests ¿ Grants -Scholarships ¿ Fellowships"
5,"Best speaker, and Price in it's class",I love this center channel speaker for this specific infinity series of speakers............. I recomend 100%...................you won't find a better sound for the price....
4,decent,worked pretty well on my f-250 me an a buddie put em in in about three hours must have adjustable track bar ( learned that the hard way)
3,Good Quality Construction - Poor Design,"The box itself is made of quality material and has a solid feel to it.Unfortunately, I bought the box to store video tapes and was astounded to discover that the VHS video tapes don't fit. The tapes can be inserted into the box but the box then bulges at the sides. That's just the tape. If the tape has a case - forget it. Don't even think you can get a Disney box into this. It's too bad because there aren't many alternatives available for VHS Tape storage.I gave it three stars because the box is well constructed and should work just fine for photo storage.I would suggest looking elsewhere for a place to put your video tapes."
4,Like it,"This box is very sturdy,,Bought to organize my shelf under my computer...to keep my extra disc in ..Works perfect..I just wish it would come in different colors.."
1,Not what I ordered,I wish I would have read the reviews prior to placing my order. I did not get what I ordered which was a black photo box. I received a bright red photo box instead!!!! I guess I was luckier than most?!?!?!?
1,Disappointing,"If you are looking for a ""What Color Is Your Parachute"" book for guidance on making the most of your life between 50 and 75, this is not it. It is a collection of impressions and interviews with successful cheerful retired professionals, rather than a hard look at our choices and how to make major decisions on jobs, families, finances, health, and spiritual well-being. Her subjects are uniformly propserous, well-educated, self-aware, and articulate. It reads like an expanded article from the Washington Post, and since the author is a Post writer there, no wonder. Lawyers and doctors are her featured subjects. Some of the books and studies she cites may be worth pursing, but it is hard to tell. This book fills its market niche, but a wider audience could use a more comprehensive and analytic guide to these potentially productive and enjoyable years, as another reviewer puts it. This it reads like Gail Sheehy for 2004."
3,Expensive stereo with low quality CD eject mechanism,"Full featured stereo system, once you buy all the add-ons ($$$). The screen is nice-sized. I recommend the Navigation add-on.I had to send it back to the factory for a stuck CD, and after getting it back, another CD got stuck after just a little bit of use. My CD's are clean and original disks. There is no reason for this to happen. This is why I give it a lower score."
1,Obscure & Objectionable,"This grammar book is not only esoteric (linguistic terms) and obscure, but it also uses sample sentences with the word ""booz,"" drunken state of being, and other unprofessional habits. Tables do not label or display different tenses of the verbs, and the table titles are not even written in English. The author must have been on booz when he selected examples. A pocket guide with tables and patterns would be more helpful than the crazy examples and unclear grammar in this book! This book is not useful for international learners who are attempting to learn the Korean language and make sense out of the grammar. In fact, this book is not even good for any learners."
4,Okay for the price,"I use it as a gym bag, it's okay for that. I wish there was an inside pocket though."
1,Late night AM radio rant in a book,"I don't know how I can say any bad thing about this book that hasn't already been said. The points where the author totally lost me was when he claimed that French tanks, with one man turrets and no radios, suffered no real disadvantage, and that that the French had so many tanks that they could afford to disperse them as infantry support (ignoreing that a large number of these tanks were the quite obsolete FT-17).If you want a book with contrarian views on WWII that is actually right in facts and opinion, read _Dirty Little Secrets of WWII_ instead."
3,"Mosier has some issues, the reviewers seem to have more","This book will touch plenty of nerves, as is obvious. Mosier likes to stretch a thought further than it should go. His lack of coverage of the eastern front is a critical miss. In my opinion he touched on some good points but certainly overreached. Play some thought games with the recent strategy of rapid armored advance the US used in Iraq, even against limited defensive capabilities.But I have to comment on Todor Kornovski's claim of Mosier's ""lie"", where he no doubt refers to the info on pages 76/77. I will assume the reviewer knows that Britain and France did attack in Sept. 1939 starting the 'Phony War' and these attacks failed utterly. However, nowhere does the author use the quote attributed to him by the reviewer. This passage is but one of many examples the author uses. That is part of the overall debate, but to misquote intentionally, and imply that this encapsulates the whole book, is absurd."
1,It gets a single star because one can't give it zero.,"I am grateful to Mr. Michael Licari, who provided a fine review in enough detail that I don't need to waste more time with this book to write one of my own. To my mind, this book illustrates the all too common use of a provocative title and uneven research to sell a book. When one can claim Suvorov (Rezun) as a pivotal source one needs to revaluate their acceptance criteria.In short, it is a poorly reasoned screed that is authoritatively written so that one can be mislead into believing that the author knows what he is talking about. While there are a few worthy points in the book they aren't worth the sorting reqired to find them."
1,The Revisionist Author Myth,"This book ranks at the top of my list for books that never should have been written. It is painfully clear that Mosier is no historian. No military commander in history would reject executing an overwhelming assault if it were in his capability. Mosier states over and over that leaders on both sides failed to learn their lessons. Wars and even battles are evolutionary in nature and no one knows exactly how they will turn out. Using the author's logic, Mike Tyson's success in the boxing ring was not because he was more skilled or more powerful but because he had a political advantage."
1,A tragedy the likes only an English professor could conjure,"Words simply cant describe my utter contempt for the lack of authoritative research the author displays in this pedantic effort. I will not repeat the previous maligns of this novel only to say that any student of WWII armored warfare will cringe at the numerous inaccuracies, pufferies, and fallacies throughout this tragedy of errors. The ""author"" even opines that the Panther tank first saw service in 1944? This glaring mistake typifies the entire work. The Blitzkrieg Myth is a dumbed down effort targeted for those readers who know even less than the author. Please Mr. Mosier, I want my money back!!!"
1,Used flash,When this flash got to my house it was no doubt used. I didn't see anywhere on the site about it being used. I sent it back and I still haven't recieved a refund and it's been about a month now.
4,"Hot moves, but not a ""workout""","This is a great instructional video but it really can't be classified as a ""burlesque workout"". The movements demonstrated are informative for developing a routine but if you are looking for a workout, this probably won't be it, primarily due to the order of presentation. There is good information on costumes, stage personas, even picking a name - but the poor production quality lowered my rating to a 4. Get this if you want to develop a burlesque dance routine but look elsewhere for calorie burning."
3,Okay Video,I purchased this and have used it maybe once. Its not what I expected and dosn't really do that many moves or go thoroughlly through the moves. More for the already advanced dancer I think.Thanks!!!
2,Not a workout- waste of money,"This was a total waste of money if one is looking for a fun ""workout"". The woman was scary, the filming was amateur, the whole thing was tacky. I mean, I was expecting a little tacky because it is burlesque but this was way beyond over the top. I was expecting a breakdown of burlesque moves and then a routine using those moves to give me a workout. Instead there were tips on how to do bumps and grinds, how to stand etc but never did I see an actual routine. HORRIBLEThe ONLY reason that this got a second star is because of the woman with the tassle twirling. I found it informative, fun and I am ready to run out and find some tassles to give this a try.The other bonuses were a waste of my time and worse than tacky. DO NOT GET THIS DVD. That would be my best advice."
2,a little disapointing,"It didn`t impress me, perhaps because I didn`t know what burlesque dance was, and was expecting something diferent."
1,not a workout..and a bit scary,"I found this dvd to be a bit scary, like the woman instructor was really a man in drag. The production value was homemade and it was not a workout, it seems as if the word ""workout"" was added to the packaging afterwards as well as repackaging the cover....the instructor is over-the-top and I found a bit tacky. Back the workout, there are too many interuptions to consider it a workout, but I tried even doing the moves by themselves and repeating them and still found them to be instructional, but not a workout that would have any exercise benefits: cardio, core, flexibility or otherwise. She certainly does not discuss the muscles you are using or should be focusing on. Burlesque seems to be a rare topic,and this was the only one I could find, but I am sure there will be more dvds soon, I just ordered Carmen Electra's new Bedroom & Cardio Burlesque by Dolfina and I will let you know how those are when I receive them!"
1,Dissapointing,"Ok...First of all, this is not a workout by any means!She teaches you some moves at a very low pace, very uninspiring, terrible quality of the video, it'sworse than homemade. I suggest Dolphina's burlesque dvd, it's a lot more motivating to do."
3,Disappointing,"This comprehensive, yet pretty humble edition of Edward S. Curtis work, should be suitable for those who are looking for some textual info and general images of Edward's artwork about the Plains Indian. For those of us who are looking for more, it's slightly a disappointment, mostly because of the lack of balance between the images and the text. Despite of the modest size of this book, it's hard to find an excuse for such small and poor quality prints. After all the main issue here should be the remarkable artwork of Curtis and therefore it's a bit missed."
4,Great Voice and Good Looking!!!,"When I first listened to this cd I was in a way disappointed, partly because I was comparing him to Josh Groban which is my ""main man""!!! I have always loved the romantic songs in a different language and any cd that is like that I buy. I grew up listening to opera and I come from an Italian heritage, But I do enjoy this cd I think he could have picked some better songs to go with his style and voice capacity. Then again it is his first cd , but I am looking forward to see what he comes out with next. He has great potential and his voice is incredible!!! I will buy his next one defineatly!!!"
5,Sometimes I Dream - Mario Frangoulis,"The music world can always make room for another wonderful singer who is capable of transporting us regardless of the language. Even though Josh Groban is my favorite, Mario is wonderful in his own way. My favorite track is Vincero, Perdero, (can't get it out of my head). I look forward to hearing more from Mario Frangoulis."
5,Excellent Tenor Voice,"This young man is an excellent singer. He is, by far, the best of the crossover tenors, i.e. Groben, Watson, and yes, I'll include Bocelli in the list that he is better than. If anyone doubts the quality of his tenor voice, listen to his singing of Puccini's E luccevan le stelle (embedded within Sometimes I Dream). It is as good as anyone I have heard at the Met in recent years. The fact that he has talent, and has had good training, shows."
5,What a voice!,"I fell in love with Mario Frangoulis' first track ""Vincero, Perdero,"" and then I listed to the rest of the CD, which is great! I sent my mom a copy because I knew she would love it! I cannot wait for his next CD to come out and I definitely cannot wait to see him in concert, that is of course if he ever makes it out to Hawaii! If you love music sung in Italian or Spainsh like I do you will love this CD."
3,Good New Italian Singer,"I just reviewed a couple of songs. Mario has more of a ""pop"" voice than opera. I first go for 1)Alessandro Safina, 2)Josh Groban, 3)Russell Watson, then 4)Mario Fangoulis; so for with this new style of Classical POP singing."
2,An opera rip-off does not make you a great singer...,"I was distressed and disgusted with ""Sometimes I Dream"" being a rip-off of ""E lucevan le stelle"", from Tosca. He's not the singer for me....and his cover of ""Nights in White Satin"" was very ho-hum. Justin Hayward should have stayed with the Moody Blues for that one."
4,"Welcome, Mario","A very fine debut album of songs geared to popular tastes, all that's missing is actually seeing this handsome Greek singing them. Everything points to international stardom for Mario Frangoulis."
5,AMAZING...,"From the first time I heard Mario Frangoulis sing, not only did I hear beautiful music, but a voice that touched my soul. He is truly amazing...."
5,Just a powerful soft touch to your ears!,"When I brought this CD, at the beginning I was doubtful about it because this tenor is relatively new and he is young too, but when I heard the songs I was impressed because the quality of his voice is just like a soft touch to your ears, is very comfortable and the selection of the songs and the arrangements of the song ""sometimes I dream"" was delightful and powerful at the same time, I really recomend this item, if you like great tenors definitely you have to buy this CD!!!"
5,second review,I just wrote my first review and decided I must write another -You must buy this CD - you will be very lucky if you do.I just listened to my CD again - His voice is so nuanced - his performance so sensitive.He truly makes you want to cry.If you can fall in love with an artist you don't know - he is the one.Best wishes MarioThank you for gracing us with the beauty you create.- may you achieve all the success and happiness you deserve.
5,Greatness Has Arrived,"To discover ""true"" passionate talent almost makes one giddy given the drivel that is constantly pushed at us by the media and by certain reality shows. Mario is a find that seems to surface all to rarely. This virtuoso is a goose-bump inducing, jaw-dropping performer with one of the best voices in existence today.If you've only had the pleasure of listening to the CD, do yourself a favor and get the accompanying DVD - you'll witness rare greatness!"
3,Just OK,"These are nice to have on hand because they are convenient, but neither my 1 year old or my 2 year old will eat it without adding a touch of salt. VERY plain, even for little ones."
4,Yum,"My two-year-old loves these, which is saying something because he's the pickiest eater on the planet. We'll definitely buy them again."
1,Absolutely disgusting,"I tried to feed this to my oldest daughter when she was a toddler, she refused it. My second daughter who eats almost anything said ""YUCK!"" when I tried to feed it to her. And I can't blame either one of them. The product looks nothing like the photo on the jar. It's like a gelatinous substance with vegetables mixed in. Terrible! Save your money!"
3,A for effort...,"Um, yeah, what the title says. My son just doesn't like them. But, they are an easy on the go meal... hope that helps? I will say this much: HE DOES PREFER THESE TO THE STANDARD/ STORE BRAND VARIETY. STANDARD = 'THE CHEF' (girl i x) LMAO"
2,Golden Age of Looney Tunes Vol. 10: The Art of Bugs,"I use to have ""Tortoise Beats Hare"", ""Rabbit Transit"", and ""Bugs Bunny Rides Again"" on The Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 2 while Grammy and Grampa got ""Haredevil Hare"", ""Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid"" and ""Tortoise Wins by the Hare"", on Looney Tunes Golden Collection, at their house. I've also watched ""The Old Grey Hare"". So, it's has to be part of Max Goudiss Cartoon Treasures, titled as ""Cartoon Treasures presents Bugs Bunny""."
4,Hip-hop's new fortress,"From Smother Magazine - www.smother.netLinkin Park's Mike Shinoda turns his focus onto his side project Fort Minor, which found him recording, producing, and playing everything on ""The Rising Tied"". Executive produced by Jay-Z, ""The Rising Tied"" returns Mike to his hip-hop roots. But that's not the only star appearance; the Roots' Black Thought, Common, Linkin Park DJ Joe Hahn, John Legend, Kenna, and others also guest and collaborate. Hard beats, shrill rhythms, and stellar rhymes are around every turn. While there's certainly a bevy of pop hooks that the mainstream will gladly accept with open arms, there are also enough dirty and gritty portions that will fill up the underground's coffers."
5,Rap album of the year!,Mike shinoda is a pure music genuis. If you have not hear of fort minor then you must be living under a rock. Or maybe you never had heard of linkin park then. MIke is the master mind behind the raps from lp. I have been waiting for this cd for years. If your not a fan of rap you will be now. MIke played almost every instrument on this cd and what could be better then jay-z producing the final touches. Every song grabs you and puts you on the edge of your seat. The beats are banging on every track. THe lyrics are from the heart and soul. This cd shoud be favored for the rap cd of the year. Just can't wait to see what next in the linkin park chapter.
5,Shinoda = The Man Behind LP,"I have to say, I have been a Linkin Park fan since the original release date of Hybrid Theory, I was even a fan when they were named Hybrid Theory, a friend of mine got me the first listen way back in the day, and since then I have been a release date buyer, and I must say I was the same way with this album, and I can't be dissappointed, Shinoda is the man. That's really all there is to say it, Chester may have the voice I prefer, but Shinoda's lyrics, are what make songs, and a solo album by him, is exactly what I had expected. A+ material."
3,An Album that Almost Gets it Right,"This album comes so close to getting it right. Excellent production coupled with a lyricist who's made the decision to not talk about the standard money and disrespecting women that's so prevelant in hip-hop. While he's mostly succesful in this he ends right back in the other track that hip-hop generally finds itself in, hating on the haters. Whether his rage is directed at his bandmates, producers, music industry folks or what remains unclear but for much of the album he gripes about how people be hating on his solo project, how the industry didn't support him in Linkin Park so why are the gonna do it now. This generally leaves a huge elephant in the room, his ""other"" band. Or his band this being the ""other"" remain in question, is this who he really is or this a side project? Even our MC doesn't seem to know and that's where this album falls short."
5,"upcoming band? no, just a new look.","mike shinoda of linkin park has emerged with tak, ryu, dj cheapshot, and other members of styles of beyond to create thr rising tied. now, i like remember the name and petrified, but their best songs are clearly where'd you go and get me gone. shinoda flows extremely well, and in different ways. this album also shows off 17-year-old tak, a new rapper of fort minor, playing tag team with shinoda and ryu. this cd should be bought in its entirety, and every song needs to be given a chance. this is the most well-rounded cd since sticks and stones of early 2004. so if you havent bought them both already, so so now."
1,Why would anyone like this?,"Typical radio trash. I almost threw up the first time I heard it. However, I respect them for being business men and making millions of dollars while at the same time having no talent. Other then that, meh."
4,Mike = The Rising Star,"This cd was really good. I heard Petrified and became very interested in this group. Then I talked to my roommate and she reccomended I get a copy, so I did. I love how different this is from Mike's stuff with Linkin Park. I think this cd really allowed him to develop himself personally as an artist more than he can when he is with LP. As someone said, he is not the best rapper ever but with some more work could be a potentially great one. The beats all have a nice tempo to them and alot of the lyrics are real. My favorite song is Cigarette because the beat is slick and Mike's lyrics are definitely applicable to alot of rappers out right now. Overall, this cd had some nice lyrics, great beats, and adds a refreshing new flavor to the hip hop community."
5,The Rising Tied is an amazing album...,"I bought this album about 4 monthes ago at a local music store, and I love it. I first heard of Fort Minor in Linkinpark.com and actually started listening to it when my friend reccommended it to me. I was also amazed because Mike Shinoda played almost every instrument in the album, and he worked with many people, including Holly Brook, Kenna, and members of Styles of Beyond, and many more people i forgot... I think if you are a fan of Linkin Park, you will most likely love it. Holly Brook is also amazing and she is featured in Where'd You Go. oh, and by the way, whoever wrote ""FORT MINOR ROCKS"" by Horsedreamer, Fort Minor is not a person. Mike Shinoda is the guy you call ""the guy of 2006"". its more like a side project. but i agree that Mike is hot... lol :]"
4,A Kids Review is WRONG,"A kids review above mine is wrong saying that this album is ""clean"" while in more than one song Mike Shinoda drops the F bomb so im not sure if that constitues clean, but it doesn't in my book. But i do agree that it is a greet album and the best songs are Kenji and Where'd you go"
4,A Short Review of a Great Album,"Mike Shinoda is trying to experiment with his more urban side in this album. Although formally a lead singer of Linkin Park, he now brings his rock influence to the table in this amazing hip hop album. His voice isn't enough to really carry this ablum to be anything that will be greatly rememerable, but if you are looking for a good hip hop album focused on beats, than you will definately like this. He is white, so a lot of the choruses are sung, and since his lyrics are more articulated, he is trying to make his point rather than talk about vulgar obsenities and disrespect toward certain people or races. He also reveals his political beliefs when it comes to government, drugs, and discrimination. Its a very powerful album, but doesn't quite fit into the mold enough to be a rememerable hip hop album. As its own subgenre though, it's amazing. But it tries to be too many things."
4,actually... 4/12 stars,this album is tight man. My favorite songs are*Remember the Name*petrified*In stereo*Red to BlackBuy this CDp... It's some awesome hip-hop(first reviewer! YES!)
3,Nice concept and ideas,"Fort Minor's The Rising Tied is Mike Shinoda's side project to Linkin Park. Shinoda the rapper for Linkin Park knows a good track when he hears one. The beats and the rhythms are very remindful of L.P.'s back beats. Mike has strong ideas. ""Kenjir"" is a good example. The song about the WWII internment of the American Japanese is a strong song ideally, but the rapping and lyrics sometimes seem almost Juvenile. That's too bad for a song that had a lot more potential. You can only imagine how strong this song would have been with a more powerful rapper. That song is the synopsis of the CD: Very powerful in parts, but weak in others. I hate to deduct points for the lack of outstanding vocals, but it is warranted. With better vocals and raps this would have been 4 stars."
5,NOT 50% pain,"This is the coolest rap album of the year (possibly even THE best)Also, this really IS a clean cd. they even block out gunmen and shot... Shinoda even changes his verse in some parts (example, he changes ""with some brand new crack"" to ""with a brand new attack""ANYWAY.... the best tracks areIn stereoRemember the nameKenjiGet me goneyeah... regular cd is best, but this is okay.buy it loser!"
4,Good,"Well it's definetly not bad, but there's a lot of mainstrem on this album tho, I would like that there would be more albums like this on the mainstream. But there is one interesting thing on this album, the instrumental on ""believe me"" resembles a lot an instrumental of a song created by a local hip hop group in my coutry, the song is titled ""muzika kuri saugo"", well mostly it is the violin part that resembles it. i'm interested where did they sample it"
5,Mike Shinoda always amazes me!!!,I knew that Mike Shinoda would never disappoint us! The new Fort Minor album is amazing! I would give it 10 stars if the ratings went that high! Congrats to Mike on the release of something so great!! I can not wait to see what the future has in store for Mike and all the Fort Minor members!
5,So cute,"I really like the Doggles line of dog harnesses. They are well made and very cute although they do run a little big. My dog, Abby, usually wears a medium in jackets (and the medium size pjs wouldn't even cover her fat little butt) but the small in this harness fits good. The biker vest is also very cute but since I didn't want her to get the faux leather vest wet during rainy season I bought her the jeans vest as well.Doggles Biker Vest Dog Harness, Black, Small"
2,Stiff and oddly sized,"It came and it looks just like the picture, but i think only certain stocky, short-haired, long neck dogs would really look right in it. I cannot use it at all. It seems larger than sized, also. It reminds me more of a piece of armor than a harness jacket, heavy and stiff, but on certain dogs it may look just fine,maybe like a Jack Russell. I wanted something softer, smaller and more adjustable."
5,Great harness construction and style!,"This is the fourth harness I have bought from Doggles. They have all been constructed very well and are very stylish. My yorkies love them, I had to return one since it wasn't exactly what I thought it would be and they sent me a new one and I received it one day early. Great service. I will definitely by more from them."
2,So disappointed...,"This looks adorable in the picture. However, the fabric wasn't sturdy enough to use often and the fit is way off for a small."
1,Mine won't open either,"Exactly as the previous post says, the green open lock light is there, you hear something happening, but you can't open it. You can't get worse then a safe that locks you out of your own valuables, key code or not."
1,Crap,"Seems I have the same problem as everyone else. You would think a company like this would care for their reputation and craftsmanship. Apparently they care for neither. Wish I had read the review before purchasing. Apparently they know it is a problem if their solution is to hit it with a hammer. Now I have a huge piece for crap good for nothing. Will not every buy a Sentry product again, and will tell everyone I come into contact with to do the same."
4,Kids' Ten Commandments as a Collection - View Individually,"Since our children will be studying the Ten Commandments throughout the year from various angles and specific connection with various Biblical characters who did or did not live them out, it was helpful to have a collection that allows us to focus on just one commandment at a time, even though each DVD covered two commandments. Nice graphics and kept the children's attention. We added additional resources - drama, storytelling, crafts, music - to provide us a full hour of equipping time."
5,Exceptional,"My 2 year old daughter loves this set and constantly asks to watch her new dvds!! She tells everyone that she likes Moses and the boys. She's just a little afraid of the intro music and the ""lion"". I'm happy she's learning more about God's laws."
4,Very good videos for young kids!,Very well done videos for your kids. Our kids liked seeing all 10 commandments and it gives a great opportunity to explain the commandments to them.
1,Not exciting,"Perhaps there are better bible telling animations out there. I should have shopped around more. I'm not a fan of anime, I call this biblical anime."
5,Kids' Ten Commandments exceptionally done!,"Each episode focuses on 2 of the commandments and creates a beautiful storyline to help everyone understand the concept. For example, keeping the Sabbath day holy and not swearing/taking the Lord's name in vain are grouped together. An older man forces a boy and his animals to work on the Sabbath and he continues to ""swear by God."" The boy and the animals sing and remind him of the commandments. Later Moses comes to the man and reprimands him. It gets accross a serious message that children understand and then can apply to their lives. The music is catchy and fun to sing along with. I have 5 kids ages 2-10 and they love the videos. We have watched them over and over in our home and gave them to cousins this year for Christmas.Kids' Ten Commandments: The Complete Collection"
5,nice book,the Tauton Press always does a nice layout and great info.... Good pictures and diagrams make for good reading and info.
3,"great idea, cheap implementation","I was really looking forward to this board, and I was slightly disappointed with the quality. It's still fun, but the cheap, ""dollar store"" feel of the pieces takes away some of it. It wasn't expensive, and I'm glad I got it, I just would not buy it as a gift, because of the above. I wish they made it little better and even charged slightly more for it."
5,So cute!,"The earrings arrived fast. They were well packaged, and substantial (yet tiny, as advertised)metal content. I know my daughter will love them. (X-Mas gift)"
5,Presents recipes that feed firefighters of New York,"Award-winning chef Keith Young presents recipes that feed firefighters of New York, in Cooking With The Firehouse Chef. From Garlic Bread with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce; Butternut Bisque; Steak Salad; and Parmesan-Crusted Pork Chops; to Pan-Seared Tuna; Broccoli and Corn Succotash; Grandma's Irish Soda Bread; and John Sineno's Famous No-Bake Rice Pudding, easily prepared dishes with expressive taste fill the pages of this working man's recipe collection, which is embellished with black-and-white photographs and narrative asides concerning the firefighters who daily dedicate their lives to their home city's protection."
1,"Avoid this movie - waste of time - not ""electrifying""","Wow. This was a horrible movie. The story didn't go anywhere. Things happen and such, but at the end it leaves you thinking ""What was the point?"" There is some very off-color content, not only dark, but creepy/disturbing. At times I felt it had a Pokemon feel to it (not kidding) - out of nowhere, graphics appear. The film is nowhere near the power and quality of the ""Kids"" Movie. There are some truly bizarre musical/rap interludes - imagine Backstreet Boys but 1000 times worse. There was a lot of hopelessness in it as well. Although the boys had challenging lives, it was odd because they had cell phones, internet access, clothing, food, shelter, and so forth. They are victims of their decisions. I felt this movie was a waste of time."
2,"Not a classic, too strange movie","If Your are thinking on getting an easy to understand movie , this is not the one, I saw it once, I wont see it again, sorry didnt like it.besides I dont like the rap song on the soundtrack"
1,Poor Customer Service,"I noticed for every poor review someone jumps on to give them five stars...please ignore this as it is likely someone from the company trying to maintain high ratings. I checked the reviews prior to placing an order and noted the positive ones. I ordered a simple product on the Oct. 18th and was told delivery between Oct. 22nd to Oct. 28th. Today is the 29th and the product as not arrived. Emails to inquire of the shipping status remain unanswered. When I checked the reviews again today, I finally noticed the pattern of good reviews popping up in an attempt to cancel out the poor ones. If they had time to watch the reviews, they should have had time to respond to email inquiries. Plan to return the product unopened if it ever arrives."
5,Sailor Hat,This is a sturdy adult hat. We bought less expensive hats from Oriental Trading - which worked for getting hats for 48 little boy heads. These were nicer to use for adults - the fabric was sturdier and felt more comfortable on an adult hat. My 10 year old could easily wear this as well. If you don't need to buy a lot - this is better quality for your money.
4,Worth it,I purchased to complete a Popeye costume and was pleased to see the fit and how quickly I recieved the item. Reliable source.
4,It's Great,I tried a lot to search such type of charger. but their cost was so high. But from Amazon i got this charger in very cheap rate. And product is so good and it's working great
1,This sux,"When I started charging my K750i, it didnt charge at all no matter what. This is a load of s***. dont buy it"
5,Some of the best from one of the South's best writers ...,"Faulkner is, without a doubt, one of the South's best writers, and re-reading this collection of novels after many years affirms that belief for me. He was a master of words and I wish we had more Faulkner novels to feast on. Almost no one can measure up to him!"
5,William Faulkner early works from Library of America,"Each story in this collection is written with a great original style, and the writing is of high quality. The stories are varied, and there is a definate lack of fear on the part of the author in the writing."
5,Olympus LI-12B Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery,A reliable battery but would suggest two as they tend to run out of juice at the worst time.
4,"Genuine battery, good battery power","This is a genuine Olympus battery. People sell in EBAY says genuine, but they are all fake China made battery.I recommend to buy this battery. But it is pricey I would say. Atleast 10 doller is high."
4,battery,"Great product, long lasting is rechargeable. I take lots of pictures with my digital camera and I just needed to have a second battery for a back up."
1,Battery,I really can't review the battery since the camera died a few days after installing it. Nothing to do with the battery.
1,When suggesting additional items to go with items purchasing please be clearer!,When I was buying my husbands Olympus Camera this Rechargeable battery popped up as a suggested purchase to go with camera so I ordered it. Not paying close enough attention and because the title does have stylus in it I assumed it was compatable with the camera I was purchasing at that time. No it was not!!! So I paid for and wraped (christmas present) something that did not only not work for the camera but made me look like a idiot shopper when my husband opened it and saw that it was not compatiable. Now I have to figure out how to send it back for a refund which will cost me shipping charges yet again...NOT TO MENTION THE FRUSTRATION OF A RETURN!!!!NOT A HAPPY AMAZON SHOPPER!!
5,Olympus battery,This is the EXACT same battery that came with my camera & at 1/2 the cost of buying it from Olympus! I'm a photographer & go through several batteries in one shoot. I was very happy to find these same high quality batteries for a MUCH lower price! I would recommend them to anyone.
1,Olympus LI-12B Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery,My problem is not specifically with this particular product but that the item ordered was not what was in the package. Someone placed the wrong battery in the packing. I had to send it back because I could not use it. Amazon was very prompt at refunding my money.
5,Olympus camera battery,"Product was completely up to expectations. Completely satisfied. I tested it & it was charged. Data Vision provided the exact product that I needed, even though the camera was a few years old."
5,LI- 12b Battery for Olympus,Very good battery. Very hard to find - many links to this number (12b) but they turn out to be the lower capacity 10b. It is worth the search to find the 12b. This 12b adds easily 50-70 digital pictures - including using flash (c-765 camera). I recycled the 10b's I had to switch solely to this higher capacity battery.
5,A must-have for all 1-Ls,"It's only been a couple of weeks into my first year of law school, and everything Greene has written about in her book has been right on target. During the summer I read several books on this subject to get me ready for law school, but this Dummies version is definitely the best. It is honest, insightful, easy to read, and hits all the important topics -- how to study for tests, how to look for jobs, what the real ""law firm"" world is like, etc. I liked how Greene showed both sides of the issue, since there certainly are downsides to being a lawyer. A worthwhile purchase for all entering first-years."
2,"Fascinating outline of topics, but where's the detail?","It's almost as if Rebecca Greene JD, the author, doesn't want to give away HER special secret knowledge about law school, but, honey, isn't that what the Dummies people were paying you for?For example, she provides an example of a 1st-year law school exam question, but no example of what an answer would look like. She discusses preparing outlines and provides 1 example but doesn't explain why the outline includes the materials it does. She mentions the super-condensed outline, like the ""revision"" that British students are so famous for, but no example of what this might look like.Buy this book if you want a tantalizing peak at some of the things you'll experience in law school, but there must be better guides that will actually tell you how to succeed."
5,Pick this up!!!!,"This is the best law school guidebook I've read so far in my law school career. At first I must confess that I was a bit skeptical that a ""For Dummies"" book would be so comprehensive and intelligent--but this book has surpassed all my expectations. It reads as if you're talking with an upperclassperson.I am recommending this book to all my law school friends and especially for anyone who wants a realistic perspective of what law school is really like."
5,What is most important?,"What is the only thing more important than our health? The health of our children. MacWilliam has given us a great way to find althernatives to the vitamn-laced candy we find on the shelves. With studies showing that 30-50% of the children in this country are going to grow up with nutrition-linked diseases such as diabetes, we need every tool we can get to combat this epidemic. MacWilliam has given us a well researched guide that we can trust."
4,It works well enough.,"I was hoping for something a little nicer than this. It was so much pricier than the small micron bags for other dust collectors offered by Grizzly. It wasn't worth it to return it.The catalog suggested that the material was slick, but it's just a felt-like material. The mouth seems too large and you need to buy a hose clamp to properly seal it, but then I realized that it made the bag far easier to empty. I would reccommend it, but I'd rather own the Penn State Industries bag (but they are overpriced)."
5,One of the Best Honegger Discs,"I can compare the performances of these two with Plasson's EMI 2-disc set. They are a lot more steady, wieghty, and, to me, more appropriate for Honegger's music.This ""Pacific 231"" is far preferable to the one Plasson conducts on that admirable set. If you think Pacific 231 should move more steady, this is what you want. Full recommendation to Honegger lovers."
4,Not too bad,"I'm giving it 4 stars only because the tether that goes over the top of the seat to hook behind the seat is a little confusing... and the padding in the head area is a bit much. My daughter sits with her head forward. So I raised the padding, still too much for her, so I took some of the padding out! Now it's fine."
5,best wiggles dvd! don't get any others!,"no need to get any other wiggles dvds. this one has it all and skips the ""story parts"" of the regular shows and sticks with just the songs/dancing, which is what most kids want to see."
5,Fabulous for my grandkids.,This video has been captivating for my 21 month old grandson. He loves it. The best money I've ever spent!!!
4,"excellent for kids, lacks sound quality","Th evideo is excellent my son loves the wiggles he dances with it , claps, and he can sit and watck it for over 30 miN !!! RECORD TIME ! The only problem of course he doesnt notice is the sound quality !!! The volume goes up and down and its really bad ! This must be because its an old production. Besides it its a good video for kids."
4,20 years of Wiggles,"This DVD selects one or two videos from each prior DVD - even back to the early 1990s - and identifies what DVD they are from. Not sure all their selections are truly ""best of"" (who really thinks ""Here Comes a Chicken"" warrants inclusion?) but it is a great DVD for introducing The Wiggles' music to kids who have not seen it. My kids, who have all the prior DVDs, still love to watch it. The extras are interesting (mostly interviews, very early videos, and videos in other languages). My kids love the early videos and the ones in other languages."
5,Great,THe product arrived very quickly and arrived on time. THe product worked correctly. Overall I had no issues to deal with
5,Hot Potatoes are Hot in our house!,"My grandaughter loves the Wiggles, so I purchased this DVD for her. She is 2 yrs old, and will watch it over and over, but what is really funny, is that my daughter and son-in-law will also watch it over and over, and often start singing the songs even when the DVD is not on. Great for 2 yr olds, and 30 somethings also!"
4,A very usable and useful tripod,"I'm not a professional photographer or videographer. I just wanted this product to videotape my new baby and other family events on my digital camcorder. The tripod is easy to set up and use. Panning the camera around is fairly smooth and easy. Overall, for the price, I don't think this product can be beaten."
1,Broke the second time I used it.,This is a very cheap tripod. I highly recommend spending $15.00 more and getting something that is built a little better. The second time I used this tripod the plastic center ring that stabilizes the the three legs broke. It snapped when I was tightening it to hold the ring in place. Since it would cost me as much to ship the tripod back to Sunpak as I paid to buy it in the first place I am just tossing it in the trash and looking a little more closely at the construction of the replacement I will be buying.
5,Good Value,"Purchased this for around the home/studio/workshop use, at the price paid it represents excellent value. No complaints whatsoever. I liked the fact that an extra mount was included."
5,Great,"This thing is compact and effective, as well as very sturdy. This tripod does the trick for my amateur photography purposes. Plus it's affordable!Highly recommended."
1,poor plastics,"I just received it and tried it right away. It looked decent, but if you look closely you feel the plastics are very cheap. So cheap that the center screw broke away with very little effort. I really wished this to work. But it has to go back. If you own a DSLR it is not right for you. Please spend another $20 and get a better tripod."
5,Very nice,This is a video i made about the unboxing. The tripod is about 4 feet tall and i recomeend it to everybody. it is an ideal tripod and it is light weight and compact.[...]
5,Tripod,"This tripod is perfect for my craft needs where I do You Tube videos on the mini albums I make. The adjustable legs are perfect to use for different angles. I like how easy it is to put together and put back in a nice compact size for easy storage. I loved the speedy service, too!"
3,Keyword: Travel,"This is a pretty solid little tripod, but check the measurements before you buy it. It's not very tall, so it's sort of useless for most of my shoots.There's no bubble level, either, so it's tough to line shots up perfectly.Now you know."
5,Great product. Great price,This is a very sturdy tripod. It made my old tripod look like a dinosaur. Didn't think such an inexpensive product would be so well made. It was delivered on time too!
4,Great tripod for the price,I carried this all over Hawaii in my backpack to get those lava shots and waterfalls. Lightweight and easy to use.
1,Broke.,At first I was very happy with it.. but then after about 5 months it broke on me. Was happy with it up until that part.
4,Sunpak 620-020 Tripod,good tripod good price for small point & shoot cameraI use it occasionally on travel and easily put inside my luggage.
3,Ok tripod,"The head is not movable, plastic parts, hard to move around. BUt it is a good product for the price. As it is my first tripod, I guess I can't complain too much."
2,just a lil guy,"this is a smaller, more compact tripod than i was used to. i like it because it travels better but, fully extended its not as tall as my old dolica. i reach for the sunpak every time though.***Update****Just tossed it - the extension holders started breaking and the tripod is kind of worthless after that"
3,Worked good while it lasted...,"We'll I've owned and used the tripod for about two months now. Recently the leg has started to not hold weight. I contacted the store I bought it from and since it's out of the 30 days they won't do anything with it. Sunpac is sending me some felt pad to put inside the leg clamp which they said is removable, whiles it's actually riveted onto the leg. So now I'm stuck with a broken tripod and probably nothing being done with it..."
3,"It is a Tripod, but Not Worth It","This tripod was not worth my time or money. The only thing that it really was good for is holding my camera when I wasn't using it. It is very hard to adjust and does not have much variability.If you are taking straight forward pictures from a flat surface, this tripod will work for you. Any variability, such as uneven surfaces or fast set up shots, I would recommend spending a little bit more on your tripod. I wasted my time with this one, but I also take most of my pictures outside and end up with many variables. I have found that this tripod does not suit someone who plans to do more than work in controlled settings, like your living room."
1,Next time I'll buy B+W,This filter arrived with surface flaws near the edges. It seems to attract dust like a magnet and is nearly impossible to clean streak-free. I have not had these problems with B+W filters.
4,Lens was filthy inside sealed packaging,Of course who wants to spend 10 minutes getting dirt off a filter. That is what had to be done when removing the filter from its sealed packaging. this is the 2nd Hoya filter we had to do this with. Quality product once cleaned and installed. Hoya should ensure packaging is tighter as filter was loose in sealed packaging
4,A decent sense of being Virginia Reed,As much of this story is based on clips from Mrs. Reeds diary and letters to family; I felt the triumphs and tribulations of her family and friends throughout the entire book.I enjoy the point of view from the author and do recommend this book for a very strong understanding of what happened along the entire way to Ca. not simply focusing on time between November thru March.
5,A great book,I saw this at the local library and decided to check it out. It is a fascinating store about the Donner Party it is written for a great audience. It is acceptable for all ages.I would really recommend this book to anyone that wants to know more about the Donner party.
1,SUNPAK 040C Not Compatible w/Digital Cameras,"I didn't want to rate this flash so low, because I never got a chance to use it. It is not compatible with digital slr cameras, but I got it during my early stages of buying ""everything"" for my camera.The seller refunded me, and agreed that it should have been made clear that this flash is only for 35mm/non-digital slr cameras.If you were buying this flash for your digital slr, I just saved you time, and hear ache."
2,Least favorite NM ghost town book,"Great research on some towns but below mediocre on others. On towns the author didn't research well, she included a lot of dribble on the weather of the day she visited, her personal opinion of the town, landscape and people and even an issue with her car. At times the author's personal opinion was rude and offensive.My coworkers and I read aloud from a handful of NM ghost town books while in the truck traveling to remote research sites. We enjoy the stories in this book the least. When we arrive to a new town and read from this book, the group groans and grumbles making predictions on what rude opinion this author will offer. It's always a surprise when we like her story. Our favorite NM ghost town book - Ghost towns and mining camps of NM, 1975, by James and Barbara Sherman. It has better pictures and stories and is exceptionally well researched."
4,No Fur Elise,How can this be called the complete Beethoven bagatelles when Fur Elise is missing? That's the most famous bagatelle Beethoven composed. Other than that the album is great. But they shouldn't mislead the public by calling it complete when it isn't.
4,A Little Gem of a Novel,"Perhaps not as psychologically compelling and taut as some of Zweig's other work, this novella is still worth reading for it's fine writing. At a hotel in Monte Carlo in the days after World War I, a group of wealthy travelers are shocked to learn that a married woman of their set has suddenly left her husband and family on the arms of a seducer whom she has known less then twenty-four hours. Each guest chimes in with their opinion of the woman's extraordinary behavior. Our narrator expresses his understanding of the woman's actions while the others vehemently condemn the lady. Suddenly he finds himself the confidante of an older woman who is in the group. She tells him the tale of how twenty years earlier she too had been drawn to an intense younger man who she observed in the casino one evening. Zweig explores the motivations and the ramifications of a sudden act of passion."
2,dissapointing,"I was looking for more information on healthy nutrition for vegetatarian children. This book offers information on attitudes toward vegetairan families and a few nice recipes, but no basic nutrition information. If you're looking for a book to comiserate with your woes of people misunderstanding your wish to raise your child as a vegetarian, then this is the book for you. If you wish to learn about vegetarian nutrition for children, then try Sharon Yntema's books - they are great !"
2,disappointing,"I expected more information on vegetarian nutrition & recipes. Though this book presents some of the social obstacles of a living as a vegetarian with children, it offers little in the way of solutions to obstacles - just ""arguments"" for ""defending"" vegetarianism. If you wish to argue & defend, you should read this book. Education & information about sound vegetarian nutrition and reasons for living a peaceful vegetarian lifestyle are much better to help justify choices than the information that this book offers."
5,"informative, helpful reading",I really enjoyed this book. I've tried 5 or 6 of the recipes in the back and they are fantastic. It really helped get us out of the mealtime rut we were in. I recommend this book to any parent of vegetarian children.
5,EMT Holster Set,"The item was for a young friend of mune who was going to Army boot camp and the to medic school. The item was exactly what I wanted for Matt. I did a lot of research to get the best price, as the item was available at a lot of sources. I used Pay Pal and the product was received well packed and very quick. This was a very good experience."
1,don't buy!!!,"I recently purchased this seat for my son. It takes forever to get the cover off to wash it. You have to unscrew a number of parts. The tether strap is a terrible design. You have to thread it through a certain way or it doesn't hold. I have yet to figure the ""right"" way even following the pictures in the manual. Also the latch does not hold the seat as tight as I would like, but the seatbelt does."
4,Halfback Though,Halfback tough for the most part was a very good book. The only bad thing was that it was very drawn out at times and went on and talked about nothing. As far as football goes it was good at explaining what was going on in the game. Its a book worth reading.
4,Halfback Tough,Will Joe turn his act around at his new school. This book starts out slow but it goes on like this Joe the main character does not do very well in school. At his school he was known as a tough guy. He also did bad things like smoke and drink with his friends named Marty and Richard. Also he did not have a good relationship wit his parents and did better in school. I really enjoyed this book because Thomas Cygard made me feel like I was the main character in certain areas like when he did not do well in school and he turned around a did better in school just like me.
5,Best costume ever!!!,"Loved, loved, loved this costume. Very nicely made with tons of detail!!! Would highly recommend this costume. Received so many compliments :)"
4,Great costume!,This was an AMAZING halloween costume for my 5 year old! He loved it! The details were awesome and the hat was really authentic! The only bad thing about it was that the belt didn't stay on very well had to pin it to make it stay. But over all it was great.
4,"Great costume! Accessories, not so much ...","My 7-year-old absolutely loves his new police uniform. Halloween? Who wants to wait for Halloween to dress up like a cop and throw your little brother in ""jail?"" Not my kid. He hasn't taken his ""real police uniform"" off except to go to school, sleep, and bathe since it arrived a week before Halloween. The shirt, pants and hat have held up to everything he's dished out, and look nice and very realistic. The belt, however, was junk, and so was the whistle. Both broke immediately."
3,Dont like returns,I Purchased this item for my 5 year old son. He just got it today and really enjoying it. However when he put it on he lost the button on the pocket I fixed it as he went to play with his whistle The shoulder button fell off. Of course he dont care about buttons I am feeling some type of way because I paid enough for this costume that the buttons should stay on at least the first day. Now how do I tell this child I have to return his costume that he simply has fallen in love with.
5,Excellent,Good value. Our grandson was more than delighted. i would recommend this item to all. Good quality fabric and embroidery.
4,Great Quality,My son has wore this cop suit over and over again. Very unlikely with Halloween costumes but this one is a good one!
5,We like it!!,The suit is adorable! Ordered it for a school program. Our son has been playing dress up with it around the and loves it!
5,The most realistic out there,"I searched high and low for a good, quality police costume for my daughter. She wants to be the jailer and for her father to be her ""prisoner."" All of the Halloween stores are asking $25 for what I consider a poorly-made rag that does not include any accessories. This costume is not in the same ballpark as other ones I have seen. It is made of real material unlike the Halloween store costume material that is just a notch thicker than panty hose. It is a sturdy polyester with actual embroidery. The hat has structure that makes it stand up well and has adjustable Velcro in the back to get the perfect fit. I like that the front has Velcro all the way down. The buttons are just decorative. Overall I am very pleased to have found a reasonably priced costume that will stand up to more than one wearing on Halloween. I would buy this one again in a heartbeat."
5,Just Like Daddy,"Our son always wants to be like Daddy, now his uniform is relatively close to his and is having so much fun pretending to be Daddy."
4,Nice costume - bit fragile,"My son loves this costume and it is very handsome and easy for him to put on - elastic trousers and velcro top. The hat is so adjustable the baby, 4 yr old and myself can all fit in it. Only set back is that the belt has broken already - day 3. I am pretty sure I can sew the buckle back on. Perhaps it is not to be helped, I would not expect the costume to be indestructible."
3,Police costume,My son loves the outfit but the belt is very cheap and doesn't stay in place. It would be great of the belt were different
1,a big disappointment,"I bought this because so many people gave it good comments. BUT, the costume turned out to be a big disappointment. The quality of the material is poor and bad stitching. The material feels like it is going to be torn anytime when the child moves about. When the costume arrived, you could see the edges e.g. sleeves fraying. I would have sent it back and asked for refund if I stayed in the US. And the big white words 'POLICE' on the back of the costume looks awful. :("
3,Great dress up toy!,My son LOVES this costume...he spends hours playing in it! The only gripe we have is that the belt does not hold tight enough to attach any gear to it!
1,Smiles lasted only one day,"The initial impression was good...and my son loves it...however, the whistle, belt and holster, and handcuffs broke within the first day and by evening I was stitching seams that had come apart. The material frays easily, so the repairs aren't very pretty either."
4,Good Deal,Just as advertised. Good deal. Came promptly and wrapped securely. Product as expected in both quality and presentation. Very satisfied with purchase.
4,An excellent use for vampire games,"Although Werewolves are not something that any vampire wants to see, a Storyteller can often use them to stir up a campaign. This book has rules that make it easy to both create and properly role-play werewolves, or the lupines, as the licks like to call them.Either way, these 10 foot tall terrors should make anyone afriad. Very, very afraid."
3,Not as good as people say it is,"This was an OK book on Fish, but it was not great. I honestly don't know if I learned anything new about Fish. I might have learned a few new things about his killings, but despite how chilling and gruesome they are, you can imagine him doing almost anything gruesome if you already know stuff about him. If you are new to Fish, then this is the book you are looking for (unless you have a weak stomach of course), but if you already now a lot on him, then stay away from this book because you will not learn anything new."
3,Deranged:The Shocking True Story Of America's Most Fiendish,"This book was entertaining,but be prepared for a history lesson on specfic days of trial.There are two chapters of historical facts that have nothing to do with Albert Fish other than the date.But it was a good book."
5,Wow....that's it....unbelievable,"Amazing....i have read many crime books, non-fiction, and fiction; nothing comes close to the content of this book. if this was fiction, it would seem too crazy, to far fetched to actually believe that something so grotesque could actually happen. But, it is true and truly disturbing. Must read."
4,"What, exactly, was Albert Fish?","If everything in Schechter's book can be taken at face value, Albert Fish was not just a serial child murderer, but exhibited every known sex perversion and a few unique to himself. However, I have deep reservations about just how crazy Fish was. Essentially everything about Fish's psychological quirks comes from one source, the notorious Dr. Frederick Wertham. Wertham was a gullible, naive pseudoscientist whose absurd antics in the early 50s are well-known. Since Fish rarely told the truth about anything, and virtually nothing can be reliably documented about him beyond a few anecdotes from family members, and since his only chance of saving his life was an insanity plea, I am extremely unconvinced that Fish was quite as incomparably weird as he made out. Apart from that this is one of Schechter's usual good jobs of research. His real ""find"" was the lawyer who defended Fish, who provided a large amount of detailed, ""inside"" info about Fish's trial."
2,"A promising subject, but a very unsatisifying book","I've been looking for a book about Albert Fish ever since I learned of his existence. A religiously-inspired, senior citizen canibal who professed to have practiced every deviancy in the book should make a very interesting subject. Unfortunately,""Deranged"" by Harold Schecter is nowhere as interesting as I hoped. Too much time is spent on the investigation and the dozens of false leads that produced absolutely nothing. (About half the book is seemingly concerned about false leads.) And when the book is finished, Albert Fish, a man who kidnapped, cooked and ate a little girl and then wrote a letter to her parents to tell them how delicious she was, seems less like the embodiment of absolute evil and more like a pathetic old man who can't control his impulses. Perhaps the material wasn't nearly as interesting as it first appeared, but a subject this lurid shouldn't produce a book this boring."
2,Slow start,"Very slow start. The story takes place in the 1920's... didn't like the story, had to fight to finish it."
1,Boring,I am glad to see I am not alone. I quit half way through. The first half was somewhat interesting but it just went on and on.
4,Uck! Albert Fish was beyond sick,"There were parts of this story that made me physically sick to my stomach. Albert Fish was the sickest, most depraved serial killer I've ever read about. Not only the things he did to his helpless victims, but the things he did to himself, and his nasty habits were almost too much for me. If you have a weak stomach, you may want to pass this one up. It's a fast read, and interesting throughout, but gross as can be."
4,Deranged: revealing but slightly unsatisfying.,"Albert Fish was a compelling giant in the realm of perversion.In Schechter's book he is revealed as the complete nutjob, well-versed in every exhisting act of depravity and a pioneer in those previously unknown.However, Schechter spends too little time examining the family and personal history of the man/monster, and too much time dealing with the trivial details of his arrest.The few anecdotes revealed about Fish's family are informative and tantalizing, and I wish Schechter would have shared more information of this kind.Perhaps such revalations about his crazed clan would lead to a better understanding of Fish's proclivities.But Schechter's book is an easy read, not devoid of humor, and it plainly illustrates the depths to which a man can plummet."
5,Positively Yummy!,"Ah, Albert Fish! The Supreme American Sadist! The Inspiration for the cannibalism in Hannibal. A Pervert Extraordinaire who enjoyed sticking pins in his groin and considered the electric chair the ""Supreme Thrill"". In the realm of Serial Killer Lore, you just can't find many killers as fascinating as this one. He really set the standard for the Dahmers and Cholenko's of the world to follow. And this is an excellent summation of his ""career"" - written again by the imminently readable historian Harold Schechter. A most fascinating read."
3,The Werewolf of Wisteria...,"I had to read a book about a serial killer for my forensics class and this was the only one that seemed to have an in-depth look in Albert Fish's life. The beginning was slow and quite boring. It barely mentioned Fish. When it finally did talk about him, it was very detailed... Reading about all the gruesome things that Albert Fish had done gave me a few nightmares, especially because he looked normal on the outside, but he was fighting some seriously scary demons on the inside. The photographs at the end of the book were interesting to look at, and I'm glad that they added them to to the kindle version of the book.It's not exactly a biography but it's the most detailed source of information about Albert H. Fish (and his victims) that I have found so far."
5,Awesome workout!,"This workout is working great for me! Its hard, but I'm already noticing results & so are others when they see me. Good buy!"
2,Not helpful,"If you want to learn some technique, this book lacks details and is not useful. For beginner to intermediate instruction on in-line skating, I recommend instead the book by Liz Miller ""Get Rolling ..."", complemented by the one by William Nealy, ""Inline! ...""."
3,Annoyingly picks up dirt,"I thought I liked the concept but I found upon using it 1) I don't like that the screen isn't protected better and 2) the funny rubber attracts every bit of fuzz and food and dirt and whatever. I cleaned out my purse (I have a 2 year old, so cracker residue is not uncommon) and it still seems to attract every bit of whatever that is in the bottom of my purse. I HATE that! It's nasty and has to be wiped off. I know, you're thinking ""just clean your purse"". I did and I swear it's pulling it out of the air. So beware! Go with leather or something. It just feels nasty. And why do I need two of them anyway? Kinda a waste if you ask me. I do like the extra screen protectors, though."
4,Good and ok,"The flexi case for the Palm Z22 is great. Makes me feel more secure about decreasing damage if I drop it. The screen protectors are necessary, esp. if you keep the palm unprotected in your purse, but look like a low tech solution."
4,A nice option,I read the reviews carefully before picking out a case for my Zire 22. I like the feel of these in my hand. I have had no problem with it picking up lint as other people suggested. Maybe part of growing older and not having children's snacks in my purse is a good thing. I do wish that a color choice was available and I didn't need two cases unless they don't wear well. I'll know that later and then have to use a blue case. I don't like blue that well. I know that is picky but color matters and if I had to buy two of these things I would like to choose the color. This is a good case and I do recommend it.
2,Disappointed,This product arrived in the stated time span.It did not have the screen protectors that were noted.Disappointed as the case was difficult to work around.Do not use any more and did find a replacement plastic case that protects product better
4,speaker muffled,"Overall, I like this product. The soft case slips on pretty easily and allows access to all of the buttons and ports- including the reset button on the back. The texture will keep the device securely in a pocket, but allows me to pull it out firly easily. It also stays in place pretty well on a desk while I use it. There is also a little cushioning in case I drop my Z22 or have it banging against my knee in a cargo pocket. The main downside I see is that it muffles the speaker more than I would like. Sometimes I end up missing my reminders because of that. I also can't figure out why it came in a package of 2 and has so many screen protectors in the case."
4,A good investment,This case is a good investment if you use your palm pilot regularly. It keeps it from getting funky!
1,Excessive,$9 shipping for a $12 item seems a bit excessive for something that only weighs a few ounces.
3,Great at first...but something isn't right.,"I like these cases but I think that there's something wrong with them. I've used the clear case for almost a year. I recently removed the clear case from the Palm Z22 and the back of the case is turning brown...a burned shade of brown. I don't know what happened to it or if anyone else has experienced this, but my first initial thought looking at it made me think it could overheat the Z22. I don't want to ruin my Palm over something that costs less than $10."
3,"Does its job, but...",Pros:- Fits like a glove.- Rubbery casing allows your Palm to bounce rather than crash on the floor.Cons:- Traction of the rubbery material makes it difficult to put and take the Palm out of your pocket. So eventually I stopped using it. In practice the Palm Z22 is not really that fragile.
3,TTC - I am very confused,"I want to purchase the `Things To Come' DVD. Amazon offers 4 versions (Colorized, Rental, 2/27/2001 version, and Metropolis / Things To Come). The reviews for these items are all over the place and in some cases repeated, verbatim, for different versions. I am confused = which version is of the best quality????"
2,"No, See the Restored Metropolis Instead","I can't think of any reason, other than specialized scholarship, why anyone would ever watch the unrestored version of Metropolis, ever. The restored version (with the original soundtrack) is superior in every way to the butchered cut that circulated for decades after the film was originally released.And you do want to see Metropolis and Things to Come. They are both brilliant works of great artistic and historical value.Even if you are dirt poor, borrow superior copies from your local library rather than buy this disk. The only person I can think of who ought to buy this disk is an elementary or high school history teacher who wants to have a copy of Things to Come on hand, so students can better understand what people feared and hoped for in the years leading up to the Second World War."
4,Small but they work,Wow.. I really didn't read the specs I guess. I just assumed they would be bigger but... They do their job so that's good. They'll take up less space on the wall of my trailer or whatever box you might put them in when the trailer is hooked up or moving. Since they are solid rubber they have a little weight to them. String is plenty long enough for large tires too.When I say solid that's not 100% accurate.. The bottom of the chock set that they don't show is hollowed out a little but doesn't affect performance. I was saying the rubber is solid and not like the hollow plastic ones that I have had in the past.
5,Must-read for Internet investors,"Before you even think of wandering into an Internet chatroom or message board looking for stock advice, read this book. It will help you interpret what is going on, understanding people's motivations and discovering the bits of truly useful information that may be out there.This is far more than just an investment guidebook, however. It takes you through the real-life misadventures of a dot.com company, weaving a tale too tragic to be invented.Stranger than fiction, for sure, but wasn't most of the dot.com boom?"
5,Don't venture in to stock chat boards without reading this!,"I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this book. In fact, I thought it might be aimed too much at the newbie investor.However, I was pleasantly surprised in that it helped me round out my understanding of not only how to determine the useful from the merely entertaining in the chat rooms but also what went wrong with so many companies during the dot bust era.I won't spoil the surprise at the end but it caught me off guard and also rounded out the story quite well.My only complaints were that I hoped the author would have given a bit more inside information about what was going on at the company and that it was shorter than I hoped. I read it fairly quickly and it left me wanting more - perhaps there's a sequel in the works ;-)"
1,Simply put it stinks,"I have red this book and to put it simply it stunk. with out going into any detale, it was already said. I have been a outlanders fan from the begining, and a deathlands fan since the 3rd book. I no longer read Deathlands because of shody authors, and this will be my last book in the outlander series that is not written by Mark Ellis. Simply said if Mark Ellis didn't write it don't read it. Gold Eagle Books PLEASE PLEASE wake up and smell the coffie before it is too late. You are letting thease two once great series get flushed down the drain, with lousey writing."
4,My personal Gateway Drug,"This book ruled. This was the first science-fiction book I ever bought, and I'm sorry to see it's out of print. When I bought it the first time, it was already older than me.Summary: Unwitingly abondoned by his parents, Mykl is stranded on a hostile planet, from which escape sems impossible.More in depth summary: Well, he's on this planet, which is a planet that gets mined off of all the time. Y'see, his parents are space miners, and this planet's a gold mine, but the only problem is that there's these things that eat metal here and, you guessed it, they haven't invented plastic space ships yet. So in thier hurry to leave, they accidentally leave Mykl there. And this dwarf girl who was a hired hand. And there they hang out at this cool dome thing with a robot named Ego.A badical book. Not much now for me, but I think it's badical because of sentimentality. Get it for the kid in your life. You'll be glad you did."
4,"Great quick meal, but it can't be reheated","These are great for a quick meal for our son, however they can't be reheated. Upon reheating these they turn to mush. My son seems to love the taste of these and thinks of them more as a treat than a normal meal :). I would buy these again, but if your child is not as hungry as you anticipated, count on throwing these out right away."
4,Good value but,"I purchased this tripod because I wanted something lightweight for travel that would work with my Canon Rebel Digital SLR, and my Canon G2. It seems to have many of the features I was looking for at a price I was wanting to pay. I had a great deal of trouble opening the quick release lever for the first time. I had to losen the screw, and spray a bit of WD40 on the lever's spring. In the process I made a few scratches on the plate. Once I was able to open the lever, everything seemed to work smoothly.One feature I would have liked to see on it is a level."
3,Still photo only.,"When I ordered this tripod, I was hoping for one that would do double dudy as a still tripod and a video tripod for my miniDV camera. It works fine for still photography, but the handles are not long enough and the pan and tilt are no where near smooth enough for video work."
4,Good Reading- Not For Historical Reference But Great Laughs,"I always enjoy a good laugh and this book just hits the spot. Im not a fan of the guy's pictures (I dont think he was particularly gifted as a photographer on the context of journalism) but I think he is a great writer. In person he is a bit of a showman. Very flamboyant.Its not a good reference for accurate historical events on account that they guy was stoned all the time. But the details speaks so true of the region, the people and the oddball circumstances that can only happen in Indochina.He definitely has a way with words. One rival photographer from his generation even said that he should just pursue writing and leave photography to those who can focus their lenses."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"The original extended version of 'Fascination' is truly awesome, and the entries from Thomas Dolby, Talking Heads, Spandau, Ultravox and Culture Club are more than worthy. The Duran Duran mix, while good, has been available on disc for many years in many places. Billy Idol's 'Flesh For Fantasy' is even more widely accessible. The 1993 mix of a great Heaven 17 song is simply awful. Blondie's 'Atomic' from 1994 raises the question-- why didn't the people behind this disc put in a little more effort? The remix edit of the wonderful Simple Minds track 'Waterfront' is nothing short of an insult. The 2001 version of 'Kids In America' has been included as an exhibit of the failure of imagination that plagues today's remixers (it couldn't be there for reasons of quality because it has none). Why not dig deeper and get out some of the good stuff released AT THE TIME? It wouldn't have been too much of a chore, and it would've lived up to the title of the disc."
3,Mean,I thought a mean little book and few in colour. Why not larger like all the other Bateman books produced over the years?
5,david mulkey,"I hope this is only the begining for Barry Mason. The book Maroon is both exiciting and spell binding. With 15 years of police experience in both the patrol and detective bureaus, I found Maroon to be extremely entertaining and well written. I throughly enjoyed the book from beginning to end and I hope there is more to follow. Anyone with an interest in investigations and suspence should get this book as they will find it impossible to put down until they have finished reading the entire book. Barry Mason did an outstanding job on this book and I hope he will continue with more books of this nature. Well done."
4,A B2B Complex Sales Book,"This is a great B2B, complex sale type of book for individuals and companies looking to establish a process/methodology for improving sales and getting consistent results.Why not Five Stars? I've been in sales many years and have read countless sales book. That said, many of the concepts and models outlined in the book aren't new, just a different take (perspective) or twist on them which I enjoyed and which warranted at least 4 stars! For experienced B2B salespeople who've been formally trained in the complex sale, the material will look familiar.Who should buy this book:- If you're B2B product (service) requires understanding a complex sale scenario.- Or, If you're new or fairly new to B2B sales, this book is a GREAT investment.- Or, if you're a veteran and need some refresher material; I highly recommend it.Note: The book contains 11 useful worksheets/planners that make purchasing the book worth it."
1,"Cute, Adorable, and utterly useless","I bought two of these with the idea that redundency in emergency supplies was prudent. I have flash lights and a battery lantern so these two little items seemed a cheap back up if the batteries fail. They do not put off enough light to read braille by! Save your money and either buy a LED battery lantern and buy extra batteries, or buy an oil lamp. These are a joke!"
5,"I think ""Mind Power"" is","This book is absolutely wonderful reading. It is helpful, insightful, and practical. I have learned a lot from it and enjoy thinking about what I've read and coming back again to reread some things for better understanding. Good book!"
4,A must-have for your library,"What can one say that hasn't been said about this book and the work of John? This is a great read and stands on its own as one of the all-time classics in this particular genre. In my opinion there are only a half dozen or so success based books required for your personal library, and this is one of them! Well worth reading."
5,Required Reading,Required reading for those who choose to be responsible for their thoughts and what they create in every area of their lives.
2,No New Info - A Mishmash Rehash of Old ideas,"I fail to see why there are so many rave reviews. All this is is a break down of other peoples techniques and ideas. There is a small chapter on affirmations, dreams, intuition, visualization, beliefs, etc. There is no plan on how to use the techniques at all. I recommend Wayne Dyer. Any of his books will give you a much better plan on how to improve your life"
2,Not as good as River Plate,"This is the directors cut with ""Re-mastered video and audio"", but I thought the quality of the video was very grainy, and the sound even in 5.1 does not pack as much of a punch as River Plate."
2,Didn't work with my 1080p monitor,When I used this cable to connect my Dell Latitude E6410 to aViewsonic VA2231WM-LED 22-Inch Widescreen LED Monitor1080p monitor I got severe flickering and discoloration--a totally unusable picture. The monitor/laptop combo works fine with other VGA cables.When I used this cable to connect to a monitor at 1440x900 it worked fine. I think the quality just isn't high enough for the bandwidth needed for 1080p.
1,defective,"Screen shows a bluish/green tinge when using cable. Only pressing one end towards the cable hear will allow you gain clean, decent output. I ended up slogging to the local compuwarehouse shop, something I'd had been trying to avoid, and bought a generic cable for about $12. It works, which is more than I can say about this one. One positive point: the cable seems to be solid enough to use as some avant garde belt.Useless. Don't bother. Stay Away."
2,Problem with ghosting.,"I purchased this item based on the good reviews, however, the cable is causing pronounced ghosting. Swapping to other cable confirmed this. This must mean that they have poor product quality control and are unable to produce consistent quality."
5,Works well,"The cable arrived earlier than expected. It works well. However, for those who want to use their laptop while watching TV, I would recommend a cable longer than 6ft."
2,no screw slots for tightening....,"....making it extremely difficult to tighten this cable in tight spots, i.e., the backs of most monitors, which adds stress to the port/pins. Metal shielding also arrived bent and looks flimsy. The cable is otherwise heavy and thick, making a good first impression, but overall quality of material and design is lacking."
4,A fine laptop -> hdtv cable,"This cable is fine. It does the job well, and is well worth the $6.19 I paid for it. The cord is a little more 'stiff' than another one I tried, so it looks like it sticks out of the laptop when I connect it to the HDTV, but the signal and connection are great. No problems."
2,Did not give the quality desired,"Upon using this cable, I encountered ghosting all over my screen. The cheap(er) looking cable that came with my monitor and my brother took from me worked many times better. I will be returning this and looking for something else.Also, the plugs are quite large so make sure your VGA input areas are free of obstructions, if you choose to buy it."
3,DID NOT FIT,I gave this cable a descent rating because it seemed to be a quality product but beware if you have a thinner led tv. This cable connection was too fat to hook up to my samsung led tv. So i am returning it and trying to find one that is a little narrower.
3,Not as expected,"Ok quality for that price. But if you looking for HQ resolution , then this is not the one."
1,Item is not as pictured.,"I ordered this cable because I needed a high quality cable without the 9-pin, which is what's pictured in the description. The cable I received was nothing like the one in the picture; it had the 9-pin, and was much flimsier overall. So don't buy this product based on the picture."
4,THE REAL Mystery???,"Gotta say....In the end, the biggest mystery remains: WHERE THE HECK WAS THE LOCATION? No one seems to know, or at least tell, where on Earth this series was shot! Looks like WA State, but could be Northern Cal, Oregon, or a zillion other places. Anyone know??Thanx!"
2,Studied the book 3 times and still failed the exam.,"I am a Certified Novell Engineer and Certified Lotus Notes Specialist who is no stranger to taking certification tests. However, I completely studied the book (reading, taking notes, and doing the examples) slogging through the inaccurate information 3 times to walk away from the failed test frustrated. This book needs a serious proofreader and a second opinion on its content."
3,"Very helpful in exam preparation, but too many errors","This book is definitely worthwhile in preparing for the exams. The author is easy to understand, gives easy-to-follow examples and covers the material needed to pass the test.Unfortunately, there are dozens of errors in the text and the errata posted on the website shows corrections for only a fraction of these. A revised edition correcting these errors is needed."
4,Great Book on Java Certification!,"Yesterday I became a Sun Certified Java 2 Programmer with the aid of this book. Although there are some syntax mistakes, I found the book well-written and the sample tests excellent barometers for the real exam. I would also recommend the Roberts-Heller book. Combined, they give a well-rounded, indepth approach to the language and the exam."
2,OK but not perfect,"I bought this book for the practice exams. I found them challenging and reasonable with respect to the actual 1.1 programmer's certification exam. There were a few typos in the exams, but nothing that I consider major. I found the CDROM not useful. An automated test engine that presented sample questions, even limited to the two practice exams, would have been welcome."
2,Tries to cover too much.,"Barry's setting out to climb a big mountain here and it's likely that publishing deadlines have seen him fall somewhat short of the mark. Most topics are covered in a very cursory manner leaving much of the detail to be provided by collateral reading or trial and error. He seems to have a lose grip on the >> operator and a couple of his examples are wrong. He doesn't cover the AND, OR and XOR family well (&, &&, |, ||, ^). Buy this book if you want a list of what's on the exam."
4,Save your $150.,I have just passed the Exam. This book is worth every page. The information about the test as well as the subject is of relevant context.This book has been a life saver to me.
2,Brief subject review but good practise tests,I started the book to prepare for the programmers certification but the errors and brief explanations made it necessary to refer other books to clear concepts. Good review questions and tests. Would recommend using this book for revision and not as primary preparation material.
3,Don't have a good way of writing a book,"I can tell that the author has a good knowledge of Java, and he is willing to share it with our readers. But too many icons make the book trivial. Error on page 147 (question 5). Many typos also."
1,Tread carefully with this book!,This book is so full of errors in critical areas of the programmers requirements that it will get a non seasoned programmer in trouble! There is a lot of wrong and misleading information that one should be very careful about. I took the exam using this book as my one source and narrowly failed! I would not recommend anyone using this book as their primary source.
1,Worst technical book ever read!,"The book is so full of errors, I'm certain that someone preparing for the programmers exam will fail, if this is the only reference source they use."
2,Poorly edited,"This book is in dire need of some editing. There are several blatant errors in the test questions and in the text. Aside from that, the material is well organized and covers everything you need to pass the test.I would recommend choosing the certification guide by Simon Roberts or waiting for the 2nd edition of this book."
3,This book covers all the important topics of the test.,The author should have covered the topics in more detail. However the tests of this book are very similar to the real test. If you can clear these tests with a reasonable margin you are sure to clear the real test.
3,"Not bad, but beware!","The content and depth are quite appropriate for the Programmer certification. However, there are a surprising number of typos and mistakes scattered through out the book. The two sample exams are quite representative of the real exam and provide excellent preparation material. It is sad that no real effort went into proofing this text, otherwise it would be an excellent book. Still, if you are confident that you can catch the mistakes/typos then this is a good source for exam preparation."
5,Best basic meter for the price,"I actually had this meter before and while I was learning and fooling around with DC I burnt it out. I looked at others in stores and didn't like what I saw. Thankfully Amazon had the exact model to order.I bought mine for $9.99. Including shipping. That's a deal.Meter has 2 different ports as a safety feature in order to distinguish between DC & AC. Nice big dial for my eyes in dark work areas. Smaller meters at a comparable price are harder to read and cannot read voltage above 250v. I've tested my 3 phase electricity with no problem. I didn't want a fancy digital model since I use this for household electricity, testing batteries, and working on cars. For $10 it's probably the best utilitarian all around meter I've seen. I didn't go for a newer model because if it ain't broke don't fix it."
1,Disgruntled Purchaser,I purchased this product and it failed in the first month. I mailed the product to the manufacturer and they mailed it back -unopened. Don't waste your time with this product. There is a good reason it is cheap. I guess you get what you pay for..
1,Pretty awful,"These things are really bad. I ordered two flavors and both are awful. I took a bunch to work and even when I'm starving, I can't bring myself to eat them. Maybe that's the best way to diet -- make them the only available food and you'll lose weight in no time!"
1,5 mo old puppy tore apart in 2 days,"My 5 mo old lab/terrier mix puppy liked this toy a lot, but within 2 days, he was able to rip into it such that the stuffing came out!"
3,"Great quality, but small is not small","the ""small"" size here seems to be 2 times the small sizes i'm familiar with."
5,great toy,"Perfect size for my 17lb Manchester/doxie mix. Not too much to say, just great toy that he likes to play with. I've had it for a month now and it hasn't been torn to pieces."
5,sheepskin tug,"This is Rigley's 4th sheepskin tug. It's his favorite toy! Although it is not made to withstand the torque of an 83 pound Golden Retriever on one end and husband on the other, it lasts as best it can. Even when it gets down to pieces it is still the first thing Rigley brings to us for play. There will always be a sheepskin tug in his toy box."
1,Sheepskin ball durability,"I purchased three of these, thinking they were like the similar sheepskin balls made by Vermont. Unfortunately, they are not even close in durability. Waste of money, at least for my lab because not one of the balls lasted more than a few minutes. I had one made by Vermont that lasted for weeks before it finally tore."
4,Ch-ch-ch-changes,"Changes is what life and what this how-do-book are all about. The lively writing and nuggets of do's and don'ts reflect the mid-life exuberance of parents starting a new phase of their lives without children at home. The advice rings bells for anyone going through changes. Anyone alive in the society of modern transience will find useful suggestions in thoughts like: Do not immediately go into the room of someone who has just moved away. Do not expect a returnee to behave like a resident. Appropriate activities for stress given by the authors include lists for the left- and right-brained, and how to discover your category. Left brainers, for example, should take a watch apart. My reason for reading the book was the category of distant relative and contemporary; my reason for finishing the book in two readings was enjoyment and applicability to a lifestyle that doesn't include children of my own. Thanks, literary mothers, for a short, fun book of changes."
2,Not helpful at all,"This book is neither funny nor informative. In fact it is super boring. It seems like the authors didn't have enough information on the subject, so it includes large type, a lot of pictures, and WAY to many stupid lists. If you truly need advice, due to being down about empty nest syndrome like I am, then keep looking as this book will not help."
1,"Don't buy ""133 Ways, etc""",For $43.00 this book isn't worth it at all. It is a paperback worth about $4.95 @ Borders!
1,No cover door!,I could not believe it that it does not come with a top cover. The pictures were deceiving. I think without cover you get all kinds of insects convene in there.Other than that it seems ok.
5,Fabulous,"I use these when I'm preparing meals days in advance. I can chop the veggies, measure the ingredients, or whatever and store them in these until I'm ready to make the meal. It saves a lot of time on those nights when I have no energy or ambition.These are also great to take to work because I can take anything, take the lid off and put the dish in the microwave."
5,A horror CLASSIC is BACK!!!!,"I loved THE BEAST WITHIN when I first read it in the early 80's. When I saw that it had been republished, I simply HAD to buy it and EXPERIENCE it all over again. It's WONDERFUL!!! If you enjoy nonstop horror that grabs you and holds you right from the first page, I certainly recommend THE BEAST WITHIN. My further advice is, if you like THE BEAST WITHIN as much as I did, be sure to get CAME A SPIDER (by the same author, Edward Levy). You won't be sorry!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A hillbilly religious nut isn't particularly nice to his wife, or to the thing that he keeps locked up. The combination of the two and a pregnancy will eventually cause very bad things to happen.A horror type novel full of some unpleasant things, and not really very good to go along with all of that."
5,Laugh Out Loud,"Unlike a lot of romance fiction, this quirky tale is full of laugh out loud passages and charming twists. Our heroine is wittier than most and the story enjoys breaking the more staid rules of lesbian romance fiction. Another great read from the mind and pen of Jennifer Fulton (aka Rose Beecham)."
3,Fell A Little Short,"As a coming of age story, i think this story was very well written. Chance is a hilarious character with a lot of problems that the audience gets to see her work out. However, as a love story... Chances love interest comes out of nowhere...no real development in their relationship...i really couldn't understand how they were in love. At the end i was still wondering who the heck Luke was and what made her so special."
2,Not good at all..,"I was hoping to save a bit of manoey getting this SILVERSTAR ULTRAS, trust me I have spent a lot in performance and lights for cars back then and getting this lightbulbs instead of HID KITS, I have brand new honda accord 2011, but still lightbulbs not worth it at all, waste of money, and 2 star for a bit brighter than oem ones, but would not recommend this items."
2,Bright but don't last,These headlights are quite bright and give a lot of light but they only lasted two months. I bought them from a local auto parts dealer for $50 and thought they might last a little longer than that. If you have a lot of extra money floating around for headlights every two months then go ahead and purchase but if not then choose something else.
3,very bright but not worthy to buy,"had been using so many light bulbs and this one is the brightest one (more far, more wide, and more bright). It evens wider and far than piaa intense white but it is so easy to burn out. the first pair burn out after 6 months (no DRL running). the second pair i think also gone less than a year. If you don't care the trouble to keep replacing it and $37 dollars less than a year, it is the bulb you need because even tho GE, piaa won't more wide and this long distance."
3,Not as good as advertised,"These were somewhat disappointing, not the brightness advertised but I will say the lighting to the right side of the road is wonderful."
2,THIS IS NOT TWO LOWBEAM HEADLIGHTS,Its actually one highbeam and one low beam. The one I recieved had one unit with two grooves and one with one groove. The groves designate which headlight port they are suppose to go in. The one on the right is a highbeam.
4,Nice lights great delivery,Great Lights much better night driving. I wish they lasted longer than 1 Year but otherwise I will buy again
5,LOVE....LOVE!,Wear gloves and dont touch the lamps and there is no issues with burning out. I love the crisp light they push out. I bought dims and brights for my 2012 Honda Civic. I did the drivers side and compared my factory stock to these and WOW!!!!! Huge Difference.
5,Easy install,"Just put in a set on my 2000 Buick Century. Easiest bulb in the world to change. All you do is pull up on the two plastic sticks that hold the light in, and it comes right out where you easily install it. Cant wait to try them after dark tonight."
3,both died in 6 month,"Bought those for my wife's Honda accord to replace the left side headlight bulb. first one died in 6 month, replaced with the second one from the pack, and it died in 7 month. The one on the right side from a different manufacturer is still going. My wife drives about 20 miles per day with lights always ""on"". Would not buy again."
1,Short life but bright light,I bought these lights to help see at night and they perform very well. But the back of the package says that they only perform about a quarter of the time the normal bulbs last. If I knew what it said on the back of the package I would have bought some HID conversion headlights. Live and Learn.
1,Very Short Life,"I liked the brighter, whiter light but not the SHORT life. One burned out in about 10 months.Update 10/2009: since they lasted less than a year, Sylvania sent me a new pair for free. These lasted 15 months. Better, but subpar. I still like the added benefit of the whiter, brighter light, I just wish for $35 they would last at least two years."
2,Sylvania Silverstar Ultra,"Compared to the regular SilverStar, the Silverstar ULTRA headlights were supposed to ""last up to 30% longer"". I have used the Silverstar in the past and decided to give the Ultra a try. They only lasted 6 months. I installed them in Dec. and they burned out in June, the left and right bulbs burning out within 2 weeks of each other. Their brightness and performance is great, but they just simply don't last as long as I think they should. Come on, at least last one year."
1,Waste of money and time. Burns out within a matter of months,"Nothing more aggravating then having to replace these bulbs twice in one year. The first time, is ok , maybe I just got a bad set, the second time one out of a set of these silverstar bulbs burned out, I got the cool blues instead. Hopefully I'll get longer lasting results with the cooler burning bulbs."
1,Relatively short life-expectancy,"I've purchased a pair of those SilverStar Ultra in January 2008. With minimal night-time driving and no daytime running lights feature to my vehicle, those headlight bulbs have gone out on me by December 2008 (total of less than 12 months of life-expectancy). In my opinion not very worth it considering its price, even though they are brighter than regular 9006 headlight bulbs. You could probably buy a pair of regular 9006 headlight bulbs which cost half the price, and they might last you at least 5 years or longer."
3,Noticable lighting improvement but longevity suffers,"I replaced the low beam lamps in our 2006 Toyota Highlander with the Sylvania Silverstars 14 months ago and they each have failed since then...within 3 weeks of each other. While the quality of brightness is noticable, I expect longer life. When I initially installed the new bulbs last year, I retained the 6 year old OEM bulbs, which I have reinstalled. My conclusion : The quality of ligting improves but expect them to last one sixth the time of the original bulbs in your car.... a significant cost if your car has daylight running lights."
1,Wrong headlight bulbs,"These bulbs did not fit my 2006 Toyota Tundra , my friend opened the pack which voided my returning them"
4,Bulb brightness and focus,The bulbs aren't as bright as I expected and the focus is different than my old bulbs. I made sure they were intalled correctly.
1,these head lights are the worst,i bought these head light thinking they are goin to be better then the old one i have they are just as bad may be even worst never again
3,visibility,The bulbs did improve night vision. It was not what I really expected. I replaced them with hid 9006 conversion kits and now I have 2 stars as headlights.
1,Failed first cold snap,"Loved how bright they where. First sustained cold snap in New England and one failed. The other came back to life after it warmed up, but obviously can't trust it. Would not recommend, went back to the Phillips OEM bulb."
2,Driving in the dark,"I have only had a few headlights burn out in 40 years of driving. They usually get dimmer and encourage replacement before they fry. These Silverstar Ultra bulbs both burned out at one year and a few days. They made nice light while they lasted, but it wasn't worth it to me with such a short life. I don't even drive that much at night, except during the darker months. The short life is unacceptable to me and I won't be using these again. It's too bad, because Osram was a top quality product once upon a time. PS, my Accord electrical system is performing exactly as it should."
3,gets the job done,i needed a new lamp so this one did the trick. it wasnt as bright as i had hoped though... oh well
2,bb: buyer beware,"great performance, but terrible durability. The 4th bulb in less than a year needs replacement. Quandry. Need the good lighting, but can't keep spending the money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!,"I just bought one and I am very disappionted.I looks just like a normal halogen lamp,nothing white about it or anything of that nature.I feel like i have been ripped off and cant return it because iI ripped the case and threw it away.I dont know why people give recommendations about how great this is and how white it is,unless I got a defective package, there is nothing ""xenon-looking"" about this.My high beams are of a different brand and you can just see how white with a blue tint that looks,I guess I shoul have bought that same brand again.What a waste of my money."
1,Don't expect them to last long,"Purchased these SilverStar Ultras approx.10 months ago. The first one died after 7 months and the second one died last night. They are nice and bright, but they have short life."
2,Bright...but not as bright as the claims,"These are fairly expensive at California auto part stores. On the front of the packaging, they claim ""up to 50% brighter, up to 40% more reach, and up to 50% wider."" However, the fine print on the back says that the claims were made when comparing these bulbs at 100% power to standard bulbs at 80% of power!!! How can this be a fair comparison? I thought U.S. laws were supposed to protect consumers from this type of deception.I have to 2005 Corolla CEs. When comparing these bulbs to the standard, I would say they about 20% brighter, 10-15% more reach, and 15% wider. Definitely not what they claim. I have had them only a few days, so I cannot comment on the longevity. However, standard bulbs easily last 2 years in or cars. After reading the comments on Amazon about longevity, I am a little worried that these won't last."
2,"Bright, Better than Halogen but very Short life!!!","I bought twin pack Silverstar Ultra, even better I got mail-in-rebate. I liked this product brighter, wider, longer than halogen.But after 10Month left one is gone. I used to use approximately headlight for 2 hours per week, it means very less.I have to say, stay away from this unless you're willing to exchange headlihgt every 6 month."
1,Waste of money,"These bulbs burn out faster than you can replace them!Tried these first in my 2003 Mazda 6, one went after ONE WEEK, the other about a month later. Decided to try them in my partners 2001 Honda Accord, same results. One lasted a month, the other lasted 3. Original OEM bulbs in both cars are still burning brightly.WASTE OF MONEY!"
3,"Whiter, but not as great!",The light is brighter but it seem that the beam isn't as far as I would like it to be. I still have a hard time seeing what in front of me.
1,Sylvania says Silverstars no better than new regular bulbs,"Read the Silverstar Ultra package. ""Headlamps dim over time by 20% or more and timely replacement results in increased lighting performance. Claims based on measured comparisons between SilverStar Ultra product family AT 100% LIGHT OUTPUT and standard halogen bulbs AT 80% LIGHT OUTPUT."" (Emphasis mine).So the new SilverStars are 20% better than OLD regular halogen bulbs. Big deal. New regular halogen bulbs are also 20% better than old halogen bulbs.At least I only paid 20 bucks for them on eBay. Next time, back to regular bulbs, same light benefits, less cost!"
2,Not what I thought...,These headlights did not meet my expectations. I don't think they are any brighter than my old headlights which were the cheapest ones I could find. The expected lifetime on these bulbs are only a year. If I could go back I would have just bought the cheap ones again.
1,Rip Off - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME& MONEY,Title says it all. Extremely short life. Be wise never buy this item. We live in eastern US where it is cold and thinking that Sylvania is a big name and the product would last at least for 2- 3 years and not bother replacing. Failed within 5-6 months Brands don't matter!
2,Bulbs don't last,I purchased these bulbs for my 2003 explorer in Mid August of 2011. Its now Feb 2012 and I've been noticing they aren't as bright. My stock bulbs were brighter and lasted longer compared to these. The reason I was focused on buying the bulbs in the first place was because they were cheaper than Walmart or any auto store in my area. Stores had the same bulbs priced in the $50 area and amazon had them for $35. They are decent bulbs when they you first get them they lose the brightness fast.
