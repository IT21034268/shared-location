2,Not carefree,"I just finished dismantling the humidifier to clean it. There was definitely mold. The humidifier isn't bad. In fact, it works just fine. The filter is made of metal, which you can spray off in the sink or soak in water with a little bleach. I'm just disappointed in the false advertising."
5,Beautiful Strings and Chet,"No jazz artist exceeds Baker's work on this great album. Song after song showcases the singing and trumpet mastery of one of America's most sensitive artists. There is not much missing from the musical journeys that Chet takes cut after cut. Like the great old favorites? You'll love them here, and some new things as well. Classic Baker at his very best."
2,Impractical for reading,"Small font, to much text... Tehnicaly speaking, this book is in general impractical for reading... U can't put it in front of you and read, it is imposible. You must hold it if you want to read."
2,Tibetan energy yoga,Video did not hold my interest at all. Was just flat not interesting in aspects of yoga or Tibetan Buddhism. Bummed me out as I have liked most of the Lama Surya Das books I have read.
5,Fantastic 3D Realism,"From the turquoise paw prints to the 3D Wolf, there is not one thing that is not beautiful. I put this sterling ring on and have not taken it off. The compliments on it's beauty and uniqueness are common."
5,Nostalgia rules,"The first time I heard this album was in my Godfathers house, the tune I loved the most was the ""theme to a summer place"". I liked the film as well even though I saw it after I heard the soundtrack. There's really good 50's and early 60's rockabilly and doo wop tunes on this. Highly recommended is the original version of the Summer place theme. This pops up in a slightly different form on other compilations, not nearly as good."
4,fun,"I love to listen to this c.d. It's been the only c.d. in my player for a week now. Many songs are fun, upbeat songs to sing to. Some are slower and soothing. Many I can relate to and are uplifting. I love to sing along with her. Love the clarity of her voice. The words in the songs always speak to me in some manner. A good c.d. all around."
3,"Well... the title song is heavily inspired by Anggun, or ... ?","I ask you to listen to a song by Anggun called ""Undress Me"", then to the title track of this CD, and tell me they do not sound ""similar"" ?Speaking of, let's listen to ""Un Lugar Celestial"" by Jaci Velasquez, or to ""Rette Mich"" by Tokio Hotel. I wonder if people are out of new melodic ideas anymore ...?3 stars for an ok voice :)"
4,A Good Debut Album,"Rachel Lampa is a great young singer with plenty of talent and love for God. Her CD, Live for You is a great debut album. The title track is a great song that expresses her love for the Lord. The various songs on the album each bring the feel of a different style. Nowhere is that more evident in the song ""Day of Freedom"". The Middle Eastern flair to this track is really great. You will find yourself singing these tunes again and again. The CD is also an enhanced CD that will play some multi-media presentations when you play it in your computer (although I really dislike the auto-start feature). There are various interviews with Rachel that provide some insight into this young singer. Pick this one up today, you won't be sorry!"
5,Talent that will bridge the gap,"Never since Amy Grant blew onto the pop music charts has there been a Christian rocker with the potential to blow the doors off of the industry. In the days of teenage singers selling sex and throwing foul language on the radio and in the ears of my children, it is refreshing to have such a pure, unadulterated and beautiful voice on the scene. I'm an instant fan -- I can hardly wait for her next album (though I suspect we'll have to wait until next summer's school break!)."
5,Playin it since I got it,"Love it, love it love. Every single song. This album is a must have for anyone. Rachael Lampa can sang, chile!"
4,Wow! This is Hot~~,"This CD is the bomb!! Actually one of the best Christian CD's our there. Not that every song is great, but it has so many awesome songs. This CD will make you dance!!(4.2/5.0)MUST LISTEN-Day Of Freedom, Live For You, God Loves You, You Lift Me Up, Shaken1. Day Of Freedom - (9/10)2. Live For You - (9/10)3. Always Be My Home - (6/10)4. God Loves You - (9/10)5. Blessed - (7/10)6. You Lift Me Up - (10/10)7. Shaken - (9/10)8. Free - (7/10)9. Hide Me - (6/10)10. Secret Place - (8/10)11. My Father's Heart - (6/10)"
5,Rachael Lampa (Live For You),"Superb vocals, excellent music production. This young lady is on fire for God and I love to see artist do the real thing. As a music artist myself, we share the same mission. This is a must have CD, I bought it as soon as I heard about it. Get this CD you will love it. God bless you RL."
4,Australian Classic,"A film that will remind Australian baby boomers of how it was & educate gen Y & Xer's. It will delight viewers from elsewhere who are not familiar with Australia or her history. A great cast of prominent actors including the venerable Bill Hunter & Brian Brown. It cleverly uses actual Black & white news footage incorporated into the story which is about 2 cinema news companies (pre T.V.), one Australian the other American, in competition with one another covering events in Australia & screening film of overseas events that have been flown in, probably days after the event. (how the world has changed)."
5,Great Great Great!,I got this for my 30 year old boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! He has watched the whole thing through twice now! I find it hillarious too! Great for kids and adults!
5,Hilarious,"Thisnis a fun cartoon and a great show. It looks to be a simple kids' show, but really is for a older audience. References to classic literature and such are in here (such as Dune or Lord Byron)The story is about two kids who trick Death into being their friend, and this leads to fun mishaps. Mandy is brilliant and borderline evil while Billy is her complete opposite - stupid and while not necessarily 'good' as opposed to evil, he is very innocent due to his stupidity. The Grim Reaper has to deal with both of them, and since Billy and Mandy are so different, it makes for some great and funny episodes."
2,West Recorder,I purchased 25 of the West recorders and each one plays slightly sharp...this is a huge deal when combined with recorders that play in tune.
2,james brown,"typical jb album;all the songs(except 'regrets',which is why i bought it)are on at least 15 other albums...save your money!"
2,4yo and still meh,"I got this game pad about 4 years ago (07-2007, now) around $8 and I've used it exclusively for SNES emulation with zsnes. It does okay. Currently I'm finding that the placement of the buttons is a bit off and I often hit two keys at once. I did not have this problem nearly as badly when I first bought it as I am now. Despite appearances, The arrow pad is not analog and the little joy stick sticking out of it is detachable and has a clever but clumsy slot between the two handles to store it. I STRONGLY discourage anyone from buying this product for even mildly serious gaming. It's hardly acceptable for SNES emulation and could be adequate NES emulation."
1,horrid,Absolutley no good for online competetive gaming.Even with a game like mk1 i wind up jumping wheni do not want too. Better to save up and buymayflash arcade stick or just get a usb converter.
1,"Poor quality, restocking fee","Poor quality, decided to return within minutes of opening the shipment. 10% restocking fee!"
5,Best of contemprary Irish Music,"Donal Lunny has assembled a group of top Irish performers - and produced a record that is about the best in contemporary (but based on traditional) Irish music. Ireland is riding the crest of an economic boom right now. There is an accompanying wave of Irish culture sweeping the world: in dance, film, theatre and music. I would regard this as cutting edge music - and representative of the new confidence and joie-de-vivre in Ireland. Irish music has moved with the times, away from the sentimental stuff that may be more familiar in the USA. Try this."
4,Good Celtic music.,"During my visit to a few local pubs in Dublin I began to appreciate the traditional Irish music played live there. Although the music in this CD has a different flavor than the music played live in the Dublin pubs, I can still recommend it. Lowlands of Holland is specially great."
4,Coolfin Review,"I purchased this C.D. because of a lady violinist that was in this group then. Her name is Mairead Nesbitt. The most beautiful and talented lady violinist, I have ever had the pleasure and honor to meet. Whatever happened to her, you may ask? Well, now she is in another group of wonderfully talented singers & musicians. A group by the name... Of Celtic Woman. Thank you."
3,"Economic Combination Syringe, Combination water bottle - 2 Qt","all i really wanted was a hot water bottle, and for the money it works"
2,CD is very tinny sounding,"The songs on this CD are good, however, the sound is very tinny and ear piercing. It's a shame because paying $17.00 for a CD with 10 songs is quite a bit of money. I love bread, but I don't like the sound in this CD. Find the songs on a different CD, Anthology has most of them."
4,Great GPS device- horrible software!,"The gps device is wonderful. Very accurate, fast, etc. Much better than a lot of those bigger garmin street pilots, etc.The software, however, blows. I ended up selling this software after I got it and instead buying Routis software, which is much better, though not perfect.So my suggestion--buy the device, search around for different software. You're just going to get ripped off if you buy the software, and then be very disatisfied."
1,Melting pot,"Frawleys book, called REALY Astrology, is a melting pot of private statements, prejudice and some, but not enough classical knowledge about classical english, mediaval and arabic astrology, in direction of a never existing single origin of Astrology, but Frawley claims this. And forgot dorotheos, Vettius Valens or Firmicus a.s.o. And all the different origins and developments. REALY he believe- or suggested-, Astrology came on earth like a book of revelation, in acient time.You need an excellent book about the realy different origins, developments and technics since the hellenistic period? Get James h. Holden's HISTORY OF HOROSKOPIC ASTROLOGY; new edited in 2006."
1,We don't need more fundamentalism,"The title implies that there is some ""real astrology"" as opposed to other that is not real or not astrology. Being familiar with the works of Robert Zoller, Robert Hand, Joseph Crane, Olivia Barclay and Anthont Louis, I can tell you that here we found very poor classical astrology, lots of half baked arguments against other astrologers, and basically a very insecure and arrogant person"
1,Patriarchal,"Realy, John Frawley claims most a naiv patriachal astrology, unsophisticated in his often like a epiphany simplified legendary - male - ancient Authors.Protect Lilly, Bonatti oder Mashalla from Frawley. Radical unlike Lilly, Frawley staged most Frawley, behind a wall of pleaded reasons for a single ancient and holy astrology.Get Lilly, it's the better and pragmatic way."
2,What a gyp!,Part two of this CD is IDENTICAL to the Techno CD in the Alex Peace High Society II Cd released last year!
4,She does it again!,"I have been a DJ Irene fanatic ever since i heard Global House Diva 2: Live in Ibiza. She is soo talented and this disc is definitely proof of that! Her mixing is flawless and the tracks are amazing! However, this album does have less disco-type stuff in it than her previous releases. Overall, this album is a must buy for any DJ Irene fan or anyone into hard house and progressive trance."
2,POOR MIX,This cd is just not very good. I'm a huge irene fan up until now and this cd is a big dissapointment. If you're already a fan check it out if not start with Phonosynthesis or Global House Diva 2 because this one just isn't cutting it. An all to obvious attempt to break into the global/european market.
3,Good Cd But way to many tracks and there too short,"I thought this was a good cd to listen too, and I mainly like Melodic,Uplifting,Proggressice Trance. The only thing I didnt like about this cd is that it has way to many tracks and some tracks are way to short less then 2 mins. I think she should have made tracks withen the 5 and 6 mins and have less tracks then have way to many tracks and be short. Overall I think its a good cd to listen to and you should get it."
5,NCIS,"I loved this product. The packaging was perfect. The extras on the later seasons were wonderful. The only only negative part was that not all of the seasons had the play-all episodes capability. Other than that, it was perfect."
3,DVD Series,Great DVD series. I bought this as a gift for christmas. I recommend this buy for who ever watches the series.
5,Quick Delivery,"Love NCIS - and getting the series just made it better. I never watched a show on TV until I saw the reruns a couple years ago, well, I was hooked and started watching but they don't play reruns in order, so I was a bit lost. Watching the series in it's entirety, much easier to understand. A must have. Waiting for the release of Season 7."
5,ncis seasons 1-5,I got the dvd's in good condition. I am part way through season 1 and so far it is very good.
4,NCIS Order,"I currently have a problem with my order. After placing the ""In Stock"" order, I received two shipments; 1 with Seasons 2 and 4, then 1 with Season 5. When the shipment time expired, I contacted Amazon about the shipment problem. A representative, Miao Lu, promptly responded and apologized for the problem. Miau Lu stated the problem would be resolved and a few days later I received Season 1. I am still waiting on Season 3. I had the option of getting a partial refund or continue searching for Season 1. Since it is a Christmas gift, I elected the searching as long as there is still time before Christmas. I prefer to have the gift. Thank You Teresa Odom"
5,NCIS SEASONS 1- 5,"recently became a NCIS watcher, and needed to catch up on character backgrounds. Ordered Seasons 1-5, and product is great!"
5,Great deal!!!,Definitely recommend buying the dvd's if you are a fan of the show! I am very pleased with the purchase. Money well spent.
4,onyx bracelet,Had no problems with the purchase. Everything happened as stated. Would recommend Amazon as a good source for purchases.
2,Valuable after the 2nd Reading,"Don't expect a flowing, memorable read out of this book. But after you refer to it a couple times for a program you're creating, it will be more useful. Lots of good suggestions, especially on programs for kids, teens and seniors.You may need to outline chapters as if you're interpreting them for an audience to organize the book's ideas. That will make the book 'stick' much better in your memory.When Sam Ham's update to Environmental Interpretation comes out, look at that instead. If he includes updates to use of modern media in interpretive programs, it'll blow Beck and Cable away.Meanwhile, if you really need a resource on modern interpretation methods, buy this book USED."
1,Read a few pages before you buy,"Empty of content, poorly written, badly printed and unedited. The book is cellophane wrapped because no one who reads a few pages would ever purchase this drivel."
5,Sunday morning coffee music !!!,"Wonderful collection of jazzy-blues, in the style that the Cheathams know best ! and the Concord recording just enhances the enjoyment ! get it and enjoy...."
3,In This House of Brede,Interesting. Books starts slow but improves as you read on. The end of the book gives one the impression it is the beginning of another book.
5,When The World Is Too Much With You,"I have given away every single copy of this book I have owned; usually to people who needed an emotional time out.It is a book of deep faith, abiding love for Christ, and how many women, with only those two characteristics in common, can actually live and work together. The idea that ""we bring ourselves with us"" to any organization is really food for thought.It is time to get another copy for myself, but no doubt it will find its way into the library of someone who needs space, and time, and quiet. It is truly a great novel, and the characters are all too familiar, and all too loved -- possibly, because of their faults."
4,Yet Another Movie?,"I have the DSOT CD, and really would like the DVD now, but every track listing I see for the DVD omitts ""Yet Another Movie."" Why would it be on the CD and not on the DVD? Please let me know if I'm misinformed.. as this is the only detail preventing me from purchasing."
5,Yes...DVD pleeeeeeeease!,"This absolutely needs to be remixed and made available on DVD; the sooner, the better."
4,"Cool Video, But A Few More Songs Could Have Been Added.","I though this video was great! I liked the lasers, lights, the close-ups of the band, and more. They had a cool mix of songs, but i think a few more songs could have been added, such as,'Another Brick In The Wall-pt.2','Yet Another Movie',and 1 or 2 more others. Other than that, this video is awsome, and I recomend it to any Pink Floyd fan!"
4,Why the annoying video effects?,"I saw this concert in Nassau Coliseum in New York in 1988. It was a great show. This would be a 5 star video but there are two problems with it. One is the slow motion during their playing, very bothersome. Two, what happened to the opening song ""Shine On You Crazy Diamonds"", there is only the last three or four minutes of it as the show starts. The song live was about 12 or 13 minutes long as heard on the CD. Please when you guys bring this to DVD give us the show as it was seen from the audience, I'm sure the film is in the archives waiting to show us the concert, the whole show. Please get rid of the special effects. Take a note from Roger Waters' DVD of ""In the Flesh"" which is a great DVD. Also saw that show in The Garden in 2000. If it doesn't come to DVD, a crime, then to Pink Floyd fans this will do."
3,Fantastic concert! Not so fantastic DVD.,"Tracks don't always line up with the beginning of the songs. Audio and video are SLIGHTLY out of sync. That said, it's still a fantastic concert."
2,Thunderous Dud...,"The video and concert are great, (as it was on VHS), but the sound is terrible. The purchase is ok if you are a collector of concert video or a Pink Floyd fan. I wish the recording company would make a real copy of the original concert, but I also wish Pink Floyd was touring again! Oh well, those days are gone..."
1,Sond & Picture quality,"I have waited over 20 years for the DVD, realizing the picture, and mostly the sound, would be incredible. Just recd the DVD, DO NOT BUY THIS. Sound quality is terrible, no bass, very poor 5.1 mix. The picture quality is like watching my VHS version on a a player with very bad video head. This is a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Why isn't Blu Ray available? Buy PULSE instead. I do like seeing the young Floyd, this concert was amazing, but this DVD does it no justice. I think I know why it has taken this long for the DVD to come out. Pink Floyd was embarrased by the quality of the product, but some corporate VP saw a good chance to make a buck, not caring about the quality."
5,"BEST GUITAR SOLO EVER RECORDED, TRUE.........","What am I saying?Yes, On the Turning Away done live on this album is without question the summit of great lead guitar work. Gilmour bleeds his Strat and blends it with power chords that weaken the knees. Best lead guitar song ever recorded. Stack it against any, and I mean any, guitar solo. There seems to be a ""how fast can he play?"" or ""how complicated can he get?"" mentality in music in the past decades. On the Turning Away is hard evidence that quality and craftmanship cannot be rushed. Gilmour was voted Number 1 Guitarist of All Time in a UK Billboard poll a couple of years ago. Here is the proof. It is PURE MAGIC."
5,awesome laser graphics,"where else can you see someone light a cigarette with a laser beam??? awesome video much better than the wall video... pink floyd did it again. i have the cd and must have heard it a thousand times and still am not tired of it.. i wish ""welcome to the machine"" was on that concert. oh well maybe next time. i have been a fan since 1971 and still am."
5,Almost as good as being there!!!,"For those Floyd Fans that have had the opportunity to see them live, like myself, this is a treat. For those who haven't, this is a must! Great light show and effects, awesome selection of music. I know Waters was weeping after he saw this."
3,A little disappointing,"I must say that I was disappointed with this video. I had seen PULSE a number of times and this just doesn't compare. This is not the fault of the Floyd, however. The music and show is great but whoever filmed it spent to much time with close ups of the band when I wanted to see the light show. Also, too much slow motion and really slow dissolves. PULSE allows you to enjoy the complete show more whereas this thing looks like it was filmed and edited by someone who just figured out how to do slow motion and dissolves in editing and decided to show off a bit to much."
1,Delicate Bore,"I am a huge Pink Floyd fan and I don't recommend this video one bit. It is slow moving and has the worst camera shots ever! The laser light show was barely noticed because of the awful camera people. Well this video was also ruined by the slow motion effects. And Pink FLoyd performed in a sleepy dull manner. I recommend Pulse on video if you want a real pink floyd show, or Roger Water's The Wall on video. Do not spend money on this mess! Sound quality was bad too."
2,WASTE OF TIME - CONSIDERING....,"Don't waste your time or money on this inferior video when there is a FAR SUPERIOR video - P.U.L.S.E. I cannot believe that ANYONE would CHOOSE this version over the P.U.L.S.E. video. The visuals are dull and by comparison - well, there IS no comparison! The sound and musical quality pretty much suck in my opinion (now remember I am a HUGE fan - just NOT of this video!) Maybe I WOULD have enjoyed this if I hadn't already seen P.U.L.S.E and been totally blown away (it's the BEST thing ever recorded in my HUMBLE opinion). I was SO disappointed by this that I only watched it once (compared to MANY viewings of P.U.L.S.E. Only buy this if you're curious. Otherwise save your dough for the REAL thing - P.U.L.S.E."
3,How about Nick Mason & Richard Wright?,"Seems as if the * of the show is David Gilmour? How about a little more footage for the rest of the band instead of 90% Gilmour & the three girls? I thought Mason & Wright could rock-on a lot more than they did with this concert. Gilmore seemed pretty restrained too. Is it an age thing? Is Santana the only 60's rocker with any youthful energy left?Also, guess I'm old school as the production is too MTV'ish for my tastes. Less fancy lighting with thoses aggravating 1 seconds clips and more/ longer shots of the musicians (besides Gilmour & the three girls, please)! Their performance seemed almost too polished without much movement for most of the concert. Maybe it will grow on me, but it's nothing like their early 70's ""Live at Pompeii"" tape. I rest my case."
3,The Sound of Thunder through a Haze,Pink Floyd Delicate Sound of Thunder DVD has been on my watch list for several years before I found it on Amazon. The my old VCR version was great - played it many times. None of my Pink Floyd collection was as visionally disappointing as this DVD production. The hazy picture produced interfered with both the visual presentations and the camera shots of the players. A real downer !
5,"Come on David, when are you going to put out the dvd??","I fulfilled a teenage dream when I attended this concert in the late 80s. I wanted to see Pink Floyd during the Wall tour in 1980, but of course, the band only held concerts in California and New York. Upon my arrival at the venue (The Palace at Auburn Hills, MI.), I passed semi after semi trailer, and my girlfriend asked what they were for. I said, dumbstruck, ""Ohmigod, they must have contained the band's equipment and stage setup"".I am in my late forties, and I have seen many concerts, but I have never have been literally hypnotized as I was by the music, theatrics, and light show performed by Pink Floyd. During the concert, I looked around at the audience, and was amazed by the expressions on people's faces. Slack-jawed wonder, and unblinking eyes!! No need for mind altering chemicals with this concert!!This video is well worth the price you pay for it, and I refuse to sell mine. But NOTHING compares to seeing them LIVE!!!"
5,Lost for words,"I would like to express how awesome this video is. First things first, my boyfriend of 2 years is a huge fan of Pink Floyd, and when we first met, I must confess that I wasn't too familiar with Pink Floyd, and getting together was the greatest thing ever to do, he taught me the history and the beautiful music Pink Floyd has made over the years, ""Animals"" took my breath away, and when I found this video I bought this video on the web, and gave it to him, and was he surprised, and since I have not seen this video, I was pretty anxious to watch it. Well, I must say, I was lost for words, I was into the rythym and the laser show, the pig floating around, it was awesome. The best video ever to have been produced. Pink Floyd rocks my world other than my boyfriend of course, but I would really like to see this video come out on DVD, NOW THAT WOULD BE AWESOME, as one reviewer put it, vhs tapes do get worn out, especially to those who watch this video as we do. PLEASE!!"
2,No Pictures of Dishes!,"To be honest, ever since I bought this book, I haven't cooked a single dish from this book yet because since there were no pictures of the dishes, I didn't know what the results of each recipe looked like. This has prevented me from taking the time to actually choose and cook a dish from the book. I much prefer the ""Wei Chuan"" series of cookbooks ... they have photos with each recipe, clear instructions, and they are authentic Chinese cookbooks published in Asia. I come from Hong Kong, and I find that the recipes inside the Wei Chuan books are really good; they are really the type of food that you can find in nice restaurants in Hong Kong, yet the dishes can be cooked easily and quickly!"
3,Upon further review: maybe too authentic?,"I'm submitting a followup review here after looking at a recipe in detail.The example that decided things for me was the 'Ants Climb a Tree' (mah ngai seung seuh) traditional dish.Frying the rice noodles first in six cups of peanut oil and the use of Sichuan pepper pickle, preserved horse beans, and sweet wine rice are points where the recipe is more involved than others that I have seen. Substitutions are suggested for some but not all of the items. The result may be more authentic but requires more effort."
5,My best cookbook,"I was always intimidated by the prospect of Chinese cooking. But now among my dozens of cookbooks, for many types of cuisine, I value this the most. I learned techniques from the pictures and descriptions I otherwise could not have understood. And I found the ingredients in my local Asian market thanks to Eileen's ""Chinese Larder"" section. And the recipes are delicious."
3,Great in theory,"I weighed several Chinese cookbooks prefering something authentic. This book looked great in terms of its variety and introductory details. It contains many recipes I remember seeing family and guests sharing during holiday parties. However, when I met with friends to try and make a few of these recipes we found they were very time consuming. Now I know practice will speed cooking up but it just felt tedious. The ingredients also required a lot of investment in items that take a bit of effort to find and store if you don't use regularly. I have no doubt that these recipes end in wonderful dishes but you have to be pretty dedicated."
4,this is a great cookbook!,"Eileen Yin-Fei Lo is a good writer, and helps you understand the Chinese attitude towards cooking and food selection. Not only are the recipes authentic, but they range from the difficult, special-occasion dishes (glutinous rice-stuffed chicken) to the most basic home preparations (pickled mustard greens). Being Cantonese-American, it reminded me of recipes my mother and grandmother used to make. My only caveat about the book is that the recipes are not categorized by type of main ingredient (not even in the index), making it hard to find a recipe you recall seeing in the book. Otherwise, an excellent introduction to Cantonese cuisine!!"
1,Teenage Bubble-gum Pop,"Well, I admit, I was hooked onto Wheatus with the semi-hit 'Teenage Dirtbag'... so I bought this CD knowing nothing else about this band other than they sing that kewl Teenage dirtbag song (In fact, I thought the lead singer was a chick) well, the next 15 minutes following was probably the worst beating my ears have received, and I have a mom that listens to old cowboy country music... this is the worst album ever made, I know 6th graders that can rock better than these over-night one hit wonders... save yourself some money and buy the single of Teenage dirtbag... hell, that song isn't even worth $6, download it FREE on Napster, if you feel it's even worth the 3 meg of space on your comp."
4,okaaaaaaay,"being the confused person i am i must tell you that i have heard on more than one occasion that the band's name was teenage dirtbag, on television and the radio. i was look for the loser sound track originally to find a song that i didn't know what was called or who sang it,you know the one where they go ""why-i why you always kick me when i'm high-i""(and if you know what it's called e-mail me at angell2005@webtv.net)to find that loser didnt have a soundtrack yet er somthin' so i checked out teenage dirtbag under songs and it came up to be by wheatus who i think i've heard of before so now i'm really confused but anyway this is a good CD and the lead singer does not sound like a girl.puh-leze if i knew a girl that souded like that i'd shoot her"
5,Wheatus,I Bought this CD for a very small amount of money and I gotta say it came in great condition and worked like a charmed. No problems or nothing great seller and product.
4,Love for 'Dirtbag',"The release teenage dirtbag is awesome. It's the reason I like Wheatus in the first place. I love the remake of ""A Little Respect"". Any time some band does a remake they sometimes over do it - but not here. Great Buy, Good Fun."
3,"Three words ""One Hit Wonder""",Teenage Dirtbag is the only thing that make me even put this CD in my player. The other tracks are boring. They have a decent singer it just appears the rest of the band isn't that good. Get this used at a local record store. Your usually can get it for 3.99 any where.
3,I'm just a Teenage Dirtbag,"Wheatus' self titled album is a refreshing sound of the new style of punk rock. The album is slightly similar to the sounds of Blink 182, but Wheatus is not as commercial. This CD is great if your just looking for a good time but musically it is not a masterpiece. All in all it is worth the money, although there are many other bands with the same musical stylings."
5,Blissed,"Well, I have to admit that this is just over 33 minutes of pure pop-rock perfection. I bought the album because of the cover of Erasure's ""Little Respect"" and though my usual musical taste is Beethoven, this is brilliant. Every song is fast and stimulating. None bore, and all are full of interesting sounds and, um, lyrics. Humour and wit fill these songs, and Brenden B. Brown's whiny but wonderful voice is marvellous, and ever changing. These are jumpy good-to-be-alive songs and though some of the language is dodgy, it is never too much, and never overly noticable. A fun, bright, happy album that shows great potential. Not too rock, and not too pop: it brushes away the stodgy overly produced sound that has filled the charts and radio over the last few years: a breath of fresh, witty, self-knowing air."
3,Funny,"This is the perfect album to listen to when you are doing something else in the same time. Because if you put your headphones on and really try to LISTEN to the music, then you'll get bored very soon.Wheatus is a funny, talented band, that definetely brought something new to today's music. But nothing else. It isn't one of those bands who will be remembered for many years to come, and this isn't one of those albums to listen to many times.The sound is good, most songs are good, the lyrics are funny. The singer has a really thin voice, which is cool most of the times, but there are situations when it gets really annoying.All in all, you won't regret spending your money on this album, but you won't listen to it for too many times."
5,This book is GREAT!,This book is the best book ever! My school is doing a play on it and I'm a seahorse! Children of all ages will LOVE IT! So order this book RIGHT NOW!
5,Spectacular Book,"Graeme Base has created a spectacular book, a combination of breathtaking illustrations and a wonderful story wrapped into an excellent rhyming scheme. Base's use of great artistry to capure the ""magic"" of the story is extremely effective, and young children should find the book fascinating."
5,I love this book,"Sign of the Seahorse is such a charming book. Graeme Base is a terrific artist, and this book is one of his best. I was a bit doubtful about the idea of an epic poem about the adventures of a bunch of fish as I am not one for reading poetry. However, it was great fun, and the poetry was a nice bit of whimsy. Every page has color illustrations, and Base made a large, decorated map for the reader to follow the action in the story. This book is a good read-aloud for younger children, and you will enjoy the book as well."
5,Must Have for your Child's Collection,"I discovered Sign of the Seahorse in college and immediately fell in love with its characters and AMAZING illustrations. The most imaginative details have been painted to create this magical underwater wonderland. The story is full of adventure, love, crime, conflict and perseverance. ALl told in the most rhythmic of verse. Now, I get to enjoy telling this Hgh-Adventure tale to my two daughters of only 4 and 2 years. They love it. They too fell in love with Finneaus and Pearl. 2 Fins Up!"
2,"The Sign of the Seahorse, for Adults or Children?","This book has beautiful illustrations and is very unique, however it did not hold my son's attention for very long. I believe this book is for older children and for adults much more so than for my nearly 4 year old. The story is quite long and some of the language used is not part of most small children's vocabulary."
3,"The Seahorses suddenly vanish,and the Groupers are defeated.","The book is like a play,and it has rhymes! But the bad thing about it,is that it's not very easy to read,and it degrades females."
2,A not-so -great book on a Greek island,"I enjoy reading books on Greece so I buy a lot of them. This one was a disappointment. I have to agree with the reviewer (above) who says it is a waste of time. It is one of those books that lament the advent of mass tourism and infrastructure development, and I suppose these inevitable changes deserve lamenting in several senses, but other writers have done it so much better. Maybe the first and last chapters could be recommended but the rest is boring. None of the characters come alive and none of the real issues they face are made as clear as they should be. All the people (tourists and locals) seem to do is drive around looking at the mountains and eat... and they all eat too much."
2,Not what I wanted,"The author writes:""I have translated fairly closely where that has been possible; but I have also paraphrased, expanded, contracted, deleted, shuffled the order of verses and freely improvised on the themes of the originals."". This was not bad devotional free verse poetry but to call it specifically a translation of the book of psalms is very misleading. King James version and JPS have done it better. It is more inspired from the book of psalms than an actual translation. I give it a pass."
5,one of my absolute all time favorite records,"this CD used to be import only, but now you can buy it here. i once had the good fortune to meet John Mooney and recited his catalog to him and begged for more. He modestly told me ""oh, there's this live thing they did in Germany"". I spent untold bucks tracking this down until i called the Crosscut label in Germany- i bought 5 copies at $25 each PLUS shipping from Germany,to give to my closest friends and they still thank me to this day. you'll never find this one in ""the bin"" it's just too rockin'. if you've ever seen John live then just buy it right now."
1,Watch a Fulci movie instead....,"I love Italian exploitation, but this movie forgets to throw in the exploitation. The worst Italian horror flick of all time? Maybe, but then what about Evil Clutch..?"
2,really bad,"Story, acting, efx(hardly any), are all poor. Not enough extras on dvd to compensate for the lackluster movie. Skip it altogether."
2,No connection to Demons 1&2!!,I hate this movie. No connection to Demons 1&2. Its like the Halloween III of the Demons movies.
2,Demons 3: The Ogre,"THE OGRE is one of three unofficial sequels to the original DEMONS, the others being BLACK DEMONS and Michele Soavi's nightmarish THE CHURCH. Of the three, this is easily the weakest option. If it were not bad enough that DEMONS 3: THE OGRE was a made-for-TV sequel in-name-only, the fact that it doesn't contain any demons makes things that much worse. Instead, a writer and her family are terrorized by a savage ogre that lives beneath their vacation villa in Northern Italy. With the excessive gore, nudity, and violence removed in order to make it suitable for television, all that is left is a dry and dreadfully boring fantasy horror flick that seems to be geared towards a younger audience. The few creepy moments that do exist in the film can only be attributed to the sinister set designs found in the villa's subterranean crypts. Lamberto Bava does as much as he can on the scaled-down budget, but THE OGRE is better left to obscurity.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,worst movie ever,I'm sorry but Demons 1 and 2 were good but Demons 3 was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I'm upset that I wasted $3.00 on it...LOL!
3,Not Bright!,"These highlighters are great, if you don't like really bright, bold highlighting. I gave them to my kids for their own use, I am a law student and need things to pop off the page... this wasn't what I was looking for. But for other things, like regular reading or cookbook marking... they would be great.Disappointed for my purposes, but may be just what you need for yours!"
1,Not recommended,"The one value I found in this book was the collection of parallel sayings of Jesus and Buddha. But there are good and better collections elsewhere. Other than that I am sorry I cannot recommend the book. The author's understanding of Christian theology, especially of the Christian East, is seriously lacking. His intention is good, but his execution is simply sub-par."
4,Interesting concept,"Although I have been aware of similarities in the precepts of Christianity and Buddhism, I never realized to what degree how closely those precepts were originally taught by each of the messengers. A good read for those who would like to strengthen their own faith and belief structure via comparison religions."
4,Book actually better than DVD,"This book on Einstein gave me (someone who previously knew next to nothing about him save for E=mc2) some background and insight into the man behind the myth.Like many geniuses, Einstein seems to have been a wizard with physics, but not quite so adept at his personal relationships.The book was very linear and instructive, although half of the actual pages are devoted to a reprint of Einstein's papers from 1905, so the read is actually very short.However, the book is much better than the accompyaning Biography DVD program which is anything but linear and jumps around in Einsteins life. If I'd watched the DVD first instead of reading the book my understanding of what happened in his life when would have been totally askew.That being said, I enjoyed the book very much and now feel that I have at least more than the average insight into the life of a man who will forever be remembered as the world's greatest physicist."
4,A brief biography of Einstein,"This is an interesting biography of Einstein emphasizing his family history and his ""miracle year"" when he published his greatest work. Part of the book is an explanation of the theory of relativity. This follows the biographical section. The writing style is easy to understand and the author is an authority being an astronomer."
2,Not really a book...,"This book is really something of a scam. There are only 128 pages of new content. The rest is a reprint of an essay Einstein wrote around 1916 on relativity. Most readers will not actually read this, so the book is itself actually more of a long essay. Which is unfortunate, because that magical year could use a full length treatment. In such an abbreviated format, each paper is not presented in adequate detail even for a lay reader. I hope this doesn't stop someone else from doing this correctly."
1,naa,"i have not received the ghost whisperer set yet. i have to find out where it is. the delivery information said it was shipped on 12/26/08 the same day as boston legal was shipped, one package showed up"
4,Solid Step-by-step Coverage,Easy reading and not intimidating. This book covers the basics smoothly and progressively. If you are trying to pick up the basics of asp quickly this is highly recommended.
1,Bad book in a good series,"I already had good success learning HTML and Javascript from other Weekend Crash Course books and put it to use at work. So I expected the same from this book. After 23 chapters of things I already knew about HTML and Visual Basic, Mr. Smith begins his application. Like another reviewer here, I was absolutely lost. (The errors in the book don't help.) I loaded his eOrganizer example from the CD, changed the connection to the Access database I built according to chapter 22, and I can't get any further.His insistance on structured programming is the death of his lesson. I know the value of structured programming, but structure has no value if I can't write a program. The basics should be taught before forcing style upon the reader.I need to connect web pages to databases. Sorry, Mr. Smith, I'll have to buy a different book to learn how."
2,Source code bluff,"I would like anybody looking at this book to know that none of the key source code is included in the CD, though the book cover states that it does."
4,decent price and quality,"Bought this control arm recenty to replace a Deeza Chassis control arm. The Deeza Chassis control arm was not that great, the sway bar screw hole got worn out in 6 months. Not sure why, but most likely poor metal quality. This Dorman control arm seems to be better quality. Everything is a nice fit with no problems so far."
5,The best yet...,"I have been a fan of the Flecktones for years, and all of their work is incredible. This CD, however, is by far the best of the best. It is, in a word, INCREDIBLE! The Flecktones have a variety of artists to support them, and they blend them into the music seamlessly to create a wonderful sound. From beautiful, slow songs to up-beat numbers, it is all great. And on this album more than others, Victor Wooten, Jeff Coffin and Futureman have a chance to exhibit their immense talent. Sure, this sounds like I'm a publicist trying to promote their product, but I'm not. I'm just a fan who is enjoying the fascinating creative talents of the four Flecktones. Now I can't wait to see them in person...again!"
2,whats going on here,I do not understand why this cd sounds more like kenny g than the flecktones. This sounds like something that should be played on the elevator at sears. I loved all their previous albums but I just don't get this one. They should remain strictly instrumental and this thing that future man uses the royale or whatever makes me want to puke. How can you go from Sinister minister on live art to the songs on this album. I know that a bands music should evolve but this is just outrageous. I saw them live a little while ago and they were awesome except for the songs where future man sung and that damn machine he uses with him humming in the background. For anyone who does not have this album and is a fleckotnes fan I advise you not to buy it because if you are like me you will be embarrassed to even have it in your cd player.
4,"Who are these guys, & what have they done w the Flecktones?","Don't get me wrong, I like this album, on the whole. That's why I gave it 4 stars. But where is Vic? Heck, where's Bela? They are so far submerged under layers & layers of sound, you can barely pick them out. Guests outnumber Flecktones on something like 11 of 16 tracks. Bela only plays banjo on 10. Victor is almost impossible to find in the mix. Still, Scratch & Sniff is great funk; Hoedown is a wild ride; Zona Mona is a fine tune; & A Moment So Clear is an incredible mix of sounds & textures. But this band has become Jeff Coffin, Roy Wooten aka FutureMan aka Royel, and guests, including Bela Fleck, Victor Wooten, & many more. I'm looking forward to seeing them live again, where I hope Bela & Vic don't get swallowed up in the mix. Bela has always been the least egotistical, most generous of frontmen, but as a longtime fan (2o years), I am having a hard time getting used to the overproduced wall of sound."
3,We want the old Bela back!,"U2 has found out the hard way that people want to hear their ""original"" sound. I hope Bela learns that soon, and I hope Futch decides to stop his whinny singing and they get back to great instrumentalization."
5,Musicianship at it's best,"Ladies and Gentlemen...save a few bucks and buy this cd now! My friends, this was the cd that changed me from a Metallica fan to a Flecktones fan, it's that good. (Yes I'm serious) As a bass player, I have all but idolized Victor Wooten, and the compositional virtuosity of Bela Fleck is outstanding, as are the solos of Jeff Coffin and the vocals/drumming of Futureman.The extra musicians here do not drown out the flecktones at all. If you are complaining that you can't hear the banjo or the bass, maybe that is what's meant to happen. It forces you to become a better listener of music, if you can abandon your desires for a blazingly fast solo and learn to appreciate a simply beautiful song like ""Zona Mona"" or ""Shuba Yatra."" There's a reason this album won a grammy, and I have a feeling that had a lot to do with the extra musicians and how Bela could pull it all together."
4,Great new sounds,"The Flecktones consistently please with their signature sound, professional blend, and quality arrangements. I agree with many of the other reviews and add this CD is (thankfully) an evolution of the Flecktone sound. Live Art was incredible (5 stars); Left of Cool took an introspective turn. Outbound goes further with a way-fuller sound and great material. I like the path this band breaking."
4,helpful,I only got this because most of my classmates told me it was the best tool to have during internships.It was helpful. Just not during an emergency situation..
5,Must have for Rad Tech students,"A senior student suggested this to me and what a great suggestion it was!Positioning information, SID, OID, Collumnation... its all there, even what the patient should look like before the exposure. Really a great purchase."
3,Book is defective,"The book itself is very well done, just this one had sections that were out of order, making it difficult to reference. My son has been using it this way & doesn't want to give it up so we can send it back for an exchange. Apparently it happened when it was bound in the spiral binding & we can't take it apart to fix it! My son is a Radiology student & loves the book anyway."
4,"Excellent, but should've included radiographs.","Had I known it didn't contain radiographs, I would have bought a different book. Otherwise, for its size, its a great help."
5,"The best ""little"" book ever...","I just graduated from xray school and this book was a lifesaver. If at any time when I was in clinicals and couldn't remember how to do something, I would just pull out this nifty little book and refresh my memory. The best part about the book to me was the area at the bottom of every positioning page to put your own techniques. Being in 6 different clinical facilities, this book helped out a lot."
5,Very handy.,"I am a Rad. Tech. returning to a clinical environment from a long hiatus. This pocket reference book has been extremely helpful in refreshing my memory, and will stay with me for a long time to come. The fourth edition includes the new advances in technology like digital radiography which is a large part of my new job."
5,Propaganda in the Cold War,"This is ""must"" reading for students of the Cold War as well as anyoneinterested in what is now calledPublic Diplomacy. It's also a nostalgia trip for those legions who worked for the US Information Agency before it was folded into the State Department in 1999 after 43 years of telling America's story to the world. It portrays an exciting but little known or appreciated branch of this country's diplomatic service."
1,picture and description are not what you receive,"the picture and description relate to a jack plate in all possible ways. there is nothing written about a stress plate except in title. what you receive is a piece of aluminum plate with four holes drilled in it. i knew the price was too good to be true, but thought someone on that end may have screwed up and ...well...i screwed up. praise to amazon for covering the purchase."
5,Essential reading for law enforcement,"This book depicts a geniune need in law enforcement. The need to hire, train, and maintain ethical personnel is explained and stressed to the reader in a way that has been overdue. The occupation of a law enforcement offical world wide has a real need to be a true character , role model, or the public offical that can be trusted. Edwin has a clear style of writing with a no nonsense approach to describe past , present, and future occurrences of police conduct. I believe the criminal justice system would beam with pride and public trust if law enforcement would read and act on the issues and suggestion that Delattre brings forth in this fine book."
5,Good summer activity,I have used these workbooks for years. They do a page a day and it takes less then 30 min. My kids love doing them and it keeps there brains working.
3,Review of Summer Bridge Activities,I purchased this for my 8 year old grandson who will be entering 3rd grade. We found that the bridge from 2nd to 3rd was too easy and were much happier with the 3rd to 4th grade bridge for him. We live in southern california and the math in the 2nd to 3rd review was much too easy.
4,perfect for the summer,I have been a primary school teacher for 15 years and always recommend the Summer Bridge books to the parents.
4,Nice summer tool for review.,"I have used the Summer Bridges workbooks with my children for several years. The review is very nice for them, and working with them helps me to know where they need extra help.I ask them to do one page of ""morning work"" from the book each day. They have ADD, so some days it takes all morning to get it done.Unfortunately, my children hate doing the work. It is difficult to convince them that it is worth their trouble.I'd love to hear ideas for making it a little more fun."
5,Got a head start on this one.,"I've actually had this CD on my computer for over a month. If you are a fan of Gothenburg metal, this is for you! The vocals are conspiciously American, for they are an American band, after all. Actually, they are a American hardcore band, but this is a Gothenburg CD, recorded in Gothenburg, Sweden. This CD defines Gothenburg, this CD defines kick ... you know. There isn't much to say about this, though nothing on this CD screams ""talented"", it is not at all lacking.GOTHENBURG RULES!!! BUY THIS!!!"
5,Amazing,"Wow...what can I say. This album is amazing. The first Darkest Hour CD that I bought was Undoing Ruin, which I thought was pretty damn good. So then I went and bought their older CD, Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation. Holy crap do I love this CD. It really doesn't sound much like Undoing Ruin actually, but I like it better.Hidden Hands is a WHOLE HOUR of pure thrashcore energy. I was amazed that each song is four or more minutes long -- none of it is filler either. Each and every song has so much energy behind it, I don't know how the band memebers are able to pull it off without dying of exhaustion. I die of exhaustion every time I hear ""Oklahoma"". Whenever I hear that song, I can't help but just bang my head to the full four minutes of it.While Undoing Ruin is great on record, Hidden Hands also captures the essence of a live show."
4,Let the metal onslaught begin!,"You will probably need to catch your breath after being bombarded with the ear assault that is ""Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation"". ""Metal"" fans who lend themselves to more of a hardcore rock sound, TURN BACK NOW!! This album is way too intense for you. However, if the sound of an extremely heavy album with the furious pace of a punk band sounds intriguing, you should pick up this album, you'll love it. Just be careful and don't hurt yourself."
3,I dont know why,I just cant seem to want to listen to it. Its good music and all but I never want to listen to it. If you like darkest hours other stuff you should get this.
2,Not for small goldfish,"I bought these goldfish pellets hoping to make the water in the tank less cloudy. The goldfish don't go ape crazy over it like they do with the flakes. It's usually a feeding frenzy. With the pellets, they just mill around until one sinks in front of their face.The smallest goldfish can't seem to eat it. I'm going to have to go buy flakes tomorrow, because the poor fish looks like it can't even swallow it. It eats it, spits it out, eats it, spits it out.The one thing the pellets do as promised is float. We have one of those waterfall filters, which pushes the pellets down. They sink a little and then float back up, and they stay floating for quite a while. They don't dissolve very quickly. I guess the water is a little more clear than usual, but that won't matter if the fish die of starvation."
2,Doesn't float,Only about 1/3 floats when you put it in. The rest of it sinks to the bottom before the fish can even get to it. The fish seem to hate it too.
4,Loud Maracas,"These maracas are fantastic! They cut really well through a full band, and have a nice crisp sound. Easy to control when you are playing fast and hard, but a little hard to control in quiet gigs.... To have nice loud natural wood fuller sonding pair of marcas go for the Toca Hand Painted Maracas These have a very natural, non plastic sound to them, and they have a great look. More volume and presence than a shaker, but not overbearing like those huge LP's non natural sounding pair."
3,Suntheanine Tablet Review,It seems to work although not intensely noticable. I used it for a month of stressful situations in addition to another prescription item.
3,Its alright,"I got these because I suffer from anxiety. They made me feel slightly relaxed for a little while, but nothing substantial. I think maybe I was hoping for too much. I will continue to take them to see if after a few weeks it will make a little bit more of a difference. Maybe if they are combined with something else they might last a bit longer. All in all not a terrible purchase but I was hoping for a little more."
1,Doesn't work :(,This product does nothing for me. I was expecting to be less agitated and happier throughout the day but that hasn't happened. I've noticed (and those around me have too) that I'm still really anxious and stressed and I cry a lot. I tried taking multiple supplements at the same time and it still doesn't have an effect. I won't be buying this again.
2,For Me .... This doesn't do anything,"I have heard a lot of good things about Suntheanine ..... bit for me it doesn't do anything. I do know friends who feel it makes them calmer, but I have tried it many times and it just makes no difference for me."
1,Don't buy this GPS,Purchased this GPS to connect to my HP548.Unit was very easy to set up and install software.Map files are very large so for any long distance traveling you will need a larger CF card for the map files. I purchased a 256mb just for this purpose.Initially the unit kept saying to recheck the power connections when I tried to get the GPS to sync with the satellites. When it finally did sync with 3 of the 8 possible satellites it would intermittently lose sync with them making the unit basically worthless.
3,"Some errors in his research, but otherwise a decent read","I was given this book as a gift by two different people. I read it and was disappointed to find very easily discoverable errors in regards to the history of the Circassians. I would say get this book, but read cautiously."
5,Excellent book. Highly recommended!,"I've been an Access developer for the past 10 years. Now our company is finally migrating our data over to a SQL 2000 database. This book is an excellent resource for those transitioning from Access to SQL. The information is well thought out, laid out in an easy to use format, supplies good examples, and has a tremendous amount of useful information."
5,The best book if you wan to know detail about upsize Access to SQL Server,"I bought two similar books at the same time, only this book tells me the detail I really want to know .If you are a user who upsized your Access database to SQL Server, and had problems or questions about your database, this is the book you should read."
1,Third rate,"This so called comedy is absolutely awful. The acting is bad, the so called comedy is overdone by pedantically over emphasizing the lines the actors, directors or writers thought were funny. Essentially, not worth the postage! War and Peace has more laughs than these travesties"
3,Worked for 5 months then failed.,Bought this to replace my OEM on my 2004 Escape. Easy to change out since the pump sits under the LH passenger seat. Worked great for 5 months then failed. I am now trying the pump from PrecisePart #P2291M
3,Something Different,"From first thing in the morning when he wakes up, this movie follows a ""loser"" guy through a day filled with minor disasters and memories of his girlfriend, who has just left him. The whole thing is narrated by his internal dialog and memories of what his girlfriend said to him. There is no other dialog. He is agoraphobic, has social anxiety, low self esteem, and appears to be autistic. He is struggling to cope with everyday life, but finds some inner strength through his experiences - at least for now. It's a rather quirky character study that will appeal to some, but not all."
4,Interesting read,"I agree with most of what the author says, and plan to reread this soon! I have felt some of the same discomfort at prophecies that are way off the mark, and then explained away."
3,"Not a bad JFK Assassination survey, mostly of the folkes who were in the Oliver Stone JFK movie","Even 'Red'Asner, a real leftist jerkin real life, has SERIOUS doubtsabout the silly 'Oswald SHOT JFK', per-iod, believing morons like D.R. Von Pein(or is it Pinhead?)...Well, anybody wholikes the Cincinnati 'Reds' deserves tobe brainwashed, I guess!"
1,Intriguing trash,"This is intriguing, like the film JFK. But that is canceled out by the fact that Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone completely slandered Clay Shaw! They should both have served time for it. How would you like it, if after you were dead, some ego-ridden director made a movie saying you killed Nicole Brown Simpson. It would be the same exact thing. Please, please, please read Gerald Posner's book CASE CLOSED. It will show you logically that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone killer of Kennedy. I know that's hard to believe, after all the conspiracy hype. I opened that book skeptical, but came away convinced. Posner also has a chapter answering the Jim Garrison/Oliver Stone theory, and answers why it's garbage."
5,Johnny Ray JR-2,Just bought a boat and needed to mount a Lowrance Transducer to the trolling motor instead of the transom without buying a new transducer. Works great. Keeps transducer from hitting bottom too.
1,bad for the eyes,"My wife bought this light and is not at all pleased with it. It only illuminates a very small area of the page at one time. She can't even read an entire lie without moving the light down the page. She gave up attaching it to the book so she could hold it in one hand and the book in the other, thus allowing her to move the light around to be able to read."
5,Great Video for Toddler Expecting a New Sibling,"Our 2 1/2-year old boy loves this video. He showed little interest in it before his little sister was born but really enjoys watching it since she has joined our family because he can relate to little bear's experiences. It has helped him understand both the positive and negative emotions he was feeling about being a big brother, and has helped him understand why his baby sister cries and doesn't play with him yet. It is a great gift for any family expecting a new baby."
3,Might be better for older children,"I bought this DVD for my 18 month old. He is a huge fan of Sesame Street (especially Elmo aka ""Melmo"") and likes to watch the other Sesame Street videos we have.This DVD does not capture his attention at all. As we are expecting another baby later this year, I have played this movie on many separate occassions, but he has just not been interested. I read the reviews from other parents whose children enjoyed it before buying it, but certainly can't say the same for my son. Perhaps it is a better choice for older children."
4,My daughter loves this!,"My 19 month old daughter is literally obsessed w/ this video--she wants to watch it all day, every day (we've limited her to once per day only). A friend gave it to me to prepare her for her new sister who's coming in the next few weeks. Personally, I think this video is about 20 mins too long (it's almost an hour and tends to drag on and on in a few parts), kinda ends on a down note and--worst of all--Baby Bear has a weird speech impediment that makes him say a lot of words incorrectly, like typical ""child talk"" ie. ""bear"" is ""bayurh."" I find that speech issue to set a bad example for my child. Other than that, it's a cute story and keeps my daughter fully occupied while I put makeup on or do my hair for work."
5,SUCH AN EXCELLENT PREP FOR MY 2 1/2YR OLD!,"My daughter loved Sesame Street while I was pregnant and loved to watch movies so this was a most excellent prep for her to understand what was coming up. I can't recommend this DVD enough. Perhaps for a very active child who won't sit to watch a whole movie it might not work as well but as for that I have two things to say: first, this movie is good for PARENTS too! It touched on so many of the before, during and after points where the older child and parents have to prepare and adjust. (ps what an adjustment it has been this last year!) Secondly, if you replay this a few times your active kid will still absorb a lot of the story and it might just initiate some good conversations anyway. Get this movie!"
5,A frank talk with God,"I am sorry that this book is not available as I write this review because it is an absolutely wonderful book. Anna of the title is a small girl who is taken in by Flynn and his mother. As a child she has a simplistic view of the world. She always reverences God in her conversations by addressing him as Mr. God and Jesus as Mr. God's son. It is a book that allows you to explore faith with childlike wonder. A tragedy tests the family's beliefs but it is Anna's faith in God that will see them through. I read this book when I was fourteen, some years ago, and it has always remained one of my favorites. I hope to see it back in print soon."
2,Not for me.,"This product may be functional to someone who can swallow this log-of-bark, unfortunately this was not the case for me.Surely the landfill enjoyed this product. :)"
5,Intricate thriller,This is a fine piece of work. The central figure is a con man who witnesses a gang shooting in London and manages to make a bizarre plan to con a businessman out of thousands of pounds sterling. The characters are very well drawn. The plot catches the reader early. The atmosphere is fine. And the finale is a fine surprise. This is a good example of the way that a thriller should be. Highly recommended.
5,I am much for aware...so watch out !,Being left at the hjospital and other places for the firsst 22 months of my life...this bood really showed me why I'm the way I am sometime...This book is good read for everybody...Adopted or not !Healing the Eight Stages of Life
5,Awesome! Best of Breed!!,"The T43 is everything promised and more! The screen is bright and clear, connectivity is easy fast and secure and the magnesium case is light and durable."
3,hardwood bench,the hardwood bench we purchased was really easy to assemble but after a week in the weather it developed several large cracks or splits in the wood.we are somewhat disappointed that we have to repair the cracks after only having the bench for a week.
5,Great book!,I got this book for my dad because he always knows random stuff and he loves watching the history channel. He's not a huge reader but he really liked this book. It's perfect because the stories are pretty short and to the point so it's not too much reading about each story.
3,Only mildly interesting.,I didn't find this book very interesting. Will give it away. Not worth taking up space on my bookshelf.
5,Interesting little book,"I enjoyed this little book, it has interesting little pieces of history not well known. I didn't sit down and read the whole thing I read one story a day until I'd read the whole thing. The book is in sequence by years and it goes back to the beginning of some of the things we take for granted today I liked learning those little details about the people who were important in those days. I just wish there were more stories I looked forward to reading a little piece of interesting history everyday."
3,Meh,"It was an okay book. It seems to be thrown together in a hurried fashion. I dont regret buying it, but would suggest you borrow it instead. All that being said, some of the stories were pretty interesting."
3,Good Starting Book,"If you are starting your love affair with history, this is the book for you. The ""tidbits"" of history will take through the span of general history and will help you decide your likes and dislikes in history. This is also a good book for anyone who likes throwing around history factoids at dinner parties, luncheons, and other places. For the serious professional historian, this book will not provide a deep and thorough analysis of history, but as a serious historian myself, its a nice book for a bit of light reading."
2,"Interesting tid bits, not much else.","The author did a great job of digging up interesting stories and providing a synopsis of those stories and details, but that is all they are: quick sound bite synopsis's. With a few of the stories that is all is what was needed, but with most I felt I was left hanging on some tantalizing new detail or details with no further explanation or narrative. If this was meant to be a sound-byte coffee table book, then a larger format and more pictures would be suggested.If you are a real history buff, then you might look elsewhere; or purchase this simply to whet your appetite with the fore-knowledge that you will do much more research to get the whole scoop on each ""story never told""."
5,Fun stuff!,A great little book to have around for a quick few minutes of reading. The stories are presented in a short form that provide just enough reading to fill a boring few minutes.
3,Book,"I purchased this book for a History friend. I have to admit I was disappointed when it arrived. It is small. Just thumbing through it and reading the info was interesting...But for a gift, especially for a History Buff, I would not buy. I guess you could call it Trivia for the bathroom...in a hard cover..."
5,"Great Book, Great Gift","This was purchased as a gift and when it came I wanted to keep it, it is a great book. It has alot of interesting information that is great for any history puff. The book is smaller, but the pages are well organized and really draw you in."
5,Book to get preteen into history.,Your kid likes stories and fantasy? Maybe this will turn his head to how amazing real history can be. Worth a try!
5,Charming and Quirky,"I always hated history in school -- and I hardly ever watch the History Channel -- so I approached this book with great trepidation. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself paging eagerly through the well-written, highly entertaining historical vignettes (each one takes up a mere two pages, perfect for subway reading). Some of them made me laugh out loud; once I had to fight the urge to turn to the stranger next to me and ask if he knew what had killed Atilla the Hun. (I'm not telling.) Although not written for kids particularly, this is also a great book to share with older children . . . especially those who complain that history is dull."
3,Where is Disc 2?,"Okay, I'm not really a kid, but I didn't feel like typing in my e-mail address and everything. Anyways, this is a good CD, but I'm not sure about the 2nd Disc because when I opened the CD case there was only Disc 1. There wasn't even a spot for 2 Discs... Does anyone know if you are supposed to send something to get it or what? If it's supposed to be together how is the case set up? When you open the case can you see both CD's or do you have to flip it open and the 2nd Disc is behind the 1st Disc? I'm just a little disappointed it that, but besides that this CD has a few really good songs.I think I'm just going to have to e-mail the company or something about that, but if anyone can answer any of my questions please post it here. Thanks."
4,"Easy music, but still is good!","This album is very good, a lot of acoustic guitar, if you like Brit-pop in general you will certainly like this. The acoustic guitars and 2 or 3 people who sing make a good melody all over the C.D. So take a listen."
3,We can still see the shoulders,"of the giants on whom this band stands. Some nice stuff I suppose, but I kept getting confused trying to figure out just who I was listening to. There is surely something pleasing about listening to seventeen bands at the same time, but Gomez is too derivative to claim to be merely operating under the influence of their forebears. And I disagree with Mr. Gray: I found Liquid Skin more enjoyable and more skillful. I also wonder who this Bob Dillon is. I'm afraid he might be the misspelled twin of another Dylan we know and love."
2,"OK, but nothing like Liquid Skin","This album shows the potential that Gomez has, and Liquid Skin shows Gomez fullfilling that potential. It's not that this album is horible, it's just average. I would recomend anyone interested in Gomez to by Liquid Skin, than once your a fan, go back to this album and prepare to be disapointed. I was atleast."
2,"Sophomoric lyrics, uninteresting sound","Nothing incredibly wrong with this disc, but I found it boring. The singer does nothing to mitigate the fact that he sounds EXACTLY like Vedder, and the lyrics he sings are about as brainless as those of Pearl Jam. This sounds like the work of a few talented kids with a weekend to spare and hormones to burn. There's not a drop of virtuousity in the musicianship and the production adds little else. Songwriting is about on par with Huey Lewis and the News: one unsophisticated catchphrase per song, repeated ad nauseum."
1,Deadly Dull.,"I sold this CD a week after I bought it. With the exception of ""Get Myself Arrested"" this is the dullest album I've heard in years. Only a critic could love this album."
1,hype - lots of it,I don't know why this album is rated so high on the amazon buy lists. it is a poor excuse for music. You can't dance to it. You can't sing with it. It drones on and on. Perhaps I am too uncool to get it but I listened to it twice and it didn't get any better the second time.
5,Is this another Tequila Sunrise for the North West Boys!!!,"Having heard this album over a year ago, I still find it as fresh as ever. The unique blend of mexicana and british humuor leaves me with a somewhat wry smile across my ever effervescent face. From the first track, Get Miles, to the reprise at the end of the cd, one feels that this is a well crafted and well thought out album. In short a great album to add to the collection."
5,"Very good, very mature album","This album should be listened to by anyone who seriously considers themselves to be into rock'n'roll. These guys are great, and hopefully will be even better in the future. 'Gettin Myself Arrested' and 'Bubblegum Year' are absolutely great, and the rest of the songs are really good as well.This band isn't afraid of anything, it seems. They create great sounds for intros, the create beautiful harmonies, they don't follow the classic structure for songs. And unlike so many other bands who try the same things, this works delightfully well.I'm betting, that after another album or two, these guys will be as big as Radiohead, or even bigger. Let's hope that fame won't effect their genius..."
4,Impressive debut,"Gomez is a strange group to describe. They don't just reach out and grab you like some bands. They have a laid-back style that requires the listener interpret the music how he/she likes. I think most people could dig these guys, but I could see how some people wouldn't think too much of them. Personally, I liked them from the first song I heard, 78 Stone Wobble, and I'm getting more and more into them every day. Bring It On has several enjoyable tracks, including Whippin Piccadilly, Tijuana Lady, and Get Myself Arrested, to name a few, but all the songs are good. In my opinion, their second album, Liquid Skin, is even better than Bring It On, and I just bought Abandoned Shopping Trolley Hotline, which is good so far. Gomez was influenced by so many styles that the music could sound like a rip-off of other artists, but they're truly unique and I can't think of a single band that they sound like."
4,really close to 5 star,"I'm really into this. I first heard ""Get Miles"" on the Permanent Midnight soundtrack, then I went and bought both albums. Listening to it, you can hear especially some not-too-recent Blur, Beck, and CSN&Y in the guitar hooks, sampling, and vocal harmonies respectively. But that's not to say they're not original, in fact it's so refreshing to hear roots-based rock that's not played (out) on the radio(knock on wood)."
5,A good listen all the way through,"Rich, diverse, well crafted. There are no throw away cuts on this album. Some tracks may take time to grow on you, depending on your tastes, but if ""78 Stone Wobble"", ""Get Myself Arrested"" and ""Rie's Wagon"" don't have you humming along by the chorus, check your pulse (and pull over to the side of the road), 'cuz you may be dead already. Get in on this band now; they deserve to be the biggest thing out there in the morass of modern music."
2,I went out on a limb and fell on my butt.,"No, I don't really like this CD. The songs 67 Stone Wobble and Get Myself Arrested made me want to buy it. There weren't any others that really did it for me on here, but I'll bet that's because of what I enjoy. I usually listen to OffSpring, Verve Pipe, and Green Day, to name a few. This was just a little too far out of my vain to be appreciated."
2,Doesn't deserve all this gushing praise,"I bought this CD because I liked their ""Getting Better"" lick in the Philips ads so much, I couldn't get it out of my head. I was hoping to hear more of the same on this CD, but was disappointed. I was irritated by some of the intro sounds, especially the long scratching static on GET MILES--it was a pretty disappointing first impression. I do really like one lead singer's voice but now I see this CD is an early effort by a group that will, I'm sure, refine their talents. They'll be world class contenders if they keep at it."
4,Works wonders for my daughter,"My daughter was bought 2 sets of these for Christmas. She is bad about untied shoes. They work great to keep the laces tied. The only drawback is that they lose some of their ""stretchiness"" after a while. Make sure to take the covers OFF of the shoe when they are not on, they will quickly get loose and not work as well.I am going to purchase more for next fall!"
1,Cubbie Bench - Maple,The quality of this product is LOUSY. It is particle board covered with contact paper. The contact paper has bubbles in it and is peeling.
3,Looking for utility at a low price,"Sturdy bench that fits the bill. If you are looking for something inexpensive to serve both as a bench to sit on and a little storage space, this works. We bought this to put in our attached garage and serve as a place to remove your outdoor shoes and put on your indoor shoes, or vise versa, when entering or leaving the house. It works fine for that purpose. As you would expect, at this price, this is not a great piece of furniture. It's all particle board with a thin photo finish that resembles wood. It's easy to assemble and passes the 10 foot test with no problem. It easily supports a two hundred pound person and can store three pairs of shoes, boots or slippers; more if you want to use all the space. I would recommend it if you are looking for utility at a low price. If it's furniture you're looking for, this is not it."
1,Very poor quality material,I received this package and opened it up to assemble. Before even getting it to the final location the rounded front piece had completely broken in half leaving the sides with no hold or stability. The bench is unusable. I am really disappointed that something with such a high price is made with such poor material. I do NOT recommend this bench.
5,LOVE IT!,LOVE IT! It's exactly what I wanted at a much lower price than other stores. I found great canvas pull outs at Container Store. It's exactly what I wanted.
2,"Bench Cubbie, not to shabby","Cheap wood, but I guess I get what I paid for. You only get the cubbie bench, not what's pictured. Shippment cause some minor damage, but can be expected for the type of wood. Overall, not bad for the price."
4,nice sturdy bench,"This bench is very sturdy...unfortunately when we put it together the screws were too long and damaged the top. The supplier quickly shipped me a new top and the correct screws so it was excellant customer service. The finish will probably not wear as well as ""wood"" but for the price it is a nice product!"
4,"Missing Part, But Nice","The bench is beautiful and can be put together very easily. The only thing wrong was that I did not receive the backing in my shipment and had to call to have them ship it. If it wasn't for the shipping error, I would give it a 5 stars."
4,Very nice bench but..,"I really like this bench. It suits our needs- it's sturdy, the storage cubes are large enough for shoes and boots and it can hold me and my kiddos at the same time if needed to. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star is that the hardware it comes with is absolute crap. The top lip that is supposed to be installed underneath the bench portion of this is completely useless to us now because the hardware that was supposed to fit it was shotty and broke.. all four pieces broke before I could even begin hammering them into the bench. They broke while I was simply trying to screw them into their holes! Because they were PLASTIC. They really need to upgrade their hardware for this bench."
2,Cheap price = cheap construction,Fairly flimsy item. You definitely don't want a large guy sitting on this on a regular basis. Finish will lift easily if wet; will need better protection.
4,Great product for the price,I bought this product on clearance for around $100. The quality is great for what I paid and it works perfect in our entryway. Sturdy enough to sit on to put your shoes on or enough space to put work and school bags. The storage underneath is big enough to put shoes or good sized baskets for storage of hats and gloves.
5,Great entry way bench!,We had been looking for an entry way bench for a long time. We loved the Pottery Barn style but not the price. This bench was perfect. Very sturdy and easily put together in about 30 minutes. We would definitely purchase again.
4,Sturdier than expected...,"Great bench - very solid. Only took my husband about 45 minutes to put together. Looks very nice in the entryway. I only gave it 4 stars because it feels a little ""high"" when you sit on it. Obviously, I could have measured the height before I bough it. But with an added cushion, just seems like it's a bit taller than it should be. My husband even feels this way, and he's 6' 2"" tall.Overall, very pleased!"
4,Looks good!,"These look very nice in our living room and so far seem sturdy - at least our 1 year old hasn't managed to destroy them yet. We did have a little trouble with one of the parts being damaged on arrival, but we contacted the seller and they promptly sent out a replacement."
1,Garbage,"I don't review many things. But this warranted special attention. Pieces did not fit well together, and when I complained, Amazon credited me $20 whole dollars!!!! I have bought many things from Amazon, without problems. This product is press board covered in poorly applied, cheap laminate."
4,Very Happy,"This cubbie was shipped in plenty of packing to ensure it arrived without any damage. Once opened, the instructions were easy to follow and setup was a breeze. Assembled, it seems solid and I don't have any concerns with sitting on it. The overall look of the unit is nice and my only concern will be how it holds up to scratching and chipping. When it comes down to it, at around $100, it's a very nice piece of furniture and I'm very happy with it."
4,Good buy for the $,"Love the bench! Not difficult to assemble and can handle a surprising amount of weight. We bought cute target baskets to tuck in the cubbies. Now just trying to figure out what to hang on the wall above since the matching cubbie hook wall mount contraption didn't work out... All in all, a good buy for just under 100 bucks."
4,Superb resource and text for beginning teachers,"I just tried out Mara Sapon-Shevin's new book in an introductory course for prospective elementary and middle school teachers. Students loved this book. They found the brief vignettes at the beginning of each chapter helpful in focusing their thoughts, the sections of each chapter helpful in organizing their ideas, and the games and songs targeted toward the goals of each chapter to be especially exciting and practical. Sapon-Shevin has enchantingly blended theory and practice in a way that was extremely accessible to my students. The themes of the book prompted a number of outstanding action-research projects. I found the students better able to comprehend significant concepts regarding learning and teaching that were hard to communicate in the past. And the students left the course generally realistic about the struggles for inclusive, caring classrooms, yet poised to join the struggle.--Peter Appelbaum, William Paterson University"
1,Many chapters are badly written,"Like all of Professor Nawy's books, this one does not seem to have enjoyed any level of proofreading. There are numerous mistakes and typos.Although the authors included in this book may be experts in their fields, many of the chapters are very badly written."
2,Great Guitarists - Bad Songs,This is a 3 CD set of REALLY obscure songs by three guitar legends. This is apparently a collection of songs they did VERY early in their careers. The sound quality is horrible. It sounds like some guy recorded these off of his old LPs.
4,Not just for kids!,"OK, don't laugh but my sons are 16 and 20. Neither have been cooperative in taking vitamins for several years now. So, I buy these Yummy Bears because the kid in them still loves gummy bears. It worked. They love them! In fact I have to constantly remind them that they are not candy and they cannot take more than the recommended dose. Thanx Yummi Bears. -Mom"
3,Not feelin' the Season 8,"Six episodes in, and I'm just not liking Season 8 at all. The only Season 8 episode that I found decent is Ep03, ""The Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre"". All of the others have just been a total chore to watch - even just once. This is new for me when in comes to Sunny. Some episodes I've watched dozens & dozens of times.I can't pinpoint what I disklike about this season. I guess is it mostly the storylines, but I think there is something else.Take my review with a grain of whatever because it seems that most of the other reviews here are pretty positive. The season is pretty much ruined for me, since it is half over already."
1,Disappointing season opener,"This is one of my favorite shows on TV--however I agree with another reviewer that noted the shift in the show's focus from character based comedy to situational, and the resulting decline in quality. The writing for this episode is slow and labored, and relies on running gags from past seasons. I hope they were trying to give a shout out to the die hard fans, who would have recognized the jokes; but I fear it was just lazy writing. I hope the season gets better, because I am wishing right now I could get my money back for this episode."
3,meh...,"i own seasons 1 - 5 of this on DVD, but since the 6th season, something is missing... don't know what, but just seems meh"
4,Return To Form,It's been a while since an episode of Sunny had me dying from laughter and replaying scenes. This episode reminded me of earlier classics that the last few seasons have been lacking.
3,Still good!,One of the most hilarious sitcoms ever; this season has not been as good as the previous seasons but still really funny
4,So far so good,So far so good for this season. There is a definite feeling that the show is winding down. Some of the episodes are outstanding and some are just phoned in.
3,Is this Sunny?,Its not the same any more. I don't know what's wrong but I hope they fix it. This was better than last week.
3,Season 8 Episode 2,After I purchased the episode I was in a state of panic when I thought I had purchased a previous episode. The recycling of ideas was only slightly funny and thought the overall episode was mediocre. Hopefully this season will get better.
5,Mac is Back!,"Love to see Matt in his old shape, and trying to play the ""enforcer"". LOL I will miss his Chimichanga Physique though. haha."
5,The Gang exceeds their awesomeness,"This season of Sunny so far has been consistently hilarious with the highlight being The Gang Gets Analyzed, best episode ever. I don't think I stopped laughing and/or smiling once."
5,Awesome,"One of the best episodes of the season. Frank is hilarious, but Charlie could've been beter. Otherwise, just great! Keep it going!"
5,Funny as hell,"This is what the show used to be like, and I loved all of it. Funny as hell, just like the first season."
3,Ordinary stuff from a great singer,"Thanks for readingThis is just an OK album in my opinion.Finding his roots as a solo artist, Don Henley just gets better from here. There are some OK songs here, but all sounding a bit dated these days.For fans only!"
5,An outstanding history of the American Revolution,"This is the first book that really makes sense out of the land battles of the Revolutionary War. By centering the focus on NYC, the author shows how the campaigns and battles have a cohesion and rationale in the minds of all of the leaders, on both sides. His explanations of the British failures at Bennington & Saratoga, and of what happened at Brandywine & Germantown, and of the final march to Yorktown are better than I have read anywhere else. I especially appreciate his comments on the stealthyWashington-Rochambeau trek, which so many people portray as if it was a massive, stately one-column victory parade down a fixed route all the way from New England to Virginia."
4,This beast really cooks ....,"This monstrous beast is the largest piece of cookware that we own. Once I manage to wrangle it out from the cupboard and heft it onto the stove, it's many uses range from cooking chickens, small turkeys, and roasts to making potato leek soup. The beautiful thing is that it really retains heat and cooks items thoroughly and evenly. The downside is that it can take a while to heat up, especially since it should heat up on a med-low setting so as not to burn items and/or damage the porcelain. Learned this the hard way by turning up my soup to med-hi in order to get it boiling more quickly (doh!). Now that we know how to properly use this type of cookware, we are enjoying it much more! Another clever use of this piece is to incorporate it into your weight lifting routine (did I mention this thing is very VERY heavy?). Now that we have tried the largest, we have begun collecting some of the smaller pots and really enjoying them."
5,Best French Oven,"I've been looking for a pot this big and I love it. It is HUGE and since I am a hobby cook and, Italian I can make Sunday Gravy put in containers and freeze it and have it on hand all of the time, not to mention how it retains heat. I could go on and on but I think you get my drift."
2,Plot copies Oedipus Rex,"Like some of Stirling's other collaborative works (Children's Hour, etc), this novel is light on original plot.It's well written, but it copies the plot from Oedipus Rex directly.If, like me, you object to paying new money for uncredited, recycled plot, avoid this book."
1,Horrible Customer Support - Not Plug & Play,"The following is the last of my numerous emails to CD Cyclone customer support over a five week period in which I was unable to get my IBM Thinkpad to recognize the Flash Key:""After five weeks of trying to resolve the hardware conflict with my CD Cyclone pen drive I have given up and returned this item. The customer support I received from your company has been horrible. Each of my emails for assistance has taken over a week to receive a response. It has now been two weeks since I have heard from anyone at your company and I can no longer wait to hear back from you again. I asked several times for a technician to call me to discuss the problem, but never heard from anyone. I cannot recommend this product or any other product from your company to anyone.""There are several other companies with similar products for the same or less money. I would try any of them before I purchased this product."
2,Beware if you have widows 98,"When I opened the package I noticed that there was a notice that you needed to download a driver for windows 98. When I went to the site, the title was for a driver for windows 98se. I tried to download but was unsuccessful so I can't tell you if the driver works for windows 98 or 98se. Also note that the item comes with no instructions other than the notice about the driver."
3,Tim Blake - 'Tide Of The Century' (Voiceprint),"I give it 3 1/2 stars.'Tide...' is Blake's fourth solo effort.Released in 2001,think of it as his millenium offer as 'Tide...' is his long awaited follow-up to '91's 'Magick'.Almost as good as his first two albums,'Crystal Machine' and 'New Jerusalem'(see my reviews on both).Outside of being a member of Gong and Hawkwind,Blake has ALSO worked with acclaimed artists Jean-Phillipe Rykiel and former fellow Gongster Steve Hillage.If anything,I believe that 'Tide...' can be considered to be more advanced 'progressive art rock' than his first two titles I've just mentioned.Tracks that make this CD a decent keeper are the title cut ""Tide Of The Century"",the well played eight-minute ""Crystal Island"",the somewhat stunning ""St.Dolay"" and ""Tribulations"".Check out his website.Very eye-catching as well as informative."
4,dark pop,"Skin's solo album is fine;it has lots of really impressive and entertaining moments in her well built songs,and i guess no one can say anything bad about her voice.She is talented,the music is not special;but it is mature and of good quality.Skunk anasie days are mostly over and most of the songs are not anywhere near the definition of ""rock"" except few of them, but this doesnt mean they are bad at all.the album works around personal issues without getting too personal and sticks to the common stories of getting over someone, loving someone,losing someone,being the 'other woman' for someone...You can think of this album as a much darker,much adult version of DDO;it is an honest,nice album;will never make you wrapped around itself but also will not disappear for many years."
4,Still good!,"I was in shock when I found Skin's solo albums because many years ago I heard about her working on them but never got to see them in the stores. Anyways, I'm happy to have heard at least her first one and yes it's true that the rock energy of skunk anansie isn't present but the soul and warmth of the ballads are!I've always been a fan of skunk anansie's ballads and so for me this first solo album is something i can appreciate. There are good solid tracks here so don't get fooled by those who said the opposite. It's just that you gotta accept the fact that Skin was more in the mood to record slower songs at least for this album.If you're a true fan then this is something i'm sure you can appreciate."
3,average,"of course skin has an incredible voice but maybe it's beter to fly with skunk not with her own wings.i give 3 stars for ""faithfulness"" and ofcourse for ""lost""."
1,So-So Album,I purchased this album after hearing the song 'Tennessee'. I listened to the cd only once. The cd just doesn't have enough pick up to keep you interested in a 2nd listening. If and when Marcel releases a 2nd cd I very seriously doubt it would be one I would pick up. As for this certain cd I wouldn't recommend it.
4,Salmon Oil,"Good quality product, no complaints. I don't seem to ""revisit"", digestively speaking, Salmon Oil as much as I do the ""Fish Oil"" products out on the market."
4,"Thought provoking & original, but you'll have to concentrate","From the start, this is an engaging book that captures the reader with an easy writing style and structure. That Strieber is an accomplished author, there is no doubt. This is the first book I have read on the subject of encounters that attempts to plumb the depths of 'why' rather than 'what' and in that respect it is very thought provoking. Strieber has made a commendable effort to present the visitor experience in a new and challenging light, although later in the book, new ideas and philosophies do pop into existence at an alarming rate and can be difficult to follow. On the whole I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to reconcile how the Visitors might fit into New Age thinking, but be warned, you'll have to concentrate hard on the last few chapters."
2,He Lost Me with This One,"""Communion"" changed my whole belief system. It was a brilliant, contemplative and credible account of events that may or may not have happened. ""Transformation"" was interesting but mostly a rehash with a new perspective. This book is where Streiber finally lost me. If he hadn't written this book, I may still be totally convinced by him. When he started this Communion business he was seemed very believably sane, that's what made his story so chilling. I suppose it's possible that it's all true. It' more likely that Streiber is finally losing his mind, maybe the visitors drove him insane, maybe he's simply delusional, or maybe it was a ruse from the beginning. Whatever the case, when I finshed this book, I realized that he had written one book too many on the subject...I didn't buy the next one. but I will read ""Communion"" again...with a different view of Streiber...and see how it plays now."
5,Whitley lets you know you're not the only one.,"Whitley keeps doing it. With each book, he's bringing me past the fog into an area where answers are that I have been searching for. Each time I think I got it, I try yet another one of his books. Lo and Behold. He did it again. I thought that I had to keep searching for the answers in different areas of the paranormal. But, no, he has them there in his books. Perhaps it is more relevant to other abductees. If you are looking for answers to things that have happened to you. You do need his books. You will find out that things you have experienced and don't want to tell anyone about are really common. He tells of other people's experiences. One of his books, ""The Communion Letters,"" is of many people sending in their experiences to share with him. Enjoy!"
2,Not worth your time,"The two stars is only for the interesting accounts of Strieber's encounters with aliens. However, his analysis of the encounters seemed insane. For example, he says that our fear of the aliens will lead to a greater communion. Huh? Strieber also says that the aliens want us to reach some sort of hyper-consciousness, whatever that is, he never said. He asserts this planet will soon be run into the ground by ""exploding population"", and that the aliens are here to save us from ourselves. But the Earth can stand another 14 billion people, and industrialized countries are starting to level out population-wise. And some of his descriptions seem weird, even delusional, like some growling, standing beast with a wand in its hand. The book also seems to have disturbing undertones, giving the aliens some sort of spiritual prowess (for no apparent reason), when they act evil. The aliens must have finally gotten to Strieber."
5,"Yes, Communion must continue!","A fantastic sequel. This book continues the incredible saga of, not simply alien abduction, but spectacular communication with beings whose message is somewhat cryptical but powerful. One senses an undeniable awareness of our need to be connected to a universal oneness. The Visitors of Whitley's ""Communion"" are elusive, controlling, and frightening, yet Whitley's portrayal of their duality shows us a deeply concerned and caring race of beings trying to subtly change our world - one abduction at a time. If Communion wasn't incredible enough, this book is a MUST for your library"
5,AWESOME,"Thank GOD Whitley is a writer! I read the reviews before reading ""Breakthrough."" I almost did not read it. The people that gave it a bad rating most likely have not read many books of one author. Too bad the rating stars only go up to 5. If you have had contact, you can certainly relate to any of his books, especially the ones after ""Communion."" Now that I have found out that reading the bad reviews, can not tell you that the book is bad, why read them? Too bad we do not take an IQ test before writing a review."
3,"Not really a breakthrough, but",still a good book. If you're a Srieber fan add this to your collection.
4,Volcanic!,"This may not be the best book about abductions for skeptics to read. It is more etherial than hard-core technical. Nevertheless, it is worth reading and it will scare the pants off of you...the prospect that this might be real provides the scares."
2,AMISH WOMEN...HO-HUM,"This slim volume of the lives and stories of Amish women is a pleasant work. It is a small collection of interviews and anecdotes of Amish women. The book is a simple, cleanly written work, giving the reader a taste of what life is like for Amish women. It is, however, just that: a taste. There is no depth to this book. It almost seems as if it were a work published by a vanity press operation. It is more like a book one would write and then have printed up in order to give it to friends and family. There is really not too much to it, and it has a certain affectation about it. It piques one's interest but does not satisfy an appetite. It is too bad, because the author herself was raised in an Amish household. Obviously, this gained her entree into this interesting, though narrow world. It is unfortunate that she was not more insightful in terms of her material."
1,disappointing read; Good Books has better books available,"I found this book to be a disappointing read. The writing was simple and lacking descriptions that had depth. Half way through I just put the book down, which wasn't terrible far along, because there was a lot of dead white space between the large font type. I couldn't help but think this book was written by someone cashing in on their Amish ancestors, that they, in this case Louise Stoltzfus, doesn't understand. Good Books has some outstanding books available, I am not sure why they bothered to publish this one."
3,"Unclear audience, but good read.","As I read Amish Women, I felt unsure about what audience Stoltzfus had in mind while writing. The back of the book describes the text in academic language, but the content of the book is not academic. Stoltzfus often writes in fragments, but this lends a story-telling quality to the text. I wonder if Stoltzfus intended this book to be read to children? Either way, this look at the Amish is, unlike many books about the Amish, written not to exploit or exoticize the culture but to honor it."
4,"Savage Messiah, a true account of a hypnotic man","This book was absolutely involving. It took me less than 24 hours to read, I could not put it down. The book is about Rock Theriault,and how he managed to use religion to attract and maintain a ""family"" commune style relationship with several women and men. It describes the abuse and torture the ""family members"" willingly accepted because of their belief that Rock Theriault was being used by God. It covers polygamy, alcoholism, religion (in a bizare sense) and the deep devotion his followers had for him. I enjoyed the book tremendously and strongly suggest it to anyone interested in cults or weird religious groups."
3,Background,"I watched, and then purchased, the movie Savage Messiah. I found it very compelling and, again, caused me to wonder about man's inhumanity. I wanted to know more about how people can allow themselves to be lead to these extremes. The book gave me that information, including pictures of the real people involved in this tragic experience. The book itself is just okay. It's not one I couldn't put down and walk away from, that's why I gave it only 3 stars."
5,DVD,Fast delivery. DVD's new & sealed as noted. Great show. Enjoyed watching the last episodes as if seen for the first time. A classic.
5,Great,Best TV show. Great writing. Comedy is superb. Overall high quality. I wish all TV were so good. Top flight.
5,Awesome,Frasier did not disappoint! If you like Frasier you will enjoy The Complete Final Season. Very funny and worth every penny!
2,Earlier Seasons To Come,"Don't worry. Paramount will go back and release seasons 4-10 onto DVD. That's what they said they would do and I believe them. They're releasing the last season onto DVD, because they want to do it while it's still fresh in people's minds.If it helps, when I heard they were doing this, I wanted to send them a letter saying they're making a big mistake. But I never did."
5,Frasier Final Series DVDs,"Great set of DVD's for any Frasier fan. With Kelsey Grammar and the cast up to their usual (oftimes cringingly) funny antics! Some of the series is produced by Kelsey himself.For those of you in the UK & Europe (as I am) an NTSC capable tv & dvd are essential to play these DVD's.Well worth it, as they are not available over here as yet.A classic series, one that you'll view many times over!"
3,I bought this for my mom,I bought this mainly for my mom. I pick it because I remembered one of the episodes includes was funny. My mom said that the first disk was funny or alright but the other was not and did not want to watch the rest and she is huge Frasier fan.
2,short comment on album 'in question',I think that a good introduction to Roy Harper should include more of his earlier stuff. This compilation focuses too much on Harpers later work.
3,Stick to the History!,"I did not know much about this time in history and found this book fascinating. However, the book's narrative was disrupted in several places by the author's personal thoughts. For example, he talks about Preble finishing contracts on time and then adds that it ""seems incredible in the twenty-first century, when government contract work often drags on past deadline."" Overall, it was a good book that was easy to read, but I would have enjoyed it more with some editing."
3,A little bit dry,This book just never seemed to get going for me and the writing style a little bit dry.
2,Things just arnt as good as we remmember,Its not as good as i remmemberd from high school i use to listen to this for hours now it only took ten minutes then i put it away
3,Just ok,"I bought this album to replace a some songs in my music collection. The best songs on the album are The One You Love, All Those Lies and Don't Give Up. It's ok. I would get his best collection to get all the ""hits""!"
3,A few gems,"""I found somebody"" is a personal favorite, also ""the one that you love"" & ""sexy girl"" are stand-out tracks, but the rest of this is forgettable. Come on Glenn, ""sea cruise"" how lame!"
5,Post Eagles Classic,"This is probably Glenn Frey's best solo studio album. I would recommend this album to fans of the early Eagles. Many of these songs seem like the ones that Frey was thinking of when he left the band. This is Glenn in his early 1980's glory with a number of blues inspired works and collaborations with Bob Seger, Jim Ed Norman and some covers of other artists' songs. This album does not suffer from the somewhat bizarre combinations of songs that seemed to plague a number of Glenn's albums in the mid and late 1980's. There are some well crafted Tempchin/Frey love songs like ""She Can't Let Go"" but there are also harded edged songs like ""All Those Lies."" For what it's worth, this album is generally superior to Henley's ""I can't stand still"" (which is also a good album). In many ways you have to praise Frey's choice of style with this album. This is an album with a number of guitar rock songs in the early 1980's when the synthesizer and techno were really king."
5,Excellent,The first album of Glenn Frey after the break up of the Eagles. Excellent Piece and I've been looking for this on CD for a long time now. Thanks Amazon.com.
2,Caveat Emptor- No Genitive Endings,"As the others have said, the book does not give genitive/gender endings. I don't see how one can learn a word without knowing its declension/gender. Every time you learn a word you will have to look it up in a dictionary to find the gender and declension. Other typos and errors can be found as well. Caveat Emptor!"
2,Full Circle? Not this time...,"Like 'House of cards', I found 'Full Circle' to be yet another disappointing release. Nothing memorable, no hits, this disc just plods along not making much of an impression. I'm not sure when Saga lost their way but these newer releases are not making any kind of impact with me. And yes, I have been listening/collecting since album number 1. Last really good Saga release? For me: 1985's 'Behaviour'."
1,not good at all,"I was very much into SAGA in the early 80's, but forgot about them until a couple years ago. I only bought this CD based upon reviews posted here, and was sadly disappointed. This album is unlistenable, no matter how hard I've tried. The only reason I keep it on my shelf is to have all 16 of the ""Chapter"" songs in my SAGA collection. Skip this one and buy House of Cards or Marathon instead . . ."
4,A good example of Saga's current direction,"I wouldn't say it is one of their greatest albums, but it is definitely a good addition. I am a long time fan that appreciates their style as it has continued to mature over the years. They still have the strong lead vocals of Michael Sadler and the great guitar stylings of Ian Crichton amoung others. If you are trying to decide on a recent release to reacquaint yourself with Saga, I would get House of Cards instead. Worth a listen or two.Cheers"
5,Full Circle indeed!,"few albums are as appropiately titled as this!Full Circle is indeed Saga at its best,returning to its roots musically.Don't wait for US release; order it now! You won't be disappointed!"
3,"This is okay, but it's missing a lot...","It's nice to see some of their best from 1976-79 here. But, really, where's the rest? ""Wasted Time"", ""Those Shoes"", and ""In The City"" are all missing here. And why is ""After The Thrill Is Gone"" here? It belongs in the first collection! I guess it's here because it's trying to make it clear to us that the Eagles broke up at one point. Well, they ARE back, right? Grab ""Eagles: The Very Best Of"" instead of this and it's prequel. That has everything here, and so much more."
5,Can't go wrong with The Eagles,"You can never go wrong with The Eagles, but this album is particularly right. Everything on it is a bonafide hit, and the collection exemplifies the incredible variety of music that they play.Any classic rock fan who doesn't have the money or determination to buy The Eagles's complete works should consider the two Greatest Hits albums as essential; this is what the definition of classic rock *is*."
5,The Eagles greatest,I love the Eagles and they cannot make a bad recording. God Bless them for the great music they have given us all these years. Glenn is such a grand singer and John is wonderful too.
5,Collection of All-Time Faves,"I just started listening American rock around '83. Till then I have already heard and loved lots of their hits without recognizing they are from the Eagles.Hotel California is a poignant song and was hard for me to grasp the meaning and ironies involved. New Kids In Town was and still is my top favorite among this greatest hits package. Seven Bridges Road(in live) is a pure gold track of early Eagles touch. Heartache Tonight take on harder edge having the breath of hard prog/metal era. Comparing with Greatest Hits 1, I still love Vol.1 better than Vol.2 but when asked what is the second bestgreatest hits of all time I would say this one is. If you love great music this one is a must-add."
3,"Good album, though not great.","The evolution that occured in The Eagles' music in the mid-1970's comes through in this CD. Gone is their trademark marriage of western music with rock-n-roll. It is instead replaced with tunes possessed of a crawling pace and tepid feel. Highlights of the CD are ""Hotel California"" and a live ""Seven Bridges Road,"" both of which are excellent tunes and the versions presented herein are equally excellent. This second and diminished greatest hits CD is representative of the band's decreasing popularity in the late 1970's; it has a few gems but as an album is less than spectacular."
4,more Eagles' goodies,"This CD comes in 2nd to Eagles Greatest Hits 1971-1975. However, I'm not disappointed I bought it. Their music is one of a kind."
4,"Thanks to ""Roger Waters""","I know he's not the 'real' Roger Waters, but thanks, Roger, for straightening out the previous reviewer who got all his facts wrong about this being the greatest selling album when even my six year old knows it's the 1975 Greatest Hits album. Look, I like this music a lot, but this particular 'album' was and still is sort of a rip off. All you have to do is get Hotel California and The Long Run, and you've got yourself Volume 2 (Except for ""7 Bridges Road""). Most of us Eagles fans didn't buy it because we already had it. Plus, their breakup was pretty bogus. I mean, what was up with that anyway?"
3,OK for casual fans,"I am only a casual fan of the Eagles, and for my money you can't beat thier first greatest hits CD, but pick this one up too to complete your Eagles greatest hits collection. I got this one mostly for the well known hits to accompany the well known hits from the first disc, tracks like ""The Long Run"", ""I Can't Tell You Why"", ""Hotel California"", etc... but listening to this disc I found some other cool tunes like ""Victim of Love"" and ""Sad Cafe"" so this was worth the $$$. Again I do prefer the first disc but this ain't bad, get it and then you really have all the Eagles you need. My only real complaint with this CD is not seeing ""Those Shoes"" on here. I'm not sure if it was ever a hit but I thought it might be on here. Cool tune by the band."
3,Save Your Money Unless You REALLY Love the Eagles,"I enjoyed the Eagles Greatest Hits Volume I much more than Volume II. Still, however, if you like the Eagles a lot, like me, then there are a few (very few) that I enjoyed."
2,I Can't Tell You Why,"The Eagles were one of the greatest bands of the 70s and most of their releases consist of the bare minimum... skimpy packaging, no historical information, no remastering, just the music. Bands which couldn't hold the Eagles' guitar picks have boxed sets out. This CD consists mostly of stuff from their final two albums. For a better understanding of the music, it is better to buy Hotel California and The Long Run than this."
5,Good classics of the Eagles,"I got this album because my parents own it and figured that I should own it as well. Most of the songs are taken from the most famous two Eagles albums, ""Hotel California"" and ""The Long Run"". The quality of the album was clean and had no skips or scratches. In my opinion this is a good CD to listen to when you are on long sunny road trips out on the western side of the US. A still verry good album to listen to along with this guy is ""The Eagles Greatest hits Vol 1"". I highly recomend both"
5,Great songs and great price!,This is an awesome sound track for any and all Eagles fans! It was such a reasonable price and that made it even more great!
2,A pretty lame collection of songs from a great band.,"For such an awesome first greatest hits album, this one lacks cohesiveness and purpose. All these songs come off 2 albums and the HOTEL CALIFORNIA album is the only notable one. The Eagles are such a great band yet don't include my favorite Eagles song, THE LAST RESORT, on the album. About 5 of these songs are greatest hits material and I think it wa amde to sell a few million copies rather than impress anybody."
5,The Eagles are the best rock'n roll band of the seventies!,"The second definitive greatest hits collection CD album. With all my favorite songs here are highlighted like""New Kid In Town"", ""Hotel California"" and ""The Long Run"" by the voices of Glenn Frey & Don Henley included on all of the tracks!"
1,greatest?,"I believe this is the greatest band around. I just have a big problem digesting this collection. Their first ""greatest"" was the greatest. Here's an interesting twist: I got a Kansas albulm as a gift one time; I took it back (luckily the ""giver"" gave me both the receipt and the record). I took it back in exchange for something much more dulcet: Eagles Greatest Hits 71-75. A relative gave me ""Vol. 2"" as a gift. I laughed, put it in a box, and mailed it to a friend of mine. Some friend, huh? By the way, I love Joe Walsh; I just have a hard time listening to him in this band."
2,Not so great !,"I am not a fan of the band, I have listen to this cd a couple of time and I am not very pleased with it. There is just a couple of good tracks, not enough for me to keep this cd. I will use it as a gift for somebody who will listen to it, because I won't if I keep it."
2,"Sorry to say, this is pretty lame","After the Eagles became ""Walshified"" (this guy's guitar lick ideas are just oh-so-boring to me), the quality fell down. Sure, praise is heaped upon Hotel California, and half of that album is pretty great. But the other stuff from Long Run and their later albums just falls flat.Get Vol. 1 instead, then buy Hotel California."
5,Greatest Hits 2 EAGLES,"This is the second best cd from the great group of the 80's ""THE EAGLES"".. With Glen Frey and Don Henley (?) I hope I spelled their names correctly.. This group surpassed Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons greatest sound , by far... That is a great compliment coming from me... One of the biggest Four Seasons fans ever..Thanks for the great sounds guys... L.W.GEER JR."
4,A decent early live collection from Chicago,"This Chicago set is identical to several other live albums from them. This was recorded in Toronto in 1969, and it shows Chicago during their early years.Needless to say, you get some great live performances. '25 or 6 to 4,' 'Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is' and a great cover of The Spencer Davis Group's 'I'm A Man' all appear on this set.The sound quality could be better, and that's why I am limiting myself from giving the set five stars.Overall, if you're a big Chicago fan and you don't already own these, than buy this set. It's cheap, and you get some historic live recordings.Recommended."
2,Not the mixes we know from back then,"This album is disappointing in two ways:1) It contains some rather underproduced versions of their repertoire, and these do NOT have the full sound like the ones we know from back then.2) The cd-cover is the most horrendous I've ever seen. In fact it's so unbearable to look at, that I've removed it from the box!"
2,Where are the mixes we remember?,"I have to agree with the reviewer below me. The mixes of ""Native New Yorker"" and ""Inside Out"" are ok, but they sound like album mixes - not the mixes you remember from the radio.Except for the above mentioned songs and ""Back to My Roots"" the rest of this album was new to me, and it's okay r&b/disco. ""If You're Looking For a Way Out"" is a pretty song.If you like the famous songs, you'll probably like this whole thing."
2,Luke Warm to Say the Least,"Other than Native New Yorker, a timeless classic and Use it up, Wear it out, a staple in Disco's in the late 70's early 80's, this re-mastered CD is lack luster!"
1,fake,"Yeah I took mine apart only to find the wires didn't really connect to anything, the magnet was really a chunk of steel, and the thing runs off of 2 disc batteries that with an LED and resistor gives only the appearance of holding a charge through a low drain and long battery life. Do not use in case of emergency this will let you down.Thanks to the manufacturer for finding our green soft spot and exploiting it."
1,not satisfied,I bought 3 flash lights from you guys. one worked the second one had a small glow the third did not work at all.I did not open the packages because I was not home when they came so i dont know who each one was from but you need to police the people who you sell for. I DONT THINK I WILL EVER BUY FROM YOU AGAIN!
2,Not so great,"I've found that this flashlight isn't as great as was originally thought. The concept of a 'never depend on batteries again flashlight' is great but this flashlight is not going to be replacing anything in my home. The shaking of the flashlight doesn't hold a charge for very long and despite the LED lightbulb and special lens, the light itself is not very bright. The charge doesn't last very long at all. Despite that, while the body of the light itself may be indestructable, the switch broke off withinn the first month. I've found that crank flashlight last longer, are brighter, and are all around just better eco flashlights and thats what I'm replacing everyhting in my house with. I would suggest everyone else do too. Don't buy this, buy a crank light."
1,No Batteries? Riiiiight!,Appears to take No Batteries. You're just supposed to shake it. On closer inspection it is just a hoax.I bought three and two of them worked. The third didn't hold up to my 3 y/o playing with it but I was able to get it working again. The light switch is a little weak and will probably break again with constant use.And as a children's toy you can't beat the price but don't expect to use it as a REAL tool or for emergencies - it's just not reliable.Not a good purchase choice for those environmentally concerned because once it stops working you just throw the whole thing away! Shaking it doesn't do a damn thing.If you want a good flashlight bargain today I suggest instead you get the 7-LED lights currently selling for about $2.50/ea at most auto parts stores. They REALLY throw some light for the size and you can use standard or rechargeable batteries.
4,Works great for what I need,JJ is right - this flashlight is cheap. It isn't very sturdy. The switch is cheap. The cord is cheap and it doesn't give off much light. But it is exactly what I need time and time again. With a few shakes it is always ready to go. It is perfect for my car or motorcycle tour pack. I have several.
1,Disgusting writing,Movies like this make inncoent insects out to be monsters!This should never sell!Ban all killer bug films!
2,Somewhat painful.,I was very disappointed with this CD. I was hoping for more involved piano playing with more spirit. I couldn't listen to it very long. Felt as if I was at a 3rd grade piano recital.
3,Cool idea - but,"This is a cool idea, but there are a few problems. It only works with JPEGs as far as I can tell, which may not be a problem for some, but I shoot RAW files. The battery doesn't even last a whole day. It loses the signal at times. Although fairly straight forward, linking the images is an extra step. Many photo viewer programs will not report the GPS settings in the properties pane. Last, I had trouble seeing where the GPS points were on a map."
3,nothing special,"As with any Sony product I'm not impressed, doesn't work with mac, the software is too basic and quirkyOVER PRICED"
4,Breakout,"This is my favorite Dokken opus, an album brimming with enthusiasm, one that merges Danish Goth, California Sunshine, and French New Wave. The under-production only adding to its charm, before the band would go corporate big time. This is a band unencumbered with the suits and the bottom line and it shows; there are arstistic choices on here the band would never make again (well..until the 90s, but by then the point is irrelevant), but this is also a band that has its sights set on stardom, a band that feels success around the next corner. A great debut from an LA band with the same kind of crackling confidence as Get The Knack."
2,Rough debut.........,"When I first heard the song ""Breaking The Chains"", I loved it. I thought this band is gonna kick ...!!! Well, the rest of this album is not as good as the opening single. However, while not as polished (or good) as their later albums, this introduced us to Don Dokken's vocals and maybe one of the most underrated guitar players of all time: George Lynch. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves Dokken, but for others I would wait till ""Tooth & Nail""."
5,Number one album,"This is one of the best Dokken albums ever made. I hope in the future they make MORE albums just like this one. If you don't got it in your collection, go out and get it you won't be dissapointed. I promise!"
1,"Less than $3.00, and guaranteed to damage your USB ports.","I thought I was getting a bargain with this horribly designed notebook light. I only tried it for 10 seconds before tossing it in the garbage. BAD weight distribution plus incredibly flimzy USB jack that bends like playdough, can easily damage your computer's USB port as the whole thing pull down on the socket. I did not keep it plugged in long enough to suffer from the consequences later. I gave it ONE star I guess because the light actually works. PAY MORE and get something better, your computer deserves it."
4,Great little light source,"It's what I expected in a small, portable light. Lightweight, and the illumination across my keyboard is good, although I have to bend the arm to get just the right angle. For the price, it's a bargain."
4,Mediocre!,"A good, sturdy little light for a NETBOOK. I would never use this for a full-size laptop because it doesn't light up much area due to a single LED. I would give it a five, but it moves around the USB port when I try to adjust it out of the way... Overall, a very mediocre product for the price."
3,Good product,"It was a good buy for the purpose to view the immediate laptop area in the dark or low light. Easy, plug and play item."
2,Hated It.,"This was cheap, so I thought I would give it a shot, no go. This thing doesnt do the job. Spend the extra cash for a better product."
5,USB light,"This light works great. the stem is sturdy and stays put,the light is not to bright but gives enough to see all the keys on the keyboard. I would recomend it to anyone using a laptop in low light situations."
2,Great Service - not so great product,"While the idea of plug in light for your laptop appears to be a great idea- it doesn't measure up to it's potential. The light source is simply too weak to be very helpful. It provides light for approximately 1/3 of the keyboard and lets you hunt for the other keys in the dark- which is great if you are trying to learn touch typing, but not so great for normal users.On the positive side, the purchase was handled very smoothly with the light being shipped the next day and arriving within a week."
3,already have similar item,already have a similar one that was bought locally at electronics store. the one i purchased was purchased for a friend and it is not as long as the i currently own. i give it a rating of 3
4,Good Product,This is a good product; it works as described. The light could cover a bit more surface area but it gets the job done. I would recommend this item to anyone.
2,Not even worth it,"after about 6 hours of use the bulb pretty much craps out, and leaved this usb light with a dim glow which can only be compared to a glow in the dark sticker, Getting one with multiple L.E.D.'s seems to be a better idea.. spend more, and get more."
1,CHEAP,"I'm stunned that this item received such a high score(reason why I purchased it)! I plugged the light in and it slowly fell to one side! Each time I did this it happened! I will try to figure out a way to use this the way it was meant to be used, but I suggest for those of you thinking about buying it REMEMBER you get what you pay for CHEAP PRICE = CHEAP PRODUCT!PS I'm mad at myself for getting this piece of .... as I knew better!"
1,Piece of junk,"Cheap piece of junk. It flickers and is very, very dim. Don't waste your money on this POS."
4,Ultra USB Notebook Light Almost Perfect,"If you could turn this little light off without having to disconnect it from the USB port, it would be perfect."
1,You call this a light?,You can't see your complete keyboard with this only the size of the circular head!!! USELESS!!! At least it did not cost alot!
2,Stupid and poorly acted...,"Riduculous and overly soapy presentation. The plot and acting will not hold the attention of anyone with a third grade or higher comprehension. Yes, there is some sex/nudity, but not of the principal actors who draw you in from the package. If you like to be entertained AND have some eye-candy, do not go to Dante's Cove..."
5,Dante's Cove,this movie is grreeat the sex scenes and the intrigue into black magic is also wonderful. i love the part where grace neville gets her comeuppance for a little while.
3,"Disappointing - Should take a page from ""HEX""","You know, this show ""should"" be able to offer the same fun that the BBC show ""HEX"" did, but it can't. That show was somewhat light on story (when it comes to its big mysteries anyway), but it doesn't matter because it's so addicting that you can't help but be sucked in. ""Dante's Cove"" has the potential to be such an entertaining guilty pleasure but despite the beautiful bodies and sexy scenes it's all rather dull. Maybe it needs new writers or something (it should team with the creators of ""HEX""). The shows remind me so much of each other in a way but I only wish ""Dante's Cove"" was as cool and addicting. Add the hot sex of this show to the fun of that show and I'd have a new favorite show. As of Season 1 I'm not that impressed though and recommend anyone watching this to give ""HEX"" a shot instead, or as well."
3,Not Bad!,Ok... The show itself isn't bad in terms of the plot and the incredibly hot actors but the ACTING was in one word (HORRIBLE). And the selected music that played throughout the show absolutely SUCKED. I don't think I would want to watch this again unless im extremely bored therefore im glad I made the smart choice and decided to rent this rather than buy it because I deffinitely don't think it is worth KEEPING. In my opinion and advice I would advise you to rent it first before you buy it (if possible).
5,it's one of the hotest show for gays :-),"i've got to say i was a little skeptical about purchasing this DVD but i'm glad i did. it's hot, it's fun to watch and it will make you wanna do some magic :-) go for it."
1,Boring soft core pornography,I thought I was getting a dramatic gay television series like QAF....but it was two boring soft core porn 60+ minute videos. What a waste of my time and money. May have only been 30 minutes each if they removed the soft core porn. The men are beautiful...but I wanted to be entertained too.
3,Move Over Melros Place,The acting is not the best so they made up with hot guys and girls with great bodies. The story line is better then the acting. I would not consider this a season!
3,Queer As Folk It's Not,I Was Waiting For A Good Script This Was NotI Was Waiting For Great Acting The Actors Were Fair/They Need To WatchRalph Richardson And The Complete Cast In THE HEIRESS (THAT'S ACTING)But The Thing That I Disliked Most Was The Soundtrack No.1 You Could Hardly Hear What They Say The Woman Seemed To Mumble/It Was Like Watching A Silent Movie/They Did Improve The Quality On Disc2 Of Season One/But What They Really Need For Future Editions IS SUBTITLES(CLOSED CAPTION)/Last But Not Least The Music Background Was Very Very Bad And Was Louder Than The Actors Speaking Another Reason For Subtitles//This Was A GoodIdea And Perhaps Someone With Imagination Will Do It
1,Convoluted Ridiculous Adolescent Plotless = CRAP,"You want a synopsis - weird and stupid.Is it worth buying? NO!!! Is it worth renting? ONLY if you are desperate and have watched everything else including teletubbies tv show or re-runs of Dallas!!!Overacting R Us should be the by-line. Move on, find something decent...don't waste any part of your day on this."
4,Great Triller Movie,This movie was awesome great different moments in but the bad thing is could not see thier peins.LOL
3,Entertaining,"This movie/series is fun to watch: Great locale, sets, make up and story line. The performance of some of the actors is not too convincing giving the impression of not being too convinced about the project."
2,i didnt think this would be soft gay porn,"yeah, i never heard of this show before. we wouldnt really get this aired in europe. so i took a chance and bought this. the opening scenes of the show kinda summed it up for me. its hammy acting with pretty boys and lots of soft gay porn. not really into it. it would have been better without the soft gay porn."
1,an excuse for faggy soft pron with a bunch of effeminate guys,this is one of the most atrocious excuses i have ever seen for a bunch of sissies who want to have sex with each other. better they made a straight porn movie--the garbage with the vampire woman is too much--whoever made this crap is a moron a user and a complete idiot--whovere watches this and thinks it's cool and good is the same.
2,Truly shocking,"I think I can unequivocally say this is the worst writing on a TV show that I have ever encountered. The acting and dialogue are, as I said, truly shocking in how bad they are. The only thing that saved it from one star for me was the mildly hot sex scenes. Anyone expecting something on the level of Queer as Folk will be disappointed."
3,"weak, but fun","The first scene man-to-man is quite explicit. The lover's toy is long and quite ""cheerful"". But that's all for the whole box. It's entertaining. I enjoyed it. However, it lacks what has promissed, more skin and hot scenes. Okay, there's skin, but I would not say it was hot. So, be aware."
5,Grande Dante,I loved this movie or seres it is wonderful. I thank Amazon for making this experience available to me. You shoul be too....
4,Dante's Cove Has Some Mystery In It,"I did not know what to expect of this gay series. I found it quite entertaining, and I am anxious to see Season Two. The mystery part of the Cove family of functional and dysfunctional gay and lesbian lives is a welcomed relief to softcore gay porn movies."
2,I'll give it a second chance,"I liked it, but then again, it had lots of problems...overacting, too much unnecessary sex/nudity, stupid dialogue, silly (contrived) conflicts, etc., etc.... but the fact that I'm waiting for the second season DVD, says that on some level it caught my interest, which is why it gets 2 stars."
2,Oh brother!,"I didn't think series as bad as this were still made. If you take away the gorgeous bodies, handsome faces and great hair you have next to nothing. Although much of the acting is very poor, no one can blame the actors for such a truly lousy script.I will buy and watch Season 2 to be supportive of the new genre, but really...you can do better than this!"
5,"I HAVE TO SAY , DANTES COVE IS EXCELLENT","I AM LIVING IN CANADA AND MY FRIEND TURNED ME ON TO THIS PROGRAM. ITS A CROSS BETWEEN MELROSE PLACE, MEETS BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER WITH A LITTLE BIT OF QUEER AS FOLK.THE ACTORS ARE HOT, AND THE WOMEN ARE ATTRACTIVE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MORE SERIOUS BODY OF WORK, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. BUT THIS PROGRAM IS A FUN SHOW. I HOPE ITS HERE TO STAY."
4,Gay Sex in the Shadows,"The main reason to have a permanent copy of Dantes Cove is that the male leads are super hunky when having erotic gay sex in the midst of a witch epidemic. The actors were obviously chosen because they are all handsome hunks, and just as obviously failed to pass acting school. But why worry about such issues when you have the opportunity to have a gay version of the cult classic Dark Shadows. I think it is also nice that the lesbian characters get to have as much on air love making time as the guys. My favorite character is the tortured soul Kevin, cute, blond, and seductive, equally matched by his confused but muscular boyfriend Tobey. The names for both of the actors who play these parts are composed of two masculine, first names, ergo, these guys don't really want their moms to find out that they star in a gay soft porn film."
3,Sex on the Beach,"This show has some horrible acting, but that is not the reason you are watching this. The guys are hot and the nudity is a plenty. The storyline actually has some merit to it. Homo from the past comes back to haunt the beach he once cruised. Falls in love with current homo boy and the conflict begins. This is some good gay, erotic, soap opera material. If nothing else, I enjoyed all the skin.Buy it."
3,HOT BOYS! DUMB STORYLINE!,THE ACTING IN THIS SERIES IS NOT THAT GREAT BUT THE BOYS ARE HOT AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF SEX SCENES AND FULL FRONTAL NUDITY. GOOD ENTERTAINMENT!
4,really good buy,such a warm bag! I love using it. Some nice little pockets around the head for various things you need in the middle of the night as well. Great value for the cost.
5,Great Work!,This is a wonderful approach to the fairy tale stories. I've read several of Mrs. Capps-Burgess books and all of them are excellent! They make extra special gifts for the young reader.
4,Brought Back Memories,"Whippins, Switches, and Peach Cobbler is one of those books that really brought back a lot of good memories. This is one of those books where I could kick back, read, laugh, and enjoy. I really loved Benny's character and I loved how he respected his parents, although he might not have agreed with them in every instance. This is one of those good books that made me think about stuff (like my childhood, for instance) that I usually do not think about on a day-to-day basis and it also made me thankful that I grew up with good and loving parents. The other thing I really liked about this book is the fact that there weren't hardly any curse words in it so this is a book that I could enjoy and then I can give it to my mother to enjoy. Readers searching for a nice family oriented story should definitely give this one a try."
4,Inspirational,As a teen in 2000 I relate to the book in more ways than one. Egeston has shown that things may change in time but the basics never change. I appreciate the way he uses dicipline to convey that message of love and support that a family gives to any well rooted child. A work of art made only by a true artist. This is a prime example of not judging a book by its cover. The warmth and family value this book possess makes you think. I thank him for the experience and I can't wait for the next release.
5,"I Laughed, I Cried: Two Thumps Up","Whippins Switches and Peach Cobbler is a refreshing and honest look at everyday life and centers around the basics of what truly makes us whole: love, family, communication, trust. The book will strike a chord in anyone who has ever been to a family reunion, had an argument with someone they love, watched their child leave the nest, or watched someone they love pass on. This is stuff life is made of, the moments that make us who we are. It's what we come home to. Excellent work from a new author."
4,Took me back!!!,"I had the pleasure of meeting Brian Egerston at a writing conference, where I purchased a copy of Whippins. This book took me all the way back to my own childhood and showed what today's society is sorely lacking (man, I can still feel those switches...). The characters all exist in our family trees SOMEWHERE, and even the secondary characters are vibrant. Brian does a nice job of examining both parent/child, romantic, and extended familial relationships. There is a nice twist at the end of the book involving one of the main characters, Benny. When he gets into the car chase and then has to rush to the hospital because...well, you gotta buy the book to find out! Trust me...you won't be sorry! Hungry, but not sorry! :)"
2,"Great stuff, don't get the foam.",I bought this to recondition my leather jacket. The foam is really hard to spread and I ran out halfway through. After drying my jacket was splotchy and half done. For shoes this would be a nice product but for jackets no. If you want to recondition a jacket get the spray bottle version. It works great!
3,"Nice & thick, but not durable","I've had this mat for about nine months and use it twice a week for power yoga. It was great at first - nice and thick, but not too spongy or soft. Now the top layer is wearing slightly where I put my feet and hands and I get little black mat pills on me during the workout. Also now that the mat has aged some I've also noticed that it has some stretch where before it didn't stretch noticeably. And it's getting lumpy. I do store the mat rolled up laid on the floor and change rolling directions after every use.Overall this is a good mat, but pricey for the short time it's lasted with my usage conditions. What the photos can't tell you: 1) This mat is one sided only. 2) The reinforcing mesh is close to the top surface of mat, not in the middle. 3) The mat doesn't slip much even now."
1,This cannot be legit!,"Since this product is available from Amazon as well as several other retailers, I figured it was a legitimate recording. Now that I've played it, I'm not so sure.This certainly is a recording from a live concert. But it was not recorded professionally. The sound is murky and indistinct, as if the microphone was in someone's purse. I cannot imagine anything that sounds this bad being anything but a bootleg. If Rick Wakeman approved of this use of his material, he never heard it. Nobody in their right mind would.It's very difficult to discern the music from the interference. If you're a fan of Rick's earlier works (and you would be to be interested in this recording), you will be disappointed. Even the titling of the tracks is wrong.This rot is unworthy of even MP3. And it's an insult to anyone who bought into the DVD-A format because of the superior audio quality. It's trash."
5,Classic Album from Lionel Richie,"I use to play this Album all the time. Lionel Richie, aside from Michael Jackson was the most important Cross-Over Artist of the 80's. Lionel Richie did it all. and just like MJ he was Successful in a Group&then went Solo&turned it up a whole different notch. Lionel Richie truly shines on the Classics ""All Night Long"", Penny Lover,Penny Lover. but my main cut on this Album is ""Love will a Find a way"". that Groove is wicked. then of course the Telephone Anthem ""Hello"". that video is still cold how when he talks to the Chick he just breaks it down like a true Mack. ""Hello!!! is it me your'e looking for?? that was on point. Lionel Richie is a great Musical Force. on the real alot of Artists would want to have his Career. Lionel Richie did it the right way. this Album was OUTRAGIOUS!!!!!!"
4,"""The only one"": Great song!","""The only one"" is one of my favorite songs of all time. ""All night long"" and ""Stuck on you"" are really gorgeous. But I can't stand ""Hello"", it's too silly!"
5,The Only One,"This album is timeless. Like Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"", the album is mostly a greatest hits collection. Lionel is simply a true artist. Throwing in R&B, rock, country, and funk all in one collection with gorgeous poetry and a gorgeous voice makes for a dynamic album. One thing I must point out is that not many of Lionel's compilations feature this original version of ""Penny Lover"", which is the most beautiful one in my opinion. Another plus are the 3 tracks that didn't make the radio - the title track, ""Love Will Find a Way"", and ""The Only One"". These cuts are wonderful and don't even come close to being filler tracks. Pick this gem up and let Lionel take you away."
2,I wasn't impressed,"Bowling Strikes was off to a great start. It jumped right into the mechanics of bowling in good detail. Suddenly, after 30 or 40 pages, it just died. It almost looked like the author became bored and just wanted to throw another hundred pages on to make the book longer. A good portion was spent displaying almost every possible spare. First of all, with the title being Bolwing Strikes, was was there more space dedicated to picking up spares? I would have rather the author diagnosed precisely what caused the spare and options to correct your throw rather then spending a page on how to pick up the 6-9-10! Even stranger, the author assumes you're advanced enough that you throw a hook, yet spends several pages on ettiquette, how to score, and injuries. The first 20 or 30 pages have some helpful tips, but you're better off spending the money on practice. Best suited for someone who just bought a fingertip ball and wants to learn how to hook."
4,Skunk review,"I purchased the stuffed skunk as a joke for a friend. However, I was very pleased with my purchase. It shipped very quickly and is larger than I expected and very soft. I'm sure any of the other animals would be just as good."
4,Great Series for Teens,"I read everything Asimov(or Paul French..his alter ego), (Science Fiction Wise) and love this series. This book I am reviewing is in Paperback Form and has two stories, which made the price so much better.These books (and the series) was written in the late 50's, so the knowledge of these planets are before the various probes went to these planets, and most observations were visual. This is Science FICTION and the older info does not detract from the stories.You can see he likes to write these, since they show his love of mysteries (his other ""life"") and the Robot Novels.Both books are very good, and if you read the books in progression, they are excellent for the younger readers in which they are written. Yes they are dated, but then again so what? So is Shakespere. I just love to read them."
5,Very worth reading to understand Dickinson Better,I can't get enough of Dickinson biographies recently. Connie Ann Kirk's portrait of Emily Dickinson is very worthwhile; not sensationalistic but very grounded.
4,"I love it, but you can't hear what Agata's doing too well","It was much better live. Agata is God. The little studio tricks make it worth buying, but they are the best live band ever. Planet Q was amazing live, I found it a bit more lo-fi and less sci-fi here."
2,When was this written?,"I don't think you could get away with most of this stuff anymore.Concerning airport security, etc...It proposes some good ideas on how to save money, but it's nothing you haven't thought of before.Scan it in a store, it's not worth buying."
4,"Solid, pretty","The company was out of stock at first, but after a few email exchanges to cut through some institutional hassle, their customer service chick stepped up and got us the tables. These are much more solid than similar products we've used. Rather than simple screw-in joints, these have diagonal cross supports at the joints, too, and dimensions that make them hold up longer than the last set we had. Our two kids are rough on furniture, but these are very pretty, simple, and super durable."
3,and then the strangest thing happened,"A collection of twelve short story chapters, truly tall tales derived from the Upper Midwest region and Mississippi River area. Stitched together by a common setting, a park in Muscatine, Iowa. Each story follows one of two similar outlines in presentation. The rather predictable bantering conversations between four aged companions seated on a bench beneath a sycamore, or a group of young lads listening to ol' Hiram the park attendant, by the lagoon. Spoken folklore surround cultured pearls, vicious snapping turtles, chicken thieves, a large dancing crayfish, a mammoth snow goose, a winking mermaid, ghosts, and two creatures (man & reptile) that survive frozen hibernation.Old fashioned style storytelling done in print. Completed with strategic black & white illustrations on every page. It's an okay book, basic simple fiction comprehensibly written, ideal for leisure tidbit reading while recreating on the water."
1,Didn't suit my needs,"I have peripheral neuropathy. We're not sure why but I might have something called Vitamin B6 toxicity. This was recommended to me to help get rid of toxins from my body.For me, it didn't seem to do much except cause constipation and cause even more neuropathy. I had hoped it would relieve my pain but it just made it worse."
2,"This stuff is good on penne, but won't you get drunk.","The truth in advertising police should go and knock down the door of the Antica Italia Pasta sauce company. When I drink flavored vodka, I expect to be able to shake or stir, but this stuff is too thick for drinking. I added tonic, ice, and a lime, but still to no avail. Try Stoli or Vox instead."
3,Authors ain't supposed to write reviews on themselves here!,"The book is good and helpful, especially for beginners and I'm buying it, BUT! The author wrote a review on his own book in here! That is low and authors have their own place for reviews on amazon so that they dont' skew the ratings in their favour. I'm buying it right now, and I will go back with more to report. It does look good though, or I wouldn't be bying it."
3,Designing with Type,"The item arrived in a short time and is in fair condition. Unfortunately, I don't believe this is the edition I wanted and I believe I checked the listing at the time I bought it and the cover photo was different, I think. Oh well. I must have the latest editon for my school class, and I will get it, but I am going to keep this one also. Good reference book."
2,Good book but skewed reviews,"I believe that this is a good book, but I really don't appreciate when authors themselves or other supporters with a conflict of interest write rewiews that are clearly biased and unethical.Althought one must expect a lot of this kind of crap on a commercial book selling site such as here, I do believe it is up to each and everyone of us to rise to the challance of higher values and ethics, which in the end is beneficial to all. I also believe that educator have particularly great responsabilities in this area! You should know better...thank you for your understanding.R. B."
4,Good for the DIY guy,"Having to do a few more projects involving drywall than normal I decided to give this drywall dimpler a try to see if I could make my life easier. Using an 18v cordless drill driver, the drywall dimpler put in 2.5 inch screws easily and with zero tear out, with one caveat. You must be truly perpendicular, or close to it, in order for the clutch to hit the drywall flush and disengage. Otherwise there was some tear out. A good eye is useful with this bit. This drywall dimpler is perfect for those who don't hang drywall for a living and only need it for around the house repairs or single room renovations. If drywalling an entire house I'd definitely invest in a power, drywall screwdriver."
2,Am I using it wrong?,"Based upon all the positive reviews, it may just be me but I used this for the first time this weekend and kept getting very inconsistent results. I don't know why but some screws didn't go in far enough, others went in too far...I'll update when I use it more, assuming I figure out how to use it differently."
4,Intriguing Words,The chants and hymns in this small paperback prompt pondering about God and Jesus. A meaningful way to reflect on truth.
2,NOT FOR SINGLE MOTHERS,"THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK IS MISLEADING. THERE ARE ONLY 4 OR FIVE AREAS THAT REFER TO DADDY. BUT, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A BOOK ABOUT MOTHER AND CHILD. NOT MOTHER,CHILD AND DADDY. OTHER THAN THAT, THE BOOK IS NOT THAT BAD. IT IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA. I SUGGEST SCRAPBOOKS."
3,OK but...,"Thought it was interesting that all of the other reviews are by kids who know Andrew personally...This book was bought for my school library and I quickly realized that all of the information given is available in almost any encyclopedia or website. Token details on each country and while the information is there and in one place, it really isn't worth the purchase price.I showed it to our geography teacher and he basically said that it was OK, but certainly not something he would use a lot."
2,"Somewhat useful, but I could have written this....","I purchased Afghanistan to Zimbabwe last year along with other study resources before the bee season. I use it often, now that I'm preparing for the State bee, but as I look through it I realize that everything in the book is from an almanac or World Factbook. There is no information in the book that takes more than a tiny bit of researching, it seems like the author copied it right out of the almanac. Come to think of it, I could write something like this, and I've never won the National Geographic Bee. Afganistan to Zimbabwe has limited information, although I must say it is still useful and I can't say putting this book together was easy. It is a somewhat helpful but very unessential study guide."
5,Interesting...,"I was roommates with the author at the 2004 National bee, and while he was away getting interviewed, I managed to sneak a peek at his book. I was overwhelmed by the information presented in just the first few pages I read, and while I have yet to read the actual published work, I can definitely say that this book is an asset to any geography classroom or geobee contestant, and that the author deserved his win (well, maybe I deserved it more :-P)."
5,Compelling Personal Narrative,"Jasper Rastus Nall was my great-grandfather and I am very moved by this thought-provoking book. Although this diary has circulated the globe and was entered into the Library of Congress, it was intended for a much smaller audience, his descendants.J.R. Nall was born into slavery, but says he ""never slaved any."" He never attended school, but eventually learned to read and write and caught most of his education ""in the air."" Throughout most of his life he knew nothing but hard work and dedicated himself to the education of his six children. He was most proud of his work in building a school in the town where he lived, and claims to be the only man who saw his wife and all of his children educated there.His myriad jobs included miner, butcher, and mailman, just to name a few. What J.R. Nall lacked in formal education, he made up in common sense. His values of honesty, morality, and commitment, are a model for all generations to follow."
1,Boooooring....,"Don't waste your money and time on this one.No disernible plot, little character development, no consequence.Ignore the hype, there's nothing here."
2,Listenin' to GramPa,"Subtitle is ""A story about two boys growing up on the old family homestead in Cochise County when Arizona was an infant state"" and that about tells it! It reads like someone sat down with their GramPa telling stories and then transcribed it--really good oral history technique. Includes author's growing up & moving to Stockton, CA. Good for researchers of local history looking to confirm stories."
4,great book,"Mr. Flynn did an awesome job describing his times with the Pope and the Pope himself. I mostly enjoy the short stories that Mr. Flynn shared in the book. Unlike other writers, Mr. Flynn did not describe what a great man the pope was, but shared awesome stories that painted how awesome the pope was."
1,Sail Magazine - mediocre,"Sail Magazine is a ten-minute read then toss it. I cancelled it after a year.Look, my opinion is just my opinion. Almost all magazines today are almost all advertising; either overt ads, or covert advertising disguised as articles and reviews about new products. I spent ten minutes every issue reading a few columns written by famous names such as Nigel Calder et. al and that was it. I've read their books for the most part anyway, so these few useful parts were not worth the $10 a year subscription fee, so I cancelled it.Your mileage may vary.But advertising can be informative if read with discrimination, especially if you are new to the sport and want to get an overview of what's going on commercially. I am old enough to remember when the America's Cup was a contest between boats and sailors, not between computers and lawyers, so my viewport may be very different from yours. Fair winds."
4,Sail Magazine,Good value for magazine. Very informative and good reading for all levels of expertise . . . from beginner to professional
3,Best of a weak lot,"I resubscribed to Sail recently after some years without the magazine. I also subscribe to Yachting World which is the absolute best sailing magazine I have ever taken and Good Old Boat which has some very well written regular features. By comparison to YW,kind of apples to apples, Sail is weakly produced and written. It lacks generally compelling monthly columns and many times it seems sort of dumbed down. But it is a decent resource for the US based sailor and its far better than say Cruising or US Sailing."
3,sail magazine,"Fairly good magazine. The articles are short, interesting, and often include sailing stories. SAIL could use more hands on information. Overall evenly balanced between stories of interest, and ""how to"" articles. SAIL seems to be targeted at the middle class boat owner. You may need to subscribe to a mag more focused on your particular needs or two to three magazines on sailing."
2,This book is out of date and myopic,"I was really looking forward to reading this book because I agree with the premise but needed some practical suggestions on how to raise my children apart from mainstream culture.However, this book was published in 1975 and all of the findings presented are from 1973 and earlier. Since then, those who want to push kids harder and earlier have published so heavily that their findings are considered fact and the studies in this book seam out of date and long forgotten.I also have a problem with the disrespectful over generalizations that the authors make about their opponents and parents who follow there advice. In flipping through the book I couldn't find any of the examples that I wanted just now. I did find plenty of examples of ""some children may feel... therefore everyone should refrain."" I agree with the statements made but not with that method of justification."
5,A TRUE COLLECTOR'S ITEM!,"This is a true collector's item and I am sooo glad I have it! Vikki is hot! She is clearly loving it and having a great time with her guests.And you even get to see her parents in the crowd! Piel Canela, Perfidia, Frenesi, Magic Is The Moonlight are some of my very favorites but each and every song is excellent. You will watch this over and over again and never tire of it. If you get the chance to buy this, do it. You won't regret it."
4,A sad and fascinating story,"Imagine losing your senses one by one, how terrifying it would be, and the repercussions of not having the sense of smell, taste, hearing, and sight. That is the epidemic depicted in this existential horror/dystopian film, where many, if not all, people in the world are afflicted. We focus on the relationship between an epidemiologist and a chef who are both infected and go through the rigors of the illness with each other. There is no explanation of what causes the problem, which adds to the tension."
5,Can't stop thinking about this wonderful film... see it!,"I saw this movie two days ago and I can't stop thinking about some of its messages and images. The leads Green and MacGregor are excellently cast for their roles. The leads are very attractive people but do well in conveying that they are just two ""ordinary"" people going through an extraordinary event.The movie has two levels...the lead characters' experiences with the changing world (and each other) and the effects of a plague on the world at large.I don't want to give away the plot but what was most moving to me was seeing how some people reacted to the plague w/violence and destruction and others helped their fellow man and found beauty in what remained.Let me know what you think after you see it."
3,Perfect Sense,I liked the movie. It made me think of movie Contagion. I was just okay...Nothing really special about this movie.
4,"Thoughtful, moving film","This movie is really different than what the ""cover"" art implies. It is a love story, but it's about much more than a sexual relationship. The film is very different than many I have seen. I definitely recommend it - the story and images stay with you long after. Beautiful cinematography."
2,Only for those who earnestly seek hope,"Perfect Sense is perfectly awful. It's about a chef (Ewan McGregor) and an epidemiologist (Eva Green), two people who go for each other but who have major relationship problems. They find themselves in the middle of a worldwide epidemic -- after crying a bit people lose their sense of smell. Then taste. Then hearing. Then sight.What can the world do? What can humanity do? What can Michael and Susan do? The answer, my friend, is written by a deeply earnest screenwriter and filmed by an otherwise interesting director: Love each other...take care of each other...trust each other. All this is accompanied with a deeply serious voice over that makes sure we understand the importance of what we see, along with a music score that drips with tragedy and then hope.To watch an infinitely better movie by the same director and also starring Ewan McGregor, try the excellent and unpleasant Young Adam."
1,Whaaaat?,"Due to the positive reviews I went ahead & watched this & all I can say is im thrilled so many did like it but I personally HATED it. It was rather boring & depressing.I kept watching & waiting for it to get better but it just never happened for me.I wanted to change the channel numerous times but kept forcing myself not to since the positive reviews gave me hope that if I kept watching, I would be glad I did.It just never happened & again, all I can say is glad others liked it but I would rate it negative stars if I could.Just horrible IN MY OPINION..but different strokes for different folks is always the rule. Obviously some liked it based on the reviews, but I thought it was one of worst movies I have ever watched & actually wished I had not wasted 1 second on this trash.But, I do rec folks watch it themselves & form their own opinion."
2,Too too. Beautifully shot and erotic...but pretentious.,"There are interesting ideas in ""Sense,"" and the performances are uniformly excellent, as is everything from the sets to the musical score, but I found it ponderous, pretentious, and ultimately unappealing. Another reviewer said it's hard to categorize, and that's true, although not necessarily a bad thing. Pressed to find a category in which to put ""Sense,"" I list it withChildren of MenandBlindness, which to my mind were both superior films to this one. I think what ""Perfect Sense"" might have been TRYING to be more like isNever Let Me Go, which is in every way better than ""Perfect Sense."" If you haven't seen ""Never Let Me Go"" yet and have a choice between that and this--do yourself a favor and go with ""Never."" (But if you're in the mood for sluggish sensuality and diffuse prettiness, you could do much worse than ""Perfect Sense""--if you can stand being merely engaged rather than rapt, it will do.)"
2,DEPRESSING,"Depressing, no closure at end, only good thing about it is Ewan. Sorry I wasted my money. Almost fell asleep watching it."
5,Just...wow,"I'm not sure if I've ever seen a movie that has so profoundly moved me. It was well acted, wonderfully written and directed, and astonishingly edited and shot.The thing I don't like is how people are reacting to this movie and how the movie is being marketed (which might be connnected). It's not saying ANYTHING about the kind of feelings and emotions this movie brings up in such new and ingenious ways.I hope this movie gets much, MUCH better marketing when it comes to the US."
4,Was not what I was expecting,"Surprising, I wanted to watch a steamy romance, but it is a futuristic portrayal of the downfall of the human race, in a very creative and surprising way. Very good movie."
5,beyond the end.,"This is a provocative and thoughtful movie about the loss of senses. Well written, cast and performed, this movie might drag you somewhat unwillingly into what it really means to be a sentient being. But the journey proves to be well worth it."
4,Creative concept for a movie,"This was a well made, well-acted movie about how people respond to losing their senses. It explores different aspects of human nature - both the positive and negative sides. There are some nice cinematic moments as well."
2,unexpected,Weird movie. I enjoy Ewan McGregor in just about anything. Thought it was going to be more of a love story.
2,skip it,Only if you are an Ewan McGregor groupie and have nothing to do should you spend time watching this. It will put you asleep better than any drug.
3,Perfect Sense,Well acted film that places a heart in an end-of-days sci-fi backdrop. McGregor and Green has a lucrative chemistry compared to any Jane Austen made-for-film.
5,True Pulse,"This album was indeed a reggae classic, and also one of the very best albums that Steel Pulse ever recorded. They were a British band with Jamaican roots, and their blend of old and new reggae styles perfectly gelled on this masterpiece. Clever lyrics, seductive beats, and that familiar reggae styling. Not a weak spot on here. Even if you aren't much of a reggae fan, this album is well worth a listen. Nothing strange on here that will turn off some listeners, such as a bunch of spacey dubs or dancehall silliness, just very good reggae music."
5,Love this game!,"It may be an old game, but i love it! There are different modes to play and multiplayer is very fun. Not many people like it because i beat them all the time but I don't know why i just love it!"
2,Broken but refunded,"They should test products before being sent out, packaging was good though. Such a good game I was disappointed when I heard the rattling."
2,Poorly Engineered,"I have Several Paul Carrack CD's from Ace,Mike & the Mechanics,Beautiful World and Blue Views.""It Ain't Over"" is the worst engineered of them all. And that includes ""The Best Of Ace"",which has some tracks which seem to be taken from LP's. Several of the tracks start after the band starts playing with that annoying sharp sound of a beginning that starts in the middle of a note. The songs are just ok but the man or woman on the mix board killed any enjoyment one may have gotten from this CD.Just for the record I have Conrad Johnson Premier 12 Tube Amps driven by a Sonic Frontier SLF2 tube pre amp. This is a full price CD not some dollar download with half the musical info missing, It should be engineered accordingly"
2,Welcome to musical oblivion,"In recent years, Carrack has been busily whittling away all the characteristics that made him unique. He has succeeded. Now each of his songs plays as if created by a focus group of Adult Contemporary listeners. Listening to this bland soup, one would never know that Carrack is (was?) a superior keyboard player, or that he made a fine album like Suburban Voodoo. This effort reminds me of Karl Kraus' aphorism: ""She lacked only a flaw to be perfect."" Like a person who has all distinguishing characteristics removed by plastic surgery, Carrack no longer has rough edges, or a reason to be taken seriously as a musician. Compare his slide into oblivion with another long-time pop artist, Robert Palmer, who never stopped taking chances, and went out on a distinctively creative high with his CD ""Drive"""
1,Don't Buy This,"I am a huge Oasis fan, I thought this video would be awesome. It has zero interviews from any actual band members. I think they have a small maybe 25 second comment from Noel as he is walking out of Heathrow or some airport. Other than that the DVD talks to friends of the Gallagher brothers and random people that met them during their rise to the top of the 90s Brit Pop era.You are better off looking up info on Oasis on wikipedia or the band's website. Don't waste your money. And if you already have - Stop Crying Your Heart Out."
3,Okay,"SW was a well written mystery by Paula Woods and she has created a character who is very likeable and is highly driven in her job as an LA Homicide detective.The book has way too much dialogue but not enough action scenes, however. Also, there were way too many characters in which to keep track making it hard to follow."
3,Not sure,Received the tuning hammer. I expected it to be brass colored from the photo on Amazon. What we received was chrome colored.
4,"Good hammer, but not brass as stated or shown","I had read the previous review that said they ordered the brass hammer and instead got the chrome. I knew this was a risk but ordered anyways because I dont mind chrome. Just letting everyone else know, now 2 of 2 people have ordered brass and gotten chrome. This company also sells a chrome model on Amazon. but the invoice that ships with the product just says Tabla tuning hammer. If you are set on brass, do not buy this tuning hammer."
5,great for clear thinking,this product really helps with congnitive thinking and really works taken as directed - a bit pricey but worth the cost
5,Great for us,"These are great for us. We have other sand toys so these will be good for our beach toy collection. They may not be the best, but for the price we think they're great."
2,Cheap,Item was not as described and toy shapes were not as shown. A tiny sea creature in place of a castle shape? Go to the dollar store for the same value.
3,Good for the price - MADE IN USA,"MADE IN THE USA! I think this is a decent toy for the price. My main concern would be the durability. It feels a bit cheap because the plastic could have been stronger/thicker, so I'm knocking one star off the overall rating for that. I'm knocking another star off because it's not a toy that my kid plays with that often... so final verdict is not bad but not great either. It's good that it's made in the USA though."
2,Vocabulary Drill for Intermediate Speakers,"The set is useful as a vocabulary drill for intermediate speakers of English or Vietnamese (It can be used whether you are trying to Learn English or Vietnamese). However, because it is not organized alphabetically or by topic (words appear randomly)--this is its only use. It is not useful as a reference nor can it be adapted to lessons.The pauses are helpful for repeating words yourself, and the alternating Vietnamese-English, English-Vietnamese is helpful for really learning the words. However, the tracks on the cd are too large (about 4 per full CD), which makes it nearly impossible to learn words in small groups at a time."
2,Incorrect translation,"I'm a Vietnamese who teaches BASIC Vietnamese as a volunteer once a week.I found this album (level 1) on Napster. Since I figured I know most of the basic vocabulary, I listened to the Expressions part of the album and found that the translation is not completely correct.Besides a few incorrect translations that I heard, the Vietnamese (southern) lady often include the word ""ng"" meaning ""Mr."" as part of the translation. I hope no one that listened to it and used it because they'll be addressing everyone as Mr.I checked the other tracks to see if there are any errors. Yes, there are."
1,Fails to understand culture,"I bought Vocabulearn Vietnamese 2 and if the first book isn't different this company fails to understand Vietnamese culture and society. Most of the phrases in #2 are confrontative and the Vietnamese are not. If I used the phrases people would turn to me in digust. I have not used #1, but buyer beware."
2,Earning your information,"Yes, there is good historical and anecdotal information on emerging markets here, but you only get it by suffering through an irritating barrage of mixed metaphors and strained folksiness. Being personally familiar with some of the markets and happenings described, I found the actual information to be accurate enough, its just too bad there are a minimum of two cliches in every sentence."
4,Insightful!,"Mark Mobius wrote this emerging markets investment bible for major players in the financial industry. Fortunately, he used language that a novice investor can understand. While some of his more than 80 ""Mobius rules"" for investing may seem simplistic and clichéd, Mobius backs up his snappy, one-sentence rules with coherent instructions. The book has a friendly, conversational tone. His adventures visiting less-developed countries where he wants to invest are richly detailed. They offer a real glimpse into how business is conducted in markets such as Russia, Brazil, and Hong Kong. While the book's focus is toward investors with the means to travel, it shows how even small investors can capitalize on emerging markets. We [...] recommend this book to anyone in the stock market - particularly those who want to invest in emerging markets, but have no idea where to begin."
3,Not For Christian Organizations,"The music within the book is well done, just limited to personal use only!Most musicians purchasing Christian music sheets are doing so to share the music publically, and legally, with CCLI (church copyright) licenses. However, this company has chosen to block usage for CCLI license holders. This is their choice but, they should fairly advertise these song sheets as for personal use only...not for church copyright license holders and not to be used to share the gospel. Shame on you Hal Lindon Corp. for preventing people who legally purchase music, song sheets, and copyright licenses (to support the industry) from utilizing Christian music to share the gospel as was the intent of the songwriters, musicians, and the Lord's design for music."
1,Why did Amazon suddenly pull out this book?,"I have been waiting for the release of this book and ordered it in advance, only to be notified by Amazon that it will never be released (no further explanation was given). Well this book has in fact been released by Mr. Whitburn on his website, so how come Amazon is not able to sell it? Is it because Amazon is selling it at a discount price while Mr. Whitburn sells it at full price on his website? I am deeply disappointed that this has happened. Hopefully Mr. Whitburn will change his mind and release it to Amazon."
3,Made...but slightly rare,"After the arresting urgency of Highway Blues, this obscure entry goes down the road and around the bend for me. Perhaps the album will come to me in time, as Stormcock and Work of Heart certainly have. But Lifemask seems far more pensive and verbose than either. I'm still looking for a video of the movie from which some of this music comes, and perhaps Lifemask will harden on me at that time. Valentine, from around the same period, would be a better purchase for most."
3,These are not the original Love's lemon and baby soft,"The original Love's fresh lemon and Love's baby soft was produced by CHATTEM. This company MEM bought the name only, and I don't think the chemical makeup is the same (but of course, who actually remembers the exact LfL scent). Thats why these don't seem the same as the original Love's.If you want the original Chattem Love's Fresh Lemon they are sometimes for sale on ebay for about $40. But even then I would be skeptical to spend that money since the original was stopped production in the early 80s, so those are 20+ yrs old... can't be the same?Anyway if you buy this, fine but its not the real thing."
1,Barbara,"I purchased this product from another seller. I had been looking for this fragrance that was from the 1960's made by ""Love Cosmetics"". They had such a fresh line of fragrances, and their's smelled like fresh lemons and was so refreshing. When I received it I opened the bottle. All I could smell was cleaning solution. It was gross! This was not the fragrance I remembered. This smelled more like a disinfecting solution you would find in the cleaning aisle at the grocery store. I was very disappointed. I do not recommend this for anyone who likes the smell of lemons, unless you want to smell like cleaning products."
1,Save your money...Not what you remembered!!!!!!,"I usually don't leave reviews, but this was such a waste of money, not to mention a big disappointment. I should have known from the reviews I read that said this wasn't what we remembered, but I chose to believe the 'good' reviews. I sure don't know what they recieved to have given such glowing reviews, but, this product is in a 'tiny' plastic bottle & the contents smell as 'old as the hills'. Yuck! There is nothing fresh or reminicent about it! I truly feel 'ripped off'!"
2,Not very fresh and not very lemon,"I'm not sure what compelled me to buy this stuff; probably that I adore lemon as a lotion/perfume scent and so wanted to check it out. But I wasn't a fan. It wasn't awful, but it smelled noticeably old, slightly moldy. Somehow I doubt that Love's is still manufacturing this scent new anymore, which makes me wonder if FragranceNet just has some stockpile inventory of old perfume sitting there. I ended up throwing about half of the perfume out when I just couldn't stand to wear it anymore.If you want real crisp lemon, try Avalon Organics lemon hand and body lotion."
1,Bad Stuff!,"I was sooooo disappointed when I received this cologne. I hadn't seen Love's Fresh Lemon since the 70's, and I'm afraid this stuff must have been sitting in a dusty warehouse since then. Instead of the fresh, tingly fragrance of fresh lemons, it smelled more like rancid rubbing alcohol. What a let down. Don't waste your money!"
1,Not what I remember,this was such a dissapointment...! I wanted the crisp clean Love's fresh lemon of the 70's not this.. It is a knock off or something.. don't waste your money like I did...
1,LOVE'S NOT SO FRESH LEMON PERFUME,"What a huge disappointment! I was thrilled to find this and couldn't wait for it to arrive. I had hoped that it was the same as the fun scent that I wore in Jr. High School many years ago. Not only was it not, I couldn't wash it off my arms fast enough. It was absolutely horrible...smelled spoiled to say the least. Perhaps I just got a bad bottle. I guess my first clue was that it didn't come in a box, it wasn't sealed in any way, and the bottle was worn out. Oh well, I guess things are just best left in the old memory! Save your money and do not buy this pseudo product."
1,I'm scared to use it!,"I recently purchased a bottle of Love's Lemon. It smelled so strong until I am afraid to put it on my skin (a rash may form) or spray it on my clothes (may cause discoloration).It smells like sour lemonaide. This was a real disapointment because I have been searching for a fragrance that has a ""clean"" lemon smell.Buyer Beware."
1,disappointed,I was so disappointed in this product. I think it was left from the 70's. it didn't have a lemon scent at all. It stunk. Smelled rancid.
1,loves fresh lemon,When I saw the product on line I was very excited ... it is the perfume my wife of 32 years used when we first met. It is no longer available anywhere... so you can see why I was ready to buy it. When it came it was not the perfume I expected... in fact it does not even smell anmything like the product we knew so well. It is however packaged in the same containers.It was a special surprize gift for my wife on our 32 anniversary... when she opened the box it came in her eyes lit up. BUT... when she opened the container she was pretty must devastated to smell some thing that can only be described as really bad.
4,"nostalgic, in a good way","I adored this scent in high school, way back in the 70s, and still do. Fresh and fun and great for daily use. Wish the price were a bit lower."
1,MSG overload,"I went to put this in my ham and pea soup and thought to stop and read the ingredients. The SECOND ingredient is MSG, nasty. I threw out the entire box."
5,"the LUD is back, to tear some serious face","perhaps the single most influential band in hardcore in the last 10 years. if you dont have this, you might as well have nothing."
2,yuck,"Strongarm was bad enough, why do they need a rip-off band? They give us more of the melodic hardcore crap that is plaguing the scene. This cd was not necessary. If i want to listen to Strongarm, then ill listen to Strongarm, or shoot myself first."
5,Read on,"I use this mic with a home recording studio ran through my pc. In hindsight, a condenser mic would have been better, as dynamic mics are better suited for live performances, but it does the trick and as long as you know how to adjust mic levels in Windows it's not an issue. It does record a bit on the low side even with the mic recording level turned completely up, though, but this isn't bad as I sing quietly, so it's my own fault. Would recommend with 5 stars."
5,So far so good,Using with a Mackie system and it sounds very professional. Hoping that they will last for some time now. Great.
5,Awesome mic,What a great sounding microphone for such an affordable price. Bought for my 8 year old's 9th birthday. She plays drums and sings and needed something to amplify her voice so she can hear herself over the drums. Sounds awesome. Rich tone. She LOVES it and the cool case it comes in. Great purchase.
5,Outstanding,"I am a professional touring and recording artist, OMEB, who typically sings through a beta 58. I have recently been very impressed with some of Behringer's products. Sometimes I will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics. I had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one. At $25 I figured I could chance it! I used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show. The mic was much hotter than the 58, better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies! As far as durability... that is the question, but if you are looking for a great mic that doesn't cost $160 bucks... this is your mic!"
2,very good microphone BUT .....,"I ordered two of them and both arrived within a week. I tested both of them, they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said (that's why I bought this !!!). And they are solidly built too, not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine.I don't expect to come with it, so no cable is OK for me.Here is the BUT ...... : there is no ON/OFF switch, this really pissed me off.But this is my fault, I should have read the 1 star review first.The photo shows no ON/OFF switch, however this does not catch any attention.And all seller seems to have trouble to say ""this product does not have this, does not have that..."" It only says what the product does have.Oh well, I got stuck with two microphones without ON/OFF switch.I can buy an adapter with on/off switch for microphone."
1,DOA,"I ordered this mic based on all the reviews that said it was equilivant to the SM58. When I connected it to my PA amp all I got was popping noises and handeling noise. No voice at all. On top of that, the included clips mounting threads are too small for my On Stage mic stand. Am returning it and will buy a real Shure mic to replace it.Update I have since purchased the Samson Q7. Much better mic. This one really is as good as the SM58."
1,Disappointing,I was really disappointed that a cord to connect to the karaoke machine did not come with the microphone. I never imagined that a cord to connect to SOMETHING would not be included. Very misleading info on the website.
2,Fair mic for the price,"I used the XM8500 only a few times before deciding to find a better mic. This mic has excellent noise reduction qualities, but lacks the warmth and clarity that I was looking for. I wound up purchasing the Audix OM-6 and would recommend it to anyone."
4,It does the job it is designed for.,This is a good quality lower end mic. I bought for at home practicing and it does a good job. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.
5,a really good mic!,"I hold student concerts, as opposed to ""recitals"" (lol), every spring, in which we tell the audience a little about the music, give every performer a nice introduction, and have a large number of vocal performances ... good mics are an absolute necessity ... Having years of experience using Shures, EVs AKGs, it's nice to see that this mic gives them all, especially the ""industry standard"" SM58, a run for the money. I've had mixed experiences with Behringer gear. But this mic is a winner - it's solidly built, has a really clear sound, plenty of output, and an unbeatable price ..."
3,Cute pot for what??,"I've had this a long time, still don't know what its best use would be. I rarely use this one, too small for most anything, and too heavy to be a quick pick up. It's pretty!"
3,Little helps for staying present,"For someone whose mind rattles on and on most of the time, moving to the present moment and staying there is not as easy as Tolle suggests. My conflict seems to be that it's the mind that reads these little statements. Somehow those little snippets need to get transferred to my consciousness. So I use these short paragraphs as a ""settling down"" exercise before sitting quietly. Tolle's books have transformed my life for the better. I am learning to stay present and to enjoy every moment."
1,Danger Will Robinson--Danger,"I loved the Power of Now, but this book does not stand up to that book. Some of the passages are interesting, but for the most part this is a book that you could read at the book store for free. It is magazine material, not thought provoking book matter. I would have preferred to see most of this book on flash cards, instead of in its current form. I think Tolle has said it all and for me he said it all in his first book. Stillness is merely an echco."
1,It Speaks... But What Does It Say??,"What does stillness say in this little book? It says plase buy me. I know that I am overpriced and everything in me has been said before, but buy me anyway because my publisher needs the money. I loved the Power of Now, but this book was a waste of time. You can read the book in one sitting and your life will not change, except you will be lighter in the wallet."
1,Return To Sender,"What a disappointment this book was. I was expecting the Power of Now, but only got a dim bulb. Another reviewer is correct. This book should have been a paperback, instead of a costly hardcover. Most of the book is blank anyway. What a rip off!"
1,A Real Let Down,I would have much preferred to read this book in paperback. The value for the money in hardback just was not there. I mean 17 dollars for blank spaces is a lot to ask.
1,17 Dollar Hamburger,"For seventeen dollars I expected much, much more from this book. This was a waste of time and I felt while reading this little book that I was never getting my money's worth. For seventeen dollars I expected a full-course meal filled with insights and memorable thoughts, instead all I got was a bunch of chopped liver that was disposable. What was the author thinking when he sat down and wrote this silly volume that probably took him about 20 minutes to write. Seventeen dollars for this. Come on, give readers like me a break!!!"
1,Stillness Did Not Speak To Me,"This is a book that I regret reading. The material is nothing more than scraps from his first book The Power of Now. The ideas presented here are for the most part rather silly and off the wall. There is no order to the book. It's like Tolle just sat down at his kitchen table and began writing. Finally, there are more blank spaces that spaces filled with print, which makes this not really a book, but a book in the making. I hope that Tolle produces a true book in the future that his fans can appreciate, instead of little one like this, which was disappointing to say the least."
1,Poetic Justice,Roses are redViolets are blueIf you buy this bookYou will be in a spirtual stewThe volume is smallThe thinking blankFor this addition we have the publisher to thankThe Power of Now was greatAll the pages were fullBut for StillnessReaders get a lot of bullI am sorry I bought this bookI paid too much for the readI have to go nowBecause I have a family to feed.
4,Food for thought,"It was a bit of a rehash of his previous books. However, there are many passages that are good to ruminate over and apply to daliy living."
1,Pride and Ego,"Some of the reviews here, defending the book, are interesting.Some reviewers would have us believe that those who do not appreciate the book are somehow less than enlightened. Implying, of course, that these reviewers themselves ARE somehow enlightened, and therefore entitled to judge.And these comments often come from the same people who will fulminate about ""Don't trust your ego!!""Well, my friends, your ego has slipped in through the back door and bitten you on the behind. You are guilty of the old fashioned sin of pride!So, as always, the self-proclaimed ""enlightened"" ones have a lot more work to do. At least the people who dislike the book are honest about it.This book is a waste of time and money. Buy ""The Power of Now"" instead. It is a far superior book, with much the same content.The point is not to continuously buy books about these things. The point is to DO them!"
1,Book is a Contradiction,"If what Tolle says is true, then the method in which he is using to tell his story is a contradiction. In other words, if mind is really not where it is at, then to convey his message via the mind in this book would imply that the book is second rate. The author cant have it both ways. He can't say that the mind is bad and then use his mind to write a book. To use his mind to write a book would in itself discount his original proposition that the mind is the enemy."
1,What a Load of Donkey Poop,If anyone thinks that this book is really the book that should follow the Power of Now they have to be kidding themselves. Here we have an example of a rushed job that makes like of New Age ideas. Stop cashing in on Tolle and ask him to do another book that is worth reading--not this garbage!
5,Comfort in your own skin,"This book is great. When silence becomes our friend, then we know we are on purpose. I achieved this when I read Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self. Optimal Thinking showed me how to be my best and create my best life. I suggest you read both of these books if you want to make the most of every moment."
3,Okay Book,"This book is mediocre compared to The Power of Now and A New Earth. I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to Eckhart Tolle, but it's worth purchasing if you're already a huge fan and have read his other books. The reason I recommend a fan purchase it is because he restates many of the same truths from his two other books in slightly different form and language, which I find helpful for getting a fuller picture of what he's trying to say overall. Tolle states in his introduction that his goal was to write something along the lines of the ancient sutras of India, and I'd say he succeeds at this endeavor to some extent, but don't expect to be reading a modern incarnation of the Upanishads."
3,Degrading the asset he uses to communicate his message,"I was disappointed with this book. Sure, stillness transcends the mind and is pure consciousness, but a most powerful asset we all have is our mind. Thoughts are creative and parent our lives. When we devalue our mind, we devalue creation. I have been a meditator for years, and travel the spiritual path. I believe in enbracing and transcending the mind -- not devaluing it. I recommend Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self to optimize our role in the universe (find unity in diversity), to be our best, bring out the best in other people, make the most of every situation and maximize our emotional and spiritual lives."
4,Good Book!,"If you believe in meditation you'll like this book. It can assist you in tapping into quietness, stillness, so you can truly reach a place a peacefulness. I really enjoyed it. It was an easy read, not as difficult to follow as a few of the other books he's written."
1,What a Bummer,"I was so excited and was anxiously awaiting this book. When I opened it up I was sadly taken over by disappointment. It's a book of PHRASES. Did I miss something in the review? If so, that's my fault. However, if I'm ever feeling down or in need of a pick-me-up phrase, there's no need for me to pay $15 for it. Not discounting the fact that many of the phrases are well said, but I didn't need to buy a book of them! Just an easy way for the author to make some extra $$. BUUUUUUMMMMBBEEED"
4,the very essence of Now...,"If you haven't readThe Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment, start there. But then? Pick upStillness Speaks. Have it with you. Keep it near. It is the boiled down essence. The core of the teachings. Tiny little pieces of enormous wisdom."
5,Excellent book,"This book does what a book on spirituality should do by pointing the way toward higher living without dragging in belief systems and dogma.It opens the door to a new way of living.I found it a much more and enjoyable and informative read than ""The Power of Now"" by virtue of it's simplicity."
3,Stillness,"Stillness spaeks only when one is concentrating on it. It is an interesting book, helps to relax. Short reading. Put somewhere where you can pick up once a awhile and read a couple of pages."
2,Interesting but vague,"When reading Stillness Speaks, I found that Tolle discusses abstract concepts such as 'the Now' and 'the One Life', but doesn't write much about how his ideas apply to regular peoples' everyday lives. While his writing style is exquisite and the book is pleasurable to read, the actual content is vague and unrealistic. I recently experienced the death of a loved one and got the impression that Tolle is a religious/spiritual scholar, but has never suffered hardship. His writing is very pretty, but the book is not especially meaningful or useful."
4,"focusing on the ""here & now","Reading this book has helped me to stay focused on what is real: ""the here & now: I highly recommend it."
5,Bite-size bits of wisdom from one of the great authors.,Eckhart Tolle has been a favorite of mine since I read 'The Power of Now' years ago. 'Stillness Speaks' is full of bite-sized bits of wisdom from this great author. Check him out on YouTube. He has a very engaging and genuine way of speaking his truth.
1,A Shameful Addition,This is the book that follows The Power of Now? The publisher must be kidding. What a shame. There is nothing here but a void. Darkness overshawdows this book and I as a reader was let down by the author's myopic views that lack real insight.
1,Silliness Speaks,"This is the worst I've seen from Tolle yet. Nothing more than a collection of tautologies and scribbles from a man with way too much time on his hands. In fact, I am quite certain this work was plagiarized from a collection of fortune cookies stolen from a cheap chinese buffet.RM"
5,"not just for children,but for sharkies!","This film is very well done and shows wonderful footage of Rodney Fox being attacked by a giant Great White shark! It also shows footage of sharks tearing up cages of solid metal,well,not really solid. Adults should not watch this before going spearfishing,of course. Children should not sit through this when the next day is snorkeling time,but otherwise,this is for everyone in this land. And certainly,this is a shark documentary that National Geographic should be proud of!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I hate saying this but most of my students fell asleep during the showing of this movie. They (Those few that did stay up)also did not like the subliminal guilt trip. If you are planning on using it in a classroom, I think you might want to rethink that thought.But then I could be wrong."
3,Almost Back Ms. Palmer,"I had given Diana Palmer's last book, Paper Rose, one star because I felt it was the same old story line again, nothing new or fresh. This book is pretty much the same as the others, older man with issues, a younger woman with issues and they don't get along. But, I feel this book shows glimpes of the old Diana Palmer where the books made you feel something and might have choked you up. She didn't turn Matt Caldwell into a heartless or mean person or Leslie into a spineless wimp. Matt actually had a heart and Leslie some spirit. I am beginning to see the Diana Palmer whose books I couldn't put down."
3,Along the same line.,"Interesting read, but has the usual storyline of abused frightened girl who can't stand the touch of men, being able to let the main character leap on her."
1,Got a stiff drink ?,"Well you'll wish you had one handy while reading this book. Diana Palmer is a decent writer despite the fact that all her heroes and heroines are basically the same. The book started off good but slowly went downhill. The heroine and hero both have troubled pasts that separately would be terribly tragic but together, arghh. It's enough to drive you crazy. Not since Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley have two people been so wrong for each other. The male lead is a times viciously cruel(though not physically) and then seems to be a freakin saint. The heroine ranges from proud and spirited to unbelievably meek and mild. This book was so horrible and cliched and the charaters should be screened for schizophrenia. Don't let this review discourage you from her other books, just this one."
2,Typical D. Palmer,"If you like Diana Palmer, you will like this. Nothing special, just the same stuff she usually writes. A nice quick read."
4,Matt,"A good book. It is a lot like the other books she writes. It starts out with Matt being a selfish, insensitive and rude man but by the end of the book you love him. I enjoyed it."
1,Absolute garbage,What a waste of paper. A wimp and a bully -- two less likable characters would be hard to find.
1,the end--the cars sell out,"there is no resemblance to the band that put out two masterpieces in their debut and 'candy o'. 'shake it up' was the beginning of the end, but still had a few decent tracks on it. (cruiser, since you're gone). this is most certainly the end. if you like drum machines and synthesizers over good rock and roll, buy this one. if not, buy the first two.gets one star for drive, a cheesy song, but great vocals by benjamin orr. r.i.p."
2,Geeky fluff,"It appears that The Cars let commercial factors drive the substance of this album, user-friendly musical pablum -- instantly familiar, mostly forgettable. As so often happens, this kind of sell-out was one step away from the end of the group. And what a shame, after their remarkable first three albums. I do like ""Stranger Eyes"", which is more like the material on the earlier CD's."
3,I remember I could not wait for this record...,"I remember how I could not wait for this record to come out, and if I remember right it had a delay or two. The day it hit the stores I bought it and as soon as I got in the car I played it...and I did not really like it from the get go. ""Magic"" annoyed me right off the bat. Over time I have grown to like it enought to give it 3 stars, but then again I never listen to it anymore. Around '86 to '87 music was changing, metal was in (yick), the Police were going out, and I could tell the Cars were on the way out also(I promise this it not hindsight, I thought the record was garbage and the end was near at the time). I am still shocked about how big this record was and how much play the videos got. Maybe it is just me, but I just do not like this record."
2,Failed Expectations,"It was with great anticipation that I bought Heartbeat City back in 1984, and, though I was somewhat pleased with the commercial recognition the band received, I vowed then that it was the last album of theirs that I would buy. I never bothered to purchase their follow-up to Heartbeat City.Too commercial. Too Pop. The Cars lost whatever ""edge"" they had with this album, though Shake It Up was a premonition in this regard as the group moved toward the mainstream. They were neither smart nor funny anymore....and became another MTV-friendly pop act.Some of the songs are catchy, but the overall effect is flat. Ocasek's love of the studio is ever-present, and the album probably would have been improved if he'd actually allowed all the group's members to play during its recording.I label Heartbeat City as a letdown for fans of The Cars from their beginnings, though I'm sure the 12 year olds back in '84 loved it."
2,pop filler,"This is not even close to the best album by The Cars, but it had all the pop radio hits like ""Drive"" ""You might think"", and ""Magic"". I don't like the soft rock pop of the Cars but prefer their earlier albums like the debut and Candy-O. The Cars are one of the greatest New Wave bands of all time but they slipped in my opinion from 1984 and on. Do yourself a favor and buy their first three albums to hear musical genius."
2,"Great album, but the new gold CD release has problems","I love this album, and wanted to buy the new gold version as soon as it came out. This is, indeed, the best sounding version of this album. Congratulations are in order. Nevertheless, the new Audio Fidelity release has a couple of problems. It doesn't have the segues of the original album, and even though it's encoded in HDCD, sometimes the encoding disappears without warning and you are left with a click (depending on your player). The artwork is horrendous. When you pay $25 or so for an ""audiophile"" release, you have to expect perfection everywhere. This release is simply not up to par with the offerings of companies like Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs."
3,Not the same Cars I like,"Lots of people say that this is the best Cars album, but they probably only like it because it was the only one publicized enough to make them want to go out and buy it.""Panorama"" is the last good album that The Cars put out, then they started to get a top 40 sound, they weren't themselves when they released their last few albums, it seemed like they just wanted to make money.Pick up the 2 best albums by the Cars instead, ""The Cars (self titled)"" because it has some amazing songs, and the band is nice and fresh, and ""Panorama"" because it's really experimental, giving the album some elements you can't hear on the other ones, which I really like."
4,Heartbeat City,The Cars walked away at the top of their creativity with this innovative album.The synergy of the Cars at this point in time was at a unique rock pinnacle.. Ben Orr always missed and Ric Ocasek forever idolized.
4,Slick But Likeable,"Another installment in the Cars saga, and as enjoyable as the rest. This album seems a bit slicker than the rest of their oeuvre, which at least paid off commercially. A few songs (as always) suffer from clumsly lyrics (I'm thinking ""I Refuse""), but it's still an entertaining run start to finish. My favorites include ""Hello Again"", ""Why Can't I Have You"" and ""Drive"", with the title track making an intriguing finale."
3,"Can you say ""sell out"" and ""commercial""?","It's not that ""Heartbeat City"" is a bad album - it's really quit...ummm perfect. Too perfect in fact. It sounds like a computer did most of the work here - and while that's okay for Devo and Tangerine Dream, this is THE CARS after all.There's no heart in this album - anywhere. While it is full of singles (I think there was 5 from this album) not one of them will have any lasting value in 10-15 years.""Heartbeat City"" might be the best song on here and that's not saying much - although ""Drive"" isn't such a bad song - it just doesn't sound like The Cars."
1,"Egomaniac engineer hijacks The Cars ""Heartbeat City""","This ""audiophile"" gold CD is ruined by the ""mastering engineer"" Steve Hoffman's decision to ignore the original pacing,presention and intent by the band and producer Mutt Lange by adding unnecessary gaps between the songs.On the original LP,tape and CD,the songs flowed without interruption.Secondly,the HDCD(means ""high-definition CD"")encoding causes audible popping and clicking sounds at the end of each song.And lastly,the sound isn't even that much improved over the old 1980's CD which you can buy for only $6.99-7.99 at most retail outlets.Don't waste your money on this bastardaztion of an 1980's rock classic,which get 5 stars in its original CD form."
4,Another great album for the Cars,"1984's Heartbeat City is the Cars most commercially successful album. Featuring the hits ""Hello Again"", ""You Might Think"", ""Drive"", ""Heartbeat City"", and ""Magic"" is one of the Cars finest albums, second only to their debut album. To bad the Cars only lasted for one more album after this one."
4,You can see it all!,"Fabulous really. The lighting is outstanding. I am very picky about vanity mirrors and this one fits the bill. I searched forever and finally came back to this one- which was my first choice anyway.You have to get up close though- b/c of the magnification it blurs if your face isn't close enough. I think all magnification mirrors are this way. Anyway my makeup looks so precise using this mirror.I love it!Update: October, 2011. It's five years later since purchase. Haven't had a single issue with it. No bulb change, nothing. It's easy to clean and just as bright as it was five years ago."
4,Super Bright,"If you are looking for the brightest magnifying mirror, this could be it. The clarity of the mirror is excellent and the magnification is just the right amount for ""up close"" work. The only thing I would change is instead of the fixed ""s"" neck, make the neck flexible. The mirror part swivels up and down for angle adjustment.The first one arrived with broken glass but as usual Amazon quickly handled that and shipped a replacement which was fine."
4,my second mirror,"After three years of consistent use, my first Zadro mirror must be replaced. The on/off switch got stuck and no longer functions. I searched for different mirrors but opted to purchase the same mirror again. Its track record is far better than previously owned mirrors (some less expensive, some more). I would recommend that more care be given to pressing the on/off switch, being careful not to use it more than necessary, and using a lighter touch when depressing the switch."
1,X-Mas Gift Arrived Broken - Poorly Packaged,"We paid for next day shipping to get this as a Christmas gift for my mom. It came broken, 2 days late, and was not wrapped in any bubble wrap, or anything, just placed in it's cardboard frame, so it could easily move and slam around in box. You would think that for a $100 mirror they would take the time to wrap it nice and securely. Very frustrating!"
2,Just Okay,"It bought this mirror because my new place didn't have natural light in the bathroom and I thought it would be bright enough based on reviews. While it has some brightness, I don't think the one sided magnification and amount of light are enough to warrant the price. It's just okay. I think there are others out there just as good for less money."
1,New Today,"Well, I received this mirror for Christmas today, and it does not work. So disappointing. Will be returning it tomorrow."
2,Vanity Mirror doesn't meet my needs.,"Zadro S-Neck Surround Light Vanity MirrorI stand (not seated), while applying my make-up. Mirror must sit on bathroom counter. Mirror does not have telescoping neck to raise it to height I need.Mrs. J. Blandford"
3,My 500th review,"This is the Beau Brummels second album, as should be obvious from the title. Unlike their first album, this one doesn't contain any big hit songs that most people will remember. So, it's got that going against it. However, the songs that are here are pretty good for the most part. Also, the songs were all written by members of the group, which was unusual at the time. The CD contains two bonus tracks. ""Woman"" is a vocal version of a song that appeared as an instrumental on the original album. And ""When It Comes to Your Love"" is an instrumental version of a song that featured vocals on the original album. This last bonus track was heard in the filmVillage of the Giants."
4,MAD MAN. MADDENING DIRECTOR. GOOD READ.,"Kazan may well have been one of Hollywood's most hated men --- in 1952, he ""named names"" of peers and pals that were Communists during McCarthy's maniacal manhunt, something for which almost no one forgave him; so strong was Hollywood's hatred that when Kazan was chosen, in 1999, to receive an Honorary Oscar, he was publicly condemned as a traitor. But there's no arguing that Kazan was also a damn good director. (Think On the Waterfront, Gentleman's Agreement, A Face in the Crowd.) Noted film scholar Richard Schickel has penned a frank, unflinching biography, as smart as it is shrewd. Schickel's decision to put Kazan's decried decision into the context of its time and the director's life illuminates the personalities and preoccupations of the man who reshaped the way we look at theater and film."
4,Too Partisan,"Schickel is one of the few film critics of any authenticity; he certainly has credentials, having written about film for Time magazine, having directed, produced, and written screenplays. He writes knowledgably about the controversial Kazan, but is perhaps a bit too partisan to his politics. It's good to explore that area of controversy, but Kazan seems to be much too determined to exculpate Kazan during the HUAC hearings. Still, anyting Schickel writes is worth reading, and arguing about."
5,Alan Moore proves once again the importance of a good diet,Alan Moore rights very good poety. He the best rider in the world. Watchmen rule!
5,Safe Choice,"This product has done well for me. Bought 2 Memory Chips and both have been under consistant work for over a month. So far, no probs."
4,Great when it works,"When I installed the RAM chip it improved the performance of the computer. However, I should have been able to install two RAM modules. The second one didn't work properly. I exchanged it for another one and that one didn't work either. When they work, they work great."
2,Background music,"I've been listening to French music for years and try to actively follow the scene. For me, the music in the ""Le Pop"" series just fades into the background - it all has the current morose low-energy French sound, for the most part. I'd recommend sticking to albums by individual artists so you can become familiar with an artist."
5,Great Pen!,I love writing with this oversized pen! I can write faster and my hands don't hurt anymore!I will buy some more very soon!
4,"Nice, warm, diverse","Versatile, warm and soulful trumpet of Marcus Printup is really a nice feature of contemporary jazz. For instance, I've seen and heard him on Jazz at Lincoln Center recordings - he has a nice role there as well....Personally, I actually enjoyed his album ""Unveiled"" more than this one (this is the second Printup album I bought); ""Unveiled"" seemed more stylistically coherent, although there was a lot of various stylistic features there as well... Maybe I miss the great tenor sax of Stephen Riley from that album? Still, this is a very good CD, with a nice mixture of jazz standards - freshly interpreted - and original compositions.I'm looking forward to hearing other Printup albums."
3,Not good enough to buy,The first track is the best but after that it gets bad. The piano player Kevin Bales playes much better than Printup. Printup sounds like a typical college freshman. He uses many turns and use-less grace notes at the the beginning of lines. I dont think he one of the up and coming trumptist like many have said.
1,"""porcelain enamel surface"" - NOT","The features part of the item description says:- Food will not react with porcelain enamel surfaceUnfortunately, this wok is 100% cast iron just like the pans my dad took camping to fry fish. There isn't a speck of porcelain on it and the porcelain coating is what's supposed to make Le Creuset stuff so good. Uncoated cast iron is hard to clean and it's just a matter of time before it rusts so back it goes to Amazon.I've asked them to fix the incorrect description but so far, they have not bothered to do so."
1,"Cool look factor aside, this wok does not cook well","I bought this wok to match my Le Crueset dutch ovens and casseroles. I can say from experience, do not buy this wok. I'm amazed such a fine company as Le Crueset would market this item. Save yourself a lot of money and buy a Joyce Chen or some other brand carbon steel wok for a 5th the cost. Cast iron is a wonderful metal to cook with in the oven and for select projects on the stove-top, but not for stir fry and not at this price."
4,great people to buy from,"I bought these candlesticks for my brother and sister, and I was a little disappointed at first. The company contacted me and worked with me about it. I just want to let everyone know this is a really great company to buy from, and I really appreciate all they have done for me."
4,Treasure Worth Its Weight In Gold,"Not a happy listen by most standards. Erratically Spanish- and Mexican-flavored, tuneful, rhythmically masculine, and often foreboding, this would scarcely be a first pick for reconstruction and re-recording, but reconstructed and re-recorded it is. Commendable just the same. Massive (a touch overblown?) in scope, the score contains numerous moments that display the composer's dramatic gift for evocative themes and orchestrations. It is not a classic as defined by other Steiner scores like ""Band of Angels"", ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Rome Adventure"" or ""They Died With Their Boots On"", but it is in the upper tier. Album production and performances by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra & Chorus are stellar; includes trailer music, and alternate main title and finale cues."
5,A must have for Max Steiner fans...,or anyone for that matter!a great companion to the greatest movie of all time!
5,One of their best !,"GE's best album since Moontan. Bloody Buccaneers rounds out all of what they are in one modern album. A lot of people think they are trying to copy other groups but what most do not realize, A lot of group surely were listing to them, Brian Adam's outright stole some of George's riffs. Fleetwood Mac took Caesar's drum setup. This is one of their most successful albums in Europe. Sony was just plain stupid not to promote and release this in the US at the time. Aerosmith ask them to tour with them that year but GE turned them down because to the success of this album in Europe. I saw this group in the seventies play with Aerosmith then with Foghat and they blew both of them off the stage. Then again in the 80's with Rush and people were screaming for Rush to get off and bring Earring back out !Golden Earring celebrated their 47th anniversary in 2008 and have been performing almost continuously since their foundation in 1961."
4,Great for clean bottoms,"I have these Neat seat potty toppers, the Summer Infant keep me clean and the Potty Cover, disposable seat cover. Of all three, this is my 2nd favorite. They are better than the Summer Infant Keep me Clean as they provide sticky tabs at three angles which seems to be better for sealing to the toilet seat. The price of these definately bet teh Potty Cover brand, but the Potty Cover seat covers provide ULTIMATE cover, they also seem to stay in place without any sticky tabs. Nevertheless, I will alternate between these and the Potty Cover brand. For areas where you dare too have to use the bathroom, you can't go wrong with the Potty Cover, but for everyday use and areas where you just desire toilet seat protection, these will suffice."
4,Love them!!!!,I absolutely love the potty seat covers. My 2 1/2 year old will not go potty at public restrooms unless we have potty seat covers. Unfortunately I ran out of them at a time when all the Target stores in my area were sold out. I ordered the 40-count from Amazon and they came right away.
2,Not enough protection for hands!,"If your little one grabs onto the sides of the potty chair like mine does, then this seat cover DOES NOT offer enough protection. Continue searching for the ones that actually drape over the sides of the seat. They are worth the extra money! I gave these Dora seat covers away to my friends who don't use any seat covers for their little ones, and they love them. But for me (ultra cautious about public restrooms), they were not good enough. They need to be designed to drape over the chair."
5,Works very well,"These work just as they say. The stay in place and the design tends to help distract my toddler son from the fact that it's the ""big potty"". Also, they fit all size toilets - the smaller one in family bathrooms and the regular size ones. Excellent product!"
5,Best Things Ever !,"I bought these because every time I took my two year old daughter to the potty ,the seat cover holders were always empty. They stick really well to the seat and are big enough to cover the potty so she is not touching it . I can also take advantage and use them myself."
1,sticky tape tabs DONT WORK,"Well, first of all... I have used these for years and loved them.. BUT the last order of over 100 of them has been defective!When you pull off the MUCH NEEDED pink sticky cover tabs... the sticky label ALSO COMES OFF!!! which is quite inconvenient since the topper is very slippery on the bottom.. I am hoping to contact the company directly for this defect... and it was not just one package.. i tried a topper out of each one that i bought. ALL WERE DEFECTIVE! great product when they work properly!"
3,Not my favorite,This is my second different purchase of potty covers. I have to say by reading the reviews I thought that these would be big enough to cover the toilet and have enough overhang for my daughter to hold on to the toilet but they are not. Next time I need to order I will go with the Summer Infant again.
3,"Can't relate to those found this book ""positive"".","While a reader who left a bad review on Amazon attacked the author as a ""disgruntled employee"" as the basis for his poor review, my opinion expresses my not being able to find a ""gift"" in all of the reading. To me I found this book upsetting, not at the author, more at the content. I take the book with a ""grain of salt"" because I am not solid in my stance about channelling, but if in fact the author's ""readings"" on JonBenet are in fact true it hurts to read that her life was such a rotten one. JonBenet is called a very vulgar name by her own mother who also contends that she is a bad person who will go to hell. While the book offers yet another take on this tragedy, I can't see the ""gift"" of it."
1,Worst Book Yet on the JonBenet Case,"You don't even have to read between the lines to see this is a disgruntled failure who saw a chance for some attention. By her own admission, even before working for Access, she had trouble finding and holding a job. Forget about her nonsensical, delusional channeling, she can't even get the known facts of the case straight. Clearly the drugs and alcohol she says she consumed so copiously have left some permanent damage. Don't waste your money on this crazy lady."
1,An Opportunist,"Jane Stobie represents the worst that crawls out of the woodwork whenever a tragedy occurs.She self published this repulsive trash hoping to cash in on her connection to JonBenet, as a former employee of John Ramsey.Anyone who ever knew her knows of her hatred and jealousy of the family.If JonBenet could speak from her grave ,she would certainly find something less inane to say than what's in this book.This ""Suddenly Psychic Susan"" needs to get a real job."
1,Vicious and Cruel,"No one could stop Jane or anyone else from accusing the Ramseys, for telling negative stories - - not even if they believed they were vicious LIES. But time has helped bring out the truth.The investigation never found evidence of the ramseys neglecting or abusing any of their children and the latest news we have had was that of an arrest of an INTRUDER suspect.He was cleared when his DNA didn't match that the killer left behind. The unsourced DNA that didn't come from Karr or JonBenet's parents.I have written a play - ""Murdering JonBenet"". It is available on Ebay. If people want to know the truth, they might want to see what I have to say. It does not name the killer, but it tells a lot of truth Jane chose to ignore."
5,Perfect for aspiring artists and fashion lovers,"This beautiful book was purchased for my grandmother for Christmas and was her favorite gift! It's big and heavy for a paper back so it makes a great coffee table book. My grandmother takes art classes and has always loved fashion, so this was a perfect book for her combination of interests."
3,"Good Grammar, Poorly Edited - Not For Self Study","Baugh's grammar is good, but this must be the worst edited book I've ever seen. His editor should have lost his job after this was published. My Greek professor was always correcting errors, including incorrect breathing marks, wrong articles, wrong endings, wrong answers in the back of the book, and even problems with English grammar. The answers for translation exercises follow some Bible translation rather than following the glosses provided by Baugh, which means the answers are often different than what you will get even if you correctly translate the sentences based on the information you've been provided. While he provides a list of words not yet learned for all his translation exercises, he often leaves words out! THIS BOOK SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR SELF STUDY! You will need someone to guide you through all of the poor editing mistakes."
4,Useful but not perfect,"I have used this book both in my own learning and in teaching NT greek. I found it helpful and useful in avoiding many issues that are not central to learning the language (one thinks fo the two or three chapters in Machen's book dedicated to accents). Baugh's division of chapters as well as his organization of vocabulary is well thought out and a benefit to those who might easily become overwhelmed by language study. The most problematic issue with the book falls in the translation practice. All of the practice examples are bible verses (a common thread in most Greek primers) which creates issues on two fronts: 1) Well known verses do not require you to know Greek to translate them, and 2) There are many practice examples in which vocabulary is used which the student has not yet learned and some which is not present even in the glossary at the end of the book. All of that being said I still recommend this book and will continue to use it in the future."
5,"The ""new"" marketing takes on an intriguing face.","Doug Atkin reveals what ""cultism"" really is (not funny Kool-aid for the mind-numbed) and why we should aspire to having our customers ""cult our brand.""He points out the massive changes which have taken place since the Attraction Principle replaced a lot of Spot TV, and helps us evaluate lower-cost options which get big results.The point of view is valuable and well-presented, the supporting evidence and other argumants are equally well-handled.If you have customers, and are anything from a sole propriator on up, this book is challenging and valuable."
2,Meh...,"This book is out of print. I don't even recall where I heard about it. As a whole it's an interesting look at brand loyalty. Saturn, Nike, Harley -- they have cult followings that rival few others. It was interesting to read the interviews with Marines and religious cult members to see how similar the sentiments are from faith to brand loyalty. But, I didn't get much of an education from it on building cult status for a brand. If you can find it, maybe it's worth the read. But don't go out of your way for it."
1,Culting of Brands......Two years too late.,"As Graduate Marketing student I had to do research on this topic, the concepts in this book are solid, but it was published two years after The Power of Cult Branding. Which happens to say everything this author is trying to say, except The Power of Cult Branding was published by Random House two years earlier. After reading both books it is obvious that The Culting of Brands is just a copy of the original. This is why I gave it such low review. Also The Power of Cult Branding gives nine well-researched case studies and the logic behind the marketing plans of these true Cult Brands. Mr. Atkins book offers nothing that was not already written.I think is funny that Mr. Atkins only changed the name from The Power of Cult Branding to The Culting of Brands. My Professors would failed me for plagiarism."
2,Quelle Disappointing!,"Having read NY Noir I waited for this one with bated breath. I could have unbated by breath, I was mightily disappointed. The photos were average at best, some were even white-outs. I can't imagine why those would even be included. The captions/ descriptions were placed on the page before each set of pictures and I found it very bothersome to have to flip back and forth.If only the subject matter had been a bit more compelling...oh I don't know why, but the book just did not move me. It took me about 15 minutes to read the entire book. If you are really interested in true crime/photography, any book by Weege or New York Noir are two I highly recommend. Save your money on this one and look at it in the library."
5,best ADD book for teens and parents of ADD teens,"I have read many books on ADD (I have it, both kids have it). This is by far the best book for teens to read to understand their ADD and how it affects their lives. PArents should read, too. Helps to understand what kids are going thru. Started out as library book, and then bought this copy. Make sure you give your teen a pack of post-it notes as they read thru to mark passages. Recommended to teens, parents and any psychologist who claims to understand ADD."
1,part not as described or pictured,"This part was not at all like it was described, attempts to return seem to be failing as well. Very dissatisfied!"
5,A Must Have!,"Friends, you simply *must* have this workbook if you've ordered Father Luke's ""A Catholic Guide To The Bible"" book. Not only will you be able to test yourself on what you've learned, it is very useful as a study aid in or out of the classroom!"
4,Useful Worklight,"I purchased this lamp about a year ago, and it's reasonable decent: a year outside and it has withstood the elements, etc., and provides good light at the grill area. The only precaution is that it gets quite hot while operating, and as I haven't used it for extended periods of time, I can't say if that causes trouble, but I rather suspect that if operated for an extended period, the heat may deteriorate the PVC sleeving around the end.Update: after a couple of years, I'd have to remove a couple of stars from the rating. The vinyl tubing around the flexible neck is not weather-proof, and deteriorated rapidly. The unit began leaking water and rusting, so I had to re-wrap it with vinyl tape to prevent electrical hazards."
3,Low quality. Must be covered,"This is a nice lamp, and good value for the money. However, it will not stand up to the elements. After 1 year it started to rust, and the plastic on/off button got brittle and cracked off.If you keep it covered it should last much longer. For $40 I will buy a new one and take better care of it."
3,Designer's edge,"The Designer's Edge L856 from Amazon is a good light and has the flexibility to point the light wherever you need it. This is, however, the second one I've owned and had to replace the first one because the switch broke. The switch is covered with plastic and over time the integrity of the plastic deteriorates and then breaks. It seems there is no way to just replace the switch so I had to buy a new product. The old one lasted two years."
3,3 1/2 stars really. Good product but wears out.,"I built my own big green egg table and after about 30 hours of construction I wanted to add a light to the table. Ended up putting a power box in the corner that plugged in and was hard wired to this light. After spedning so much time designing and building the table I found this light which 2 years ago at least was the only hard wired outdoor grille light I could find. It has weathered ok. It still functions however the switch is beginning to stick and the flexible body is beginning to rust (it is encased in plastic). I would still recommend if you are looking for a hard wired outdoor grille light option. My plan is to replace whenever the top portion wears out and use wiring and holes that are in place. Overall it is a decent product as long as you realize like grille covers, griddles, and grilles themselves, it won't last forever."
2,The other reviewers are right,This item was for an outdoor BBQ island. I installed them myself and they work very well. It didn't take long and the plastic coating over the flexible neck cracked from the weather and they began to rust. Outdoor products should be more resilient in the weather. I used automotive flex coil to cover the neck and hide the corrosion. The lights still work at two years old.
3,So-so build quality,"It's OK. Almost one year to the date, the weatherproof boot that covers the switch deteriorated and that let moisture into the switch - which promptly failed. The clear plastic covering over the flexible gooseneck has now cracked and flaked off. Seems kind of odd, because now water can get into the fixture and run down into the junction box - and this is a 120 volt fixture so it could hurt. I ended up plugging the hole for the switch in the base and running a switch in a bell type weatherproof box with cover. Still - it is plenty bright and for what the top of the line fixture costs, you can buy 5 or 6 of these, so get this one and a spare when you order!"
4,Weather Station,It's nice that this item still exists. It was a gift for an elderly realtive who loved it.
5,Canon Sure shot 150u automatic compact 35mm film camersa,Very pleased... Have had several Canon SureShot cameras and all have performed well. Would recommend this brand to others who are still using film!
1,Do not buy Canon 150u,"Viewfinder blocks the view. Faulty design. Do not buy this. Canon must stop making this camera. Recommendation to amazon to not carry it, as you will surely get customer returns"
5,Thankful for Part in Stock,"I feel so lucky that I was able to find this part for my 18-year old Kitchen-Aid Kitchen Center Mixer. It is my favorite wedding gift, and it broke my heart when I caught a spatula between the beaters and the coupling broke. Originally, I started searching for the entire mixer arm. While perusing Amazon, I was able to determine that this was the only part I needed. It fit perfectly and I'm back in business. Under $25 to fix the mixer sure beats $200+ for a replacement. While you can purchase this part outside of Amazon, I feel safer with products coming through Amazon."
4,You da mann!,"Not essential, but interesting if you are a Mann fan. Yes, the fidelity is not equal to the most modern recording techniques. But, hey, history is here,these are recordings from 1956-57. Half of the cd features the great big band-Latin jazz of the Machito orchestra. They were a great band, full of great big band jazz musicians, and Herbie is not ultra featured but Man o Mann these cats wail! The other half of the recording features the west coast cool jazz of Jimmy Rowles on piano, Mel Lewis on drums, Buddy Clark bass and Herbie playing duos with the terrific Buddy Collete and both play not only flute but clarinet and alto and tenor sax! Cool baby! Please note-research the sellers. You can find some selling this one for $3-5, so don't grab one selling at $20 or more. Also, check to make sure you get the cd that features all 20 tunes, some of these are bogus offerings of only 8-10 entrees. Solid!"
5,A standout !,"This is the one to have ! It's by far the most complete coverage of Star Office. I like the writing style - it's clear and focused. This book is rare because it does a good job of being both book to learn Star Office with, and also a good reference once you're a Star office veteran."
3,"Not bad, but forgot to run it through the spellcheck","This book has frustrated me more than twice. It has a bunch of typos, refers to commands and options that don't exist (on the Windows version anyway), and check out the index for those of you that have it. The first entry under 'O' is oatmeal on page 478. I wondered ""what could the word oatmeal be doing in this book?"" So I headed to page 478 and couldn't find it anywhere on the page! If someone can point it out to me, let me know.Other than those complaints, the book is okay. The topics kind of jump around not seeming to flow just right. I'm absolutely new to StarOffice and being a Microsoft Office user for the past 8 years it's helped me find the same features I'm used to in Office.Good for the beginner, but watch out for the errors in the text!"
5,wizard of string instruments,"you could put any kind of string instrument in david lindley's hands and he would be able to put out some kind of groove with it. his verstality shows in the different styles of music that he plays, and this cd contains different generes of music, and he plays them all well. dig it!"
4,Make sure you buy the power cord too,"thought this was all i needed to hook up my Garmin Fishfinder, but you have to buy the power cord too for another $20,"
4,A bolt out of the blue .............................,"This is a truly amazing recording considering Dan's previous output, and demonstrates why he has become such an outstanding player in recent times. He brings together an incredible range of instruments on his most accomplished composing work to this date, and only a man whose mind is open to all kinds of new possibilities could have made this cd.I'm grateful to him for showing me that steel pans really can make beautiful music (Andy Narell on ""Homeland"" and ""Stix and Stones"") when used sparingly.In short, you've never heard anything like this cd. It probably won't hit you over the head with immediate pleasure because it is an acquired taste. But it is fairly easy to like, and it's low-key delicate beauty and sheer genius will reward you during repeated listening.Only the vocal on track nine feeling slightly out of place prevents five stars."
5,Struggle for freedom,"This was one of my favourite books when I was arround 15 years old. Selena Menard, daughter of the famous doctor who invented the cloning process, attempts to help the clones regain their lost freedom. Clones are owned by a company, known as Komsol, and are engineered into being the CPU of enormous computers that handdle all the informaion necesary to run a planet. Few of the clones are aware they are really humans. This novel takes the reader through Sven Soronson's trip from being enslaved in a computer to achieving life as a ""human being"". Along the way, a few new things are discovered about clones, maybe they are not as human as they seem ...Lief writes in a simple straight forward style, similar to Asimov. The novel is layed out as the ""foundation trilogy"". Humans scattered in a wide galaxy, inhabiting a few planets, but with the will to take over it all. This book is specially good as an introduction to Science Fiction for kids 14 and up."
4,What Eurodance should be!,"If the sweet hooks and vocals on this collection don't move you, you must not have a pulse. Sash's arrangement of synth and smooth beats mixed with the unmistakable harmonies of his honey-voiced female vocals really recall the ultra-produced danceable pop of 70's eurodance of bands like ABBA. A guilty pleasure all the way."
3,Surprisingly average,"DENY THY FATHER had the potential to really explore the conflict between Kyle and Will Riker, but it unfortunately winds up as empty as the chasm between father and son. Jeff Marriotte has a capable reign of the characters, but this book comes off reading like two separate novels fused together into one, in which neither character interacts with each other, alternating back and forth between father and son chapters. The end result is less than what it could have been. Of the five books in the six-book LOST ERA series I've read to date, this is the weakest entry of them all."
4,Good read,"I'm amused by these reviewers who complain that there's no interaction between the two Rikers in this book. If they knew their Trek they would know that in the one episode Kye Riker appeared in, it was established that there had been no interaction since Kyle abandoned Will. Given that, I think this author did a good job of showing the effect these two had on each other without having specific interaction--it's a more subtle way to tell the story, but ultimately very effective. The author shows the ties that bind generations of Rikers in a unique and interesting way."
3,Good but disappointing,I was very disappointed with this novel. It was not a terrible novel and I recommend that Star Trek fans-Riker fans in particular-take the time to get through this book.Why I was disappointed was that I knew the end. Most of the novel is split between Will Riker and his struggle from the Academy and his father running from his problems with Starfleet and his past. I waited the whole novel to see if they would come together and see them clash. They never did.One of the other problems was that Jeff Mariotte seemed to work too hard to get cameos from other characters. It seemed contrived that all these people seem to constantly cross paths even in these minimal ways. I do not object to reading and seeing how great characters like Sisko and Janeway grew to who they were but adding them in just to say you used them is a little tactless.This was a terribly tough review to write. I did not want to sound too critical but still be accurate and honest.
5,A Girl Named Rose Betty Neels Collector's Edition,"I love Betty Neels and this was one of my favorites. Blossoming into love. It was pure chance that Rose met Sybren Werdmer ter Sane, one of the most eminent surgeons in Holland. Thier accicdental meeting led her to a job, nursing Sybren's godson. Rose loved everything about her new life---including Sybren! You get to meet characters from her other books Christina and Duert ter Brandt I love it when Betty Neels does that."
4,A highly entertaining book,"The story of a joke that backfired. I appreciated this book which contains elements of a murder mystery interspersed with humour that brought a smile to my face, literally right up to the last page."
4,Fun Mystery,"I am a fan of Steve Allen's works especially of his mystery novels. This one was a page turner of the classic sense. I stayed up late late late because I couldn't put this book down.His mysteries seem to get better by the book. When I put a book down and exclaim to myself that he couldn't write a better mystery than the present, he does!My one problem with this book (and why I couldn't give it five stars) is there is a minor supporting character who is the key to a kidnapping sub-sub plot. You never find out who this character is/was and how they were able to give a false address, yet be at that address when someone shows up to interview them. (does this supporting character break into this one home every day between 9 and 5 in case someone falls for bait and show up to interview them?It may sound confusing, but it leaves a little bit of a hole in what otherwise is a fantastic read!"
3,Good characters but slow story.,"Steve Allen is asked by legendary dying comedian Benny Hartman to organize and be host of the Benny Hartman Memorial Comedy Awards. During the preparation of the show, three people are literally stabbed in the back, another is shot, and another is kidnapped. Despite this, the story moves slowly but the dramatic and clever ending makes it all worthwhile. The characters, while distinctive, don't have distinctive voices, that is, they all sound alike. But sometimes they're recognizable. For instance, one character is clearly modelled after Woody Allen and in one funny scene, Jayne catches ""Woody"" and a married woman in a motel room and ""Woody"" proceeds to whine and complain while the married woman wonders what she ever saw in him. But the biggest mystery to me is, when does Steve Allen, one of the busiest people in show business, ever have time to solve murder mysteries?"
4,Fish Bowl needs light hair,"We used this on lightly bleached hair and it didn't last long at all. So we bleached the hair almost white and it looks great. This is no reflection on the seller, very quick shipping! Thanks!"
4,Special Effects,"i really like this hair dye. it made my hair really soft, but it turned green instead of blue due to bad bleaching. It comes out really pretty for really light hair."
5,GREAT READ!!!!!!!!,"This book was positively, absolutely, great!!! There was enough emotion, intensity, and drama to keep me reading until the last page!!!! The characters were perfect and thought out very well. I loved this book enough to read it three times and I don't usually read books more than twice. I recommend this book highly!!!!"
5,Spine tingling Intrigue is Corporate Raider,This book kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to the end. Lots of twists and turns. I hope to hear more from this author in the future.
1,Corporate Raider,"This is a very poor work. On the internet dreadful punctuation and grammar made it a short lived reading experience.The characterisations are unbelievable.Idea is so-so, execution is appalling."
1,The Corporate Raider,"A VERY poorly written novel. Clunky, artificial dialogue, ridiculous characterizations, and a confusing, pointless storyline. The overall quality is amateurish in the worst sense of the word. I deeply regret purchasing this book. It's not worth the time or the money."
5,THE CORPORATE RAIDER,"THE CORPORATE RAIDER IS A MUST-READ NOVEL WITH A GREAT STORYLINE. D.VIRTUE HAS DEVELOPED TWO FASCINATING CHARACTERS, ALEX AND TAYLOR. ONCE YOU START READING YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO QUIT. MY SUGGESTION: CURL UP ON A COUCH AND SLIP INTO THE EXCITING LIFE OF A CORPORATE RAIDER AND HER UNEXPECTED LOVE INTEREST."
4,Fascinating Story,"Overall this was a very enjoyable book to read. Alex Madison's character was so intriguing that I could not put this book down!! D. Virtue did an excellent job of keeping me on the edge of my seat with the plot. Despite minor problems with grammar and editing, I was still able to really get into the characters and storyline. I can't wait for the sequel as I'm sure it will be just as exciting and fun as this one!"
5,love it,It looks just like my little pug. She doesn't know what to make of it. My boker just does a doule take of it and her sister.
4,Happy customer,My daughter was very excitied about the pug. She has been playing w/ it none stop since she got it.
5,Webkinz Pug,"It arrived just as expected. He's very soft, and my son loves to snuggle with him at night as well as play with his character on the website."
4,Webkinz Pug,The pug was shrink wrapped which kept it clean and arrived quickly.My niece will have ton's of fun with it.
4,all night long,"daz dillinger is hot,he and the doggpound someway somehow needs to get the westcoast back on the map.i know thats gonna be tough with kurupt signing with tharow but it would be a good thing.and oh yeah let dr.dre produce it that would be the smart thing and best business move for tha pound.LETS GET IT CRACKIN,YA KNOW"
2,its missing something,i bought daz's first album.i was feeling that one.To me this one is not as good.i like the g funk mellow beats with hard ryhmes and tight soulful hooks.These beats for some reason seemed kind of repetitive and to bouncy for my tastes.its alright but i recommend his debut and DPGs doggfood.
1,"Daz is corny as hell, can't rap for peanuts","Daz is over. The cd was less than ordinary. He is nothing without the skills of Kurupt (Young Gotti).The beats on this album sound horrible and the rhymes aren't very good either. Out of all the songs on this album, not even one single song stood out.But honestly, if you wanna waste your money go ahead and buy this worthless album. Daz go find another career. Mackaveli lives on and you know it. Better respect the Don."
3,Rap rap rap,"Also vocal is so-so rap-rap, a special limited DVD is for very funs only as of 37 min just two very short clips screened and talk-talk-talk is not so interesting, not much of Snoop Dog at all either."
1,SKIP GOLDEN COSMOS!,"Do NOT buy this clock from Golden Cosmos because if it is defective, they give you a hard time about giving you a return authorization number. I had to file a claim with Amazon, and got a 100% reimbursement from Amazon. I hope Amazon in the future will offer this color changing clock from another vendor."
1,This clock is junk!,"After we figured out how to operate this item, we could never get it to turn off because the tester button is on the bottom of the clock. Also, I got this for my daughter for X-mas and the entire display stopped working in February!!!"
5,Who Killed Kurt Cobain? : The Mysterious Death of an Icon,I bought this book used for my daughter as a christmas gift last year. It came in excellent condition (like new!!) She loved it. The book arrived before the expected date. I was very pleased with the purchase.
1,Smell comes right through bag!! Very Stinky!!,"I take my dog to work with me everyday. When I throw these bags in my trash can, I might as well just skip the bagging. The smell comes right through the bag and it stinks up my work area. I am talking about 1 bag being in my trash can for 5 minutes, not 5 days. I tried using the plastic bags for babies diapers and they work sooooooooo much better. There is no more smell. My trash gets emptied every night so there is no reason I should smell it. I will never get these bags again!! They are terrible!!!"
5,"A very relaxing, & soothing MUST have CD","I must say, I agree that this is a wonderfully put together romantic jazz collection. I would recommend this CD to everyone."
4,Under Rated,"I wholeheartedly agree with other reviewers who have essentially said that this is perhaps the most under rated and under appreciated CD by Linda Ronstadt. ""Easy for you to say"" written by Jim Webb is a beautiful and emotional song. Her treatment of the song shows her feel for Webb's music, and it is my favorite Ronstadt song. The rest of the CD is solid, Lindaespecially the title track and her duet with James Taylor. I only wish a remastered version of this CD would become available."
2,Disappointing For Me,"Hard to beat Mad Love, and this one doesn't come close. The songs as a whole seem too screechy and too percussive. (Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations, and give a thumbs up--four or five stars--only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song.)"
3,What's new? Not much...,"After getting a taste of Broadway via the hammy operetta ""Pirates of Penzance"", Ronstadt returned to pop-rock with this woefully uneven and strident collection of quickie tracks. There's actually real, genuine emotion only in a handful of cuts: ""Mendocino"", ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"", the thoughtful and sad ""Sometimes You Just Can't win"", and the spritely James Taylor duet ""Think It's Gonna Work Out Fine"". The rest is harry-karry, running rampant from '50's Detroit-rock to soul-sister nonsense."
2,Not Happy with this CD,"Even though this was a used CD, the case was in bad shape and scratched up - which I easily replaced with a new case, so why didn't the seller...but I was REALLY UPSET over the fact that there was NO FRONT COVER to this CD!! That was never mentioned when it was advertised. I'm not happy at all about that, and will never buy from that seller again!"
5,Ronstadt starts to find her true voice,"Get Closer is the first pop album Ronstadt made after doing Pirates of Penzance--and it shows in her voice, full of more muscle and control than ever before. Especially affecting are the two Jimmy Webb ballads, the beginning of Ronstadt and Webb's long musical affiliation: the bitter ""Easy For You to Say"" and the pensive ""The Moon's A Harsh Mistress."" Ronstadt is in top form here. There's a powerhouse cover of ""I Knew You When"" with an octave jumping ending that just grabs you. Also touching is Ronstadt's ""Mr. Radio"" with its eerie arrangement and the imagery-laden ""Talk to Me of Mendicino."" A must for any Ronstadt aficionado."
3,Microbiology the easy way,"The book is decent but it's no great reference. It's best used the way the book states, accompanying a course that you're having problems understanding. It has decent depth for the topics it discusses but if you're using this for anything other than a general microbiology course you'll need something else. Does not have a good reference for bacteria or viruses which can be frustrating when trying to do class examples."
5,Micro...,Highly useful tool fostered more insight o the subject after reading it. Allows the reader an opportunity to review when timing is limited.
5,Great supplement to your learning,"I am a nursing student and had to take Microbiology last semester. I was on a tight budget, so I took a chance and purchased this book instead of the recommended textbook. I studied my lecture notes and this book and made an A. The book is easy to understand and has pictures to help you understand certain concepts. The chapters are well organized and coincided with the chapters in the textook. Buy the book!"
4,"like Brat Farrar, except totally different","I bought this book because it was compared to one of my all-time favourite English novels, Brat Farrar by Josephine Tey. Turns out this is kind of a homage to Brat Farrar and makes reference to it, but the story is very different. It's set in Canada, in the present, and it's about a young woman trying to solve an old mystery. It's still entertaining and enjoyable and fun to read, though, whether you're familiar with Brat Farrar or not. Funny and sad in parts and a well-paced mystery. I recommend it."
5,HIGH SCHOOL ALL OVER AGAIN !!!!!!! 6 AUG 1999,"THIS IS THE ALL TIME GREATEST ""FORGOTTEN"" SOUNDTRACK IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC!!!! WITH TRACKS LIKE QUARTERFLASH'S DON'T BE LONELY AND STEVIE NICK'S SLEEPING ANGEL THESE SONGS ARE NOT ONLY GREAT SONGS, BUT REALLY MAKE YOU RELIVE ALL OF THOSE FEELINGS YOU FELT BACK THEN. WITH FANTASTIC SONGS FROM HAGAR, SQUIER, AND BUFFETT ...I'M HAVING FLASH BACKS!!!"
5,Excellent!,"The only downside on this was they didnt include Led Zeppelins track Kashmir , but Sammys Fast Times at Ridgemont High made up 4 it!"
3,Too Commercial For My Taste,"All of the music on this soundtrack is very commercial by mainstream artists. I have a more of an alternative taste. Think more the music from the Valley Girl and John Hughes soundtrack films. These artists are very middle of the road. There are really not any songs that I am wild about but the ones I enjoy most on this soundtrack are:Jackson Browne - Somebody's BabyThe GoGo's - SpeedingSammy Hagar - Fast Times at Ridgemont HighStevie Nicks - Sleeping AngelOingo Boingo - Goodbye, GoodbyeThe worst two songs on this soundtrack are:Timothy B. Schmit - So Much In LoveGraham Nash - Love Is The ReasonIf you really enjoy these artists then you will probably enjoy this soundtrack more than me. I just wished they took more chances and steered further away from the top artists of the day.These songs will remind you of particular scenes from the movie so you will find yourself reliving the movie as you listen to the cd. That's a good thing because I love the movie itself."
2,Ain't a soundtrack without Phoebe Cates!,"As other reviewers have noted, this soundtrack DOES NOT contain the song playing when Phoebe Cates takes off her bikini top. THE WHOLE POINT OF THE SOUNDTRACK. That would be ""Movin' in Stereo"" by The Cars.It's like if you buy the Casino Royale soundtrack and don't get the Chris Cornell title track, or buy the Superbad soundtrack and don't get McLovin's dance track (Boogeyman). Read ALL the customer reviews, and you won't make the mistake I did in buying a soundtrack without the actual soundtrack!"
1,unbelievably bad soundtrack to a GREAT film,"I am an avid soundtrack collector, and this one rates up with the worst. Not only are most of the songs not even in the film, but they're just plain horrible examples of each artist's work. There are only 2 songs worth listening to... ""Somebody's Baby"" by Jackson Browne (unavailable on his albums) and ""Sleeping Angel"" by Stevie Nicks."
1,"Has the concepts and examples, but so many errors.","This book is very comprehensive in covering all beginner aspects of database concepts. However, there are so many errors in this book I absolutely had to sell it because I couldn't stand keeping such a book. For the fifth edition I was very disappointed. The ERD symbols were incorrect, and there are typos galore. You actually have to know all about databases to actually read past the errors and understand everything. For someone who doesn't know database concepts, this book will only lead you to make errors when you try and apply the practices. I hope 6th edition is much better."
1,Unreasonable amount of errors,"There are more errors in this text book than in any other text book that I have ever seen. In addition to frequency, some are huge, gaping errors in diagrams and equations that completely confuse the subject. Along with this, there is supplemental content that is mentioned in the text as being available on the website that does not even exist (at least at the time of this writing) and the content that is actually available has the quality of being produced during a weekend of absinthe binging. The quality of this text is totally unacceptable for a 6th edition and even more so considering the exorbitant price."
1,Not helpful,"I don't know any better database textbook to recommend,but I know this book is not one of them. Beside mention of ""unreasonable amount of error"", this book is not quite helpful. Some of the text is very wordy. Also, the author have been published new textbook EVERY YEAR. The homework problem is just flipping around. The chapters are just rearrange and re-word. I has to buy the new edition just because the homework problems rearrange."
1,Good only for presenting the concept.,"Too simplistic and way below computer science level. Good for an average user, who just wants to learn the concepts and theories but not going to actually create a database! It's all theories and theories and theories!I sure know what a ""primary key"" is or what ""relationships"" are and how many kinds exist, etc, etc ... but it didn't really teach me how to create it. Just one or two vague examples, that's all."
3,Could have been a lot better if they put more effort,providing more detail on certain very important topics like Tuple Relational Calculus and also spend a lot more time going into more detail of creating more complex queries. These are the topics I was really looking forward too. But that being said theres so much information in this book its defiintely worth the price. Also they could simplify the language a bit when talking about complex topics optimization techniques used by the engine and some aspects of file organization.
1,Worthless,"I've read both this one and ""DATABASE SYSTEMS: A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND MANAGEMENT"" (Connolly/Begg), and the latter is by far the best. Some ideas that takes a few seconds to grasp Connollys book, took me about a half an hour to grasp in this one (which I noticed when I tried to refresh my memory). The reason is that it is written in a sometimes incredibly difficult and complex way. Why? For no good reason at all, as far as I can see. The descriptions are not any more ""rigorous"" or ""exact"", they are just difficult without gaining anything. The ideas are the same.Avoid it, unless you want to waste you time with a book that makes learning 10 times slower than with a good one."
4,there's a stronger hub,"Bought for my Dana 35 TTB front axle on ranger. I'm really happy with these hubs. Installation is a breeze and I'm finally done with my pos auto hubs. But.... I discovered after buying these ""that they are not as strong as the P/N 37780 hubs that Warn introduced together with their full-float rear axle conversion kits for the YJ and TJ Jeep Wranglers. Because these hubs were to be used on a rear axle, they had to be very strong. This became the time Warn had to finally upgrade their somewhat weak ""Top-hat"" style hubs. The Jeep hub is physically no different on the outside than the standard hub. It is a 100% direct replacement.""quoted from [...]So why not buy the stonger ones instead?Do your own research first, I didn't buy 37780 I bought 29071 which I'm reviewing now, but I believe the above info to be true."
5,Great product!,These work great in place of the auto locking hubs that come factory. Even though you must engage them manually it is well worth knowing you have a decent 4x4 system.
5,No rebuild kits available,"I wish I could only have bought one of these, but they were only sold in pairs so now I have a backup. The hubs are easy to put on, except they take 2 special axle nuts per axle. Each round nut has 4 slots and needs a special tool to tighten (torque). I had zero luck trying to find rebuild kits for this hub. If they exist they might have been cheaper. The last hub I had got ruined from loose axle nuts."
5,"well, saxon is...saxon.","this band has been around at nearly the same time as Iron Maiden but i didnt know that until i stumbled upon a dusty tape saying ""Best of Saxon"", in a record shop about 10 years ago. while listening to the heavily bluesy intro of ""the eagle has landed"" and to the amazing Christopher Cross cover (ride like the wind), my opinion about saxon is summed up in 2 words: Hell Yeah. But wait! there's more treats in store! Denim and leather, Broken heroes, 747, princess of the night... Saxon's discography is full of ups and downs; their bad albums are like, really bad while their good albums are simply magnificent, fresh sounding and kick-butt all the way: try ""unleash the beast"" ""solid ball of rock"" ""innocence is no excuse"" or ""strong arm metal"" and be ready for impeccable, high revving heavy metal. in the meanwhile try getting this compilation which sums Saxon's early years up til '92 and enjoy!!"
1,OK...,"...this site is lying...there's no such thing as ""The Best of Saxon""...or if there is...then there's only one song: Witchfinder General!!>"
5,Anyone with any interest in music will want a copy.,"This is a great reference book, textbook, bedside table book, beach read--you name it! You can trust what Hoffman tells you about music, and he tells it with subtlety, elegance, and wit. Anyone with any interest in music will want a copy."
4,NPR classical music companion,"This is a great book and easily worth the price. I would have liked a bit more an composers, but overall it is exactly what I wanted."
3,Basic stuff - details are non-existant,Most of the stuff you really want to know about qmail is not found in this book. A typical installation is not discussed. You'd be much better off at the qmail.org web site.
4,A good start for learning qmail,"If spending your whole career devoted to configuring Sendmail doesn't excite you, try qmail. It is a good email server and is much easier to work with.This book is a good place to start if you decide to go with qmail. It is pretty easy to read and while it probably doesn't tell you everything you'll want to know, it will help you get your email server up and running while you are still young."
5,This was just what I needed,This was a great book to help setting up Qmail from start to finish. It told me just what I needed to do step by step and got me up and running. Easy to read and follow even for someone with just a little-better-than-basic understanding of Linux.
5,"You want Free, Secure, Mail without the headache?","You can either take a handfull of your favorite pain killers & search the net for some information (very little, and what is available is cryptic to say the least); or Buy This BOOK!Everything you ever wanted to know about qmail, but were afraid (or in too much pain) to ask. Qmail is by far the best mail server out there, it has everything you could ask for from Sendmail or Postfix, with the added bonus of security taken seriously.I have been running qmail for some time now, but never got everything I wanted out of it. This book helped me fine tune my mail services, manage virtual domains, aliases and various mailbox formats.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone running qmail, or considering migrating from another server."
5,Highly Recommended!,"One of Gus's best albums, the 1st 4 songs are some of the best Gus has done,and the acoustic version of the title track at the end is haunting. This is also the album with Paranoid cover. AS a bonus there is an awesome DVD that comes with this CD that has a majority of the songs on the CD being performed. Def a must have CD."
4,Cuttin' Horse Pocket Knife,"My husband received this pocket knife as a gift from a friend and liked it so well, that when he lost it - I knew I needed to order this. When my husband received the New knife he was so pleased. My purchase of this knife was a very good choice!"
4,Quality cleats,"The cleats is of good quality that offered excellent traction on grass, loose and hard dirt. Did not need to break in to the shoes as it is in game ready condition. Only drawback was the cloth front, which ripped when a base runner slid onto it."
3,Worth getting for the serious fan,"I only had a few Ozric CDs left to buy so I picked this up slightly used. There are some moments of brilliance along with some forgettable material on these discs. It is less polished than their later work.A few standouts I like are on Slidling Gliding World, mainly because they are really weird or unique: The Code for Chickendon, Sliding and Gliding and Fetch Me the Pongmaster. The latter has one of the cooler bass riffs in any Ozric song."
3,So-so,"Well written in places with some narrative momentum, but this book has lots of problems. It is supposed to be a period piece/historical novel about the 1970's, but the references are just sprinkled in every 2 or 3 pages and don't really have anything to do with the plot -- could have been set in almost any era. Second, the two teenage boys around whom the plot revolves act very implausibly for boys of their age. I must say I did like the portrayal of the Vietnam veteran character (I am one) -- nicely balanced. Tom Wolfe's A Man in Full is a better look at the same subject."
2,NOT GLUE!,"Even thoug this product is labeled as 'Got 2 b Glued', it's consistency is unlike the version that comes in the tube. It's a lot runnier and is more like a gel versus a 'glued' effect."
5,got 2b glued,I have curly hair and this is the ONLY product that I have used for YEARS. It truly fights the frizzies !
4,Good seller,I love the older version of this product better. My hair is trouble so I won't say this is not a very good product... It doesn't work very well on my hair probably because of my hair.What I want to say is that this seller is really nice and responsible! Thanks.
5,Got 2b Glued Rubber Cement 6-Ounce Tubes,"I love this product. I am able to wash my hair and put this on and let it mostly air dry. Then fluff it and back comb a little and I have fluff, curls, and waves where I want. I always used to get perms to get curly hair, and now, since I found this product, I do not have to have perms. Please do not take it off the market. L Hodges"
4,"He is not quite the one, but he was great","In 1998 with the release of Veneno, Cortes was fading, but still had his swan song. Veneno is excellent, though not at the level of his best work. In fact, it's not particularly a contest. This is a strong album, with Verano Habanero specially standing out, and a lot of very strong supporting tracks, but it is not a classic on the level of his Timba work from En La Calle to La Bruja *minus La Que Manda, which is OK, but probably inferior even to Veneno*.Cortes' last hurrah. Very much worth it."
2,5 stars; yeah right.,"Not very good, a lot of subjective views. Not a very interesting read, just a lot of boring concepts and terminology."
2,Too many unanswered questions,"The author of this book likes to complain about why the ""folk art"" of Information Security and the ""CIA foundation"" is currently missing the mark. After the first four chapters I was more than aware of the author's opinions on this. I wasted too much of my time reading what is wrong and not enough time on making it right. There is useful info in this book, you just have to get through the pessimistic viewpoints."
2,Starts good but ends up in the blue,"The first chapters are quite good, but then the content really goes off into the blue. There are a few interesting things in all chapters, but overall I would not recommend anyone to buy this book. It's not that I'm a 100% computer nerd who don't like non-technical books, but most of this book is a lot of talk that doesn't connect very well with real down-on-earth things. The only people I can imagine who would like this book are complete newbies to information security who are coming from the academic world and never have been exposed to the field in practice. There's nothing wrong with theory, but it has to connect to the real world in a way that you really can use it."
4,The price is right.,"All I can say is that since my Bocanegra started taking this vitamins his coat is shinnier and his playfulness has increased. But these vitamins have a very STRONG smell, my whole household knows when the dog's food is being prepared.. Other that everything is just perfect."
3,es dificil acomodar al lente,"Funciona muy bien para fotos de estomatología, es un poco dificil para acomodar el lente en una cybershot."
5,using with a Fujitsu Stylistic tablet computer,"It's perfect -- the tablet is almost worthless for playing any kind of audio without it, but works perfectly for playing back voicemail, etc. with the Tritton plugged in."
5,Must Have For LapTop,Ok I got these speakers today they are simply Amazing!I have a acer laptop 5610 with vista and the onboard speakers are not very loud so i ordered the sound bite usb speakers. Well I wish I would of bought these a year ago they are Loud I can hear my laptop now for dvd or videos or whatever. All I had to do was plug the usb cord in and the computer set it all up by itself i didnt use the driver disc that came with it no need. This is going to be awesome now I can enjoy stuff without having to use headphones to hear it good.Well worth the 25 Bucks you cant go wrong and its so compact it will be easy to take along with your laptop. I cant say enough about this product it definately gets five stars *****
1,Do NOT buy from this seller.,"I bought this ipod and it started acting up like my old one. I contacted apple, told them I bought it on amazon, they were willing to fix it. Sent it to apple, got a call when it arrived saying it was indeed the shell of the apple but the inside parts were n't their parts. Do not buy from this seller. I gave it a 1 star, because it wouldn't let me go any lower."
4,My first ipod and I love it.,I bought this ipod used. It's the first ipod I have owned and I must say I loved it. The product came in great condition and overall I am very pleased.
3,poor user instructions,"yes, it's nice but how does it do all it's suppose to do? I downloaded the user's manual and looked at the video demos and they mainly tell you what it WILL do but not how to do it in detail. For instance it says in order to download music to your iPod after the data has been stored to your computer ""go to 'source' in iTunes and find 'options'"" and then it continues it's instructions. I CAN'T FIND the 'OPTIONS' they are talking about. Does somebody know of a more detailed user's instructions I can get that is NOT distributed by the Apple people, just some 'good ole joe/jane' that can talk people talk and not company advertising talk? Thanks, Sub"
5,What else can I say but...,"What else can I say but ""it's excellent!!! I enjoy using it, traveling with it, using it to carry music and video's, and talking books, back and forth to work. The only thing it needs is a convienient way to hook it up to my car speaker system with out major surgery."
3,Not bad,"I bought the 60GB refurbished. It took a long time to get to my place ( i think i ordered from digimedia?) and the tracking information was non-existant until the item was delivered. I got the Ipod and it only had a small scratch on the screen and a few small ones on the back, but no big deal. I have had a few problems with it freezing and refusing to charge and I don't know if that is a common problem with all ipods or if its just because i bought a used one. I don't know. Was 175 dollars refurb. Just an FYI, the apple store online sells the 80 gig refurbs for 169 and do not charge shipping. The just don't always have them in stock. Buy refurbished from apple directly and you get the manufacturer warranty."
1,Don't buy it if you actually want it to work.,"I have a 40gb ipod that died 13 months after I bought it. I bought the extended warranty and apple replaced it with an ipod that died after 3 months (this was last week). The apple store exchanged it under warranty with an ipod that had problems the 1st day. There are lots of people with similar problems in the apple store every time I go in as well as several friends with similar problems. The software and accessories are cool, but what good is it when the ipods don't work. Horrible quality especially for $400. Buy another brand."
1,Apple still have major reliability problems,First unit stopped working within first year. Even the replacement unit stopped working in 3 months. Apple will not cover second unit failure in warranty. Apple still have a serious reliability problem in my experience.
1,Beware of Apple iPods,I own an iPod 40G which worked great for 14 months. (The warranty period is of course 12 months). It is now a $400 paperweight. Apple's estimated repair cost is $280 which they want up front to repair it. My advice: By something cheaper. At least you won't be out as much if dies.
1,Don't buy an Ipod - It will just break,"Everyone I know (including me) who has an Ipod, has sadly watched them break in the first year. My touch pad stopped responding to touch. You should be prepared for your $400 purchase to last less than a year. Just look at all the broken Ipods on Ebay."
1,80GB 5.5 Generation is here!,I'm not sure if people are still buying this now but I just wanted to let you know that you can get a brand new 80GB video iPod for 349.00 (381.00 after tax in TN). I love mine and couldn't be happier!
5,Love it!,"This was a present for my husband, and he has gotten a lot of use out of it. A very cool gift!"
3,"Great player, hard to find Accessories","I bought my 60GB model through the Apple website along with some accessories. This was my first iPod purchase and I am very happy with the unit and how easy it was to load it with my mp3 library. The unit is small elegant and packed with features. However, I was disappointed to find no AC charger included (I had wanted to use one in my office and the IT folks won't allow me to load the software to use the USB cable). I was also disappointed to find out I could not easily find a case for this model (hopefully they will be available soon). The biggest disappointment was that many of the accessories for previous models (including FM transmitters) are incompatible with this model since there is only a headphone jack and no charging jack on the top. I'm sure the after market guys will soon develop more accessories, but it is frustrating to own the flagship model and not be able to use it in the same manner as people who own less expensive or older models."
2,Not much of an upgrade,"I upgraded to the new 60gb iPod from a 3rd generation 40 GB model. I used to have a remote control I could clip on my lapel. No more. I used to be able to update songs at 400Mb/s with Firewire. No more -- I do not have the very latest Mac, and Firewire transfers are ""not supported,"" so I have to update at USB 1.0 speeds. I am not sure my new iPod will be fully loaded by the time my flight leaves the day after tomorrow. I'm seriously considering returning this."
2,"Scratch magnetic, fragile","Sound quality is OK, not the best, not the worst.Pro:Look niceSound better than other cheap mp3 playersBig and vibrant color screenSlimWheel clickCon:Shiny face, chrome back-plate scratches extremely easy.Fragile, once dropped, kiss $150 goodbye for repairNon removeable batteryNo ""standard"" accessories like AC charger or a caseI bought 3 cases for it, all of them adds more scratch to ipod. Tried to clean it with soft cloth but noooo.... more more scratches... and my ipod looks like junk now. Once it is scratched, it has no value for selling.... with that said.. my $300 ipod video is functioning but its value is worthless."
1,Apple Video Ipod 60 GB,"Not a good compatibility with most of the song formats. When i try to transfer songs to this IPOD, it tries to convert them to itunes, which does not work for 50 % of the songs. I should have rather bought an mp3 player / flash drive."
4,Good Buy,"It is a good buy. I bought the 60GB with video and have no regrets except that it is heavy. When I fix this on an all in one FM transmitter, I fear it may fall down. Other than that the product is excellent. Very easily scratchable."
2,Buyer Beware,I sold my old ipod(40gig iphoto) to buy the new 60g video ipod. Well in short you get nothing with your new ipod no charger no dock just the usb cable and a cheap case. If you own the iphoto keep it because you have to go through a lot of garbage just to get video on the ipod to work and the ipod itself. Unless you own a ibook look at other mp3 players before buying.
1,unreliable ipod,"Well, I haven't bought the new Ipod. I'm onto my third (yes, 3rd!!!) 40Gb ipod and it has just died, like its predecessors. They won't fix it, but will sell you a ""refurbished"" model for $180 Australian. This suggests to me that they will fix the duds I have handed in and then resell them to somebody else. But don't try to buy one of these refurbished models. They look brand new and are under half the new price, but they will only sell you one if you have a broken one to trade in. I bet they do a roaring trade given the unreliability of these objects. They look great and the interface is a work of art. But zero reliability, zero support, and if you want it to do anything other than play music through cheap ear phones supplied with it, be prepared to pay lots extra. I'm going to but some other brand. Suggest you do too, until Apple begins to grow some consideration for its customers."
5,Ipod,"I bought the Ipod as a Christmas gift for my 16 year old son. He absolutely loves it. It is very stylish and lightweight. Also, he says that the memory capacity is probably even more than he needs.The product was shipped and received in a timely manner and I will definitely purchase again from amazon.com."
4,Mike,"This is the first Ipod I've bought and I'm pretty impressed. I put about 1000 songs and 200 pics on it and only used about 5 gbs. The sound, even thru the earpieces, is excellent and it has tons of space for all kinds of stuff from podcasts to music and pictures. Itunes software is also great and makes downloads a breeze. The one problem though is that it scratches in it VERY easy so if you buy one get a good case to go with it. Mine had several scratches on it within a few hours of having it and I even kept it in the case that comes with it. Also, unless you buy the adapter for $30, the only way to recharge it is to hook it up to your computer. They say that the battery can last for 20 hours on a charge, but I think its probably less than that. Still a great product!"
4,"Great hadware, software could be better","I love my new iPod. I bought this one after my 60GB iPod Photo was ""misplaced"". I had a library of about 6,000 songs (small for what this thing can hold) and the first time I updated the new iPod with the library I got error messages every 700 songs or so. I had to restart the whole updating process about 9 times until I finally got al my songs into the iPod. This was problem number one (which I don't expect to happen again unless I update the iPod whith more than 700 songs at a time).Problem number two: if I'm searching for a song by artist, it won't display all the songs I have by that artist in the iPod. Say I have like 20 songs by Madonna, and I search for Madonna on the artists menu, I only get like 5 of the 20 songs there are. That didn't happen with my old iPod.But all in all, it's a great product and I would buy it all over again if I had to."
5,Good Stuff,Would recommend it - coupled with the Bose Sound Deck it makes a good guest room music system
4,"Great player, no charger","I just received mine and am very impressed by the display. I had suspected that video playback on this machine was merely a gimic, especially the television downloads, but it is surprisingly watchable. Note to Steve Jobs: I need Sopranos downloads!The problem with this package is what's not in the box. There is no charger, no dock, no decent case (which given the propensity to scratch is a clear and present danger). Apple is well known for scrimping on required accessories, but they have sunk to a new low with this package. Let's face it, they kept the price at the previous levels only by eliminating essential components and forcing us to buy them separately.Summary: Buy the player; you'll love it. But make sure you've got a hundred bucks left over to get the rest of the stuff you'll need."
5,"Beautiful screen, huge hard drive","I upgraded from the U2 black and white iPod mainly because I wanted a color screen. The screen is a major reason to get this iPod. It is crisp, sharp, and the font is much easier to read than the B&W; models.The video ability is a nice add-on, but not really important for me. I have an Archos PVP and found that watching videos longer than a few minutes on a small screen is annoying. Plus without a backrest, I can't imagine watching a movie with the iPod -- holding it in the hand for 1 1/2 hours doesn't seem like much fun.The 60gb space for me is fantastic. Although I have over 60,000 songs in my collection, I am able to put tons of songs on the iPod.One note of caution: a few hours after I had mine, I noticed several hairline scratches all over the front of it, from the left of the wheel all the way onto the screen. I'm not sure if this is a nano-like issue, but it scratched easy and fast.Apple needs to address that issue. Otherwise, this iPod is a work of art!"
2,Scartch Heaven,"I bought this thing and I've had it for less than 2 days and I'm dissatisfied. The first thing you see once you wipe the Ipod with your shirt is a million small scratches on the surface.The battery is internal and since it doesn't last a ""forever"", you have to send it back to Ipod and pay extra money to get it replaced.Video Ipod? Yeah... I couldn't even put my DVDs on it because Apple only accepts certain formats which are easy to put on there once you buy shows and movies from them (smart marketing).The only good thing about it is the capacity.Bottom Line: Even before I've experienced this product, I thought it was overrated. Now I can confirm this. The Ipod is overrated, it is overpriced, and unless you want to buy something for $400 which will look like garbage in less than a week, don't buy it. $400 is definetely not worth the ""quality""."
4,Good job,"The movie comes close in spirit to the book. I thoroughly enjoy Stevenson's books and I'm glad to see that there seems to be a series going here. Even though Strachey is different in my mind from the portayal in the movie, I enjoyed the different interpretation. Jack Wetherall is wonderful and the radical outer and Sebastian Spence is perfect as Timothy. There are plot variations but overall this is a good tribute to the essence of the book. More of that Stevenson repartee, please, as time goes on."
2,Disappointing!,"Since I am a huge fan of M/M romance and erotic gay I was looking forward to this movie. It was very innocent and it was sex by innuendo (which I do not appreciate) They gave us nothing in the bedroom, except they went under the covers and fade to black. It was a good murder mystery. They tried to make the detective hard and gritty but it did not work for me because of the pretty house, his pretty 'wife' the pretty neighbourhood. It was really a gay Nancy Boy Drew Murder Mystery. I wish I had not bought the DVD."
2,Oh my gosh!,"I have never seen such bad acting, the peoples voices being so annoying and still being able to get through the movie finding any of them attractive at all! The script was mediocre, the acting was attrocious, one of the main characters caught my eye so I made it through!"
3,Worth a look,"This film has been well reviewed by several others which led me to buy it in the first place. I found the cast to be very solid, but although the story line deserves praise for the credible--and very likable--characters and their relationships, over time, the plot fades and ultimately finishes without much credibility. Moral ambiguity is pretty much a staple in police dramas like ""Law and Order"" these days, but somehow the writer didn't pull it off in this film. Nevertheless, there is plenty to like here--especially the actors--and I would certainly give the next installment a try."
4,Loved the movie,Loved this movie over all...weak in spots but it was all made up with the second movie. Buy it and add it to your collection today!
3,Gay Detective Swings Wide,"Third Man Out is a low-budget flick on DVD about a gay private eye in Albany New York, who gets entangled in the murder of a gay activist who is outing well-known people in the community. The activist has made a number of enemies. The flick has a lot of clichés, phony-sounding dialogue, some frontal nudity, hackneyed situations, weak acting, and occasional stabs at humor. The detective is of the hard-boiled variety who bullies confessions out of witnesses. This movie may be a break-through for future gay crime dramas that have more artistic merit. It's a diverting piece of fluff for a rainy afternoon if you're short of good books to read."
4,Good story line.,"I liked the story line. Didn't show a gay man in the sterotypical role. We need more movies that show us as normal gay couples. I really liked the movie, good drama but could have been better if Hollywood would put more money into movies like this."
4,Same Gender Scam Affairs,"A good idea, a twisted script and not so bad performing of a detective story with same gender affair context are all-in-one while a private detective reluctantly protects activist black-mailing an entire world and his own protector mercilessly.Perhaps, this work very notion is pointing at psycho-mental grounds of over-activism regardless good intentions one could imagine for."
3,Promising,"I was curious about Chad Allen's new movie and decided to buy the movie based on earlier reviews I had read. I liked the movie, but found a number of things disturbing. The plot had many twists and kept me guessing, but I found the movie to be a bit depressing, although not every movie has to be a feel good experience. This is quite a different kind of gay movie and a lot more realistic than most that I have seen."
1,Doesn't Fit,Order this clip for my Motorola Krazer -- it does not fit. The holster is too short and doesn't clip over the top of the phone which causes it to slip out. Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. Not worth the postage to ship the item back.
4,Great live Sonny Boy II Performance,"Great show by Sonny Boy. (Other CD's combine the nine sonny boy cuts here with the ones from the American Folk Blues Festival (with a band led by Willie Dixon) and the ones backed by the Yardbirds. Better choice, if that's all you're looking for. The Animals performances are good fun, but not indispensable. The last track is actually ""Going Down Slow"" by James Oden, best known as by Howlin' Wolf."
5,Music to brighten your mood,"A lovely, if rather parsimonious (only 40 minutes) collection of songs like I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now, The Ash Grove, and the title song Listen to the Mockingbird. A quartet of singers with the backing of an instrumental quartet who all blend beautifully, the performances are ideal. As the performers are astonishingly not listed on the CD, the jewel case, or in the enclosed booklet, here they are:Raymond Beegle: piano, artistic directorLisa Messier: sopranoMary Ann Hart: mezzo-sopranoGregory Mercer: tenorPaul Rowe: baritoneKatherine Hoover: fluteBarbara Chapman: harpTheodore Mook: celloHighly recommended whenever your mood needs brightening."
5,Great show for kids,"Although these episodes are only 15 minutes in length each one has its own special appeal. The animated puppets create a unique visual treat that cannot be matched by animated shows. There are a large number of characters that are introduced in the first volume and I do not know how four voice actors came up with so many unique voices but they did. I have not started volume two but I expect the quality to be the same.The stories cover the adventures of Torchy and his trips to Topsy-Turvy land. The story content is stronger, thanks to Roberta Leigh, than some of Gerry Anderson's later projects that relied heavily on special effects. Some of the episodes try to teach moral stories. Songs, sung by the voice actors, are included in some of the episodes.The video (black and white) quality is very good but a step below what you will see in the Fireball XL-5 puppet series. This makes little difference since the quality of the show is what counts."
3,Wrong DVD sent,"This is not a review of the content, but a warning, as one of the reviewers wrote, I ordered 1st and 2nd series, but only was sent the 2nd series, completely different DVD."
1,I ordered this BUT was sent the COMPLETE SECOND SERIES only...,Where is the first series? My receipt says THE COMPLETE FIRST & SECOND SERIES but AMAZON only sent the COMPLETE SECOND SERIES. Great show and quality BUT missing a year :)
3,Nice Series,"This is the complete series, 52 episodes, which come in around 15 minutes each. Nice puppeteer work. Not as polished as Supercar, it's still worth a look."
2,Not Worth the Price,"Although printed on better-than-average paper, this English import is only fair. I cannot imagine toddlers being that interested in the book; it appears most valuable as an early reader (the book contains only 21 unique words). The pictures are big and bright, something an infant might like. There's nothing that bad about it, it's just not very unique and certainly not worth the price."
2,"Portfolio, not Presentation case","Prat generally makes very good quality cases. This case is nicely made. I gave it two stars because it is listed as a ""presentation portfolio"" case. It is a portfolio case. The presentation cases have ring binders where you can put refillable sheets in them, which this one does not have. I paid 35 plus 10 for shipping which is what you can get this for just about anywhere. Also, for being brand new, it had dings an nicks on it and it was shipped in a flattened box."
1,"disorganized, scattered, and not understandable","This text is awful. It is disorganized in it's teaching and it is not written in an understandable format. If anything, this text makes it harder to understand discrete math than it should be. I think another reveiwer said it best when he/she wrote: If I could understand this book I wouldn't need it."
2,Find a Different Book,"The writing of this book is complete garbage. Every chapter is riddled with either non-sense proofs or complete mathematical jargon. They fail to put the concepts into writing understandable to someone who isn't a mathematician. On top of that the book is very quick paced. Constantly there are several page proofs/derivations that confuse you more than help you understand the simple equation shown shortly after. The book does offer helpful ""check-up"" exercises at the end of each section allowing you to check if you need to make another attempt at deciphering the previous section's jibberish. All in all, if you struggle with math vocabulary I suggest to choose another book. On the contrary if you excel at math and understand math terminology with ease this book might help you quickly learn discretionary mathematics."
1,Hard to understand,"As a first year college student, I find this book really hard to understand. It assumes that the student has already learned the technical language it is using(only learned JAVA, not sure what kind language appears in the book). If it uses basic mathematical way to explain the problem, I think it would be easier to learn"
2,Pretty bad,This book is written terribly. They immediately use very technical language and don't ease beginners into the subject. They never uses concrete physical examples and jump straight into the abstract. This a horrible approach to teach people math. Most people are able to understand the abstract only after a concrete example. I am one of those people. The internet at large is a much better resource.
1,What is this pricey thing?,"Some sort of description would help... preferrably a track listing, maybe a photo too. I'm trying to figure out what is so special about the item that makes it so expensive."
4,Good so far,"I ordered Rainbow Light's vitamin C because of good experience with their other products (e.g.,Rainbow Light All-Zyme Double Strength, Plant-Source, Vcaps, 180 vcaps). Tried them recently. Hard to tell whether they really help or not of course, but I feel reasonably confident about this supplier. Also, in this product, the acid of Vitamin C is buffered, which should be good for a sensitive stomach.The pills are rather large, among the largest I can remember, but they are covered with some special vegetable glaze (the whole thing is vegan, BTW) and go down pretty well, better than some smaller pills. They do seem to be easy on one's stomach. They look pleasant and smell fresh, not too acidic like some other Vitamin C tablets we had in the past."
1,****Contains Soy Lecithen*****,I was very disappointed when I read the label-it has soy lecithen also. I'm sure it would be a great supplement if the company discontinued their use of soy in all their products... They are based here in Sunny Calif. in Santa Cruz of all places (health and hippy central) so I would think that they would realize the negative effect soy is having on our health....StaceyCaliforniaStandardPoodle.com
3,Some problems with the cable,"I wanted and asked for a transom for a Garmin 300C, i found this but there weren't indication that this transom uses a six legs cable and the Garmin 300C uses a four legs cable. So, i should buy a 6 to 4 legs cable. this information is important to be in the description."
1,save your money,poor quality printing with very few photo's and what they were was not up to today's standards
3,Some good features,"I got this while it was free after rebate. There are some useful features in here such as clip art and a text designer. Other parts such as the button tool are practically useless. Some parts of the program have a good interface and look while others just feel sort of cheap. I'm glad I got this, but I wouldn't if I had payed more than $20 for it. $50 is certainly way too much to pay."
1,"Not work your money, time and effort","Well the 2 guys were lucky. I bought it because of the ""free after rebate"" promo but I NEVER GOT the rebate. Same issue with the 4 other items I got for ""free after rebate"". After I've submitted the orignal receipts and UPC symbol and rebate form, they send me a card to tell me that it was a duplicate, then later on after I contacted them about it to testify that it was an original, they say that they don't have a record of my submissions. Bull!!I check http://www.elibrium.com recently and I couldn't get to the page. I was able to before. Perhaps this company is going out of business... and scamming people on their way down.What a lesson for me."
5,best metal album ever,i you consider yourself a true mmetal fan to any degree you need to own this album its metallicas best i cant believe some people have given this album anything under 5 stars
5,Metal plain and simple,What is a heavy metal collection with out any MetallicA cd...especially this one. Why some people ask because this cd is packed with hard hitting music that must be played so loud your speakers blow out. This is music that gets you ready for war. Personally my favorite song is Creeping Death because it is a story lived through the song. But most importantly For Whom the Bell Tolls still gives me the chills after 12 years of having it. It is a must for any true metal head.
5,well done metal,"Ride the Lightning is the best album metallica has ever done. I liked this much better than kill em all because it is not mindless rampaging at all. It is very well put together metal.The best track, in my opinion is fight fire with fire because it has nice guitar and i heavy without being mindless. The second best track is fade to black because it has nice guitar and is a slower song. Other good ones are escape and call of ktulu.The worst song on here, i think is trapped under ice. it doesnt flow well and gets on my nerves. all the others are very good. I highly recommend anyone who was even a little turned off by kill em all to try this album because it is not as heavy as people say.have a nice day"
5,The Best!,"This is my favorit Metallica album, ofcourse ""Master of puppets"" is great to and ""...And Justis for all"" isent to bad but this is the best I think, all the tracks are fantastic ultra fast monster epics, Heavy Metal does not get much beter then this, belive me."
5,So Good!,"I think I like this one better than Master Of Puppets! It opens well, with the short classical guitar piece, then goes into what is probably Metallica's fastest song ""Fight Fire With Fire"". ""Ride The Lightning"" is a great song, although not as good as ""Master Of Puppets"" for a title track. Kirk Hammett's guitar playing got alot more creative than it was on Kill'em All, but the Kill'em All solos are still really good. On songs like ""The Call Of The Ktulu"" you can really tell what a great band this is. I think it's a better instrumental than ""Orion"". My favorite song on this cd would have to be ""Fade to Black"", just because it's absolutely perfect. Great ballad with great lyrics and some nice acoustic riffs, then it turns electric and has one of Kirk's best solos ever. Buy this cd if you like Master of Puppets alot, or if you just love metal."
4,1 drawback to this CD: Too Short,"This is a real good CD, although (sorry metallibuddies) ReLoad is better. Eight songs and 46 minuets really are too short for a CD. (Unless the reason for the shortness of this CD is because of the breakup of the band) Metallica should have put more effort into this CD. There is a great part in each of the songs including; the riff at the beginning of Ride, the vocals on Fade, some vocals on Escape, and the crecendo at the end of Ktulu. Other than the length, this CD is another kick @ss CD from Metallica!"
5,The 2nd greatest album Metallica ever made,"This album is too awesome to describe. Their sophomore effort features first Metallica song I remember listening to, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"". I've been hooked ever since. This was Metallica at its best. With songs based on everything from Jaymz's mom's death (""Fade to Black""), to Jewish legend (""Creeping Death""), to capital punishment (""Ride the Lightning""), to an Ernest Hemingway novel (""For Whom the Bell Tolls""), this album boasts a plethera of styles, beats, rhythms, and emotions, this is destined to be remembered as the album that put Metallica on the musical map for good."
4,Keeps 'em all on their toes!!!!,"""Ride the Lightning"" is one of the best albums of the 80's. I personally bought it for ""Fade To Black"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" but it's all really good. It's been a long time since I've heard it, but it's all coming back to me now!!! A must for all fans of Metallica!!!"
4,One damn good cd,"I found that there are no bad songs on this cd. From the soft ""Fade to Black"" to super heavy ""Trapped Under Ice"", this cd has no flaws. It is my third favorite Metallica cd (2nd is Master, 1st is Kill 'Em). The best song on this is easily ""The Call Of Katulu"". It is one of their instrumental songs, and is just a treat to listen to. If it was the only good song on this cd, I'd still love the cd. So go out there and buy it!"
3,hmmm,the lyrics may be good but there's better riffs like led zeppelin's 4th! the vocals are quite bad!
3,It's good not the black album but good.,Good stuff and a few good workout songs so I am happy. For whom the Bell tolls is still one of my favorite songs.
4,Under-rated,"Metallica made it big with ""Master of Puppets"" in 1986. ""Ride the Lightning,"" however, was a very good album that, perhaps, didn't get the exposure is deserved because is was pre-MoP. Even now, ""Fade to Black"" is an all-time Metallica classic. A very solid metal album."
4,Good album,"Fade to Black is my favorite in this album, Ride the lighting and For Whom the Bell Tolls are also great.Although not good as these three I also like the other songs in this album.Definitely a must have."
4,lightning,"This is Metallica's 2nd best album (right beneath Master). The songs are raw as hell and just make for good thrashing. It really showcases how well the band gelled collectively. As seperate musicians, this band is sub par (esp. Hammett and Burton). Anyway, I just remember how kick ass this album was to crank back in high school. It's a shame Metallica evolved into such a state of utter suckness with the more current releases."
4,A good CD,"I'm a big Metallica fan. I have every one of their CDs (including the rare original ""Complete Garage Days,"" which is contained almost entirely on Garage Inc.) This is one of their best. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls,"" ""Fade to Black,"" ""Creeping Death,"" and ""Fight Fire With Fire"" are all very good classic Metallica. For Who the Bell Tolls is my favorite lyric song (I love the lyrics). This album is slightly overrated but still good."
5,one of the best metal,"Metallica's Lightning if often overlooked between Kill and Puppetz. This is STILL a good album that has some fan favorites ""Creeping Death"" and ""Bellz"" as well as some songs by the great Cliff Burton. This album begins the musical maturity for Metallica as songs begin to get longer and more structured preparing for Puppetz and Justice. Also features the epic instrumental - Call of Ktulu"
5,Amazing! Metallica's best,"In my opinion, this is Metallica's best album. It's got an autumnal atmosphere to it, which is reflected in the songs Call of Kutulu, Fade to Black, For Whom the Bell Tolls etc. It's a great album to stick on when it's raining, it's strange but it's just got a rainy day feel to it. Superb. Pretty much all the songs are classics. If you are new to Metallica, get 'the black album' but this is probably my favorite of their earlier, heavier stuff. Sure, Lars Ulrich is Shi-ite on drums (as ever) but the amazing guitaring from Kirk Hammet gloss over it easily. Listen to the end of Fade to Black - mint, he's almost as good as Slash, you can guess I prefer Guns N' Roses to Metallica! But, excellent album."
5,Ride that damn lightning!!!,"This is a phenomenal album. It starts with an acoustic riff and, as usual it breaks out into a monster riff!! Some of Metallica's greatest songs are on this album including the emotional Fade to Black, and the concert favourites - For Whom The Bell Tolls and Creeping Death. The progression is great on this album and is especially shown off on the truly phenomenal 'The Call OF Ktulu' which is one of if not the greatest instrumental I have had the pleasure to hear(the main rival is Orion on Master of Puppets). Simply put- Great musicmanship, great lyrics and great creativity. Get It Now!!!!!"
5,best dang metallica album ever!,"I have to say,with respect to master of puppets,that ride the lightning is,in my opion, the best dang metallica album out. but don't get me wrong, I absolutly love each and every album,from kill em' all to S&M. it's just on R.T.L., metallica's got every thing perfect in order to make it a monumental album. thank you"
3,good but far from best,"this album not as heavy as i thoughtthe 1st and 2nd track are thrashthe 3rd track ""for whom the bell tolls"" are nothing special, is not fast songs and it has no lead guitar too4th track is a power ballad, pretty good5th track is trash again but not as good as the 1st track6th track ""escape"" is one of the most unfamous songs from metallica, and that's really nothing special with this songs, just medicore7th track is the best track on this album. cool riff good lead and drumming8th track is instrumental track , pretty goodoverall this album is good but far from best metal album"
2,Decent,"Why the hell are these guys considerd ""thrash' when their best songs are the slow ones, on here that means Fade to Black. Fight Fire With Fire is ok, For Whom the Bell Tolls is good, nothing much else to say."
2,Over rated to the max....,"Everyone say that Ride The Lightning is Metallica's flawless album and that it was their best. Well, I think that Ride The Lightning is totally over rated, because it has the worst songs that Metallica ever made put into one CD. The only good song that is on this album is Fight Fire With Fire and Ride the Lightning. Everything else is terrible to the max."
2,THEY SOLD OUT HERE!!!!!,"What a MIXED BAG!!!!!!!'FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE''..O yes what an opener!!! that riff is a face melter!!! the lyric's are good as well!!Now the rest..LOL!! um..I dont even need to say what is good and what isnt but..''creepign death'' SUCKZZ!!!! I HATE THAT SONG!! and ''for whom..''..it's ok, NOTHING GREAT!!I think ''escape'' is my fave song on here, it's simple and I like the lyric's!!! ''fade to black''..well the ending is really BEAUTIFUL, but CANDLEMASS will always SLAY this song, CANDLEMASS INFLUENCED this song as well!! also Mustiane was METALLICA I think!!!What a JOKE compared to the AMAZING KILL 'EM ALL!!!!! METALLICA MADE ONE GREAT ALBUM(KILL 'EM ALL) THAT WAS IT!!!And also..ATTETION 13yr old kid's, will you PLEASE look up N.W.O.B.H.M. band's instead of this CRAP..beacuse that is what this was a RIPP OFF of..again N.W.O.B.H.M...google it!!"
3,Decent,"My album must have been a bad press because the sound of every song sounds slowed down a bit, probably because it's a 33 LP. Still pretty good none the less. For under 30 bucks, I can't complain too much."
5,Their best work!!!,"At first I wasn't that big fan of this CD, but i started listening to this CD and I liked most of the songs(except for ESCAPE). Fade to Black was the best but the rest of the songs followed closely. Is a good CD to listen to when puching people or giving the middle finger to the blind"
4,RECORD ARRIVED WARPED,"NEW METALLICA ALBUM WAS PACKED IN A BOX THAT WAS TOO SMALL, ALBUM WAS PUSHED INTO THE BOX AND ARRIVED WARPED. ALBUM ALSO NEEDED CLEANED TO GET ALL THE POPS AND CLICKS OFF THE RECORD. IT TRACKS OK, BUT MY TONEARM RISES AND FALLS WITH THE WARP AND SOME DISTORTION IS AUDIBLE. A HASSLE TO RETURN I FEAR......."
4,"Weakest Metallica album with Cliff, so it only gets four stars","If you're an old-school Metallica fan, it's obvious that this one is a must have.Before they became huge and boring, they used to actually rock. Buy this one if you want to see what the bleeding edge of metal was like back in '84."
5,This CD has hard and soft rock. It's great.check fade2black,"This Cd has it all. Fast beats, slow beats, hard rock, and soft rock. It doesn't get any better."
4,Great Follow-Up,"Ride the Lightning is Metallica second strongest album. This album has some of Metallica's best songs. This is the album for new Metallica fans. My personal recommendations include, ""Ride The Lightning"", ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", ""Fade to Black', and ""Escape"". A must have for Metallica fans."
4,they are all so good,"One of the three best Metallica albums and for me is the best! Its real hard to compare Master, Lightning and Kill'em All because they are all so good. I guess the reason I say this album is better is because of the consistency of killer songs."
4,when metallica was metallica... 4 & half stars,"Metallica released killer thrash metal albums! This album is great with super fast songs and angry vocals. The best song is definitely ""Creeping Death"". That shows what kind of metal Metallica is truly capable of. Other good songs are ""Fight fire with Fire"" and ""Trapped under Ice"". This album makes one remember when Metallica used to make albums that were up to the par of bands like Slayer, Anthrax, Sepultura, and Megadeth and other killer thrash bands. Popularity killed Metallica and made them sell out though. Metallica ""Kill Em All"" through ""Justice for All"" is true Metallica."
5,Speed metal classic!!!,Ride the Lightning is the classic speed metal album! It speaks and grips the mind. Trapped Under Ice makes you feel like dying of both hypothermia and suffucation. You can see the plague spreading across the land in Creeping Death. Fight Fire with Fire is another hard classic.This is metal the way it should be!
5,W-O-W!!,"This was the first CD i ever owned, and while now I own upwards of 50 CDs, this is still my favorite. It was a hard choice deciding between this CD or The Black Album as my favorite album of all time. On The Black Album, I love just about every song except Of Wolf and Man. Nothing Else Matters made it so hard to choose, but it came down to the fact that Fade to Black, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Creeping Death, and the awesomest instrumental of all time, The Call of Ktulu are present on Ride the Lightning. Also, the fact that I do not dislike ANY song at ALL on Ride the Lightning made me come to the decision.. RIDE THE LIGHTNING IS AND ALWAYS WILL THE BEST METALLICA ALBUM, OR ANY ALBUM FOR THAT MATTER OF ALL TIME!!"
1,Blah...,metallica sucks and they always will! I really hate metallica and this album is awfull! The best band in the 80's was sepultura even doe they werent early 80's they still much better then metalica! F*ck metalica!!!
1,I DO NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL!,"I went to a friend's house to take back the copy of limp bizkit 'results may vary' he had borrowed off of me. then his older brother came home with this cd. we listened to it and I didn't like it at all. I mean, I like a feew of mettalica's songs, such s I disappear and enter sandman, but i didnt like this album, not even a little bit. go and buys ome real metal instead."
1,Linkin Park of the '80's,"This is the stupidest Pop band ive ever heard of.""oh yah,there the greatest band on earth"".O......k!I diddnt know that the gratest ""band"" on earth would have subliminle messages like ""SMOKE POT,SMOKE POT, EV'RYBODY SMOKE POT!!!""please,dont listen to this pop crap."
4,Something missing,This is a great album no doubt. The call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song I have ever heard. fade to black is an absolute classic. maybe missing a little balls though in this one.
5,DAMN great metallica will never fade to black,GReat Cd its the 2nd cd theyve made it has great titlesFight fire with fire: very good its about what the title saidsRide the lightning: good songfor whom the bell tolls: its one of my favorites its not badFade to black: MY favorite ive been listening to this song every sence i bought it.......3 YEARS AGO!!!EVerything else vgood but not my favorite
5,"Metallica's 1984,'Ride The Lighthning'.","In 1984 Metallica had just cut their first album, 'Kill Em' All', and now had switch record studios and then cut this album,'Ride The Lightning'. Ride the lightning is a great classic Metallica album For whom the bell tolls is defenentlay the best song on it. Basicly all the songs are great on it so if your new to Metallica this would be one worth buying."
4,The best album of the 80's,Metallica defined the 80's metal sound. When black came outthey started ( ). Ride the Lightning is one of the greatest songsof all time. END
5,One of the best Metallica albums,"I really liked this CD. The best songs are ""Ride the Lightning"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""Trapped Under Ice"", ""Creeping Death"", and ""The Call of the Ktulu"". This is some of the best metal music out there. Much better than N'Sync and other talentless morons spewing up words that they didn't even write, let alone comprehend. Metallica aren't a bunch of posers who can dance; they are cool."
2,New Vinyl Sounds Wretched!,"This is one of the worst sounding LPs I have ever come across. I'm not attacking the album itself, it's still the classic we know and love, but something went horribly wrong with the mastering of this new vinyl edition. It's unlistenable. It sounds muffled and distorted. I am so disappointed. Stick with the vintage LP releases and don't mess with these new pressings."
5,A gem!,"This album is, hands down, one of the best albums ever produced IMHO. Every song has its story and even though they are all different they are all powerful. I fail to see, hear, or feel any weakness in this album; it is a complete work of art. The only other albums that come close to this one are Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and The Beatle's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band; the comparison of this album to these two speaks for itself. A real gem."
5,Ride The Riffs,"The riff masters of the 80's show their brute force on this metal classic. If you love guitar riffs with breakneck speed this album delivers with songs such as, ""Fight Fire With Fire"", ""Ride The Lightning"", ""Trapped Under Ice"" and ""Creeping Death"". Ride The Lightning also establishes Metallica's melodic side (not shown on their debut album Kill 'Em All), displayed in songs such as ""Fade To Black"" and ""Call of Ktulu"". Lyrically this sophomore effort steps up to the challenge with subject matter such as nuclear annihilation, capitol punishment and suicide. The late Cliff Burton delivers with brilliant bass work on Metallica fan favorite ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", and the instrumental ""Call of Ktulu"". If you want to hear Metallica's original sound, before over produced albums such as Load & Re-Load, pick up Ride The Lightning, the seminal metal album of the 80's."
2,"Fantastic album, but do now buy the 2008 vinyl reissue","Ride the Lightning [Vinyl]Metallica Ride the lightning is a fantastic album, by far one of Metallica's best, but buyers beware DO NOT buy the 2008 warner bros. vinyl LP Reissue. sound quality is flat and is INFERIOR to the cd version."
5,Outstanding!,"This album is a complete package of metal. ""Fight Fire With Fire"" is a great speed-metal track. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is very majestic in its sound. ""Creeping Death"" has incredible riffing and a great, fist-pumping chanting part. And ""Fade to Black"" is the best non-cheesy power ballad since ""Stairway to Heaven."" While Load and Re-Load weren't that bad, Ride the Lightning is Metallica's best overall album."
5,Good album,"Metallicas second album and arguably their best. Starting with a short piece of classical guitar changing into the hard thrasing sound of ""fight fire with fire."" The next song ""ride the lightning"" is weak in my opinion though. with not that much musical variety. ""Fade to Black"" is a slower metallica at its best. A good song that is rarely mentioned is ""escape"" with the message of indepdence and individuality from the masses of others. Hetfield sings his best on this. Another intresting song is the 5 minute instrumental ""call of ktulu"" which can give a creepy sense better than most other things."
4,Almost perfect,"Ride the Lightning marks the begining of a somewhat Progressive era in Metallica's career that would last for the next two Albumns. Every song Hits you like a ton of Bricks.James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich came into their own as songwriters on this CD,They went in a diffrent direction without selling out. (they waited a few years to do that)The only thing that keeps me from giving this CD 5 stars is the fact that it only has 8 songs.But Thats the only bad point ...If you like heavy Metal you will love this CD......I do."
5,One of Metallicas finest,"This is the follow up to Metallicas fist album Kill Em All.It is a bit more polished than the first one. I think that this could be their best album but all the 80s Metallica is great. Every song on this album is great. The first track Fight Fire With Fire is a great song and the title track Ride the Lghtning is a 6 minute masterpeice.Kirks solo is a fine one and satisfyingly long. Fade to black is a bit slower and not as much thrash as the other songs it has another great solo and somewhat errieness about the song that makes you love it even more.The next song trapped under ice is a great song that brings out thrash at its finest in Metallica.Escape is a timeless song that is sure to be a favorite and Creeping Death is sheer perfection. THe CAll oF ktulu is an excellent finish to a great album. This 8plus minute instrumental is amazing, how can they write those! in conclusion buy this cd if you are a true Metallica fan you already have it."
4,great metallica,"this is definetly not metallicas best but sure is up top on my list. most songs are great except for escape, and ktulu. buy puppets, then kill, then maybe this one. you will still be amazed at the solos and double bass that lars does."
4,+++ a SHOCKING!!:) great album+++,"Ride the Lightning, MetallicA's 2nd shockwave of heavy metal tunes. I gave this record only 4 stars because of ''Trapped Under Ice, and Escape'' Probabley the weakest songs of their old school era. This one holds several of MetallicA's greatest such as ''For Whom the Bell Tolls,Ride the Lightning,Creeping Death,Fight Fire With Fire, and last but not least, FADE TO BLACK the song that sold the album and brought the others to everyones attention. This is a great cd, just disregard the two i mentioned. Buy this and Kill 'Em All for total 80's bar room metal."
2,"meh.. didnt impress me as much as st anger, but worth a try","eh... simple 80s guitar solos, long hair, leather jackets... how many of these black sabbath rip off bands do we need?metallicas finest album is st anger. black album the debut was okay but i hate the filler solos, solos take up to much precious singing time"
1,I don't see what the big deal is... St Anger was the album that blew me away.,Why is this album highly praised? Was it becuase the movie OLD SCHOOL had it in the background? maybe so.Metallica sucks. The only decent albums they have are load and reload and their masterpiece ST anger. Their first 5 albums are really bad.
1,2 GOOD SONGS BUT STILL 1 STAR.,"I would like to edit my review because this has 2 good songs in For Whom The Bell Tolls, and Fade to Black. I'm not a huge Metallica fan. I just like about 3 of their good albums in Black Album, Master of Puppets, and this Ride the Lightning."
5,Best that Metallica can offer!!,"This is the best Metallica CD out in the market. It has the best song, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"". Also one of the most intense songs, ""Fight Fire with Fire"". I recommend this CD very much."
4,too short,they rock what more to say? if you dislike them then Oh PLease God help you where have you been. lock your self in the psyco ward NOW!
5,The album to start (or end) your thrash collection with,"There is really no need for this review, since I agree with practically all other reviews. In my opinion, this is the greatest thrash album of all time. Every song here is a blast, whereas the very similar (and almost as excellent) Master of puppets have two weak tracks. Go get it."
4,Great record for historians...,"This album presents the 80's heavy metal (as much as Kill 'em All). It is a great album featuring songs written by Dave Mustane, currently on Megadeth. Fast, fast, and.... fast."
5,So let it be written...,"I have been a fan of Metallica for 10 years, and even through their evolution with the LOAD double shot, this album is the top dog with Master Of Puppets trailing just behind it."
5,BEST CD EVER,this is the best cd ever by the best band ever. it includes one of my favorite songs of all time in for whom the bell tolls. great classic thrash here. solid all the way through. pretty amazing considering how young they were when they wrote this stuff.PS rest in peace cliff
3,"This album is a classic, but SHM does not mean ReMastered!","Amazon needs to be real careful here, or lots of folks are gonna be pissed off. The only difference between SHM and the original is the material that the actual physical CD is made of. That's it. They sound identical, at least on my reference system, to the originals issued from the 80's. If you want the actual Remastered version you're still going to have to pony up for the gold discs produced back in the 90's.DJ"
5,"St. Anger, it's not... Thank God for small miracles.","No this isn't St. Anger. This is good. This album shows a young band still hungry and putting their talents to full use. ""St. Anger"" shows an old band desperate to get back its old fanbase. ""Ride The Lightning"" shows the band as the innovators and leaders they were. ""St. Anger"" shows a band willing to jump on a trend to look current. This is where they were true metal not ""Nu metal""."
2,VELCRO?!?!?,"This basket looks so sweet and nice in the picture, but when I pulled it out of the box I couldn't believe that the hood was attached with VELCRO!! I was SOOOOOOO disappointed. I can't believe it doesn't clearly state that in the description and no other reviewer thought to mention it! The velcro completely ruins what would have been an otherwise perfect basket. So, if you don't mind cheap, tacky-looking velcro, then this basket is okay (for the price)."
2,Poorly Made :-(,"I bought one moses basket, and then had to order another one due to a quality defect, and they both ended up getting returned. On the side of the basket, where the handles are located, the basket was either poorly wrapped or wasn't wrapped at all and the sharp basket material stuck out. I was bummed that I had to pay for shipping for both items and then had to return them as well. I really liked the idea of having a removable top piece but I would shop around for other baskets before purchasing this one."
3,Just arrived...it's cute!,We just received this moses basket yesterday. The bedding is a bit different than I expected - the sides are actually an embroidered polkadot with the waffle just on the bottom of the insert. Basic mattress pad. I am planning to make my own bedding from an easy tutorial I found online in addition to what we received.We are planning to use this with the Jolly Jumper stand which has not arrived yet!
3,Nice Moses Basket,Pretty good for the price the quality of the basket its allright the only thing i didnt like about this moses is that the handle doesnt stay up but besides that i like it because is pretty huge and very comfortable for my lil man...the delivery service was excellent thank you amazon!!
2,Pointless for us,I was so excited to get this cute basket. I actually got it for my birthday before my LO was born. I used it once because my daughter loves to be held. When she does need to be put down she prefers something softer and where she can actually look around. This offers no view of anything and it's very floppy. I envisioned myself carting my baby around with it but definitely not.
3,Moses Basket,"I really like the concept of this. The product is really well made. My only problem is that it would work better for me if 1) it was shorter, and 2) if you could carry a child in it. I have a little trouble keeping the hood on, too. But, again, this is a really well made product."
3,Worthwhile purchase,"Not the sturdiest of products, but perfect for a safe place to lay baby down for a little while. Much smaller and cozier than a playpen."
3,Nice,"Ordered this for my son's new baby and it is a nice basket. The only thingI don't like is how the hood fits on but I see why it has to do that. Itjust doesn't look ""finished"" with it being on with velcro. It's a showergift for them, so I hope they like it!"
2,giant stupid tag,"Since it's so inexpensive, I would recommend it to a friend. However, I would warn them that the liner has this giant stupid tag that you need to remove, but when you try to remove it, it will leave a big tear on the liner."
1,Cheap construction!,"I bought this on sale for $29.99 after reading reviews stating that it was much nicer than the other brands available that were flimsy and used Velcro on the hoods. I thought this meant that neither were a problem with this particular basket, but boy was I wrong. The mattress was thrown in the basket crooked and by the time I received it the basket was completely misshapen and unstable even for a doll. The hood attached with Velcro and had been pushed flat inside the basket so it wouldn't even stay on when I attempted to attach it. The entire thing was very cheap and not even worth $10 let alone the $60 it costs at full price. I'm sure I just got a bad apple with the misshapen basket, but that still doesn't make up for the shoddy construction and cheap materials used."
1,Do not buy this,"I registered for this bassinet and the jolly jumper rocker to go with it. Don't do it! The bassinet is not good quality. The wicker is broken in several areas and does not fit in the jolly jumper rocker base well. It fits, but its quite loose and I don't find it safe at all. OVerall I am pretty disappointed with the basket and rocker base."
4,Good Buy,"This basket is a good buy if you are looking for a simple moses basket for everyday use. The price puts this in the affordable category where some of the other moses baskets out there are more of a luxury item with the luxury price tag. You may find baskets with higher quality bedding but this has a really nice looking reversible liner. The reverse of the liner is white with pastel dots. The hood is totally detachable, and uses velcro wich holds pretty tight, though it is the only reason I deducted a star since it is the least attractive feature on the basket and still hardly an eyesore once you put the liner in it. I can not end this without mention of Target's speedy processing of this order - I ordered this late at night on a Tuesday and received it by Friday afternoon. The free shipping they were offering made this a great deal! Not disappointed."
1,Dangerous for a Baby,I washed the bumper part of the basket by hand in cold water and now it does not fit properly. It is way too small and the walls buckle in... this could suffocate my baby... I do not recommend this product at all.
5,One of My Favorite Baby Items!,"This basket is wonderful. Unlike the regular small hard plastic carriers with the hard plastic handles, these are soft and roomy. The typical carrier is too small and the babies diaper cannot be change nor can you bundle them. My stroller didn't make the terrain when I needed it and to and it was not always appropriate to bring into, say, someone's home. The inside is adorable and there is plenty of room to surround your baby with extra blankets/cushions, shield her from the wind and give her a roomy more relaxed place to 'grow'. I recommend it hands down over the small hard plastic portable carriers or strollers, it's perfect for most every outing we go on."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed by what I thought was flimsy construction when I received this basket. The bedding didn't fit properly, the sides of the basket were kind of flopping over, the handles hung into the basket and would always be in the way. It just didn't seem sturdy enough. The weaving joined right at the top rim of the basket and looked like it was coming apart. I couldn't picture carrying my baby in it. My husband's first comment when he took it out of the box was, ""Looks like it's worth about $40."" I returned the item. I bought a hoohobbers basket and loved it - worth the extra money."
5,The devil to pay!,"Who hasn't wanted to be a pirate? Even better, how would you like to be a dashing corsair in a world where dragons are as real as doubloons? If your idea of swashbuckling adventure includes swinging leaps through the rigging of a flaming warship, sparking blades singing over spilled rum and screaming prisoners, broadsides of flame, ice, acid, and worse, and wondrous islands filled with dark mystery and magical danger, you will love this supplement! Features include details on the piratical life and their vengeful code of honor, creating pirate characters, the infamous Pirate Isles, a Rogue's Gallery of notorious ne'er-do-wells, the tall ships of the Sea of Fallen Stars, movement and combat at sea, an adventure, a great slice of pirate speak, and more! Sails high..."
4,All Aboard,"This 128 page sourcebook features a good mix of information to create adventures (or perhaps a campaign) based on the Seas of the Fallen Stars. It would be a good sourcebook, for either a newbie to D&D, or even an expert. It includes new spells, new kits, recommendation of Non-Weapon Proficiencies, magical items, description of the area around the Inner Sea, and other areas, NPCs, an adventure, Ship descriptions, and new rules. What more could one ask for?If you want to buy this book for ship description only, then I'd recommend 'Of Ships and the Sea' instead. But if you want a sourcebook that gives information enough to create a campaign, then this isn't a bad sourcebook at all! But of course, you should enjoy adventures on the sea, that's where the true fun in this product lies!"
5,"""5 out of 5, baby""","If you give this cd a chance you'll love the Doors just how I did.When I first heard ""Light my Fire"" it blew me away and now I'm hooked.Trust me and listen to a Doors song and i'll guarantee you wont get out alive.Truelly amazing songs each and everyone uniquely done, made to get you on the biggest trip.The Doors are the biggest band ever, they toppled the Beatles and more! They say Eddie Vedar invented stage jumping Jim was stage jumping while Eddie was still swimming around in his Dads nutsacks. So listen to The Doors and be hypnotised.""oh to all the Doors fans, Jim aint dead, hes living in a bungalow at ""the mount"" ...""until the end""..."
2,not a true best of the Doors!,"I am a huge fan of the Doors. Jim Morrison was a wonderful poet and songwriter, if not the nicest guy in the world. Yes, its true. these songs are all GREAT songs, but I can only recommend this CD to those who could care less about any of their songs but the ones you hear on the radio. And in fact if you are that type of person, I recommend you stay away from the Doors altogether and find yourself a nice commercial band from the 60's, like the Beach Boys or something. I had this CD for about a month before I got real, bought their albums, and then gave this one away. Start with the Doors' first album, then Strange Days, and L.A. Woman. If you really like the Doors you will not be disappointed by these three."
1,terrible mix,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who point out the poor mix on this compilation. The vocals are both low in volume and rather muddled. Compare it toThe Best Of The Doors(apparently out of print due to all these reissues, but many available used), which is much brighter and clearer, with Morrison's voice being front and center. We're not talking about audiophile-level discrimination, you only have to listen to Amazon's samples to hear a huge difference. I'm especially surprised at the number of people who say they're longtime fans and liked this mix, because even if you've only heard the songs on the radio they clearly lack the ""Doors sound"" on this album."
4,"Best Of, not ""All Of""","This is the best overview of the Doors (see tracklist) I could find on Amazon. Sadly, it includes the ""She get..., She get..."" edit of ""Break on Through,"" and if I could add one song, it would be ""Peace Frog,"" perhaps.I would encourage buyers to add to their collection some of the less-mainstream songs by the Doors. A more complete ""best of"" is ""Legacy,"" which includes maybe 20+ songs, but seems to be unavailible. (the tracklist may be online)"
4,Great album!,Great sound quality and all my favorites are on it! Definitely a great starter tool for any beginning Doors fan!
5,All you need...,"The first song I ever heard (of the doors) was &#65533;Light My Fire&#65533; and it was from this album. My dad made me listen to it when I was about 14. I loved it. I kept listening to it over and over. I then decided to explore the rest of the CD. OH MAN! &#65533;The End&#65533; blew me away. I knew that these guys where &#65533;for real&#65533;. The Music generated from their songs where out of this world. This album, if you are new to the doors, is the ULTIMATE rock album you will ever need. Most of the Doors finest songs are on this album, like my all time favorite &#65533;Waiting For The Sun&#65533;. In my book, this is all you need to make it trough life... ..."
5,Wow......,"This album is wonderful. With a great price and mind blowing songs how can you pass this up? The music all fits together, almost magically, and this creates a world of escape in this age of rushing around and hurrying. The lyrics are pure genius. The songwriting is genius as well. The only bad thing about this band is the tragic end they had to face and the music they never got to make. Before buying this I was only familiar with the songs one would generally hear on the radio. I saw this and had to buy it. The songs that aren't regulars on the radio are just as good, if not better, than the ones that many know and love. Any fan of any branch of rock music will always go back to bands like The Doors because they helped pave the way into the rock music that is here today. This band will go down in the history of music just like your Bach, Mozart, etc. This is totally worth it, so buy it now!!!"
5,One of the greatest compilations ever,"The best of the Doors is one of the best compilation albums I own.Each and every song is a well crafted masterpiece.This terrific compilation contains classics like BREAK ON THROUGH,LA WOMAN,LIGHT MY FIRE,THE CRYSTAL SHIP and ROADHOUSE BLUES.dont miss out on this one masterpiece.Hugely and strongly recommended."
5,THIS CD BREAKS ON THROUGH !,THIS DOUBLE CD HAS ALMOST EVERY SONG THAT IS GOOD. THERE ARE A FEW SONGS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDED BUT STILL A 5 STAR RATING WITHOUT A DOUBT .
2,Not what I remember!,"I'm in agreement with some of the reviews that mention that the ""remixing"" of these tracks has left Jim Morrison's vocals buried by the instrument tracks. In my opinion,Jim's voice was what made these songs and I'm truly disappointed in this CD. I listened to a few tracks and decided this disc could remain on the shelf while I look into purchasing the versions I loved."
2,The Best of The Doors,"Worth a listen as a decent pop album, but the Doors must surely be credited with being the most overrated band of all time. One wonders if they would have retained their popularity if Jim Morrisson had become bald, old and fat with his contempories. Nothing creates a 'legend' like a death at the peak of poularity, just look at James Dean, Marilyn Monroe etc. Now don't get me wrong every self-respecting rock fan should have a Doors album but how long are the remaining Doors going to bleed this thing for? I see they have now released 'The Very Best of The Doors' to follow up on 'The Best of The Doors'. Oooh ! Let's hope we soon have 'The Very, Very best of the Doors'. Keep on milking it boys."
2,Skip this one,"The music on this CD is great, but the selection is very disjointed. If you're looking for an intro to the Doors, pick up the single CD Greatest Hits. Then, once you're into the ""trip,"" sell it and start buying their albums!(hint: stay away from An American Prayer, get the bootleg of Jim reading his poetry if you can) Trust your old pal Johnny Crackhead on this."
2,"It's all right, but buy the single CD compilation","I saw this one at a CD store for 18 bucks used, so I had to buy it simply because I felt I needed to get some Doors. Poor choice. I could have bought the single-CD greatest hits for a few bucks less and wouldn't have had to sit through the filler to get to the good stuff. I think this CD is good for those that love music that's very alternative and tripped out. What I mean by this is that there are a lot of creative lyrics and musical styles in the set, but I found it to be very mediocre and tiresome. So, basically what I'm trying to say is find someone with some Doors and if you find that you LOVE it, buy this and you'll have a great bunch of tunes, but if you find that it doesn't really do much for you, buy the single-CD greatest hits. You'll be much happier and have the essentials. They did make some great music- but two CDs are too much for my taste."
3,"Good starter, I suppose","I ususally don't go in for greatest hits albums (Hot Rocks and Meaty, Beaty, Big & Bouncy are the exceptions). But I suppose they serve a purpose which is to introduce folks who are not familiar with the music so that they'll go out and buy the regular albums. I don't own this one nor plan to own it but I know all the songs on if from the original records. I would concur that it is the best of The Doors but to appreciate them, get the original albums. Of course, on some of those, you'll have to sit through the filler.I also think that Jim Morrison was a flake and overrated. But that is a different matter."
1,Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine,"The Doors are my favorite band, but there is no compilation that comes close to ""Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine"". A double album from the mid seventies that never got released on CD. That was my introduction to the Doors and when it came time to switch to CD, I got this in order to save money. But it didn't satisfy. The Doors had some great singles but that's just the frosting on the cake. You really have to hear everything they did to appreciate the Doors. Now I own just about everything by the Doors on CD including American Prayer, the studio albums, their box set and the two albums without Morrison(I still don't have ""You need Meat"" however). When it comes to making a compilation to listen to in my car, what I put together is very close to ""Weird Scenes"". With some additions and omissions. Looking at all the repackaging of the Doors music, nothing comes close to ""Weird Scenes"". Skip a Doors greatest hits and get all the regular albums instead."
1,Jim Morrison ....buried again...by Bruce Botnick,I am wondering who let John Densmore mix these tracks? Morrison's vocals are almost left off...they are so reduced in this new mix...just horrible..and the drums are now the lead instrument...just awful. A wonderful selection of tracks...reMASTERING would be great but reMixed? WHY? and if so..why didn't anybody mention that Jim's voice was the defining instrument of the band...when he died...so did the band. Don't get me wrong I admire Robby and Ray...but without Jim they didn't go anywhere and why he is diminished in these new mixes is just a crime.
5,Enter The Mind Of Morrison,"Do i have to say more?...... Jim Morrison is one of a kind musical genuis what he has accomplished will forever be remembered in rock n roll, since of his death of believed to be heart failure Morrisons lyrics have been living on and i believe Morrison would be proud to know that his lyrics are still alive....if you want a Really Great Rock Band look no further because after reading this review click yes it was helpful and buy this Masterpiece travel Through The DOORS!!!!"
5,Hola que tal,"Creo que toda recopilación o los discos que The Doors realizaron en su día son una verdadera joya que ninguna generación futura debería perderse. Desde que tenía 14 años soy un fan incondicional de The Doors, pero creo que el grupo está un poco infravalorado por la figura de Jim. Pese a todo me encantan, son geniales. From Spain to all The Doors fans. ""Light my fire baby"""
5,Great Doors selection,"The Doors don't get any better than this. If you like The Doors at all, this is for you. They are so unique and there will probably never be anything like them again."
5,A must for Doors fans.,"This is a good investment for the very best of the Doors(hence the title). Morrison's poetic lyrics come out in some songs and the accompanying music works well. The most popular hits cover the album such as ""Break On Through"", ""Touch Me"", ""LA Woman"", and many others. The full extent of the Doors is nicely arranged and I recommend it as a basic Door's necessity."
5,This is just the tip of the iceberg. . .,"A nice selection of well-known classics. However, to get the full effect of the Doors, you need to listen to some of the live performances, to experience the improvisational and theatrical aspects of the band. I would definatly suggest the new 4-CD boxed set, as it includes mostly live material, plus some of the tracks include a glimpse into Jim's very unique sense of humor (hint: ""Mental Floss"" on disc 3). Definitely essential to the Doors fanatic's collection."
5,The Best band ever,I'm a 23 years old guy and i never thought that i will like this old band..THE DOORS are the best band ever..and no matter all the time ..!!THE DOORS ARE STILL OPEN!!
3,Best of the Doors? they left a few out...,"By giving this three stars, I'm not saying I don't like the Doors, who are in fact my favorite band. All the songs on here are excellent, but they left a lot of songs out! If I could add five songs, I probably would add Peace Frog, the Soft Parade, Moonlight Drive, the Spy, and My Eyes Have Seen You...but there are still others that should be on there! However, if you're new to the Doors this is probably a good place to start...it has almost all their epics as well as top 40 stuff."
5,a must buy,i am only a twelve year old boy i LOVE oldies especially the DOORS i think they rock and i think that robby krieger is the best guitar player there is so if you want some great music get the best of DOORS
5,Jim Morison is The ****!,"Jim Morison has got to be the greatest man ever, he was a rebell, didn't give a care, he was the Man without a doubt... I think if their were more bands like The Doors than music would be more than just words, he sang with full heart and soul, he just let words flow with meaning and deep thought..."
2,"For your own good, please don't buy this!","This two disc set just barely brushes the surface of what the Doors have to offer. Here are some awesome, essential Doors songs you'll be missing out on, just to name a few:Soul Kitchen, from The DoorsTwentieth Century Fox, from The DoorsBack Door Man, from The DoorsEnd Of The Night, from The DoorsTake It As It Comes, from The DoorsYou're Lost Little Girl, from Strange DaysMoonlight Drive, from Strange DaysMy Eyes Have Seen You, from Strange DaysI Can't See Your Face In My Mind, from Strange DaysLove Street, from Waiting for the SunNot To Touch The Earth, from Waiting for the SunYes The River Knows, from Waiting for the SunShaman's Blues, from The Soft ParadeWild Child, from The Soft ParadeWishful Sinful, from The Soft ParadeThe Soft Parade, from The Soft ParadePeace Frog, from Morrison HotelThe Spy, from Morrison HotelMaggie M'Gill, from Morrison HotelThe Changeling, from LA WomanThe WASP (Texas Radio And The Big Beat), from LA Woman"
1,I hate 'the doors',"I always thought 'the doors' were a joke at the time, The fact that now twenty years on some sad nostalgic people are somehow convinced the doors were a serious band is pretty confusing.As demonstrated on this disc 'the doors' were not musicians, they could't play music, they were and still are a joke, and anyone who says they were a proper band is seriously mistaken,They were just poor, At the time no one rated them, somehow in the last 20 years they've bizzarely managed to get some sort of critical acclaim.The fact they are 20 years old doesn't change anything, they sounded poor 20 years ago ,they still sound poor now."
1,dont dig too deep,"Jim Morrison is overrated, plain and simple. other people who reviewed this cd try to say that morrison was a musical genius who spoke with heart and soul, when in fact he didnt even know what he was talking about because he was probably drunk when he wrote 90% of his songs. ill admit they had some good songs, but dont say that morrison is a poet because hes not."
1,I really loathe the Doors...,"I grew up in the Midwest in the 1970s and '80s and I heard a lot of this junk growing up, both from musical mentors and on ""classic rock"" radio and I am SO HEARTILY SICK OF JIM MORRISON AND THE DOORS. The guy was such a total weenie. Since when is getting so drunk that you fall of the stage a great moral virtue? And what a preening, self-centered gasbag!Of all the great hippie-era 'Sixties bands, the Doors are perhaps the least deserving of their legendary status... They had a couple of volcanic, primal early hits but the Doors catalog as a whole is so boring and bloated. Skip ahead to 1976 and crank up the Ramones: now *that's* real rock rebellion! (Axton)"
2,when will it end ?,"the doors had no hits,only filler.i can't wait for the day when somebody wakes up and realizes that only jim morrison knew what he was talking about.third rate psychedelia and third rate musicians. robbie krieger was the only talent in this band and he had to be overshadowed by a drunken street-corner philosopher.i can't understand why kids of today are attracted to this nonsense.i give this two stars for the work of robbie krieger.i would give it 5 if he were the only member of the band. a band that has written actual songs and had their sound stolen by the doors is the MUSIC MACHINE.they appeared before the doors did and if you do really like the doors you might want to check out the MUSIC MACHINE."
2,way overrated,this band was truly overrated.aside from songs like L.A woman&Light my fire what was so special about this group? the lead singer with personna but that's all.Jim Morrison was the 60's version of 2Pac a talented poet but not a great artist.but alot of personna that helped create the Myth&the Man.the music was lacking any real feeling and bottom line was just bad.a very overrated group if ever there was one.
2,"IF you want The Doors, then buy this album","What's the big deal about this band? Good - they made some pretty controversial stuff (for their present). And I see them inspired by a lot of different styles. But I wonder if THEY inspired a lot of bands later on?Listening to The Doors, you sometimes think of Engelbert Humperdinck, sometimes of Country, sometimes of Spanish folk... sometimes of the more psychedelic sides of Led Zeppelin. It has a pretty great deal of variation.And to be fair, the best songs of The Doors - like the eternal Light My Fire or my personal favourite Waiting For The Sun - ARE classics. But apart from this, The Doors do not have that much excitement to offer.This compilation should have been kept down to one CD, not a double-CD.But IF you really want to buy ONE The Doors album, then The Best Of The Doors is the right choice."
2,Jim morrison was a show stealer and a poet,"and he should've stayed a bloody poet. i mean usually poetry and music mix, but not in this case. it's good poetry and bad music. i can't believe how bad some of this sounds. I give it 2 stars because of the cool musicians (not poets) in the band."
1,scrashed,"the doors ,pinkfloyd and piewrmoods were scrashed not the hole disc but some songs thangs for you time to reed this."
5,Excellent Compilation,"As a true fan of The Doors and other classic rock and 'acid rock' music, I was very pleased with the songs chosen to represent The Doors' music in their best hits album. If you are a new fan, this is your best place to start to get a great sample of what The Doors were about (but remember to add more albums later!). This is also an essential album for anyone that is a fan or collector of this genre of music."
5,"This is one of the greatest ""Greatest Hits"" records!","Though The Doors had many great songs and a true hits record of theirs would contain about ten CDs, this is the best anyone could possibly do for two discs. From the strong opening of Break On Through to the end of The End, this record gives us all a great way to remember The Doors. Plus, there's an interesting blurb written on the inside of the cover."
5,THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST!,JIM MORRISON PERFORMED GRRRRREAT AS DID THE OTHER 3 MEMBERS. I HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR MORRISON. I HAVE A ROOM DEDICATED TO HIM AND I OWN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ALBUM BY THE DOORS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS PARTICULAR ALBUM IS THE BEST BY FAR. GREAT MUSIC... ITS BASICALLY ALL THE HITS IN ONE. ID SUGGEST(IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GOOD ALBUM) TO PURCHASE THIS ONE.
5,"Great Band, Great Music","I first heard this music several years ago (hence I decided to write a kid's review) but the music really is great. I love a lot of 60's and early 70's bands until disco came along (thank god I was not alive to protest it!!! uggghhh....) Anyway the doors have wonderful rhythms and lyrics and it just fun music to listen to, unlike everything out there nowadays. I also recommend the rolling stones, simon & garfunkel, U2, and eric clapton (also credited as cream ) Great music, enjoy!"
3,Great material rendered badly,I agree wholeheartedly with all the reviews that praise the content of this recording but i have to say that the audio quality is second rate which makes it rather difficult to listen to. when they remastered it the digital seems to have put emphasis on protions of the instrumentation that were never there in the original recordings.
1,Don't Buy This,"In the 1980's the Doors' music was released on CD later than music from other groups. The first release available was this collection from 1985, which also came out on LP (the Doors individual studio albums, of which there were only six, were not issued on CD in 1987). However, with the summer 2003 release of the Doors' ""Legacy"", this collection is unnecessary and should be out of print. I will say that the song selection on ""Very Best Of"" is good. But the Doors only recorded 64 studio songs (including 2 non-LP B-sides), and while 19 of them are on ""Very Best Of"", 34 tracks (including a live track and an unreleased studio track) are on ""Legacy"", which represents 50 percent of the groups studio output. The sound on ""Legacy"" is also superior. Finally, my one objection in terms of song selection is that neither ""Legacy"" nor ""Very Best Of"" contain the track ""The Soft Parade."""
4,Good for children and toddlers,"Really enjoyed this Go Diego Go DVD. Would recommend, great educational value for children."
5,A credit to Texas,For folks that have a hard time with Michael Moore's dubious attention to details but appreciate his larger intention look no further. Ivins and DuBose use detailed facts and personal stories to show how radical and corrupt this administration is.It make you misty for the days when all pols lied about was adultery.
3,Nothing New.,"Quite honestly, this tales of this book didn't surprise me in the least. George Dubya is sneaky crook who somehow became president. He may have friends in high places and he may have Poppy Bush to bail him out.. but nothing lasts forever. This book just tells what we already know. Bush is a crook. He's a liar, one hundred times over. He's not out to help the little guy, but rather step on his back while Bush attempts climbs higher. Luckily, Dubya's days as the pres' are numbered."
5,revelations,"I have had trouble putting the book down, it is so informative.molly ivans reveals the real G W Bush she has been following for years in texas and beyond. Her sense of humour helps lighten up the behind the spin story of dubya and his frightening neo cons.If things happening around GWB never seemed to make any sense to you, then this book will fill in all those missing pieces.I sure hope there is no second term."
1,Amazingly WRONG,"Books like this completely amaze me as they seek only to fuel peoples hatred. It's quite clear Ivins goal is to be among the elite crowd of Bush-haters by pointing out idividual cases of Americans misfortunes as oposed to the state of the entire nation. Once again proving that anything bad for the people of America is good for democrats and liberals. When I read rubish like this it only helps me embrace conservatism more. One question, answer it honestly to yourself, When you vote will it be out of hatred or genuine trust in the other guy ?"
5,The best President money can buy-,"This book explains- Why Bushes ties to Harken and Enron matter.- How stacking the nations courts with right-wing judges is harmful to democracy.- Why and how the Bush Administration's ""No Child Left Behind"" has left millions of kids behind.- How Bush's poor foreign policy prior to Sept. 11th has negatively affected our ability to fight terrorism."
5,Fair and balanced...,"Message of this book in a nutshell: Capitalism is good -- it's unregulated capitalism that you have to be careful of. If your beliefs hold that government should be there for the benefit of people then you will probably love this book. If your beliefs hold that government should be there for the benefit of big ""bidness"" then you might want to skip this one and devote the time it would've taken to read it to watching FOX News instead."
4,Cronyism and Greed at its worse,"BUSHWHACKED gives the kind of indepth analysis of the Bush Administration which so many journalists today are fearful of doing. This book provides the details of the cronyism, deception and greed which pervades the Bush administration. It shows their disregard for the law and the most basic principles of this democracy. As bad as this administration is, not all the blame for the condition of this nation can be laid at their feet. If we have a president who is not only incompetent, but downright corrupt, it is because a majority of those who voted felt a communion with this man. Any student of history must be agonizing over what is occurring in America. It is horrifyingly similar to the German Weimar Republic and to the Roman Republic before their collapse into dictatorship."
1,Do not waste your money,"This book is a feeble attempt to slam a politician. There's nothing constructive here, just liberal whinning."
1,Ivinswhacked,"Ivins is an idealogue who despises all conservatives and Republicans; her problem is not with Bush but rather with anyone who isn't liberal. The book makes this quite apparent. The book contains many half-truths to support her disdain for Bush. If Bush successfully helped bring about world peace, Ivins would lambast Bush for doing so, saying that Bush created world peace merely for political reasons. Remember that Kerry and Bill Clinton have stated publicly and unequivocally that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and needed to be stopped at all costs. Ivins conveniently refuses to mention this fact in her politically skewed diatribe. Anyone could write a book saying similar things about the Clintons and Kerry. This book is no different from Ann Coulter's--only on the other side of the political spectrum. There's little concern for fairness and journalistic integrity in Ivins' book."
1,Wow... does anyone believe this stuff?,"I was interested in buying this book and read the above editorial review. I was shocked to see that they make the claim that Bush is the only president in history who cut taxes and waged a war at the same time. JFK cut taxes and fought the Vietnam War... You figure that a Democratic writer would remember JFK.I borrowed this book from a friend instead of buying it, and I'm glad I did. It was a waste of time, but at least it wasn't a waste of money. While she has some truth in her book, there is also quite a few lies/misconceptions/half-truths. I found myself dedicating more time to researching her claims then I did reading her book.I don't particularly like Bush and I am eager to see what motivates him, but why would I waste my time trying to seperate fact from fiction reading this book?"
1,Don't have anything against liberals,"Liberals are necessary in our country, just like conservatives are necessary also. The pendulum just keeps swinging back and forth. I just did not like the book. I do get really tired of the political bashing on both sides. Doesn't matter who runs it, this country is still the greatest in the world! Bush inherited NAFTA, entered within a year of the worst terrorism of our nation, dotcoms tanking, Enron scandal~ you got to give the guy some credit~it has been no picnic. It will be interesting to see who wins next year."
1,Not surprised by Molly's book,...Molly writes about Bush with a clearly slanted point of view. Her book proves that Bush is on the right track if someone can make such outlandish [and incorrect] statements that people will pay to read. After reading her book I had to ask myself who is she really talking about...is it true that anyone can write a book and say anything without fact and people will spend their hard earned money to read it. It was like reading the National Enquire. (Which I don't read- but I do see the covers at the supermarket
3,texture book for the very young,"This interactive book has four two-page spreads, each with a poem of two or four lines that describes a character from the 'Monsters, Inc.' animated film, and each with a different texture or visual: 'Boo' has a silken cloth, 'Mike' is hidden beneath a velveteen curtain, 'Roz' leaves a sticky trail, 'Sulley' shows a tuft of soft blue fur, and the final page asks -- ""Now the monsters' game is done, Who's the winner? You're the one!"" with a mirror on the facing page.For the infant to two-year old."
4,Wishbone Ash - 'BBC Radio One Live' (Griffin),"'BBC Radio One Live' is an eight tune set that was recorded at the Paris Theater on May 25, 1972. During the band's heyday, no doubt. Wishbone Ash has always been noted for their top notch use of their 'double lead guitar' sound. Heck, I think Wishbone may've even invented it. Founding members vocalists / guitarists Andy Powell and Ted Turner really shine through out this seventy-minute performance. I couldn't get enough of the opening track ""Blowing Free"" and the twenty-minute encore ""Phoenix"". Wanted to mention that ""Jailbait"" and ""The King Will Come"" also hold up quite well. Great classic '70's rock to enjoy. I had seen the band awhile back open for Nazareth and Uriah Heep and they can STILL pump it out. A good disc to own a copy of."
4,"Good quality candy, but large ones are still my favorite","These little guys are the same high quality as the larger green ones, but the variety of fruit flavors and size make enjoying these a might less fun."
1,The worst Haribo product I've ever tried...,These are very tough and chewy and not very flavorful. Very little fruit flavor. Just kind of generically sweet. Bleh. Not up to Haribo's usual high standards!
3,"excellent music, absurd lyrics","I've got hold of the CD yesterday, i was really thrown with the music, i'm sorry, the lyrics just don't make sense to me, maybe not for the 1st, or the 2nd songs, i've heard bands with great lyrics, and ideas, very intellect bands, i can't really believe that some people gave it 5/5, what were they thinking??"
2,Not good....again.,"Devin is getting a little better in the fact that his albums are not morse code and stupid sounds wasting fans money. This album is back to actual music, just not good music. Step at a time...."
5,music evolved,"Simply great, like any of the Devin Townsend solo albums.This is the first from the devin townsend band, so you can hear the freshness and enthusiasm from all the band members.Great compositions, great riffs, great ambience, great lyrics, and the most important, great display of emotions."
2,Knifeman,"Overwrought vocals bring this would-be-impressive radio ready hard rocker a little lower, making an only ok thing even worse, with a few helpful surprises of unpretentious energy along the way."
2,Below expectations,"When I purchased the movie, I expected to see stunning photographs of many abandoned industrial sites with some info and history for each location. When I watched the movie, I was disappointed that most of the featured places are not named and no information is provided about them. A lot of narration is simply boring.Although, the bonus movie ""A symphony of industry"" is very interesting, it describes the process of steel production and fabrication.I guess, ""Echoes of forgotten places"" is ok to watch once, as long as you don't have unrealistically high expectations about it."
1,It is no good.,"The Electrovaya PowerPads ""Puff Up"" and become very ugly and dangerous looking. Here is a quote from the director of sales: ""...the battery can over-discharge and the cells can be damaged. In some cases when a stored PowerPad was later charged it puffed. The puffing was actually a good thing in that this is how the battery was designed."" Electrovaya has now reduced the length of their warranty to 6 months because they no longer like to support their PowerPads. I have seen this happen to 70% of PowerPads within 1 year of use. I would not recommend this product in any way!"
5,Should Be Turned Into A Movie,"I liked This book.It is a romance book from I think Harlequin and it is also a mystery and suspence story.The hero and heroine and the kid and the heroes brother are good characters and there is one guy who is a major baddie and is really very creepy and scary but I still like the book and recommend it!I wish this book would be turned into a movie, I would watch it for sure!"
1,Not as pictured!!,"Contrary to the product description, there are no cedar panel inserts to provide support. These are floppy bags with no rigidity whatsoever."
5,Wonderful!!,"I bought this Dutch oven to use with the recipes in ""Glorious One-Pot Meals"". The pot is absolutely wonderful and I use it often!"
1,Numbers Don't Match,"The suckerstick lollipop sticks don't match the description. There were only 35 sticks in the pkg that was received. Upon emailing the manufacturer, another pkg was forthcoming, but someone needs to change the count to match the actual package."
2,A Painter's Kietchen- Revised Edition,The book was disappointing. I thought that there would be more information about Georgio O'Keefee and that the receipes would be more interesting.
2,"A Decent Translation, but a Poor Edition","My experience with Tacitus in the original was brief and without professorial guidance, so I can't vouch for the accuracy of the translators; however, Church and Bodribb's English is certainly readable if a bit outdated (A trait I like in translations of ancient authors). The lack of footnotes or maps is what dooms this edition, though it probably is directly related to the excellent price. I would only advise purchasing this book if money is that much of a problem for you or if you're only buying as an aid for translation, you dirty cheat you."
4,Heavy introduction to Roman politics and warfare,"I have just started reading Tacitus, but I want to respond and thereby get rid of your question.As stated in the introduction, Tacitus is very difficult to translate. This is also obvious from the text. Frequently two interpretations are possible.However, the content is well worth reading. You get pretty close to the personalities with their often disagreeable traits. The text reminds me of Herodotus in often starting a discussion, implicitly with the reader.I look forward to reading the full book. Given the rather heavy substance, I have interrupted it temporarily for ""Down the Nile""."
4,Good book,Good book. I love books that have a positive story line that involve children. I would recommend the book. It tugs at the heart strings.
4,Their Little Princess by Susan Mallery,"I absolutely like ""series"" books that continue on with the story of a family. This book has it all and makes you want to read more about the characters."
5,A Beautiful Fine Arts Photography Book,Using the pregnant female body as a study of light and form Catherine Steinmann's artful interpretation of this subject rivals the work of the best classic photographers. The publishers of this book used every available means to present the finest quality book available on the market. This is an amazing production! Printed by one of the foremost Italian printing companies. This book is an example of the finest tritone printing available. If you love collecting high quality artbooks put this on your list.
5,A Very Well Docemented Book That Is Clear And Easy To Unders,"I did the CIPT training course hoping that it would be enough to pass the exam. Although the instructor was excellent, the documentation was not. It did not couther certain topics in detail, and was hard to follow. As I had to pass the exam for myself and so that the company kept its Cisco Partner Status I had to get some good documentation.Although I am only half was through this book I am finding it excellent. It goes into good detail on the information, which you have to know, whilst not sending you to sleep on information, which is not relevant to call manager, networking, or telephony. I am confident that once I have read the book a few times I should be able to pass the exam without too much trouble. Cannot say this about the Cisco training documentation."
5,A Comprehensive Overview From the Development Team,"This book provides a great reference to Cisco CallManager! Written by the development team that actually created the software, it gives accurate and incisive information that isn't always easy to find in the Cisco documentation. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is going to purchase, install, or maintain a CallManager system."
5,Excellent Book!,"There is no more authoritative book on the market on Cisco CallManager. This book answered questions for me that I couldn't find anywhere else. In particular, the dial plan chapters unravel the difficulty of complex route plans and helped me to understand each component of the dial plan process. I reach for this book frequently as I administer my CallManager systems!"
1,I HAVE NOT GOTTEN THIS BOOK,I purchased this book on Sept. 26th and have not received it yet. Today's date is Oct. 27th. I feel that a month is more than enough time to mail it and am extremely disappointed that it has not come. I will probably not do business with Amazon again. Alison
5,APOCADELIC!!!1,"This is a really good album from the lads! It includes all their singles including their new song ""What About Us"" The best songs on the album are Say Yeah, What About Us, Baby I Don't Care and Freaky Time (unplugged)! i would recommend this album as it has really wicked songs that those cute guys wrote!!! And you get to hear Brett singing on Say Yeah! GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!!!!"
3,Ok,A large flathead screw driver in the hands of an experienced tire changer is more useful than these. They are too wide when working with really tight tires.
3,Technically a good resource,"My review of this book is a little mixed. I think that technically the book is quite good. I have always been extremely pleased with Ben Forta's writing and clear approach to the subject matter. There were two things I did not like about the book. First, I purchased this book when it first hit the shelves and it was expensive, for a technical book. Second, I found numerous typos, incorrect references to figures, and other text errors. I am a stickler for these things and it is distracting to me when I find simple errors in a book. Overall, I really do think that the technical aspects of the book are good and it is a great resource that I use frequently. If minor typos and the such bother you, check to see if there is new edition, otherwise, this is a great resource for learning WAP and WML.PS: Be forewarned, my reviews are not checked for spelling or grammar...I don't have an editor fix them for me. SORRY!"
2,Disappointing,"Mainly, I bought this album on the strength of Blue is the Colour, which was a great album, with one of the best kick-off songs of all time in 'Don't Marry Her.' This music, on the other hand, is bland, banal, and boring; utterly unconvincing. I doubt it would even help if I was British; These love songs just don't transfer well through the ear or to the heart. Buy it for your mother who's home alone all day, though, and it just might be your good deed for the month."
3,"Paul Heaton, if you're reading this...",Time to ditch the BS and embark on your long-awaited solo career. All we need is your ethereal voice and your brilliant lyrics. Period.
2,The worst album of TBS,"I bought all the collection of TBS, so I hope my opinion would help you. For me, Painting It Red is the worst album of all. Only the track number 10 and 12 are really good. The rest of the songs are realy poor. Another albums of TBS like ""Miaow"" or ""Choke"" are really better."
4,Solid Beautiful South,"If you're a fan of The Beautiful South, you will like this cd. It is a solid set of songs that grows on you with each listening. The songs ""Tupperware Queen,"" ""Final Spark,"" ""10,000 Feet,"" ""Masculine Eclipse,"" and ""The Mediteranean"" are my favorite tracks from this cd. This cd doesn't seem to have the obvious hits jumping out of it like some of TBS's past albums, but I think this cd also shows the band's maturity better. I just saw the band at the House of Blues in L.A. last Saturday (10/28/00), and they are as great as ever. I love this band!"
3,Not their best by a long way,"What a shame. I got the limited edition as soon as I could get my hands on it, as a big B. South fan, but... It's not exactly a bad album, but it is not what I expected after the excellent Quench. Actually boring at times, this sounds like they couldn't be bothered to choose their best songs for a normal album, but just released everything theyhad onto a double.Some good moments, but I hope this is not the beginning of a downhill slide..."
4,Continues Their Amazing Legacy Admirably,"How can one band come up with so many damn good songs in one career? The Beautiful South are not a band that can get away with throwaway tracks by simply laying down a beat, cranking up the guitars and ripping for five minutes. Their songs are delicate, almost fragile, supported only by the intelligence of the lyrics, the easy interplay between the three lead singers, and a seemingly endless supply of jaw-dropping melodies. Painting It Red checks in a 17 tracks and nearly 70 minutes and you will never hear a second of it on the radio in the United States, but this band is a treasure and Painting It Red continues their amazing legacy admirably."
3,There's an album in there....,"Well being a big TBS fan I ordered the ""bonus"" 20 track version of this disk from the UK early.As many have mentioned before, there are no golden tracks here, no Perfect 10's (although there is a version of that one), no 36D, no Red Eyes, etc. There is an albums worth of good tunes here, you'll just need to pick them out and burn your own CD to make listening worth while.Paul's voice is less than interesting, and the normal punch behind the lyrics just isn't there. That being said, I would say that the lyrics are up to TBS standards, just not the music.If you're a big TBS fan, then by all means buy it, there are enough good tunes to make it worth the dollars, if you're new to TBS, then start elsewhere."
2,"Really, not that great at all","I bought this because I stayed at Holiday Inn express and it seemed OK there. When I got mine, it was not as good. I think the motel kicks up there pressure more than a resident house has.It cannot compare to the Oxygenics that I already have and so far nothing surpasses Oxygenics shower heads.I also tried an Ultomate shower head from highpressureshowerheads.com and it is also better than the Kohler but not quite as good as Oxygenics.So there you have it, save yourself some time, aggravation, and money."
5,Excellent shower head!,"I bought this head because I am a frequently customer at Holiday Inn Express hotels, and this is the standard shower head at their hotel network. I really like the easy flow of water from the head, and the fact that you can adjust the pattern being projected. I highly recommend this head."
4,"Good, But Hoped for Better","This showerhead works well, but the flow isn't as strong as with the similar type showerhead at the Holiday Inn Express. Not sure if this is due to a difference in the design or perhaps the screen where the showerhead connects to the external plumbing. Our water pressure is quite strong throughout our house so I don't believe that is the issue."
1,Beware - This Showerhead is NOT AS PICTURED,"This Kohler product on Amazon's site (K-10284-BN) is the showerhead ONLY and does not come with the flange pictured for the vibrant brushed nickel choice. Very misleading, rather, actively DECEPTIVE promotion of sales to homeowners who choose online purchasing over limited choices in big-box home improvement stores."
1,Worst Shower Ever,"Not even sure its worth going into details. Just dont buy this thing, its horrible."
5,Replacement,This was an excellent replacement for the original showerhead I bought from the Holiday Inn site several years ago .
5,"Finally, a shower head that works","At last. A showerhead that provides a good stream, doesn't clog,and moves easily into massage mode and out again. Plus,it has good looks and quality fabrication that promise a long life. This product was easy to install which is a huge plus."
5,Kohler Showerhead - Holiday Inn Unit,"This is nice, heavy duty stainless steel with two different settings. It is the same unit in the nice Holiday Inn hotels."
5,Great shower head but needs strong water pressure for full effect.,"Product is great. Only complaint is that it doesn't seem as productive at my house than it was at Holiday Inn Express. I attribute this to lower water pressure at my house. I will have to look into boosting my water pressure to get the desired effect, and I'm sure it will be costly."
2,"Product was in good working order, but I was disappointed by it.","The shower head uses way too much water. I don't consider myself a conservationist, and still I am disappointed by the amount of water this uses."
5,An excellent text for RD's who work with disabled children,"A practical review of growth and nutrition for children with disabilities. Significant space is dedicated to nutritional evaluation in the beginning of the text. This is followed by many chapters for specific conditions that are found in the developmentally disabled pediatric population. The Appendices cover (but are not limited to) the RDA's and the RNI's, several condition specific growth charts, sample records and protocols, and quality assurance standards. If you work with this population you should have access to the Ekvall text."
5,Most Comprehensive Book for RD's,I found this book to be the most comprehensive compulation that I have come across in a long time. It was facinating. My fiends were laughing at me for reading it nightly before I went to bed. Then again I am a dietitian to the core. The chapters were full of facts you just can't find anywhere. The charts and appendicies were equally helpful. As a dietitian for Early Intervention is is nice to have ONE book you can look to for information about some of these really rare metabolic disorders.The author was readily available to answer any question.
4,Great collector's item/desk adornment,"I love the Simpsons! I love this episode... ""Just don't look"" = classic. The toy is a great way to remember the episode and since I have it at work with me it livens up my workspace, a lot! Aside from that, the quality of the toy is superior! The excellent painting, plastic molding and aspect ratio of Homer, the car and the Lard Lad donut makes for a durable piece of memorabilia. It's bigger than I thought it would be from the picture. I purchased a similar toy (Homie the Clown) and thought it would be that size. It has a few moving parts that are fun to change up (the donut moved forward as if Homer is pulling on it and Lard Lad's face becomes angry as the donut moves). I recommend this for any Simpsons fan or anyone who wants a quality, brightly colored classic Simpsons scene recreated for their desk, house or collection."
2,"Raggedy Ann & Andy Save Christmas... Yeah, right",Another typical somebody saves Christmas deal. This time Raggedy Ann and Andy have to save Santa's workshop from a no-good bad guy. Bare-basic animation and an unimaginative storyline make this a Christmas-as-usual holiday special... watch this only if there is nothing else left on the shelf that you haven't seen first.
5,i like this CD,"i like this CD a lot but this isn't the same cover as the one i bought in person. thanks a lot, matt collins, thanks for not selling me the CD with the cool cover"
2,Reference only - Consider ONLY if already good at XSLT,"The style of writing in this book makes it rather awkward for learning. Perhaps this is okay for a guru in XSLT, but I'm finding the book difficult to follow and more difficult to use."
2,For sale: One boat anchor.,"Agree with others that it is not a good introduction book. Dense, long-winded, I kept waiting for information I could use without needing to read 4 other chapters.As an added bonus, I'll throw in the XPath book as well. For those of you who have two boats."
2,"Critically flawed, but brilliant","I actually read most of the first edition of this book and upgraded to this book to stay current. It has two critical flaws:1) It lacks any ""New in 2.0"" labels. Given the scope and mass of the book, having to reread the whole thing to find the deltas between versions 1 and 2 is criminal.2) Horrible, horrible usability.If you didn't read the first edition, then the content is worth overcoming the hurdles. If you own the first edition, you're better off keeping it, and finding some other book to highlight what changed in version 2.0."
4,thrilling murder and consequences,"The Night of the Hunter is an old story and movie, but is a page turner as of today. Very exciting and intriguing."
4,Great Debut From A Promising Artist,"""What Is Love?"" is one of those early 80's, new wave songs, that will forever be imbedded into my head. I love that song, and the haunting feel it has to it. ""Human's Lib"", like most of HoJo's work, is a mixed bag at times. There are a number of great songs, with a few mediocre tracks in between. ""New Song"", ""Pearl In The Shell"" and ""Hide & Seek"" are HoJo staples. ""Conditioning"" makes you ask the question ""is this Thomas Dolby?"". Many of the songs on this album tend to sound the same if not in song writing styles, then in production values. A nice start to what would eventually lead to HoJo's masterpiece ""Dream Into Action""."
4,Howard Jones is simply the best!,"I will admitt that this probably isn't the best of HoJo's works but wow, it's still a great album with all of Howard's early hits. It's a neccestiy for HoJo lovers."
1,Nothing but problems,"The Electrovaya PowerPads ""Puff Up"" and become very ugly and dangerous looking. Here is a quote from the director of sales: ""...the battery can over-discharge and the cells can be damaged. In some cases when a stored PowerPad was later charged it puffed. The puffing was actually a good thing in that this is how the battery was designed."" Electrovaya has now reduced the length of their warranty to 6 months because they no longer like to support their PowerPads. I have seen this happen to 70% of PowerPads within 1 year of use. I would not recommend this product in any way!"
1,"old school electronic game, my fault, hasty purchase.",The product is for a Gameboy - I needed an Advance Gameboy game.still fits although it's old school back & grey. The front photo of the Gameboy is absolutely not what the actual game is once I started it up. I put it back in the box and will trade it in at a gamer's store.
3,Realize how small before purchase,"Let me preface by saying I love Le Creuset, but come on, 2-quarts? Thats only 8 cups. I got this free with the larger duch oven, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered. If you see the low price and are tempted just remember this is too small to do most things you would want a cast iron duch oven to do (frying, soups, roasts)."
3,Not Just Songs...,"Interspersed among the ten songs are three lengthy sermons which purport to introduce the next songs but provide a heavy dose of Mormon religious views, with even a photo of the leader of the Mormon Church. The 25% of the DVD devoted to preaching detracts from the mood continuity one might otherwise expect and can reduce your enjoyment of what are otherwise pleasant enough images and songs, though the latter are not sung with great patriotic energy."
1,flop,"I purchased this book. Author does nothing to explain what he means by Story Dynamics. You have to guess what he means. All you get for your $38 bucks, plus shipping, is a couple of scripts that the author has written, and script reader comments. This isn't a book. It's an expensive binder for the author's scripts. If I want to learn from other people's scripts I can go to the movies. At least the one's that made it to the movies are examples of scripts that were produced!"
1,no good,"The Electrovaya PowerPads ""Puff Up"" and become very ugly and dangerous looking. Here is a quote from the director of sales: ""...the battery can over-discharge and the cells can be damaged. In some cases when a stored PowerPad was later charged it puffed. The puffing was actually a good thing in that this is how the battery was designed."" Electrovaya has now reduced the length of their warranty to 6 months because they no longer like to support their PowerPads. I have seen this happen to 70% of PowerPads within 1 year of use. I would not recommend this product in any way!"
4,Powerful debut from first-time director,"I saw this movie at a small screening and was impressed by both the performances and the realism. It deals with the fantasy question of ""what if my life had taken a different turn at an earlier point?"" and warns against the constant questioning of what ""might have been"" at the expense of enjoying and appreciating what we have. The lead character of Jeff is plunged into what is both a nightmare, and a very ordinary life. Paul Clemens does a fine job of portraying his character as a real person, faced with a situation which usually gets a less than ""realistic"" treatment in Hollywood! His scenes of anguish over what he lost are wrenching for just that realism. Debra Henri stands out in the scene where she stands up for her own dreams in the face of Jeff's apparent self-obsession, and Jeff Bergquist gives an ultimately touching performance as Jeff's father.I commend Michael James Kacey (and his crew) for their fine achievement."
1,Terrible,"This guy is stuck in the 60s where Dads are all running off with their secretaries and Mothers are all sane responsible parents. Dad's are likely buying this book because they're either single Dads trying to find help raising their daughters or sharing custody with someone with issues. He's constantly patting himself on the back, which would be OK a little, but it's endless. All of that I could live with, but then the religion gets so intense about half way through the book I had to stop reading. I'm OK with people believing what they want, just don't push it on the rest of us, or at least warn us so we don't waste our money on this book."
2,Less than impressive,"In you enjoy reading books where you have to search long and hard for specific, biblical content, this is a good choice. Granted, there's not a lot of specific Scripture to fathering little girls. Still, this is a very ""secular"" book.It's not all bad, of course, and some of the daddy-daughter stories the author shares are good. But then there's stuff like when he (jokingly...like he thinks it's funny) shares a story about one of his little girls masturbating in front of the TV. His alarmed wife tells him to do something and his answer is to simply tell his daughter to go to her room to engage in that activity...yeesh."
2,"Nice concept, but too preachy/conservative","This book was dissapointing because the authors political and religious views permeate what is otherwise a very positive model for fathering. I'm sure Kevin is a great father, but not everyone is a Republican and/or Christian and you don't have to be either of these to be a good father."
4,IT Web Services,"If you are looking for a book that is more than just an explanation of acronyms, then this is the book for you. It not only explains the acronyms, but also gives you the background to understand how we got where we are with web services today.The author then goes on to explain the benefits and pitfalls of adopting web services. He also suggests how your organization might adopt web services. He has really given this area some thought and it points out some things that will help you sell web services in your organization, if you are thinking of adopting the technology.He includes a couple of interviews with leaders in web service. It is interesting to hear the perspectives of people on the cutting edge of the technology.Combine all the above with the author's easy to read style, I can definitely recommend this book."
1,POWERFUL WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"THIS PROGRAM WAS COPIED RIGHTED IN 1996/ IT WOULD NOT LOAD ON WINDOWS 2000.Recommended DOS 5 Or Win. 3.1..... 386 Processor~ 4Mb RAM. I did not know this program was THIS OLD. Keep your money. If you want this copy , you can find it in the trash!!!!!I'd been better off buying a book."
5,Great seller,"This transaction went perfectly. Book was delivered in a timely fashion. Seller included a nice letter as well as a cute homemade bookmark, which I love. Great experience. I would use this seller again and would highly recommend."
4,Typical Spencer - Great and Fast Read,"Funny this series started about 40 years ago and just stands the test of time. Parker is one of the masters of this genre and the third installment in the Spencer series shines. Relatively simple plot, but the pages fly by and Spencer is the ultimate guy's guy."
4,Mortal Stakes,"Spenser's hired by the manager of the the Boston Red Sox to find out if their leading pitcher is on the take. On the surface, everything seems OK, however there are a few little things that don't quite add up. Spenser decides in order to get to get a better understanding of whats going on in the present, he will have to investigate a few things from the past. He begins his search with a background check of the pitcher's wife. Facts he uncovers leads him first to a flamboyant street pimp and then on to the doorstep of a high cost madame of a New York bordello. The main problem turns out to be a loud, self-centered sports announcer with a bubblegum chewing bodyguard who owes money to a local mob boss."
3,Spenser investigates an All-American pass-time,"In the 3rd Spenser outing, he is hired to investigate the Boston Red Sox to see if one of the team is being paid to throw some of the games. His investigations take him to some strange places and he digs up some dirt he wasn't expecting - as well as some serious trouble for himself.Oddly enough, this book left me a bit cold - I can't quite place my finger on why I didn't find this book as enjoyable as the first two. Perhaps it is due to the many places where Spenser waxes philosophical for no particular reason. Perhaps it is the way that clues seem to just fall into his lap. Maybe it is just because I'm reading it at work and work leaves me in a foul mood. Whatever the reason, don't let me cause you to pass up this book; Spenser fans will want to read it so they don't miss out on a minute of this series."
5,Robert Parker's work is one of my favorites,"I have enjoyed every Spenser book I have read, Jesse Stone is also a favorite. I mourn the passing of Mr. Parker"
5,Pleased with Parker,"this is a Parker book and that says good reading.It was one of his first SPENCER books so It isn't as good as his later ones, but a writer has to start somewhere..."
1,Ummm........ahhhh!,"This doll is physco! It sucked out my soul and told me to write this:Hello,this doll is absolutly awesome (it's not)this doll is totally beautiful (it's scary!)this doll is your friend BUY IT! (DON'T it's you enemy!)save me........."
1,Is that Chelsea??????????,"I am a (...) my scene fan,but I can`t understand what happened to this doll.She is realy ugly.Dont get her.Get the real Chelsea doll insted like:Hollywood Miami Get (...)"
1,Ah!,"This thing SCARED me! Gah, UGLY!!""i hate this war between myscene and bratz, and this is my opinion on the whole thing.......I think myscene copied a bit off bratz....but you know, i think bratz copied off diva Starz, they were out way b4 bratz and tHey have the same style body, BIG HEAD BIG FEET....so MGA are just as bad as Mattel cuz they copied too! ""Erm, agreed, only BratZ dont even have feet.... And the feet you stick on them are normal sized.. And its more of the Mattel fans that are dissing and need to stop. I like to look at Bratz reviews, and I find more people that are Mattel fans and dissing MGA, and less MGA fans dissing Mattel when I'm looking at My Scene reviews.."
1,the ugliest doll in the world,how can you people live with adoll as this one? i mean look at her hands and feet! she clearly wouldn't stand achance agaist bratz! bratz rule and my scene as always suck!! when will you people relize that and quit wasting your money one these scary looking toys?!?!?!
2,Okay movie,"Not too bad , but not real good either.. just your average get a virus have less than 24hrs to live and save the day film here.Poor acting and budget killed this.If you are a Lorenzo fan..it's worth it to watch it."
5,VERY NICE,"I knew nothing about this film when I bought it but I am a fan of Lorenzo Lamas so I took a chance.Here is a film that does not include any martial arts, but simply shows Lorenzo playing the charactor of a man who is trying to save his daughter from a deadly virus.I comepletely enjoyed the film and the role that Lorenzo played. I hope to see him do more films like this one."
2,Good idea but broke pretty quickly,"PROS: IT's strongCONS: Broke relatively quickly and it's not easy to open and shut the hook, especially one-handedMY TAKE: I wouldn't buy this again. I'm looking for something easier to use and more durable."
3,"Good product, needs more strength","I bought 2 of these as my family and I were going on a ""nice"" airplane ride. We have 4 children under the age of 4, and these were purchased to help carry our luggage, car seats, carryons, etc(which there were many of them). We were probably using them with items that were too heavy, but I was still surprised at how poorly they held up. The first one broke before we were even on the first plane. The second one ended up working until we had gotten home. I'm sure it would be very nice to use for shopping bags, maybe a light diaper bag - but if you're looking for something heavy-duty this isn't for you!"
1,Great idea...cheap design,"I love the idea of this product. I purchased one and within just a few days, the spring clip broke. Very cheaply made. I suggest going to home depot as a previous poster stated!"
3,Cheaper elsewhere,"As someone else mentioned, you can find this cheaper at Home Depot but a different brand.As for the product, it's okay. I mainly used it to carry a ton of grocery bags from my car to the house. I used it ONCE at the mall. That time was perfect! I was with my two younger sisters and parents, and all of us combined had a lot of shopping bags. I clipped the hook to the stroller bar and it did a great job holding the bags."
2,"Ok, but broke after a few days.",I thought that this was a great invention. I was travelling with two kids so I wanted to be able to hook things to the stroller. We had carry on bags so I hooked a small kid carry on through the hook and attached it to the stroller. It worked great through the airport but broke after a few days on the trip when I tried to attach to the stroller again. Maybe it could not take the weight of the small carry on.
2,Loved It Before It Broke!,I bought this and it worked wonderfully for a while. Until my parents borrowed my stroller. I got the stroller back with the mommy hook broken. They didn't know how they broke it. My friend had one too and her husband somehow broke it. I would not buy this again because it would be a waste of my money. I got cheaper stroller S shaped hooks instead.
4,Rebranded household hook... Great marketing,"I bought something almost identical from Home Depot for $2.99. Just sold as simple versatile hook. The wording on the foam part just says something generic, not ""The Mommy Hook"". It works great for hanging things off the stroller handle bar!Mommies beware though, I've learned that many things can simply be rebranded / marketed as ""baby-fied"" items, and all of a sudden you're paying twice as much.That said, this is an awesome product when used as a stroller hanger."
2,Didn't last 1 week,"Great product; very handy; but for some reason, the particular hook I purchased broke within the first few days of use. I plan on purchasing another hook from Home Depot/Lowe's - identical size and function, cheaper price."
1,overpriced,"I decided to look for a similar product at a hardware store after reading some reviews that stated the spring mechanism was flimsy. I found the exact same product (and better quality) for a fraction of the price at the Home Depot. When most sellers are charging about $8 for this, it makes better sense to pay $2.99 at your local hardware store. The one I bought at Home Depot came with the foam a little more centered, but I was able to move it up around the bend just like the mommy hook. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Spring breaks too easily,We have owned two of these at separate times. Both of them within a few months have broken the spring that snaps the hook closed. It does hold a lot but just doesn't hold up to regular use.
2,Still trying to love it.,"I bought this hook because I had heard good things about it. I was hoping to use it on our stroller and was disappointed with it. For stroller use it doesn't work well hanging things on only one side, especially with air filled tires, the stroller wants to be weighted evenly. It also hangs down low so by the time you hang a bag from it the bag is hitting the tires or you or the ground. I like the idea it just didn't work for me. It is going to be retired soon and I might try leaving it in the car and see if it's more useful for carrying bags."
5,"Using for 1 month, so far so good!","Love this hook! Super convenient, allows me to hang my diaper bag and a couple other things (though not too many or I'll tip over the stroller) and easily access everything. The black part is great since it prevents the hook from sliding around on the handlebar. I've had no problems so far with the spring breaking or anything like that."
1,"Poor quality rubber, broke the first week","I got this hook last week and although it is strong metal-wise, the rubber was very cheap and was torn within the first few days I had it. I'm unhappy with how it looks now."
5,Very practical! Love it!,I bought two of these hooks because I used one on each side. It's been really helpful to be able to go shopping and put bags on the hooks attached to the carriage. Much better than plastic hooks. Plastic hooks beak very easily.
5,I love it!,"I originally bought this so I didn't have to keep bending down to get the diaper bag out of the basket in the bottom of the stroller, but the diaper bag was too long to fit on the mommy hook without rubbing the wheels. But it's perfect for going shopping or walking around. The grocery bags fit good. Love it!"
1,BOTH BROKE!,"Spring broke on BOTH of my Mommy Hooks after 3 shopping trips. The spring is not weight bearing at all, just used to open and close the hook. Heading to Home Depot to get the boat hooks we've used on our boat. Priced cheaper with better quality too!"
2,broke after 3 months,not really worth it... kind of a waste of mone.y mine broke after 3 months of use in the summer of just regular groceries...
2,Slides and broke within 4 months,Not impressed with this hook. It still slide around if you put it at an angle and broke within 4 months. And it wasn't even used every day.
5,A Must Have!,"I would die without my Mommy Hook! OK, I wouldn't die, but life with a stroller would be miserable! This hook allows me to hook on my heavy purse so I can reach for my keys and other items with ease. It can also carry extra shopping bags, a diaper bag, snack bag, you name it. So much better than trying to stuff your things into the little netted basket under the stroller! I am tempted to buy another one for my other stroller, but I guess I don't have to be that lazy. I can just switch the hook from stroller to stroller! Having 2 would also probably tempt me to load too many bags on the stroller. (Awkward having a stroller tip over backwards when you remove your little cherub. Tell me it's happened to someone other than me!) Great product!"
5,Love this,This is the best product ever made. I don't know why I didn't get one sooner! It hold some serious weight!
3,A great help!,"The directions say not to hang it on strollers and the like, but if you weren't using it for that, I'm not sure what you'd use it for. The spring sprang in our first Mommy Hook but we liked it so much that we purchased a second. It's definitely nice to have when you lack free hands."
2,"Excellent idea, flawed execution","When I saw this product, I was thrilled. I thought it would be perfect to attach to the stroller to carry my purse and shopping bags when I took my little guy to the mall or out to an outlet center. But the first time I used the product with only a small purse and a bag with 3 baby outfits, the spring mechanism broke. The company provided a replacement, and the springmechanism on the replacement replacement broke after about a month. I received a third one as a gift, and that one's working, several months later...though I don't use it often any more."
2,Broke after only using it twice,I heard wonderful things about the mommy hook so I decided to buy one and it broke after only using it twice. Its not even worth paying to ship it back to buy another one. I can see how useful it could be but I still wont buy it again.
1,Don't WASTE Your Money......,"This is a shame ....Steve Hillage is a very talented guitarist. The problem here is, that this CD is filled with spacey, non melodic songs that seem to be endless with no semblence of ""sense"". I would NOT recommend this CD to anyone interested in songs with structure and melody."
1,CF Voyager compatibility,"Product may work great with much older pocket pcs but the product description makes no mention of the voyager not working with win mobile 5. Only after looking at the manufacturers support website, in small type, does it mention that it does not work with win mobile 5. This will not work with any current ipaqs. I will be returning this product if possible."
5,Tell Hell... I Ain't Comin',"Very powerfull Play.. You have to watch it at least 5 times each time you will get something new out of it. Its for teenagers, adults, anyone..I often find my self thinking about this play at work or while driving down the street. This play will make you do some soul searching..regards,Kelvin"
3,My family and I enjoyed it.,"I saw scenes of this play on YouTube and I thought that it would be a good movie for my family to watch but, after seeing the whole play I had to loan it to some of my church family members to watch because, it really put something our your minds. Although the play can become a little bit campy at times the overall message hits home. I enjoyed everything about the play except the celebrity appearance at the end. (Shirley Murdock)She didn't fit into the plot at all! Tony Grant and the rest of the cast members carried the play all the way home for me.So, on that note I'll still give it 2 thumbs up!"
1,Tell Hell... I Ain't comin',"This video is messed up. It would not play on my DVD player, and would barely play on my computer. I had to work on it a while to get it to play at all. I would not recommend this to anyone to purchase."
1,total stink,i couldn's believe how dire this band was when i tried them out. not a half decent melody nor an ounce of character anywhere in sight. this band constitutes all the problems of modern rock music rolled into one. apparently the singer hates the clash - it therefore follows that the band are neither capable of recognising greatness or coming anywhere close to producing it. a first class stinker from a stinker of a band.
4,Not Their Best,"Fruitcake is an interesting band but this is not their best work. Like their other releases, the sound is reminiscent of Pink Floyd, with lots of spacey guitar, vocals drenched in reverb and vintage keyboards. However, the cheesy Farfisa organ sound can become annoying after awhile. I would recommend Room for Surprise as more mature and having better songwriting."
1,Poor Value for Money,"Short service life. Mine only lasted 13 months. Battery capacity suddenly dropped from 4-6 hours to 10 minutes. All tech support said was ""It has reached its end of life and may have to be replaced"". Pretty disappointing, given that it cost over US$400."
1,I dont like it.,"The Electrovaya PowerPads ""Puff Up"" and become very ugly and dangerous looking. Here is a quote from the director of sales: ""...the battery can over-discharge and the cells can be damaged. In some cases when a stored PowerPad was later charged it puffed. The puffing was actually a good thing in that this is how the battery was designed."" Electrovaya has now reduced the length of their warranty to 6 months because they no longer like to support their PowerPads. I have seen this happen to 70% of PowerPads within 1 year of use. I would not recommend this product in any way!"
4,Good Head phones,"The Zalman Surround sound headphones give good sound quality, and are good for movies. I would suggest them if you want surround sound but not if you want the best sound quality.They do have 3 plugs so dont get this if you are using a laptop."
2,You get what you pay for,"I could barely tell this was 5.1 surround sound, oh, by the way, they stopped working about 5 months after i bought them."
2,"Great Sound, Not good for Console Gaming PS3,XboX","Great sound, but do not buy if you are trying to use with a gaming console PS3,XBOX,etc. First You will need a sound receiver, Second the Zalman pre-amp, and then depending on the type of sound receiver you have you will have to make modifications to your wires. I had to strip my wires from the pre-amp and put them into the receiver. They are good headphones with great 5.1 sound and I dont think there is a subwoofer in them so I guess not 5.1, but surrond qaulity is great for headphones, also can wear for extended time periods without any pain 2-10 hours without discomfort . But very painfull setup process for non computer application, console gamers stay away from these unless you have some kind of knowlege on electronics."
5,A must for GAMING,This my second pair. I use them for playing BF2 mainly. Sound is great for 5.1 suround. You will always know where the action is. The only down fall with these is the wires are very fine and tend to break near where they enter the earphones. I had probably near 2000 hours of gaming before I broke down and bought a new pair.
3,Poor man's surround sound,"While these headphones have 6 speakers in them, they don't really convey the sound stage that well. You wouldn't really notice the surround effect unless you are watching out for them.The bass isn't that powerful either. The sound quality just doesn't compare to good modern stereo headphones.So if you ask me, I think you should just get a 5.1 speaker system (like theLogitech Z-5500) and a good pair of headphones to play games at night."
1,Requires a three jack input - doesn't work with my PC,I have no idea how well the phones work because the interface is a three jack TV type input - which is not to be found on a PC or laptop unless you have installed a three-socket interface board for games or you are using it on a dedicated gaming system..
3,Good while they last,"I haven't had these i a long time but at one time I owned two pairs. The surround sound quality was good and the worked as they were designed especially for the price. They were comfortable for extended wear as at the time I gamed for hours on most nights. The problem is construction and durability. Both pairs broke at the same spots at the second bend in the head band where the fold up. You can super glue and tape to repair the damage but it won't last long. There is too much stress on the head band in the way the ear pads press against the ear. Expect them to break, just a matter of time. I babied each of my two pairs but that didn't matter."
1,Comparable to a 5.1 home theater?,"The description says these are comparable to a 5.1 home theater. Are you kidding? The sound quality is like a clock radio! My 20 dollar Sennheiser headphones blow these out of the water. I am sending them back ASAP.Just do what I'm doing. Buy a pair of Sennheiser HD headphones, then buy the SRS HD Audio Lab plugin for PC, and the combo will blow these piece of garbage Zalmans away."
2,I only bought these because it fit the zalman external sound card,"HEAVY, uncomfortable, piece of _____ - yes, they work ok, but they are uncomfortable the SECOND you put them on. I listen for music, and it distracts from the listening...I hate them - I got them because of the 3 pronged ZALMAN external sound card...piece of junk...ok in the 80's not today.what a joke."
1,Broken,Well I got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker. Then the rear right channel didn't work at all. After calling tigerdirect to see about a refund. The first customer service rep was Rude and unwilling to help. Said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown UPS box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts. After getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough. The headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses. the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them didn't sound that good at all.
1,"about the Zalman ZM-RS6F 5.1 Channel ""Surround-Sound"" Headphones","(I'm not under 13, but i didn't feel like entering my e-mail adress and stuff) Anyway, i personally think these headphones kind of suck. I believe that it is much better to buy 5.1 surround speakers than to buy these headphones- the bass is poor, and i always get a weird popping noise when i'm playing FPS's. They're also not really surround sound, at least i don't think so, because there is no sound coming at you from in front or in back of you. I don't like the noise cancellation, either. It's no fun at LAN parties because you can't talk to people because you can't hear anything outside. To sum it all up, i think that these headphones don't measure up to 5.1 surround speakers, and Zalman needs to give this design more thought."
5,5.1 surround headset,These are a great sounding and easy product to use if you have a 5.1 surround sound card for your PC. I bought a set of these about 4 years ago and have always been happy with the quality and sound and comfort. I would NEVER recommend buying anything from AntOnline though. They have to be the worst example of an internet based co. to do business with. A total lack of customer service for problems. Amazon had to fix the problem themselves because AntOnline wouldn't repsond to them either.
2,old man with a view,The book was a disappointing. There was no organization or flow to the book. It was just a compilatiion of what seemed like random thoughts based on bits and pieces the author gleaned from other sources. This unsatisfactory book has a bright side - it has piqued my interest in looking for other more comprehensive books on Lincoln.
4,A good primer before I tackle the Goodwin book,This Is an interesting and revealing brief overview of his life. A good follow up to the movie. Read before the Doris Kerns Goodwin book.
4,Lincoln : The Man Or The Myth,"Excelent writing and interpretation of historiacal events and their results. Mr Lincoln was a neutral in religion which allowed him to be unbiased on slavery. Almost always in history, events are begun out religious or moral differences. Abe Lincoln knew which side to be on and it seem to the political side for accomplishing what he wanted to happen and not necessarily what he truly thought was right. He believed slavery was wrong, but knew also that it break up the states and the country."
4,Biographies of Abe Lincoln,There are many biographies of Lincoln and many good ones. This bio by Stephen Oates is one of the very best.
4,informative without being dry,It was fun reading this after seeing the recent Lincoln film. The book was informative without being dry. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Lincoln or our the story of our country.
5,A must read before seeing the movie Lincoln,After seeing the Stephen Spielbergs movie this book adds further insight to our greatest president.Oates offers creditable evidence of Lincolns committment to the principles outlined by the founding fathers. I am also impressed with how the author connects Lincolns profound belief in equal rights with the only choice Emancapation.
2,Abraham Lincoln,"Not what I expected. Did no finish reading the book. This book was just the author's opinion. I was looking fofr more facts about Lincoln,"
1,Don't care for thee book,Not what I expected. This is simply some professor who like to see his own words on paper. Not all that inforMative either.
2,Great song...lousy video quality.,"I bought this single for one main reason, the ""Christmas Video"" that this enhanced CD contains. Any FGTH fan already has the song itself elsewhere. Sadly, the video quality was pretty poor. You're much better off buying a FGTH DVD for the videos and forgetting this single."
3,Useful Book for Genealogists,Rhode Island in the Colonial Wars has a brief history of the King George's War (1740-1748) and the Old French & Indian War (1755-1762). A majority of the book consists of lists of Rhode Island men who served in these two conflicts. The book has limited notations for each soldier/sailor listing units and period served. This book would be useful for genealogists searching for information about early Rhode Island military men.
5,brilliant,This album is one of their best. I love almost every track on this album. If you like Sisters of Mercy you will not be disappointed by this effort.
4,Essential goth-metal.,"This debut of theirs may not be as popular as their next two albums, but it's still my favorite. It starts off with the great ""Black Planet"", which sets the mood for the rest of the disc. ""Walk Away"" and ""No Time To Cry"" seem to be favorites, but I don't like them as much as the rest. ""Marian [version]"" is an amazing and hypnotic song. Both ""Possession"" and ""Nine While Nine"" I like alot, and the former has an awesome bass groove. But the track I love most, and what makes this my favorite album of theirs, is the epic ""Some Kind Of Stranger"". It's got to be one of the most gothic, and dramatic love songs I've ever heard. I've played it by candlelight many times. Fans of ""Bauhaus"" and ""Type O' Negative"" order this now."
5,What a plesant surprise,"My friend borrowed my this about a month ago, and I don't want to give it back. Music this good is rare. Not a weak track; about half of this disc is just stunning. Cant wait to start collecting all of their cd's."
5,"This is petty, but....","Why not classify The Sisters of Mercy as ""goth""?? Because it only puts a limit on what people can perceive of their music without hearing it first. I know A LOT about what people classify as ""goth"" music, and most all of it does not deserve such a discriminatory label. It only boxes the bands' music into a stereotypical package, and it makes people think less of what the music actually is. Good music (as with anything) is only hindered by labels, and I really do not think anything deserves such pointless setbacks. Stereotypes should just be reserved for useless cookie-cutter bands of each ""genre,"" where the label precisely defines the bands in it. Why worry about what this or that band is labeled anyway?? Just listen to the music and see what you think about it for yourself."
5,Goth Godhead!,"This is one of the finest Goth albums ever made!Every song is a classic.Buy,buy,buy......."
5,Valerie,"As with previous purchases from Amazon the service was excellent I was kept well informed regarding all aspects of the ordering and paying as well as the tracking process, the parcel arrived approximately 3 weeks before the scheduled date. The parcel arrived in excellent condition. Once again thank you to all at Amazon, you are fantastic."
2,Ouch,"Sorry, but the only thing this album does well is get on my nerves. The only saving grace is Rock and a Hard Place, which gives us a glimpse of things to come on Floodland. Very simply, the whole album runs together in a liquid slur of wheezing noises. Hard to dance to and harder to listen to. Pass on this one and go straight to Floodland, the real masterpiece."
5,Good Instructions,"I wish I had read the complete set of instructions (contained in volumes 1-3 or in the single volume) much, much earlier in my life - even before my children were born. I took these 'instructions' in generic terms or as suggestions-I don't think the author would mind."
4,Good Program,"I got this program and it is simple to learn how to use, I have bought other programs like this and could never get the hang of it, This one is a lot of fun and quick to figure out."
2,3-D text program,This ok if you just want to do text. Me I'd choose Bryce 5.0 !It's kind of boring if it's just text animation. If you want it all get Bryce 5.0 !
4,Save your time and hassles with correct dimensions,"The product itself deserves 5 stars. Its beautiful, well made and sturdy enough to last forever. I took the star off as it fails to give correct dimensions. IT WILL NOT FIT 5 ft SWING. Not even 4 ft correctly. The distance between the hooks that are suppose to hang swing is 3 ft 8 in (yes not even 4 ft). The internal width is barely 5 ft. So it impossible to use it with 5ft swing. While 4 ft swing will fit, the chains would not be perfectly vertical due to <4ft distance between hooks. I think it is designed for single swing/chair style hammock. So save your time with this important information. Luckily, Amazon has awesome return policy."
4,swing stand,Very sturdy and easy to set up. Unfortunately one of the ends on the top portion came dented and had to have a metal fabricator reshape it so it would fit over the upright post properly.
4,Daisies and Compact Disks,"Steve Delopoulos' solo disk finds him venturing away from the sounds of Burlap to Cashmere and taking more of a singer/songwriter aproach. He avoids the excesses of ""Anybody Out There?,"" weeding out the over-drama of songs such as ""Divorce"" and ""Scenes."" Unfortunately, Delopoulos throws out the baby with the bathwater so to speak, as none of his songs reach the intimacy of ""Eileen's Song"" or ""Mansions."" These are still a fine set of tunes and there are many highlights including the beautiful guitar picking on ""Another Day"" and the exuberant synthesized ""Rocky Boat."" Although the song writing weakens towards the end of the album with the underwelming ""Mediteranean Waters,"" and the anti-climatic ""People Come and Go,"" ""Me Died Blue"" is an exceptional cd well worth a listen."
5,What An Album!,"Steven Delopolous is an amazing artist. The guitar work has some phenominal picking and has a great active folk sound. His voice is one of a kind and if you have ever heard him in his previous band you know. This solo album is a phenominal production with lyric that are both catchy and require many a liten to really get what he is saying. Daisies and Sandlewood is my top song, and it has the most interesting and phenominal sound. Buy this album!"
4,This is for Hawkwind Lovers !!!!,"If you love the progressive phase of Hawkwind and you don't have ""The Warriors on the Edge of Time"", this CD is the opportunity to get ""Assault & Battery"", ""The Golden Void"" and ""Magnu"". Good surprises like ""Hassan I Sahba"" are also present. I just wonder what ""Sonic Attack"" is doing there (OK, nothing is perfect...)"
5,"HOLLYWOOD, TAKE A LOOK","I wish the movers and shakers in the film world, e.g. Coppola, DeNiro, Scorcese would read GROWING UP ITALIAN IN GOD'S COUNTRY and find out what life for the Italian immigrant was really like at the turn of the last century.The stories within would make a riveting movie. There's the great-grandfather dropping dead face down on the railroad tracks his mouth full of cinders; a great-aunt dying in agony for lack of medicine only to have her coffin whipped by the Irish priest who was exorcising her ""sins""; the author's father, age 4, pulled from the Austin mill flood which took 78 lives;the author's mother hiding in the pantry from the Indian who came to breakfast. Often tragic, frequently humorous, always engrossing. Highly recommended."
1,Misrepresented,"I ordered what was advertised as a new Alpha Shield Network Firewall. The product box, not the shipping box, was torn and the case of the Alpha Shield was scratched and soiled. I can only presume that the device I received was was not new and its status is certainly suspect. I will not be able to test it until the first part of June. I would actually like to return it for a refund."
3,If you love Shushan get this album!,"Nice compilations of Armenian old country-side melodies. If you are a young Armenian and love dance parties, then why not to dance under contemporary rythms that have national roots. This is the type of an album which the more you listen, the more you love it. Watch for Shushan's new coming album ""Im Anoush Hayrenik"", which is expected to have her best, wonderful patriotic songs. Enjoy!"
5,"A must for anyone who is, knows, or plans to be, an elder.","A long term care and assisted living administrator for manyyears, this book amused me, unnerved me, angered me. I hooted withlaughter and got choked up with sympathy. A gifted wordsmith and storyteller both, Gould spun a tale I couldn't put down. I thoroughlyenjoyed digesting his delicious words and phrases. Educational,entertaining and absorbing; a must read for any aged reader. LindaLaPointe,MRA,..."
1,The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle,This was supposed to be a book. I was sent a video. I did not want a video and the price was outlandish. I would never have paid this much for a video. I have sent two emails to this person and have heard nothing from them. I would rate this person 0. I could not be any more dissatisfied!! I would like to send this movie back and get a refund. What do I do next?jorja merrick
5,Soft walk Adora Slip-on.,"I have a large, wide foot for which it is extremely difficult to find comfortable shoes. Ii bought one pair of Adora's last year and they became quickly my favorites. Comfortable, with a soft inside and a thick soft sole which protects the foot from the sidewalk pebbles it hugs my foot in such a way I feel I could walk for ever.I love them !"
2,Shoe Sizing,"Nice looking shoe for work/walking. However, it was too short. I wear a size 10 in most every shoe I've ever bought, but my toes pressed right into the tip of this slip-on."
5,Perfect shoe for me,"I have been looking for comfortable shoes to wear to work. I teach so I am standing most of the day. All the brands of comfort shoes I bought did not five me enough support and my feet would ache at the end of the day. Not these shoes. They also don't look like ""old lady"" shoes. I am ready to order the brown pair."
1,Uncomfortable Shoes Unlike La Palma Shoes,"I used to wear the Softwalk La Palma Shoes for work and they were extremely comfortable and wide. Unfortunately, Softwalk stopped making this style of shoe, so I purchased the Adora's as they appeared to match the style. However, these are very narrow shoes, even in a double wide size. Needless to say, I returned these shoes immediately."
2,walking across america,"I work for an airline and walk all day on the airplane. I had a shoe from softwalk similar to these shoes, and they were fabulous, however, this was the same type of shoe, but not as comfortable. I ordered a 1/2 size larger than what I needed, and it was still too short. I sent this shoe back because it broke in the wrong place when you took a step and it rubbed all day. I ordered another shoe from softwalk with a longer top on it, and hopefully it will work well."
5,Heavenly walking!,"I have happily and joyously walked for the last 10 years in 3 different pairs of these Adora Softwalks purchased seamlessly thru Zappos.com. They have worn well on the heals and the cushioned linings. They are light for my feet which do not tolerate heavy tennis shoes built with inflexible sole materials. Polish is all that is required for the leather pairs (Black, and Navy) and an occasional brushing for the suede keeps them looking like new.I swear by their comfort and support. I have had no problems with sizing. For cushioning I wear a professionally fitted, non-prescribed orthotic in my daily tennis shoes which would not comfortably fit or wear for me in the Softwalks, but I find I don't need it with my Softwalks. This was the best buy that I know of -- short of custom-made shoes -- for my needs, which if I had gone that route would probably have netted me at that time perhaps one pair which would not work for my active life over the long haul."
2,Not for me,"This shoe is probably good if it fits you properly. Although the width seemed correct at the balls of my feet, something about this design pinched my feet where the upper portion of the shoe ended.However, since the poor fit was immediately apparent, I had no problem returning these shoes."
5,amazon's source is better,"This shoe is the only one I wear as a work shoe. I have been buying adora shoe for several years now.. been through over 10-12 pairs over the years. They are comfortable when you buy them. Do not have to break them in. I have a wide foot with narrow heal,and these are the first shoes I have ever tried that are good for both.I have bought these from other sources with slightly less satisfaction. I bought two pair of this brand/style which did not have sufficient padding in sole and sides.(Don't know if they were ""rip-off"" copies or not as they cost the same. When I bought my last pair from Amazon, I got the original I fell in love with. Soft Walk indeed. My feet feel great after hours on the job. I recommend them to anyone...try the different sizes and widths til you find the right one for you."
5,LOVE these shoes,"I love these shoes. Purchased my first pair 8 years ago prior to a trip to Paris. Wanted NON-athletic shoes I could spend all day in, walking and standing. These were perfect. The egg-crate sole is soft, yet offers great arch support. While they may not be exceptionally stylish (I refer to them as my ""Minnie Mouse shoes"") they are several steps above leather lace-ups or running shoes. And more comfortable."
4,Navy Softwarlk Adora Slip-on Review,"I'm still breaking them in, but they are exactly what I needed to replace an old pair of navy shoes. Quick transaction."
4,Good Start to Literature,"(This review is for the 1987 edition.)This guide provides basic study techniques for students of English in the UK. The first part covers analysis; how to find themes in a work, how characters support a theme, the general structure of a story, the use of style and imagery, and how to study irony. The second part describes how to compose and write essays during an English examination.The language in the book is kept simple and there is hardly any jargon. In each chapter, a method for studying each topic is first described and then a worked example is demonstrated. No particular interpretation is pushed and the student is encouraged to read works and come to their own conclusions. All the techniques are then brought together in the chapters on essay writing.Although aimed at students, this guide would help anyone who is interested in gaining a better understanding of literature.Kam-Hung Soh, 24 November 2005."
4,intensive,"I felt like my legs were shaking during and after the exercise. Good for muscle training.What I think is missing the graceful Ballet moves, which I expected."
1,Not Happy,I bought these as a supplement to Physique 57 in training my clients. I bought them based on the reviews written. What a BIG mistake! These DVDs can easily put you to sleep. I opened and tried about 5 minutes of each DVD and was seriously disappointed. I returned them only to find out this seller charges over 50% as a restocking fee. I find this practice to be totally unacceptable on any level. Unless you absolutely have to have this DVD - do not buy it. Go buy the Physique 57 set of DVDs.
2,Don't like the voice over,"I am sure that this DVD could be a good workout, however, I really don't like the voice over ( it's her recorded voice as she is working out) I also found it boring, but it was a bit of a challenging workout. I have done Tracy Anderson and Tracy Mallet""s workouts and prefer them, over this one... will be returning it"
4,"Nice workout, but those with knee problems be careful!","I am a huge fan of the Bar Method, Physique 57, Lotte Berk, and the Tracy Anderson Method Mat Workout. I do some form of bar every single day, so I'm about as familiar with it as one can be without taking classes outside the home. I had never heard of this Ballet Body series so I was really excited to receive it in the mail. It was fun to do and was easy enough to follow, but I never felt that intense burn in my legs like I do with some other dvds, namely the physique 57 and bar method dancer's body. Also, later in the day I noticed my knees sort of ached, which is very unusual for me. I'll definitely give the video another chance, but if it yields the same results the dvd probably won't make it into my rotation."
3,Early Natural evolution book simple for beginners,"The cycles of nature explained in growing terms of creatures living in bioregions, in historical ecology in clear language & drawing, The explain some bad effects of us humans hurting species in habitats we've destroyed in last century while overpopulating, polluting, eating, wearing & burning Nature. They ignore us loosing our organic instincts & learning how we're ruining our landscapes by super-tech pollution & growing while mutating us & them. There's rare natural landscapes in US now, as old growth forests are 97% gone for paper, cardboard & wood building things. This '72 ecology book is seems nieve now with cute nature drawings, or am i cynical about our ruining our homelands? & using Permaculture to live naturally healthy?"
3,Tricky Product Name.....,"Watch out...this is the power supply only, not a 7 bay ATX Case with PS included. Be careful not to make the same mistake I did."
3,Good power supply for a low price,It's been about a month since I've gotten this power supply and I haven't had any problems yet. So far so good. No complaints.
2,Never worked well. One of those if it's too light it's bad PSU's.,"Didn't get it by choice. PSU on my dads emachines went bad so they replaced it with this thing. Expensive and a POS. Tended to shut the emachines off randomly and in the end probably destroyed it. The Logisys 550 (really 500) black for $20 I had success on another machine and suggested that to him. Only Logisys bucks the trend of light weight monster machines. Hardcore metal on the allied, but thats about it. Thing didn't last a year. Logisys put it in in 2004 still running. Course we just tossed the emachines (not the hard drive, not the smartest idea. I destroyed the drive thanks to a torx set and a sharp object, kept the PSU, Floppy and the modem. but everything else went bye bye."
2,Doesn't work well at low power load,"These Allied 300W power supplies do not work well when there is a small load applied, and in fact shut off in that situation. This is a problem when using them to power single devices outside a computer such as tape or hard drives."
3,Not exact duplicate,"Didn't have all the cables that the old one had, but plenty to get my computer working. I'm satisfied with it and would buy another one if needed"
1,ATX 100-g2-usb Atx Mid-tower Case 250w Front U,"I had the same experience as Wendy in Nebraska. The description is clearly of a computer case, and all I received was a power supply. I complained and Amazon sent me another power supply. I refused it, and will return the first one for a refund.Someone at Amazon should read the reviews and make some corrections.Newell Stallones"
5,Excellent Cam!,This is am excellent digital camera! It has alot of great features including being able to be used as a webcam and able to record a short length video. With a capacity to store up to 300 low resolution pictures is a great picture still. and able to store up to 50 high resolution pictures. it is a very good buy especially for it's price. i would reccopmend this as the best camera ... and all of the Dolphin Peripherals are great products!
3,fun toy,[...] It takes 20 pictures on High Resolution which is really the only setting you will want to use. The resolution is very low so the pictures are grainy. The pocket size is nice and compact but spy camera? I don't think so. The camera beeps alot which tends to attract attention. Not useful for serious photography because of the low resolution but still it does what I expected it to do [...]just realize that you are getting a toy not a camera and you are fine with it.
3,Fun Gadget,"The Dolphin spy cam is fun to use and is so small that you usually have it with you when a picture moment arrives. The quality of photos is low but OK for email. It won't take the place of a ""real"" camera but for the price, you will have a lot of fun with it."
3,"A Cool Camera, But Loves Batteries","This camera is very unique, because it is very small and slender (so small, that is can fit easily in a shirt or pant pocket. You will probably like it most because of that fact. It is digital, so you can load pictures on your camera just by plugging the USB cable into the camera and the computer. One annoying thing about the camera is that it uses batteries up very fast. It doesn't have a power button, so you have to wait about a minute for it to go off. The pictures only look clear when they are small, because the camera doesn't have high resolution like other digital cameras. Other than these things, it is a good camera, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera."
5,Great Tool,"This tool fits perfectly on the oil canister on our 2009 Toyota Sienna and on the oil filter on our 2007 (4 cylinder engine) Toyota Camry. You'll save over $40.00 buying it on Amazon compared to buying it elsewhere. I agree with ""Chops"" though, as the part is shorter in length than what the picture shows."
1,Does not fit,1 MM too small for 09 Rav4 filter. It is only 64.3mm and the filter housing is exactly 65. Why sell a 65mm tool if it is 64.3?
2,It Fit Perfectly...But then it BROKE on first try!!!,"**I POSTED PHOTOS OF THE BROKEN WRENCH ABOVE***Alright, So this wrench fit perfectly on my 2010 Toyota Corolla 1.8 oil filter/cannister (whatever you want to call it). However, the wrench broke. I posted photos above. Please take a look as too what I mean when I say the wrench broke. I gave two stars only because the product actually fit the oil cannister, but unfortunately its poor qulaity.I will replace this review with a better one if the Manufacturer send me a new one. Until then this review will stay.Thanks,Gio"
1,Too small for '08 Tundra Crewmax! Don't believe reviews.,"I purchased this item based on the reviews here at Amazon. I was excited about FINALLY finding a tool that would help me remove the dang oil cartridge cap. Long story short (and after a lot of frustration): This item is TOO SMALL for my 2008 Tundra Crewmax, I can't speak for other models. Went to AutoZone and they don't sell the part, which is why I turned to Amazon. Now I'm going to have to purchase the item from Toyota themselves...sigh."
3,Does not fit 2010 Rav4,"I purchased one of these but it does not fit the 2010 Rav4 oil filter cap, it is way too small. I have a 4 cylinder engine."
3,End cap review,"This did not fit my Rav4 V6. Tool looks to be quality made, but check the size with a caliper to be sure it will fit. It was 3mm too small. Doesn't sound like much but it didn't fit."
1,KD 3253 Oil Filter Wrench,"I agree this item is a piece of junk. First time I tried to use it, the spot welded nut snapped off in my socket wrench. Just hope I can get my money back. I'll try another brand next time. Don't waste your time and money with the KD brand."
1,HORRIBLE!!!! broke on first use,"dont buy this product, I bought it for my 2010 toyota corolla because you need a special tool for the oil filter housing, the put where you insert the wrench into broke on the first turn, waste of money. at least amazon let me return it broken."
2,Low quality,"Failed on second use, nut separated from body. Took broken shell to department store and found Toyota filter housing is same as Puralator L14477 filter if you dont have time to order one."
1,broke 1st time i used it,"The first time I put pressure on this wrench, the top metal piece broke off. I do not recommend this product. It is cheap."
3,Not Perfect,"K-D Tools 3253 End Cap Oil Filter WrenchI bought this product to use with my Toyota plastic filter cartridge. I had to push pretty hard to seat it so that it wouldn't slip. Then, it was on so tight, that I had to pry it off with a screwdriver. Worked OK, but not perfect."
2,Poor Construction,It broke the first time I used it. There is a piece that connects with your ratchet which is tig welded on to this piece. I broke it right off. You can go to any local Autozone or Advanced Auto Parts and buy a piece that has no welds that can break for just 5 or 6 bucks. This was not worth it.
1,Was to small,"As the title indicated, the wrench did not fit. I even try hammering it in and thats a big no no. 2008 Tundra 5.7L."
1,K-D = Agony and frustration,"If you want total frustration and agony, put your Toyota TUNDRA on a lift, remove the skid plate 8 bolts, drain the oil 7.9 quarts, drain the filter with a special ""make a mess"" plastic tool AND THEN find the K-D 3253 doesn't fit and you can't remove the filter! At least the temperature was only in the high 90s. And of course I was working outdoors. Dante has reserved a special place for K-D designers and quality control people. Don't try the ""tool"" near children or impressionable adults."
1,Piece of JUNK ! !,"This was suppouse to fit my 2010 RAV 4 filter canster, but it slips and does not fit, really a useless piece of junk stay away from it, but the Assenmacher TOY 640 oil filter socket wrench fits perfect, BUY THIS NOT THE K-D 3253. You've been warned by a person that went through oil fliter wrenches till I found one that works ! !"
1,K-D 3253 Filter Wrench too small,I have a 2009 Rav4 with a filter housing measuring 65.4 mm flat to flat. The KD 3253 measures 63.9 flat to flat. It doesn't fit the filter housing.
3,Little bit loose on Venza and Rav4,"Very good price.When I use it on Venza and Rav4, it is a bit loose and stuck to the filter cap. I have to knock to unstuck."
2,not fit product ordered for,"solid enough metal to work w/o flexing. will NOT work on 2008 toyota highlander, 3.5 engine. too small diameter. even tried moderate amount of pressure hoping for a snug fit but never worked. don't buy for this model hoping it will work. i don't understand how other sites when searching w/ google describe a 64mm as what's needed. if this is truly a 65mm and too small..."
1,Doesn't Fit,"I have a 2009 Toyota Highlander Sport. I am well advanced on the mechanical side of things. This oil cap filter wrench was listed as fitting my truck when I initially ordered it. I even looked at the K-D website. It does not fit. I have even gone to NAPA and AutoZone trying to find the correct wrench size. After three orders with people telling me it would fit I ended up making my own. This may work great for other vehicles, but not the 2009 Highlander."
4,Part sold by Toyota - official wrench,"This is the version that you can buy at a Toyota dealership (i.e. the ""official"" wrench). My Highlander had the oil filter torqued on by an impact gun and it took this item + a breaker bar to loosen it. Skip the 65/67mm combo tools & get a real 64mm oil filter wrench for Toyota oil changes. I also got the Assenmacher oil filter wrench which I prefer over this brand (thicker walls with less flex)."
1,WILL NOT fit '08 Highlander,I'm a do-it-yourselfer but I've done hundreds of oil chnages over the years. Like some of the other reviewers here I attest that this wrench DOES NOT fit all Toyotas. And though I'm a Toyota fan they must have been out of their minds with this design!PS: I picked up a store brand wrench designated 64-66mm from Advance Auto Parts for about $5.00 that worked just fine.
