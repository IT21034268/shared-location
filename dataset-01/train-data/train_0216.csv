3,Never got it,Sadly I paid for the product and have yet to receive it. Supposidly USPS delivered it but I guess it must have gotten stolen or somethin...oh well
5,The Best Christmas CD EVER MADE!,"I've listened to this CD since I was young and it brings back such warm memories of home and family at Christmastime. (Although I listen to it all year round :) It would not be Christmas without Kenny and Dolly. Just hearing Dolly's sweet voice makes me smile every time without fail. If you want the best Christmas CD EVER, then this is the one for you! You will NOT be disappointed!"
4,A real love filled country Christmas CD.,Dolly and Kenny combined their voice to sing a beautiful hamorny of songs. All the songs are filled with love. Some traditional songs are mixed in with those depicting a Christmas in the country. A wonderful collection that no Christmas collection is complete with out.
5,Classic Christmas from the Eighties...fun and playful,"I grew up in the Eighties listening to the ""Once Upon a Christmas Album"". My Mom wore it out and I only had a dubbed cassette version which I lost. I had been searching for this on CD each Christmas and was esctatic when I got it in early December from my parents about two seasons ago!These songs were performed on a CBS special, and it has been a long time since I saw it on TV. Kenny and Dolly are playful and obviously have fun singing together. Dolly's original songs, make this a new taste of Christmas. My favorites are ""Once Upon a Christmas"" an original composition, and ""Christmas Without You"".A country fan will love this CD, but mainstream listeners will like it too, because there is very little country ""twang"" to it. This is one of my favorite Christmas CDs (only slightly behind Martina McBride's Christmas CD). A great gift idea."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!,I love this CD!!! I grew up listing to this on tape as a kid. I bought it on CD this year and played everyday during the Holidays. It really took me back to my childhood.
5,Great Christmas Music!!,I love this CD! Kenny and Dolly together make the best Christmas CD. Quite a few of these songs were played on our local radio station through Christmas and I knew I needed to have the songs for myself. You won't be disappointed.
2,"Music sounds great, but definitely a burned copy...","Love the music, but know for sure it is a burned cd because when I downloaded it into iTunes, I had to write in all the songs. Also, the case was cracked in 2 spots and was not sealed. The price tag was also half on as well. At least it sounds good."
4,One of the Essential Christmas Albums,"What a wonderful album to own.I remember literally wearing this album out as a younger person. We owned it on LP and I always looked forward to listening to it.It is perfect listening for cooking Christmas goodies, decorating the tree or even wrapping presents. Every song is great. All you will need to accompany this CD is your tree ready to decorate, a lit fire, and your favorite Christmas beverage."
5,Christmas Memories,"These songs keep great memories fresh! A Christmas tradition for me. On the road or wrapping gifts, either way I'm happy!"
2,Once Upon A Christmas,"This CD could have been much better because of the talents of Kenny Rogers and Dolly Pardon. Most of the songs were ""HO HUM"" not ""HO, HO, HO""."
1,CD Once Upon a Christmas,I was very disappointed with this purchase. I know the holiday music is great but the CD cracked when I removed it from the case. I never got to play the CD. Very disappointing.
3,Great Album; Just Be Aware,"This is a good item, just be aware like some other viewers have noticed, it is not the original. HOWEVER the original is available in CD too, you just have to look for it, and know what your buying. I first heard Dolly Parton's Winter Wonderland/Sleigh Ride song on the radio a few years ago around christmas, and same goes for her ""Hard Candy Christmas"" single and got to really liking them both, and wanted a copy of each. So I found and purchased the original album, and got the ""Hard Candy Christmas,"" as a single download, since it's easier to find that song than Kenny Rogers solos over the internet. For some reason this new release seems to only have the rights to releasing Dolly Parton's music only."
4,Fun and Loveing,"This album has been around for many years and I have thought it to be one of the best albums for the season since the first time I heard it,long ago. I think that Dolly and Kenny sing wonderfully together and should do more albums together. this is just realy a great album and I hope others enjoy it as much as I do."
5,Christmas with Kenny Rogers,"Kenny Rogers has recorded 5 christmas albums since the 1980s, this was his second. It's classic christmas that only very few singers can do. Kenny Rogers is the best."
4,Just like back when,I truly enjoy this album and listening to it as we put up the Christmas tree was heartwarming and brought back all of those memories of childhood and doing the same thing.Well worth the money.
5,Best Holiday CD!,I love this CD! I have been listening to this music since I was a little girl. I finally had to have a copy of my own!
3,RE-ISSUE CHEATS FANS OF TV SOUNDTRACK,"For those who don't remember, this CD was issued as the ""soundtrack"" for the Kenny/Dolly TV special ""A Christmas To Remember"". The one-hour telecast did not feature Dolly's Hard Candy Christmas. That song comes from Dolly's theatrical version of ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"". To omit Kenny's ""Silent Night"" and ""Christmas Song"" renders this collection overpriced for a 9 song set. How many people know the words to the THIRD verse of ""With Bells On"" (not included on this CD or its predeceasor)."
5,Christmas music,"I have purchased so many of theses CD's in the past. I play them so much I wear them out, plus also give as gifts. This was the easiest way to purchase, also the fastest. I was totally satisfied with my purchase, and with how fast I received it. Thanks!"
4,Wish I'd Had It When Pregnant,I wish I'd had this when I was pregnant. But I have it now and it has come in very handy. I don't use it all the time but it's very comfortable when I do. I use it a lot more with our glider when I'm pumping or just rocking the baby. I wouldn't buy it until you see if you need it.
2,nice bench but I need to drill one hole more,"quality control is an issue. I don't have a drill so haven't fixed the problem yet, but one of the screw holes is very shallow. Not being a tool handy kind of person, I haven't fixed it yet, so the bench is sitting in a corner, unused. but I'm sure it would be a great bench if I could finish putting it together."
5,Great for nursing moms,"Excellent stool, easy and fast to put together! really helped my wife find the perfect position to hold the baby"
5,Legit,This was super simple to put together (3-5 minutes). It is so sturdy. I wouldn't mind having half a dozen of these around the house to use. I imagine that they would work well for getting to the top kitchen cabinet shelf. Also works for leveling out your lap when you need to sit and type on a laptop computer.
3,"Nice stool, but doesn't work for me","I have been having horrible back problems since the third trimester of my pregnancy. And things got worse when my son was born. I simply could not get comfortable while breastfeeding, and was having trouble maintaining good posture, so my back was getting worse and worse. I ordered this stool thinking it would help me get comfortable and sit straight. Unfortunately, it has not helped me at all.I think one main problem is that I am very short: 5'1"" and change. When I sit on my couch, my feet don't reach the stool. So it doesn't help me there. While I sit on the miniature recliner in my baby's room, my feet do reach, but the sticky pads on the feet of the stool are not sticky enough. So if I put any weight on the stool at all, it slides away from me in seconds.This is a nice product, and well made. I just wish it worked for me. :("
5,A perfect footstool!,"I have used this footstool for 25 years, along with my little wing chair, since I was nursing my babies. My kids are all grown now, but I still use the footstool all the time to avoid lower back pain when I am using my laptop in my new wing chair. I can't imagine working in the chair without it. The footstool is so sturdy and has lasted all these years. I am ordering a new one just like it since I will be working away from home five days a week and I can't imagine life with it."
3,"Great Stool, horrible parts!","I got this stool obviously to help when nursing baby on my glider, as I am very short and is difficult to reach the floor and rock myself at a 90 angle. I received the stool from seller in 2 days as I have Prime, to put it together is fairly simple, just pegs and screws. However, a very big however, as I was assembling it I noticed the pegs don't fit and screws are misaligned what the heck! I managed to put it together but at a very big downside, the sides cracked because surprise surprise, the pegs were too huge for the little measly hole they were supposed to fit in so as I screwed it in place both side supports split in half!Although its cracked on both sides I have to say it still does its job and is fairly sturdy. It's not as if I intend to stand on it, honestly it supports me and I think it holds fairly well, I probably won't risk it.Overall, it would have received 4-5 stars if they actually made the parts right because it serves its purpose!"
5,Great for ergonomic work station,"This stool works great under a desk, and it's half the price of comparable foot rests sold by office supply stores."
5,Great for nursing moms,"This product has made it so much more confortable to nurse my son. I even use it when pumping or bottle feeding. It was easy to assimble (no real tools ""required"" but I did bust out the drill to make sure the screws were in there good.)A must have for nursing moms."
2,So-so,"I used this stool during my baby's first month. It did make breastfeeding a little more comfortable. But after the first month, it became more of a hindrance. You don't need it if you are using a nursing pillow, like ""Boppy"". Pricey. Better to borrow one from a friend."
5,My back would have been broken without it,"I was skeptical that a little stool like this could make a big difference, but I am now a believer. What a difference a little angled stool makes! In fact, it made such a difference that now that I'm back at work, I am ordering a second stool for underneath my desk at work so my arms and back don't hurt as much. I'm short (5'3"") and I'm not sure the stool would make such a big difference for taller people, but for me, it helped so much when breastfeeding, bottle-feeding, and just in general. Great product, and easy to put together as well."
4,"Good quality, good height. Could be wider.","I really like this stool. It's sturdy and well-build. Only complaint is that it could be a little wider for me. I like to keep my feet apart somewhat when I nurse.Amusingly, my toddler thinks this is his ""chair"" and uses it when we read books before bed time."
2,"""OK""","I should have purchased the adjustable nursing stool, then it would be useful with all my chairs. Easy to assemble, I did not find grip ridges to be uncomfortable, and the finish isn't bad."
3,"Good, but tips easily and is a safety hazard","I registered for this stool when pregnant, thinking it would be a nice position-helper while breast feeding, and it is, with one drawback: it tips easily if you put any weight on the edges (top edge or either side). So far, this hasn't been a huge problem, except for making a loud THUMP every time I do it, which sometimes startles the baby. I would just suggest that you avoid ever using it as an actual stool and never step or stand on it, and keep any little kiddos away from it too.Other than the potentially dangerous tipping thing, it is a nice wood piece and went together very easily. As stated before, I would not use it in place of a safer flat stool, but it would be absolutely great under a desk to prop up your feet while working."
4,"Like the height, hate the ribbing",This is a great stool. It make my legs the perfect height to nurse my son in his boppy.My only con is that there are ribs on the top of the stool and if you don't wear socks or something to cover your feet it tends to hurt them.Maybe I just have sensitive feet...but that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 starts.
5,Wonderful!,"I agree with all of the other positive reviews! I can't think of a single negative thing about this stool! We have an antique rocker that was passed down and this makes rocking, feeding, and just holding baby so much easier - especially since I am short and can't reach the floor easily when rocking!"
4,4 1/4 stars,"See story summary above.I thought this was a very enjoyable medical thriller. It reads similar to a Robin Cook novel. The backbone of the novel is about herbal supplements. Good or Bad? You decide. Though an average medical thriller, it will educate you at the same time it entertains you. Both emotional and suspenseful, it will definitely keep you intrigued.Recommended for the lover of medical thrillers."
4,Suprisingly good,"I admit I wasn't expecting much, I bought the movie used from Amazon because it looked interesting. It turned out to be a good story, very well acted. Glad I got it."
3,pretty Good film,"i got a chance to see this film recently&it took me a while to figure everything out,but once it got rolling it all came together. this film had some good solid parts. the Brother&Sister dealing with there own personal issues and the challenges they had to deal with. the Uncle was a Good Natured Man. it was a film that will keep your interests. I'd give it close to a 3 and a half.alot of interesting situations and i like how it ends."
4,"Thorough, but somewhat repetitive, exposition of Revelation","The text consists of material from sermons and,therefore, has quite a bit of repetitive material.It is very complete, though, and serves as anexcellent exposition for anyone needing commentaryon the Book of Revelation. In almost all cases,the author takes the fundamentalist view. He isalso of the futurist school. These two positionsagree with my leanings, so they were not a problemfor me. Others, though, may want to take his stand into consideration before purchasing the book. I would recommend it as a reference, but perhaps would not as general reading since itis quite large and (as I have mentioned) somewhatrepetitive."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"Mamoru Oshii has put out pretty impressive videos, this is not one of them.The main character pursues his old master (like a Stray Dog.. ) who left his unit behind. Throughout the entire movie all he does is walk down streets (they even walk the same streets over pointlessly ) , occasionally bumping into a guy that feels life can be summed up in his ""Stray Dog philosophy"", then eating, then walking around some more. All the while a horrible piano tune plays.Don't let the cover fool you, there really isn't many kerberos panzer cops in this movie. It's not until the very end does the main character put on his nifty leather armor and mow through baddies, which was about the only exciting part of the movie (no cheesy piano music either!).Not much of a plot, predictable, and boring. If you're interested in Mamoru's live action movies Avalon is better. If you absolutely have to have something with kerberos cops in it try Jin-Roh The Wolf Brigade."
3,Expect The Stray Unexpected Dog,"Straw Dog is unlike any movie that I have seen. Like many people, I expected an intense action film after seeing ""Jim Roh"", Mamoru Oshi's animated masterpiece but the bulk of ""Straw Dogs"" is a beautiful, poetic mediation on trust and betrayal with plenty of sublime imagery. At first, I was put off by the main character Ishi seemingly directionless journey in China to find his former master from the Capital Police (the heavily armored Kerberos who were disbanded 3 years before).With action at both ends of the film, the middle can seem boring unless you transcend the action movie expectations. It's full of serene sea-side beauty and some interesting shots of a Chinese village. There is some great action and violence at the end that's a bit confusing as to who Ishi's adversaries are but it's worth the wait."
4,A must-read for activists,"It is a practical guide to understanding movements, what are their stages and the role different people play on them."
5,Factual correction regarding the instrument used in the English Suites,"The instrument Leonhardt plays in his recording of the English Suites is not a genuine antique, but rather a forgery made by Skowroneck and passed off by GL for a decade or so as a harpsichord made in 1755 by Nicolas Lefebvre of Rouen. Lebvre was a real organbuilder and instrument maker in Rouen in the middle of 18th century, but none of his harpsichords actually survive. All was revealed by Skowroneck in a fascinating article in the Galpin Society journal in 2002. The instrument, incidentally, is really fine and sounds as good as many antiques"
1,Buy The Book of Questions instead...,"not very ""thought-provoking"" as the book claims, just get Gregory Stock's Book of Question's instead if you ARE looking for a true ""conversation piece"".."
3,Decent book,I edited some of the questions when I used them to ask my family and friends. Some of the questions in the book were just absurd or ask any question I wouldn't want anyone asking me.
2,not that good,"Sorry, but I bought this book because I love the ""if"" books and I thought this would be cool too. Basically it's a pretty lame imitation of those books. Yes there are some good questions, but most of them are pretty standard. And it seems sometimes like the writers treat you like a little kid. Shoulda saved my money."
1,not worth buying,"I didn't enjoy anything about this cd.It cannot compare in the slightest to the other I found here, the croat zagreb ansamble."
3,over the calf merino wool socks,Please reverse my negative feedback on this order.The seller has made good on the order by sending merino wool socks to replace the cotton socks they'd sent me by mistake.Lionel Gambill
1,Disappointment,This product is fine. I already have several pairs from another vendor. I like them and wanted more. My original vendor dropped the product. I ordered over the calf and got midcalf.
5,Fun and innovative!,"The price is a little steep-- the book is child-sized, meaning it's about seven square inches big-- but boy does it make up for its size in presentation! The flip-transparencies are ingenious, as well as the method for viewing it. My 5 1/2 year old son couldn't put it down. Its language is clear but not dumbed-down. There may be a few vocabulary words that the younger readers will ask about. But honestly, this is a GREAT introduction to human anatomy for this age group-- by far the best one I've seen."
4,"Very good, but incomplete...","My 3 year old wanted to know how food gets to the stomach and beyond (of course). This book serves to explain how food is digested, how 1/2 of the skeleton looks (no feet, mom), and how a baby grows in the mother...but it misses muscles, circulatory system, nervous system and isn't very detailed when it does discuss the five senses. The main attraction of this book is the fascinating paper flash light that seems to illuminate the very good illustrations on transparencies. It is a winner - we just wish it covered more and answered more questions."
2,missing part,"I was disappointed that this book was sold with a missing piece. In order to look at the pictures on some pages there was a pull out ""viewer"" in the back. That viewer was missing from the space it was suppose to be in. The book is not usable without it."
4,great buy!,If your not looking for anything fancy this is great! I have not noticed any inaccuracies. I live it because its not ugly. No complaints here!
1,It's definetley desnt serve the purpose it is intended for.,The product is waste of money. I had to return it within 1 day of the purchase.everytime it displays a different reading for the same object.InconsistentSlow performanceoverall inferior quality product
3,OK for the price,"OK for the price, but not that great. Repeated weighings are not always the same. Also, I have to recalibrate between weighings."
3,It's an average scale..,The scale seems to be pretty accurate.. I do think it is a bit over priced for the quality.. It doesnt do anything special.. It is just an average scale..
1,short life,"This scale only lasted three months! I bought new batteries thinking that was the problem ($11.00 for the required 2), nope!!But it did work well while it lasted!! I liked it.... but now I'm going back to analog!"
5,Rare Red LED Scale,"Not easy to find a red LED bathroom scale. Most scales now sport LCDs that can be hard to read without perfect lighting. This scale is EASY to read. We have used this scale for over 6 months and although I would not trust the decimal part of the reading, in general, the scale seems to provide consistent measurements over time."
1,Scale,This is no doubt the worse product I have ever purchased from Amazon. I would return it or perhaps I should throw in the trash.The weight varies if you step on it within a 10 minute interval enormously. It is horrible.
4,Great figure.,It's not quite what I thought I was getting. I got the yellow/black scheme instead of the blue pictures. Still very good for the price and a nice add on to my collection.
4,Its Cute!,Not as impressive as some of the higher end PVC's but its a good quality and its very inexpensive. maybe a good idea for someone who is new to collecting and is not sure if they know what are.
4,Simple but cool,"This figure is nice, very simple but nice. The only thing that I hate is the 'Comic Con' logo in her top. Anyway, It's a very nice cheap figure!"
2,"Quite imitable jeeves, Not best of Wodehouse","Write this on my tombstone ""He read and reread every word that P. G. Wodehouse ever wrote."" I am in the process of reading Wodehouse books. On a second reading of this book, it pains me to write that this (same goes for Thank you, Jeeves) is not best in the Jeeves series. Inimitable Jeeves is pretty good till chapter 13 but then it seems the great PG just phoned the rest in - all the betting on sermons, village fair races, oye ve!By wodehousian standards, I gave only two stars but if the author was someone else, say Tom Sharp, I would have given 3 or 4 stars."
1,Wodehouse at his worst,"I was very disappointed with this book. This book does no justice to the Jeeves line of stories. It is disjointed, and not in the least bit funny. If you really want to see Wodehouse at his best, I would recommend ""Thank You Jeeves"". Anybody who reads this book will be off Wodehouse for life, that's for sure."
3,Jeeves,Found cover unattractive and print hard to read.Service fast and efficient. Wish it was in the standard format.Gave away.
5,Shoot out at the Wash-O-Mat,"A Shoot out at the Shiprock Wash-O-Mat leads to a puzzle that only Jim Chee with his knowledge of the Ghostway and of death rituals can try to peace together. Related is a disappearance of a school girl (Margaret Sosi) will lead Jim from the New Mexico landscape to the Los Angeles area. There with Hillerman's gift for description we also get a contrasting look of the different worlds. Will He find the girl and what does the puzzle spell out, or will it ever become clear?This is a close continuation of ""People of Darkness"" so many of the descriptions and people were previously defined in that book. The reason people read Hillerman is mostly for the descriptions of the places and people his characters encounter. As seen in previous books, in the description of Margaret and other characters, he incorporates his real life experience with World War II and its aftermath."
4,Helps keep you organized,"I would recommend this. In fact, I am about to order a second of these. It helps sort the jars and lets you know what you are about to run out of. I am ordering a second now that our baby is eating more different types. (I am planning on having one for fruits and juices and one for vegetables.) It does not feel solid when you take it out of the box but once you snap it together (which is a cinch) it works well and is appropriately sturdy."
3,Doesnt turn well,"I like the fact that I can use this to put my baby food on, however with the weight, its hard to turn and see all the food that is there."
2,Have a lot of room?,"I thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in, but really, it took up too much counter space. I ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as I personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary, I found. Save your money!"
2,"Maybe good in the past, but not now!","This WOULD be a great space-saver . . . but now that Gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars, we never used it AT ALL!! Now Gerber makes their own Feeding Center to accommodate their tubs, and I LOVE it!"
1,Life is Too Short,"I always buy books with dustjackets, but mistakenly bought one without, so that's my fault. (I'm only using the book as reference not collection.) Still, the book reeks of cigarette smoke."
4,Very interesting,This is the only book I've ever read about Mickey Rooney and it was very interesting. He doesn't hold much back. Good read if you are interested in stars of that era.
3,"Ok, but","Boy, this ended up being another Wicca 101 book. I was really hoping for more from Kate, and I ended up being very disappointed. I belong to a Trad that is not caught up in Dogma and nonsense, although we definitely have our rules and (more of an eclectic trad). I'm a very advanced practitioner of the craft, and this book did very little for me, especially in the way of spellcrafting and ritual writing (been there...done that). Spellcrafting and ritual writing is VERY personal and should not be constrained to ""rules"" ... if you have the need and the intent, you have the basis for a spell or ritual. I would love to see someone publish a book on growth in the craft, more on ethics of the craft and karmic repercussions, and see fewer books on the ""nuts and bolts"" and rulebooks."
1,Too Traditional,I found this book stuffy. Full of one sided rules. Wicca is about diversity to me not dogma. Not very helpfull on forming a pagan group unless you want to crontrol people. I've been a Wiccan for 11yrs and a member of a pagan group. This is not how things should be run at all. BLESSED BE
1,a bit more on the imaginary farie tale witch side,"Reading this book I just didnt feel the spells take the craft seriously. It was a bit on the fairytale side of witch spells. Not for a realistic practing pagan, in my opinion."
4,More than expected.,"It is very good and provides what promess. I did not expect full witch craft with altar and offerings, so It can't really be used unless is by a wicca."
4,Lost Treasures Return,"In miniature format of the original Vanguard vinyl albums, including cardboard and a record sleeve, this collection of beautiful, lyrical works are special treasures, particularly Autumn Song because of the superb support of Walcott, Moore, and McCandless of Oregon, among others. Few recordings of Vasant Rai were made because of his early death. He had a strong sense of melody, and his sarod playing was refined, smooth, and confident. Rai also played flute and guitar on these sessions. Whereas Spring Flowers (1976) is more tentative and jam-like, Autumn Song (1978) was more like a polished gathering of dhuns, light classical or folk tunes; it was a successful pioneering work of fusion by recognized artists well versed in each other's musical idiom. Joy and peace are conveyed in these now historic recordings."
5,awesome,"this was one of the most amazing albums I ever got. If any one has more information about Vasant Rai, I would love to know more about him. Where is he now? any other albums?"
3,Swamp Ordinaire,"I enjoy Tab Benoit's music, but at the end of the day it's not very ambitious or extraordinary. Well crafted and delivered with some good backing musicians. If you like Benoit, you'll enjoy this album."
1,Terrible . . . do NOT buy!,"Redhead Sockeye is NOT sockeye salmon!The salmon is mushy, has a bad taste, is verylight pink in color, very salty, and is inedible.It is so bad that I wouldn't give it to anyoneand put all eleven unopened can in the trash!I recommend Trader Joe's sockeye, which isdelicious and costs less than 1/2 the price of thisbad tasting, mushy salmon. JD"
1,"Too salty, tastes lousy","Ordered a few cases. It's barely edible. Too salty. I may have to donate it to the homeless. Can't eat it anymore. Shame on them for poor quality control. Only a lousy company has to overdo the salt in an unhealthy, despicable attempt to make it more palatable. No honor in that!! They overdo the food dye too. I smell at rat in the corporate management -- heavily pushing the dye and salt. Shameful!"
5,An amazing attention!,I enjoyed your salmon!!! Besides being healthy it's very tasty. Really delicious. Yum!!!I also take the opportunity to say the work you do is very interesting . It is good and rare to see people comitted with healthy and natural life style.Thanks for the postcard and your touching message.
5,Delicious - Healthy - Convenient,"I love both varieties, Redhead and Thinkpink. Both are delicious straight out of the can. Redhead even reminds me the freshly caught salmon that I ate in Finland. It's more rich. While Thinkpink is to me like some superior version of tuna. I keep recommending the salmon and the company to my friends. I've never had better tasting canned salmon!"
3,decent price,decent price but a lighter gauge wire than I thought it would be. appropriate for home use but not for protection training.
3,Buyer beware,"A great cast in a so-so movie. However, it is fun to watch the cast chew through the scenery with obvious relish. They are having much too much fun for this to taken too seriously.But beware, the wide screen version isn't!"
3,Could Have Been Better!,"This is a decent movie with some high profile lead actors. However, Barbara Kellerman does not impress as the female lead. Her acting is wooden, expressionless, and amateurish in my opinion. I can't believe they couldn't have done better.One aspect that knocks a star off of my rating is the fact that they didn't bother to give the actors haircuts that were appropriate to the WWII period. Also, the clothing is not period-accurate as well. In fact, you have to keep reminding yourself this is supposed to be in the 40's rather than 1980! This does detract quite a bit, and there are other odds and ends that show the lack of detail given to this picture. Too bad, since the top-name actors and interesting, true-to-life plot make this a worthwhile movie otherwise!"
4,what you would expect from an 80s film,"It brought me back to a time when sets were real, and not all computer generated. there was a silly plot line. If you liked the old 70s and 80s WWII films this is one that you should atleast see. I don't think that I will watch it again though, but it was not a waste of time."
3,Good Movie for WWII history,"Based on historical fact, the movie provides a realistic portral of the raid to destroy German spy ships. Would recommend for WWII movie history buffs"
5,This was a very good movie,The actors were very good as well as the story line. I think it was a wonderful movie. Keep up the good work.
4,The Sea Wolves,"A fine old Flick which, until I purchased this, I didn't own.I've just been informed my Review required eight (8) more words."
3,The movie is OK.,"I enjoy naval movies so I thought, ""What the heck, why not?"" I would not say I wasted the money spent, but I don't expect I'll be viewing this movie a second time."
2,The Sea Wolves,"The Sea Wolves is not the best of war movies. The most interesting part is a few periscope shots of ship sinkings. It is a story about some ancient warriors from the Crimean campaign who go together for an improbably operation against a Nazi spy ship in India. It is worth watching, I guess, but if you miss it your understanding of the events in World War II will not suffer."
4,The Sea Wolves,Its a good story well played out by the actors of little known war actions in the Indian Ocean Theater during WW2. Besides drama and action humor tends to help in getting thru what at times are dull periods in the film. Its great for WW2 fans.
3,Sea Fair,"This beloved WWII saga is fairly irresistible, even if it's never quit as good as you want it to be. The first half is some flavorful, if slow moving, cloak-and-dagger spy stuff in wartime India. Then we get to the Sea Wolves tale of golden oldies doing their part for the war effort, and the tone becomes agreeably rousing.Peck tries, and he's likable if simply not convincing. Always lackadaisical Moore isn't helped by his character being so foolish. For the final scenes you're on the edge of your seat, not just in suspense, but as you worry about frail David Niven taking a fall.Not a classic, but fun."
3,A cute little film,"If there is any such thing as a ""sweet"" war movie, this is it. The violence is about on par with a '50s western (I would let me 7 year old Godson watch this movie), and it's impossible not to like the cast.One note: Roger Moore may be the most careless spy in history."
3,Frustrating Sound Mix,"One has to really crank up the volume to hear the dialogue.....rather frustrating to say the least. The movie is OK; Peck is great as usual...Niven is fine, and Roger Moore is annoying as always....The location photography is great, and it is actually the best thing about the movie...don't pay a lot for this disc. If you do, you'll be unhappy."
3,Gregory Peck and David Niven,"These two actors were in one of my favorite movies: The Guns of Navarone. Maybe seeing them in that movie spoiled me - and there was no way The Sea Wolves could measure up. Sea Wolves' plot was nowhere near as good - nor was anything else, for that matter. IMHO, adding the suave Roger Moore didn't help this movie - he was more of a distraction than anything. Same same for the ""Mrs. Cromwell"" character."
4,You're never too old to be a hero...,"This is a great action flick of WWII without relying on car chases and explosions, (until later). The fact that it is based on facts make it all the more interesting. I will have to admit that my OCD did affect the movie a little. Those of you who have served in the military, and a few others, will know what a ""Gig Line"" is. These are former military professionals, some officers and BRITISH at that! The significance is this, no career military man, no officer, no British officer!! whether civilian clothes or not, would be seen in public with such a crooked Gig Line as David Niven has in this movie.That's it. My only criticism but it stuck in my head and I can't get it out."
5,war movies,"this is a great movie and about true story, great actor , great movies, about hard times ,in great setting"
2,Story good -- art direction terrible,"Story and acting were great. Loved the development of the plot.Art direction: costumes, hair, make-up were all late 70's/early 80's in style. In the opening shot, I was wondering if this would be a flashback movie with the big-named actors only bookending the real movie--I was wrong. Every lapel was the wrong size. Dresses were not 40's, but 80's. Men's haircuts were wrong. They were blow-dried--how anachronistic. Even the mustaches were the wrong size for the era. It sort of felt like a Magnum PI or the A-Team episode."
2,Just Awful,"This movie has a great cast (all of my favorites), but you can tell from the long hair styles and 70's coloring of the filming that it is a more modern film. It had great potential. Gregory Peck is Gregory Peck. It is hard to not get a great performance out of him, but even he can't hold this film up. Roger Moore looks aged, as well as David Niven and Gregory Peck. It fails to capture the same drama of ""The Guns of Navarone."" The sea attack on the anchored German freighter was hokey and not very believable. Not a bad B-movie, just not really worth more than $5.00 to see it. For free, go ahead and see it!"
3,Old Wolves,"This will sound bad. The stars were too old for the parts in this movie. I know that is terrible but it is true; they were not believable in this movie. Their ages showed in how they walk, talked and fought. Gregory Peck fighting younger men and winning and Roger Moore and a woman young enough to be his daughter ....PLEASE. The three stars are for the truth of the story, not the stars."
2,Cover Art A Bit Deceptive,"The old addage ""dont judge a book by its cover"" applies to the DVD. Most of the images on the DVD case are not even from this film. The shots of Niven and Moore are from a film they did togehter, ""Escape to Athena"". And the modern sub on the back is not in this film......"
1,The Sea Wolves,"I could not wait to receive this movie. I am a classic film lover; especially a good World War II movie. However, this movie left me wanting a whole lot more from it. It had a stellar cast, but the sound track was difficult to hear the actors speaking. The plot really dragged on in the beginning and I was wondering when the movie action would pick up. . . . . and sorry to say, it really did NOT. This could have been a fantastic movie as it is based on a true story. It was sadly dissatisfying for me."
2,dougv,"Slow moving and the plot is boring. Good cast, but the movie is not worthseeing.The title is excellent, but buying the dvd is a waste of money."
1,It's not them,"I am very disappointed with this album. It's noisy, no melody, not diverse, the worst Plaid album. If you want to hear good electronica you'd better buy Not for threes or Rest proof clockwork, those are masterpieces. Spokes is monotonous, it tries to be very different from their latest works, but unfortunately it became nothing but noise."
1,Forget about it!,"I'm a devoted fan of beautiful Maryam D'Abo but this bomb is truly awful. There's no dead guy at the White House, no helicopters flying around, no suspense, no believable premise, no coherent plot, no script at all and, needless to say, no need for you to spend your dough on this cr@p....unless you are a true devoted fan of Maryam D'Abo. GOD, I NEED HELP!"
5,Hilariously bad,"I just saw about an hour of this movie on TV and man is it awful. It was so bad I literally had tears coming out of my eyes from laughing so hard. From what I could gather, an attorney (Corbin Bernsen?) was having an affair. His wife catches him in the act and threatens to shoot him. The gun accidentally discharges, killing his wife, but Bernsen has no clue she's been shot. He keeps screaming something to the effect of ""What's that look for?! What are you trying to tell me?!"" (She's been shot genius) Bernsen and this woman proceed to bury his wife, and it just gets weirder from there.Most of the movie's humor comes from Bernsen's over the top acting as he screams and bumbles his way through the script's cliché dialogue. If you want to laugh, rent this dud of a movie."
1,Waste of 100 minutes,"Wow. Hard to find words to describe this movie. Wow. It was bad. Off the wall plot. Just a little bit far-fetched. The camera man forgot to come in when they filmed this. Seems like they threw up a camera and hoped to catch as much of the movie as possible. Everyone else was grasping but not touching anything, except for eachother. I have to say though, it was bad enough to laugh about."
1,Song,"does anyone know the song that Cedric started break dancing to when he was talkin about gangs in the clubs? it's an old school hiphop, but i can't find it!"
1,The song list,"Monifah (""Na Na"")The O'Jays (""For the Love of Money"")Sticky Fingaz (""Ghetto"")King Floyd (""Groove Me"")Ohio Players (""I Want to Be Free"") - Steve singsFred Wesley & the JB's (""Doin It to Death"")Earth Wind and Fire (""Love's Holiday"") - Steve singsMystikal (""Here I Go"") - Cedric comes out toLenny Williams (""Cause I Love You"") - Steve singsCedric The Entertainer (""Peanut Butter No Jam"" ""Turn Off the Lights"" ""Wedding March"")Afrika Bambaataa (""Looking for the Perfect Beat"") - Cedric is breaking to."
2,Sountrack,"This wasn't a poor soundtrack it just wasn't what I thought it would be. If you want the old school tracks that steve harvey was singing to it's I get so lonely/by:lenny williams, I wanna be free/by:Ohio players, Love's holiday/by:earth,wind&fire."
1,Where's the real music?,"I've just bought the VHS of this - and I thought it was truly excellent AND I could relate to it (even though I'm a person of little 'colour'...).However, I have a big problem with this CD. At the end of the film there's a long list of the cool ""old school"" music referred to in the film. I want to buy the old school music - not bits of comedy from the video. (Nor hip-hop that's barely even in the movie.... friends of Spike's perhaps?)."
3,re on the song name,"the song cedric was danceing too is affrikka bammbatta ""looking for the perfect beat"" :)"
3,No Windows developers,Prospective buyers should know that this book is UNIX-centric and won't benefit Windows developers much. I guess this is reasonable since Open Source is mostly a UNIX phenomenon.
5,Absolutely Terrific,"I have been a subscriber since 1999 and this remains the greatest tribute to North Carolina that I have ever read. The articles are always insightful and engaging and the photographs are outstanding. Thanks to Our State for doing such a wonderful job in depicting the life of North Carolinians and sharing the stories, photos, etc. with us."
5,our state magazine,"This is a great magazine about the attractions and special out of the way places in NC.My family loves to look for the closest locations and make a visit, whether is be diners, flea markets, Main streets of some towns, anything to explore in NC."
5,If you're Celiac and miss convenient meals...,"This product rocks! My favorite is serving it with Amy's GF cheese enchilada's and re-fried beans for a SW meal but it's just as good with a can of chicken and some corn drained and stirred in (add a spoon of butter or EVO oil to help the seasonings spread around). It's tasty, has great texture and one packet makes just the right amount for the two of us."
1,European customers watch out!,This item comes with a US type plug. There's no info that it has it and I had to buy an adapter. Shipping and handling I think is extremely expensive.
1,Hydor Airo2 Red Air Pump,"Had success with the Airo's once prior (without light), but this one came broken. Only one warning: make sure the air inlet pipe is straight up (if drops below level of pump it siphons the water out of the tank!). Light looks great at night behind my amazon sword in my 20 Gallon. They do make a volcano decoration,which is pretty cool."
4,Excellent Introduction to Complex Analysis,"This is a great short introduction to complex analysis. It doesn't cover all of the topics that might be covered in a college course, but the topics it does cover it covers clearly and with many good examples. There are exercises, but not an inordinate amount;just enough to practice what the author is teaching you.I reread this over the summer and I had forgotten how much I like this book. In fact, I wish I owned a copy of it the first time I took complex analysis."
5,Lynley dodd does it again,My daughter loves this book. In the book a little girl fantasizes about her dog turning into something else...a dragon in a wagon...a yak on his back....It is yet another delightful book by Ms. Dodd. Highly recommended.
2,bad waltz dvd,"This is not a good dvd on the waltz, they only give three basic moves and than do a lot of talking. This is truely a waste of money."
1,Very sad,"Poor Libby! Nice of her to want to help other people but this should be 'Coach yourself to Change' rather than Success since Libby points out that she Was a success at Sony, chose to leave, then wrote a book on mens parenting, and now this coaching DVD. She doesnt seem to be doing this because it makes her happy and she presents it as being a big step down for her, not as a success. The Positive: her program does promote Change, which is something. I hope Libby finds Success, but why promote a program that she doesn't present as working well for her? Something to do? I like Dr. Phil, but I feel cheated and misled by this particular self-help program.It is also weird that another viewer/reviewer would attack Talane Miedaner, who wrote just to say ""Do not confuse the DVD with the Book"". I can't see anyone being jealous of Libby. If I had written a book I wouldn't want it confused with Libby's dvd, either."
2,This could be a much better book,"I am currently enrolled in AP Latin Literature and my class has been using this book because it contains the new poems for the AP exam. We've all found the book's notes to be to sparse to be of any real help in translating and the glossary in the back to be seriously lacking. If you are planning on using this text, however, please translate with a good Latin-English dictionary nearby and with plenty of patience. Also note that the Latin text in this book does not have macrons."
3,Works but finish is off.,"The product works fine, however, the case has two dramatically different colors of gold, and the hose is so dark as to hardly be labelled as gold. The looks are not attractive, but the product seems to be well constructed and works as described."
5,Try something new - try this!,"When I first got this cd, I was skeptical. I ordered it because someone recommended it to me, and I was pleasantly surprised. I never thought in a million years I would enjoy Mexican techno/rock, but I love this cd! Each song has it's own personality, but they all will have you grooving along. Sambita especially stands out to me with it's infectious harmonies. Do yourself a favor and get this cd!"
3,Venture out of the norm,"Kinky is good (musically, but lyrically weak), but not as great as all of the reviews they are getting here! There are a lot of better, more original, more real Latin Rock groups out there (e.g. Los Amigos Invisibles, Gustavo Cerati, Orishas, Yerba Buena, etc.). Kinky has just been the beneficiary of a massive marketing campaign that has allowed them to be brought into the gringo mainstream. I challenge you to go beyond the mainstream."
4,rare tracks,This compilation appears out of print which is a pity since I saw a huge stack of these discs a few years ago in a record store. Classic early Mobley here and a decent recording circa 1956.
4,gardening hoe,"this product was just as advertised, very well made. I couldn't find one in my area, that is why I ordered it. Since receiving it I have seen at least 3 in various stores that were the same price and I would not have had to pay shipping, so I paid about double for it. The stores I saw it in were not your usual stores for tools (Home Depot, etc.). I saw it in Marshalls, TJ Max, etc. Stores you would not usually associate with tools."
1,Not like the picture,"Perhaps my stroller isn't the ""standard""; I'm not sure but it is not easy to use as pictured. The mosquito netting is a complete waste. It just doesn't stay in place and hangs awkwardly since every stroller is different. I am going to use the sunshades; my baby liked not having sun in his eyes, but I'm just going to buy snaps from the craft store and sew them on so they can snap directly onto the stroller."
1,"BabyShade Stroller Cover Protects Infants in Canopied Strollers from Sun, Rain, Wind and Flying Insects","I bought this cover for my 10 month old baby, basic problem is that cover is non transparent so baby feels claustrophobic inside.Don't buy this product, I wasted good 27 dollars on it."
5,Good read,Interesting perspective of the Rwandan genocide. Gives a personal touch to the aftermath of the conflict. Enjoyed the sequence of the panels as well going between present and past.
1,Get this book on Kindle if you want to Dispair,"This review is devoted exclusively to the Kindle edition, which is literally broken. It costs 2 1/2 times the price of the other Kindle edition, which is only modest as most Kindle editions go, but by comparing it with a hard copy from Princeton, I am assured that it has the complete text. This edition seems at the very least to have radically broken pagination. The Preface (written by Kierkegaard) is missing, and it seems as if much of the Introduction is missing. What would normally be on one page is often smeared across a dozen or more pages. The Kindle Edition, taken from a Penguin paper edition, is plainly broken. Buy the $1.99 edition. It ain't great, but its readable."
1,Crap kindle edition I'm not happy with Penguin Classic,"I can't adequately review this book since the whole edition is disconnected, partial paragraphs that finish on the second page. This edition for the kindle makes me miss the physical form of the book."
1,misleading title,"The title says ""Tom's of Maine Anticavity Fluoride Toothpaste - Peppermint Baking Soda 6 Oz. (Pack of 3)"" but was only sent a single tube of toothpaste."
4,Cleans stains,"Peppermint covers MOST of the baking soda (but not all) and no artificial sweetner to make your mouth feel funny. The essential oils leave you breath sweet and fresh. Cleans stains, but I don't like baking soda in toothpaste, myself."
3,inspirational,i really like the ideas they have in this magazine but i wish there was more in depth information on the creative process.
1,How can you live with yourself with all the lies?,"I read the Vampire book and all I can say is you really lied alot. I hope you go back and try to ask for forgiveness from your town, because they are all laughing at you right now. Nobody called you a freak, the town did everything they could to help you and you put a knife in there backs. Tammy Evans, What do you tell your children? I am all for talking about a health issue, but not on the backs of other people."
1,"Eastern Side Review. ""Sharon"" was the hero","""Sharon"" was the hero of Porphyria, I wanted to know moreabout her. She was a good friend to the author, and whathappened after the three of you walked under the arch? The ending left me hanging. I believe the author should have spent alot more time on the plot of Trek-For-Truth, and talked more on the characters and less on Tammy's whining. I take it that the author was to be the strong one, but it turned out that Sharon was. The author should have spent more time on the writing of this book. This book is not going to be a bestseller, for two simple reasons, ""vampire,"" and poor writing."
2,Fact or fiction?,I feel that this book is more fiction than fact. Knowing what I know about Porphyia I feel that this author over used her imagination. This is not true in todays medicine. I feel that Tammy felt that she had to make excitment for her readers. She could have spoken of the truth and the book would have excelled. Better luck with fairy tales Tammy.
1,I wanted to know more about sharon.,"The book did not hold my attention, but I really liked Sharon. I would like to met her someday. I hope she reads this and writes an online review about herself. I sent her an email, but did not get a responce. Come on Sharon the people want to hear more from you."
1,"THIS BOOK IS REALLY BAD,BAD,BAD,BAD>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>","ONE BAD BOOK, DON'T WRITE ANYMORE...PLEASE........"
5,Brand new thinking about timeless astronomical issues,"Tom Van Flandern's book adds a new dimension to cosmology--not only does it present a novel approach to timeless issues, it stands up to the closest scientific scrutiny. The author has a proven track record and top notch credentials, so when he begins his hard-hitting critique of the status quo it's a breathtaking read, for laymen and scientists alike. Let's be honest about the Big Bang Theory--even the most respected scientists today will readily admit it is full of holes. But it takes a new look, like Tom Van Flandern's book, to explain not only why the theory is wrong but what to substitute in its place. This is a significant book and if you read it you will get a thrill just as those who read Copernicus and Galileo must have gotten a thrill to realize they were reading about the future of science. Read it--you won't be disappointed."
5,Just what I needed,Great product from trend enterprises at a lower price than trend. No issues at all. 100% brand new in box and shipped fast!
1,El stinko,"Was not impressed - couldn't even get through the second chapter. I read the reviews of others that read the book and I thought it was something that my wife and I could use. It did accomplish one thing, we laughed and giggled at the way the book was written - big letters and all."
2,Vicious cycle,"I've been operating on a diet of sex for some time now, so it's no surprise that I'm irritated by this author's claiming it as her own discovery. Am I obliged to credit this author for the many pounds I've shed since I began my substitution program?Also, I can't help feeling that the ones who really need help are the ones being left out. A sex diet is all very well for those attractive enough to get plenty of it, but how about those who struggle to find willing partners? How can the morbidly obese expect to get enough sex to take the place of their food intake? If anything, they would need MORE than the average person..."
2,LET ME TELL YOU,"The style of the book is nearly comical. Yes, wait now, i need more sex... today. I got more pounds this week"
3,"Not for those with low libido, self-esteem or conservative humor","Bought it for my wife, who keeps on talking about dieting, as a potentially fun and enjoyable way to augment her ideas about dieting? She didn't get past the cover and first page before it ended up on the pile of unread books and magazines. Too bad I found it a fun & sexy read, and while you may not really loose weight, if you try out the ideas inside I don't think either you or your partner would care as you'd be having too much fun with each other. I mean what husband wouldn't be more than happy to help his wife with a diet like this."
4,Enjoyable,"I liked the book and found the information helpful to couples. It is also a good read if you are single and looking to improve your relationship skills. I didn't like that fact that the positions are only described, even stick figures could help some of us who are more visual. Still a good book."
4,Exploring Pagan Christianity,"A friend metioned this book to me.The book is well docutmented, although the footnotes are so small that they are hard for me to read without magnification.The theology assumes a primarily Protestant or Catholic background. If one is of a Sabbatarian (Sabbath on the seventh day which is Saturday) background and especially of a background of Sabbath and Holy Day observance, some of the points made in the book do not seem applicable but for the most part, the book is applicable to all ""Christianity."""
1,Horrible Book,"It's not a book that I could recommend. I've read quite a few books on the subject, but this one is the worst, which I have personally read. With some books, the reader can appreciate the analysis, while disagreeing with the conclusions. With this work, I couldn't even do this, because the analysis was deeply flawed. Please, if you want to explore this topic, buy a different book. Don't support such poor scholarship!"
3,Baby with the Bath Water,This book gets a lot right so I highly recommend it but with caution. The historical homework is excellent but the application requires caution. The weeknesses seem to be: rigid rejection of most church leadership and the means to selectively support them. There also seems to be a lack of appreciation of the creeds. While one may be uncomfortable with the wooden use of creeds they can provide a useful distillation of the corporate understanding of the Church.Amen to the premise that the church needs ecclisiological reformation.
1,Pagan Christianity: Exploring the Roots of our Church Practices,"The book's theme is that today's church government, forms of worship and practice have been taken from the pagan world rather than from the church as it is portrayed in the New Testament. When New Nestament Christians worshipped in the informal setting of a house and without professional clergy each person had an opportunity to use his or her spiritual gifts. The book has left me dissatisfied with current church practice, but I am wondering how today's church can recapture the New Testament church."
4,This book really makes you think,"Be careful, it will shake your religious habits. Contains lots of interesting information about church history. But it is necessary to check other sources as well. In some cases, I don't quite agree on the writers' conclusions."
1,"""WORDS IN RED""","TO ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS:IN SHORT, I BELIEVE THE REAL PROOFTEXTING IS FOUND IN INSTITUTIONALISM - READ THE WORDS IN RED - JESUS THE MESSIAH RESTORED INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND OPPOSED ALL FORMS OF INSTITUTIONALISM; OTHERWISE HE WOULD'VE SET UP HIS KINGDOM ON EARTH. INSTITUTIONALISM NAILED HIM TO THE CROSS!THE GREATEST COMMANDMENT..."
2,Puzzling?,"This is a pretty shameless attempt by the authors to justify their own agenda by trying to denegrate the practices of other churches. Most Christians are aware that the Catholic and Orthodox Churches adapted a lot of early pagan holidays and holiday rituals to help the people transition from pagan religions to christianity. They advise rejecting any such practices in the Church today.They base their own ideas of what our church services should be on a very peculiar interpretation of a few verses in 1 Corinthians, chapter 14. And yet this practice, they call ""proof texting"", which they roundly condemn in others, is exactly what the authors are doing themselves. Taking a few verses from the New Testament out of context, and fleshing out their entire theology. Most reader's will see this for what it is, and attach very little weight to it."
1,Heresy,This book stands in the path of heretics. As a church I do not believe we have moved in the right direction but the lack of understanding of the church fathers by the authors is a damage to the church. Some of the quotations from the bible are literal and others are misconceived and mis quoted by the authors. This is a PAGAN practice. These authors have been hurt by the church and need to learn to forgive others is what they need to do. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK unless You want to BE LEAD ASTRAY!!!!
1,Pass on this one,"This is one of the worst written, agenda driven, criticisms of the Body of Christ I have seen. The authors managed to criticize about every church practice, movement of God throughout Church history and church leader including many of the Reformers, Wesley, Moody, Finney, Billy Graham and others.Fortunately for all of us who have been deceived and led astray for 2,000 years, we now have the ""house church"" to lead the way. No thanks.Amazon, can I get my money back?"
1,Bait and Switch,"I traveled miles to buy the book because the title intrigues me. I love learning about why we do what we do--and how we can be more Biblical in our faith.This book however, should be titled, ""Why the Home Church is Better Than the Institutional Church.""The author(s) speak against proof-texting while applying the art throughout the book--particularly with the constant usage of 1 Corinthians 14.They make statements like ""This is exactly how the first-century Christians worshipped, by the way"" (page 167) without any support whatsoever.Terribly disappointing!"
5,A must for every Christian,This book will set the Christian church straightregarding the origins and history of contemporarychurch practices and worship liturgies which openlycontradict the model given in the New Testament.
5,Revealed,"One of the most lagest revelations one can experiance. Frank hits key points on the traditions of church history. Though it repeats some of the same issue, it is a great read."
4,Learning so much,"A book full of respect for christians and churches, yet also full of explanations for some of the most visible Protestant traditions. I love the way the authors introduce the book and let readers know that the book will be full of facts that may be uncomfortable for church-loving Christians. I agree with the authors that this is essential reading for all christians. Maybe there would be less strife in the world if there was more required reading for religious adherents."
5,Never Be The Same,"Look at all the other reviews. Look at the book. Look at God's word! It's obvious what need to happen. Th Living Christ needs His rightful place in our midst. His complete headship. Why do so many local bodies of believers look crippled spiritually? They are not crippled, they just think we are a small business and those concepts will apply to us. So many people have so many gifts and we accept the way we do it on Sunday and it has no New Testament basis. Christ The Revolutionary wants His bride to himself. A new believer as of 2000 I am. A heart for orphans and widows. A heart for my wife and sons. A heart for The Living God. This book has shown me how to pursue God, show others to pursue Him and to never settle for man's tradition over The Manifested Jesus Christ. This facts and history in this book shook every thing to pieces in my faith except the thing that holds all things together...My Foundation... The Risen Christ! Thanks Frank. **mArC**"
2,"Pagan Pagan, who's got the Pagan?","Those who've made any study of the history of Christianity have pretty well come across the notions in the basic premis of the the book. Alas, this book doesn't really add to understanding progressive Christianity. Viola has a clear agenda based on his personal approach to practicing his Christian beliefs. My question regarding the Pagan elements/influences in Christianity is, ""So what?"". If anything it shows that Christianity was, once in it's growth, a religion that was responsive to the needs and culture it grew in. Alas, for the past 500 years the Christian missionaries haven't responded and recoginzed the value of the cultures they meet, but instead have fostered a percieved need for the cultures to bend to the will of the missionaries; to change their culture to be consonant with how things are supposed to be, from the missionaries' point of view."
5,Amazing Book!,"This book confirms so much of what we've been feeling for a long time! It's incredible to see this reality taking shape in our area. Thanks Frank! The body of Christ needed this! Keep 'em coming, bro!"
4,Christian Origins Search.,"The book is informative and informational,though lacks depth.Overall,I am content."
1,Pagan,"This book was a waste of money. The authors could have said it all in one paragraph, we believe house churches are the real way to do church and everything else is wrong. And I don't really touch the arrogant way it is written. Writers that write about topics like this and then show no humility make it difficult to read or hear what they have to say. I mean for crying it loud the last I knew Barna was a member at Saddle Back or one of the other mega-churches and here he is now pushing house churches. Dressing up for church, pulpits, tithing, buildings, preaching etc. You name it they are the experts. I mean most mainline churches don't demand anyone dress up anymore. This was some great example of being in touch with reality. I have read lots of historical writers and if I had to say read something to explain history I would recommend N.T Wright or someone like that. George please stick to "" the survey says' type books."
1,Distrust Content,"The author finds many things wrong with the church, and some validly so. However, he offers no viable alternative. The model he does suggest offers more problems than in the church. I think that this book can be detrimental to the faith of almost any Christian who desires that his life count for the glory of God. It offers plenty of information to the person who only wants to serve as a critic of the church and do nothing profitable for God."
1,Deceiving,"Short and Simple:I thought this book was interesting and it definitely made me think. I agree with some points made. However, I would highly recommend most people to NOT read this book. This is especially for those who do not have a solid understanding of Scripture. This book is definitely a danger to any new believer for it's poor use of Scripture and history. It also makes claims that are ""reaching"" and have no biblical basis either. The book seems to state that the church shouldn't have a clear structure to it, but here's the structure you should use. It is often contradictory.Kind of irrelevant, but the author's use of exclamation marks is ridiculous and made me want to punch someone! They were out of place and overused!!!!"
2,overboard,"Although I understand the author's reasoning behind this book I think he generally finds just about any way possible to denigrade the church of Jesus Christ which is, after all, the church, the assembly of the elect, IS the bride of christ, NONE are perfect and we all find ways to criticize, which mr viola has done to new heigths. The church does have problems because imperfect people are in the church, but to complain about everything for the sake of complaining means, in my view, mr viola needs to get a life."
5,It has changed my life and view of the church traditions,"Since my first reading of Pagan Christianity, I have and continue to recommend it to anyone who is willing to listen. Pagan Christianity gives a concise and condensed history of the church to show how pagan practices seeped into our church traditions. I was shocked to learn just the enormity of the normal church life, function, appearance comes from sources that are less than Biblical.It has changes my life, my view of the normal Christian church, and my theology on church as a whole!"
1,Some good points. Poor delivery.,"The author makes some decent points, but you have to sift through a lot of words, bad examples, and shotgun style writing (shoot at everything without really developing his own idea). I think some of his criticisms are needed, but his back-to-the-roots house church is really just another form - complete with music, sharing, teaching... I am not saying this is bad - God uses our own culture/interests/structures/styles to reach us. I am also not against the house church movement and think it is cool that God is moving among his people in this way - but I also do not think everyone should abandon the more traditional movements. I happen to find a lot of life in a larger church gathering - through teaching of the word, dynamic small groups, the larger pool of resources to partner with my community..."
5,God bless Frank Viola!!!,"I applaud Frank Viola for doing the research and releasing this book to all of us...the Body of Christ! It is controversial...it contains the TRUTH...If you truly love and seek TRUTH then this book is for you. I sat in ""traditional"" church for years, wrestling inwardly and knowing that there must be more, that something wasn't quite right...i would leave the ""traditional"" church--at the Lord's leading I might add and then be drawn back after much heaping on of guilt and condemnation (not from God) from my peers and leadership...tagged w/ a rebellious streak. ""God would not lead you away from the church!"" they would say.Until ONE day...I got my hands on this BOOK!! I knew it was from the Lord...It confirmed to me that I had been hearing from the Lord all these years!! Such peace!! I was set free.Why do we cling to hollow ""traditions""? Forms of godliness but denying the power!Read this book!"
5,PAGAN CHRISTIANITY?,"This book addresses many questions about todays regilious practices that many people have and why there is so many different afformations. While we do the same thing week after week many of us just do things because ""That is the way we have always done it"". Thank you Frank Viola and George Barna for providing information that shows how far we have strayed from the first centry church. I think all regilious leaders should read this book with an open mind.Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices"
3,1001 ways to say the same thing...,"I really think some of the observations in this book are great...for someone who's been living in an isolated cave for several decades and has no awareness of the technological changes that have occurred in the world. First, the book was EXCEEDINGLY repetitive. Every point Friedman said needed to be restated, rephrased and re-explained about 20 times in unnecessarily lengthy sentences. Furthermore, the book is filled with name-dropping and ranting.Aside from its redundancy and soap-box-like agenda, the book also seems to give the impression that India and China are on the fast track to replacing the US and the west in all respects. He virtually ignores the fact that the vast majority of the populations of both countries live in extreme poverty with little chance of escape for either them or their children.I think the book would have been better summarized into a 2-page magazine article, or even better, a short newspaper column."
5,The History of Christianity made plain,"I have been a Christian all my life, but have had doubts about some of its methods. Sure enough, Pagan Christianity, cleared up some of those doubts but I still believe that ""Jesus died for my sins."" What I read is what is going on today in ministry and music, the culture of the world has invaded the 21st century Church. What I could say in another way is, ""the Church has looked across at the Jones' house, and thought that the grass looked greener over there. So, here we go again. We must be like them. I enjoyed the book. The person that suggested that I read it said that it made him mad. Not me, even though some of the eye-openers for me, or confirmations are not an issue if they are done in the right spirit."
4,Eye opening for sure!,"I really enjoyed this book. It simply is a history book in a way. You will discover why we do ""church"" the way we do. This book did not make me quit my church, but rather understand why many of the same problems seem to be evident in most churches today. This book was not anti-church as some that have read it thinks that it is. It is pro church. God's church is over all the world...it is the believers, the born again in Jesus Christ. The people are the church, not the building. I would recommend this highly."
1,Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices,Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church PracticesThis book did confront the pagan rituals but it also had a lot of its own paganism to it.
1,Poor Attempt At A Needed Study,"I was quite disappointed in this text. I read the first quarter of the book and skimmed an additional chapter, but found the writing to be unengaging and the subject matter quite shallow.Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church PracticesI was ready to like this text having observed the results of Barna surveys and having interacted with Viola on twitter, but I found it to be a poor execution of the stated attempt to show the roots of much Christian practice and buttress the cause of the Western house church movement.The arguments were weak, the content was shallow and the writing was unimaginative.Even at the current price of one dollar I do not recommend this book."
5,Thought provoking,I am really enjoying the historial look at where church traditions come from. The authors' focus seems to be informing followers of Christ so they can make decisions about how best to grow in their relationship with the Lord and the importance of discipleship in a community of believers.
3,Interesting Read,"I enjoyed this book and found it well researched. I have to say that at least 50% of the points made in the book, I had already learned from Jehovah's Witnesses years ago, especially the non Biblical origin of a clergy laity class, honorific titles, tithing, etc."
2,stringing pearls,"Despite some good thoughts on tradition vs scriptural dirrectives, this book is clearly written to support a house-church agenda. The authors site verses that support their line of thinking while ignoring verses that do not.Also, this new brand of Christianity focuses only on the NT and forgets that Jesus himself taught that he did not come to abolish the law and the prophets but to fulfill them."
5,Not for the faint of heart,"I loved the book, but reading it (I stopped only to eat and sleep) from cover to cover was a little like giving birth in all it's grit and glory with no medication for discomfort. And there was major discomfort !This book is not for sissies or the faint at heart. But for the pioneer who is willing to ""go for broke"" in search of the promised land, this book may be the catalyst to help you take that first step. By the end of the book I had jumped off the cliff. I am still a bit stunned, but in a good way. I think.I am waiting for the next book, Reimagining Church, to come in the mail.The only thing I know about church right now is that I have yet to experience it the way it was meant to be. I am more in love with Jesus than ever and for the first time in many years, I feel that I can truly approach Him, as a child, and really hear His voice.Thanks, Mr. Viola, for having the courage to research and write this book."
5,Excellent Exposure of Apostasy in Your Church,"I am the publisher of James Russell Publishing.com and the author of ""The Lost Gospel of John"". I do not publish this book, but the book ""Pagan Christianity"" is an excellent ""in-your-face"" exposure of the great apostasy taking place in 99.999 protestant churches. No beating around the bush. The authors are directly to the point and back up all their claims with solid historical and biblical evidence. It is powerfully written, brutally truthful and is terribly relevant today in these last days. The book is so truthful it is scary to read, but Jesus promised ""the truth will set you free"" and for this reason I highly and strongly recommend every churchgoer read this book to be set free from those trusted hirelings who are obviously unbiblically oppressing and controlling them without them even realizing it. This book is a powerful collection of easy to read wisdom. Any Christian who refuses to read this book will one day wish they had!"
4,Great history,"I agree with many of the other reviewers that he pushes the ""Pagan"" button too many times. I really liked the book but Frank keeps insinuating that Pagan then is Pagan now. Not so. The textual references are very accurate as to how modern day preachers (only 99.99%) of them operate. Set up the problem Sunday morning and then quote out of context scripture to deal with it for that session and the one at night. Same old-same old. The only thing I find lacking is more direction on how to free oneself from all this history and tradition. Anyone can nail this down but where are the solutions out of this modern day tradition. how about raising of children ? how does this translate into their education into the Bible and Church. Well ---all for another day or book."
4,worth reading if you're concerned about the state of the church,"for sure you won't be able to walk into church the same way again; and you'll start questioning all sorts of things & become a better thinker about the church. i think it explains a lotthought there was some sloppy reasoning; can't say they addressed every concern in their arguments.sometimes repetitivesometimes talked about things that didn't really matter, or failed to make a good argument for why some things were being discussed (church steeples, for example)"
4,good insights,"Lots of thot provoking good insights. Another that should be in all Christian library's. Frank has done his homework and hats off to the publisher for the brave move. Viola has studied church history and makes great observations but in my opinion, occasionally pushes scripture too far to validate said points, but to write off the whole book for a couple of instances of rigidity would be a big mistake."
3,Gets you thinking,"Hey, the author makes some strong points and unless you get the paperback version you cannot easily move back and forth to check out his footnotes. Some comments are so strong (not bad...just strong) that I immediately wanted to check his sources but as an e-book, that proved a bit difficult. Suffice it to say that if you have ever asked questions about similarities you have experienced in worship (albeit different denominations) , this book will either answer those questions for you or get you thinking. More than anything, the question you will be left with is am I where the Lord wants me."
2,Too harsh,"While it is very good to re-evaluate at times and make sure we are all still on the right track and didn't lose ourselves in unhealthy traditions and such, the way Viola and Barna present the matter here is degrading and disrespectful. Some of the questions that they raise seem to come from personal disappointments and negative experiences. The overall tone of the book doesn't serve but scolds the body of Christ in a unnecessary way."
2,Not What Expected,"This book was really a big disappointment to me because the responses of the contributors are so heavy with political and social commentary. I was hoping to read how those areas (Latin America, Africa, Asia)interpret certain Bible passages but so much ""third-world"" rantings was brought into it that it appeared more like a text on sociology. Really, a very disappointing book."
2,Barely scratcehs the surface,"Not sure why but I expected more from this.I was already aware of most of what the authors had to say on the Pagan origins of many Christian machinations, and sadly the authors ignored or overlooked MANY Cult of Mithras origined practises.Also, this was written from a decidedly Christian slant, and for some reason that irritated me. I had expected more objectivity given the subject matter, but in fairness that is a presumption I brought in with me, and shouldnt be held against the authors"
4,Good Information But...,"This book has some really good information in it, but there is such a thing as ""too much of a good thing"" I found it almost boring with the redundant questions and answers. This book could have been half the pages and still good. Good read, but very repetitive."
2,Not the book I ordered,"I ordered a book entitled ""On Death and Dying""; I received ""Questions and Answers on Death and Dying""...a supplementary book to ""On Death an Dying""."
5,Some Enchanted Evening is enchanting!,"This album takes you on a stroll down memory lane, enchanting all the way. It is relaxing and soothing listening, and will be great background music for a candlelit dinner for two, an evening party with a mix of ages and backgrounds, or just to sing with while you get some work done. The orchestration is excellent and the performances wonderfully smooth. A hit for everyone!"
2,IT ALWAYS FALLS OFF!!!!,"I have been using this rest for almost 2 years. I started playing when I was 9, in the summer of 2010. This rest has NOT been very cooperative!!! After only 10 minutes of practicing the rest would fall off when ever I would place it on my shoulder. I tried to tighten the rest, lower the rest, and raise it, etc. But nothing helped!!! I would be in my 1 hour lesson and probably 15 minutes of it would be dealing with the rest. The rest has been a real nuisance!!! IT ALWAYS FALLS OFF!!! I am going to try the Wolf Secundo rest and will comment on it when I receive it."
1,not impressed,Ordered this and it looked fine but one of the legs that hold the rest to the viola broke within 3 weeks. Won't be ordering this again from Amazon. Too hard to get a replacement organised.
2,one rubber leg becomes soft and loose after less than one year,"I bought this for my daughter this February. It worked great in the past 10 months. But just recently we found one of the rubber legs becomes soft and loose, and can't gripe the violin securely.I am so dissapointed on the quality of this brand."
3,Compilation,"A compilation of some of Milts's early recordings for Savoy Records 1949-1956 - Tracks 1-3 are quintet tunes with Lucky Thompson on tenor sax and Wade Legge on piano. The group did three more songs available, according to sources, on ROLL EM BAGSMilt plays piano for Frank Wess, Henry Coker and Charlie Fowlkes on track 4 and sings with a different group on track 5Tracks 6-9 are from 1949 and have more of a be-bop flavor to them. Bill Massey, Billy Mitchell and Julius Watkins are the horn players and have at least 1 brief solo apiece"
3,"A Good Concept, but still needs some Improvement","When I saw this listed in the baby products, I thought ""What a great way to take my baby's temperature."" Naturally, though, I wanted to try out the product on myself first before the time came that I would need to use it on my baby. I sucked and sucked and sucked on the digital pacifier (it says sucking must be for atleast 90 seconds), and finally after 4 minutes, the pacifier registered my temperature. Then, I used traditional oral thermometer to compare the results. The digital pacifier registered my temperature 2 degrees lower than the traditional thermometer (not a good sign, in my opinion). Needless to say, I probably will be buying another thermometer (perhaps the 3-way thermometer; can take temperature orally, rectally, or under the arm in less than 5 seconds supposedly) for my baby when the times comes. As mentioned in the title, this digital pacifier thermometer is a great concept, but still needs to be worked on."
3,Disappointed,"This Thermometer seemed like a wonderful idea. Unfortunately, it didn't work as well as I had hoped. I tried this a couple of times when my baby was just a newborn. However, even though the package states 0-5 years this did not work for a newborn. She kept gaging on it because the nipple was too big. I didn't use it for quite some time but recently tried it again now that she is a bit bigger. She is used to a different type of pacifier so she wouldn't keep it in her mouth, which doesn't make for an accurate reading. I will give it this though, it does give me an idea of if I have anything to worry about, I tend to over react and think that she has a temperature, this will do a good enough job to let me know if she is fine or if I need to get out the dreaded ""traditional"" thermometer."
3,"Good thought, but...","I tried this out a few times on my baby, but as a breastfed baby, my daughter really did not care for bottles or pacifiers, so I ended up using a regular thermometer that you can buy at any drugstore for a couple of dollars. It might be wiser to spend the extra money on a toy to entertain your little one while you take the temperature with a regular thermometer."
1,good idea but ...,"the concept is good, but not if your child doesn't take a pacifier. my daughter sucked her thumb so I thought maybe this would work (so I wouldn't have to take it rectally) but she kept spitting it out and sucking her thumb instead. so I just gave up on it. My doctor wouldn't accept this reading anyway so it was a waste of money.(for me anyway."
2,Not For All Babies,"I have a binky thermometer that is a different brand then this one but it works the same. I bought it thinking it was a good way to take my son's temperature, but after trying to use it twice I realize I shouldn't have wasted the money on it. My son is used to latex binkies and the nipple on this thermometer is silicone so he didn't want to keep it in his mouth. It also took about 3 minutes to get a reading, not the 90 seconds the package tells you. You're far better off just getting a [$$$] rectal/oral one at your local pharmacy store."
5,Gillette Complete SkinCare Cleansing Bar,The soap was delivered as ordered and in the time expected. It does not have a strong scent and is good for sensitive skin. I use it for shaving.
4,Greene's most brilliant novel,"Graham Greene has always struck me as an author who took little joy in writing. His short stories are very short, and some of his novels tread the fine line between novel and novella. But what he puts into those brief pages are stunning, and definitely leaves you yearning for more.THE TENTH MAN is probably the one that best exemplifies this feeling. The novel ended so quickly (for me) that I was angry it was over. Not because I felt cheated, but because he had me so taken in by the plot and the tensions created by the choices the characters made, that I wanted it to go on, even just a little longer. But by all means, pick up THE TENTH MAN and just about anything else by Graham Greene."
5,Amazing Return,I needed book for class. Would not arrive in time for a paper due on a friday; book was ordered on tuesday. Seller immediately responded to e-mail and provided full refund in a down to earth way.
4,a once-in-a-lifetime thriller,I found this book very well-written in the sense that you couldn't put it down if you were half way through it. I read it about twelve times in a month .
4,Greene takes a drastic approach to the effects on 1 decision,"I got to read this novel for one of my college courses, and found it to be extremely intriguing in the depth that was used to demonstrate each and every character. He takes the decision of life or death and puts it into a possible situation. The novel kept me interested throughout every chapter. It gave intriguing personalities to each character. Greene wanted his readers to see the impact of what one decision made by one man can do to numerous people. He accomplished this task very well."
4,Great book club discussion,Lots of opinions on the motives of the characters. many themes to discuss. A very good read and short too. Highly recommend for bookclub discusssion.
3,Hard to describe,This is a must see for true film buffs. The pacing can be a bit laborious at times but there are many intellectual treasures to be found here. The ending leaves a lot to be desired but the film is nonetheless thought provoking overall and takes quite a few risks in the way it tells its story. If the pace had been tighter and the ending not so predictable I might have given it a much higher rating. For all its flaws it has some brilliant ideas.
3,Pretty good,"I think this is definately more geared toward the leisure kayaker. At least that is according to my husband. He enjoys the magazine, but for someone who is looking to read more about adventure and class IV's, this isn't exactly where you'll find it. Overall a good mag, but not renewing it based on the adventure aspect."
4,canoe & kayak,"It's okay. I just got my first issue. A lot of Ads and some stories. Great photos. I bought a used canoe two years ago and two new kayaks last year so I'm new to paddle sports and this will get me kick started. I'm not sure how many years I'll subscribe - based on other reviews I read before I bought it, it may become redundant. So far, so good."
1,$599.00???,"This is a shameful disgrace!$599??Astrid and Klaus are loved and respected among Beatles fans for their key role in the development of the early Beatles.But charging said fans this disgraceful price for a story that is, however insider, hardly new to most veteran fans, is unforgivable."
4,Typical Boice!,"The late James Montgomery Boice was a master at bringing scriptural truth to the masses. With the heart of a pastor, he could take high doctrine and relate it to the lives of the average Christian. At the same time he could go head-to-head with any Biblical scholar. His depth and delivery ministered to those who listened to his teaching, whether in the pulpit at 10th Presbyterian in Philadelphia or on the radio. As a note, his radio program, The Bible Study Hour is still broadcast across the county.The Boice Expository Commentary series was not just written by Boice but it ""IS"" James Boice. You can hear him speak through the words of this book and all the books in this series. These commentaries are not academic expositions of scripture but practical expositions with a focus on application. Very pastoral. I love using these commentaries in preparation for teaching small group studies."
5,A commentary you can read...,I have often found commentaries to be long & dry. James Montgomery Boice fills the pages with Bible based truth and insights that are so easy to take away with you. The truths are practical and he makes it clear how they can be applied. I have read a number of his commentaries and look forward to reading others.
5,A compelling look at real-life inner city Los Angeles.,"Corwin gives us the real-life look of policing in the inner city -- not the 30-minute sensationalized ""Cops"" version. The book looks at all the players caught up in crime. Corwin's work on describing the Mexican background of one victim is above and beyond the call of duty. The book moves quickly and stays on focus."
4,"Good, Insightful read","Despite being a few years older this book was exactly what I was looking for and gives a good honest look at the inner workings of a homicide unit along with the tragedies and triumphs that go with it, Its gritty, true, and real... I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in True Crime or Homicide Investigation"
5,book review,"Love this book. Like homicide? Detectives? The A & E Show ""first 48"" ? This is for you then.Well written and exciting while totally real as its about the streets of L.A."
5,THE KILLING SEASON:A SUMMER INSIDE THE LAPD HOMOCIDE DIVISIO,A must read for anybody interested in homocide or detective work. This was a real eye-opener regarding the schedules these incredible people endure. Non-stop action! By the time I finished reading I felt I knew the featured detectives. It is in my library and remains my favorite out of some seventy-plus titles.
2,"Poor cousin to ""Homicide""","From the moment I picked up this book, it felt like a west coast rip-off of David Simon's ""Homicide"" book about Baltimore Homicide detectives. The book itself is not very well written and is full of typos. The detectives aren't very likeable, either. I feel like I've learned more by watching a real-life cop show on A&E than I did by reading this book. Do yourself a favor...stick with the best and the original: David Simon's book."
1,Terrible,This is one of the worst true crime books I have ever read. The book is much more PC than realistic. A much better book is David Simon's Homcide: A Year on the Killing Streets
4,Birthday,This is the story of Lillie and her 11th birthday. Lillie was deathly afraid of cats. What began as a disastrous day turns out happy after all.
4,Pretty and durable,"once i got over being mortified about writing an online review on lingerie, i realized that people ought to be informed about good lingerie as well as good books, appliances, cars, etc.i really like this body stocking. the pattern is really beautiful and this piece can be used as pantyhose under a skirt and a lace cami under a blazer. plus it will make your partner crazy if they know that you're wearing THAT under your demure blazer/skirt combo :)"
1,Very Disappointed!,I bought this for my son for Christmas. He LOVES Max and Ruby. When I got it I was suprised at how small it was. It's a very small and thin tin container. None the less...I wrapped it and put it under the tree. When he opened it he was very excited because it was Max and Ruby. Unfortunately that excitment faded quick when it was opened. It had tiny little thin magnets inside and three PAPER backgrounds. The magnets barely stick to the paper which you have to prop up on the tin container and my son was getting so frustrated with them falling off. It's a junky toy and certainly not worth the $30.00 it cost to get it!
2,Magnets don't stick to paper,"The accessories are magnets, the case is metal, but the backgrounds that you are supposed to arrange the accessories on are paper. Somehow my daughter still enjoys playing with them on a flat, non-moving surface, but I don't understand how they would be good for travel because the magnets slide all over the paper at the lightest touch. Very strange."
5,slim fast core grasp of ASP.NET and C# for the experienced,"I knew Java and ASP for several months, and I had to do ASP.NET with C# at work. This is my first and only DOT NET book so far. This slim book got me into working on ASP.NET in few days. This is NOT for the BEGINNING Programmers. If you have experience in OOP like JAVA and Serverside Web scripting like ASP, you would find this book get you to ASP.NET developing fast. It has real world example and explains core essential things. Just what you need to know to get on the job quickly. You don't spend time on what you already know. It doesn't teach you C# but since I knew Java, it was perfectly ok. For more detailed stuff where I needed, I went to MSDN library. To learn more and deep in certain sections, I'll buy some other books. I am giving 5 stars because it's the only book I read and it did good job for my purpose. Thank you very much!"
5,not just for christmas!! great message and acting.,"i absolutely love this show. it's so touching and has a great message. the acting was really good- billy ray cyrus surprised me. the story is just neat and it gets the message across about being happy with what you have, making the most of tough circumstances and how the best gifts aren't always ones you can buy. i had to buy it to watch it every year. love this movie."
4,Christmas in Canaan,"enjoyed movie,received without a problem, good family movie to be watched any time of the year not just at Christmas time"
5,Christam in Canaan,This was a great movie and a must for all collectors of DVDs. A good family movie for the holiday season.
3,Easy to understand,The text provides easy to follow step by step intructions for becoming proficient in the use of Fireworks. The font was of a large of enough size and the individual intructions were nicely separated in an ordered list. Easy to read and not skip a sentence or paragraph when looking back and forth from screen to text to screen. Very nice skills review and knowledge assessemt at the end of each lesson. The construction of the text as a spiral book allows one to lay it flat on your desk with holding the pages down. A great reference book as well. I recommend it.
3,Digitalism '- The Twelve Inches,"""Idealistic"" has all the rock-electro swagger you care to handle (pretty characteristic of Digitalism's output), replete with Adult.-type vocals. But for their ""Voyage Mix,"" they take it slightly spacier, a bit more club-friendly, while the ""Rampage Mix"" brings forth the percussion and the thrumming. ""Zdarlight"" is much more house-oriented. The ""Moonlight Edition"" introduces some synth-horns into the disco, while the ""Discodrome Edition"" throws in some guitars for good measure, sounding straight out of the 70s. ""Jupiter Room (Martian Assault Mix)"" continues with that disco vein, until it finally runs out."
3,Just a bit repetitive...,"I like Digitalism, I really do.But I do feel like they throw out to many remixes on the same 2 tunes on a single album. I like having variety on an album, and it is lacking on this one. Sure, these mixes are good, but they get repetitive after a while.Buy it if you're a fan and want every album they produce. If you're just curious, go listen to Idealistic and Zdarlight on their Idealism CD first and see if you really like them."
2,Good for the price...,"...but if you want to use this, buy a couple of them. Mine lasted about a month. The problem is the plastic part that holds the phone into the case. It isn't sown very well and therefore rips out. For the price though, it couldn't hurt to buy a few and just toss the broken ones."
4,Pretty,"I got this stationery set to give some variety to my mail which had started to look stale. I admit the antique French look this set goes for is nice and it gives it a warm, not-too-girly vibe.The colors and patterns don't match exactly so it really is a question of you doing the mixing & matching. It always looks good (unless you're purist about that kind of perfection thing in which case, this is not the set for you). Also, I liked that the paper is a good quality and the ivory color looks distinguished and good. The box is great and very elegant and has started to hold some of my treasured letters.The only complaint? I'm into writing long letters (as I'm sure a lot of people who own this are) so 30 sheets and 30 envelopes will just leave me with a lot of envelopes left over long after I use up all the sheets. I'm starting to reserve this for my short letters (almost nonexistent) and thus, this set isn't getting all the use it could.Manufacturers, more sheets than envelopes next time please!"
1,Never got it,I purchased a few items at one time and this was not in the package I received. I found out 24 hours later it would be delivered separately. Then found out 24 hours after that - it was no longer available. Be careful - they may not have it and you might not find out until later.
2,Expected More from Product!,"The cds are ok, but the sounds aren't soothing. After a while, the sounds become tedious to listen to; rather boring experience. Not boring as relaxing and you'll fall asleep, but rather boring as in getting annoyed with the sound."
1,This CD made me nauseous,"From time to time, I have restless nights. I ordered this cd hoping it would help me sleep more deeply. I found the rythms actually made me nauseous and I believe that it disturbed my sleep even further and kept me awake longer rather than sending me off to sleep. I was very disappointed."
2,Man I was wrong about this CD,"Originally this was a bad review. But over the course of the past months this cd has become an absolute favorite of mine. Maybe at first listen it's nothing special. But I think repeat listens help you ""get"" the style of this cd. Girls Aloud did a great job and I am looking forward to their 4th studio album and all future albums as well.The absolute best songs are ""Biology"", ""See the day"", and ""Long Hot Summer"".Admittedly some of the tracks seem half-assed, and coulda had more production put into them, but they are still gems anyways."
3,This is sure different....,"Imagine my happiness when while browsing on Amazon I noticed that Girls Aloud had released a new CD. However, this CD isn't as memorable as the girls' past albums. Most of the lyrics are hard to understand and often overpowered by upbeat dance rhythms. Adding insult to this, there's no lyrics included with the CD (I bought my CD in the US so I'm assuming it's the same in the UK). I've listened to the CD about four times and there's no song that has struck me as a ""great"" song. So far ""Swingin' London Town"" is probably the one that sticks out the most in my head. So if this is your first outing with Girl's Aloud, check out their earlier two albums (preferably 2004's ""What Will the Neighbors Say"" with my favorite GA track ""The Show""). I'd still recommend this CD for Girls Aloud fans even though it's not my favorite. Yet compared to our American pop music, UK pop music is still on top."
5,Timeless classic,"The Girls Aloud CD ""Chemistry"" is a real timeless classic. A very upbeat CD years and years later and songs ""Biology"" and ""Models"" are like so cool this is like one of the greatest groups around on the market. This innovative well known group offers some of the best music post 2000. They have a great sound and are a pleasure to listen to along with The Spice Girls and All Saints and Sugababes."
5,Love It,"I will review all these songs for you.01. IntroJust the intro, but it is so cool!02. ModelsThe first song where Girls Aloud swear, but it isn't bad. My favourite song!03.

5,I like this book,I would give this book five stars because I love the sea and sea animals.I love them because they are nice.I love magic tree house books because they are interesting.Sea animals are very good to learn about.
3,Its okay,It was a little more beat up than I was expecting. We lost a library book and needed to replace it so I was okay with gently used but it was a bit more than that
4,Good,It was exciting for a magic tree house book. I kind of wish it was more dramatic or something if you know what I mean. Pretty good book. P.s. there should have been whales
5,:),"Magic Tree House series is great for 3-5 graders and for ESL. The sentences are short and easy to understand, yet they incorporate challenging vocab for kids to learn. I highly recommend it."
4,what beatiful ocean it has swimming dolphins.,"This time, Jack and Annie try solve the new riddles from Morgan.The fist riddle, they traveled to an ocean.They had many trouble in their travel.But two dolphins help them.I can imagine beautiful ocean in the story."
5,Magic Tree House,My granddaughter has a learning problem but for some reason she loves all the Magic Tree House Books and I made a point of purchasing them for her. The books kept her interested in reading.Very pleased with speed of receiving book.
2,Does not help people,"This book does not help boys become better, but rather encourages them to laugh at the illustrations. Maybe if it was a newer book or more contemporary or even more modern it would be better to read. But at it is, it is just a target for derision."
2,You don't need this,The thermometers are inaccurate. I have not used them more than once. The only useful thing in this set is the medicine dispenser...just buy a medicine dispenser on its own.
2,Good Luck,"Good luck getting your baby to use this pacifier! If they have a regular one they use, they will know the difference! Trust me. This is not for you if you have a picky baby!"
5,Three classics in one!,"Great spiritual reading for anyone interested in Western mysticism. Noy only do you get meditations to make your mind soar on the mystery of Christ in the ""Tree of Life"", but you also get a ""skeleton"" of the mystical life in the ""Soul's Journey into God"". I only wish I had more background into the mystics, but for anyone with a background in the gospels, be they Protestant or Catholic, this book will be highly informative. I have yet to read the third part of the book, which is a biography of St. Francis. Needless to say I was pleased. Along with the forward by a Franciscan scholar, you get three classical works in one.For someone really intersted in a life of prayer, meditative and contemplative, this is a must-have."
1,Otis Redding's recordings,"the problem with all of Otis Redding's recordings is they are all in MONO, only one was recorded in STEREO. Otis Blue is in stereo if you get the double CD version because one CD is stereo, the other the original MONO.Personally, I hate listening to anything is MONO even Otis, and I love the man's voice."
3,review,I was disappointed with this product. My wind noise has now shifted from the front of the sunroof to the back but it is louder than it was before.
2,Not one of Michael's best books,"I am a big fan of Michael Crichton, but I did not care for this book."
2,How did this book win an award?,"I am a fan of Michael Crichton's. Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace. However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense. I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-)Sigrid"
3,Reading with Tequila,"A Case of Need was Michael Crichton's first novel and it showed. The book was decent, but it lacked the polish of his later work. I was interested, but not engrossed and could have put it down and never missed finishing it. Forgettable."
3,informative medical fiction,"this book was a good way to spend a rainy day. crichton is so good at explaining technical information to the layperson, in this case medical terminology. as i reader, i felt a part of the medical community. this was a good early effort, preceding his wonderful ER tv series by a good 25 years."
3,Too many acronyms,"Good Storyline, controversial topic, ineteresting plot development. One can't help but admire MC for putting himself through medical school by writing mass market paperbacks. The development of his brilliant writing style is evident in this book, and the characters and events are eerily realistic. Unfortunately, I couldn't handle the acronyms (with the accompanying footnotes)! Personally, I would have preferred the complete terminologies, because everytime I stumbled across an acronym (and then had to read the footnote), it broke my concentration. This marred my enjoyment of the book considerably. However, it is still worth buying."
3,Definitly not as good as some of his others.,"Although this book kept me hooked, it just wsn't as suspenseful as some of his others (such as Rising Sun, Jurassic Park and Disclosure). I found the footnotes and appendices confusing and annoying and also wondered about the weight gain and the hair growth as it really wasn't explained."
5,Another Crichton Masterpiece,"Of all the Michael Crichton books i have read in the past, A Case of Need was my favorite. It was an edge of your seat thrill ride keeping you guessing until the end. The intertwining mix of medicine and mystery was great. You will not be able to put this book down. You cant go wrong by reading this book."
3,First book written by Michael Crichton,"I read this book last year. I really wanted something newer by Michael Crichton but since I had already read all his new stuff and his other book release was delayed. I decided to give this one a try. I could tell the difference in writing right away. Michael Crichtons writting has definetly developed a lot more if you read some his newer books. By newer books I mean prey, state of fear and next. This book was still a pleasure to read just like almost all books I've read that we're written by Michael Crichton. Although in my opnion it wasn't as fast moving and a thriller type book when compared to prey, state of fear or next. Still a great read and definetly one too add to your collection if your a Michael Crichton fan since its his first book."
4,Ert...,"Wow. I'm not a very big Crichton fanatic... I've only recently read a few of his books, Sphere included, and I think they're absolutely amazing... I loved the way he included footnotes and indexes.. not only did they help with the tone of the book (i sound like an idiot), I could actually understand the medical terminology >.< ! Does Crichton have a bone to pick with Catholics? Or did those parts go completely over my head? Anyway, the parts that I did comprehend were absolutely fantastic."
4,Great educational read,"This book is on of the best of Crichton I've ever read. With the exception of his most recent novel, Jurassic and Congo I have read everyone of his novels. You just can't go wrong with Crichton."
4,Almost his best,"Out of all of Crichton's books, only Jurassic Park topped this one. The book was gripping and interesting the entire way through. I would recomend this book to people of all ages. I read it the first time as a thirteen year old and enjoy it just the same now, six years later!"
5,Excellent for anyone who loves mystery and medicine.,"I absolutely loved this novel. I could barely put it down. I was already a fan of Mr. Crichton, but after reading this early work of his I was convinced of his talents. The book keeps you on the edge at all times. It also throws around alot of medical terminology that keeps me, a pre-medicine student, interested. Give this fine piece of fiction a chance."
4,Keeps you guessing and reading late into the night....,"I found myself losing track of time while reading this book. Even with all the technical medical terms, it was east to follow and enjoy. It's an exciting thriller, and an original idea written from a unique point of view."
4,A Case of Need - Vintage Crichton,"As a fan of Michael Crichton - and having read all of his novels, I was surprised and delighted last week to find this book. Originally published in 1969, the medical aspects of the book are surprisingly un-dated. Subtle humor, suspense and the vintage Crichton style of writing made this a book that I couldn't put down. The controversial subject is as current today as it was nearly 30 years ago - and although the dialogue of the characters is somewhat dated, I was nevertheless unable to put this book down. Part expose, part mystery, part detective story, part edification - and all Crichton at his finest"
3,"Decent, but don't expect much","This was an okay book to read. It was entertaining, however, very forgettable. Having finished the book last night, I had already forgotten the main characters name. Crichton deals with abortion in an evenhanded manner. What the story lacks however seems to be any real substance. The story seems very trite and easy to predict each turn that it will take. It does keep you interested while you read it, but only to confirm what you figured out early on. All in all three stars for the lack of depth found in this novel (unlike most Crichton novels.)"
4,A Case Of Need,"A good book, easy to read. It really kept me wondering what was going to happen next, at points I had a hard time putting it down. I most always read ""true crime"" books but this one was really quite thrilling! I'm prone to like anything to do with ""medical"" or ""hospitals"" and that kind of thing though."
3,"Good, But Not His Best","A Case of Need was an alright book with a so-so book, but I felt that it could have been better, All of Crichton's other novels such as Rising Sun and Jurassic Park have been great so why not this one? Maybe because he wrote it when he was much younger. I think this was published in the 1960's? Whoa! That's a long time ago."
2,Ho-hum.,"Boy, did this book ever dissapoint me. Sure, Chrichton is very accurate in his details of the medical world, but at the expense of developing his characters. If you are a fan of Dickens, Greene, John Irving, who make their characters real living beings, do not pick up this Chrichton book. The ""who did it"" in this myster book is so insignificant to the story that I frankly found it the easy way out for the author. ""I've got to invent something just to end this dang book,"" you can hear Chrichton saying to himself.Yawn."
2,Didn't like it much,"In my opinion, this book is Michael Crichton's most boring novel I've ever read. I had trouble understanding this book. But judging from my memories, I think this would've been a better book if I understood it better, but who knows? I just didn't like it that much the time I read it plus the trouble-understanding, so it's 2 stars for me. Some memories also kick back to me that I almost fell asleep reading it or yawned. (But these are just my views.)"
2,ehhhhh,"I really didn't like this book. I'm a real Crichton fan, but I didn't like this one. It had too much medical terms to let me understand it. I also didn't really find it too suspenseful."
1,I didn't like it at all.,"I only read it because I had heard how good it was.It was MC's attempt to bring up, a then, controversial subject.I read fiction for fun, not for latest controversy.Was not an enjoyable book for me."
2,Nope,"If you like Crichton's earlier and non science-fiction work you'll like this. However, if you like Crichton because of his fast-paced action novels...you might be dissapointed by this one, at least I was."
2,not that good,"This book drags a bit. I couldn't get into it.I did,however, like the insight into the medical world."
2,Could Have Been Better,I've read better books from many other authors and I think itcould have been written more suspenseful and more detailed
3,pretty good read,"i was kind of suprised when i found out that this book was written in the 60's. It seems that this was a taboo topic (i was not alive yet) that nobody should have really written about. the book is very slow moving and somewhat of a bother to have to go to the appendices to find out the various facts of what crichton is talking about. the novel could have been written better, and thank god that crichton has improved his writing skills. the ending is kind of blah and something that crichton whipped together right before turning in the manuscript to the publisher. it was intrueing to find out the actual lives of the patient and and her family and of how that affected her sitation. although it could have been better, it could have been a lot worse."
2,I was very disappointed in this book.,I found it to start out great but then the story dragged on too long. I loved Disclosure and Rising Sun and felt like I wasted my time with this book.
4,A Case of Need,"I've been a big fan of Michael Crichton ever since I read The Andromeda Strain. Not only is his writing style suspenseful and interesting, but his attention to detail regarding the subject matter can be a learning experience. A Case of Need will certainly give you pause regarding the medical field and the lengths that some doctors would probably go to in order to cover their backsides. Once you are into a Crichton novel it's almost impossible to put down until you are finished."
4,This is a great book!,"I really enjoyed this book. It is very inspiring and I found out a lot about goldie that I didn't know before. She is so happy and it's refreshing to hear about her talking about her struggles in life and at one point in her life when she delt with depression and how she got through it and now is a really happy joyful person who seems to have found peace in her life. The only drawback in the book is that the first chapter is when she's older and then it goes back to her being a child and growing up which, I didn't understand why that was first. Also, in some parts of the book I felt there were certan times when she gave too much information. I also wish she had spoken more about being buddhist and how she came to discover it and study it. Otherwise It's a great book and I give it 4 1/2 stars. I also just started reading you can do it! by lauren catuzzi grandcolas."
3,So far....,"I have just started reading this book - I have always loved Goldie Hawn. She has a light, flitty personality which can be very entertaining to watch. I don't know much about her personal life as I rarely delve that deeply unless a person makes a marked impression on me in my daily dealings in life. Very rare.The only thing I wish to comment on thus far is the misnomer of the title of the book. When I think of a Lotus growing from the Mud, I can't help but think of a successful person who has been born into a horrible home, abused, with painful beginings. Ms. Hawn clearly states in most of the chapters I have read thusfar that her mother was very caring, coddling and supportive during her young childhood. This is hardly growing out of mud. So, I can't see the relationship between her life and the title of her book."
2,I was hoping for more.,"I've seen pics of Goldie with the Dali Lama and was looking to get a spiritual picture of who she is. I found this book to be very elementary...just entries into a diary, she did try to sound deep but it came off as stale,I wish I hadn't been disappointed! I consider myself lucky that a friend had the book so I didn't loose $$$$....sorry Goldie!"
3,Goldie at 60,"For someone who looks like, as Elvis said, a chicken just hatched, she does come off as particularly not introspective, as so far I could tell, she doesn't mention her first husband, and barely mentions her second, except to say he looked terrified in the delivery room. For someone who dotes on her kids, there's not much about them either. He does spend a lot of time on her father, as it appears to be a version of her father which appeared with her in the movie Protocol. He is not eccentric, but appears to be and her mother is certainly not a performer but appears to have wanted what her daughter got in life. She is candid about Swing Shift, which was a mess, and Private Benjamin, which wasn't and she details the Eileen Brennan car crash in a way I've never seen described in the press. Still not very much about her or her current projects."
1,"Love Goldie, but the book? Not so much.","I love Goldie Hawn and will see any movie she's in, many times. (How could she not have been nominated for an Oscar for First Wives Club??) That said, this book was disappointing. She's interesting to listen to on talk shows, so I was surprised I couldn't read this book without my mind wandering. Maybe I'm just not that interested in Goldie's musings on...breathing...life...karma...whatever. Too ephemeral for me, not enough real-life feelings and details."
2,so..so,I found the book interesting but not worth the money I spent. I would recommend checking out the book from your local library.
4,Enjoy Listening to Her,"As others have said, this is a kind of light book, Goldie's grown-up pithy comments on life, love, marriage, and the world. The best part is that this is an audiobook, and I enjoyed listening to her voice as she reads her autobiography. Yes, it's new-agey, of course. She's a sixties child, as am I. Love, peace, ecology, man. Be groovy. OK, I digress. Enjoy her book, and then move on."
5,"GOLDIE, WORTH TEN TIMES HER WEIGHT IN GOLD.","THIS PAGE TURNING BIO WILL BRING TEARS TO YOURS EYES, GOOSE BUMPS TO YOUR FLESH, SO MANY SMILES, MORE TEARS, THEN THE PEACE THAT SHE CREATES WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU. I LOVED THIS BOOK, I AM RE-READING IT. I HAVE BOUGHT 12 COPIES FOR FRIENDS UPCOMING BIRTHDAYS, CHRISTMAS, AND SOME JUST BECAUSE. TRULY A REMARKABLE WOMAN THAT WILL REACH OUT AND TOUCH YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT WHAT THIS WOMAN IS MADE OF. DITZY BLONDE ROUTINE MAY HAVE PAID HER RENT, BUT SHE IS BRILLIANT AND SO BEAUTIFUL, INSIDE AND OUT.I AM A BETTER PERSON FOR READING THIS WONDERFUL BOOK."
5,Goldie Hawn,I have loved Goldie Hawn since she first appeared on TV. She is so cute and irrepresible. And her laughter simply bubbles.
5,Goldie: A Book's Thrown in the Mud,"Now, I like Goldie. I do think Kate Hudson is supremely overrated, while her dad Bill Hudson of 70s snoozefest saturday morning show ""The Hudson Bros. Razzledazzle Show"" is completely underrated. Anway, I'm glad Goldie did this book. Why? For many reasons really. Firsty, she was THE commanding dramatic performance in the movie ""Wildcats"" though she doesn't write about that here. Someone suggested to me a while back that ""Wildcats"" was intended to a be comedy, but that can't be true. I wept for the entirety of the film.Also, she never mentions her marriage to Sonny Bono. Great stuff."
2,Couldn't get interested,"I don't remember Goldie Hawn from Laugh In. I have seen her in only two movies, The Banger Sisters and Butterflies Are Free, and not in the theater but on tv. The book is pretty on the outside and the colored pages are nice. I couldn't get interested in it so I didn't buy it."
5,Better than Danielle Steele,I absolutely loved this book and have told so many others to read it. Goldie is so down to earth and let's no stone go unturned. She knows how to live her life and inspires others to learn from her and know that what is really important isn't the material things but the memories and experiences you pick up along the way. Thank you Goldie! I've passed the book onto a recently widowed neighbor who can smile alittle bit more while turning the pages.
3,Well Intended Philosophy from Giggly Goldie,"There are a few laughs and sweet remembrances in this very long book of anecdotes that seem largely ghost-written, but unless you are extremely open to New Age-ist ideas and life philosophies, you will probably find this read to be slow going.Ms. Hawn continues to be a charming and appealing personality, in front of and behind the cameras...and undoubtedly she is a great humanitarian. However, often the writing comes off as over inflated and grande--exactly the opposite of her image as the fun loving girl you'd like to hang out with in your spare time. That pretension unfortunately makes her many good deeds and loving heart seem like they are theidle amusments of someone rich, privileged and bored. That's not Goldie!I believe the book could have benefitted from more Editorial guidance and, hopefully, this beloved brainy, bubbly blonde will write more books in the future...with a more down to earth and inclusive narrative."
1,Pompous Flower,"Goldie is an American Icon - she is so charming and funny but this does not come across in the audiobook. She read the audiobook and it seemed pompous and self serving. When something serious happens this silly music comes on and you wonder is this for real - really. You get the sense she is trying to let everyone know how great she thinks she is. The greatest daughter, sister, wife, mother ....... Hey and what about ""Foul Play"" she does not mention it and she was so great in that movie! I think she is terrific but it does not come across in the audiobook."
5,Lotus well worth reading,"This book is an excellent read and well worth it. Goldie is very down-to- earth dispite her celebrity status. She is intelligent and I loved her ispiritualism. She tries to be a good person dispite being famous, she isn't one to use her status. She deals with celebrity the right way. Money and celebrity don't make a person. Whats inside is the important part of how we life and deal with people and things. She does with no problem."
5,Clint on good form,"A western typical of early seventies TV fodder but beefed up by the always welcome presence of Clint Walker.The man can do no wrong and after getting the !st series of Cheyenne and enjoying it I looked for more. This movie was it. Good all round action, not the best western around but with lots of good character actors and old Tucson as a backdrop well worth a look.Five stars because of Walker.Now how about Yellowstone Kelly and Gold of the Seven Saints?"
3,Yuma,"If you're a fan of westerns from the 1950's and '60's, you'll like the story. The problem is the print. If you plan on watching it on a relatively large screen, say 40 inches plus, you're in for an unpleasant experience. The transfer, probably from an old VHS tape, is poor and the result is a very ""bleary"" viewing experience. Save your money."
3,"Good western, but poor quality picture","Enjoyed the western, good to see big Clint back in a similar role he played in the Cheyenne series. Be warned however the picture is very soft, lacking sharpness, best watched on a small screen tv. For Clint Walker fans purchase 'Yellowstone Kelly' now released on dvd which an excellent western with a good quality picture."
3,Yuma,"This is a good made for TV movie.Not a high production movie but good.Clint Walker is very good in this role, similar to his roles in the Cheyenne Series.Worth watching."
3,"Great film, Kathy Hays and Clint Walker are adorable!","Not one of my all time favorite films, by any stretch. But it's a good movie and Clint Walker plays a role unlike Cheyenne in this film. You could however, see some of his frustration personally in his work in this film and I'm not sure that was a great idea. Kathryn Hays, the second wife of Glenn Ford is also in it, and she's quite good and surprisingly pretty. I am a western fiend, so any western is good almost. YUMA made in 1970 when the studios were not investing a lot in them anymore. But worth the cost on Amazon."
2,Yuma,"Storyline is not unusual. Also the reproduction was not done well and images were largely blurred. Would be better as a single TV episode, not a full lenght movie."
4,Yuma western,"If you like Clint Walker, as I do, you'll enjoy this western. A classic western that is entertaining to watch."
4,yuma,"Good story, one to keep your attention & watch again & again. A perfect fit for Clint Walker; plays the part of a tough but good-hearted guy. The ending is a little disappointing; feels kind of abrupt & unfinished. I got the feeling Aaron Spelling intended thisto be the prelude to a new series (oh, if only that could have happened!). Definitely worth the buy."
4,Family Western From The Old School,Very nice Clint Walker western that the entire Family can enjoy----Too bad they do not make more of these types today
3,Good,"Dog liked them and they fit the specifications of the diet. Kind of pricey but since it is a specialty item, to be expected."
1,Jams a lot and it breaks too,"I bought a 12 sheet shredder because I hoped that it would not jam when I shred credit card offers without opening them. Well, this one jammed, but not too often, just often enough to be annoying. Moreover, when it jammed it took forever to get it unstuck.It is also made poorly, with a plastic gear in the middle of metal ones. Guess what, the plastic one got stripped. Never again."
2,ugh,price was cheap but I don't think that the cover being half torn off counts as very good condition.
3,Outdated but useful planner,"This planner has a lot of useful information. I especially liked the chart showing when each flower was in season, as well as the real-life bride stories. However, this planner hasn't been updated since the late 1980's, and it shows. The illustrations of bridal attire are sooo dated, but at least they're good for a laugh. Also, the price guidelines are very out-of-date. It could use more checklists, as well as pockets to hold business cards, contracts, and such."
3,School literature set,"*spoiler alert*This book is about family who lives on a farm and had a dog, named Captain. After their dog died their son Daniel rescues a starving dog from a tunnel who they name Lady. Daniel nurses her back to health and when she gets healthy she snarls at him which hurts his feelings. One day they took a walk together and he let her go off into the woods because he was mad. Afterwards he felt bad and worried about her. He stayed up at night and kept looking out the window for her to come back. Towards the end Lady came back and Daniel was happy.The part of the book I did not like was when Daniel put a choke chain on Lady."
1,Whose Specials are these?,"Whose Specials?Not Terry Hall (the original singer.) You won't find him here. Nore Jerry Dammers (the keyboardist mastermind for the original awesome group). No this is a very loose quasi-legal interpretation of the Specials. Some band-member's lawyer won - so this CD exists. Doesn't mean you need to buy it.Could this Cd have value? Perhaps, but branding is everything. This CD may be many things, it may even have appeal for some, but to call it ""The Specials"" is greedy. 'Cuz it just ain't so."
3,Just okay,Missing a lot of gemstones and definitions aren't that great. It's an okay book for beginners but will quickly grow out of it.
2,Not enough details,It didn't include a lot of known gemstones and just didn't have all the details I'd hoped for. I was disappointed.
4,CRYSTAL THERPY,"EXPAINS MUCH MORE THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD. I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THIS IN MY EVERYDAY LIFE. USING THE THERPY AS PREVENTION INSTEAD OF A FIXER UPPER. ENJOY READING, EA TIME I LEARN SOMETHING NEW."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I did not like how the author consistenly refers to Spirit, Goddess, Heaven, and other religous ideas. The reason I chose this book was to find out why I was drawn to a certain type of crystal. I found their writing to be preachy and the content left much to be desired in the way of actual information about crystals. The book just talks about how the crystals are our friends, but only grazes the surface of the individual properties of each crystal and what they mean in your life. I was disappointed. The pictures are not large and beautiful, they are just small representations, and not all the stones are represented in this book. I would say that this is a poor compilation of facts and it is worth every bit of $12.95. In this case, you get what you pay for."
2,So Disappointed,"I love Doreen Virtue and ordered this book on the strength of the other books I've purchased by her. I was extremely disappointed in the book I got, however. The book is printed in extremely large font - which was presumably done to accommodate readers with eyesight issues - but, for me, the formatting made the book extremely difficult to read because it was so unattractive and off-putting. I was also extremely disappointed that there weren't pictures of all the stones in the book and that all of the pictures were in black and white. There are way better crystal books out there, and way better books by Doreen Virtue. I'll be returning this one to Amazon ASAP."
4,Doreen Does What She Does Best!!!!!,"Crystal Therapy is a fantastic introduction to the metaphysical world of crystals. Does it cover every crystal? Of course not! But it certainly covers MOST of the ones that MOST of those working with crystals will ever be using. The way she connects the angels and crystals is work the price of the book alone. Does each description agree with all the other crystal books? Of course not, but no two books or sources completely agree anyway!Doreen is the BEST at gently bringing the metaphysical to the masses. THANK YOU to her for that!"
5,Crystal Gems of Wisdom,"This is a beautiful book co-written by Doreen Virtue and Judith Lukomski, where you learn the messages, meaning and insight that crystals have within their energy, and how it can help you as it pertains to your life.I had the extraordinary honor of listening to Judith Lukomski speak about crystals at a conference, and her extraordinary wisdom and the answers she gave to the people in the room was enormously helpful, especially for me! Just opening the book to any page can also give you a ""message"" that I found surprisingly on target, and it really did help me.This is a great book written by wonderful lightworkers that will surely uplift your life.Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence"
2,Something is lacking,"I've been a fan of this band ever since Deluxe came out in 1995. I loved it and still do, just like their amazing follow-up Friction, Baby. Sadly memorable songs like The Killer Inside, Hung The Moon, WWOZ and Cry In The Sun make me wonder what happened after the release of How Does Your Garden Grow.In my opinion the band went pop, watering down their unique sound. Additionally the cycle of Greatest Hits, Live albums and re-released tracks (Lifetime first appeared on Closer)suggests these guys are either broke or running out of fresh ideas. If you can get your hands on their hard-to-find album Artifakt (2000, Fudge Records). Now that's a five star album."
5,Better Better Than Ezra,Excellent new offering from a band I wasn't too sure about in the past. I bought a greatest hits compilation and that sparked my interest to try this effort. The result was certainly worthwhile! Every cut is a winner and I have turned from an uncommitted interested party to a devoted fan. It takes something special to impress me and this cd did it!
4,One of the most talented trios in music today,"BTE continues to shine on this release. I think this is more of a continuation of ""Closer"" in terms of style and structure. Kevin Griffin is clearly on of the most talented song-writers in rock. The particular stand-outs for me are ""Special"", ""Burned"", and ""Our Last Night"". I have to see this band live!!!"
5,Better Than Ever,"Better Than Ezra is Better Than Ever. The CD takes you on a musical trip from Burned, to Lifetime, and back to Juicy. This southern rock band is still proving that they will not go away.Kevin Griffin's talents shine on this album with a varied style of vocal ranges and infectious guitar riffs and rhythm. Not bad for a boy from Monroe, Louisiana.This is a must-have CD."
2,Former quasi-fan,"BTE has never been one of my favorite bands, but I did like them in their early days. I think this album is a good example of what happens when a band doesn't change and grow over the years. I'd have to say the production sounds great on this album, but the content is desparately wanting (sorry!). The songs are more of the same sounds/wriffs/melodies/lyrics you've always heard from BTE. However, some tracks are downright annoying (""Juicy"" or ""Southern Thang""). I listened to this band in my highschool and college years (10 years ago). Instead of maturing, it sounds like they are still trying to write songs that appeal to the 16-20 year old age range. I was hopeful when I saw they put out a new album, but I won't be as enthusiastic to give another listen when they put out the next one."
3,Where's the Bears?,"If you are looking for a book about bears, keep looking. The word Grizzlies in the title is for marketing purposes. The book is essentially a chronicle of a couple settling in Knight Inlet, BC in the early 20th century as told to the author Beth Day in the 1950's. The book is ably written and entertaining, but is not about bears. The grizzlies have occasional cameo appearances, but don't even rate a co-starring role. There is nothing to be learned about bears here, just a light days read."
4,More than meets the eye,"Think carefully about what the Bunny has to teach us. Many lessons, I suspect. But we will each find our own."
1,Tiny tiny book,It is my fault for not reading the size but this was a very tiny book which originally sold for $1.00 and I paid $2.00. I will be very leary of purchasing books from other sources. My used book stores are much better.
1,A wonderful book--bad edition,"I was re-reading this book before wrapping it as a gift and was appalled to find a great big spellchecker oversight in this particular edition--the real rabbits had ""seems"" instead of seams. With this small amount of text, I wish the publisher had relied on a human proofreader. Sloppy production which reflects a lack of craftsmanship and concern. On the good side, the dark red hardbound cover is nice."
2,Not For The Elderly (Anyone over 6)Reviewer: Sucker for Freebies,"Sadly, nobody read this to me when I was a child, so perhaps I was just too old to appreciate the book. I thought it was more saccarin than sweet. I certainly wouldn't read it to my children! They were brought up on Dr. Seuss, and would have said ""Mom, Puulleesse!"" if I had attempted it. Sorry."
3,Childrens book?,This was one of my favorite stories as a child. I bought this book to read to my son when he is born. But for a children's book it had like four pictures. It could have used some more.
4,Lovely Little Story...,This is another little book that a business associate asked me to purchase. I'm not sure why THIS would be of interest to a professional business coach. However it was a nice little story.I'll read it to a kid one day.
5,A story for all ages,"I read this book to my children many years ago and sent this copy to a freind with young grandchildren.I suspect most young children won't ""get"" the analogies, but when the story is read to them I always embellished and acted out some scenes. It is, in my opinion, a story more suited to being ""told"", at least initially, and possibly even explained, but I love it.The story certainly is a classic and one I'll keep on hand for future generations"
1,was no where near what we had as children,"This is a SMALL Paperback. If you look at Kohls you will find the large hard cover version. ( Which i subsequently did) Sorry i bought this, too small for a child to see the pictures or the words"
5,Great,One of my favorite children's books. I read this to my students this year and they loved it. It's the perfect Christmas book.
4,"Not a bad edition for free, but with some formatting errors.","The story is beautiful, of course, and well worth the read. I was just a bit disappointed that they had lines from headers (or perhaps they were picture subtitles) inserted in odd places. Obviously a formatting oversight, but again, one mustn't complain too much for a free book..."
4,colorful illustrations and good bedtime reading,this is a good length for a bedtime story -- the illustrations are very good too
4,Familiar Childhood Story,I hadn't read this book since I was a child and it definitely brought back some great childhood memories. A great reminder of the importance of childhood toys.
5,Excellent Read,I did not read this book as a child. Read this now and it is a lovely book. It is a feel-good book and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy. Got the kindle version on my iphone and loved the easy read.
4,Good Book,"This book was bought for a book exchange between families at my work. I got good reviews back, although, I didn't use it in my own home."
3,it is a book,got it to add to my kindle. have no real opinion about itgood to have with me when i want to read
5,I recommend this book for everyone.,"Every child should be very familiar with this book, adults too. Especially valuable is the passage where the story points out that true beauty comes from being loved by a child, and outward appearance is not what is important. The illustrations in this particular edition are the most beautiful of all. I bought 6 copies of this book to share with children and grandchildren. I Highly recommend this beautiful edition of this lovely story for all ages.Delivery was quick, I recommend the seller as well."
1,Damaged,This book was supposed to be new. When I received it was smashed and had several marks on it. The price with shipping was $12.95 -- the back of the book listed $4.95 for the book. Was not a good deal.
3,The original,"This was indeed the original. Realized upon looking through it that the illustrations might be scarier than some newer versions, especially for the young children for whom I was purchasing the book."
1,Very disappointed,"The book was not at all what I expected. It was a completely different edition with different illustrations and a different aesthetic, an important consideration for a child's picture book. Also the binding was incredibly loose to the point that some pages are practically falling out. I would not consider this book in good condition."
2,Not what was described,"The description states it is read by Meryl Streep, yet it actually is just the book with very few pics and no option to have it read for the child. My 4 yr daughter loves playing on the kindle and listening to books read to her when I am not available to read to her, so if I had known this wasn't the case, i would not have purchased it."
2,Very small and cheap looking,"I love this story but was upset to have to give it after a gift. The book was tiny, flimsy and disappointing. Wish I would have went to a bookstore to get it."
2,Not the author's best work,"I give this book two stars for its excellent diction and a few amusing bits of description, but I find it painfully sentimental, like Shel Silverstein's ""The Giving Tree."" I have never understood why this story with its abstract ""The Boy"" protagonist is kept available while the same author's delightful masterpiece, ""Poor Cecco,"" is long out of print and valued by book dealers mainly for its wonderful Arthur Rackham illustrations. In contrast to the sadness of the Velveteen Rabbit, the tale of Poor Cecco the wooden dog, his fellow residents of the nursery toy cupboard, and an amusing cast of human and animal supporting characters - all with distinctive personalities - and their droll adventures at home and on the road, is a treasure replete with mystery, surprises, and an elegantly natural style. I was lucky to be given it as a child and wish others could be so fortunate."
2,"Review the MOVIE, please!","I also am very fond of the book. As a movie, however, this leaves a lot to be desired. This is essentially a book on tape, with some still pictures from the book. With no motion, this doesn't hold the interest of my almost-5-year-old. I would strongly recommend the book over this video version."
4,"""The Velveteen Rabbit""","Book as I expected, although I remember the story being a little longer. But, new condition."
3,Not for a sensitive child.,Rabbits are my son's favorite animals. He also likes his stuffies. He did not like the part of this book where the rabbit is almost destroyed. I think it colored his opinion of the whole book. I would not recommend this book for a sensitive child. It is recommended for ages up to 8 and grades K-3rd.
5,Great Bedtime Story,"This story is a sweet classic that can teach a child about being a caring, compasionate person. I think that every child will be able to connect with the little boy in some way."
3,A favorite childhood book,"I love this version of the Velveteen Rabbit...I listened to it when I was a young child and I wanted to pass it along to my children, as well. I love the CD, my only problem is that the book is tiny. I thought it was going to be a full-size book, but it ended up being about 5x5 (length x height) inches.Luckily, I purchased it for the CD, mostly, because I have my original book that I grew up with."
3,"Story wonderful, Illustrations mediocre","The enduring tale of how ""love makes you real"" is enchanting. This classic deserves beautiful illustrations to accompany it. Unfortunately, this version doesn't supply that. It makes it appear cheap, when, in fact, it is a beautiful story that all children should have the privelege of hearing."
1,not as expected!,"I am highly disappointed. the product was NOT what I thought it would be.... a very small book, not usual sized book. Avoid this seller, misrepresents itself. I am not happy."
3,When you pay peanuts...,Not so sure why this product has so many high ratings. The child I read this story to also did not quite engage.
1,wrong replacement parts,said it would fit my model and year wasnt close had to order a completely different replacement mirror glass was very inconvenient had to wait even longer to get the right size
2,Wrong mirror,"Package was on time and nicely packed, unfortunately it was not the correct mirror. I used their does it fit checker but still it was not the right one when it arrived."
1,Wrong part,"It was definitely a mirror and I'm sure it would have been great but it was way to small for my car. I used the handy ""Does this product fit your car"" widget and it said it was good to go, but nope. Had no issue returning it, but unfortunate that it wasn't the correct size."
5,great board,I got this for my son at a local shop here in town and spent a lot more money for it. It is a great board and my son has had it for about an year now and we had NO trouble at all with it. He spent a total of 6 hours a week on it for a total of 300 hours now and I'm sure we have another 300+.
2,Outdated,Outdated and with duplicate information from catering books you probably already own. Does include a lot of recipes but again this book is right on the cutting edge of 1992. I recommend modern batch cooking as an alternative with lots of recipes.
1,No go,Well maybe this product would work if your cat will tolerate it. My cat however will NOT eat it in her dry or wet food. Even with a smaller dose than she needs. Waste of money for me. :(
2,Local interest doesn't overcome weak story,"I have pleasant memories of Bridgeville Delaware, where my uncle was actually mayor at one time. (However, he was neither corrupt nor silly.) I enjoyed the scenery, particularly Jimmy's but the story was sort of silly and more like a TV show than a real movie."
1,Fail to deliver,"I ordered this product on December 10th, and was promised delivery between December 16th and 19th. On December 23rd, I was informed that my order was cancelled. So much for the Christmas present for my nephew! I note that the seller was ""orange onion."" As my product was never delivered, Amazon does not allow for me to review the provider, so unfortunately the review for the car itself doesn't have one. Even though it was not delivered during the dates promised and cancelled on the 23rd, Amazon still has ""Available"" on its website.I would highly discourage ordering any product that has ""OrangeOnion"" as the provider. Apparently Amazon doesn't have its act together either as it still says the product is available even though they sent me an email notifying that my order was cancelled.Hugely disappointing to both me and my nephew."
2,El cheapo!,Want to buy something cheap that won't last and will bring more frustration to your child and yourself than anything else. This product is what you need!
5,Great book,I went to the library at my college and check it out. Just after looking at it I ordered it on here. Very nice job! Great info and great selection of plants. Not like the handbook this has plenty of plants.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!I,"I cannot review the iron because, as another customer experienced, I was sent the wrong iron (first impressions). I have to wait for return label and stand in line at a UPS store in Christmas crowds to return. I won't get my refund until they receive the iron. They didn't say how I will receive the refund......poor business!!!!!!"
2,Does NOT show the 'whole' problem-just the equation,"We bought this so that my son could see ALL the facets of adding and subtracting numbers, and especially to address a problem my first grader was having with lining up the numbers under the actual equation. Yes, this calucator shows the problem - but NOT the steps they teach in school. There are no 'figuring' steps, so he still has no idea how to carry over numbers, or borrow for substraction, or add a zero for double-digit addition. There's nothing showing him how the answer was found - just that there is an answer. He certainly knew this from the other calculators in the house. In other words, the only thing this calculator does is set up the problems in school format - it doesn't show how to solve it, step by step, which is what is required by the school. We are back to square one, and my son is no closer to solving a two-digit subtraction problem than he was before we bought this. But he's having fun pushing the buttons."
2,weak keys,"Good overall design, except that the keys are of poor quality, so you often have to push twice before a number appears. This really detracts from the use of this product (my son gets frustrated when using it). There are many similar products out there, try them out. It is borderline useable, so I will not return it, but I would not buy it again. Not recommended.To the manufacturer: what were you thinking ?! This is such an obvious flaw..."
1,pictures of screen are FAKED,"The screen is way less resolution than the pictures would have you believe. The multiplication X sign is more like four slashes that do not come together at the middle - does not look like a multiplication sign unless you know what you are looking at. The numbers are skinnier too because of the low resolution. It actually claims ""high resolution"" on the back of the package but in no way is that true. We were very disappointed and sent it back."
3,"Beneficial, but with side effects","I take these because my diet is poor in some nutrients such as zinc, chromium, and some of the B vitamins which I need in relatively high quantities to deal with my various issues which I don't want to get into here. Taking supplements for each of these nutrients individually is not really an option for me.The product does seem to supply me with what I need. The only problem is that it also causes stomach upset, even if I take it with a meal, and especially if I take it on an empty stomach."
1,Very Hard on the Stomach,"This multivitamin causes me to throw up. I've been taking gummi vitamins and Floradix before I tried to make the switch to this more affordable multi + iron.The first morning I thought that throwing up was a fluke. But this morning, sure enough--5 minutes after taking the vitamin and while I was making my oatmeal, I had to run to the bathroom and throw up. I'm definitely not pregnant. I haven't felt nauseous at any other point during these two days. The vitamin is the only change. What a drag."
5,"Completely understandable, thorough and up-to-date","The 6th addition of ""Photography"" provides the easiest and completest compilation of terms, techniques, and history of photography. Unlike earlier versions, it has up-to-date references on digital imaging and computer manipualation. The content is so understandable, it can be read by pre-teenagers and adults without losing interest. In addition, the content is graphically presented in such a manner that schools can accept the illustrations without fear of censorship without sacrificing artistic license. The thorough presentation of most all common (and some exotic) photographic processes and camera techniques will appeal to all levels of people interested in photography. As a teacher of photography for 25 years, I would be proud to have this as the primary text for all courses."
4,A bit dated...,This has many insights useful for photographers at all levels. But it's a bit dated; a significant portion of the book covers film and how film is processed. I know several professional photographers and NOT ONE uses film.
5,The best photo book ever written,"I bought this book and carry it with me in my briefcase. I am so impress with all the clear complete information in the book that I have purchased a second book to keep in the safty of my home in case something happens to my first one. I shoot large format and the chapter on 4x5 camera has all the information that I need to produce great photos. And in addition it also has all the information for developing slides and negatives and printing negatives. And of course all the rest in the book is the best written. This is the only book I need for all photography including having a studio. I wish that I had discovered this book years ago as I would have save Hundreds of dollars that I spent on all my many, many other books. Buy IT!, You will be glad you did."
3,Overpriced,"As a college teacher I have used this book for two decades and watched it's price go up and up. Obviously, I think it is a good book.However, the camel's back has finally broken at the current 74 (!) dollar paperback price.I cannot justify asking intro students to pay this much.I will find a suitable, less expensive alternative. The price difference will be best spent on film."
5,A Basic link to all aspects of photography,"If you really really can only buy one book, get this. Somehow it cost only US$30 here in Singapore. There's no better book on general photography than this for any amount of money.The book generalised photography and yet does not skimp on any topics, there's just enough for one to know about any form of photography and that's the good thing about it. It links all aspects of photography together and makes one appreciates other forms of photography not previously explored.It helps to get specialised books to further enhance specific topics, like John Shaw's Profrssional Field Techniques, Landscape Photography; Jim Zuckerman Natural Light Photography; Another excellent book on general photo techniques is Lee Frost's A-Z of Creative Photography. There are many other great photography books that I keep, for reference and leisure reading."
5,This book is my choice of the best text book available.,"This is my choice of the best text book available for all levels of photography. This sixth edition is well illustrated with examples from a variety of photographic disciplines.It provides excellent coverage of topics such as the zone system, history of photography, digital imaging, color, view camera, and seeing photographs."
4,Needed this book for school.,"The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because the book is not clear on certain words. For example, Word A means B, and word B means A. To me it was not very clear. I am happy for the price that I got it for because it is a lot better paying here than at my school. Saved me 30 bucks ^^."
3,Instructor's review copy,"Apparently it seems to be an instructors review copy. With a bunch of writing indicating it is that copy on the cover. I'm not satisfied that they are falsely advertising a product that is the student version, even though it is not.It doesn't look good in the classroom. Come on, why sell under a different name? You decide.....?Other than that embarrassing mistake, seems like a healthy book.I will have to verify if the content had not changed ;)"
1,Junk,This is not squirrel proof !!! The sit on the roof and lean down and clean it out . 20 lbs a week of seed PIGS !!!!!!!!!!!!Don't Purchase this Item
5,Iconic New Zealand childrens book,"Brilliant book, well written and thoroughly entertaining..I bought it 20 years ago for my children and now I'm buying it for friend's Grandchildren...A MUST buy, especially since it is a "" Kiwi "" story and so much fun...kids will love it and know it by heart..."
5,Great TV series,"That 70's Show really brings me back to the good old days. This package is neatly packed into a sturdy ""stash"" box. Fans of the show won't be disappointed."
5,Excellent purchase,"I went through college watching this show. This is an excellent purchase for those looking forward getting all seasons in one ""stash"" box. The packaging, the extras, it's all worth it! A must-have for ""That 70's Show"" fans."
5,tv,We watch an episode of this every night before bed and it is the perfect way to unwind from a stressful day.
4,Can't stop laughing.,"It's very rare when an american comedy series makes me actually laugh. Being mexican, and used to a different kind of humor, I find it difficult to enjoy comedies... with a couple of notable exceptions, and ""That 70's Show"" being one of them.It's witty, charming, fast paced, no dull moments. Dialogues are very clever, and the acting is superb. They say it's much more difficult to make someone laugh than cry. These people are great at what they do. I laughed. A lot."
3,70s Show Giftset,"All came timely and the packaging and extra materials were great. However, one of the DVDs had nothing on it - it was a gift so not that great after all. Now working on how to return the one DVD. I would think twice about purchasing a gift set again. But I was also delighted to get an e-mail invite to do a review; this is rare -I buy a lot on line.K.in DelawareThat '70s Show: Complete Giftset"
5,This Set RULES!!!,My young adult son requested that I purchase this set for him. He did the research and was most pleased with the AMAZON pricing.The DVD's are perfect; the packaging is attractive; delivery was as promised and well-packaged.We're all happy!
5,That 70's Show rocks!!!,"The series was great, the packaging reminded me of my childhood and the price is the cheapest anywhere! Thanks so much!"
2,I love this show BUT,"I really do love this show, my complaint here is with the box itself. I bought this box BRAND NEW and the packaging that each disk came in caused them to scratch. All of them. So each disk freezes in the middle of the third episode and refuses to play any episode past that. I absolutely recommend that you get the show, I do suggest, however, that it's more prudent to buy each season individually in a box that isnt made out of grainy paper and packed with plastic."
5,That 70s Show,"This box set is awesome...I love the way the set up is. It comes in a box that clips closed and has a handle so you can carry it around. It also comes with the script to the last episode in the 8th season. That was a really good idea. The show is very funny and entertaining. I went through 8 seasons in like 2 weeks, its all that was playing in my house ! In my top shows for sure !"
1,Do Not Buy Disc Errors,Do not buy the set. Buy each season individually. The set has disc errors. Even if you buy the product brand new you will have problems. I am NOT satisfied with my order.
5,One of the best purchases,This has been one of the best purchases ever. Hours and hours of entertainment. This is just a great show.
4,Packaging thoughts...,"I won't review the show, I'm a fan, but this is about the packaging. I love the look but the reality is just too flimsy and not very functional. The stash box is a great look, but after two openings the latches fell out. The little 45 sleeves are cute, but end up scratching the discs. The size is just a little tight for what it contains and adds to the risk of scratching the discs. I don't regret my purchase, just wish the packaging held up a little better."
2,Consider price over quality,"That 70's show is great don't get me wrong. They include all 8 seasons, a book of all the episodes, and a script of the last episode in season 8. But the discs are not great quality. When I played a disc for the first time it was scratched. If you want my opinion get the other box set that is more expensive; I would not recommend it. Oh by the way it was a new box set."
5,That 70's Show,This is one of my favorite TV series. It is in the 70's a great time for America. It is funny and with meaning that we older Americans remember. Great viewing.
5,That 70's Show,"I gave my Granddaughters the boxed set for Christmas, and they watch episodes any time they get a chance! They LOVE it, and I'm so glad I got it for them."
4,Hours of laughter. Incredible presentation,"This is a great collector's item. For me, this was a chance to see again a young Aston Kutcher, Topher Grace and Mila Kunis, just having a great time. The box includes all of the episodes (of course), and the presentation is flawless. Each season is presented into a box resembling a worn-out 70's record album box.The only thing I was a little disappointed was the amount of extra content. I was expecting a few more interviews with the cast, but all you get is director commentaries. Nonetheless, I think it's a great value for its price."
2,dont buy it,"As you can see, this product is almost $240. if you were to buy each season seperatley, it would cost just under $200.my friend purchased this set and we decided to watch the whole first and second season. We had alot of problems with the disc skipping.put your money into each individual season, you will save money and have less dificulties."
5,A truely entertaining series!,"This was a great series to watch for the 8 years the series was on, every episode was very funny. I grew up in the 1970's and so I remember the styles, movies, and attitude the characters in the series had so it was nostalgic and amusing at the same time. The actors in this series is fantastic Topher Grace (Eric), Laura Prepon (Donna), Danny Masterson (Hyde), Wilmer Valderama (Fes), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Ashton Kutcher (Kelso), Debra Jo Rupp (Kitty), and last but NOT least Kurtwood Smith (Red) are all so funny and were such good actors of this show. The series starts in 1976 and ends on New Years Eve 1979. Between these years you have the ""kids"" growing up, experimenting in things, dating, sex, Rock and Roll and so much more are highlighted in every episode. This is one of my favorite series of all time and I very Highly Recommended to those who enjoy funny, intelligent, and nostalgic episodes!! HAVE A NICE DAY!!"
2,how to do what i know to do w/ i-life 04,"i bought this book along w/ 2 other ""how (not) to video editing books specializing in FCXpress-i'm sorry i did-if the dog hadn't p'd on them i'd send them back-why?- I used to be a pogue fan till the repetion started-jim heid's guide is why i got into the mac & imovie in the 1st place-simple to learn & to the point with immediate results( highly reccomended). I found Guy's book lacking in some of the most important sound upgrades-strange since his claim to fame was in audio (i-pod) i also don;t like to be told to go look for imfo somewhere else-at least J. heid gives you a link to goto-as for the FCXpress-after reading 101 tricks- i can already do them w/ 3rd party plugins & still have the ease of imovie. No put downs intended-just dissapointed-when will a video guy 1st / computer challenged-how to book be written ?"
2,These are 2.4x not 8x,"The burning speed is incorrectly advertised as 8.0x when it's actually a maximum of 2.4x. Takes 45 min to burn just one instead of 15 min like I hoped I would be getting.Updated***These discs are terrible. Seems like they're warped pretty bad about 2/4ths the way through the second layer. Burned 4 of them and all give same results. I burned 8 video files to the disc and about 10 min into the 6th 30 min episode, it suddenly goes back to the main menu. I bought a new awesome pioneer dvd player and Verbatims work very nice with it but pass up on these phillips dvds"
4,Adhesive Remover,"These wipes defintely helped in the removal of medicated patches that my son uses. However, I still could not get all of the adhesive off his skin."
5,Stay to the rear James Bond,"I read reviews and marvel at people running down the exciting and happy writing offered with the Dirk Pitt Novels. Some complain it is the same old thing. Others state many of the things are unbelievable, and etc. and etc on and on. Why do they read it knowing it is fiction. Clive Cussler has well proven his ability to produce readable interesting stories. It is quick, interesting, and many times instructional. Behind all fiction is some fact and his real life in the seas surely substanciates that. Instead of total criticism to a wordsmith take a long look and see if you have the ability to better his writing. If so I strongly suggest you get on the word processor immediately and bang out something better. As I feel I will look forward to each book written and will enjoy his topics in the sense of happy action stories. Long live Dirk Pitt and all concerned."
2,Did Cussler Write This,"Did Cussler really write this book? Weakest plot of any of his work. Unlike his others, this book starts very slow...and then fails to pick up speed. And mistakes? There were many...especially with directions like east and west (hurricanes travel from east to west and not west to east as Cussler said)or distances like hundreds of miles and thousands of miles (the Pananma Canal was 100's of miles away and Cape Horn was 1,000's not the other way around as the book indicates). If Cussler actually wrote this book, who edited it? I have thoroughly enjoyed all the fiction Cussler has written with his name on the author's line. Until I read this one. It's a shame that Dirk and Al had to end their careers (or so the story implies) on such a low note. And how exciting are the books with Dirk Jr. and Summer as the main characters going to be? Being brother and sister, Cussler can't even turn the series into romance novels."
2,Not Clive's Best Work,"I've been a Cussler fan since the mid-'80s and have read everything and anything his name his on. But I've got to say that this is by far my least favorite. The writing is pedestrian, the story predictable, and the characters just do not live up to their terrific heritage. The introduction of Dirk's kids is awkward, and at first more than a little confusing, since his son is also ""Dirk Pitt."" I think what surprised me most was the repetition and appalling lack of editing the book recieved. Clive repeats facts, scenarios, and background information over and over again in different chapters, as if it was the first time being presented. It's almost like there were long gaps during his writing period where he had forgotten what he had already written. I guess that's understandable, but what's not understandable is how all this got past his editors! I would highly recommend most of Clive's books, but not this one."
2,"Base plot OK, writing suffers.","The plot may be doubtfully realistic, but it's not what bothers me about this book - Actually the plot idea is fairly exciting. The way the people talk to each other, really bothers me. It's either scriptspeak, or overtly complicated. It's just not realistic. Even in heated action the characters will use complicated play-on-words, analogies and sayings which seems completely ridiculous to me. The way brother and sister talk to each other also seems way overscripted and complicated. People just don't talk like that.Moreover there's a lack of degrees of contrast - From the happy happy rosy family dinners to the evil emotionless enemy (who will still be shocked, though, at seeing an american flag, while the good guys will stare in reverence.....sigh).But the base plot is good, and I kept on going because of that."
4,Consistently entertaining,"I have been reading Clive Cussler novels for 25 years. He has not written a bad novel yet. His stories are pure escapist, action adventure yarns. Do not judge his books by the two that have been made into movies. Sahara doesn't follow the novel at all. I think some of the other reviewers on this site are too [...] a novel that is soley intended to be mind candy. This is like a comic book with no pictures. A relaxing read perfect for the beach or a long flight. Keep'em coming Clive!"
1,Illiterate Trash,"Four sentences, pulled at random from different chapters, should tell you all you need to know:""Now as their objective stood before them it became obvious that unlike the others towns and cities they had sacked, this one would not fall without a long and lengthy campaign.""""'You ain't gonna believe this,' he answered in a Georgia accent, 'but the last dropwindsonde profiling system I released recorded horizontal wind speeds of up to two hundred and twenty miles an hour as it fell through the storm toward the sea.'""""Exotically designed minibuses with luxurious interiors and painted lavender pulled up to the aircraft to accommodate the passengers.""""Seemingly adhered to the marble slab, he could not move nor turn his head.""Talk about phoning in your work! Best-selling author(tm) Clive Cussler has discovered he can insult readers and desecrate the English language with impunity, so long as he keeps making money for his publisher."
4,Another very good Cussler/Pitt tale,"It's as simple as this, if you are a fan of Clive Cussler and his Dirk Pitt tales, then you will enjoy this book, in the same way that a James Bond fan enjoys all of those books."
2,Who are you and what did you do with Mr. Cussler,"Being a huge Clive Cussler fan I usually grab a copy of any new novel he releases. Trojan Odyssey was no exception, however the quality of the writing makes me suspect that Mr. Cussler is on hiatus. This book could not have been written by my favorite author, it's not even average. After seeing Robert Ludlum release a new book (apparently from his grave) I'm beginning to believe that there ought to be a disclosure if the work is not that of the author listed on the cover."
1,Brown Crud,"It's difficult to know how to describe this book. Exciting, gripping, realistic, well-written, intriguing, thought-provoking? This book is none of these things. The plot would be considered overly silly for an Austin Powers movie, and I seriously expected that at any moment, the arch-baddie (Spector) was going to appear on a video screen in the White House to demand 'One Million dollars'.The dialog would be considered poor for a 1950's Boys Own comic book and the characterization is so thin that my partially blind pet cat could see through it. The only reason I continued through to the end was the fact that I was on a dare from my wife to finish it. I could not recommend this book to anyone, even if they were in solitary confinement in a Turkish prison and the alternative was insanity."
2,Ooops Clive!,"After reading some of the less flattering reviews I decided to read Trojan Odyssey for myself, not believing one of my favorite guilty pleasures could have missed so badly. Sad to say, though many of the ""Cussler"" gimmicks are still included, they seem weak, over done and flat in the overall plot this time. Dirk's kids are just not interesting and after spending so much time with them before the plot takes any real ""action"" I wanted to send them to their room for quiet time. Dirk (Sr.) is getting long in the tooth and would be better served if replaced permenantly with Kurt Austin ( a doppleganger to be sure, but hey, no insufferable offspring yet.). Maybe Clive is stretching himself too thin these days, maybe his flare for exciting thrillers is running dry. Whatever it is, I hope this is only a blip, and if he needs three or four years between books to get back in top form, I'm willing to wait before crossing him off my must read list - after all, so many books, so little time!"
2,Not much to recommed here.,"It's been awhile since I've read a Clive Cussler book, and now I remember why I quit reading them. I found this a bore of a book. The best part of the book is the first part where Cussler describes a Category 5 hurricane and the effects that such a thing can have. I did not like the characters in this book. For example, Dirk's new-found children are stiff and wooden, and don't seem real at all. Even the bad guys (or women in this book), seem character parodies rather than to be real villains. The premise behind the book is a good one - an alternate explanation to Homer's epic poem ""The Odyssey"". That part did make me think a bit, and I wasn't aware that there was a school of thought out there about Odysseus' adventures occurring in the Atlantic Ocean rather than the Mediterranean Sea. But other than that, I wouldn't recommend this book. If you must read it, borrow it from the library or from a friend."
3,Cussler east/west snafu,"Normally Clive is pretty accurate, but in this one, he had the hurricane traveling on an eastbound track towards(?) the US mainland. It referenced this ""eastbound"" several times, when most of us in the southland know that almost all hurricanes originate off the African coast, heading westward toward the US.Cest la vie"
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"I was looking for an adventure book and was fully expecting elements that were somewhat beyond reality, but this was ridiculous. A floating hotel with guests totally oblivious to the dangers of hurricanes in the Caribbean? A billionaire who ranks among the world's wealthiest but who remains completely anonymous even to the CIA?The writing is extremely laborious (was Cussler paid by the word?) and the dialogue does not even closely resemble everyday conversation.I tried to convince myself that I could get through a few flaws and still enjoy the story for what it was - but I could not. Ultimately, I just stopped reading. If you value your time in any way, don't bother picking this one up. Horrible!"
3,"Sadly, Cussler is slipping, but I enjoyed it nonetheless","First of all, the editing for this book was terrible. Trojan Odyssey is full of errors that a seventh-grader editing the back pages of the junior high yearbook would catch. It takes away from the story.As others have mentioned, there is a basic Cussler formula, and TO sticks to it. Formulaic and predictable, especially for longtime Cussler fans, there were happily a few minor surprises. As always, the attention to detail in regards to ships and diving was superb. The same cannot be said for the writing in regards to much of the action, and it would be nice to see other characters evolve besides Pitt (to be fair, it seems that may be the case with the next offering).A good time-killing, waiting at the airport sort of book, but not Cussler's best effort (I've always liked Night Probe and Iceberg the most)."
3,Just OK,"I am a big fan of Cussler's books and generally enjoy them tremendously. The enjoyment is not based on their intellectual challenge. Far from it. Cussler's books are not challenging, but just pure fun. Bubble gum for the brain. The plots are spectacular, at times unbelievable, and the characters are super human. But it does not matter. Almost.Trojan Odyssey is a little bit too unchallanging and too predictable. It seems at times that Trojan Odyssey is just an amalgamation of Cussler's prior books. It is still a fine diversion from the real world, just not as much as the others."
3,One hair raising narrow escape after another,One hair raising narrow escape after another.The first was a monster hurricane threatening a huge floating hotel. Followed by the rescuing of Dirk's twin children who were trapped where they had been working in an under water habitat that was rolled over into a trench by the hurricane. An evil organization run by women trying to divert the Gulf Stream through tunnels under Nicaragua to create massive climate change in Europe and the eastern United States had to be stopped.Typical Cussler novel - Super hero who can overcome any crisis or evil plot.
3,My First Clive Cussler...,"Other reviews for this book tear it apart for its goofiness - and they're right. The last quarter of the book is based on a truly goofy premise, and the final paragraph was the goofiest! But throughout the book are exciting action scenes and it was able to keep my attention. All in all, not a wasted time spent reading, but if my next Cussler is like my first, it will be my last..."
2,"Fairly engrossing, but badly written","While well-plotted, Trojan Odyssey is so unevenly written that I found myself distracted every few pages by another clumily constructed sentence. I could tolerate the bland two-dimensional characters, but when I read a best-selling author who's seemingly so indifferent to the quality of his work as to fail to proofread it, I begrudge him his literary success.I won't be reading Clive Cussler again."
1,AWFUL!,"Wow, where can I start? This book was truly dreadful in pretty much every imaginable manner. Not only was the plot completely absurd and filled with glaring inconsistencies, as already mentioned, but was totally transperant. In this type of book a little artistic license can be granted for the sake of a gripping storyline, but this book offers nothing in the way of suspense. The characters are ridiculous cardboard cutouts which do nothing to fix the book's predictability. I've never read any other of Cussler's novels (and now never will), so I'm not sure if his writing is always like this, but here he seems to have little command of the English language, his prose is drowning in mangled phrases, overblown cliches and pointless technical jargon.A travesty from start to finish - don't waste your time on this book!"
1,Disappointing. Poor editing. Older work is much better.,"I read some good early reviews on Amazon and bought the book on a whim. It's lousy, like his last several have been. Besides the rehashed plot, two-dimensional characters, and poor dialog, the book suffers from horrible editing. I'm sure Cussler can afford a proof reader and editor, but you couldn't prove it by this book. There are time/space conflicts, contradictions, subject/verb agreement problems, etc. I love Cussler's early stuff (Raise the Titanic, Sahara, etc.) but save your money and skip this one. If you want to read adventure pick up Lonesone Dove or early Cussler."
1,Awful,"Someone gave me this book, plus Valhalla Rising. I'm not sure why I continued reading after the first few pages. Maybe morbid fascination. Cussler is one of the worst writers (""Curse you, Red Baron."") I have ever had the misfortune of reading. In a word, he's awful. Dennis Halsey."
1,Better than Valhalla Rising (but that's not saying much),"OK, a bunch of disconnected ""historical"" factoids which are never really tied together coupled with a mystery scheme to get rich. Throw in the usual cast of characters and predictable events and you end up with a mess.The good news (for fans of Loren), is that her Dad who was killed off 3 years before Vixen 03 (a very good book, BTW) has had a miraculous recovery from his death. I guess Vixen 03 was a ""dream"" (aka Bobby Ewing) - like the dream that we all have that Cussler could still put together a good read. Clive - TV programs use people called ""continuity checkers"" - you might want to investigate that! I also found the obligatory CC appearance at the end to be even more contrived than usual."
3,Running out of steam?,"I enjoyed this book, but Cussler seems to be losing his flair for action packed adventures. His latest work is less intense then the previous novels I have read and enjoyed. He hasn't gone totally down hill, but he has mellowed out. I like how he included the kids into the storyline, which he did better than Clancy towards the end. I found Trojan Odyssey difficult to get into, but enjoyed it anyway. I hope Clive hasn't lost his touch."
4,good read,"You can't go wrong with Cussler, He can't write a bad book. This one is not my all time favorite so I did not give it 5 starsDragon and Inca Gold and Sahara are better!"
4,Good Reading,I have read all of the Dirk Pitt novels and this ranks as one of the best. Read it and find out for yourself. Note to Professor Sue: Valhalla Rising comes between Atlantis and Trojan Odyssey
3,Question,"I'm not done with the book yet, so this is just a question, not a review. At the end of ""Atlantis Rising"" Al got engaged to the scholar of ancient languages, Pat. Yet in this book which was written later & takes place later, not only is there no mention of Al's wife, but he is described as single & a lady's man. Is there a book that falls between these two? Have I missed something? What happened to Pat? Is that ever explained? Thanks. I'll get back with a review when I've finished this."
2,Reads like a B- movie,"Melodrama, poor writing, extremely unbelievable action sequences and a massive once in a millenia storm. Am I describing a new Steven Seagal movie? No I'm talking about Clive Cussler's novel: ""Trojan Odyssey"". Which isn't to say that the novel was all bad. The alternative history detailed in the first few pages of the book had me hooked. There were also some well thought-out scenes where Cussler was able to demonstrate his considerable knowledge of marine wildlife and archeology. These items alone weren't enough to carry the book however.If you are looking for intelligent edge-of-your-seat storytelling I wouldn't recommend this book for you. Then again I, like most of us I think, enjoy a good B-movie once in a while."
3,Bye-bye to Dirk,"I read this book while on vacation fully aware that I would need to let my imagination run wild to be able to believe another one of Dirk Pitt's adventures but I had no idea that my imagination would need to stretch that far in order to even begin to believe this tale.Clive Cussler gives another performance of Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino, the dynamic duo of NUMA who go racing around the globe in search of the last evidence of Odysseus' Odyssey from the Trojan War while trying to stop the evil of a secret society of women from spreading throughout the world. Bottom line: typical Dirk Pitt theatrics.The end of the novel leaves the reader believing this is the end of the adventure career for Dirk and Al and one almost hopes it is. After nearly a 30 years career of being shot at, gunned down, and countless near-drownings, wouldn't you be ready to for a little R&R;? I'm ready just from trying to believe this story."
4,Genuis with a pen,Another entertaining Cussler book. I look forward to all his books. He knows how to keep your attention from the first to last page. Great writer.
4,Good read,"Cussler kept with his standard Pitt format, Lots of mind bending and tec stuff, If you like pitt,you will like this book"
2,"Don't start here, but give Clive a chance","This novel was a deep, jagged pothole in the road of Dirk Pitt's adventures, BUT PLEASE don't judge the rest of Clive's work by this stinker. Read 'Flood Tide,' 'Atlantis Found,' 'Valhalla Rising,' 'Black Wind' 'Treasure of Khan,'or any of the previous works to discover your love of the series and James Bond-like escapist fantasy. My absolute favorite is 'Atlantis Found,' which can't be beat for pure audacious story-telling and incredible set-pieces. This novel was an oddly boring snooze that was badly written and edited even worse, if it was indeed edited at all. Perhaps this is why Mr. Cussler now hires ""writing partners"" for all his works. Immediately after this, the books are much improved."
1,GAGGING SUPERLATIVES,"I picked up this book, remembering a few pleasurable volumes of the past. What I forgot is that I was in HIGH SCHOOL at the time! I found this book to be so fantastic, absurd, and boring that I could not finish it. Even a good book of the fantasy genre has a plausable fact upon which to build the story. This has none. I do not know how an adult reader could enjoy this type of work. On the other hand, I would recommend it to high school freshman and sophomore boys who might not have an interest in reading. It might be attractive to them. To others - - stay away. And with that, I will be silent as I would be embarrassed to admit I tried to read this book to any of my friends."
1,Nonsense,"I like a good thriller with a nod to history and other cultures. This wasn't one of those books. It was a bunch of nonsense, poorly written and with a weak plot, weak character development and nonsensical scenarios. The first and last of Cussler for me."
2,Please Stick With Dirk & Al.,"Why is the author slowly letting the superstars Dirk and Al fade away???? Dirk's children are very, very boring. Please stick with Dirk & Al. I am sure there are many capers and adventures still left for the two heros. Please, let the children become doctors or architects. :)"
1,"Oh Lord in Heaven, they're back!!","Just when I was starting to feel comfortable with watching MTV, there they are yet again: The Baha Men. I have to admit ""Who Let The dogs out"" is an ok song to dance to but the lyrics are so stupid...along with all that insane barking. If there's one thing I hate its bands that cannot face the fact that they're one-hit wonders. The only people who listened to ""Who Let The dogs Out"" were little children who like obnoxious music. Thankfully they didnt play their newer single (nor their hit from last year) on my local radio station which was probably a blessing. These guys need to realize that if they release another song and it doesnt get played, it isn't a hit. And that's what makes Baha Men One Hit Wonders. I would even reccomend *N Sync's newer album over this jumble of music, or so they call it."
2,Won't Somebody Make Them GO AWAY!??,"I could tell you how I feel about the Baha Men. Like, for example how I don't feel that barking and screaming ""WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?"" qualifies as music, or how every song they've ever put out sounds absolutely identical to every OTHER song they've ever put out, but instead, I'll let you know what I think of this CD.The Baha Men have put ""Move It Like This"" riding the wave of short-lived fame they received from ""Who Let the Dogs Out."" If you listen to this CD long enough (and oh gosh it's so long), you will eventually discover that every track on here is the same as the one before. They just scream to put lime in the coconut or move it like this a little louder in some places.Don't fall for it. I'd get Key West's (the band, not the place) album if I were looking for tropical sounding party music."
3,We dubbin',"A Reggae/Hip hop blend style that is good dance music. I bought this CD because I really liked the ""Best Years of our Lives"" song from Shrek. Unfortunately that is, in my opinion, the best song on this disk.The vocals are good but the rap blend doesn't work as well as it might and they use it *everywhere*. There is clearly a lot of fun here and that is my criteria for good dance music but the ""sound"" that started emerging in Best Years is only hinted at in the other pieces. With a bit more seasoning these guys should develop into a great dance band."
1,Buyer's Beware of Happy_Sellers,"Happy_sellers, who has this item listed, is dishonest, ships after the expected delivery date, and severely misrepresents the product. Buy at your own risk."
4,A mighty gut ending!,Katherine has been desperately wanting the finer things in life. What will she do when she has it all? You must read to find out!
5,The Reckoning,I have read all 3 books and they were great. I would read them again. I like reading about the Amish.
2,Disappointed in the editors.,"I am very disappointed in the editors of this series. Once you read the 3 books, you love the story. However, it is very obvious that the story was written as 1 story and the editors chopped it up into 3 books and charge you twice what one would have paid for the epic story in a large volume."
3,Third book a little too rushed,I enjoyed the first two books in the series but was disappointed in the last one the reason being I thought the ending was too rushed. I would have like to have seen less of Bishop Biler and Mary's courtship which too up several pages and more of the courtship of Daniel and Katherine/Katy which was only a few sentences. I think the author was in a rush to finish the book and just tacked that on the end. I would have liked to have the scene where she finally broke it off with Justin. I would have like to see her come to the conclusion that it would not work with Justin because Justin did not share her beliefs but we did not get that.This is the first series I have read by Beverly Lewis and not sure I am going to read any more if she is going to rush things in all her novels. A much better series is The Sisters of the Quilt series by Cindy Woodsmall.Sisters of the Quilt: The Complete Trilogy
3,The Reckoning,"I read the previous 2 in this series and, although I enjoyed this book, it was not as good as the previous 2. The ending was good though. Closure to an exciting beginning."
5,A worthwhile continuation of Katherine's experiences,"If you've read The Shunning and The Confession, you've got to follow up with this new title! As with the first two books in the series, this was a page-turner. While the previous titles left me with a negative feeling toward the Amish (in relation to their beliefs and practices), Lewis digs a little deeper into the hearts of the Amish characters in The Reckoning. In it, she shows that, though under the hand of the order, the men and women are truly individuals who can see the imperfections in the Amish beliefs but still revere the traditions. Also, it's good to see Katherine mature in The Reckoning. She opens her eyes to the world and to the Lord. Just as with the last two, I can't wait to see where Lewis takes Katherine/Katie in the next title in the series."
3,"An adequate, if rushed finale...","I thought that this book seemed a little rushed at the end. By about 1/2 way through, I knew what was going to happen at the end (if not earlier). I thought that it was well written, but some story lines were just dropped--for instance, we never know what Justin's reaction is to Katie's decision, and we never find out more about Katie's life change at the end.I did like how the Amish quilters were brought into the story. Also, I liked how Daniel was written in. However, I think that it is a little strange how, by the end of the book, a bunch of the Plain people are being ""saved"". As I said in one of my other reviews, I think there could be a little less preaching going on in the story, but it's ok.There were emotional sections of the book, but I think that there could possibly be one more book coming in the series. The book ended well, but there were still questions, in my mind..."
4,ends abruptly,"Have had the first two in this series on my bookshelf for years and finally decided to read them. Although I've enjoyed all three, this book dragged a bit in the middle and ended too abruptly without any explanations about Katherine/Katie's final decision about her relationships. Still the author really captures the Amish ways and has certainly peaked my curiousity about further selections. Also like the faith element she weaves into the story. Hopefully she has a follow up in mind on the characters portrayed in The Heritage of Lancaster County series. Have purchased October Song...that'll be my next one to read."
4,Window into Amish culture.,"Read the trilogy prior to a vacation in the heart of Lancaster Amish country. A very good insight into cultural aspects that are not readily visible during a visit. Like everyone else, I am captivated by the Amish, and Beverly Lewis gives a very good peek through the Amish window."
1,Ugh,"On the positive side, this book offers good insights into what is happening in our schools today. How Mr. Stormer slants that information is a bit hard to stomach.I am homeschooling my children and am always on the lookout for information to further support this decision. If I can bring myself to pick up the book again I think I'll find some more valid reasons to do so hiding amongst the ""real"" reasons for this books release.I think a more appropriate title would have been along the lines of ""How the evil, sinful homosexuals of the world are attempting to brainwash our children in our schools""Unless you share this very biased Christian view, the reading of this book is going to be very hard going.If you can take what you want and leave the rest, this book does have some value to offer in making clear what some of the problems are today with our school system."
4,great value,"Bought generator about 1 year ago, used it for first time this week thanks to Irene. Since Sunday at 2 am I am running two sump pumps, a refrigerator, a freezer, tv, cable, internet modem, and a couple of lamps, as well as occasional use of espresso machine and grinder, toaster, and charging phones, ipads and computers. The circuits have not overloaded, and it runs at least 10 hours in one full tank with all these things connected. Only downside is noise, and instructions are poor, but using it is very simple. Never had to pull crank more than once, and my basement is incredibly dry thanks to the uninterrupted use of the pumps. Highly recommended."
3,Noisy .... and that's before the muffler fell off,"I bought this generator right before Gustav blew into town. It did make my life tremendously easier (by powering my freezer, fridge and a small window unit), so I'm not going to bash it *too* much. But it is *not* of the best build quality that I've ever seen. I had to fight with it to keep it running properly (they're not kidding with they say too much or too little oil will automatically shut off the engine). But the highlight was when the muffler fell off at 3 am in the morning. If you thought it was noisy before, try running it without a muffler. I thought a freakin' freight train was coming through my back yard. I was able to finagle the muffler back on, but not without a good deal of hassle, sweat and mosquito bites. I ended up buying a second ""backup"" generator for this generator (which, as a bonus, will also give me more kilowatts during the next hurricane) since I just couldn't put my trust in this generator 100 percent."
4,Saved me from hurricane Irene...,"I overnight-ed it to save my basement from Irene. I knew i would loose power and without my sump pump running, i am in big trouble. Packaging was good, assemble was very simple. But three golden screws drop out from the generator, could not figure out where they came from. May be extras. It started in the third pull and ran all night and saved my basement.These were few issues :1. The generator would not run without the choke being in on position. It shuts off when i move it to close. Manual says I should gradually move it to close as the engine warms up but even after 13 hrs, it did not work.2. Fuel Gauge did not work. It is stuck to one side and not operational.3. Bad customer service. I called 3 times, never got through. on the 4th time went to answering machine. Left message no one called back.4. ETQ website is useless."
3,"Arrived damaged, damage not from shipping","The unit arrived and looked to be in good condition. I thought about waiting to put oil and gas in it, but decided I'd better try it out before I really need it. Good thing I did as it began leaking gas everywhere. Upon further inspection I found a gash on the bottom of the gas tank. Where the damage is it is obvious it did not occur in shipping. It was damaged at the factory before assembly. A replacement gas tank is being mailed to me, hopefully this will be the only problem I have and the generator works good."
3,Not so good of a deal!,"The generator in itself is just what I needed.The 1st,unit, upon arival was damaged to the point of not being safe to opperate.(damaged fuel delivery system, broken carb.& fuel tank) Amazon was very quick to respond by shipping another unit. After two weeks of waiting I finally received the second unit which was also damaged. Not as seriously as the first one. I am now in contact with the number included on the packaging to obtain service,It too needs a fuel tank to replace the damaged one on the second unit I received. Still no joy!I couldn't recomend this brand to anyone because of my experiance, inconvieniance and disapointment so far.John Kola"
1,BROKEN ON ARRIVAL,"THIS GENERATOR ARRIVED BROKEN. I CALL EASTERN TOOL & EQUIPMENT AND WAS TOLD THAT I COULD NOT SEND IT BACK, THAT THEY WOULD SEND ME A REPLACEMENT PART. I ASKED FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO REPLACE THE PART, THEY DID NOT SEND ANY. I REPLACED THE PART, BUT IT WOULD NOT GENERATE ANY ELECTRICITY. I PURCHASED ANOTHER BRAND LOCALLY WHICH HAD BRACKETS ATTACHED THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE ETQ FROM GETTING BROKEN IN SHIPPING IF THEY HAD THEM INSTALLED. DON'T BUY THIS GENERATOR IF IT IS GOING TO BE SHIPPED. AMAZON.COM TOOK CARE OF MY PROBLEM. THANKS AMAZON YOU STILL WILL GET MY BUSINESS. C. HENSLEY"
2,2 damaged units,"I wish I could recommend this unit but both samples I received from Amazon were damaged. The second was worse than the first due to a broken motor mount. I really wasn't looking for another repair project especially on a brand new product. Amazon issued a refund without any issue. I'm very impressed with Amazon customer service, they are first rate. It seems silly for the manufacturer not to modify the packaging after 3 years of complaints about shipping damage. This has got to be costing them some serious money replacing or scrapping these units."
4,It's OK for the price,"OK, I purchased this a month ago from Amazon. Delivered by the UPS, package was up side down, no manual and all the bolts and nuts dropped around, and box is damaged. Surprisingly the generator was OK with just a little dent on the front panel. I got 20 minute to put everything on, no problem with fueling the oil. Got it turn on in the first pull. However, it was rough. I went to the internet and download the manual to see the trouble shooting. It doesn't help much with how you set up the choke. I have to read my Honda Power washer to set this properly. Got 120V and 240V from those receptacles, How ever I don't put any load on it yet. It's OK for the money."
4,Good generator so far,"I received this generator and it was not damaged. I can see why others had a different experience, the packing is pretty lacking. I put the wheel kit on and put oil in it and it started right up. I couldn't find in the owner's manual where it said how much oil to put in it so that was annoying - it was less than a quart. I put in a Reliance Controls generator switch ($140) on my house and ran a refridgerator, freezer, water pump, and a few lights with it. I also used it to power the air conditioner and a light in my horse trailer. It starts OK. For the money it is a good generator. It's not too noisy, but it is a little loud for camping."
3,Read everything or it will kill you,"Paid extra to get it next day, Amazon Prime rocks. Read everything except maintenance before starting. Starts up and notice gas is pouring out of the bottom of carburetor. Turns out the fuel draining screw was loose and fell off on start-up. Thanks God I noticed it immediately and shut it off, otherwise I might not be here writing this. Also filling the engine oil is a pain, need to buy a long flex-neck funnel."
4,nice product,"This is a very good product for the money. I recommend changing the oil frequently until the engine is broken in. I ran it for an hour than changed the oil, I did that twice, than again at 5 hours. The only problem I had is that one of the outlets had neutral and hot wire switched. You can pick up a little tester at a home improvement store for a couple bucks to determine this. customer service never responded to my countless emails about this. It wasnt a big deal to remove the front panel and switch the wires. the only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is due to the no response from customer service. I sure hope I never need to contact them for any reason in the future! Great product. also if your going to keep fuel in it, you should add a stabilizer such as sta-bil in order to keep deteriorating fuel from damaging carburetor and inside of tank. You wont be disappointed with this product. I am very pleased with mine"
5,Great investment & piece of mind,Excellent product for the money. I use it as a backup generator and it's always ready and willing! Starts right up with one pull. Perform good routine maintenance and no doubt you'll be able to count on this generator.
3,TG4000 generator,"Received this generator very quickly, there was no damage from shipping, put on the wheels, filled it with oil and gas and it started up very easily. Starter pull handel is in an awkward position, but, it pulls with ease and starts right away so I can live with this."
2,Good engine.,"I ordered one of these generators to use with my travel trailer when I'm out at the track with no electric hook ups. I received 2 units, both units fired up on the first pull of the cord. They are quieter than most generators that I've heard, however they're not even close to a Honda Inverter genverator. The generator on both units did not function correctly, it was running at 40Hz instead of 60Hz and the voltage regulation was horrible, dropping to 104V with a 1600 Watt A/C unit running, this about 1/2 the rated load of 3250 W. After the 2nd unit I gave up and asked for a refund. I'll find something else to use. I WILL GIVE AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE 5 STARS for their help through this whole process, they were expediant with the 2nd unit and the eventual refund."
1,Not for long term use...,"Bought this product about a year or so ago and stowed away unopened to use during our next Hurricane. When Ike blew in I cranked this generator up and it worked fine for about four days. We did use it 6-8 hours per day, but in the end the motor gave out after about 40 hours of use. I can only recommend this if you are going to give it a light work out..other than that the old addage of you get what you pay for applies."
1,Damaged - no user manual,The generator arrived damaged. There was no user manual. The hardware (that normally would come in closed plastic bags) was strewn on the bottom of the box outside opened plastic bags. The fuel hose connecting the gas tank and the carburetor was disconnected. Buy this generator only if you are willing to put up with a lot of headache and are mechanically adept.
4,ETQ4000watt generator,"This generator although not as quiet as a honda sure does the job. When I first got it, put gas and oil in it and started in one pull."
4,Good for the money,"Powered the fridge, freezer and furnace during our recent outage in New England. It did have a tendency to stop running once in a while (started back up easily though). Clearly not a high end unit, but very pleased for the price.Follow up: One year later, this generator is still working well. I keep gas stabilizer in the tank and run the unit dry after each use with the convenient gas switch."
1,garbage,"Bought this generator last dec for camping, started and ran for 2 minutes and then put away, when i tried it again all it would do is miss, and blow white smoke, i called eastern tool twice and was put on hold for about 10 minutes each time with no one coming back to me, when i drained the oil from the crankcase it was full of gas, terrible generator, save your money"
4,"A nice generator, but........","I purchased the smaller 1200w ETQ generator several years ago, and was generally pleased with it. This one (3250/4000w) came with a broken air cleaner housing, and a leaking fuel tank. I called ETQ and they promptly sent repair parts. The generator runs good, and is very quiet (huge muffler). I got it to run a 220v water pump, construction site equipment, and my house in an emergency. So far, so good."
3,generator,"I purchased this to be used in an emergency. It was a good price for the listed watts. It has since doubled in price. The supersaver ship was a big selling point also. I had a lot of trouble getting one that did not have broken motor mounts. I returned and exchanged four units until I got one that was not physicaly damaged. No customer service problems, but it was a hastle. I keep meaning to test run it but I have not yet had the time. Hope it actually works. It looks pretty good just sitting there."
1,never buy these generator!!. I bought it and when I open the box was totally destoyed.,never buy these generator!!. I bought it and when I open the box it was totally destroyed to many parts were broken in pieces.I could not returnet because i bought it from VENEZUELA.
4,Still to test,We purchased this as a precaution against power cuts in bad weather for two reasons. Firstly my husband uses a non invasive ventilator to sleep with and secondly because we have a salt water fish tank which needs constant power. It is still in the box right now as shortly after delivery I had surgery so I can not lift anything heavy and it is too heavy for my husband to attach the wheels on his own as he is disabled. I have no doubt after reading previous reviews that it will do everything we need it to and more. Will add to this review once we have tried it.
2,REVIEW OF GENERATOR,"THE ORDERING PROCESS WAS A BIT CONFUSING DUE TO IMMEDIATE CHECKOUT WHICH AUTOMATICLY ADDED THE SHIPPING WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FREE. AFTER A FEW PHONE CALLS AND A PROMISE TO REMOVE THE FIRST ITEM AND BEING TOLD TO PLACE A NEW ORDER I NOW WAS GETTING TWO GENERATORS ONE WITH FREE SHIPPING AND THE SECOND ONE WITH SHIPPING. ANOTHER CALL WAS MADE AND AFTER A THREAT THAT THEY WOULD ONLY DO THIS ONE TIME THEY REMOVED THE SECOND GENERATOR WITH SHIPPING AND CREDITED MY CREDIT CARD. THE GENERATOR ARRIVED AND AFTER OPENING THE BOX I NOTICED TWO MOTOR MOUNTS WERE BROKEN. I HAVE CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AS OF TWO MONTHS I HAVE NOT RECEIVED NEW MOTOR MOUNTS. PERHAPS AMAZON CAN HELP SPEED UP MY MOTOR MOUNT REPLACEMENT. THANKING YOU IN ADVANCE, ROBERTPS: I AM HOPING THE GENERATOR STARTS AFTER I REPLACE THE MOTOR MOUNTS"
4,Great Idea,"I am so glad someone came up with something like this. The only thing I didn't realize is it's only big enough for the long skinny power strips. I didn't realize it until I was about to use it. No big deal though, just had to change my power strip to a long skinny one."
3,mehhh its ok,"I really like the idea behind this power cover, but it really just doesnt get the job done if you have large plugs plugged it (say from a printer or something). It will not close. Also, if you only have small ones and do close it, it is near impossible to get open again to change our plugs. So IDK. If you are using it in a place where you wont be moving plugs around and have no large plugs, I would say buy it. Otherwise... find something else."
2,Could not close the door or it would shut the power off!,"I have a basic single row power strip, and i couldn't shut the smaller side door or it would depress the power switch... therefore making this completely useless to me.The snap buttons are hard to open and close, so it would be good to keep little fingers out, but i just couldnt use it for my power strip.The stip i have is SIMILAR to this one,<...>but not exactly the same. Mine is dark color and newer looking with spots labeled ""adapter"" so you can plug in large plugs and not lose any outlet space."
3,helps somewhat,"This item does not fit the powerstrip I have perfectly, but the powerstrip does fit in it. It's kind of a pain to snap closed, after trying a couple times I just gave up, especially since I had to re-open it to re-plug one of the plugs that came loose as I wrestled with it the first time. I would say it works in slowing my baby's access to the bad part of the outlet and I do feel safer with the plugs tucked in. I would buy this again unless I saw another model that looked like it would function and fit better."
3,"Only fits your standard plugs, room for improvements.","It was a pain to get all three clasps to close the first couple of times, but once you get the hang of it, it's not that bad. And I had to use a tie wrap to keep the cords together so I could close it. I like it because it keeps my son from playing with the surge protector. The slit on top is just big enough for them to stick their fingers in, but they included 3 or 4 outlet covers so they can't play with the unused outlets. I hate having to take the time to pry the thing open every time I need to plug something in, but I'll take the hassle over my kid shocking himself.The main downside to this product is that it only fits standard plugs. My mom couldn't plug in the box for her clicker lamp and I can't plug in my cell phone charger, or any other bulky plug. If it accommodated those types of plugs, I'd give it 5 stars. Overall, I'd still recommend it to others."
3,Not so great,"We have two power strip covers at our house--one by safety 1st and the other by Mommy's Helper. The Safety 1st cover far exceeds the quality and durability of the Mommy's Helper cover (whose buckles looked like they might break if opened too often.) I like the Safety 1st cover because it allows for adjustability in length and is very wide inside, as well as looking quite sturdy. Wish I had purchased the Safety 1st version first, I never would have ordered this one."
5,Did what I needed!,Plenty of space for bulky plugs...ample room for just about any spike strip I'd imagine. Bought it to keep my 20month old from playing with his cord friends. I'd recommend it for others.
4,Performs desired function,"These have worked very well for us. We have power strips of a couple different sizes in our house, and this fits over all of them. It is large enough to cover all the bulky plugs we have plugged into the strips as well. I was surprised to read another reviewer found this too small. I think the cover should work for most single-wide power strips; it probably wouldn't work for a powerstrip with two rows of outlets. I found it relatively easy to open and close. I don't think my baby daughter will be able to open them herself, and she won't be able to reach her fingers in and shock herself. I now own at least five of these."
2,Not tall enough,This contaption doesn't accommodate charger plugs or anything larger than a standard two prong. It isn't big enough. So we can't use it many places.
2,Partially does the job but huge pain,"Isn't large enough to cover large power strips but even more annoying, you have to break your nails to open it. I u derstand it shoukd be difficult for a baby to open but the little plastic tabs will break your nails trying to open. Must be a better option out there"
4,Does the Job!,"I bought this to keep my 2 sons out of the computer cords. The power strip and all the cords seem to fit well, except for the plug to our router/modem (hence the 4-star rating). It is too wide for the safety cover to snap shut. So...I will be pluging the modem into the wall outlet (which is behind the compter desk & out of reach) and everything else into this power stip safety cover!! It def. helps keep the kids safe from exposed outlets!! I highly recommend."
2,Too Small,"I have several different types of power strips in my house, and this thing is too small for all except one of them. I bought two of these and I cannot use the second one now, and I don't know what to do about the 3 power strips in my house that will not fit. Also, you cannot have anything with a large plug, or it won't shut (for example, my iPhone plug won't fit). I wish it was just a little bit larger. It is hard to open, but I guess that's good. The picture with the product open is deceptive, there is no way a big AC converter plug would fit inside this thing."
2,Terrible! Fingers can reach the outlets!!,"This is a very useless item. It doesn't protect children from sticking their fingers inside the cover. This is easily done even by myself through the top where the cords are supposed to come out. A child can easily unplug anything inside the cover and get their fingers inside, which completely defeats it's purpose."
2,I'm unimpressed,"This is challenging to get open and closed for the adult in the equation. There are a series of little pegs that must fit into little holes to get it to latch. But they are quite challenging to get to line up correctly and heaven forbid you need to get it back open. Now you would think that that's the point of the power strip cover, right? Except the hole that allows the cords to come out the top is so wide that my 9 month old just sticks his hand right inside and can put a finger in the socket. It does come w a couple outlet plugs for the extra slots in your power strip, I was just hoping this would work a wee bit better. If all you really need is to prevent your child from unplugging things from your power strip, than this will work for you."
2,Won't fit iPhone/iPod/MacBook adapters!!,"The opening on this is too narrow to accommodate iPhone/iPod/MacBook adapters. If the cover were taller, it wouldn't be an issue because the whole adapter could fit inside, but it's not. It's just too short, even for the smallest of the Apple adapters. So I had to return this anyway, but if I'd kept it, I would only have wanted to use it for a power strip that I never need to add/remove plugs on -- the tabs to open the cover are a serious pain...and ironically would be easier to open if my hands were smaller."
4,A must need for houses with little ones.,"This is simple to install, but great at keeping my little ones safe, from playing with the cords. Great price. It also has helped make our spider web of cords coming from the TV, and gaming systems more manageable."
2,"Cheap, flimsy, not what I expect from a ""safety"" product.","I wouldn't call this much of a safety product. The plastic is very flimsy and the locking tabs aren't that hard to open. I would expect a better quality product from something marketed as a ""safety"" item. It's fine as a deterrent, but nothing I would waste money on again."
2,Doesn't mix in well,"I used this in my smoothies a few times and then just gave up using it. It clumps up and doesn't mix in at all even with a blender. I recommend you just buy medamucil if your looking for something with fiber, it definitely mixes better than this product and it's made from psyllium husks."
3,kinda gross,"This becomes VERY thick when you add it to water - I have taken it a couple of times - I have no idea if it does anything, because it seriously grossed me out and I stopped taking it. I would recommend putting it in a smoothie - adding to just water is like drinking apple sauce."
5,One of the best!,"This would have to be one of my DID's. The single, 'If you want me to stay' just will not be ignored! It was similar to Dr. John's ""Right Place, Wrong Time"" in just the way it came across. California soul! Sly was leading the way at this point. The whole album had that same vibe going, right down to the last track! With the bonus stuff, you can see more of the mind of a genius. This would be the last, unfortnately, even sounding Sly & the Family Stone record. Some stuff on Warners', some disco-it was the late 70's OK? Some attempts in the early 80's, though his brother said he is still composing....who knows, maybe he can re emerge like Brian Wilson did. Here's hoping....Sly, we miss ya!"
4,Good... sort of!,"I really think a person needs to read a more in depth book on lucid dreaming before they buy this book. This book does touch on quite a few aspects of lucid dreaming in a condensed type of way, and even covers ones that aren't found in other books. This can be good for some people, and bad for others. It all depends on one's personality.I found it helpful, in that it gives you lessons that you need to complete. This feels like having someone standing over you, making sure you complete your homework. A good book for procrastinators!?For what you pay for it, and what you get out of it, I say its a buy."
2,Rushed and not very informative,"As an experienced Oneironaut and somebody who is very educated on the subject, I don't really like this book. I got this back when I was starting out with lucid dreaming and had been for about 6 months. This book was very demanding and the tasks it was saying to do could not always be done in one day. It pretty much expects you to lucid dream within about 10 days, which is incredibly unrealistic.I really do not like this book. To me, it sounds like the person wasn't that educated on the subject. Please, don't waste your money on this. It really does not include a lot of information and the title makes it very misleading.Definitely go by Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen La Berge. It is a much better book."
3,Not as easy as you think,"Purchased this a month ago and although It has some good ideas some are easier then others to make happen. You'll be hard pressed to achieve this in 30 days more like 30 weeks or more. Most, but not all, is available in You Tube videos. If I find a dramatic change I'll try to add to this review but at this time I don't hate it or love it. By the way I bought this in the hopes of improving my musicianship for anyone out there who thinks of doing the same but it should help in any cerebral skill."
2,Meh...,I only read the book about half way through. I would not recommend it for anyone with just interest in the subject of lucid dreaming. Some of the tasks described in the book are just impractical. About a solid 90% of what is given in this book is not necessary in order to lucid dream. Only get this if you want a quick supplement to something else way more in depth on the topic and/or techniques.
4,Lucid dreams in 30 days,The book arrived shortly after I bought it. It was in good shape. The book had useful information that other books on the subject doesn't have plus the basics from other sources.
1,There are far better books on the subject,"If you're looking for a serious book about lucid dreaming, this isn't it. The authors included a few tips they learned from legitimate dream researchers, such as Stephen LaBerge. Unfortunately, most of this book is pure fluff, concluding with instructions on how to use lucid dreaming to promote ESP and out-of-body experiences. Oh, PLEASE! I'm surprised the authors didn't suggest putting aluminum foil on your head and sleeping under a pyramid.If you're serious about lucid dreaming, pick up a book written by legitimate dream or sleep researchers who know what they're talking about.BTW, I've been accused by some of working for Stephen LaBerge. Although I am aware of his work, I do not work for him nor with him. In fact, I've never even met the man. I'm just a regular guy who bought this book and was VERY disappointed."
3,Looking for a few good uses,"I go through lunch boxes like these a lot. So throwing them away doesn't break my heart. My wife has a tendency to leave them at work with food in them and the box gets the foul stench inbeded in it almost impossible to get out. So to the trash it goes. What I noticed with these is after one or two uses the lids were not fitting on. The product it self only has a few uses regardless any carelessness. These are still too expensive for only getting a few good uses out of. Considering these are hand washed, and have not been in a dishwasher dry cycle I never imagined the lids to warp as the did."
2,Don't use them in the freezer,"The things I like about these containers are that you can nest them and they seal really well.Although Ziploc advertises that you can use their containers safely in the freezer, almost every Ziploc container we've put in the freezer has broken. They usually break right at the bottom corners. If you do use them in the freezer anyway, they seem less likely to break if they're filled with fluids than if they're filled with solid foods."
3,too big for Pottery Barn lunchbox,"In my case, it didn't work, so we end up buying a PlanetBox which has its own bag and it wasn't plastic. Change of heart about plastic after I bought them."
2,already cracking,"These have already started cracking. I hand wash only, no dishwasher. So, I am not thrilled with the quality.We do use them daily for school lunches. Love that we can fit them in the lunch boxes and they don't leak, but I wish they would last longer!"
5,GREAT TO HAVE AROUND!,THESE ZIPLOC CONTAINERS ARE GREAT TO HAVE AROUND. WE USE THEM FOR LEFTOVERS & FOR SENDING LEFTOVERS HOME WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS. HANDY TO USE FOR TAKING LUNCH TO THE OFFICE AND A MILLION OTHER USES.
4,"Doesn't fit my ""31"" lunch box.","I bought this because I was inspired by the ""Bento"" lunch boxes shown on Pinterest.These Ziplock containers seem to be fairly water tight. At least my cottage cheese didn't soak into my sandwich and fruit. It didn't warp when washed top rack of dishwasher.My biggest disappointment is they are too large to set flat in my ""31"" brand lunch box. They are also too large even for my husband's ""6 pack"" style lunch pail.Still I'll use them and enjoy the cutesy factor...anything to brighten up brown bag lunches."
4,Good,These are really good. I have had one crack but they are still pretty nice. They aren't too big or too small
5,Good deal!,"I prefer using glass storage as much as possible but once in a while when I have to freeze something, I prefer these so I dont have to worry about it. Once they have been well used, I can recycle them too. Of course they stack more neatly in my cabinet than the glass locks.This was a very good deal even without the subscribe and save. I have used rubbermaid until now but am very satisfied switching to ziploc. I especially like the measure marking on the boxes. Very good package, every piece in it is equally useful. Glad to recommend."
4,Great Buy,Good containers for a great price. There are different sizes great for your leftovers and for lunch. I bought them especially for storing my husband's lunch.
5,Good containers for lunch,"There are plenty of things to do with this. Very nice for salads. The little bowls stay in the lid really well, which I was a little worried about."
4,Practical & little flimsy,"Purchased for school sack lunches. Practical for compartmentalizing small meals, a bit large for most lunch box/bags, will crack easily around rim at compartment borders."
5,Stig Rossen - This Is the Moment: Live at Tivoli,"I saw a performance of this album on the PBS station in my area and thoroughly enjoyed it so much that I not only have the video of his concert but now have his 2-cdalbum of that performance. Regardless of the song(s) he sings, he has a voice so versatile that every performance is very enjoyable. This album has been added to my""favorites"" collection as I continue to check for his next project, hopefully in the near future."
2,Doesn't work?,I have been searching for the knife that creates the long strips of lime/lemon that go in a martini. This is supposed to be that knife but I found it very difficult to use and would not recommend it. There were no directions. I purchased two knives - one for a friend and had to alert her that I couldn't get the knife to work properly.
2,Rootabaga Stories,"The formatting of this story is very poor. The stories are charming, but given to changing times, I am think children would have difficulty in relating/understanding the stories."
3,"Interesting, but very strange","My wife and I love and highly recommend Carl Sandburg's other book ""The Wedding Procession of the Rag Doll and the Broom Handle"". This is a picture book that is very funny, and was one of her favorite books growing up as a kid.Rootabaga stories doesn't have any pictures, and is a bit strange. Don't get me wrong, the author is brilliant and the writing is interesting, but it wasn't a fun kid's book like we were expecting."
5,Excellent book and cassette set,"This book is very accessible. Tablature is clearly marked in pretty calligraphy, and the cassette is a good quality recording."
4,Cool Tunes,"The songs selected and arranged are very tuneful, easy to sing and play. This is an excellent assortment of music from the time period!"
5,Ancient eastern desires meet western high technology!,"""Researched and written by the same brilliant author responsible for 'Invisible Marijuana and Mushroom Gardens', 'Hydroponic Heroin' details a thorough schematic that even a drug-free blackthumb can successfully utilise.Although the briefest of histories regarding opium and its respective derivatives opens up this manual, all the other aspects are fleshed out so as to include nearly any and all information needed to carry out such an endeavour. The risks of addiction, the indescribable pain pain of kicking the habit, how to obtain without problems the materials required, how to sprout the seeds and care for the plants, how to secure the growing room from the prying eyes and pesky praetorians (the latter of which are perpetually pursuing avenues that offer easy targets by which they justify their measly ""careers""), rules and repercussions regarding the risk of possession, dosages, overdose antidotes and so forth."
2,An over-priced book.,"This thin book has some interesting info for anyone interested in growing poppies themselves. I do believe it is very much overpriced though, and I would not order it, if I had it to do again."
4,Perfect reading for a lazy summer afternoon,This was a delightful and quick mystery to read....which makes it ideal for an afternoon at the beach. The main character is a delighful 60 year old lady gardener who turns sleuth when she finds a body and becomes determined to find the killer. Along the way she reunites with an old flame and what happens next requires actually reading the book. The ending is possibly predictable depending perhaps on the number of mysteries you've read. But overall it was well worth an afternoon of relaxing reading.
5,Cute book,We just adopted a beagle from a rescue for my 8 year old son. I got this book for him since he is a reader and he wanted more of the set. It was a little easy for him (he is a 3rd grader and high reader) but it still kept his attention and he was ready for more.
5,Sarinas Book Review,"Absolutely LucyAbsolutely Lucy is a book by Ilene Coper. This book has a true message to it. This message is that friends come in all shapes, colors, sizes, and even species. Also that friends help build corage and ease your pain.In Absolutely Lucy a boy named Bobby turns from a shy boy with no friends to an outcoming boy with many friends. All of this just from Lucy. I guess you can even say Lucy is a hero!!! Lucy and Bobby end up meeting someone named Mr. Davis. Lucy saved his life!!! WHAT A HERO!!! GO LUCY!!!So as you can see Lucy is a great dog and Bobby is learning to live off his life the best he can. Lucy is such a great dog she is helping everyone.Absolutely Lucy is a fun and enjoying book for kids of all ages. It will get kids to want to read on. Read the fun and enjoying book Absolutely Lucy and read the fun adventures of Bobby, Lucy, and Mr.Davis. Its absolutely the best book ever! I would!!!By:Sarina"
1,Jenna,Good. This book is an amazing book. It is exciting and fun. I love this book. It is very good.
1,Unsatisfied,I bought this product and within a week it broke. I took it to get fixed and to get this product fixed it cost more than the bracelet. This is the first product that I have been dissatisfied with and probably will not buy any more jewelry from Amazon.Com.
4,Turn Right off Damascus Road,"I would compare this girl's voice to any opera singer, she is that good! This is a fine example of 90s mix of ccm pop and hip hop, with plenty of timely messages set to music. A rich blend of keyboards and dancable melodies take you from start to finish."
3,Good but not complete,"I bought this CD & was extremely disappointed to hear the Medley of ""Tell Me How Do You Feel"" ""Don't Want No Woman"" & ""My Friends"" was cut short. Frosty does a fantastic drum solo & then Lee does some amazing stuff on the B-3 to close out the song & it's all gone! I had the original recording of this from the Lee Michaels album but the cassette broke & I haven't been able to find it anywhere. The rest of the album is fantastic but I sure wish they hadn't cut what I feel was some of Lee's best organ playing."
3,Disappointing,"Lots of good vintage Lee Michaels cuts on this one, but cutting the ""Tell Me How Do You Feel"" medley in half was unforgivable. It's not as if Frosty's solo was the greatest thing since Buddy Rich - editing that down would have been perfectly okay. But LM's entrance after the solo, and the finale of ""My Friends"", was arguably the best moment on the entire ""Lee Michaels"" LP.Very disappointing."
5,"""ALMOST"" THE BEST","LEE MICHAELS WAS SOMETHING ELSE IN THOSE EARLY SEVENTIES...BUT WHAT A SOMETHING ELSE....THOSE ORGAN RIFFS WHICH REPLACED THE USUAL SCREAMING GUITAR RIFFS OF THE TIME, AND WITH HIS SIDEKICK DRUMMER KEEPING TIME, IT MAKES FOR A WONDERFUL REMINISCING OF YEARS LONG AGO. THE ONLY THING MISSING IS HIS VERSION OF ""WILLIE AND THE HAND JIVE"". OTHER THAN THAT, YOU ""KNOW WHAT I MEAN""..."
3,Not bad but....,"It's a great shame truly unique artists like Lee Michaels are now an almost extinct genre-replaced by a load of ""radio friendly"" ""hey Chuck, this'll sell a million"" cookie cutter rubbish. A very good collection of rock/soul music. Recommended."
3,DIDN'T INCLUDE MY FAVORITES BUT STILL OK.,"I listened often to some of Lee Michaels' LP's when they were initially issued.While this compilation does not convey the same 'mood' the original album track orders managed to do, it was nevertheless enjoyable to be able to listen again to some fondly remembered songs, especially ""Do You Know What I Mean"". Especially nice too to be able to hear a clean sound without the scratchy sounds of old vinyl!"
2,Not A True Lee Michaels Fan,"I purchased this product to obtain just 3 songs I could'nt find elsewhere. Their is no question about Lee's musical writing, producing, and multi-talented instrument capabilities. For a true fan I would have given it a 5 star rating. But, as I said, I just wanted 3 songs of his to add to my library; of those I would give him a 5 star rating; excellent."
5,douche bag,the person who wrote the last reveiw hasnt a clue in life and obviosley hearing impaired..the album rocks...what would drive a person to write such negative things ..you need a new hobbie ..try golfing the critic thing isnt working out ...you need to have good taste first
1,BUFF BAGWELL?!?! WTF??!?!?!?,"This set may be the lowest selling dvd set by WWE. It does not sound very good and most of this stuff can be seen on You Tube. But Buff Bagwell on a WWE cover? WHAT THE HELL?!? Do sets over Chris Jericho, Ricky Steamboat, and so many others."
3,Legends of Wrestling,"I didnt want to get this set but the match listing was pretty strong. You can get bonus dvds of this set exclusively at Best Buy. Its the same set up with lots more bonus matches but none really caught my eye. Maybe i'll try to get the Hogan/Backlund set too see what they say of Hogan. Back to this set though. You can watch these for free on You Tube (sorry for all the plugs, just call me Mick Foley), so you'd buy it just for matches. I watched Heatseekers, disc three. It sounded good but the panelist-Eric Bischoff, Michael Hayes, Mick Foley, and Jerry Lawler along with moderator Jim Ross, discuss wrestlers who were difficult to deal with. The match list is great but the show itself was a mess. All four men tried to get in words and Mick Foley just liked everyone. Hayes looked at Bischoff like he wanted to smack him most of the time. It was a complete mess and I really didnt feel like watching the other two yet."
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with this DVD. Thought it would show the matches itself, but all they do is talk about the matches. Don't get it for kids."
2,Looking for the authentic earlier recordings...,"Disappointing album; most of the recordings are from their twilight (presumably playing to British tourists in Benidorm and the like)in which they rehash Spanish and Mexican songs with Mantovani-like orchestral accompaniment. Too bad because their earlier stuff (Choguy, La Galopera, Paraguay) was brilliantly performed - and much more authentic.I'd keep looking for their earlier recordings."
5,This is not the Basis for a Movie!,"The reviews of some of Richard Burton's books, as well as those of other 19th century explorers, strike me as hilarious. It's as if people expect that these books to be written in a style that would make for some blockbuster Hollywood movie. This is the REAL DEAL people! Burton didn't write this or other books with the idea in mind of entertaining 20th century couch potatoes starved for action. Apparently people's attention spans get seriously taxed when detailed observations about a country's people and culture are brought into play. When in fact, what could be more important in a first hand account of previously unexplored (at least by Europeans) regions? If you want action at every turn and tailor made story lines then stick with Tom Clancy novels or some such. Maybe faketion turns some would be adventurers on, but not me. This book is a truly incredible account of a larger than life adventure!"
3,"Good, but not as described.","I have nothing negative to say about this measuring shot glass, other than that I ordered them specifically because they were described as a 2 ounce measure, but they turned out to be only 1.5 ounce, which is fine if you don't need 2 ounces. I don't appreciate this turn of events."
1,Does not even compare to the books!,This DVD was a total waste of money. The plot was boring and the children acting in the movie had bad attitudes. Not at all what we expected from the Sugar Creek Gang. I'm glad we only bought this title. Had this DVD been good we were planning to purchase the entire series.
5,Love it!,"This is a great little vice. Perfect for soldering small PCBs or perfboard projects. I haven't attached the base to anything solid yet, but would advise the user to do so as the base is quite light and I found myself having to wedge it against something more solid in order to accurately solder components."
4,"I like it, B+","The unit is heavy enough so you don't need anything else to keep it stable on the table. Without weighing it I'd guess a good, or close to, pound of metal to keep it stable. The bottom clamp holds the head in place very well.The only complaint that I have that keeps me from giving the item a full 5 stars is the fact that the tops of the clamp does not come together. The upper third or so of the clamp has a gap that increases as it approaches the top which makes holding small items securely impossible, such as holding the flange of a DB-9 connector vertically."
4,just as good as the bigger models,"When I got this vise, I screwed it down to a scrap piece of wood to give a more stable base. Now it is the perfect vise for holding miniatures, models, and circuit boards."
4,Great if you're studying the subject!,"I needed some field study recordings for an ethnomusicology seminar I was preparing. All of Lomax's recordings fit that bill. However, if you're looking for something for pleasurable listening, well...you might fight this a little rough around the edges! Remember: these recordings are the real thing: untrained musicians and singers, not always singing in tune, not always playing in tune. In addition, the recordings are done using older technologies (between the 30s and the 60s).That, of course has its charm, but I think I would recommend it primarily to students of ethnomusicology."
3,Not an FS design related book but...,"This book is not a filesystem design or specification book. The explainations are high level overviews of the workings of various filesystems. It explains VFS and how the kernel abstracts various filesystems, what the basic design principles of each are and nothing more. The title of this book is somewhat misleading as it sounds like a book for programmers (reason I purchased it), but is more geared towards sysadmins.A better title would have been ""Filesystems Explained"" or something of the sort. I guess ""Design and Implementation"" sounded cool...."
1,100% Cashmere shawl sheds like a dog,"I ordered the large 100% Cashmere Shawl. Label says ""Pashmina Boutique"" 100% Cashmere. After wearing it 2 or 3 times, it sheds terribly, pills and looks awful. Plus, about a week after I ordered from this company, I got a message that my credit card info had been compromised by this vendor's lack of security.Avoid this company."
1,disapointing,The scarf is lovely and warm but my son can't wear it because it sheds white on his black jacket. I've tried various treatments to prevent the shedding but none work. So the scarf stays in the closet.
5,Wonderful book,"Fezler has worked with Kroger so his bona fides are impeccable. This book is very unusual. It essentially tells you how to focus on imagery in self-hypnosis rather than merely emphasise verbal self-suggestion. But although it is on one hand an excellent book on self-hypnosis per se (written in a very user-friendly tone), it's also something else. It's really a manual on how to build up the skill of mental imagery brick by brick. It's quite extraordinary. This book has nothing to do with New Age nonsense (though Fezler raises some open-minded questions), but it really does feel a little bit like a manual for cabalistic magicians, in as much as it tells you exactly what to do to develop vivid pictures. Indispensable. The other book you should get is Simpkins and Simpkins, 'Effective Self-Hypnosis'. The best book out there with this one a very useful and exhilirating complement."
5,Amazing!!,"I've had this book for years and love it. The ""Bluebird"" visualization for time distortion really works! I enjoy every one of these visualizations and they all have some benefit for me. I wish he was still actively writing. I'd love to take a class from him."
4,I wish label info was listed online,"Received my order on time; no problem with delivery. I do wish, though, that for all health products, the label info would be printed online, including ingredients and warnings. This was my first time ordering this product (to help with the absorption of iron), and had I known that there was a warning for people who've had kidney stones, I wouldn't have ordered it. Kind of a hassle to return it and not sure they would take it, since I opened it."
3,Looks nice but...,"Looks nice on my wall but its not a collectible item, all have the same picture and the same film cell, but for the price can not ask for more right?"
3,Interesting but disjointed,"Being French, I was intrigued by some comments I read on this book and compliments on the author. Delbanco was even compared to Peter Mayle, however, I have to disagree. Although Delbanco's stories are sometimes amusing, the text does not flow as well as Mayle's. I find Delbanco's story telling very disjointed and the style too spoken-like. The concept is valid, the facts are interesting, but I do not find this a compelling read."
4,No bubbles or shrinking sides,"I had never used these before. I have tried beans and foil, but it was not worth the beans! I was pleasantly surprised when my crust stayed in shape and lightly browned like I wanted it. Wish I had bought them years ago. I did order a second package because I usually make pies two at a time."
2,"Product works, shipping was a total miss on the sellers part","The glass mason jar they were shipped in showed up completely shattered, due to the lack of protection inside the oversized box.I was giving as a Christmas stocking stuffier, and was short on time, or I might have tried to return the item. But, instead I bought a new container, and obsessively cleaned each weight of shattered glass (probably not a welcome ingredient in a pie crust!).My brother (the recipient) has use them a couple times since, and says they work well though."
1,Do not order product in the jar!,"As a gift for my sister, I ordered the 9.5 ounce jar of ceramic pie weights. My sister called to thank me for my thoughtfulness but had to tell me that one jar was shattered and the other cracked!"
2,Ordinary Mystery/Detective Book,"Speak Of The Dead is the second in the Gabe Wager mystery series and the first in which he is a homicide cop. Wager is the standard good cop who breaks cases due to his work ethic and insight without taking the easy way out.In this book, Wager is investigating a murder mystery where the corpseless head (as opposed to headless corpse) is found in the Denver botanical gardens.Dated somewhat in terms of crome sophistication, being written in 1979, it doesn't ride about the level of an ordinary detective book. No real twists and turns in the plot. Its not a *bad* book, but there isn't anything to particularly recommend it. I would give it 2&1/2 stars if I had that option, but can't bring myself to round up to 3."
1,I hate it,It didn't fit my vehicle as described. Complete waste of money. It was advertised to fit dodge dakota pick up and its not even close.
1,Did Not fit,"I ordered for a 2001 Dodge Ram 1500 series truck's driver side mirror, had to return because product did not fit!"
1,not for sport models at least,"This mirror glass does NOT fit a 1997 Dakota Sportthe ""Does it fit"" application at the top will not ask you if your truck is a sport - If your truck has the square chrome mirrors from the older (pre-97) body style - they should fit. At least thats the only truck i can think of that has mirrors in a rounded square like that.Just a heads up since there is no pitcure - returned mine."
5,Best game ever,Let me start by saying that this game is totally sweet it has like ps3 graphics and sound great story line I recommend this to anyone who wants a challenging but beetable game for ther psp
1,How do you aim???,"This game had high expectashins as a call of duty franchized item... it should have stayed ps2/pc... you aim with the X -tringle- O -sqair- buttens, and the aim assist is beyond reduclis on its extream movments and somtimes you end up with your back to the enamy because it whips you around chasing one guy... the movment is difcult with the aiming the way it is, yet the game over all finished way to fast. Not worth the price not worth the time played"
5,I WANT THE GAME,THIS game sounds extremeley fun and all i know is im going to own one!!!!!!! But im not sure if the graphics are good and if its to easy to beat:( . So if you read this and you think its good please awnser my question!!!!!!!!!!
3,A Gift,This was purchased as a gift so I have no actual knowledge of the DVD. It did arrive on time.
1,Lasted less than 5 minutes,"My dog chewed this whole thing down in less than 5 minutes! I was expecting it to last longer. He is on the bigger end of the weight chart for this size bone (regular), at 40lbs...but I think it should have lasted longer."
3,No odor control for me either,I ordered this 3 months ago and same problem no odor control which is why we wanted it in the first place.
3,Intro to the Clans,"This novel, and those of the Legend of the Jade Phoenix Trilogy, are important in the Battletech series simply because they're in universe and character looks at the quite different Clan society. It provided the first shot at seeing that, and remains quite important. Also, as a heads up, they are not written in the Clancyesqe technothriller style that come prevalent in later novels, but they give very much an science fiction epic feel that makes them very unique."
5,Super humor from MIT!,"""Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT"" is a well-written documentation of the ingenious stunts engineered by the super bright, super creative students at MIT. The author doesn't lose any of the hilarity in his/her description of the student hijinks."
4,"Helpful, but Seligman's other books may be more helpful","This book reads like an encyclopedia, with solid information regarding numerous topics such as anxiety, phobias, obsession, as well as sex, dieting and alcohol. A better starting point for many people might be his books, ""Learned Optimism"" and ""Authentic Happiness"". Learned Optimism summarizes many experiments and studies, and provides the sound theoretical basis for Positive Psychology. This provides the credibility you may wish before you proceed further. Authentic Happiness builds on that theory."
4,"outstanding, thorough, realistic","This is an excellent guide to self-help, by a highly qualified author. Seligman reviews everything from dieting to drinking to sexual dysfunction, pointing out the best ways to get help.Very readable"
5,A book to further human understanding,"If you are at all confused about life, the universe and everything else associated with it then this is The book.This book takes your mind on a journey from God and the origin of the Earth, with geological facts, to the most modern of all technological advances through the sciences.The author offers challanges for many inquistiive minds to join a journey in support of the what I read to be a significant Biblical foundation of our world.This new model for the origin of species proposed in this book is definately as founded as any other model so far given to us. So who knows where this revelation may lead?Thank goodness there is a plain English book to shed light on such a difficult area!"
1,Does NOT work!,"I just received these a week ago and I've been eating them ever since. I thought this was suppose to help curb my appetite, but it doesn't! I don't know if it's just me, but once I'm done eating a lollipop I'm hungry for food. I figured maybe it was just the first time, but every other time I ate a lollipop, I would get extremely hungry right after. I will admit it tastes good but it doesn't do what it's claiming. I haven't lost any weight, at all."
3,Seems to work but too much acid?,"I liked these lollipos. They seemed to work and tasted pretty good. The drawback was that they contained sugar (bad for a ketogenic diet) and they burned the inside of my mouth (I'm guessing they have a lot of acid in them). Because I'm afraid they may damage my teeth due to what I'm guessing is a high acid content, I probably will not order them again which is a shame. They really seemed to help curb my appetite. :("
4,Well structured book,"This book has a good content structure for anyone who want to study biomedical applications of physics. For biophysics and first year medical students, this book used in conjunction with a standard calculus or algebra physics book, will be a big help on a better understanding and application of Physics."
3,ok,"Ease of use is low. It arrived with the knob loose so I simply tightened it with a allen wrench. Serves it's purpose.I wonder what copper stand cables are??UPDATE: After a few years, it started making a rattling noise inside. I opened it up, and found 4 loose nuts, one fell off and was the rattler. The cheezy box protects it well, but is falling apart.After using it several times, I finally memorized the instructions. It always does a very good job of telling me the battery's condition. Hook it up, load to half the cca, 15 seconds to test, fairly simple. Just make sure the load knob is all the way off when attaching and detaching or it will spark like mad.I tried to change from 3 to 4 stars, but it won't let me."
3,"OK, but not a precise instrument","For the cheap price, it may be good to do the odd battery load test, but adjustment was finicky and it started sparking inside sometimes."
3,Definately Average,"The pro's of this tester are the ability to adjust amperage load. Accurate testing of a wide range of CCA are possible with this tester.The cons: The tester performs it's functions; however, it seems cheaply built. I haven't had it long, but the ""carbon piles"" seem very fragile and destined to break. I run a mobile mechanic service, and I was afraid to put it in my truck. I move it around real softly afraid I'm going to break it. The adjustment knob seems really cheaply made also. It doesn't seem to adjust real accurately either. After you stop turning the knob, the needle will continue to rise sometimes.All in all, it seems to be a very capable tester although cheaply manufactured."
4,"Cooooool, baby, real cool","Yeah, this is a modern jazz recording, but it is a laid-back, sophisticated, mellow modern jazz recording. And none of the pieces gets more mellow than track four, ""Afterthought."" This is one of those, turn-the-lights-down, take-the-phone-off-the-hook recordings that needs to be listened to as dusk is slowing morphing into nighttime. And the sound? It's great -- you've not heard jazz (or any music, for that matter) until you've heard it on an SACD recording. Telarc's very fine multichannel SACD recording is the absolute best. Very highly recommended."
4,a fine set,"mr. camilo is a wonderful latin jazz pianist, but with a different approach than say chu valdes. whereas mr. valdes literally burns up the keyboard, mr. camilo, on this album, takes a lighter approach avoiding the sameness of bossa nova, but with a gentler swing than mr. valdes' eruptions. the nood is more like a warm evening looking over the gulf--the rhythm is there, but it swings like the waves coming in. the orginal tunes shine, but for me the highlights were dizzy gillespie's ""con alma"" and the haunting, almost nothingness of ""just like you."" the delicacy leaves leaning toward the speakers to catch every whispered note. enjoy!"
5,Good quality and wonderful service,"Nothing but wonderful the quality and the service provided. The radiator is in good condition and works properly. In fact, i bought an used radiator, for me it's a brand new one. No difference between a new radiator and the one i purchased. Congrats!!!!"
5,Grimbolds otherworld,This book is great for children adults! when you read this book it will transport you into a world of magic.
2,meh,"Not what I expected. Thought it would be soft leather but feels like spray painted plastic. The price was great, would not recommend this item though."
1,So very long and wordy,"We selected this book for our December book club discussion. I am only on page 388, and at this point it has become just a chore to pick it up and make my way through it. All about Una all the time, in way way way too many words. For more detail on my one star rating, let me refer you to the review titled: Everyone Loves Una; Or, The Navel-Gazer: A Mary Sue. I couldn't agree more or say it better."
4,Liked this? Now you must read another (see below.),"I'll sound like a parrot here - repeating what's been said in other reviews. This book was near perfect in the first half, and then starts drowning in its own melodrama. Good god, how many people can die in 300 pages?! This book needed serious editing in the second half. Still, VERY beautifully written.However, here's the new part I want to add: If you enjoyed the subject matter, now turn to ""The Heart of the Sea"" - it's the true story of the sinking of the whaleship Essex, and it must be from the Essex that Naslund borrowed her Sussex (the ship Una went on.) It gives a marvelous (though gruesome) depiction of that event, and dovetails nicely with ""Ahab's Wife"", confirming Naslund's details. Next, I'm on to Moby Dick to complete the trilogy..."
5,Enthralling,I haven't been this captivated by a story since reading Thomas Hardy in high school. Una Spenser is a true heroine and this parallel telling of the mighty tale of the great white whale is destined to become a companion classic next to Melville's. The writing is both real and dreamlike as the story weaves it's spell. The almost 700 pages turn easily and you feel as if this must be a true telling of history. It is a literary masterpiece and I am so much richer for having read it!
1,Ahab's Wife,"I am not sure why I so differ from so many of your other reviewers! I would not even have given it one star, had that been an option. It is tedious, WAY too long, and in my judgment an insult to Melville's giant book and characters. To me, it appeared to be the author's opportunity to celebrate her own brilliance: so much irrelevant information; so little character development; in fact, so little character. Unfortunately, Naslund chose to abandon the few interesting characters she did manage to develop and left their lives or deaths to the reader to resolve. There are so many wonderful books written about the period in which Una lived, I feel cheated for having stuggled through this trite and far too long novel."
2,what a disappointment,"My God. After 300 pages, I realized that not one good thing had happened to anyone in the book. Suicide, cannibalism, miscarriages, madness, just to name a few. The author has a whimsically intense way of writing; at times she manages to capture a quaint voice of yesteryear. But the main character is not convincing and her motivation for her aberrant acts is fuzzy. I finally gave up. The book certainly did a fine job of convincing one not to go whaling- but continuing on would have just been an exercise in endurance."
5,The Lady Can Write!,"This is probably the most well-written book I've ever read. The story itself is compelling, but the language and style of the writing is what impressed me the most. Naslund delves so deeply into the psyche of her main character that I don't know how anyone can fail to see a part of him/herself in Una. This book will appeal to the contemplative, a quick read it is not. Take time and savor this one..."
3,"great idea, mixed execution","I love the idea of rewriting Melville's _Moby-Dick_ from a woman's perspective, the more so as Melville, though the greatest American novelist ever, was writing almost entirely about a world of men. I liked Sena Naslund's book less than its underlying idea, however (and so did most of the 9 students I read it with); sharply intelligent in places, imaginative, but also sentimental, unnecessarily and willfully complicated, over-broad in reach, and at points ludicrous."
3,Way too long,"Interesting, but far, far too long. It would have been greatly improved if it was cut by 1/3. I was put off sometimes by the ""old english"" that was spoken by the charactersJack Bryan"
4,"Beautiful and Spiritual, A Real Journey","Basically, there is no reason to not like this book.Una, the main character is literally every woman. She's who you are, who you're afraid of being, and who you'd like to be someday. The reader goes through so much with Una; the death of a baby, leaving home after a personal disaster, and making a family of unique and likable friends.The writer is so eloquent, and the words she strings together are jarringly beautiful. She is writing a classic into the modern age.Moreover, her Una, Ahab, Margaret Fuller, and Frederick Douglass are interesting and attainable. They go through the full range of human emotions. They break and make conventions. It's this- the struggle of when and where or ever to conform that make this book a true piece of art."
4,A great read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found the time in my hectic schedule to plow through it. As with SP Somtow's ""The Shattered Horse"", I find it intriguing that such an elaborte, well-designed and interesting story can be based only on a single line of prose from another literary work."
2,Mrs. A and the time machine,"I am surprised by the unflagging praise for this book. Although the language and description is well-crafted, I found the character of Una, and references from her point of view, jarringly twentieth-century. I refer not to her spirit, adventurousness, and desire to follow a different drummer, but to her ""modern"" political correctness in all things, admiration of the ""athletic"" (did they have aerobics during whaling days?), and lack of an 1800's viewpoint in any discernable way."
5,Joyous celebration of mysterious life,"This novel will make you feel as though every cell in your body is crying out at the wonder and ecstasy and painful beauty that is earthly life. It seems as though it was not written, but spoken by an aged woman by a roaring fire, telling every detail of her young life. This is possibly my favorite book of all, although it is in competition withThe Red Tent: A Novelby Anita Diamant. Don't be deterred if you haven't read Moby Dick, you don't need to know anything about it. This story is completely sovereign. Anyone interested in complete absorption with their literature, step right up."
1,Avoid.,"Overly long. I found the crux of the story to be poorly built up, and given more meaning than it deserved. On the whole, the problem felt forced and overly ""symbolic.""There were a few moments when the book clicked, but they were few and far between."
2,"So, so","Naslund was trying too hard. Good story at first, but I quickly became bored. Can't copy classic style; she should have just been herself. Too bad."
3,"Ahab's Wife: Or, The Star-gazer: A Novel",I found the book to move very slowly. The author was very descriptive. I did not finish the book. I would not recommend it but maybe if I had finished it I would feel differently.
5,Great book sent quickly.,Gift for my Sister on her 50th. My wife read it this summer and thought my sister would like it too.
5,"HORROR, MADNESS AND SURVIVAL","This carefully researched historical novel is a back story to Ahab, the obsessed whaling captain of ""Moby Dick"" by Herman Melville. The woman he marries is portrayed as the synthesis of what a woman in 19th century New England had to be in order to survive--tough, intuitive, persistent, loving and forgiving. Impulsive as a teenager, Una disguised herself as a cabin boy in order to sail out of Nantucket to experience life on a whaling ship, to ride the oceans from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but she had no idea of the horror to come. After the ship is overturned by a whale in the South Seas, she is adrift with half a dozen shipmates, and the experience escalates into one of the darkest places the human mind and heart can go. Two of the mates are old friends and competing for her love, but that dissolves in the aftermath--one commits suicide and the other descends into madness. And this is just the beginning."
5,Modern Fiction that Reads Like a Classic,"I have so much trouble finding fiction that is engaging yet meaty. I loved this book so much I was sorry that it ended! Una is a fantastic character - strong, yet very human. All the characters are wonderfully unique and multi-dimensional. I enjoyed the historical figures and references tied in."
3,Ahab's fictional wife's philosphical musings and deep inner life,"Ahab's Fictional Wife's Philosphical Musings and Deep Inner Life is a title that aptly describes this endless novel. The segments that were plot-driven, such as Una's adventures as a sailor and the mental illness of her first husband, were wonderful. Ahab, until now merely an icon, was infused with genuine humanity, and the story of their marriage was so well done. Life on Nantucket and the experience of sea captains' wives are vividly drawn. Naslund is a very good writer. It was all the stuff in between (Una's odes to her sewing needle, her effusive love affair with the seas, her genius despite her poor education, to offer just a few out of dozens of examples) that brings my rating down to 3 stars. Maybe this new writer was given a new editor. Someone should have blue pencilled about 200 pages of filler. Certainly Abundance is a much tauter production. This book might have been equally good."
2,A Wasted Weekend,"Una made me tired. Everything bad that could happen, did. She continued to revel in her own strength, her own life, her own freedom, blah, blah, blah...I was fascinated by the seafaring stories and the character of Ahab. Seems that I should have read Moby Dick instead. I guess that's why that call Mellville a classic and this one a recent ""best-seller."" That tell us that we are all wasting weekends.The Christian-bashing in this book (in the name of tolerance, of course) was like fingernails on a chalkboard - just rubbed me the wrong way. Una just doesn't ""get it."" Transcendentalism, Universalism, etc all get their equal kudos, but she is absolutely closed-minded where Christianity is concerned.Two stars is a generous rating. Maybe I should reconsider. Should I order the hardcover or paperback edition of Moby Dick?"
3,A novel of epic proportion but does it hold your attention?,"Another question comes to mind, how long is long? This novel was very long and at points quite tedious. I stuck with it for two-thirds of the way and then had to come up for air. Perhaps I'm not the best person to review it, but to those who follow my reviews I feel compelled to let you know what I think.The story is one of interest but I found that the author took too long to tell it. I personally come from the area of Massachusetts that is mentioned in the book and I have to admit I enjoyed much of the imformation imparted. I grew up near a historical whaling town and was amazed at what I learned from this book but it wasn't enough to keep me hanging on. Perhaps I'll try her next book. Kelsana 4/04/01"
4,"Wow, what a woman!","I had never read Moby Dick, but after reading Ahab's Wife, I am personally ready to take on the great white whale myself! The heroin in the story is strong, courageous, bold, and has enough faults to make her believable. I wished I could travel with her."
2,Seduced and disappointed,"I was seduced into reading this book by the many positive reviews, and by a yearning to relive my joy of reading Moby Dick many years ago in high school. For the past two weeks I've gone from savoring the language and intriguing story of Ahab's Wife to skimming through the final 150 pages, impatient for it to be finally over. Ms. Naslund's blatant feminist agenda is rivaled only by that of Jean Auel, who attributed everything but the invention of the Internet to her Cromagnon heroine, Ayla. Una and her entourage are ultimately implausible as characters, standing more as icons for Ms. Naslund's beliefs. Ahab is the most human character of all, and I'll soon revisit him in his original incarnation."
4,"Moby Dick, who/what? ...","I enjoyed this novel. At times, I found certain scenes/chapters to be a bit tedious; however, for the most part, it was quite enjoyable. Ms. Naslund was able to create a memorable character and story that can stand on their own. Moby Dick, what is that? Well, there did need to be the slightest mention of a wife in the original classic in order for this novel to be believable. The idea was original and the plot held true to the events of Moby Dick. I found it satisfying to hear about the events from a woman's perspective. Any lengthy discription of whaling would have put me to sleep instantly. This is a beautifully written novel and would be perfect for a book club discussion. I recommend this book for those who like historical fiction (whether or not they have read Moby Dick)."
2,A Literary Soap Opera,"While this book is a compelling and well written read, it should be produced as a ABC movie of the week or on daytime TV. This book is melodrama in pure form. The author also gives the protagonist 20th-century thoughts in a 19th-century world. Una is not written for her time, but for our time. The author name drops famous people into the story, which serves the author's research well but tended to annoy me. It is highly unlikely she would meet Nathanial Hawthorne Margaret Mead or Maria Mitchell. But the worst fault of the books is that Una never has any flaws and unfortunately never develops as a character. I found myself wanting to finish the book but unsatisfied when I finished. There are better books to spend 600+ pages on."
3,Over the top,"There are many charming stories tucked away in this very long book, but after awhile it becomes unbelieveable (even for fiction) that any character would be so calm in the face of adversity, unflinching at danger and so able to move on from one devastation after another. The writing is easily read, and draws the reader in, but the over-sappy, over-optimistic, over-done content has started to make my eyes roll... and I still have 150 pages to go! But, three stars for keeping me plodding through instead of taking it, unfinished, to the second-hand store."
3,"Literal, not literary","For two-thirds of its length, through the heroine's marriage to Captain Ahab, the book is a crisp, well-thought page-turner, although it merely skims the philosophical depths one would expect of a feminine revision of Melville. The last third, however--from the use of fiction's most famous opening line in casual conversation, to the conclusion that reads more like a romance novel than real literature--removes all the scope and grandeur. Finally, truly, this *is* a romance novel, and not in the classical sense--it's in the true, modern scope of basing the narrative around the heroine's love life, and finally bringing that--and only that--to a satisfactory conclusion."
2,2 stars instead of 1 for at least a good start,"AHAB'S WIFE begins beautifully. A young girl, Una, is sent to live with her relatives in a light house because she refuses to adhere to her father's religious beliefs. She soon disguises herself as a boy to go aboard a whaling ship. The beginning sets the stage for what could be a very deep book. I was disappointed that it turned out to be a book about Una's progression of husbands. She falls in love with a man who drowns, thus she marries his best friend. Her husband goes crazy and disappears. She then marries a kindred spirit, Ahab, who leaves her in a beautiful house for years while he searches Moby Dick (who was responsible for him losing his leg). After she learns that Ahab is killed by Moby Dick, she meets and cohabitates with her new neighbor. In retrospect, the story seems to be more about the progression of men in her life than anything else. The deepness that seemed possible at the beginning of the book is never realized."
3,"""A promise made is a debt unpaid""","As with the ocean and the starry sky, ""Ahab's Wife"" displays both brilliance and doldrums. Curiously, I found Una's marriage with Ahab among the least credible and most tediously written segments, no better than the average romance; her life before Ahab was much better written. And ""Ahab's Wife"" is not the feminist version of ""Moby-Dick""; it's a spinoff. Melville's long, informative passages and his humorous passages are missing here. ""Ahab's Wife"" is an entertaining read with beautiful and poetic passages, but the promise is inconsistently fulfilled leaving me, in the end, disappointed. Most fulfilling: Kentucky and the lighthouse. Most disappointing: a 12-year-old Quaker girl ""lifting her skirts"" for a dwarf's silver coin (!) and Ishmael as husband; good grief!"
3,"Ahab's Wife ,a Difficult Journey","The descriptions in this book are rich and are lovely to read. The adventures of the heroine are diverse, unusual,but push the boundaries of beliveability. Filled with exciting adventures. The novel would provide a rich source for a discussion of situational ethics. Worth reading, not great."
2,Very long,"I started reading this book without any expectations. I found the story to be too long. Some of the story lines were very interesting, while others made the plot drag on to no real point.The main character, at one point, disguises herself as a boy, and ladns a cabin boy position on a whaling ship. I know that women have done this in the past, and some were even pirates while disguised, but I just had a difficult time believing this tale."
2,Not so much.,"Not so much! Even the title was overdone. One or the other would have been fine.Way too much writing for what the book seemed to be trying to say. Too much descriptive effort and way too much jumping around.Sounded as if the book was trying too hard to resemble some older style of writing and just didn't make the grade.Much dedication, though, must have been put into this book from the length of it, but it was such an effort to finish reading.Sorry. Perhaps it is one of those novels that a reader has to be in a certain mood to read. There are many good books around that are that way."
3,Ahab's Wife,"There is accurate and interesting information in this book. Parts are intriguing, but a good editor would have been as asset."
4,Worth the Effort,"This is a great big sprawling work but it hangs together surprisingly well. Somewhat ""attached"" to Moby Dick it doesn't require you to remember any details of that book. The characters are unusual but believable. The descriptions of 19th C life and especially life on Nantucket were fascinating. Una is a great heroine and the writing is lovely. Highly recommended."
1,"I too, wanted to like this book","I was never a fan of Moby Dick but, having been an English major, I am very familiar with it. When I began reading the book, I was pretty excited to have found an interesting take on the original story. B ut then, the plot deviated, and deviated, and deviated. There are just too many plot twists and she ""accidentally"" meets just too many famous 19th century ""luminaries."" I must say the most contrived one situation was when she ""happened"" to me Hawthorne in the woods surrounding Walden Pond--and he was wearinga black veil no less! Naslund has him leaving a meeting of noted Transcendentalist thinkers...too bad Hawthorne was Anti-transcendentalist! I finished the bookhoping that Naslund might salvage it but, once again she went too far. Una and Ishmael, the man named afterthe Biblical liar? I am beginning to think Naslund needs to change her nom de plume to Ishmael. It'd make her book easier to swallow."
2,Too Long/Boring,Cut out the wasted prose and endless descriptions and the book would be reduced by half - and the better for it. I had to force myself to finish this book.
4,Couldn't put this book down!,"I really enjoyed the characters and story in this book. I also thought the writing style was for the most part excellent and filled with memorable passages. I agree with some of the criticisms about it being a bit preachy in parts, but the main focus of the story was so enjoyable that it more then compensated any shortcomings. I would highly recommend this book even if you are not particularly interested in the ocean or whaling."
2,A Sad Waste of Reading Time,"The title for my review says it all. I forced myself to finish this, reading long after it became a chore, just because I hoped it would get better. No such luck. The writing was just fair, becoming very disappointing after a good start, with recurrent episodes of shallow philosophical wandering contributing nothing. Plot unbelievable and immature in it's grandiosity. No message for anyone living in reality. Skip it!"
5,A perfect novel,"I have just recommended this book to Oprah's show, and I am hoping it will get the coverage it richly deserves.I believe the previous reviewer is a man, as it takes a woman's mind, heart, and soul to appreciate the depth and and true spirit of this book.For someone like me to comment on the author's writing skills would be an insult, as she is clearly one of the finest contemporary writers in America, and I am nothing more than an avid reader.Words should be read and reread not because they are pretentious or ""preachy,"" but rather for the feelings they evoke if they are understood. I understood this book...as clear as a bell. I will read it again someday, soon, just so I can have the same feeling, that glorious feeling, that there is still literary life in the universe. READ THIS BOOK. And then write and thank me."
3,Ahab's wife was from the 20th century?,"The prose was lovely; much of the story engrossing, but ultimately it was difficult to believe in Una as a woman of the mid-19th century. It's not very credible that she could reject or ignore the Christian belief and morality and prejudice that surrounded her. And for her to fortuitously have invested in petroleum and to have neatly met up and paired off with Ishmael to round off the story...Sorry, my belief is not that easily suspended."
1,Very Slow Reading,I found this book very slow reading. I could only read half of it. Perhaps if a movie is made then maybe I would see it.
5,ahab's wife,I haven't read the book yet but I am looking forward to reading it. Everything went well with my purchase. Thank you.
3,A Fat Page Turner,"There are not enough 500+ novels out there, so I am grateful for this 700-page story. The book is without a doubt a page-turner, but only three stars because the author has an unforgivably bad habit of name-dropping (Forest Gump is a fool to this woman!), but it really does not serve a purpose in the story (unlike with Forest Gump), it just seems a bit silly. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading this book."
3,Slightly Dreary,"I truly looked foreward to reading this book and after giving it a really good chance, found it to be lengthy and at times, I didn't know what the characters were talking about. Trying to decifer the conversations became trying and it was only when 3/4 of the way through that I became interested in the plot. Although Una was indeed Ahab's wife, it was for a very short portion of the book. I realize that background was needed to introduce the character but this was a little rediculous. It should have had a different title."
2,Trying to be more than fan fiction,"This book was way too long for it's own good. The main character didn't change from page 1 to page 666. As another reviewer put it, it was like Forrest Gump in the mid-1800s, but without the humor."
1,"Help! I'm reading ""Ahab's Wife"" and I can't ....","seem to finish it! I couldn't figure out what was wrong with this book until I decided to check out some of the one * reviews. I have just slogged up to the part when she marries ""Crazy Kit"" and from what everyone else says it gets worse??? I am not one to put down a book unfinished but I fear this will be one of them (the other one was Toni Morrison's ""Beloved""....one of the pretentious selections from ""Oprah's Book Club"") I can't justify wasting my time on this book!"
2,What am I missing?,"I loved the first sentence, but after that it went quickly downhill. I felt that the story was rather juvenile,and written in a stilted, hard to get into, style. Couldn't make it past page 200..... Disappointing!"
4,A Slow Journey Superbly Told,"Una Spenser narrates her life from a childhood in Kentucky to an upbringing in Nantucket to life aboard a whaling ship and all of her marriages in-between. But ""Ahab's Wife"" is less of tale of events and more a tale of a young woman's spiritual journey. So readers should not expect a twist-turning plot or cliff-hanging suspense. Rather the reader should expect a creative tale richly told.I would have given ""Ahab's Wife"" 5-stars but I thought author Sena Jeter Naslund's prose was a little heavy-handed. I just feel that written prose should be like perfume where a little is intriguing but a lot becomes overpowering. I thought Ms Naslund's prose-rich writing made for a rather slow read. Enjoyable but slow. If you have the time ""Ahab's Wife"" would make a rewarding effort."
3,"nice, but overwritten . ..","If only the entire book could have been as captivating as the opening chapter. The author is a good writer in need of a good & honest editor. There were parts that were brilliant and parts that were just padding. And this is a good example of what computer editing/spell checking can mean -- the book is littered with faux pas like using the word ""receipt"" twice when the author meant ""recipe."" Good writers won't let those things slip, and good editors (not computers) can catch them when they do."
2,Maybe it's because I'm an Eskimo...,"It's only protein! Get over yourselves! That was the most interesting section of the book, when Una goes on board a whaling ship, and they are sunk by a BLACK whale (Una works in the Crow's Nest and actually sees Moby Dick before she even meets Ahab). Silliness.I will say it has one of the best first lines ever: Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last. Good line. Too bad the rest wasn't as engaging! Too many characters with too little characterization. And what's with that eagle at the lighthouse? I didn't believe that scene at all, and I should have stopped right there. It's a feminist treatise with some nice writing in between. The end made me want to gag.All in all it made me want to read ""Moby Dick"". Nice illustrations. Give it fifty pages and see what you think. Some people in our book club loved it! Go figure."
2,overrated,"This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to ""Life of Pi"" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary."
3,"Moby, where were you?","We read this for our book club this month after doing the backgound of seeing the old movie, Moby Dick. I kept looking for Moby Dick and hoping he would end it all a lot sooner than 700 pages. Una's story was too involved to hold my interest for long periods of time. I would have enjoyed reading it as several shorter novels that didn't have me going here and there, back and forth. For those of you who are committed to whaling and interwining stories, this is an author whose novel you might enjoy."
5,"Absorbing, thought-provoking and exciting all at once","What a pleasure it was to read this wonderful story of a young woman, Una Spenser, whose strong spirit guides her through life, extracting all the wonders to be found. Through Una, we meet many unforgettable characters, such as Susan, the runaway slave, David, the resourceful ""little person"", and, of course, the powerful Captain Ahab himself. Reading this book has been one of my life's treasured experiences!"
5,Retreat Hell,"W.E.B Griffen is a miracle of consistency in all his military based novels. It is hard to call them novels when they are so faithful to historical events and the personalities of the historical characters. Like Mc Donald's Travis Magee series, you can reread them every few years with relish. I have read the ""Corp"" series at least three times. I also love the feedback I have gotten from friends I've introduced to W.E.B. Griffen."
1,"Brother, Was This One Thrown Together","Over the years, Griffin's Marine Corps books, which had been an very entertaining diversion, have become more and more slapdash. Poor character and plot development, silly dialog (especially the 5% that come from the mouths of females), mistakes, errors, and oversights.This one needs to be recalled by the publisher. At a minimum it requires more thought and better editing - from a grammatical and cultural standpoint. (Hey Mr/Ms Editor!! Learn the proper use of commas, semicolons, and, above all, apostrophes - they are NOT there for decoration!)But, we dumb bunnies continue to buy Griffin's books, so why should he care what he's writing? Until the demand dries up, he'll continue to laugh all the way to the bank."
5,Retreat Hell,Since this was the completion of The Corps books. It was a bit like saying goodbye to a very good friend.You come to know these individuals and like most of them. I so enjoy the author and will begin a new series shortly.
3,"Retreat, Hell! We're just attacking in a different direction!","I like the WEB Griffin books and particularly the early(Corps)novels. This effort is not as good as the early books but it is passable. It appears that Griffin was losing interest in the (Corps) books, since he hasn't published another one. I'm sorry about that because I'd like his take on the Marines' involvement in the Viet Nam War. Sadly, I don't think that will happen as, ""He has moved in a different direction..."""
2,I Surrendered!,"Having struggled through about half of Retreat, Hell, I surrendered to the boring plot, weak character development and lack of action and gave up reading it. The jacket cover made me feel that I was going to be in for a real treat. However, I was misled and can sum my feelings up about this book in one acronym...NATO... no action, talk only. Rather than providing a good mix of action and military history, Retreat, Hell is so filled with minutiae that it overwhelms any of the very few and far between parts that are (at best) moderately exciting. Do yourself a favor and sjip this book."
3,Not Really What I Expected - Came Up Short,"This book is more about interpersonal relationships between officers, politicians and their significant others. The book is also about which officer hates which other officer for mostly unexplained reasons and who trusts someone else because they served in War Two (or One) together; and how to misappropriate the best material for your unit. The author treats everyone with respect by giving their full military titles over and over (probably could have saved 10 pages by cutting these back to Maj. McCoy or the like) except for Capt. Al Haig - who deserved similar respect since he was a four-star general and U.S. Secretary of State later in his career. One of the characters has the nickname ""Killer"" which is never explained except that he hates to be called that name."
3,Unrealistic,"Griffin seems to be getting worse regarding the language used by the women in his books. I'm aware that men use this offensive language at times (maybe frequently) but have been spared its use by females, gratefully. In my experience, it's not realistic."
3,"Good, but not Griffin at his best","Griffin's latest entry in his WWII/Korean War series is a good read, but it's by no means his best book in that series. The earlier books, the USMC war novels, are better. The later books have an OSS/CIA slant, which Griffin doesn't handle as well.From the title, one would expect a sweeping war novel, but it's really about field intelligence operations in the early days of the CIA. McCoy is back in action, behind the lines, and as competent as ever. Pick Pickering gets himself into trouble, and this time it's serious. Really, though, by now all the major characters are too senior to be doing what they're doing.A previous book in this series, ""Behind the Lines"" is being made into a movie, ""They Fought Alone"", starring Brad Pitt. ""Behind the Lines"" is a better book than ""Retreat, Hell"". Read it first if you haven't read Griffin before."
1,W.E.B. Griffin is slipping,"I read the first 7 or 8 of Griffin's books on the Corps, but this one leaves me flat. Griffin's goes into great detail on his characters but there is no real plot. In many parts of the book there is page after page of meaningless descriptions and dialogue. I get the feeling that Mr. Griffin is only filling pages. After skipping some of his later books, I wanted to try him again. ""Retreat Hell!"" just doesn't do it for me."
2,WHat Picture?,"Why would any supposed writer/historian have, as his cover jacket picture, a Marine PFC, from 1st MarDiv, sprinting across ""Death Valley"" in Okinawa, in the Spring of 1945?Wrong war........wrong location."
3,Review of W.E.B. Griffin-Retreat Hell,"I have read all of his previous publications. I enjoyed all of them. However, this one was lacking something. His caliber of writing seems to be lacking. The quality of this book, in relation to his others, is ordinary."
2,The Master is Back!,"While I was sadly disappointed with his ""Under Fire"", especially because of the miserable, maybe not even existent, editing...well, that is past. Old friend WEB is back in harness and in fine fettle, indeed.There are a couple of warts, but aren't they in any book? Jeanette Priestley of the Chicago Trib, is a brunette in ""Under Fire"", and a sexy blonde in the new book. So what! Even my wife is sometimes known to use the industrial version.This book is truly a return to the old masterhood in military story telling. Buy the book, it is worth to be in your personal library.PS: Is that a Cuban cigar he is smoking in the picture of the book jacket? UUUUUUUH! Dat's a nono!Tsk, tsk, tsk!"
3,"Good, but lacking...","An example would be their glossing over dual balanced photodetection and RIN cancellation. RIN is often THE dominant noise source in an otherwise well designed coherent communication system. They off-handedly refer to an inadequate and far from original paper on the subject. I did however appreciate their treatment of phase noise, and their efforts to at least cover the various modulation formats....even if the answers are 3dB lower SNR than they could be..."
5,classic,I had a subscription to ralph snart comics in the late 80s. I'm quite happy they got rereleased in this book form. It's just as good as it always was.
3,Cross Creek Review,"Cross Creek is a wonderful vignette look into early 20th Century life in ""Old Florida"". The book is different in style from Rawlings well known work, The Yearling. The Yearling tells a tender story of a boy coming of age during the depression era in Florida; Cross Creek is a sketch of the characters that live in this little wetland community of Florida."
5,An older autobiography with a twist,"For any who don't know, Rawlings gained her initial notoriety for the book, The Yearling. Cross Creek is an autobiography of her years spent on 75 acres just below Gainesville which became her retreat for a number of years. This was in the 1940s when much of Florida was still rural. My wife and I own a mobile home in rural Lake City, Florida, but it is not nearly as secluded as Rawling's place. She presents a wonderfully vivid picture of untamed Florida during this period. Surprisingly, the book is not a self-indulgent reflection on her books and how well they sold. She concentrates more upon her natural surroundings and the individuals around her, both friend and foe. If I recommended a memoir by a writer living in rural Florida, you would probably not run out and buy the book. But Rawling's honest transparency and unabashed candor make this a book worth reading."
5,Unexplainably Profound,"I have difficulty putting my love for this book into words. I feel a kinship with Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings that defies reason. After reading this book, I had to buy every book I could find about the author, and then I went to Florida to see her house and farm at Cross Creek. I have read the book aloud to other people twice and have given copies of it to friends. It may not move others in the same way as it does me, but it is a lovely depiction of life in rural Florida in the 1930s."
5,She Always Makes Me Cry,"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings always makes me cry. The other reviews of this book here describe it so eloquently and throughly that I don't feel the need to add to that aspect. The book has a strong emotional pull that made me cry and made long to go to Cross Creek and see it for myself. Rawlings is one of my all-time favorite writers, ever since my seventh-grade teacher read the newly published book The Yearling to her class, a chapter or two each day after lunch."
1,Some good info...but,"The pictures are great and it contains little bubbles of information which is informative. Eye catching. However, I have to give it one star as the environmental tone it contains really is a turn off. It would be a great book without its jabs. While some of the information has truth to it, it seems they're using blanket statements leading readers to assume ""all"". I don't care for books that lead young children to think one way by using lack of information. Not only so, it doesn't need to be in this book, but perhaps in a political science type book where students can actually analyze and discuss these issues.This book was bought with a Christian curriculum, so I was taken back by its environmental tone. If that doesn't bother you, or if it's read along with a parent who can discuss some of these issues, it's a great book."
3,Youth coaches bible,"Although this book is good for a ""D"" license, and entry level players, it does not seem to have the technical ""how to"" that I am looking for. My experience includes player, referee, and coach at many levels. The strengths of this are the detailed bio-mechanics breakdown of basic skills that are vital to player development. These breakdowns also guide the new coach as she analyzes the problem areas in player skill and technique. Book has greatest value to lesser experienced coaches, players and programs."
5,Excellent soccer reference!,"This is an excellent book for experienced and novice soccer fans, parents and coaches alike. I have read several books on different aspects of the game, from skills to drills to tactics, but this book puts it all together in an easy to read and comprehensive single volume. The laws of the game are also included for reference to round off the book."
1,WATCH OUT!,"There are many errors of technique taught here (for example, goalie hand positions). Not a good book."
1,low quality dvd,I've played 2 DVDs of second season.The sound and picture have fallen out of sync so many times I have to wonder if the dvd is a pirate version.If it weren't for the quality of the dvd the item would have 5 stars.
1,Sick,Don't watch this show with your family. Very sick subject matter. Looks like the L's deleted my last comment on here. Warning people that this show is sick is wrong now. WoW.
3,Just wanted to point something out,"Hey ladies and gents. I love the L-world, despite how un-realistic it is but thats part of the enjoyment, however the horrific opening song by the artist betty is nausiatingly bad, but dont you think its a rip off of the song my favorite things from the sound of music? Or was that the idea...?"
5,Excellent SHOWTIME Original !,"The L Word was back for a Second Season On Showtimes Lineup , which I was very glad because every episode in the 1st season was so great and i have watched them so many times on The DVD set. Now finally The 2nd Season is released and i cant wait to see all the Season 2 episodes over agian. The 2nd Season had great plots , a new girl , and other great events during the season.If you have never seen the show it is excellent if you are gay or straight , the series is an excellent drama.Pre order your copy today you will not regret it i know i am not! By The way The new season on SHOWTIME is really great Too. Showtime you have done it agian , First Queer as Folk which is now sadly ending , and Now The L Word , Good For you Showtime You know Groundbreaking Original Series !"
4,L word,"Enjoyed watchin on tv good story lines keep u griped to what's happening next and has girl humour as well, enjoyed every season"
2,First season was brilliant but second season is a huge disappointment,"I was thrilled by the first season's creative and compelling representation of characters. The opening titles, music, dramatizations, editing, as well as, subtle humor of the first season, was an artful and poignant display of life to which many people, regardless of sexual orientation, could relate.I was immediately disappointed by the second season, however, as it quickly dissolved a great work of art and turned it into cheap pulp.I hope that the third and fourth season doesn't make the same mistake."
5,Good,Very good show if you don't have a closed mind. For those that don't like lesbian content don't watch it.
1,Overrated,"Who doesn't like hot lesbians? ...but only the LGBT community really appreciates the ""issues & challenges"" in this series, so ...no universal, long term appeal. This is just another niche series for a niche audience. Years from now, it will be forgotten."
1,A disappointment,Save your $. Season 1 is way better than Season 2. Buy Season 1 instead if you haven't done so.
2,so disappoited about SEASON 2...,"please, forgive me my bad english, because I'm living in Germany.Maybe SEASON 1 was too brilliant, so that the expectations for SEASON 2 were too high. But after looking the first disc of SEASON 2 I was already confused if this was still THE L WORD.The Characters changed in a unexplainable way, the plot is sometimes is so boring that I found me grabbing my remote to play forward and the whole spirit was gone.I felt after every episode in SEASON 1 positive thoughts and the need to find out what's next, but in SEASON 2 I asked myself why I wanted to see more.Nevertheless, I will finish the whole box, but I will also reduce the euphoric fans of L-WORD that this SEASON 2 is nothing compaired to SEASON 1The 3 stars are only for the actors and their try to save the show with their performances."
4,Best in Show- Alice and Dana,"The only reason I got this was to originally see how Alice and Dana came to be a hot couple on the L Word. Not for some perverted reasons! The Helena/Bette feud is almost enough to put on Celebrity Deathmatch. Erin Daniels and Leisha Hailey pull off incredible performances as the hottest couple in this season, only in this season. From 'Rules of Un-Attraction' to the episode ""Loud and Proud"", they are more than worth the final total.They kill off the relationship in the next season and they kill off Dana just when she's recovering from Cancer. That was the worst mistake Elaine Chaiken ever made. Don't even bother renting the next season or watching showtime. Just get this and that will be all you need for loving and living with the L Word."
4,Good storyline- Not Emmy Award material,This is a fun series to watch at home with your wife/gf. It's kind of hokey but sort of fun. The characters grow on you and after watching a few episodes you find that you are cheering for them. So if you buy the DVD and have the right attitude (low expectations) you might enjoy it. Have fun!
3,Mahavishnu wannabe,"I've been a Crimson fan from the beginning. I bought ""Court"" at age 14; it was my first album and still one of my favorites. That said, ""Red"" and other albums by this lineup of KC have never been among my favorites because they are rather pale and obvious imitations of the work of Mahavishnu Orchestra and other jazz/rock fusion bands of that era. Crimson should be Crimson - unique and like no other. KC really didn't come into their own again until the Thrak era."
4,thats more like it,"This album is steller, for lack of a better descriptor..I didn't know what I was getting exactly..which I liked. I didn't do any research on this one. I just bought the album because I liked the track ""Red"" which is the only song I had heard from the album, and I was curious as to what the rest would sound like.My ears sucked it up like juicy beer batterd fish and chips...yummy. Ear candy indeed. Throw this one on yer mp3, iphone song playing thingy and enjoy Bill Brufords playful but seriously tight drumming. He's having a blast. This dark brooding guitar based album is pure seventies, slightly underground music bliss I crave; And I found it!"
5,The amazing Sun Ra,"Sun Ra is an amazing artist with a lot of material. This album was the first I ever heard from Ra. He is amazing. The harmonies and rhythms played by Ra are magnificent. I don't have a lot of Ra's album and therefore cannot make a comparison between this and his other work, but this album is awesome and that is all I have to say...."
3,Strangely good.,"This guy is a great composer with a ""unique"" imagination. It swings, stops, goes a little classical, bops, gets a little free... It covers a wide range. While Sun Ra is known to be a bit strange for some of his beliefs, his musical talents are up there with many of the greats."
2,Complicada de entender,"Entiendo que tiene un premio Alfaguara; pero sinceramente la trama no me gustó. Muy complcada de seguir , llena de personajes interrelacionados. A tal grado que al final es necesario hacer un resumen de acontecimientos para tener un poco más de claridad.No la disfruté y tal vez algun día retome la lectura para entender por qué es que tiene tan buenas reseñas."
5,A beautiful story of love and understanding,"This story, set in Hungary just before World War I, is a delightful story of a young motherless girl who learns the meaning of love and family with her uncle and his family out in the country. It can be enjoyed on many levels - family story, historical novel, ethnic traditions from Hungary, etc. Be sure to follow it up with the sequel ""The Singing Tree"" which tells of the family's life during World War I. Enthusiastically recommended!"
5,A great little trading classic,"In this small, short, quirky, and often humorous book, Adam Smith covers such diverse subjects as crowd psychology, inkblots, and random walks with an irreverant and original point of view.Although this book was originally published in 1976 (and some parts as early as 1967), it still has a good amount of information that is relevant today and goes to show that the saying 'There is Nothing New on Wall Street' is as true today as it was then."
5,I love this book,"""If I really had a system for making money in the market and it worked all the time, first of all, I wouldn't tell anybody and second of all, I would soon have just about all the money there is."" Adam Smith p. 122Thank you for being so honest. Amazingly this book has helped me more than all the other ""How to make millions in the stock market"" books I have read. It is well-written and filled with information, humor, advice and wisdom. It touches on everything from the fabled Mister Johnson (I have a strong suspicion that Peter Lynch got his inspiration for One Up On Wall Street from this book) to charting and random walk theory. The reader is encouraged to find his own trading style and use the wealth of information from the book. Highly recommended."
5,Could have been written by the real Adam Smith,"This book is an excellent take on the Wall Street speculator-financial manipulator crowd as it existed in the late 1960's when the regulatory apparatus had not been captured/deregulated and was still in place to protect the ""sober "" people from the Wall Street crowd of projectors,imprudent risk takers,and prodigals,to use the description of the original Adam Smith.The only problem with this book is that the present day writer who calls himself Adam Smith does not cover the real Adam Smith in a satisfactory way.He does understand his Keynes from the expose made by Keynes in chapter 12 of the GT(1936) about the deleterious impact of the speculators on Wall Street on the economic prospects of Main Street."
5,A Classic,"I've read hundreds of investing books; skimmed hundreds more; even written one myself. But dare it be said: This beautifully written work may well be the best book on the subject ever written. Not because it covers everything, or promises to make you rich. But because it offers timeless insights into how players, amateur and professional, really do play the game, and thereby gives you rich food for thought on how, or whether, you should play. Sure, you won't find anything on program trading, IRAs, 401k's, the great fund boom, or dot com stocks. However, that just goes to show that you needn't read today's papers to truly learn today's market. A bestseller in its day, there is still something for everyone here. Simply put, The Money Game is a classic, the first book on investing you should read."
5,The times change but the stockmarket game goes on,"Written in the late sixties the book reflects its times in the boardrooms and trader pits of Wallstreet. Condesending toward women, hostile to ethnics and gays the book shows a somewhat rough hewn side of the men in the grey flannel suites. The game of generating money from speculation, mass physiology buttressed by modern economic techniques and monatorist policies could be taken from todays headlines. A very entertaining and informative book both from a historical and investing perspectiv"
2,"Not Impressive, not fits the today's market trends",Market and economies of countries are changing... This book is written long back...no more effective as per current trends. Author has told the things that a layman knows how to trade now a days.I will say better interested people should go for new authors that provide a better views as per current money trends.Very dissapointing book for me.
3,Fun but contrived,"I enjoyed watching this show. Seems like the producers thought that they should limit filming of vacuuming gravel and sorting for gold. Actually that's the best part. To replace the filming of actual gold mining, they created false issues and fake fights. I didn't care for the fake drama. I wanted to see more of the mining and the gold."
2,Bad quality,This was made cheap and did not hold my dog securely like in the photo. It was very hard to attach
3,Nice Looking; Bulky; Keeps Terrible Time,"The watch is very nice looking although a little heavy and bulky. The band is pretty stiff when new. I am still trying to loosen it up a little. My biggest problem with this watch is that it keeps terrible time. The analog portion of mine loses about a second a day and the digital part gains a second a day. So the digital and analog are about two seconds apart per day. That may not be a big deal to some, but it drive me nuts."
2,not very good.,"This book is supposed to be a master duelist's guide, but it's not very useful. For effect monsters, it usually doesn't bother listing the effect, and the pictures are too small to read the card print. If I don't have a card, and I'm unfamiliar with it, not telling me what it does or providing me with a well defined picture of the card isn't very helpful. It's got lots of typo errors, and in some instances, the wrong pictures listed for the cards. Not well proofed, and not very helpful."
1,Looks good- impossible to follow,"This book contains some very pretty pictures and cute useless information but when it come to actually using it the instructions that are provided on how to create a basic pattern and size the shoes you are making are almost impossible to follow! The instructions sometimes even refer you to further instructions (""see page 116"" for example) that are not actually there! The book is well presented so it looks like everything should be in order but when you actually really try to put it into practice as I have tried to do (for two days of my holidays!) it just doesn't add up. I have read some other reviews that actually commend the book; the only explainations that I can think of for this is that: 1. the reviewers haven't actually tried following the instructions to make shoes, 2. they are relatives of the author and are trying to promote the book, 3. they have a completely different copy to the one I have."
5,My 1 year old's favorite book!,"This is my son's favorite book. Everytime I get it out to read to him, he giggles & squeals. He absolutely loves it and always is touching the animals furry bodies. And giggles even more when I say Peekaboo!"
5,Cute book.,My little duaghters loved this book when they were toddlers. Very cute. Nicely colored and illustrated. Very durable format -- to be read over and over again.
5,one of my daughter's favorite,"This is one of my 13-month-old daughter's absolute favorite books. It's one of those where we have to go through it 4-5 times before she's ready to put it down, and even then she often comes back to this book. Many times I've found her in her room, quietly turning the pages and making noises at the cute animals. I would highly recommend this book."
4,Peace of Mind.,I purchased this for my 85 year old grandfather. He was wanting something to put at his residence for some added notification of prowlers. The price was very reasonable and the construction seems solid. Installation went very smooth but know that you will need two people to make the installation process easier. According to my grandfather the item works great and he is very happy with it. He is already wanting to add another sensor to it. Great product..
3,the book you should rent,"find it in a library or used, the book is not worth the price of shipping if you buy it new or used. maybe look for mine when i'm done with it (full of common sense things you already know)the service was great though. thanks amazon"
1,Cancel Account,I do not wish to purchase this item because i am being charged for false items on my card that i have not ordered. please cancel my account!
2,Terrible Quality,"Definitley not for someone looking to push a lot of power over a long distance.Actually don't sound to bad if you are working with very low levels, but not for a professional by any means."
3,"Well, okay","This is actually not a very interesting DVD about Bhutan, it is mostly Thurman talking. One more or less expects that one will be given a tour of a Bhutanese temple or two, plus some discussion of Vajrayana Buddhism (he is a world expert), but really one gets mostly elementary Buddhist teaching as filtered through Thurman."
4,"If I am only for myself, what am I?",The trend pointed out in this book toward increasing Jewish retreat from communal participation and responsibility fits in with the wider pattern in American society as a whole. The shift in focus from inherited shared traditional commitment to absolutely autonomous individual choice in defining one's relation to the Jewish community is both a fact of life and a signal of decline. The contradiction to this trend is the improved Jewish education an increasing minority of the community is receiving. Such education ideally does strengthen communal commitment and responsibility.I have heard Steven Cohen speak about the issues raised in this book and had the sense that he was far too optimistic in believing that the very partial and limited kinds of Jewish connection so increasingly prevalent among American Jewry can be a source of real communal strength in the future.
1,Not worth your money,I will keep this short. This book is not worth your hard earned money. I do not recommend it as the test questions are simple and basic and the job descriptions are no different than the information you can get from each agencies web page. Keep on searching as this book does not deliver its value.
1,Big on promises low on value,"For $[...] I was expecting more than a few bits of plastic and card, and a leaflet explaining how to do up to 50 trcks. It's almost exactly the same as a present I recieved as a present 50 years ago. The use of terms such as `sensational' and `European quality' are misleading."
3,Too complicated,This was a little complicated for a young child to comprehend. Might not have been the best decision on my part.
4,MetalMania,"This is a good buy, several different kinds of metal are on this. And many really good bands from Poland most people who claim to be metal never heard.There is a little something for everyone on here. There is 1 dvd of live concert footage and 1 cd of Polish death metal. The live concert footage has good sound, its not just a cheap bootleg. No hardcore/nu metal here, only real metal plus The Exploited(punk-thrash) and anathema(who are weak as heck). I got a good deal on this dvd on amazon for about 7 dollars total, very worth the price. I'd say its even worth shelf price."
1,junk,"This product does not charge my treo 650. I own a votage meter and checked the output and it does, in fact, produce an electric current. However, that current is underpowered. So much so, that it will not even trigger the ""Charging"" signal on my treo 650. This charger is worthless. I would send it back, but shipping cost more than what I was billed for the actual unit, so I guess I can't complain. Do not buy this product. Buy one from a reputable 3rd party. Too bad the replacement charger that Sprint sells is overpriced and falls apart."
4,"""Beautifully crafted prose in praise of pointlessly gifted""","This review is a precis of Adam Bresnick's comments in Forbes Magazine, Feb. 22, '99. Ricky Jay is one of the more engaging figures in American entertainment - a cunning vaudellian, a resourceful actor and a delightful writer. But is is Jay's prose that may prove his most delightful contribution to civilization. Farrar, Straus & Giroux has just reissued Jay's Learned Pigs & Firproof Women, a beautifully crafted homage to some of the most pointlessly gifted individuals the stage has ever seen. ""The Man Who Grows,"" was able to stretch his body from 5 feet, 10 inches, to 6 foot, 4 in front of astonished audiences. Blind Tom, an African-American idiot savant of the 19th century, had no formal musical education, yet upon hearing a song, he could immediately duplicate it on the piano. Read about these and more - this book is a masterful performance itself and is sure to beguile even the most skeptical reader with its unremiting weirdness."
4,Greta's Kiss,"I strongly urge all to experience this movie. At a time when silents were just about over in favor of talking Pictures, Garbo remained silent and ever so popular. This was one of the highest grossing films of the year 1929.It would be Garbo's last silent. The story is full of romance and intrigue and tainted love. Beautifully photographed, with sets and costumes to compliment. This movie introduced Lew Ayers, who would become a matinee idol and lead actor throughout the coming decade. But again the movie belongs to Greta Garbo. The moods, the emotions, the kissing, the forced laughs, gestures. Its Garbo. The actress, the enigma and the legend. Experience, The Kiss."
5,Memory Lane,"I was SO happy when I saw that this set was availibe.I loved G Gundam when it was on Cartoon Network, but I was so depressd when the series finished.I longed to see my first anime love and finally now I can whenever I want!!! This is a great set and I would also recamend getting the fourth set (this one is the third,and the fourth one is the last one) so you can see how Domon and Rain's relationship works out!!!:)"
5,Filled with twist and turns,"I just love the ability to download these pulp stories on my kindle and a great price of .99 cents now thats entertainment.This is a great story filled with twist and turns while also taking a look into the world of a writer. The main character works for a publisher and his biggest client is accused of murdering his wife. Do they embrace the incident as a marketing ploy, or is the DA going to convince the jury someone who write dark subject matter lives in the world of drastic deeds."
4,Good concise commentary,"This commentary on Daniel is concise. It does a very good job of keeping the reader focused on two main topics, mainly the topic of people of God living in an ungodly world such as Daniel in Babylon, and the topic of the prophecies as revealed in the book of Daniel. The comentary also does a very good job of relating the various parts of the book of Daniel, such as the vision of the statue of various types of metal compared to the vision of the animals. And I especially liked the dealing with the prophecy of the coming Anointed One and the seventy ""sevens""; the commentary did not go into elaborate detail, which can be very interesting but which might be out of place in a commentary such as this which is concise; the high level presentation of three different possibilities and their calculations of the seventy ""sevens"" was well done."
5,Excellent as usual,"You can't go wrong with any expositional commentary written by Dr. Boice. I especially appreciate his honesty. He obviously is from a reformed background, but in terms of his eschatology and his own interpretation, he often gives credence the viewpoints of premillenialism.Daniel is a difficult book to study but Dr. Boice is able to break it down in such a way that it is easy to grasp and see the big picture through out."
4,Excellent,"Magical collection of Saimak's short stories!!! Saimak is definitely is one of the best sci-fi writers of all-times, but unfortunately he is the most unappreciated one in my opinion. If you haven't read Saimak before - this collection is a wonderful way to get acquainted with his works - incredibly humane, compassionate, inventive and original. There is not a single one bad story in this collection, so it's definitely worth getting."
3,Somewhat boring,There's a lot of information here but the book is often slow and dull and too wordy and pretentious for my tastes. Less is more.
4,Helpful,"I had over 800 dvds. I had to buy two of these and figured i'd give them a try. It takes time to set up. You place a movie in it's sleeve and on a sheet with the numbers write the name of the dvd. If u fill this it can take a long time. Once done though so long as you keep it in order it will save u time and hassle. I want to watch a movie, i grab my list and comb my finger down until i find the title i need. I then look for the number next to it when i do and flip to it in the case. What used to take me 30 minutes in my old cases now takes maybe 3 or 4. I really like this product and recommend it if you have a LOT of dvd's or cd's to store."
2,Tom's of Maine...Dental tape,"It has to be good if I order it in from the USA into Canada...and the cost of the floss is expensive but the shipping is double so the 6 packs cost me $50+...again, it has to be good to pay that kind of money ! It is the best floss on the market !"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BANK!,"As an educational toy, this product is a failure. It does NOT consistently recognize the coins correctly. About 75% of the time it was wrong. Not a good way to teach kids! Also, the bank we received stuttered constantly like a record skipping and would not shut off. Bad product all around!"
1,would be better as bacon.,miscounts. resets. and rarely recognizes the coins.excellent idea. but piss poor execution.just pass on this one.
2,This is a Costco dud,"This Sharp TV is NOT sharp! Cheap, but you do get what you pay for. We were told at Costco that ""Don't worry, this isn't a discontinued model or anything like that"". Baloney. That's just what it is. The picture is marginal at best. Do yourself a big favor and spend a few more dollars to upgrade!"
5,Little Piggy,As always the Pearls cast is entertaining. Pearls is only for those who appreciate Pastis' humor.
4,Very goog,"the radius is very pretty, its sound is clear but it had been far better if kept in memory completes song with respect to the sound mp3 usb port. whenever I extinguish it begins from the beginning and always I listen to the same songs since usoun massive storage device as 80 gb is a portable hard disk of... but is a good radius of general way"
1,Bad book,"Total rubbish. Awkward dialog, jerky action, 2-dimensional characters, convenient coincidences strung together. Looks more the the very rough outline of the concept of a book project that was never finalized. Many ridiculous situations, including: the East Germans keep hands off the family farm; a character goes to a meeting with Saddam Hussein and the official car he's in--and his escort officers--are successfully waylayed by a bunch of street punks. Totalitarian regimes don't work like that. And there's lots of cliche-ridded stuff about loyal retainers who would willingly die for whoever it is they're willing to die for. I paid nothing for this book (got it as a gift), and it's probably worth less than that. Don't waste your money."
2,Don't Bother,"This was the first, and probably last, book of Higgins that I read. The consensus opinions are right about this - poorly plotted, rushed ending, boring villians, and cardboard heroes.The initial premise is fairly captivating; Hitler's diary saved from the bunker in Berlin, and the potentially world-shaking secrets held within. The problem is that the promise of the concept never delivers. Ultimately, I felt the great secret in the diary was not so astonishing, and would have little relevance anymore 60 plus years after the war.The 'cameo' of Saddam Hussein was forced at best, and didn't add anything to the story. I found the dialogue to be wooden and terribly cliched. The best parts of this book were the early scenes set in WWII. Once the story advanced to the present day, all the interest was lost as it became a fairly typical by-the-numbers thriller. You could expect this level of story-telling from an episode of most crime dramas on tv."
1,Higgins should have disowned this book,"from an ordinary author, this book would be acceptable. it wouldn't be great, but not all books are. from higgins, this is shameful. if sean dillon were real, he would want to ""pay a visit"" to higgins for writing this...."
1,"The Beagle Has Landed (or, Higgins delivers a dog)","Jack Higgins is just spinning his wheels in this boring ""thriller"" that recycles his usual cast of characters with very little new interest (and is anyone else besides me getting tired of them?). The ""McGuffin"" in this book is so weak that one wonders why this crack team of international tough guys even cares about it. Everyone walks through the paces without much reflection or embellishment. I agree with another poster that ""SOLO"" and ""EAGLE"" are top-form Higgins and should be where new readers start.The audio version with Patrick Macnee takes it down a notch. I loved P.M. in The Avengers, and he has a great voice, but as a book reader he goes WAY over the top emotionally. Every line of dialog is read with undue intensity, like in a corny stage melodrama, and his Italian accent is so bad that I laughed every time he used it."
1,I wish I could give it 0 star; what a waste of paper,To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. This books lacks any suspense. The plot was phoned in. Other than some of the characters there is no resemblence between this book and other Jack Higgins books. Do not think of buying this book. Avoid borrowing it from the library. Use your time to read any other other Jack Higgins book.
1,"Pitiful, Abominable","This is the worst book in this entire genre, which is saying a lot. The plot is so thin, the characters so stupid and stereotypical. For example, high-level, British gov't-sponsered assassins/special agents discuss their plans outloud in public places and are...shocking!...overheard! One guy ""confesses"" to a priest/psychiatrist all the details of his crimes, in a church with his arch-enemy listening in the wings. Sort of a Laurel and Hardy version of a Tom Clancy thriller. How Higgins got to be a millionaire from writing is beyond me. This one was written by the proverbial hundred monkeys randomly pounding keys. No offense to any monkeys out there."
1,The worst Jack Higgings ever!!!,"This has got to be the worst ever Higgins book. Though the author has hit past home runs (the Eagle has landed), this is a really terrible effort. He creates potentially interesting characters, only to kill them off with a sentence pages later. He sets up poitential conflicts (the leading bad guy is given Hitler's diary to safekeep) only to never make it a significant part of the plot--seems that all the Baron got was billions to spend on his own companies! He even sets up potential surprises (Dillon hiding a gun against the moment when the nasties surprise him) only for it never to be used. Higgins, I suspect, wrote this book only after a martini or two. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!"
3,Higgins Strikes Again,"It's the same cast of characters--General Ferguson and Sean Dillon--teaming up again. I particularly enjoyed the beginning, in Hitler's bunker during the last days of WWII. I liked the character of Max Von Berger, an SS officer who was destined to be the keeper of Hitler's secret diary. This book is not Higgins at his best. But, is still better writing than one gets from most authors."
1,Bad Company - Bad Writing,"If you know anything about writing you won't enjoy this book. If you are devoid of information about plot development, characterization and drama you might give this two stars.Isn't there anyone to tell Higgins this is terrible?"
1,Did Anyone Care About Any Of These Characters?,"This is the first Jack Higgins' book I've ever read, and I regret that I've even read it at all. What a waste of my time! I almost couldn't and didn't want to finish it. Since I don't have any prior knowledge of all the characters that appeared in other Higgins' books, I thought, except for Baron Von Berger, NONE of the characters have developed enough depth for me to know and to even care about them. As far as I know they're nothing but a group of thugs and murderers that are feuding over personal vindication in the name of contrived heroic excuses. Halfway through the book, as soon as Baron Von Berger faded into oblivion, I started losing interest in this book. The motivation for Von Berger to declare war against Dillon & Ferguson over Kate Rashid was, at best, weak and contrived. I couldn't find character to relate to or to root for. The plot's thin and the emotion's void. It's extremely disappointing."
2,"Bad Company, Bad Book","Will the real Jack Higgins please stand up. Used to be all you had to do was see the name Jack Higgins and you just HAD to buy the book because it would be a winner. Not this time. Maybe it's the glut of World War II books or the interest in maniacal psychopaths such as Hitler, Stalin, Saddam, but this book didn't interest me whatsoever. The plot -- if you really want to call it a plot -- doesn't start until mid-read, and it is a very hazy plot at that. The ending was not an ending, but more of a stop sign -- put up at the end of a circuitous road involving a search for Adolph's Swiss bank fortune. Too many characters, good guys and bad guys, spoil the too-leisurely flow of the story line."
1,"Jack, what where you thinking?","Jack Higgins had some incredible books, but this is.... one word that comes to mind ""terrible"". Its confusing, badly written, hurried (especially the end). Higgens can do and has done much, much better. The book actually upset me since the bad guys seemed to be the good guys and the good guys the bad.Better luck next time. Don't bother reading this book, unless you want to turn the last page with a very sour look on your face. Suprised it was even published. Read The Eagle has Landed, its great.Hope this helped."
3,A Toss-Away Read!,"Entertaining and interesting? Yes. A true thriller? Way too predictable to meet that standard. There's no real punch, no real suspense, no real substance and no real characters. It's more like a fast-paced Harlequin read for men. In that respect, 'Bad Company' meets Higgins' commercial goal, but with the number of new military thriller and suspense authors as well as authors like Ken Follett who still stretch their capabilities to achieve five-star thrillers, 'Bad Company' is truly disappointing."
4,Losing steam!,"If your looking for more of the same thats what you'll find with Jack's latest in the Sean Dillon saga. Other then an admirable attempt to present a softer Sean to the readers, this is a story that is just as exciting as the others in the series but no more so. Personally I don't have a problem with the ""more of the same approach,"" but it does cause one to wonder whether the story is losing steam.I enjoyed the book because I love Jack Higgins. However I do hope the series will add a new twist sometime soon."
3,An Appropriate Title for this Book!,"It has been a while since I have read Higgins and I realize I have not missed him. I loved his earlier works, but this was pretty boring. It starts with promise, tracking a S.S. Officer who is entrusted with Hitler's secret diary. This fact amounts to basically nothing and we follow his career to current day where he has become a business tycoon. He finds himself at odds with Sean Dillon and the rest of the plot was like watching paint dry. And as Forest Gump said, ""That's all I've got to say about that"". If you want WWII related plots, read ""Black Cross"" by Greg Iles or ""Sands of Sakharra"" by Glenn Meade."
1,"This book is old news, nothing new or useful was learned.",For all his talk of making the 8 track church into a CD one he gave no insights or ideas. Everything he said was unclear and general and I came away with nothing of value.
4,"Decent, but not perfect.","I bought this for my Macbook Pro when I first got it, and used it a few times. It was great and all, but I have a few small complaints. Firstly, velcro. Velcro is loud. Very loud. And if you're late for a class, and you manage to sneak in without the professor noticing, you'll still have to rip it open and turn heads.Secondly, it's thin. Not very thin, but fairly thin. Thin enough to feel the inside from the outside, and enough to make you worry if you place it down too hard.4/5. Fits great, feels nice, but velcro and lack of protection merits only 4 stars."
5,The Best For Breast,"I was introduced to PureLan in the hospital when my son first latched on. As a result from my son not latching on properly, my nipples became cracked, sore, and dry. PureLan was my lifesaver to happy nursing!"
4,bessie smith + edith piaf = colette magny,"the very fine artistry of colette magny is a rare moment of making love of heaven and earth - the music comes from the deepest ground of human genesis and leads you to the highest state of heavenly ascension - nevertheless the music is very, very simple, a kind of real naive art, very normal, most of you listeners will only hear very ""normal"" music, but you have to listen to the ground of colette magny's voice, the deep sound of women, of mother earth, open your ears, clean them off all radio-stuff and of all all-day-noise, go through the storm, to get an empty head, and then listen, listen, listen deep and blind - if you're lucky, you will never forget and you will never be alone through your further life!"
5,Great CD. Gets better the more you listen to it.,"Great tango CD. The arrangements here are strikingly powerful, and the execution is perfect.Daniel Binelli is a truly original artist. Some people prefer Mederos, maybe because Mederos' style is more approachable. It is true that Binelli's pathos sounds a little bit over the top at times, and I generally prefer the arrangements of Mederos, because they are generally more gentle and nostalgic. However, I think Binelli is a better bandoneon player because he has a more solid technique.The first track on this CD, Al pintor Aldo Serveri, is a true masterpiece. I also particularly enjoyed Linda Lee Thomas' solo piano version of Paris desde aqui, so nostalgic. Actually, nearly all the tracks on this CD are great, and they get even better the more you listen to them. It is that kind of CD.I have to agree that this is, so far, the best tango CD of 2002."
3,College percussion ensemble stuff,"Having hung out with experimental percussion groups at Cal San Diego and Cal State Hayward,I find this is pretty much influenced by Stockhausen and Varese( Ionization) percussive type things.Does it work?It depends.I feel that it needs to be more seamless and transition better between the percussive effects and the rest of the group.If your going to use such an approach,try doing what Ambrosia did using the Cal Arts Ensemble on Some where I Never Traveled.It's a nice try,but it leaves me cold most of the time.I would not recommend to anybody but hard core college musicians.More of an academic musing than anything else.Doesn't work for me.As for you folks that rated my review as unhelpful,if you'll notice the resale value on this item starting at 1 cent.As noted before,this is an not a mainstream product,in fact ,this may belong in the experimental section more than it does in the jazz section."
4,A meaty twice a day devotional,"Robert Hawker was a minister in the Church of England in the 18th and 19th centuries. He wrote these devotionals intending them to be sold for a penny to the poorer people in his parish. Morning and evening portions means that there are two devotions to read each day, and the portions range from half a page to up to two pages. He does see Christ in every verse, and draws out a spiritual teaching from verses where I wouldn't have ever thought to look. He is constantly writing about Christ, love to Christ, the great themes of redemption, and the glory of God. I found the devotional difficult to read out loud with my wife. Hawker's writing takes some concentration just to read it. I found myself going back over sentences often to catch exactly what he was saying. In all, I liked it and recommend it, though I still prefer Spurgeon'sMorning and Evening: Daily Readings."
4,Another Trollope Winner,"Trollope is a great writer and this is among his best novels: less well knwn than Orley Fam and the Barcheter nevels, it deserves to be included with these as one of his best."
3,Collection of thoughtful reflections,"I poorly chose to read this book straight through and feel I did not give it enough time to sink in. This is a compilation of more or less random musings by the emperor, and while there are themes that seem to surface, it can jump around a bit. Still, his tenets appeal both to logic and emotion, effectively placing themselves in your mind for review throughout the day.The introduction by Gregory Hays does a good job setting up the collection, explaining the format and picking out some of the main ideas. In retrospect, I was impressed with how cohesive the intro made the book and feel I would have been bewilderingly lost without it or some other semi-summary."
5,Excellent read,Timeless knowledge for the aspiring students of a higher level of consciousness in a tumultuous world
2,chicken soup for something,This translation was a bit too dumbed down for me. Maybe I'm showing my age but the idea of a Roman emperor speaking like a New Age Guru didn't do it. That being said it is still soothing to read these thoughts.
4,I love M. A. Antonio 's Spiritual Exercises,"This translation may not be perfect, but it is a good resource for wise choice making. Although, Marcus Aurelius persecuted Christians (a sect in his time) his virtues and stoic philosophy grant him the ability to be a distinct spiritual artist. I prefer to replace his ""gods"" with God and his force against Christians as a force against sects or being part of bad crowds or better yet ignored. There is no substitute for the bible, but his spiritual exercises should be recognized as good."
1,Doesn't work for all ereaders as it states,Went through all of the steps.Call customer support and it's still not downloading just sitting in my archives...smh.If your don't have a Kindle don't bother waisting your time.None of them work for Android Tablets
1,horrible production,"I have to agree with the other negative reviewers -- the book is almost unreadable. The introduction is filled with random text characters, and it's just ugly. The translation is also difficult to read. The volume contains no information at all about who did the translation or when it was done. It's really awful. I ended up buying another version of the book elsewhere."
3,"Excellent material, lackluster publishing","Anyone looking to purchase the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius most likely wants a nice, tangible edition to add to their collection. I say this because you can access his Meditations, for free (and legally of course) on a variety of educational websites. With that said, the publication itself is very plain Jane. The formatting leaves MUCH to be desired. My main complaint is that the words flow quite deep into the binding where the outer margin would have had plenty of room. Whoever designed this for S&B; Publishing did a very poor job. Especially considering the book (new) costs 8.50+ shipping. Simply put, it's not worth the money.My recommendation? Look for another edition."
5,"""A man's life is what his thoughts make of it."" --Aurelius","I have two translations of this book--one by Andy Fiala, and the the other by Gregory Hays. Hays' is far superior, and comes through very clear. I found it surprising how much different translations were and would highly recommend juxtaposing different versions before making any purchase.Most of the reviews below did a wonderful job describing the book already, so I feel no need to; but will add that Marcus Aurelius was a great and virtuous Roman emperor who could of had it all but instead demonstrated the beauty in living simply with self-discipline, self-mastery, and self-control."
3,"Decent, Hard to Read at Times but Understandable with a Classic",I wanted to learn more about Marcus Aurelius and see his view of things millenia ago. It was hard to follow various figures and stories sometimes. Could have used a few pictures!
1,terrible edition,"I have to agree with the review below. The poor editing and number of mistakes in this edition are outrageous. I had never before heard of this so called ""Book Jungle"" company, but they should be put out of business for selling useless products like this one."
3,Typos in text were distracting!,"Can't complain about the content of Meditations, but the number of typos was disappointing and annoying for a text like this."
2,Poor translations,I've read this book in school in the past and this translation doesn't do this book justice. It makes it more difficult to read almost. Don't recommend this version at all.
2,"poor translation, Staniforth is much better",Excellent book but the George Long translation is as inscrutable as the King James Bible without having entered into the English language tradition
3,Nothing original,"This is not the best translation. The Walter J. Black,Inc. 1944 Classic Club Edition is better, but either way it is just Marcus Aurelius trying to remind himself (over and over again) of the basic stoic theory that as long as we know what pertains to us and what doesn't and avoid gettting emotional about what doesn't pertain to us, all will be fine and tranquil within our souls. It reads like the book of Proverbs, jumping from topic to topic without much organization and with lots of repetition of the same basic themes with a few word changes. Many times, I felt like I was reading a remake of Epictetus Discourses, only not as well written by any stretch of the imagination. Not much of anything new or original, just a follower of a philosophy better stated by Epictetus (or should I say his student admirer, Arrian, who wrote the Discourses from first hand lectures he had heard.)"
3,"Great stuff, but get another version","The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is a great book, but this version is written a tad bit too archaically. I would suggest purchasing another version, one which does not need to be deciphered line by line so much."
3,Old English,"Old English translation, there are more recent and better understandable translations out there, I would recommend seeking those out first!"
3,More than a casual read,"One of those books that you can't read casually and in small snippets. This is more a book that requires you to spend the time with, read slowly and think about what is being said. I was surprised at how short the book actually turned out to be, with almost half of the book dedicated to analysis.This book is one of those that you put on your shelf and refer back to again and again. Doing so will ensure that you get the most from it. The ideas in the book are not earth shattering they are all simply good common sense but sometimes it is actually beneficial to have these presented to you in another form.A good book but one that cannot certainly be casually. It is however a book that can be read over and over and each time something new can be gleaned from its pages."
5,meditations,this is the finest translation of marcus aurelius's meditations that i have read. previous translations i have read were loaded with so many thee's and thou's that the reading was tedious and slow. i found my self scanning the pages instead of reading until i would come across an obvious jem. this made me oblivious to the hidden jems that make up this excellent work. this book gives the emperor's words a modern flair that doesn't lose the original flavor. i highly recommend it.
4,Interesting Work,This is one of the most incredible works that I have read. It's is interesting to hear wisdom that applies even today from someone who lived so long ago. My only complaint is that the translation could have been better. Some of the thoughts run on and on and on making this a difficult read sometimes.
1,Not what i expected,It was not about what i thought it was going to be about. not my type of book. i was expecting a meditation book
1,not available for peoples living in AFRICA ?,Why are we not supposed to read this book ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
4,Excellent format/condition,"The book was in mint condition. The translation was perfect and well organized. The only thing that could have made this purchase better, is if the book itself was larger and the pages were stronger."
3,CONFUSED over the 2002 edition by Hays,I am looking for a review on the 2009 edition not the 2002 edition by Hays. The reviews on the page of the 2009 edition relate to the 2002 edition. This includes the offical Amazon review.Any input on the 2009 edition?
5,meditations of great man,"This book, which is full of good will and good advices for every reader was written by great man, who did only one mistake in his remarkable life. This only one mistake (concerning the succession), which was done at the end of his life clearly proved that he was still a man, despite the fact that he reached almost the ideal form of the humanity."
2,"Great book, terrible translation","If you want a single, good translation of the Meditations, this is not the one to get. The translation is awkward, unwieldy, and outdated with lots of ""thou dost""-type phrasings. I've ordered the Penguin version after being very impressed with their highly readable translation of Seneca's ""Letters from a Stoic"". I may keep this edition around for reference and comparison but I can't recommend it."
2,meditations,"I really like Marcus Aurelius and his meditations, but I really did not like this interpretation. The author uses words like ""hath"" and ""feareth"". These meditations were originally written in Greek and this book was published in 2009, so I don't see any good purpose for the pontificating classical English interpretation. And such a translation warrants a warning of some kind. ""This material is an inaccurate contextualization of the original work, which suggests a time and place disconnected from the actual time and place the author lived in. The original work has been interpreted using a language style foreign to both, the original author and the modern reader"". That being said, it may really appeal to Shakespearean junkies."
3,I think that it could use some more happy times in it.,"I find myself getting lost in his books,and really enjoy reading them. I collect as many of his books as I can find,but here in Kansas they're really scarse. When I'm lucky enough to find them;then I buy all that I can. This book kept me interested all the way through,but I do wish he could find some measure of happiness in his adventures somewhere. Keep up with the writting they are great!"
2,Poor Image quality,Stated as High Definition quality on the cover.Played the DVD but it was not HD quality. Poor image resolution.
2,Blah!!!,"I didn't like it so much,it's gonna be really hard for to finish it now!!!!!I'm not sure I want to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good but disapointing,"I was amazed to find this in Wal-mart the other day. I readily grabbed it being a big fan of the game and as a pre KH2 snack. I wasn't overly impressed, more pleased. The story is true to the game, but at some points there are plot holes where unless you have played the game you'd have no clue what was going on. The artist did a good job of rendering the characters much like the game art. This is a worthy purchase alone for the price, even though it's not as long as most manga. They probably should have made it longer so that at least the plot was more fluid. If you are a fan of KH, buy it. If you're a fan of manga or graphic novels then you might want to think before buying."
1,Again unavailable,"This book to must have become very popular because it became unavailable as did another Kingdom Heart book that I ordered for my grandson did. I was updated by email for months that it was still on backorder, then Amazon promptly refunded my money. Thanks Amazon."
2,Didn't help,"This product made absolutely no difference in my digestive symptoms. It also tastes terrible, and is hard to measure a dose, since the dosage is measured in drops but it didn't come with a dropper."
2,Wish it worked...,"I took Iberogast faithfully for two weeks before every meal and saw absolutely no change at all. Actually, when I took it, it made my stomach a bit queasy. I sure wish it worked; back to the drawing board... :("
3,unrealistic,"totally hard to believe. i bought this book and i was surprised. it was not what i thought.the school Elliot goes to is more of a nightmare than a real school. those wacko bullies must have brain damage. they base all their ways on a book called ""1984"". it is a real book. there are spies all over the high school workign for the ""guardians""-who are the directors and leaders of the bullying. some think the teachers are even in on it.Elliot is bullied when he does not follow the rules. and so Elliot takes some moneya nd remakes himself to fit better. next thing ya know he is being asked to be part of the group?dosnt make sense to me, but what ever. i think this story could only be a fantasy. if you want a book that takes place in a crazy world, here ya go-->"
1,Inventing Elliot,"Inventing Elliot is about a boy named Elliot who is pretty popular at school,but not in the way he wanted to be.He got beat up and picked on at school everyday. Finally he went to a new school where he found out about a gang of kids called the guardians.The gaurdians randomly select kids to beat up.The guardians want Elliot to join them. Will he join them? You will have to read the book to find out.I think this book sucks.I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes reading good books.I would give this book a rating of 1 out of 5 because it is really boring.The author spent 5 pages talking about a swirley.If i were you I wouldn't read this book unless someone paid me to."
2,Simply awful,"I know the book is aimed at ""young adults"" but I cannot help pointing out that over 100 pages of psycho-babble with a ""see the end from 20 miles away"" style is just horrible to read! If you have actually read 1984 then leave this ""book"" alone!"
2,A boring but okay book,"The book I read was Inventing Elliot. This book was slightly boring, like at the beginning. It took about 5 pages to have the kids at his school, Holminster High, to give Elliot a swirly.The book was about a teenager named Elliot that went to a new school, but when he got there he was the new target! He started to be more popular when he got to be a Guardian, or leader of his new school. I might recommend this book to people who might like these kind of books. I would rate it a 3 stars. Some people could think it is good, others maybe not. I would maybe recommend Inventing Elliot."
4,My Review,"The story begins with a teenager named Elliot trying to start a new life with his mom and dad. Elliot's new school is anything but ordinary though and he soon learns about the ""Guardians"" that rule Holminster High School.They are cruel, and randomly select targets to torture. Elliot soon learns that the Guardians want him; not as a target but to join them. Will he become his own worst nightmare? Read this great, detailed book to find out! I reccomend it. Although the book is a little confusing at times, i would still give it 4 stars! :)"
3,Inventing Elliot Book Review,"This book is about a boy named Elliot. His dad was beaten and his family had to move away from that town. When Elliot gets to his new house he must come over many obstacles. These obstacles incude his family, school, and making new friends. But when Elliot finds out he could have it all, he takes it. If Elliot wants to rule, he has to become a bad kid, the same thing that beat up his dad, and what he feared the most in his old school. I rated this book a 3 because some parts were very slow and the ending was horrible. This book was also sort of good because parts were very captive, interesting, and also odd. I would not recommend this book to kids."
5,"Inventing Elliot ""The Best Book for All !""","This book is a wonderful story about a kid that is going though things that kids like me go through evey day. You aways have to act a certin way to be cool, but thats not who u really are. Elliot shows parents and kids what you have to do to be cool,to fit in, to not be notice in the wrong way. when I read this book it put me in his shoes seeing what i've went through again.I think this is a great book for everyone to read,to see how you acted to be in and not to be weird,strange or anything other people do not think is normal.Bullying is something that is getting worse every day. Reading this book will make you think twice before you strat picking on that kid that is always quiet,that never wants to be with others. I love this book. I am so glad that My teacher(Mrs. Patsel) had me read this! Thank you all for read this . I hope you like this book a lot.I know I sure did!"
3,For Beginners,I love this book buz im not expert in cooking. This was served as my guide. Perfect for Beginners & it comes with nice packaging.
1,waste of money,"we got this when our son was 10 months, within a week he was pulling it off and playing with it. on the plus side it is easy to put on. total waste of money."
1,Nice idea but completely useless,"I bought this crib rail cover thinking that it would be nice to be able to remove it for cleaning. But, like other reviewers have indicated, the 4 pieces of this crib rail cover can be TOO easily removed - by a baby. My 8 month old thought these were toys - he'd continually remove them and either toss them on the floor or sit and play with them in his crib. He'd then proceed to chew on the bare crib rail. So...while these are nice 'in theory', they're useless for the intended purpose. I've since purchased the Gummi crib rail cover and my little one enjoys chewing on that. Hopefully, it'll stay put for a good long while :)."
3,Served the purpose,"Over all this product did basically what I expected it to. In response to the review about it peeling off, there were specific instructions about how to clean and prep the rail. I prepped one side of our crib better than the other and this product did stay on that side much better. After a few months of chewing and pulling at it, my daughter did get the side I hadn't prepped well pulled up enough that we had to take it off. My daughter is 2 1/2 and she still has this teether on one side of her crib, so that side definitely stayed on well.A big reason I bumped it down a couple of stars is that it took some of the paint off my crib rail when I pulled it off the first side. I would have been more upset about this if it were a more expensive crib, but it was a fairly cheap light-color crib and barely shows the chip. This would have been much more annoying if they were more noticable. But for what we wanted, it served our purposes well."
1,pulls right off,My 13 months old son popped them right off. What's the point if he can just take them off and then chew on the rails. Do not buy this!
1,Hunk of Junk!,"I purchased this product because my then 7 month old had started pulling up and chewing on his crib. I am not happy with his crib, so I plan to get a new one for the next baby, but I am concerned about him ingesting stain from the crib. The set of four does not cover the entire side of the crib, nor does it fit flush. It's too small. My crib rail isn't that wide. Plus, my son can and does remove them easily within minutes of being in his crib. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this product!"
1,"Great entertainment for your toddler, but does nothing to protect the crib","My toddler figured out how to take this off and it was great entertainment for him. Each time he didn't want to go down for a nap, these were 4 more items he could toss from the crib to show his discontent.We just got the rubber/gummy teether that attaches with adhesive strips, hopefully this will provide more protection for the already chewed on rail."
3,Works fine,"I think it works fine. Luckily it fits my crib perfectly (I have the Oeuf Classic Crib) I had to purchased 3 boxes to go around all 4 sides of my crib and the corners are still without the guard but my daughter doesn't go ""at it"" there so its fine. 4 pieces are needed for one side of the crib. It will have visible seams which isn't pretty but serves its purpose. She's 8 months old so she hasn't figured out if it comes off or not. Our crib is white and the clear teething guard is actually a blue/purple tinted clear so don't expect totally clear. I gave it 3 stars because I'm not certain it won't be thrown across the room within a few months.....we'll see."
1,Didn't fit my standard crib,"Wish I'd read the Amazon reviews before trekking down to BRU and buying these. Everything posted here is true: they don't fit my VERY standard crib rail, look like they'd easily pry off even if they did, and -whew!- the plasticky odor makes me wonder how safe it would be for baby to be knawing on them all the time. They're going back!!I guess these would probably fit a portable crib with a small rail, but I can't recommend them for anything else, if you can get them to work at all."
1,SAFETY HAZZARD!!! DON'T BUY!!,"I agree with everything everyone else wrote about these devices not working. My daughter was 8-months-old when she figured out how to take them off and throw them. What wasn't mentioned was the huge safety hazzard these plastic pieces pose. After months of throwing them off and chewing on the wood anyway, they caused my daughter to have a pretty bad fall. One morning, right in front of me, my daughter crawled up and held onto the plastic railings. The plastic came off the railing as my daughter was holding on to it, and she fell backward to hit her head hard on the rails in the back of the crib. That was the last time it was on her crib. Also, since there are four plastic pieces that aren't joined together, there is risk of finger pinching."
1,Doesn't work on thick rails,We bought this teether assuming it would fit all cribs. Our crib has pretty thick rails and the teether didn't fit in at all. It seems like all high end cribs have thick rails. This teether seems like it'll work well for thinner rails.
1,Did not work at all,My 13 month old immediately pulled off the covers and started playing with them. She loved them and thought they were a cool new toy but they did not do the intended job. They pull off very easily even though they were a perfect fit on the rail.
2,Only good for small rails,"These products are sturdy, but they are rather small and only fit a small rail. I am unable to get them on my crib all the way, so my son is able to pull them off easily, defeating the purpose of putting them on. My rail is only about 2"" wide, but too wide for these. Would be great for a thin rail crib."
1,Fun toy but not good for protecting the crib!,"Just to reiterate the other reviews - this is my 15 month old's favorite initial activity during naptime. She takes off all 8 of them (both sides) and waves them around. She then bangs them together, bangs them on the walls, and eventually throws them on the ground. Lots of fun for her but totally not serving their purpose (protecting the crib rail). I'll be buying something else."
1,A Waste!,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product. I bought these crib rail protectors and my twin boys figured out how to remove them within a few days and they are under 9 months old. So not only did I waste my money purchasing these, but both of my cribs also have a bunch of teeth marks... exactly what I was trying to avoid. What a waste!"
1,Doesn't fit standard crib,"Waste of money! Claims it fits standard cribs, doesn't at all. It just pops off ... However I found another use for this item I use it as a door jam stopper so my little guy doesn't smash his fingers.. but for a rail cover its a waste of money."
4,"Works, Inexpensive","This product fits our older crib well, it's pretty narrow. After a couple days our daughter was able to pull one off and still chew on the crib. It was really not a problem, my husband just put zip ties on each one and now they protect the crib fine.It works good and was an inexpensive fix."
3,Sort of works,"It does the job till my kid realized she could pull it off. I tied it down with ribbon after that and it's fine now. She doesn't even try to bite it, just plays with the ribbon occasionally. Just make sure if you do tie it down with something that its something that can't be eaten or pulled off easily by your kid."
2,"need 3 sets to cover his crib, too easily removed",I like the idea but in reality didn't work for us. We would have had to order 3 sets to cover the 4 sides of his crib which gets pricey. The length (from top to bottom) is not enough for his crib either - his rails are more like 2 or 3 inches. So he can get his bottom chompers underneath these and still go to town on the wood. And of course he pulls them off easily and throws them to the floor too (11 months). I'm going to order some cloth ones that can be safely tied on-not interested in a DIY project when it comes to ties and cribs.
3,Need to order two sets,"I ordersd these rails because I had my crib refinished. I didn't want the baby chewing on a painted surface. When I got the box there were 4 pieces that are 12 inches long a piece. No where does it say that this only covers one of the rails. I would suggest that you order two sets. Otherwise, you will have big gaps between the two pieces that the distributor suggests you put on each crib rail and they will be pretty much worthless."
2,frustrating protection,I bought this product to protector the front rail of my son's crib from being a teething toy. It fits well but my son is able to pull each of the four pieces off. He plays with them then chunks them from his crib and proceeds to chew on the crib rail again. I am not happy with this purchase and will replace the plastic protection system with a cloth protector in the near future.
2,not BPA free!,"Warning - the packaging does NOT SAY this product is BPA free, which I assume means it isn't BPA free. I gave it two stars because it's better than my kid chewing paint and splinters, but I'm going to replace it with a cloth cover as soon as I can get one."
2,Too narrow.,"Too narrow. Did not fit my 1"" rail. I tried to jam it in but that did not work. If you have really narrow rails, this might work. I had to return the item."
2,crap!,waste of money... my son takes them off and throws them at me everyday and still chews on the crib rails...
1,Removed from Crib,"I just purchased and in the first day, my eight month old pulled these from the crib. The individual smaller pieces made it easy for him to do so. Will return and purchase one that's one long piece. It's a shame, because these were made in the USA."
3,Be sure to measure before you buy!,"I've had the same problems as some other reviewers - did not fit the side rails where my 10 month old chews, and even when put on the front rail where they appeared to fit fine, they are easily removed by the baby.Since they don't fit the sides where she chews, I don't really know how they hold up against teething babies. It's my fault that I didn't measure before I bought, so that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.And as for suggestions on securing the teether with zip ties, that seems like it could be something else for the baby to chew on and hurt herself on. I'd prefer not to have to do something like that."
1,Not worth it!,"Teether rail comes in 4 pieces made to fit a standard crib rail. Although it fits on easily, it also can be removed easily by your toddler. My 13 month old has discovered how to remove each piece, chew on it, and proceed to throw it to the floor. Then, he goes on to chew the crib rail anyway. This isn't worth the money -- I would rather pay more for a product that does the job it's supposed to do."
1,crib rail teether review,This was a waste of money. My son took it right off the crib rail and threw them to the ground. Perhaps if we had put it on the crib prior to him chewing the crib he wouldn't have known it was there. We purchased the crib rail teether after he had already chewed along the whole rail. We have another baby on the way so we will put the teether on right away and see if that makes a difference.
1,Terrible,Our toddler pulls each one of the four rail protectors and throws them out of the way so he can chow down on wood and varnish. What a waste of our money. Now we are looking for other options.....perhaps something that stays on the rail!
1,Doesn't stay on,"I should have heeded other reviews about this product. I love this company, and wanted something that wasn't cloth and soaked with flame retardants. The rails do come in 4 pieces and easily are taken off by my 11 month old and tossed on the floor. Then he proceeds to chew on the wood railing anyways."
3,Small nice notebook although dispensable!,"Not very thick! That dates a little, that is not very educational, but forces is me to admit that I throw back to it an eye from time to time regularly to glean some tricks!! Very nice point about the mixture of colors in unissons. It is not very expensive .Small nice notebook although dispensable!"
3,Great starter book for identifying wood,This is a small book in both page size and number of pages. Each type of wood covers 1/2 page and gives allot of information for such a small space. The drawback is it's lack of cross references. Woods are known by many common names so when shopping for wood this book may or may not help out. The one characteristic it lacks is if the wood is on the endangered list or not. Overall a good starter book. Well worth the price in any case.
5,AWESOME!!!,"I Love the audio version of the bible. This is great if you are tired and dont feel like reading, or if it's real late and just play it and fall asleep with God's Word. It's amazing thing to have for people who have bad eye sight, or just dont like to read period. This is a very interesting thing to have!!!"
3,"Good Thesis, but a Difficult Read","The Thesis is important. The idea that the religious beliefs of the Japanese, a mix of Zen, Buddhism, Shinto, and a bit of Confucianism, created a Protestant like Work ethic in Japan. It is intriguing. The Weber thesis of Western Europe and the North American states that the Protestant religion ground in many a pull yourself up by the bootstraps mentality is a good one. Look at the economic and industrial success of majority Protestant countries vs. majority Catholic countries. Bellah carries this type of idea to the Japanese. The vocabulary of this book is tought. It is not an easy read, but it is informative and it is thought provoking."
2,Cans instead of jars as advertised.,"The product was advertised as resealable jars but was actually cans. The slices were mushy/soft. Its difficult to store the product once the cans are opened. The product quality,in general, is poor."
5,Much better than expected!!!!,"Ever since I have been using personal audio players (even way back with tape decks) I have never been satisfied with a case. This is the first case that I am totally happy with. It makes the nano like a pager, but smaller. The case snaps, very tightly (be careful to line up the ipod before snaping closed because it takes some work to get off) around the ipod. Also, it can face up or down. I like it to face down because the headphone jack is upward, and dosen't get caught. The cotrol wheel is the only exposed area, and since it sits in a small ""hole"" is much easier to find the control you are looking for, especilly when running, driving, etc. This case really adds to the functionality of the nano. Much higher quality than expected."
1,Doesn't fit a 2nd Generation nano,"If your iPod has rounded corners (like the one in the image on this page) it should fit without any trouble, but if the corners are squared off, it won't fit."
5,One of the best books on Youth Ministry period.,"Pastor Smith, in his book Raising Up Young Heroes, writes simply one of the best books on cutting edge youth ministry that you can read. Unlike most youth ministries book which are only practical with a specific racial or social group of youth, or simply restates what has already been said, Raising Up Young Heroes shines like a lighthouse on a stormy night. The book takes a holistic approch to youth ministry, in an attempt to change the student from the inside out. This book will help you better minister to a culture that is ever changing.If you are in youth ministry, you need this book!"
5,A Standard for Youth Ministry,This book takes Youth Ministry to a new level and give practical ways for leaders to add new flavor to their own ministries.
3,a good series and a great artist,"this mini series is great to see Neal Adams on Batman again...like now on Batman Odyssey only with Ra's Al Ghul. i can not pay to get the originals so this is the next best thing, i also have the treasury edition of these stories. funny thing though. the pages of issue one were not in order and i had to take it apart and turn the pages every which way to fix it. now i need a stapler. i have been a comic book collector sense the 1960's and this was my Batman stories not the camp humor of the tv show and the book in those years. Denny O'Neal and Neal Adams were a great team."
4,Comentario Sobre la Edicion En Dvd de Un Gancho al Corazon,"Exelente Dvd. Me Encanto el Resumen, Muy Dinamico, Faltan Algunas Escenas Importantes pero Mantiene la Esencia de la Historia y con la ayuda de algunos dialogos se puede entender perfectamente.Me Gusto Mucho la Telenovela, Muy Divertida y Exelente las Actuaciones de todos.La Verdad La Recomiendo, Les Va a Encantar, No Se Van a Arrepentir, se los aseguro."
1,causes ghosting on my 14' lcd monitor,my 14' lcd running at 1024x768 looks terrible after putting in this extension cable. not worth the money. look elsewhere.
3,Garfield for the beginning reader,"Garfield never fails to charm children of all ages. This book is great for the beginning reader. If, however, you are trying to stress the importance of physical fitness, Garfield is a poor example anytime, and especially in this book. But, as long as the child is made to understand that Garfield is just a funny, ( hilarious, really), fictitious cat, and not a role model, then all will enjoy his antics."
1,Does not work on soft cheeses.,"This product advertises that it works on ""all cheese."" I gave the gift and while it was being used for hard cheese it did fine. When mozerella was put in the grater, the handle broke off completely. The handle crank is not fastened to the grating drum very well and the stress of trying to grate soft cheese was just too much. I felt terrible for giving such a poorly made gift."
4,"I love this grater, but...","This grater works really, really well -- until it breaks. Usually the handle on the drum breaks for me, but the latest break was the hinge piece on the handle. It just seems to have disappeared. I wasn't the one using it when that happened -- just saw the result. I keep the working parts, so I can usually make up a new one from them. In spite of this, I like this grater enough that I replace them. I find it easy to use, even on hard cheeses, and the big drum means that it doesn't get clogged. It is somewhat awkward on soft cheeses, like fontina, which I sometimes grate a lot of for mac and cheese, but I just clear it and keep going. It helps to alternate pieces of fontina with something harder/drier like gruyere.I haven't found anything I like better for ease of use/ease of cleanup. I just wish this grater didn't keep breaking on me."
3,Flimsy,"I'm strong, and I'm grating hard cheese, and this thing doesn't really hold up. It's definitely an okay product, well designed and all, but it just needs to be a little tougher. I haven't broken it yet, but it flexes a lot."
3,cheese grater,drums won't lock in place but if you go slow still work okay. if not for the drums slipping off i would recommend this
1,tough to hold,"I should have headed the advice of another reviewer about the size of the grip, especially when turning the handle. The radius of the crank is too large to keep it steady.I would like to return it, but may be too late - I have been away from home since mid May."
2,Unfortunately I have to agree with the negative reviews,"We've gone through many hard cheese graters and we were hoping this would be a good one because of past experience with Zyliss. After a couple of years the parts are breaking off as noted. Even more annoying, its very hard to hold on to and the cheese goes flying as you're grating. Its cute but not very functional.I'm browsing Amazon for a suitable replacement."
2,Eh.,"This was my third rotary grater. The plastic ones seem to break, and I lost my metal one in a move. This particular Zyliss one was by far the least comfortable to use, although it did grate things well and left the smallest ""cheese remainder"" of the three. The handle snapped off after about 6 months of light use."
3,Works fast but OUCH!,Definitely faster than hand grating. Easy to clean. Not bad overall. But the hand that holds the grater (not the one that turns the wheel) will get sore if you have to shred about 2lbs. of cheese. My hand hurt for 5 days.
3,Works BUT...,"Works ""grate"" but after a short time, the aiming funnel will get loose and not stay on the drum. Very disappointed in that feature, which then creates more of a mess than it should be.Other than that flaw, it is a wonderful tool to use."
2,Liked it while it worked,"Mine lasted about a year and was fairly heavily used, but as with previous reviewers, it snapped at the handle. I'm going to try the other Zyliss Amazon currently has for sale:Zyliss Classic Cheese Grater"
4,Good for small jobs.,"I liked using this grater for small amounts of cheese; however, I made the mistake of using it for a large amount of Parmesan the first time I used it and I had a sore thumb for two days from pressing on the hopper. I then revised my operation of the grater and used it to get the small bits remaining after using a box grater. I also added a rubberband to reduce my thumb stress. It disassembles easily and is easy to clean. Overall, I would recommend this grater for small jobs."
2,Hard to use and breaks easily,"I agree with other buyers of this grater that it is difficult to hold on to so that enough pressure is put on the cheese. It works pretty well if you need only a very small amount, but in less than a minute your hand will be aching while you try to hold on to it. The second time I used the small grater, the handle broke off from it. The handle is attached to the drum with plastic, and breaks when trying to grate a harder cheese."
2,Flimsy Crank Handle and Uncomfortable Grip,"This seemed like a good idea when purchased, but it didn't take long to get to dislike it. The pressure needed to grate hard cheese makes it very uncomfortable to use. The crank handle locking mechanism broke shortly after I bought it. I still use it with the handle constantly collapsing and making my knuckles bleed. Avoid this model and get one with a fixed handle."
1,Uncomfortable and easily breaks,"FYI, we generally used ours for hard cheese...1. The grater was slightly uncomfortable for me to hold/use (I have large hands), my wife had a much harder time and commented to me that she didn't like using it due to this.2. The handle is attached with a small piece of plastic to the drum. Within a few weeks, both handles had broken off of the drum. It's now in the trash.I will say it worked well when it worked (for the most part), however, based on the overall design flaws, I wouldn't recommend."
3,Slippery Grater,"This item grates cheese well and I love the funnel, it helps direct the cheese where you want it. What I didn't like about this grater is that it is hard to hold on to. It's made of a very smooth plastic and it is very narrow toward the back. The whole time I was trying to grate cheese my hand was sliding toward the back of the grater, making it hard to keep a firm grip and keep the cheese pressed against the wheel. It says that is has a non-slip grip, but there is only a small spot with rubber where your thumb sits."
4,best of what's around,"I agree that the handle is a little awkward (that's the only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars), but aside from that, this is the best rotary cheese grater I've found in years. It's sturdy (so far so good, I've used it several times with no problems--and it has a 5 yr. warranty...) I like the compact feature. The grating rollers fold up nicely. It's easy to clean, even if you don't put it in the dishwasher. I'm very happy with this grater. At last!"
4,Fun product,"Saw this on a gadget review show on Food TV and thought this would fit my cheese grinding needs. Especially liked the fact I could grind ""soft cheese"" with the coarse drum as we use a lot of cheddar and mozzarella in my house. Bought some block parmesean and used the fine drum and the result was better than I expected!Product cleans well in the dishwasher with some prescrubbing of the drum to remove any smeared on cheese.Only fault I find with the product is figuring out which way the drum fits in - had to remove it and flip it over so I could rotate the wheel more comfortably."
3,So-so,"I bought three rotary graters -- this one, the Progressive International, and the Kitchenaid -- hoping one of them would excel. This one appeared to be the likeliest candidate, being bigger than the others. But apart from general flimsiness, all of them have the Achilles' heel of a too-small, too-short handle; this model, with its handle size constrained by the decision to make it foldable, probably is the worst of the three.Do any of these manufacturers ever try using their products?PS. The Kitchenaid was marginally best. But it ain't that great."
2,"hard to hold, easily broken","I am pleased with the large cheese hopper on this unit, but the handle is bulky which makes it difficult to hold proper pressure on the cheese while turning the crank. Both grating drums broke before the unit was a year old. The plastic piece that holds them in place is too fragile. On the other hand, I like the texture of the grated cheese it produces with both grating drums. I just wish it were easier to use."
2,Boo!,"The handle on the small grater broke off while grating cheese. Unfortunately we were past our 30 day warranty. The bigger grater still works though, so it isn't an entire waste.Additionally, there were no instructions on how to change graters so we had to work it out ourselves.I probably wouldn't recommend this one."
1,This is a terrible tool! Very disappointing,"I bought this when my old 7"" Zyliss grater broke (after 12 years). The old grater had been one of my favorite kitchen tools: no frills, and efficient. I couldn't find the same one ... apparently Zyliss was in the middle of converting to the current ""classic"" model they list as the 11370. So I bought this thing. It's awful! All marketing, no engineering! You can't grip it and apply force to grate the cheese. (Caveat: pro basketball players will have no problem ... normal humans are out of luck) Plus it's twice the diameter it needs to be and fits in drawers awkwardly. Save yourself the headache -- don't buy this thing! Look for an old 7"" Zyliss or buy a different brand."
3,not better than my last one,I had another cheese greater from zyliss that I liked much better the problem was i lost the knob that makes it turn and i can not seem to find a replacement. The new one is okay but i think that i love my first one better
4,So much better than a regular grater.,"Somebody was really thinking when they came up with this. Love it. It reminds me of the thing my mom used to use to grind nuts for baking. It works great. I'll never go back to the traditional type grater. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the handle that you turn to grate the cheese is a little awkward because it's short, but that's a minor thing. And it comes apart so easy for cleaning. Best kitchen product improvement in a while."
4,cheese grater,I like the ease of using this grater and I like having the choice of fine and coarse grating. I didn't find the handle hard to hold or use. The only thing I had a problem with was the handle on the grating drum which doesn't want to stay in place while I'm turning the drum.
3,Zyliss doesn't deliver the zing hoped for,"I've gone through 2 Pampered Chef cheese graters so I thought I'd like to try something new. I ask every Italian waiter I see what brand they use and why they like it. Zyliss was highly recommended. I have to say, I am a little disappointed. It is not as easy to use as the Pampered Chef, though I do like how easy it is to take apart. I have small hands and perhaps that is the problem. I have a hard time getting enough pressure on the handle to grate easily. The knob for turning the grater is really cheap and keeps flopping around. It should lock, but doesn't. I'm sure for bigger hands, this item would be great. I think I'll go back to Pampered Chef."
1,Not recommended,"Poorly made. Handle broke the second time we used it. Whoever ""designed"" the handle had no knowledge of the force needed to grate cheese. Contacted the company and never received a response to our complaint."
4,Very fragile construction,"This was really great while it lasted, but the rotary drum handle connection is far too fragile. Mine broke the third time that I used it. OK - I was clumsy, but it is not apparent how you remove the drum - the handle broke off because I did not fold it back before I pulled the drum out of the holder. I notice that Zyliss will sell you a replacement drum for $7.50 from their website (including shipping). That's why I gave the grater 4 stars - you can get replacement parts. It's a very effective grater for cheese. But it is a pain having to be so careful with it."
5,Well Engineered,"Just tried this once, but this looks like a well engineered grater. My last one was not cheap, but I eventually snapped on the handle. This one is much beefier. As a result, there is less wobble when grating hard cheese. Well worth the price."
2,Hard to turn,"Grates cheese okay, would benefit from a bigger handle. It's hard to turn with the little handle."
2,Does the perfect grater even exist?,"We Googled like fiends trying to find a good grater for hard cheeses like parmesan and romano and this was the best we could find. Boooo. Surely there is a designer out there who can come up with something better than this.As other reviewers have noted, the lever is too short to exert enough turning force and you would need the hands of a stevedore to keep the handles squeezed together.At least it is slightly better than the old Pampered Chef crap that broke a few weeks after we bought it.UPDATE 01/02/08: The unit's drums will no longer stay locked into the handles. I would be willing to pay a higher price if only someone would produce a grater that worked."
5,Zyliss All Cheese Grater,"Very happy with the product. It arrived sooner than expected. Very easy to use and clean up is easy, just take out the drum and put into dishwasher."
5,ZYliss Grater,"Zyliss makes outstanding kitchen tools, we have just about every Zyliss tool in our kitchen, and they are the best."
2,This is NOT a cheese grater.,"I thought I was buying a cheese grater.I really did.You see, when I grate parmesan on my regular upright grater, it makes grated cheese. You know: either a fine powdery substance, or else fine, curly tendrils - depending on which side of the grater I use.My previous rotary grater made the latter kind. It was lovely. It was simple and robust, and it made GRATED cheese.This thing does not. Because this thing is not a grater at all. It is a cheese SHREDDER. It makes cheese exactly like the kind that stores sell as SHREDDED cheese: 3/4 inch long little sticks of cheese.And I don't like shredded cheese. It's too heavy. It's doesn't melt quite so well when you put it on hot pasta.Perhaps you do like your cheese SHREDDED. If so, you MIGHT want to consider this. Especially if you like your cheese SHREDDERS to be enormous, unneccesarily complicated, and overly difficult to clean.But if what you want is a cheese grater, THEN YOU WANT TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
3,It's Just Okay...,"This product does a fine job of grating and shredding cheese, but I really hate to use it! No matter what kind of cheese I'm grating, hard or soft, there always seems to be a ton of hard-to-reach bits stuck to the inside of the grater that make it a pain to clean. My hands are small, but even so, it is also difficult for me to comfortably hold this grater. (Maybe it needs a more ergonomic design with a little more padding?)The one thing I do like about this grater is that the drums may be inserted from either side, allowing both lefties and righties equal use of it."
1,Great...while it lasts,"I purchased this item because I'd used other Zyliss graters in the past and had been happy with the product. This product, at first, performs well. However, the flaw is in that in order to lock the spin handle in place, you have to put pressure on it. Within a very short time, the handle on both drums broke off. VERY disappointed in the quality level."
4,It's GRATE!!!,"My wife said she wanted a grater like this and a mandolin slicer for gifts, and I chose this one for the grater.It works very well for either one of us (I am left-handed), and we will continue to enjoy it."
2,More fragile than I'd like for a cheese grater.,"This grater is very easy to set up and clean, but the design of it makes it inherently fragile and difficult to use. My husband put some hard cheese into it the first time we used it, and immediately snapped the plastic tab-handle off the grating wheel, rendering it useless. Thankfully it comes with two wheels, so we know now to be careful with it.It's also a strain on my arthritic hands to use it for long, which is problematic considering how much cheese a vegetarian household can go through. The way the tab-handle is made, it forces the hands into a very unnatural position to use the grater.Since it can't really handle the hardest cheeses, like Parmigiano-Reggiano, and isn't useful for grating large quantities of cheese, we find we rarely use this grater anymore. I like its concept, and certainly it's one of the better models I've tried, but due to its design flaws I simply can't recommend it very strongly."
1,Basic toaster - hot to the touch,"The top of the toaster gets very hot. You may burn yourself each time you try to get your bread out of the toaster.The lift on the lever is too short of a distance to get your bread out. You need to stick your fingers in to get your bread. And, burn your hands while doing this. Take cautionThe heat dial is only marked with a bump - same metal. Difficult to see the setting. I colored the dot red with nail polish."
2,burns!,"Looks nice, makes good toast, but the pieces don't come very far out of the top. The middle part of the top gets HOT HOT HOT, so you singe your fingers trying to grab your toast, poptart, bagel, whatever. Small things, like specialty breads, are the worst. I'm looking to replace this one because I can't stand burning my fingers anymore."
2,Lobsided,The ball came lobsided in the mail and when i pumped it up it remained lobsided. I guess I should have not ordered a soccer ball through the mail but I didn't think it would be permanenty damaged by the shipping. Both of our faults.
4,Good ball,"The ball is quality training ball, it's not a high level match ball, but for the price, it's obvious that it's not. Now that I do not play in college anymore I use this ball to play in men's leagues in the city. It works great, flies well and has a nice touch on it. Best ball at this price"
4,Lap Slide in C.. sort of...,This is a well produced lesson based DVD for playing lap slide guitar. It is based around a tuning that Steve Dawson uses that is C but neither major or minor. Very flexible but it takes some practice to get your head around it. The songs taught are interesting and cover several different feels. Highly recommended for the intermediate guitar player trying to pick up some Weissenborn skills
4,The Best Introduction to Corbin's Work,"Corbin is one of the foremost interpreters of Iranian, Sufi and Persian gnosticism in the west. This volume is a terrific introduction to his other works as it is a collection of short essays in which he discusses how he grew from being a student of Heidegger to a scholar of Persian mysticism. I would highly encourage those interested in the imaginal realm to begin their quest here and then take on his other works, especially ""Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth"" afterward. More people should know of Corbin's work, but unfortunately its audience is largely limited to students of Islam and Sufism. Highly recommended."
2,great disappointment,"i found this CD a great disappointment, probably at least in part because I have become totally mesmerized and spoiled by two previous CDs of theirs, among the best Hawaiian music i have ever heard -- ""Na Kai'Ewalu"" and ""5""."
1,Very sad experience and costly for me,I received these vitamins in bad shape with the seal broken. I immediately sent an e-mail telling the seller this and never heard anything back from anyone. I threw the vitamins away as I think when the seal is broken on the bottle it is a danger to anyone to take them.
5,Best I've Heard In the Last Year,"In my opinion, this is the best CD I have heard in the last year. Exceptionally creative with amazing variety of styles between songs, yet the feeling that they belong together in a thematic way. The songs with strong topical content are chilling and powerful. I will certainly want to see Patti on tour."
4,Patti showing passion again,This album is not Easter or Horses or even Radio Ethiopia but it is damn good. Not as good as the 70's output but good nonetheless. The songs are not as memorable as her classic material but still exhibit her passion and insight. She would release her album of cover or other artists songs with Twelve a few years after this which is perhaps her best album and does rate with her 70's material. This album showcases Patti Smith returning to form.It is remarkable to see an artist regain their spirit and intensity that spiraled their careers return with the same passion. This album is a must for any Patti Smith enthusiast.
3,For the fans....,"It's good to see Patti Smith releasing the same time as Blondie. There are a ton of bands that have been inspired by them. Some of Patti Smith's records in the past ten years have been uneven affairs. Smith supposedly signed to Columbia on the same day as Arthur Rimbaud's birthday. It's good to see that she has refused to have any new influences. When Smith started, the whole idea of poetry and rock being mixed was sort of novel. Now it seems pretentious and poetry has lacked the power to slow down the world in the way it once did. The first song ""Jubilee"" has all the best qualities of her music past and present, and has that Americana influence that has flavored many records in the past few years. Smith gets political on a few tracks. Music never had the power to change anything. I don't think that it will change anything now either. This is a fine record nonetheless"
2,Not a bad book.,"I am a parent and read this book, I thought it was ok, but thats where it ends. As a parent I buy books that will teach and challenge my children. This book was a Christmas gift. Reading this book I don't see that you could learn anything. Its not going to win any reading awards because there is just not much in the book. I think there is a reason it is selling for under a dollar. Its just not a bad book, but not a good one either."
3,workmanship could be better,"Overall item is absolutely beautiful, but the message parts of the bracelet are not put together with solid rings. Have already had a problem with these rings. Otherwise very pleased."
4,Good buy,I bought this for my four-year old granddaughter who is seldom still. She was so excited about her SpongBob book. She chooses it on her own to play with everytime she visits.
3,Title is Misleading,"I am a veteran MDAC ADO developer. Eventually I will be a veteran ADO.NET developer. When I reach that stage, this book will be an excellent reference. However, there is very little in this book which explains how to actually program against the new ADO.NET object model. In this context, the title of the book 'Programming ADO.NET' is somewhat misleading. 'ADO - The Definitive Reference' would be a better title for this book.If you are looking for a tutorial with sample code in order to get started, this is not the book you are looking for."
2,Incorrect in Genesis,"Dake interpreted most of Creation incorrectly, stating that there were humans in existence before Adam, referred to as pre-adamites. This is unscriptural and untrue. Numerous times in scripture it refers to Adam as being the first human ever. He also says that the there were gaps (or long periods of time) between the first 6 original days that it actually took to create the universe. How clearly obvious does it state ""the morning and the evening were the first day."" Please be careful not to be decieved."
1,Word of Faith Mistakes,I cannot recommend this Bible primarily because it is the Bible that the Word of Faith teachers use to support their false teachings. Word of Faith teachers have twisted Scripure to the hilt. One example would be that Christ was reincarnated into a defiled demoniac which is blasphemy. Secondly they(faith teachers) have stated that God needs our permission to enter the earth realm. The footnotes in this Bible are in support of these statements. I strongly advise against this version.
2,Not as advertised...,"The pinking shears as the photo illustrates, has the item with the standard Ginghem metal protective case for storage; however, the shears were sent in a plastic disposable, sheath - not as advertised. I have ordered MANY Ginghem cutting tools and never received an item in the packaging as sent out by this seller. Love Ginghem products, not happy with being mislead by the seller. Secondly, the timing of the shipment (order, delivery, shipment date) and the packing (manilla, bubble envelope) arrived damaged and torn. The thickness and durability of the outer envelope was not adequate to sustain the weight of the product for the distance, especially using USPS services."
5,Gingher Pinking Shears - sheer quality!,"I bought these Gingher pinking shears for my wife and she is delighted. She showed them off at her quilting class and was the envy of many there. They are superbly engineered and can cut right to the tip, unlike a cheaper pair that she started out with."
4,"Great scissors, but heavy","Bought theses because I have a pair of Gingher fabric shears and absolutely love them. When I got these, I was excited to see how they worked. So I pulled them out of the packaging and went to town. The first thing i noticed was the weight; they're quite heavy and as a result can fatigue your hand of you have a lot of pinking to do. Another warning flag that went up is that the scissors are a bit stiff. This was easily resolved by placing a small amount of mineral oil on the assembly point. Really like these shears for the quality but may still purchase a lighter pair to use for larger projects."
1,the item does not work and is defective,The gingher pinking shear is not complete. the top quarter is missing and the shears will not open. I have written the company and have no reply.... This is not a company that is fit to be in business.. Dave Harris
3,"Cuts like a dream, but way too heavy","Gingher shears are known for their superb ability to cut through fabric and these pinking shears do not disappoint. They glide through tulle, cotton, felt and any other fabric with ease. The cost, however, is the strain on your hand due to their weight. The handles are not well-shaped for long-duration use - they wear grooves into my right hand after just a few minutes of use. The balance results in clean edges, but the shears are *not* ergonomically designed. For me to continuing using them, I'll need to purchase a support glove for my hand that will provide padding at the points where the metal digs into my skin. All-in-all, I would not purchase these again."
3,They are just OK,"they hurt my hand like crazy, it was sore for three days after i used them, they are sharp however,and make a clean cut. i would recommend the ones with the spring back."
4,Works well,"The scissors came just in time for my next project. Great delivery time. Happy with the purchase/quality. As other reviewers have mentioned it is a little hard to use, especially when cutting 2 or more layers. Also it does not come packaged in a metal case, but in plastic."
5,Lights My Path,"Still going after months of use in an outdoor motion detector fixture. It gets triggered every time my two dogs or the cat uses the pet door, and that's pretty frequent. Heavy duty, nothing flimsy about these bulbs. Found a good price on them at amazon, and I'm happy."
2,"Wait for a subbed/letterboxed release of this film, and buy.","First of all, this is a reasonably strong film. Not that you'd know it watching this DVD. If you are lucky enough to find the letterboxed/subtitled video, rent or buy it.Simon Yam puts on a very strong performance as the head of a crime family whom is is forced by circumstance to take a hands on approach to eliminating the competition.By no means a groundbreaker by way of plot, and definately not Yam's finest hour as an actor but it does have some finely choreographed violence, including a noteworthy kendo match in which Yam administers a savage and breathtaking beating to one of his lackeys during a sparring match.A reasonably grimey and aggresive low budget gangster film in its original form, this DVD's production reduces it to a laughable mess at times.-Jason Storm"
3,Good and fast delivery service - but missing tack,"I was very satisfied witht the handling and delivery of the producy by the Brazilian company that was in charge of the shipping.However, when I received the material, one of the tacks I was expecting (in fact that is the only reason I oredered to CD) was missing...It is listed in all Fabio Jr. Web sites that this CD is supposed to include ""Volto ao Comeco (with Citaozinho e Xororo), well... the track is missing. This is not the fault of Musica Brazil, I know.Can somebody give me an advice as to how to get the version of ""Volto ao Comeco"" with Fabio Jr. & X&X; ? Greatly appreciated."
5,Absolutely remarkable,"This album was and is a remarkable achievement, probably far less accesible than most other Crimson works and not one for the new Crimson listener. Most later fans of the band would be hard pressed to believe that Fripp plays only classical guitar on virtually all of side one, some great mellotron work throughout not to mention the wonderful horn and woodwind work on side two. Wonderful early fusion from 1970 especially on side two of the original vinyl 'the lizard suite'. I'm a Crimson fan since the early 70's and have always considered 'larks tongues' their greatest achievement but for some reason still find myself listening to this more than any other of the works. Must have for any prog rock fan."
4,"Mixed, but good.","I think the first few songs are right up there with Crimson's best. An excellent mix of a sort of tinkly art jazz with great melodies and doom-laden mellotron. Not much like the rest of King Crimson, but great stuff in its own right. The last, unnecessarily long, song, though, just doesn't do much for me. Pleasant, but lacking any great melodies or drama, it just kind of wanders along for a while..."
1,Dr. Dobson is too harsh,"I agree with the first commentary in that Dr Dobson advocates physical punishment as an alternative; I vehemently disagree. I DO have a strong-willed, distractible, hyperactive, persistent child. However, she is just as deserving of kindness and respect as I am. If you were a 5-year-old child who adamantly refused to clean up milk you spilled on the kitchen floor; and I was the parent who then spanked you. What are the first thoughts you have? Are you sorry you defied me? Are you thinking of how wrong you were? Or are you thinking of ways to get back at me? Do you think you might lie or blame someone else next time? Try Kathryn Kvols ""Redirecting Children's Behavior"" - it starts from a position of unconditional love - what we are all looking for."
1,"An evil, petty, man with grotesque ideas","By all means, use these methods. Embrace his ideas. (Beat your dog, too, while you're at it.) My 'Christian' parents did. I learned fear - certainly not respect. Haven't spoken to them in 25 years. Good riddance."
1,"This man is an idiot, dont waste your money.",Anyone who beats a 12 pound dog with a belt has some serious issues. This man needs help and needs to quit writing books. Abusing ones children and animals is not the loving way to raise a family. Religious idiots will love the book though and can condemn and hate and beat their children and dogs with the love of god in their hearts. Dobson makes me puke.
1,Repulsive,"We have to do better than this for our children. Controlling and turning your kid into the perfect little, well behaved lemming is going to haunt you until you die. This type of abuse never has a good, long term effect on anyone. Put the paddles and belts down and talk to your kids. They deserve at least that much."
5,"Loving, Non-Violent Parent","As you to the fellow quoting Nietzche and his accusations again Dr. Dobson, EXCUSE ME??!!! I have a 5 year-old, very strong-willed son. My husband and I are both loving, non-violent, Christians. Dr. Dobson and his books are lifesavers. Before condemning a person for their convictions and beliefs, try ""walking a mile in their shoes."" Anyone can quote - try living."
1,Horrified!,"Using physical punishment as a lazy excuse instead of real discipline is absurd! It is NOT discipline, it's abuse."
1,James Dobson on Parenting - Control issues,"Out of curiousity we picked up this book as it was referenced. One of the things that struck me was Dobson relates an encounter with his dog (a dachshund named 'siggie') to illustrate how to maintain/regain control. After reading that, I would not take Mr. Dobson's advice on anything and especially on that involving the gospel, and certainly that of rearing a child. His disgusting display over beating his dog to 'gain the upper hand' and control is simply sick. (Not even one star material except you need it to post a review.)"
5,"Incredibly clear, well written and well illustrated","This book is the clearest and most inspiring book on Shiatsu that I have read; and I have read lots of books on the subject. As a practitioner, it has helped me enormously."
5,"wonderful book, even for non-poetry readers!","While I do not regularly read poetry, I received McGrath's first book ""Capitalism"" as a gift and have been hooked ever since. ""Spring Comes to Chicago"" is my favorite of his three. Mcgrath's descriptions of everyday events in the cocoon of his Chicago apartment in winter are delightful. The Bob Hope Poem provides a forum for McGrath's insightful and often amusing obsevations on everything from People magazine to Darwin to squirrels and gourmet pet food. The Pregancy Triptych is fabulous. I highly recommend this book (even to those who never read poetry)."
3,60's Pop at it's best,"This cmpilation is simply worthwhile for the crystal clear sound on Young Girl - there are so many weak or even poor samples of this song on cheepo compilations.Also, check-out the intreagueing version of S & G's Keep the Customer Satisfied. (Could have a few people puzzled at your next BBQ).Gary Puckett's voice never sounded better!"
3,There's fanservice... but where's the plot?,Definately not as good as the original series and only really worthwhile checking out if you are desperate to see some manga-esque lingerie.
5,Wow,"This movie really wraps up the main series in a way that ill probably watch it again and again until I die. If you havent seen the series, buy the srries before buying this, because doing so will cause you to miss out on a fun and romantic anime."
3,not as good as the show,"I am a huge fan of the series and i must say when i saw the fansubs of Love hina again i was dissapointed. it leaves you hanging just like the series did. and all the fanservice just kind of ruins it. i mean ya it was funny in the show but they pushed it to far for this OVA. if you really want to know what happens in this i suggest the manga, its great and this part of the story is told better and pluss its longer :P."
2,The thing that should not be.,"I loved the first 25 epidodes of Love Hina, but this sequal makes me sick. They completely changed the art style, they introduced the thoroughly confusing and annoying character Kaneko, and worst of all, they turned Kentaro into a good guy. How could they? I refuse to even acknowledge this as Love Hina. As far as I'm concerned, Love Hina stopped after the Christmas Special.Some people say Love Hina is just cheesecake. Fine, but if Love Hina is Cheesecake, Love Hina Again is straight up Hentai. Shinobu's lesbian adventures is episode thirteen of the original series pale in comparison to the blatant homosexuality of this sequal. They say lightning never strikes twice, but not only is this sequal NOT lightning, it's complete crap. Don't watch it, especially not if you liked the original. The Almatty has spoken."
5,My favorite anime ever.,"El-Hazard is a funny, heartwarming comedy about high school students transported to a magical world. It has some nudity, primarily in volume 2, but for the most part it's kept minimal. This is a cool series full of imagination and wonder. I highly recommend it to fans of anime and fantasy."
3,Entertaining novel,"As any other lover of mysteries I sometimes discover a number of books on my overflowing shelves of the author I never read before. Hence I felt compelled to read at least one of quite a few books written by Ms. Greenwood that I possess.This entertaining novel is pretty hard to pin down. It has the flair of the times long gone, but slightly more free spirited and rounchy. The sleuth in question, Ms Phryne Fisher is a rich young women with unconventional life. She has pots of money, two adopted daughters and Chinese lover. Even in wild 1920's she would be considered a hussy. Somehow she is absolutely revered and respected in society. Money helps...The books is deffinitely not my cup of tea, but it was witty and quick read and I am planning to try another of her books in the near future."
1,A reasonably well written Mary Sue piece of fiction.,"Is the only way I can describe this. Every idea presented to Phryne (no matter how brillant) could be improved only with Phyrne's fantasticness. She's everyone's agony aunt and best friend (including her lover's new wife), pretty, modern,. annoyingly perfect and has an disturbing need to have the last word with everyone. She does no wrong unless you count grating on the reader's nerves.Of the characters, there was far too little friction/interaction between them. Everyone seemed to accept what Phryne said and did we ever find out what happened to Phyrne's servants who wanted to leave because of Phryne's beliefs? They just seemed to disappear at the end.And who names their kid Phyrne? Rather normal for the 60's but the 30's?On the positive note.. at least the plotline was decent.Ms Greenwood nice try if this was a first book but this really needs an editor."
3,Nice sound but clunky,"The headphones are kind of large- not sure if I want to go around wearing these in public. There's very little holding the ear cups to the headband (a plastic strip held in with two tiny pegs?); they fell apart on the first day of use. My previous experience with headphones is really almost nil- I've only owned ipod earphones, so the sound on these was impressive to me. I can even hear bass in the background that I never noticed before.Note: The headband isn't covered by warranty."
4,"Close your eyes and relax, Koss has a treat for you!","Music is one of my great passions and with few exceptions, I love most flavors! That said, nothing can compare to the thrill and excitement of a live concert experience. Fortunately with quality speakers and headphones, we get to recreate some of that energy and emotion that brings such pure joy. My latest investment in music was a pair of the New Koss Pro4AAA Titanium Headphones. Joggers beware, these are full size high performance stereo headphones best served in the comfort of your favorite leather recliner. These are really cool headphones that sound fantastic! If you're a real music enthusiast, put a set of these on, close your eyes and relax! The New Koss Pro4AAA Titanium Stereophones get 4 Stars!"
2,They fall apart!,"These headphones sound outstanding, but the headband design has a latent defect which over a short period of time causes the headband support to fall apart. It is held on by a small piece of plastic. Usually Koss designs their product much better. I did get a replacement but the same exact defect reoccurred in the replacement pair.I would recommend the koss pro 4 aa which is built much better over these."
2,Disappointing sound,My first great headphones were professional Koss headphones in the 80s. They've come a long way the wrong way. I have earbuds that produce richer sound than these. They are not worth the money or the bulk.
4,This wonderful Young Life resource is now available to all!,"This is a great resource for new Christians, or old Christians wanting to restart things. I am simple and straightforward manner, Ty walks you through the elements of a quiet time and the basics of the faith. I highly recommend it."
4,Songs from Jerome Kern Songbook,Marharet Whiting is a great singer from my past. Very enjoyable singing voice and selection of songs.
1,The Movie Is Better!!!!,I usually like Stephen King's books but The Dead Zone was lousy. Definitely his worst book!Have never watched the TV show but the movie starring Chris Walken is way better then this terrible book!
4,"Good, but Not the Best","I am a huge fan and admirer of Stephen King and his work. Being a huge fan of the television show, I thought I'd give this book a try. From the beginning of the book, I found the series more interesting. I mean, I enjoyed the book a great deal, but I found that it moved kind of slow in parts that focused on Greg Stillson. Aside from that, I thought the book was a real page turner and a must-read for King fans."
4,Weird,"I am thirteen yeras old and i am an avid Stephen King fan. I have recently read ""the dead zone"" and thought it was really weird and scary about the hockey game and when they all fell through the ice. In the end, evil always backfires ie. when the psychic guy was trying to shoot Greg Stiltskin, he touched him and saw that he would commit suicide when he held up the baby to protect himself from the gun. I really do reccomend this book to everyone because if u are into psychic things etc then this will be brilliant. I really did enjoy this book. From Hannah (UK)"
4,Very good book,"I really enjoyed reading ""The Dead Zone"".It was the first Stephen King book I read.The plot was very interesting,and I enjoyed the characters,they were well drawn.Especially John's parents,Vera and Herb.However,I was annoyed by some of the erors in plot and chronology.All in all,though,it was a great,exciting,entertaining book."
5,A spectacular book,"""The Dead Zone"" is my second favorite novel by Stephen King. It's about a man named Johnny Smith who gets in a car wreck, which leaves him in a coma for five years. In that time, he has lost his job, his girlfriend...but gained the ability of second sight. Whenever he touches someone, he sees there future. The sherrif comes to him for help in catching a serial killer, and one day he shakes hands with a politician at a political rally, and sees the horrible future involving the politician. This is a great book by Stephen King, and it is also the book that introduces the town that King has made real in the minds of his fans, Castle Rock. I definitely recommend this novel, because it is one of the best books by Stephen King, and will not disappoint you."
5,One of my absolute favorites,"Despite being a book of fiction, about a paranormal occurence unlikely to be found in real life, Dead Zone almost made me believe that this was a story about a real person. The main character's description is incredibly rich, and the sympathy that S. King evokes for him makes one yearn for a happy ending. It was one of the very, very few fictional books that ever made me cry. Not only is it an engrossing, thrilling, and a beautifully written drama, but it also asks some interesting moral questions. Dead Zone made me a fan of S. King and though I think some of his other books are even better written, i.e. ""The Eyes of the Dragon,"" ""The Dark Tower,"" it remains my most favorite, still."
4,"good, for king","Stephen King should have stuck with e.s.p. thrillers, because Carrie and The Dead Zone are really his only memorable works.If you hate Stephen King, read this...it will remind you that he can spin a good yarn, or he could before he sold out anyway."
5,The coolest King book!,"This was THE BEST king book I've read & I've read a lot. not many people know about this book, so I started leanding it to my friends, & have to fight for it back! I loved this book!"
3,Dead Zone revew,"The book The Dead Zone was mostly good how ever there were some parts of the story that were a little dry,wordy and didnot help the story. Some patst of the story were kinda hard to falo because I persnly could not ynder stand who was speaking.there also was some valger langwige that as some tims was just unapproate."
3,Gripping Read,"Like all his stuff, I looked forward to reading this and enjoyed it. It's a page turner.Not as scary as IT but still has its good parts. King's got a problem with bloat. I seem to have been able to stomach it more in my youth. Now, I just flip through chapters and STILL know exactly what's gonna happen/what's going on.The whole Sarah love story was a little lame. No real point and it didn't seem like either one of them was better off knowing the other.I don't think I'll read this one again."
5,"another great King book does, he really have bad ones?",A great book with an unbelievable climax. read it now!
1,Went on forever!!,"First I just wanna say that I LOVE Stephen King novels. I think he is a spectacular author and I have read tons of books by him. However, I absolutely HATED this book. Here's why:1. It was way too long. Even for a Stephen King book. I thought it would never freaking end.2. There was no action. Or suspense. Or anything worth reading at all. There were just a bunch of pointless words.3. There wasn't enough psychic-ness for me which is what I thought the book would be mostly about.4. Just plain boring and a waste of time to read.However, I have to admit that the concept of this book is good I just did not have the attention span to read all the boring parts. (Which occupied pretty much the whole book.)If you want to be bored to death, go right ahead and read it. (But actually, don't waste your money.)"
3,It's Okay!,"I like Stephen King and though the Dead Zone is not my favorite of his books it was okay but I didn't find it as fascinating as The Shining, or Salem's Lot!"
3,Good read but not King's best by a long shot,"This is the first book I purchased after buying a Kindle. I was glad to find the reading experience (on the Kindle) was great. Regarding the book: Great writing as usual by the great writer. The details, situations, emotional dissection are excellent but the ending IMHO was plain bad. It is as if King wrote 80% of the book with great gusto, got bored, couldn't figure out what to do with the protagonist (John Smith) and decided to knock him off. The END.WHAT??I agree that every reader has his/her own taste. Mine is tilted towards The stand, Tommy knockers, IT (just to give you an idea of whether your taste matches with mine)Oh BTW, this is not a horror novel so dont buy it if that's what you are looking for."
2,Not a 1st Edition,Like most used book sellers they are completely unaware of how to determine a 1st Edition.This was a Book Club Edition which can be found pretty much anywhere.I gave 2 stars as a got a refund quickly and an apology.
4,The Dead Zone,"I'm in college and needed a Stephen King book to read and review by the end of the semester. I was interested in reading The Dead Zone because I never got to see the TV show or the movie, but was interested in the story. After searching a couple of sites, I stumbled across this one on Amazon for $4.44! Legit! Thinking it was an amazing deal, I purchased it right away. It did take some time to ship to me, but I eventually did get it. Since I have until mid-December to read and write a 2,000 word essay about it, I was in no rush of receiving it. The only thing I wish was different about my purchase was that because it was a hard cover, I do with the original paper sheet covering was shipped with it. But for $4.44, I'm satisfied! If anyone has any good points that they noticed about the story that's hidden under the surface of the words, email me and let me know so I can get an A+ on my essay!"
1,Not a Page Turner!,I have read some Stephen King books that I liked that were real page turners that kept my interest but I didn't like The Dead Zone and didn't find it to be a page turner and it just absolutely failed to keep my interest and I found it a real drag to read and wasn't a book I added to my collection of books that I just had to keep.
3,Definitely not his best.....,"First off, I want all the Stephen King fans to know, that if you haven't read The Shining, Misery, It or The Stand, that you should definitely try those before you spend eight bucks on this novel. The beginning of this book starts off strong, but heading into the last 150 pages, you may feel your eyelids getting heavier, do to so much blah- blah- blah dialogue. This was my first Stephen King novel, and after reading The Dead Zone I hoped that none of King's other novels were like this. However, this book can be, at times, quite entertaining to read when King tells about Johnny's new and somewhat creepy ""abilities"" whenever he touches someone. The climax is quite surprising and I also liked the thorough backround info. about most of the main characters. This isn't Kings best work, but by all means purchase The Dead Zone if this review was helpful to you."
3,"fantastic concept, could have had a more enjoyable ending","first off, i had trouble deciding whether or not to give this 3 or 4 stars. its a slid 3.5 stars. this is a really quick reading book for those who are not too angsty about getting to the ending. Like ""salems lot"" the book is pretty slow for most of the book, but in still a very enjoyable fashion. I have to say i IMMENSLY enjoyed the first 2/3rds of this book. My only gripe is that I would have like the plot thread of the strangler to have continued for longer and not gone off on the political tangent. the characers are great and I think thats why they ended up making a TV show based on the book. it could have gone on for so much longer! if only he would have accepted his gift."
1,Boooooring,"I have read many books, and I am amazed at how boring and pointless Dead Zone is. The book could have been 1/10th the size to tell the story (if there really is a story). Most of the book is written about irrelevant events. For example, King drones on about Johnny teaching some guy to read; it drags and drags and at the end of the day, it is utterly pointless and seriously uninteresting. Most of the book is like this. It is one of the only books I began to skim through because it was so pointless and boring."
2,long developed dissappointing ending,"This is the first Stephen King novel I read. I approached this book expecting a horror/thriller ride, but this book was no where close to what I had expected. The plot takes a disproportionate length of the book to build to the climax. I consantly found my self wondering when the climax would occur. Stephen King may be ""the"" horror writer, however the Dead Zone will dissappoint any reader expecting horror."
2,King has written so many great books This is not one of them,"All King's books I've read have much the same structure: a long boring intro (which goes through 2/3 of the pages...) and an exciting climax, which is in most of the cases worth the reading. Dead Zone's climax follows the same pace of the intro... SLOW pace... Too slow. Besides, you have the impression of having already read something similar elsewhere. The storyline is poor, empty. Interesting early King's books are The Shining, Salem's Lot and Christine..."
3,"Good novel, great story","The psychological thriller aspect of The Dead Zone is great. The concept is great. John Smith as a hero is great, if not tragic. What prevented the book from being great, in my opinion, was the lack of peripheral character development. Too many characters, not enough time, I suppose, which is probably a hazard of the trade. Other than that, however, the storyline was very interesting and thought-provoking, a welcome diversion from King's usual fare of gore-splattered horror (which I'm a sucker for as well). I'd recommend it."
5,What if???,"I read the Dead Zone after Mr. Kings ""On Writing"". I have read a few of his other books but did this more in a textbook study. It was all I could expect. He has a grasp on his genre of writing no one else currently could come close. I learned a lot from his "" On Writing"" and this book as a example of writing with a outline. I will read more because of this example.I know that he is a writer that works from a mind and heart that is one of a kind."
5,Simply one of the best books i've ever read,"I love Stephen King but I'm not a huge horror fan ,I love king because he has great characters that you really care about and empathise with and Johnny smith is one of his best with Nick Andross and Larry Underwood of the Stand a close second and third."
5,One of My Favortite Peterson albums,"My dad bought the LP when it first came out, so I grew up listening to it. Unlike many Oscar Peterson albums, this one has some catchy tunes you can whistle or hum along with the album, such as ""Soulville Samba"" (a Peterson original) and ""Mas Que Nada."" Yeah, the album is short, the packaging lousy and all that, but the performances are terrific. I don't keep this disc in its slipcase anyway. I have a book that holds 40 discs I take from my house to my car, and that's where this one resides. If you like jazz piano and samba/bossa nova, get this album. You won't be disappointed!"
3,what is a doohickey?,"A doohickey is something hard to describe.This book isn't bad, and it isn't great. This book isn't really a crime story. It isn't really a serious book. It isn't particularly funny. It doesn't really have a strong or surprising ending.This book is a doohickey."
5,Very Good,"Very good side dish, easy to make, easy to eat. As others have said, needs a little spice, but other than that they are delicious!"
3,Yum,"These potatoes are good. But i don't know if I'd get them again. The garlic taste to me was off and strong. And I LOVE garlic. Hoping I just got an ""off"" batch."
3,They're just ok,"They are a quick side for the main course but they are not special in anyway. They taste like a plain baked potatoe and thats it. They're ok, I was expecting something that had a little more flavor."
3,Unimpressed,"Omaha Steaks 8 (5.75 oz.) Stuffed Baked Potatoes'''The Stuffed Baked Potatoes were unimpressive andlacking in flavor.I tasted no bacon or chives.However, they do make an attractive addition to ameal."
3,Mashed Taters,Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol. (not Omaha's fault)
2,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to this single expecting more of the infectious dance beat of the original. Instead, all I can do is yawn at these typical trancy and uninspiring Erasurish tunes. ""Electric Blue"" A+, ""Crazy"" single - D. The only reason to pick this up is for the video in my humble opinion."
4,10 inch dutch oven bag,"I got this for my husband as a gift, he likes it He now has a place to put his dutch oven in, it keeps the dirt in"
5,Durable and a perfect fit,Fits the 10-inch Lodge Dutch Oven perfectly. The heavy canvas and strong stitching should last a long time.
4,As always,"This is great. Even though her accent isn't really French compared to other French divas, she is able to evoke emotions with this album by her powerful & melodic voice. My favorite tracks are Aimer jusqu'à l'impossible, Si tu veux mon coeur, Il y a des jours, Changer, Si j'avais le temps.The CD cover isn't pretty at all. This is what I don't like about this album - but ""c'est pas de probleme, je t'adore deja, Tina!"""
5,"An amazing, well written book on true crime",This is the most well written book that I have read. I like how it doesn't go on and on about the horror inflicted. They let you get to know all the people involved and focused on their lives. It lets everyone know that there is hope for the justice system afterall. Kudos to all involved. I will read all that they write. Their writing skills are very refreshing!
3,Great bin - but they can't count.,"I've got one of the blue bins, it looks great just like the picture. It feels really tough, rugged, and no weak points. As I said, a great bin - but I only got one, the problem is the description says 12. One bin is kinda useless, and a pretty rotten deal. I don't know how well these bins stack, but the one I do have is pretty secure on the floor right now.I'm working with Amazon and Shoplet to see if this problem can be worked out.End result, ""oops"" (aka ""unit of measure issue""). They are giving me a refund.I originally understandably rated this at one star .. since they straightened it out I'm give it three stars."
3,Dam,"Quaint, middle school level review of the water works in the Netherlands, with 80 pages of photographs."
1,Paslode 16 gauge cordless finishing gun,Don't know if this nail gun is a good choice. Did not operate out-of-the-box. It is at an authorized repair center.Paslode 902000 16 Gauge Straight Finish Nailer
3,Won't fire all the time,"I have owned 3 of the 16 gauge nailers over a period of 1 1/2 years. Each one I have had problems with firing. I have tried different combinations of depth settings, new fuel cells, short and small nails, but with limited luck. The gun works great when it works however, there is nothing more frustrating than getting ready to put up crown and it won't fire.I have the 18 gauge and the framer which work fantastic each and every time. The 16 gauge, well, not so glowing a review. If it was just one I would say me or the gun, but 3 of them. There is definitely something not right here and the factory will not comment when phoned. Oh well, back to the air hose and compressor it seems."
3,A great Tool--But Unreliable,"My husband loves this tool--so fast, lightweight, and handy for finish carpentry jobs--however after the second or third time he used it, it started acting up and finally just stopped working altogether! This caused him some problems on the job--thank goodness it comes with a one year warranty and there is a repairman not too far away. Maybe he just got a lemon?"
3,Great book for those going into pathology!,"If you are an ordinary medical student like myself this book is too detailed and has everything there is to know about the subject. It is a great book for those who have a basic understanding of pathology, but for those who don't good luck reading it for the first time. Some of the comments(jokes) in the book are also not needed. I believe that ""Basic Pathology"" 6th. edition from the same authors is a lot easier to understand with better and more colorful diagrams."
1,thick but not good,The book is written in a very dense matter and extremely unfriendly to reading but worst of all it has very few histological images so while the description is there you often times do not see it and so you don't learn it.
2,shipment and quality,"shipment is excellent, but...the CD-ROM is not working... I need to replace it ASAP! Whatshould I do?"
4,Robbins basis of pathological disease,"It arrived safe and sound, in good shape. It was sent in a timely manner as stated. All in all a good purchase."
5,the most beautiful book of medical science,"I study medicine, and I read several books of phisiology, anatomy and biochemistry. Many of them are so boring and uninteresting. With this book you feel real desire for reading and learning. The the ilustrations, the diagrams and graphics are wonderful. The text is easy to understand and is very actuallized. It's fascinating to read texts from different and so recognized authors. I'm glad I've done this purchase."
2,Not impressed,"I was expecting great things because of 1) price and 2) Omaha Steaks name. This product did not live up to expectations.Chicken breast size is nice and cooks up well, but the artichoke parmesan oozes out during cooking and makes a mess. Most all of the stuffing oozes out and leaves a bland (and horribly expensive) chicken breast.Omaha Steaks offers the Chicken Cordon Bleu which is better for both the tastebuds and wallet."
5,This book is a must have!,"We just came back from Maui, and this book was a must have. If you want to explore the hidden beauty that Maui has to offer this is the book for you. We especially enjoyed that sights around West Maui and the tips on the road to Hana."
3,Should have done more research.,"I purchased this book not knowing that there have been at least 5 revision. A lot of the info is out dated being the 2nd addition. What info was available came in handy! Gave it 3 stars, only because the Author over exaggerated on descriptions of locations."
1,A letdown,"I didn't find this book to live up to its reviews. It was terribly confusing to follow and so syrupy and wordy and authoritative. It oversells itself and really gives tourists the wrong impression. Maui is seeped in history and some of the best beaches are skipped right over. The trail selection is skimpy as are the directions. My advice, and I spent three months there, is to buy some other book."
1,Hidden Gems,"If you're wanting to find all the touristy spots this is the book to choose. The ""hidden"" waterfalls and trails the authors reveal were mobbed with people. We thought we were going to escape the bustle of Oahu on our 3 day weekend getaway. Whatevas! Next time we'll spend more time at the bookstore researching our options instead of relying only on online book reviews."
1,If you care about Hawai'i,"If you care about Hawai'i, you won't want to invade all our secret places. Now, because so many people have the ""Blue Book"", as Hawai'i Revealed is called, we locals can no longer enjoy the places we used to treasure, because of the hordes of tourists now invading them.Please, think twice about buying this book. If you buy it, and do what the authors tell you to do, you'll be helping to turn our islands into the exact thing you're trying to get away from. Keep Hawai'i as it is."
3,"Lots of Info, Use with Caution","If you've never been to Maui, and want to know virtually every place to go, this will provide you with that information. Once you have that info, the burden is placed on your shoulders to use it wisely. Getting to or playing at many of the spots mentioned involves risk to your body due to flash floods, loose rock, and slipperly trails. Some spots are on, or can only be reach thru, private property.Granted, residents have been visiting these same spots for years. The difference is that it's no longer just a few kids on the weekend, it's hundreds of people every day, many of whom are apt to be litigious. It would seem that the authors have absolved themselves of any responsibility if you end up on the wrong side of nature, the law, or the locals.My suggestion would be to stick with the Moon Publications book."
4,Great guide,"We have used this book the last three times we went to Maui. We have always found it a great guide. We have liked the recommended restaurants and sites. We used it for dining, site seeing and excursions. I would definitely recommend it to others."
1,Content Please,My biggest complaint is the way the book is organized and its terrible directions. The writing style is tongue-in-cheek and all the places they describe contain carloads of tourists thinking they've reached some secret destination. This book is a very bad portrayal of a truly wonderous place.
1,Road to Hana,"We were sorry we used this book for our roadtrip to Hana. It missed so many of the good places we later found out about. It also fell short when it came to seeing the coastal area around Kaupo which to us was the most pristine of all, virtually free of tourists. Also there were very few places to take our children. Basically, there's not enough content and way too much space loaded with opinions."
5,Greatest book for Maui!!!,"This is the greatest travel book you can ever find for Maui. My husband and I went there for our honeymoon and it couldn't have been as fun as it was if we didn't have this book. The book describes every detail to get to the most wonderful spots. Our stay consisted of spending a lot of time in Hana, Maui. We wouldn't have been able to find the hidden spots on our drive there if this book didn't describe it to the mile."
5,We're calling it the Bible,"Just back on the mainland and still in awe at how essential we found this guidebook. It seems that no matter what you want out of your Maui visit, this one will help you make the best of it. We met other travelers who were also referencing it and called it their Bible for touring the island. Well done, Andrew and Harriett!"
4,best of the books,"Just came back from a trip to Maui with 5 friends. We each had guide books from Lonely Planet, Rough Guide, etc., but one person's Maui Revealed was the book we all ended up using. Every time we wanted to do something -- whale watching, surf lessons, a luau, etc. -- Maui Revealed had an opinion on the easiest and best way to do it, and it often seemed to be right.Rather than just listing phone numbers and names, Maui Revealed offered opinions, which was rare in the genre and incredibly valuable.Would be five stars except the directions were often pretty vague. Not clear why, but we occasionally found ourselves lost when following the book's descriptions of where to find certain beaches, hikes, waterfalls, etc. Didn't dampen our enthusiasm for the book, but did prove occasionally frustrating."
3,Sarh sings for the man,Sarah's voice quality is the best. I get the feeling here that the material was what the record company wanted and not the kind of material she was passionate about.
4,Great Sound! Great Voice!,"I've heard Ella, Billie and Sarah and although I like them all, I personally think Sarah is the best. Her vocal range is incredible and the full-bodied delivery is just sublime. I could never grow tired of listening to Sarah. Although the product description doesn't say so, the version I have may be different from what's advertised here as mine was made in the EU but comes in a very nice mini-lp replica sleeve and is very well remastered too. You may want to check with Amazon first to confirm which version this is unless it doesn't bother you as I've had the bad experience of receiving discs that are totally different to the descriptions that they provided in their product description section a few times already. The track selections all have a ""man"" theme but help to showcase her brilliant vocal faculties. Highly recommended for all jazz diva fans."
2,Cheap Materials - Good Design,"The design of the case is correct. The straps distribute the weight evenly. I purchased this cover primarily to protect from dinging other items as I pack to go camping. There is zero effective padding on this case. The bottom is padded a little bit. Nothing around the edges or top. The workmanship is good, but the real problem is the lack of padding materials and the thin nylon is cheap. I feel ripped off that I paid so much for cheap materials. I won't return it, but for the money, this should be a lot better."
4,Nice Bag for your Dutch Oven,Great no-frills way to store and carry your expensive dutch oven.Seems well worth the price.
5,Love it!!!,Have these totes for all three of our dutch ovens and wouldn't use anything else. We camp a lot so our dutch ovens are constantly on the go. Used them all summer and haven't had a single problem. Feels sturdy and don't anticipate the handle breaking.
5,A Classic,"This book is one of my favorites, and has been for many years. Its beautiful color illustrations are grouped by the period and country in which they were created. The book presents works (mostly paintings) from many countries (mostly Western) beginning in the Byzantine era, extending up until the early twentieth century. Many of the works are accompanied by art historical abstracts which offer insight for both the inexperienced and learned art enthusiast. This is a great book to have around as an extensive survey of Western painting."
4,excellent,"This album to this day gets a bad rap with fans of King Crimson. Beat was meligned on release, accused of being a commercial album.It is true that ""Heartbeat"" is a love ballad, one of the few in the Crimson catolouge. It is also true that Beat's production is more polished than any King Crimson album before it.But even Fripp's beautful solo on ""Heartbeat"" would have been enough to keep the track off mainstream radio. This song, and ""Neil And Jack and Me,"" are probably the only two tracks APPROACHING pop--maybe somewhere five block away.Listen to ""Nuroticia"" and you'll here Crimson inventing all kinds of ways to create chaos with their guitars. ""The Howler"" is perfect dissonent art rock.If this band was ever sold out, show me where, becuase it is not on Beat."
5,My favorite King Crimson album,"Yup, this one's my favorite. Lots of people like Discipline better, can't blame 'em, and lots like the earlier stuff. But this one does it for me. Neal And Jack And Me is just a great driving song. Adrian Belew is in top form and the band cooks. The rest of the album's just as good. Some folks say this record is too pop sounding. I've never heard that- it's still about as far away from radio fodder as electric music gets, but it does seem to have a bit more accessible-to-the-masses sound than some of their other efforts. How is that bad? I don't love every King Crimson disc ever made, but I like quite a few of them. Still, this is the one I'm likely to put on first. If you don't listen to a whole lot of avant garde rock type music, and want to see what the big deal is, this is a pretty good place to start. I'd also recommend Discipline and Red."
3,a patchy effort,"there are some fine moments, but some ordinary ones too. the weakest of the Discipline/Beat/Three of a Perfect Pair trio"
2,Not as good as Discipline,"The album starts strong with the first three songs, but it soon turns into a strange mixture of sounds goin' nowhere. Very far behing ""Discipline"" in my mind"
2,Beaten back,"2 1/2Easily falling into the integrity-laced group's worst recordings, Beat exemplifies the progressive searchers acclimating to an eighties, pop-inflected aesthetic."
3,Seven Deadly Sins,I liked the over all concept except there were lots of things like disease and pregnancy that were not included as consequences for some of the sins.
4,"Good for a Beginner book, covers the basics","Gives a good history and background on herbs, and their use. Has a small recipes section, with some basic recipes which can be tailored to suit specific needs. I'd recommend this for anyone interested in using herbs to heal that is at beginner level. It's a short and easy read, a good handbook to have around."
3,"Good, Not Great","I've owned the LP for a very long time. While the music on this album comes very close to being overproduced, two songs stand out - ""The Shadow of Your Smile"" and ""Non-Stop to Brazil."" Other decent cuts include ""Aruanda, Fly Me to the Moon, and The Gentle Rain."" If I weren't an Astrud Gilberto fan, I probably wouldn't have bought the CD, but still..."
5,Very Stylish,"I ordered 1/2 a size larger than what I normally wear, they are very comfortable, but I could have ordered them in my normal size. Very nice looking."
2,VERY BORING AT TIMES,"A HALF INDIAN HORSE BREEDER [THE LATE GREAT CHARLES BRONSON] FALLS IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN [BRONSON'S DECEASED FORMER WIFE JILL IRELAND]. WHEN HER RACIST BROTHER FINDS OUT ABOUT IT, HE GETS ANGRY AND DECIDES TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THIS WESTERN IS SIMPLY TOO SLOW MOVING AND TOO BORING AT TIMES. BRONSON'S DECENT PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE IS THE ONLY THING SAVING THIS ONE. IT'S SIMPLY A WESTERN THAT TRYED TO BE TOO MUCH MORE THAN WHAT IT IS. BRONSON FANS DESERVE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. IF YOU WANNA SEE A GOOD CHARLES BRONSON WESTERN, RENT OR BUY ''ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST''."
1,Simply lousy...,"I hate to see the rating on this film misrepresented so I have to rate it. Aside from the lousy picture and sound, the movie stinks. Hard to believe both John Sturges and Charles Bronson were involved in this schlup, if that's even a word..."
1,Yuck!,"This is a spaghetti western with no sauce in it. Normally a western with Bronson and directed by Sturges would have been something to wet one's appetite. It is not so here. The movie is dry and the pace is so slow. The production value is cheap. Despite the presence of an internationally popular star at that time, Bronson just could not carry this one. It amazes me that the director associated with films like The Magnificent Seven and The Gunfight at the OK Corral could come up with something bad as this one. But the trend was already there when he directed Joe Kidd with Clint Eastwood. That was bad. This was worse. The DVD picture is bad and hazy. It seems that this was taken from an old and badly copied VHS and transferred to DVD. Shades of the old MC Clintok DVD from Goodtime Video. Don't waste your money on this one. This is Bronson's worst movie."
1,beautiful but defective,the bracelet is gorgeous but it will not stay clasped no matter what i do i will return it.
3,"gadol needs a plot, not a soliloquy, to drive the narrative","Gadol is wonderful at plots but here he aims at a Brahmsian autumnal perspective that moves neither the characters nor the sense of time passing. The metaphor of house construction (renewal from chaos) is too disjointed and the sense of 'completion' (safe from the elements) too distant from the self-absorbed lives of the three protaganists. (They all confront 'loss') Gadol writes the book like a play, but the absence of threat and external horror (other than the weather and iits punishing unpredictability)lessens the tension of the 3 linked lives. The heterosexual love sequence is ludicrous - the 2 male leads (who are strangely unaware of each other's physicality) connect not at all. Gadol is a wonderful, inventive writer when he has a plot to drive - here the plot is reflection and hot Californian sun, and the book gets lost in the heat."
5,The Jazz Singer's Singer,"I saw Etta Jones live in Harrisburg at the St. Moritz in--was it 1992? Her performance with Houston Person and his band was incredible. She was one with her audience as she sang a variety of tunes from throughout the century.Since then, I've been a consummate Etta Jones fan and have collected everything by her I can find, from her early career with big bands in the 40s through this excellent posthumous release, which features selections from CDs released during her most recent years. This is an awesome collection that is a 'must have' for anyone beginning to collect her music. She is a singer's singer, highly respected in her field, but never having the popularity of some of her peers. Her delivery may remind you of Billie Holiday but her style cannot be replicated. She is the inimitable Miss Jones."
2,Dissapointing,"I have read and enjoyed dozens of titles in the 'Very Short Introduction' series however this one was a disappointment. As pointed out in a previous review, the book lacks a coherent flow and jumps between time periods in a confusing manner. Many important figures and events are not properly introduced or placed into context and a great deal of prior knowledge is assumed. This book may be helpful for someone who already has some knowledge of Russian history however I would not recommend it to anyone seeking a 'short introduction' to the subject."
2,Haphazard and un-organized,To understand the history and complexity of the Russian Revolution requires a book of over a 1000 pages. This brief essay does no justice to the topic. I find that Stephan does not have a flow of both thought and prose. There really is no continuity in his writing; throughout the book he jumps back and forth in timeline. It does get very confusing and frustrating to follow. I personally didn't learn anything new; than what I already knew about the subject. So I was really not pleased with this book.
3,Didn't fit.,This did not fit my car as it listed. The power plug was a different size and shape to my car. I could only get one motion - either up and down or left and right.I gave 3 stars because I not sure if it was the mirror or the car which was the problem.
4,"Looks great, not completely sold on how it fits...","Product is well made and looks pretty much identical to the original. However, there is a little bit of a gap between it and the car when attached. I tried attaching it twice...there's just not much of a ""snug"" fit."
3,WHY DIDN'T THEY TUNE THE PIANO??????,"I absolutely LOVE Brubeck and Desmond, but this record leaves a LOT to be desired. While the playing is pretty great, as you'd expect, the fact that the piano wasn't tuned for the studio cuts is unforgivable. The way Desmond's sax was miked makes him sound way too ""airy"" and leaky, like his embouchure was disintegrating, which I'm sure it wasn't! The live recording on board the Rotterdam is superior to the studio tracks, and both Paul and Dave are truly in their element on this last song, with Dave REALLY hitting his stride, in his own inimitable way, but this one track doesn't make up for the rest."
3,scholarly doesn't have to be boring.,"Thankfully I got mine used. This translation is good for academics writing a thesis on the subject. To the layman it is completely unreadable. I've read plenty of dry historical texts in my time, and this one ranks up there with the dryest. Much of the book is reference material, also unreadable. Elitists scorn translations written so people can actually understand them, but for my money (a new or even used copy of this book here is, for a paperback, rediculously expensive), I'll take a translation where my eyes don't glaze over every other paragraph. Yawn."
3,"Kenso - Recording Is Horrible, Material Good","Kenso is a smoking all instrumental fusion prog rock outfit from Japan who have been around for more than a decade now. Led by guitarist extraordinaire Yoshihisa Shimizu the band has become one of the leading exports from Japan in the progressive rock world of late. I own three of the band's albums and I think this one is the weakest of them. One thing that I find very annoying is the recording itself is pretty bad. The album sounds like it was recorded in a tin can, and although I can usually overlook things like this, on ""Esoptron"" I find it particularly annoying. The material is all good to great, but I really enjoy the heavier approach that the band would move towards on more recent discs. This album is ok, but I think you would do better checking out either ""Yume No Oka"" or especially ""Fabulis Mirabilibus De Bombycosi Scriptis"" first."
1,This CD is a MAJOR dissapointment,"When I ordered this CD, I expected the usual immaculate playing and production from this band (I have all their other CDs, and I recently saw them at Progfest 2000). Unfortunately, what this CD consists of is terrible compositions (except for maybe 1 or 2 tunes... the opening track is absolute garbage) that sound like they were recorded in mud (or someone's garage). This ranks right up there with Genesis's ABACAB as one of the biggest musical dissapointments of my life."
4,Asking for Trouble,"Sophy's sister, Belinda, is getting married, and as expected, Sophy receives an invitation for her and her boyfriend, Dominic to attend the wedding...one problem; Dominic doesn't exist. Sophy has made him up to get her mother off her back, but now needs to produce him for the wedding. Out of sheer desperation, she hires Josh Carmichael from an escort service to be her wedding date. Can Sophy keep her lies straight, and her hands off the attractive Josh, or will disaster befall her?This is a cute, quick read. Sophy is a little whiny and her way of speaking is annoying, but overall I enjoyed the novel and the connections between the characters. Great for the beach!"
3,asking for trouble,very slow reading unless your english and know the slang. I found it not very funny at all and would not recommend this book if your looking for an up lifting read. Love Amazon though and the way everything was handled but the book I found boring.
2,Disappointing read,This is the first time that I think the movie was better than the book. That is disappointing to say since the book usually have more details.
2,A chore to read,"I beg to differ with the majority of reviewers here. I found this novel to be a chore to read. Unoriginal plot, witless dialogue, boring characters, predictable outcome -- I can name several more flaws that made this book such a bore. There are some cute moments in the story, but not enough to make it interesting. The heroine often wondered if hiring an escort to pass as an ex-boyfriend of hers at her sister's wedding made her desperate. I think we all know the answer to that! I do not want to discourage others from reading this book -- after all, just because I found it boring doesn't mean others will..."
1,Throughly unlikeable heroine,"I agree with one reviewer when she recognized right off that she didn't like the female lead. I thought she was nasty, didn't have a sense of humor and another thing, why would Josh like her? She completely spent most of the first part of the book whinning about not having someone to take to the wedding, then the second half of the book whinning about taking Josh. Somehow I feel sorry for Josh's kids if he were to marry the whinning heroine of this book. I skipped through most of the second half and read the end. Don't waste the time or money on this book. Also have read this author's first book, and felt the same. Gave this a second chance because the story sounded fun...it wasn't...what a shame."
