4,eating 15 worms,"The book is not great but not bad. The main characters are Billy Joe, Alan and Tom. My favourite of course is Billy the one that eats all the worms. On my point of view you should read it. Thomas rockwell used are lot of imagination and I like that."

3,How to Eat Fried worms,I liked How to Eat Fried Worms because it's funny and disgusting. Fried Worms is disgusting because Billy eats worms.
3,Terrible Worms,"I thought the book was terrible, I hate the part Billy ate the 5th worm and got sick. In some parts of the book it was funny and werid. I think the book is good for 10,11 and 12 year olds."
3,it was an ok book but it wasn't all that entertaining,I liked the book because I thought that that it was cool for a kid to be eating worms but I would never be caught eating any worms.I think that this would be a nice book for 6th and 7th graders
3,How to Eat Fried Worms,How to Eat Fried WormsBy: Thomas RockwellThis is a good book. I really hate reading but this book is funny. I have read the book about 2 times. People who like to laugh a lot will like this book. I never laugh out loud but I did on this book. It is about a boy named Bill and he wants a mini-bike he is dared to eat 15 worms in 15 days for $500 dollars. I like this book because it has a lot of ups and downs.
3,How To Eat Fried Worms,How To Eat Fried Worms is a very funny book.Its about three boysthat are so mean because they want another boy to eat 15 worms in 15 days but the boy doesn't want to eat the worms because he must get sick. The problem is that he doesn't want to eat thoes big and nasty worms. The boys where trying to force him to eat the worms. I will recomend this book to any kinds of ages.
2,How to eat fried worms,How to eat fried worms is a boring book. I give it two stars. The three stars i give it are for the amount of time that it took him to wright it.
3,Rare case when movie is better than the book?,"""How To Eat Fried Worms"" is a silly book about friends that dare each other to eat worms. Worms, like farts or buggers (the other silly book favorites) do have a certain grossness factor, so I can see the attraction of a book about kids who dare each other to eat worms. The simple language along with the high concept (WORMS) makes this a good book for younger kids, however, the book doesn't have much substance other than the worm-eating shenanigans. I found in this rare instance the movie was better than the book. The grossness factor of the movie kids eating worms will be hard to top."
2,How To Eat Fried Worms,"This is a book about four boys. Their names are Billy, Tom, Alan and Joe. They want to know what worms taste like. Billy is a dare devil. I didn't really like this book."
2,Not much to it,"How To Eat Fried Worms has an entertaining premise -- a bet that a boy can't eat 15 worms in 15 days. However, the characters are paper-thin, the chronology can be confusing (is it an hour later or a day later, one asks at the beginning of many chapters), and the plot is predictable."
4,How to eat fried worms.,"How to eat fried worms. I reckon that this book is very good but it's sound a little bit discussing. The book is about a boy who is dared to eat 15 worms over 15 days for 50 dollars, if he wins he is going to get a mine bike with the 50 dollars. One of his friends dared him to do this, and the other dare that he have to do is to wear all his winter cloths in 98 degrees Celsius and it was very hot. This is a good book and I hope you get a chance to read it."
2,Tianas How To Eat Fried Worms (10th),How to eat fried worms is great. I love it and I think it is a good book for my age and younger. By the way Im 10 years old and I reckon that people over my age would also like it because it is an excellent and wonderful book. Some parts for me sound a bit grotty but other than that it`s a great book and I love it and I hope that other people would read it and like it to.
5,Good book,It was a good book and fulfill its pourpose I will keep using amazon for my purchases its a great website

4,Other Books,"Very amusing gross out type kids tale. It taught me what horseradish was, at least! Quite old, but you didn't really notice, that, as it was about the kids and the whacky bet that two of them have made about how many ways you can eat those little crawling and wriggling earthworms. So pretty entertaining."
3,how to eat fried worms,How to eat fried worms is ok but I don't really like it that much. Because that I couldn't keep up that much. It's also pretty gross. I give it three stars.
3,... Book reveiw,I didn't like it that much because it made me feel sick but besides that I think it was really funny.I think lots of people will enjoy it.
3,Emma's Review,I think that this book is a great book because it is gross because they dared each other to eat worms on the other hand it's a great book because it's intresting and funny.
2,Eating fried worms.,How to eat fried worms has some good parts when Thomas Rockwell used his imagination but after a while you start to get confused.His characters make you laugh and make you want more.It's worth considering and I think you will like it.
3,how to eat night crawlers,Well it is good or you could say all right. I like Billy because he eat all the worms and he won't give up. Alin and joe are determined to make him stop eating worms because they can't get $50 to give to Billy.
3,teacher review,This book was not of high interest to my class of English Language Learners (levels 3 and 4). I do not recommend it.
2,How to Eat Fried Worms - not very good quality!,"I bought this book for my classroom. The VERY first time a child read it, the pictures in the middle started tearing out. Very disappointing!"
2,I don't like the book like i thought i would!,"The book was ok but joe like to eat worms. However,his dad sad he like worms because he liked the taste!"
3,How To Eat Fried Worms,"I am enrolled in a children's literature class at West Virginia State College. How To Eat Fried Worms is a book listed on a banned book list I have reviewed for an assignment in this class. Although it is a banned book, I really enjoyed it. I got so involved in it early one afternoon I didn't put it down all day. I actually caught myself laughing out loud. I do agree that it should probably be on this banned list because of the beverage that is consumed by Billy's father at the end of the book. This is probably not something a child should read in school. Another thing that the book has a lot of are characters lying to get out of trouble. This is also something that children should not read about in school."
3,Imperial Japanese Navy???,"Can someone enlighten me concerning the title of Chapter 23, to wit,""Admirals Nagumo and Kusaka on the Bridge of the Akaiga, December 6, 1941""What can that chapter heading possibly have to do with the book's story line? I asked a person who had enjoyed HTEFW as a child, and received a blank stare.Thanks"
1,THIS BOOK HAD NO PLOT!,"I had to read this book in fifth grade with my class. Honesty, who want to read a book in which every chapter he describes what he put on the worms that he ate???? Certainly not someone who's stomache lurches at the mention of mustard and pepper on a fried worm!!!!!!!!!"
1,Thomas Rockwell should pay for therapy,"In fourth grade we were read this book by our teacher, after lunch (!) for about 2 weeks. I really think this had everything to do with my now phobia of worms, which sounds stupid and a little crazy but believe me not a mild problem when it rains. Thanks, Thomas Rockwell and Miss Maroon, the nightmares continue!(I gave it one star reluctantly because the review wouldn't post with no stars selected)"
4,Awesome Book,My 4th grade students had a great time reading this book in their literature circle groups. All students at the elementary level should read this book. It can also be used for a great compare and contrast activity after you have read the book and then watched the movie. It is a classic for sure!
4,Awesome and funny,Great book to listen to while on a car ride the kids loved it. We laughed so hard at some of the things they did during the story. Made our car trip fly!
3,HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS,"How to eat fried worms is a good book. If you want a book with imagination and good use of language then this is the book for you. It's about a boy named Billy who takes on a bet to eat 15 worms over 15 days. If he suceeds he wins $50,with this money(if he wins) he will buy a minibike. I don't know of any other books that he has written,but by this book I think he is a good author."
4,Great concept but not covered to the full potential,"The author's idea of Low Risk and High Reward (LRHR) and it's potential application is great. Some aspects of minimizing risks while keeping the up-side potential are covered and the best chapter is certainly 'Managing Risk'. Still, the book lacks depth and more material on the subject. And of course, this concept only works for scalable businesses. The book is much more general that the title implies which is in itself ok, just that i expected much more on the LRHR concept."
2,Not that applicable to all businesses,"I operate a health store and have been in other businesses as well i ncluding a major franchise which I did very well with, ran successfully for several years and then moved into the health and wellness industry.Maybe it's because I already have lot's of experience but I didn't really get any value from this book. Someone at the store recommended it today and I decided to check it out at our local library. WASN'T IMPRESSED IN THE LEAST.For the businesses that I have been in, it does not apply at all. It might be good for say self publishers or internet people."
3,I'd pass --- not that good,"I really don't underatnd the 5 star ratings and raving reviews. I didn't see anything good inthis book. In fact it is the first book that I bought and threw away.The low rating here at Amazon (not even in the top 300,000) should be a clue."
4,Not bad,The book does offer some insights that you will not find anywhere else. Worth a read even if you just borrow it form the library.
5,Finally!Real ideas we can use.,"Reiss' book gives ideas you can use obviously gleaned from his personal experiences ""where the rubber meets the road.""My sons are buying my business and I've given them the book as assigned reading; particularly the chapter""Numeracy"".I personally used his ideas from the chapter ""Building the Company"" about how to get free publicity instead of paying for advertising. I'm building a condo project and received 8 newspaper articles, with photos- some front page- in three different newspapers! The articles generated 16 inquiries and 1 sale so far.Bob's 16 common attributes of entrepreneurs in Chapter 1 are fascinating. I teach literacy to a foreigner who is keenly interested in business and I used this chapter with him.If you own a business, want to or deal with entrepreneurs, get this book and study it!"
3,Frivolous Fun from Andrew Oldham,"This CD memorializes one of the many self-indulgent exercises by Andrew Loog Oldham during the all-too-brief Immediate Records era. This album consists of ersatz chamber orchestra versions of current pop songs. Production is credited to Keith Richards, but it is much more likely that Keith gamely permitted Andrew to slap his name on this fun but unlikely release. Arrangements are more likely to be the work of David Whittaker or Art Greenslade.How about a pseudo-baroque version of ""I Got You Babe?"" Mr. Jagger makes a brief and very incongruous appearance on ""I've Been Loving You Too Long."" As expected, Jagger/Richard tunes dominate.Have a laugh on your friends. Buy this and put it on for background music during your next dinner party."
2,not suggest this brand,"i bought this only because i thought the pattern is cute. this is not a very good product. stroller hard to open, kinda big, when you try to put it in the trunk, the handle bar sometimes gives it a hard time. my baby seems to start hating the car seat since he was 6 months old and the strips are complicated.VERY BAD cumstomer service. compared with other baby brands we used so far,this is the worst,very cheap,never replace your broken part for free. we will never try GRACO anymore."
3,there is one big issue,"Ok so here is the one big problem with this product...the car seat does not fit on any of the carts I tried it on including, Wal-Mart, Target, K-Mart, Babies R Us, Shop Rite, Acme..and several others! It does not click onto the cart and can easily slide off....it is VERY INCONVENIENT!"
1,Won't fold,I just thought this was the cutest stroller. Not much available for little girls.Well this is the hardest stroller to fold I have ever tried! We won't be keeping this.Cute without function is just no good.
2,Fulfilling the recording contract with himself,"This album is not as Joe Sixpack has noted in his review. Perhaps too many sixpacks have clouded his judgemnt. This album at best is a commercial flop and is nowhere near some of Prine's other work. This work cannot and does not rise to the level of Sam Stone, Christmas in Prison or the funny ditty ""Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian"". Prine has had numerous other albums that deserve Grammy recognition but I'm sorry to say this is the weakest link in all his work. I wish him well in his sales of this piece of work but I'm not impressed. He is too good of a talent and entertainer to let this stand as a representative of his music. He really should withdraw this album from the public and redo it with better stuff. I expected more."
5,perfect for the rainy season,"light weight, dries quickly, blocks sun and mosquitoes... perfect for our medical team visit to Panama during the rainy season"
4,Columbia Bonehead Shirt,"These are great shirts. Comfortable to wear, easy to wash and durable. They also have a good rating as far as UV protection is concerned."
3,It's OK but I won't buy another one,"Sleeves shortened up after one washing, though I like all the pockets. I plan to switch to Patagonia's products in the future."
5,Awesome shirt,A great shirt at a cheap price. It is the same quality shirt that you could buy at any other website but for half the price. By far the best deal around
5,Excelente!!!,"El significado de tener Columbia es calidad y excelente confección... Deportivo, casual y elegante, todo en una sola camisa... 100% satisfecho"
5,Excelente,"Simplemente excelente producto y funcional. Muy bueno sinceramente, cumplió todas mis expectativas y funciona perfectamente. Totalmente recomendable para todas las personas. Muchas gracias"
5,"Columbia Men's Bonehead Long Sleeve Shirt,SAGE,Medium","Very good product, top quality fabric and design, the presence in these shirts in my country is highlighted recommend it. Thank you."
2,Sizing,"Ordered a ""medium"" for my 15 year old son and found it to be ridiculously large. I normally purchase ""large"" shirts for myself, but this was even comically big on me."
2,OTHER MATERIAL IS,IN THE SAME YEAR TWO SHIRTS PEDI DIFERFENTES EQUAL SIZE AND THE LAST CAME WITH OTHER FABRIC WHICH I DO NOT LIKE
5,"Columbia Men's Bonehead Long Sleeve Shirt, Bright Peach, Medium","Excelente marca. Recibi en muy buen estado. Estoy CONFORME con el mismo, estoy a la espera de la nueva coleccion de la marca para comprar mas y continuar recomendando a mis familiares y amigos."
5,Columbia Bonehead Shirt,This shirt looks good and is very confortable to wear. I have several and always get compliments on how they look.
3,okay,"The shirt is great, but the sizes are too big. I bought a medium and its actually a large. It was a gift for my father and I had to give it to my grandfather because it was too big for my dad."
3,Quality a Little Short,Received this shirt promptly and ordered because liking a previous shirt in a different color. The QC was lacking in that a button came off coming out of the packing. Not what I expected from Columbia.
3,part of a costume,"I purchased this to complete a costume for halloween. But with a storm that came through the weekend prior, Halloween was cancelled so I returned the shirt."
2,LARGE.,"too big, not served to my husband, is very high and needed to buy a large for his long arms but stayed his shirt as a blanket to wrap. the size L is for their arms, if they want to buy a pidanla two sizes of the original. : ("
4,"Great shirt, although bigger than normal","I bought two of this for my boyfriend and he was really please about the fabric and design, the only thing that we found it might be a problem is that the size is bigger than usually, for example he always use Medium and in this one he must use Small.So, if you're gonna buy one, I would say that you should buy a size smaller that you usually use."
4,ecxelet,"el producto como tal es muy bueno, el problema lo presento fue con el envió que amazon tiene que estar mas pendiente de los números de MUN para la dirección, pues se equivocaron y llego a otro casillero y gracias a dios el propietario fue amable y no se quedo con mi articulo."
5,Great gift for a fisherman.,This was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law and he was very happy with it. He already had one and had asked for another.
3,Too big,"Instead that I bought this item as a S size, this shirt was too big for me. I had to give it to another person. About the quality, Columbia is Columbia. It is a very good shirt."
2,Yrua Octavio,Good friend I am of venezuela. I write to him because I did to him a purchase of two shirts Columbias it pinches long colors white and sage. You me sending a mail saying that already they were sent but it did not give to me the number of sending. I am translating since I do not speak Englishman. I wait for his prompt response porfavor.
4,"A sensational singer, songwriter and arranger","Although only 9 tracks, they are all real class, there is plenty of variety.For a sample of the best that music can offer check this cd out."
3,John's Solo Career Never Took Off,"John Farrar was the most talented song writer of the 1970's. I hate to overshadow him in his own review, but his fame comes from being the songwriter of Olivia Newton-John's hit songs. This album is out of print, and it is a pity. John Farrar could have stood on his own. Somehow though it never happened. His version of ""Recovery"" is amazing and nearly as good, if not better than Olivia's. John still writes music, but not very often. Hard to find Cd, but worth it."
4,Mysterious Bones in Wales,"Sheep is the debut novel of Simon Maginn. It tells the story of a family who moves to Wales, hoping to overcome the death of their daughter by drowning. However, the house they've moved into has a horrible past and a series of bloody events lets them know that the past has caught up with the present. Unfortunately, the ending doesn't really live up to the first 5/6ths of the book-- but still worth reading if you're a fan of writers like Ramsey Campbell. Moody, atmospheric, intelligent horror."
1,Boring!,"I agree with ""Painful."" I am so disappointed in this book. Facts, figures, and no life. But it wasn't a total loss; I learned about the Metis, a group of people descended from Indians and French trappers who forged a unique culture with French and Aboringinal elements. With their leader, Louis Riel, they rebelled against the Canadian government in the 1880s and set up their own (short-lived) independent country!"
5,Wonderful item,"My mother recently bought me this pack and play for my upcoming arrival. I went ahead and put it together, to see how easy or hard it would be. The only bad thing I have to say about this item is the directions on putting it together. I had to staire at the mannual several times to understand what hooked on where. But once it was put together, it was easy to take apart and pack up. I have been baby-sitting a 6 week old, and I'm glad to say that I know this will come in handy and in need when my baby arrives. I was planning on buying a mini co-sleeper to go in our bedroom, but with this item, it comes with a bassinet and it is at the right height for getting the baby out easily from our bed. All in all, this item is wonderful and would be a god-send to any new mother."
4,Canopy Could Be Better,"I received this as a gift for my baby. I use it every day. My baby is three months now and enjoys the sheeps dangling from the canopy. It is an adorable item. However, the canopy does not stay on very well. It seems to be constantly popping up even though I snap it down. You'd think they could make a better canopy for how much this cost. I do like all of its features (music, vibration, nature sounds, etc). When my baby is old enough, I am sure he will enjoy it more. I opted not to take this with me while traveling. Though it does pack up nicely, it is still a bit on the heavy side for me. But on the upside, it is great to wheel around the house when you need to roam from room-to-room. I've looked everywhere for a canopy for this product to keep the cats off it but can't find one. Any ideas where I can find it???"
5,Excellent!,"We used this PNP as a bassinette (sp?) until baby was big enough to move to her crib. She loved the sounds as well as the vibration in helping her fall asleep easily. We now use it to ""contain"" her while we are doing something that will take our attention for a period of time. It is VERY easy to move from room to room as well to pack up and take on outings. I would defenitly reccomend this item! We will be keeping this one for future babes!"
5,Counting Down,"Living overseas, it was such a joy to know this item could be shipped to us. I assembled the pack and play the day I received it in the mail, and it was very simple. It is lightweight and the wheels make it very easy to move from room to room. I do love the bassinet and changing table. The only thing I wish would change is the maximum weight for the bassinet. When breast feeding, infants tend to put on weight farely quickly, and I am worried that I will not be able to use the bassinet for as long as I had hoped. I'm due in the beginning of July, so I'll have to update this response then."
4,"Beautiful color, good price","I was very pleased when these candles arrived. I used them in a traditional colonial brass sconce, as well as a pair of Waterford candle holders. They are a beautiful cream color.Two days later I was in a local card store and saw the same items, but for much more money.I highly recommend these candles."
4,Nice clad,"The deep sides of this handy and versatile 10-inch covered everything pan provides ample room to sear meats and then add liquid to stew or braise. Ideal for virtually any cooking task, its durable construction features a core of aluminum sandwiched between two layers of stainless steel."
2,Not my Favorite Pan,"This pan is better for serving in than for cooking. It tends to burn things easily. I have other stainless steel pans that I have no problem with. It could be that the lid lets too much steam escape, or maybe it's just too shallow."
5,I love this pan!,"I love this pan. It is versatile and pretty enough to go directly from the stove top or oven to the table. The lid from this pan also fits the 10"" skillet."
4,Kitchenaid Clad 10-Inch Covered Everything Pan,"There isn't a lot to say about this, other than this pan demonstrates the Kitchenaid high quality that one would expect from Kitchenaid. It's extremely well made and of very high quality."
1,Dissapointed,"I purchased this book for my daughter through my iPhone but it was never downloaded to my kindle fire. Even though it gave me the option of downloading it to my kindle, it just didn't work. It was very frustrating and after trying numerous times to download it to my kindle I gave up and got a refund. It was not worth it even though the price was perfect."
5,The Ventures never sounded better!,"What an incredible find these Ventures reissues are! As a kid I always loved the group, but tended to buy only their singles. Now I can also enjoy the superb sounds of such classics as ""Trambone"" and ""Meet Mr. Callaghan"" from ""Another Smash""and ""Bluer Than Blue"" from ""The Colourful Ventures"" as well. The guy who wrote the first review either never heard the originals or somehow got the group mixed up with somebody else! This disc has magnificent sound, and the tracks are all original."
3,"Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat.","This CD features the Ventures third and fourth albums.Another Smash is a typical early '60s Ventures album. It features one chart single, the classic ""Lullaby of the Leaves"", plus a lot of cover versions of recent instrumental hits and two Ventures originals. ""Riders in the Sky"" is especially good.The Colorful Ventures features songs with colors in the title. ""Silver City"" and ""Blue Moon"" were chart singles from this album. Other solid covers include ""Blue Skies"", ""Red Top"" and ""White Silver Sands"". But the real highlight of the album is the great Ventures original ""Yellow Jacket""."
1,Big Disappointment!,I was expecting a CD version of the original Dolton recordings. I was very disappointed that this was an obvious re-recording without any of the energy and drive of the original records. Since when did violins belong in a Ventures recording? The packaging lets you believe that this would be the original tracks. Don't make the same mistake.
1,original recording?,I own an original 'COLORFUL VENTURES' dolton album and was set to thinking about the 'DISAPPOINTED' reviewer from virginia and his thoughts of this 'coloUrful ventures' release.
3,Worth an Afternoon,"There was nothing outstanding about this mystery in which a beautiful dancer goes missing and Hannah is put on the case. It is a better way to kill a few hours than watching most TV shows. I liked her Venus book quite a bit, so tried this more traditional Dunant. I hope she either has more of the Venus variety or is intending to write more historical mysteries. The writing in that book was lovely. Doesn't even seem like the same writer."
3,Birth Marks: A Hannah Wolfe Crime Novel,"Crime novel with an unusual twist. I thought I had the criminal pegged, but I guessed wrong! I'll bet you would too."
2,Mama Learned Us to Work,This book has a great picture cover and the title catches ones attention. The book is about rural women doing what it takes to survive. Very interesting.
4,Very pleasantly surprised,"I had purchased this 2-CD set to have both the Italian and English versions of Gloria and Ti Amo for my music collection. Both are songs that Umberto Tozzi co-wrote and had a big success with first, before Laura Branigan covered these songs in the 1980's and had her own smash success across the seas in the USA. What I was surprised to find was that the entire 2-CD set is very enjoyable whether one knows Italian or not. His greatest hits span a long career and include ballads, rock and pop songs, and even an electric remake of Gloria! Very suave. A very impressive list of hits from this Italian singer-songwriter indeed! Highly recommended!"
2,Not what it sounds like,I should have waited for the pictures to load up on my dial up before I excitedly purchased the product. It is not the massaging thong I had hoped for.
3,Not helpfull,"This book have some general information about doing buisness on ebay, but it's far away from guiding the beginners and make their start at ebay easier. I didn't find most of the information I needed :("
1,WORTHLESS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you want to start an Ebay business, this isn't the book to buy. This book would have been just as helpful if the pages were blank. I feel like a dummy for buying it."
5,Starting an eBay Business for Dummies - Marsha Collier,"This is a book that everyone that desires to sell on on-line auctions should read. Marsha is down to earth. I just attended eBay Live in Anaheim, CA & she conducted several seminars. I have also attended eBay University in Clearwater, FL where she spoke. She does not just tell you how to do the business, she successfully does the business and shares what she has learned over a long period of time! This book is a small investment that will pay off big time!"
2,Not a whole lot of revealing information,"During trying to put my personal retail business on-line I read this book. The book was easy to read and amusing but there wasn't very much stuff that a semi-intelligent person with common sense couldn't have figured out for themselves.This is the only book I've read on this subject so I can't really compare it to other titles, but if I had it to do over again I would either buy a different book or just learn about eBay on eBay."
1,Ebay Business /wrong book,"Bought wrong book, thought this was the very 1st starter book for how to get started with selling on Ebay. A little too adavnced for the true beginner. But my fault for buying the wrong book. Incidentally, Amazon charged me $8.00 plus change to ""restock"" the book. No fair."
4,Starting an eBay Busines for Dummies,Very helpful referance. You don't have to read it from cover to cover to get the information you need.
1,Bad news Book,"I would rate this book lower than one star if there was an option for that. I cannot say this book is a complete loss, you may use it for a door stop. It has not one iota of what people want to know in a book of this type. It doesn't even address the subject, where to find things to sell. If you are looking for a book on starting and on line store forget this book."
2,Disappointing,"This book is very vague...I thought that she would give somekind of paperwork/computer/method of organizing and keeping track of things, but she glosses over (in my opnion) the details that one needs to become a powerseller! You'll probably see my copy up for sale on ebay soon!"
2,"Some interesting information, but lacking vital elements","I was really disappointed in the section about where to find items to sell. I know that is the big ""secret"" to ebay business, finding cheap items to sell at a higher price, but if this book is supposed to help you start a business, that should be included.Also, the information on taxes, etc was very confusing. I had to go online and learn about it for myself, and when I found the answers, it was so simple and could have easily been added to this book.This book seemed sort of thrown together and half hearted. I haven't used it at all since I bought it last year."
1,For Newbies ONLY...,"If you've ever auctioned anything on eBay, then you DO NOT need this book.Everything that has been compiled in this book could easily be found on eBay itself with a few hours of research. From selling to buying and receiving payment, this book goes thru all the obvious steps without actually telling you anything that you probably didn't already know.If you are new to eBay, you may find some of the URL's (to navigate eBay) listed in the book useful, but not much more.I've owned the book for 3 days and I've already listed it for auction."
3,Great For Americans - But What About the Rest of the World?,"I'm a Canadian seller on eBay, and although most of the information within the book was quite applicable to me, much was very US-centric. For example, the sections on shipping, payment options, and legalities.Otherwise, the book was great for NEW sellers on eBay - I found the information was very basic, and mostly things I know (even if I ignore them.) I did find the section on communication with your buyer very helpful, as it provided examples of emails to send at end of auction, missing payment, and day of shipping.Overall, if you are just getting started at eBay, this book is EXACTLY what you need to catch up to the rest of us very quickly and effectively - I wish I'd had this book 2 years ago when I began. But if you're a seasoned eBayer, I think you will find yourself quickly flipping through the pages seeking new information."
4,Great book!,"If you're looking to start an eBay business, this is a great, no-nonsense, easy read. It's loaded with useful tips, information, and websites. Definitely worth the money."
4,Useful,"Some useful information on ebay. Not all ideas work for all items being sold, but gives you ideas."
3,ebay business for dummies,"Kind of ""over my head"". Keep it on hand for reference and hopefully will eventually use it... Thank you very much"
5,Great book,"In the beginning of this book which was in excellant condition by the way, it told me that it assumed that I had read ebay for dummies which I ordered and am in the process of reading so I can't say anything about the contents of this book yet. I haven't found a ""dummies"" book yet that I didn't enjoy reading and was very educational. I am retiring in a couple of months and don't really want to take a part time job per say. I'm doing some buying on ebay myself and seeing what is selling and since I love to shop I think this is the avenue I want to try=selling on ebay."
4,A great way to work at home,This book helped me start up my ebay selling. A good primer for any one wanting to sell on ebay. Lots of tip and tricks.
1,So Outdated!,"I'm sure this book might have been useful when it came out three years ago, but as a current eBay seller who just read the entire book, I have to say the information is so outdated it's laughable now. eBay has changed so much even in the last six months that many of the things the author discusses don't even exist anymore, and have been replaced by new eBay enhancements. I would estimate that 10% or less of this book was useful to me. A waste of your time and money until an updated version comes out!"
5,Jam-packed with useful information!,"Hooray for Marsha Collier new book ""Starting an E-bay Business for Dummies""! This book is like sharing a cup of coffee with an E-bay expert, it's easy to follow and fun to read. Each page is full of fantastic ideas, helpful hints, and even easy step by step instructions on how to build your own e-bay store. Ms. Collier shares her professional ""know how"" in a way that even a newbie like me can succeed. A MUST for anyone who wants to make some extra cash fast."
1,Sellers are charging TOO much money,"I see this lighter is being sold for over $42 which is Insane! You can buy this at Target for $4.99!God, I hate greedy vendors..."
5,Works well,This is a nice lighter. I like the movable arm. I have gotten a lot of lights from it so far. The price is right. I bought a couple. And I will buy more when needed.
3,Could Be Better,"Although the product does offer the advantage of a multi-position wand, there are a couple of things I wish they had done differently. First, the flame is not adjustable. The flame is rather long, and if a candle is stubborn and doesn't light right away the flame will be burning up the top of the candle. The best way to avoid this is to point the wand straight down, but if you do this for more than a few seconds the metal tip gets quite hot. You're also using up a lot of fuel in cases when you don't need to. This ties in to my second complaint, the lighter is not refillable. The unit is a bit expensive to just be thrown away, plus tossing out all that hard plastic and metal seems a bit wasteful.Unless you have container candles that are too difficult to light with a match, I would stick with matches or butane candle lighter that can be refilled."
4,Buildining your Culture Competency,"In most organizations, changing your culture to a new culture that support your change is the most difficalt that face organization. Adopting compentencies or mismatch the real organization needs may lead to change failure. This book will provide you the tool how to create your needed compentences to your culture change. It provides a very clear guidelines that will assist conultants and management as well to indentify thier direction. So are you in the right direction to create the targeted culture or not? One of the few new books that addresses these issues. I highly recommend this book for organizations who are in the process of a change or going to one. additionaly if you are reviewing your organization change and culture, this would be one of the book that is helpful to you."
5,The only music video I've ever owned!,"I love this collection. The highlights for me are Nenah Cherry's ""Under My Skin"" and Iggy Pop & Deborah Harry's duet in ""Did You Ever?."" But there is virtually not a bad note or image on the whole video! I just wish it would be rereleased on DVD . . . ."
5,Akua Tuta by Kastin,"This CD was in great condition. I owned this CD earlier and someone liked it so much, I gave it to them so this order was my own replacement. If this seller has more Native American music, I'd be interested to know the titles and the prices."
3,Let the Digital Copy Games Begin,"Enjoyed the movie, but what is up with the Digital Copy games? Only can use it on Windows Media Player? Why the change from how other Digital Copies were provided? I don't remember Warner Brothers' The Dark Knight Digital Copy being only available for WMP. The term Digital Copy should mean that it can be played ""digitally"" by media players, not specific to a single type of player. There are a ton of Window users that use iTunes and iPods that don't want to use WMP. Hey Warner Brothers, at least offer both formats!!!"
3,"Great movie, bad digital copy","Not only is the digital copy not compatible with iTunes, but you can not download it to a Mac at all. Bad move Warner Brothers."
2,poorly made,"I was kind of excited to get an animated green lantern blu-ray. But my enthusiasm quickly diminished as the movie went on. I found the story to be extremely lacking. Also the movie was poorly drawn and rendered. Bah, hopefully someone else will take a crack at it and do better."
1,Green Lantern Butchered,I'll keep this short and sweet:-They've butchered the Green Lantern story-This is NOT how the Sinestro Corps happened-Sinestro has a floating yellow power battery that zaps things?-Story is horrid-Character design is horrid-This is a disgrace to the Green Lantern franchise. How could DC let this happen?-Only people who've never read anything GL could like this and I'm sorry for you.
2,In outer space,"Only get this if you're in the mood for a story which largely takes place in outer space.I wasn't, and stopped watching halfway."
5,This is why fake people!!,I was raised on the cartoons from the 80s on. I love animated (cartoon) and I will buy the video. Animated is for cool people.
1,Why not real people???,I was raised on the comics from the 40's on. I don't like animated (cartoon) and I won't buy the video. Animated is for the kids.
2,not much more than a basic story,"""Green Lantern: First Flight"" does not offer much more than a basic story and a lot of generic fights. The other DC PG-13 animated features, such as ""Superman Doomsday"" and ""Justice League: The New Frontier"" have either more exciting action or better stories. The rules about the Green Lantern's powers were also unclear in the movie. It was unclear why he would be in distress one moment and then winning the next. The animation is okay but not pretty or creative. This movie is mostly for fans of all the various DC TV cartoons, rather than a brooder audience. Reviewed 8/25/2009 after watching on Blu-ray."
4,it was a great film.,"this was yet another great film from waner premier. i'm not a fan of green lantern, but i've enjoyed this one out of the bunch. for the price i paid it was worth it. thanks again for the right prices amazon & your sellers that you deal with. i've almost completed my collection for now. but it was a great story, yet the voices were a great choice, too. some i've never heard of, but it was knowing the fact that they maybe used for others on down the line. bottom line, if you like the green lantern comics, you will not be disappointed."
3,The best of its kind,"It's as good as can be expected for a cartoon movie about an underappreciated DC Comics character. Sure, he's not Superman but I find the story of Hal Jordan and the Green Lanter Corps to be the most interesting of all the DC universe. This rendition is not exactly how it happened but it's close enough for CA movie standards; meaning movies that claim to be ""based on a true story"" are about 50% accurate at best. I look forward to the live-action movie coming out 2011."
4,Very Good Comic Book Adaptation! Recommended,"""Green Lantern: First Light"" really captured the feel of the comic books I remember from over 30 years ago. Green Lantern was one of my all time favorites and I'm glad that the movie pretty much stayed true to the spirit of the original comics.Very little time is spent setting up Hal Jordan's admission into the Green Lantern Corps and he is quickly thrown into the middle of a battle that will affect the future of the universe (doesn't it always :-) This is a solid comic book style plot that is blessed with a decent script. The animation is nothing special, but it is good enough to avoid being a distraction.Recommended!"
3,Fairly pedestrian effort.,"This is really just a so-so affair. Meloney himself is a decent voice for Hal Jordan, and the movie isnt horrible by any means. However, it really isnt exceptional either, and plenty of parts leave one wondering why this battle or that was really so difficult in the first place. Basically, this is an origin story, specifically, Hal Jordan's entry into the ranks of the Green Lanterns, and Sinestro's eventual betrayal by claiming the Yellow Lantern. Like i say, it's not horrible, and you'll probably enjoy it at least a little, but i had to turn it off out of boredom at one point and finish it later. So, for me at least, a pedestrian effort worthy of a middling three stars."
4,Very good DVD set,"My family and I enjoyed this DVD. Its well done and a lot of fun. My daughter and I would have loved it if they would have done more about the other color lanterns. They only talk vaguely about Blackest Night, which is going on in the comics at this time, so it could be viewed totally independently. You don't need to read the comics to follow this story. Still, we would have enjoyed more comic book related stuff on the bonus features. But over all it was worth the money."
3,Stilted TV type cartoon,"I will not argue with the Amazon review that talks about a great story--the plot does move and there is plenty of action...My complaint is that we are paying Blu Ray prices for what would normally be found as a theatrical motion picture release....Why then the treatment as an extended version of the very stilted, alomost stop motion animation....If you are going to try and extract the same price out of the public as say, Wall-E or Ratatoille or similar Pixar features, then someone should belly up and make it better than the standard TV quality crap;On to live action and regrettable that it was Ryan Reynolds vs Nathan Fillion..."
3,great but could be better,i think it was great just wished they developed the hal jordan character further hopefully they will not make the same mistake on the big screen
2,Not what I was expecting,"With all the hype that surrounded this film I was very dissapointed in the story line. This might be a spoiler but the biggest problem I had was the fact that the movie was named ""First Flight"" and yet Hal knows how to use his ring as soon as he puts it on. I did not want to see a comic book turned into a animated movie with the script being word for word from it, but some form of linear progression would have been appriciated. The characters are also surprisingly one dimensional and most of that has to do with the fact that much of their backstory is left out. Jordan's military background, Sinestro's rule over his own planet, and even Kilowog being in charge of handling new members. The animation was incredible and the action scenes do deliver, but I would honestly rent this movie before buying it."
1,"Movie is okay, but digital copy doesn't work like other DC or WB products","The movie is okay, and even has some really nice moments from a visual stand point. The plot is paper thin, but the action sequences are pretty. However, I have been taking advantage of these digital copy versions so that I can put the movies on an ipod touch for my kids. It doesn't make sense to not support the format that dominates how digital content is consumed. The ipod and itunes are by far the most used products when it comes to digital content consumption. They're trying to force those of us that use this feature to buy the movie twice, which is sleazy. It would be nice if they at least differentiated the versions that are itunes/ipod compatible and the ones that aren't."
2,One Dimentional and simplistic,"I am by no means a huge Green Lantern officanato (meaning I have read only a handful of GL comics, but I do enjoy GL. I was certainly disappointed with the movie. Not for continuity issues or anything nick picky like that, but simply I felt the story was very rushed and one dimensional. Like one review said it was straight to the action, it had no character development, at all. I would imagine this would be entertaining if I was under the age of 13, but honestly the straight forward ""Jordan has ring, One Lantern is Bad, Lets all fight, Jordan saves the day"" Story was just too bland.Great art, and great voice acting by far. But the story was simply lacking. Certainly not worth buying (unless its for the kids)."
1,digital copy will not work.,The digital copy does not have Itunes support. Warner Brothers should be ashamed to have advertised this movie with a digital copy.
2,Why why why?,"Why, why, why? Why PG-13 kids movies?If you are The Dark Knight, more power to you. Spoiler alert- you ARE NOT The Dark Knight. The PG-13 route for something that could be kid-friendly shows you are not making good products. If you can't make something appeal to everyone (hey, ever hear of Empire Strikes Back? I hear that did pretty well) without being ""too cool for school"" for the sake of pretending to be edgy then follow this procedure. Stop. Start over. Repeat this process until you can make something good without false edginess."
1,Save your money.,"Buyer Beware! Rent this movie BEFORE you spend any money on it. Bad does not begin to describe the total lack of story. Micheal Bay fans, ok you might like it. 77 Minutes of film 3 minutes of story, ugh. On the plus side it does have the Green Lantern episode of Duck Dodgers, and that almost makes the disk work while. Duck Dodgers was far, far superior to First Flight in every way."
1,Digital Copy - Sort Of,Digital Copy is Windows only. No iPod. No iTunes. No returns on opened DVD's. No disclosure ANYWHERE on the page - except for product reviews.
4,Green Lantern,I enjoyed the video. The animation was good and it was good to see the origins of the green lantern come to light. But could have had more character development for the main character and why the rings would allow certain green lantern members to become evil without anyone knowing. Isn't the ring supposed to pick good hearted people?
3,Really? Digital copy not iTunes compatible?,"Great movie, loads of fun.BUT...In this day and age, why even bother including a digital copy that's NOT compatible with iTunes?That's just ridiculous."
4,Better than the live action,"Thanks alot, write Alan Burnett, for ignoring all the things that made Green Lantern cool over the last five years, and replacing them with a 70 minute slug fest. No character devel, no back story, no explanation of how the ring works and why, just lotsa lotsa 'splosions. Animation is good, but that's about it.UPDATE: 12-29-2011Okay, now that i've had to see this film again as well as the Ryan Reynolds version a couple of times, i'm willing to cut this movie a lot more slack. Although this film is still dry and far too serious and dark in tone, it does a good job showing Sinestro turn from good to the infamous supervillain. That is in contrast to the terrible live action film, which, if you didn't know sinestro's back story, you'd be severely confused why he, the greatest of the lanterns, would suddenly betray them. For those who are curious about Green Lantern but were thoroughly turned off by the cruddy live action film, then give this one a shot."
5,Green Lantern: First Flight,"Great movie on how Hal Jordan became the Green Lantern. if you're a comic book fan, pick this one up."
5,Hal Jordan is Green Lantern!,"Even though I do like John Stewart and Kyle Raymer,I have always preferred Hal Jordan as Green Lantern. That being said,I really enjoyed this movie. Kudos to Chris Meloni and Victor Garber-they were perfect choices for their respective characters. Chris brought a boyish charm to Hal and Victor really brought the nastiness out in Sinestro. If you have ever wondered about why the Lanterns are powerless against the color yellow,you will get your answer in this movie. I can certainly understand the PG13 rating-this movie is defnitely not for young children,but teens & adults alike will love it!"
2,BLU RAY EDITION-NOTE DIGITAL COPY IS PC ONLY!!!,"I am sure this is a fantastic movie- but I wanted to warn any of you who would expect WB to be able to do what they do for their other releases (ahem BLU RAY Watchmen )THE DIGITAL COPY of this movie is PC ONLY!!!! Kind a big detail to overlook, since nearly every current digital copy is PC/MAC. Just wanted to let you know and review was only way I knew how to. Thanks and enjoy green lantern. Just wish I could have known that before I purchased it!"
2,Green Lantern Blue Ray ITUNES PROBLEM!!!!!,"This movie was another excellent animated offering from WB/DC COMICS ANimation!!! I enjoyed this version of the Hal Jordan origin story. However, I was very upset to learn that the DIGITAL COPY is now NOT offering the iTunes option for the digital copy. I have bought alot of Blu Rays and this is a big added benefit to be able to put it in my itunes libary for portable watching. I like many of you, use my iPods to watch video on the road. The PC DRM video file is not compatible with itunes, so this ""feature"" is completely useless to me now. WAY TO GO WB!!!! Why did you mess with this??? Even worse, if you had to monkey with this you should make this clear that this is NO LONGER COMPATIBLE WITH ITUNES!!! BAIT AND SWITCH!!! Just dump this feature and make the disc cheaper if you are going to do something like this! I did like the itunes file and was willing to pay the higher blue ray price for it! BAD MOVE! Buyer beware..."
2,"Movie is GREAT, digital copy is WINDOWS ONLY","Great animated movie - period.I'm giving this release two stars as once again, Warner Bros shafts the Mac community with another Windows-only digital copy. Doesn't work on iPods / iPhones? Funny, as those are the highest selling portable music / video players out today.Get a clue WB."
4,some house mixes--one edited!!!,"Aside from the album version and a mix of the album version with a little extra something from Fabolous, you get two house mixes. The Bimbo Jones mix is the edit, not the full length version. This mix is more commercial house and not as slammin' as the second, longer house mix, the Delinquent mix. Well worth having for the remixes. i just don't understand why they always have to put an edit of one mix on these things."
3,Not a review so much as a correction...,"...of the previous reviewer's comment that part of ""Science Fiction Suite"" was based on ""Wondrous Stories"" by Yes. I bought both this album and ""Going for the One"" when they were originally released, and considering that the Acqua Fragile debut came out more than a year before ""Going for the One,"" I doubt they were influenced by ""Wondrous Stories!"" Perhaps it was the other way around!By the way, this is a pretty good album, if you're a mid-70's prog enthusiast."
3,Solid debut effort.,"This debut by the Italian prog-outfit Acqua was released in Italy in 1976. They remained together for two albums until the vocalist, Bernardo Lanzetti, went on to front PFM. This is a strong effort. There are brief moments when one is reminded of early Genesis and early Gentle Giant but overall they have an original sound. The musicianship is competent but not of as high a caliber as one would wish (they are no PFM). The vocals, which are in english, are outstanding even if the lyrics are occassionally awkward. A couple of the cuts fall short but overall it's a satisfying listen. Worth obtaining but not essential...Simon"
1,Outdated video,"The video was produced 20 years ago. Everything in it looks outdated.It keeps telling the audience to refer to the manual for details, but the DVD didn't come with any printed material.Just google ""haircut techniques"", and you will find better instructions online for free."
3,A lazy three stars...,"Following the theory that is masked behind the walls of hyperinflation, this book proves to the reader that it can not only be penetrated but is illegitimate as well. I have had the pleasure of working with well known Dr. Igbus from Stanford who has foreshadowed the various topics found within the cover of this book. Its ideas and conjectures about the role of supply and demand on hyperinflation issues are controversial but do not lie outside of the bounds of being comprehended. Although the hypothesis made does not have supportable evidence to back it, that does not make it inplausible. Moreover, the pros far outweigh the cons making this book a credible source for the common economist."
5,childhood,"My father assisted in designing the music studios for Warner Brothers in the late sixties, early seventies. As compensation for his work he was given hundreds of albums stamped ""WB Demo"". Being born in 1974 I thought nothing of it...until I was ""old enough to know better"". My parents decided to have a big garage sale in about 1996. My father put out crate after crate of vinyl records. My brother and boyfriend went through the records and salvaged tons of classics. I was blessed and graced enough to receive the Barefoot Jerry self title album, 1973. To this day it is still one of my most favorite albums. The musical talent and diversity in this album is remarkable. Those who are heavily influenced by the fabulous music put out in the late sixties/early seventies will be sure to find this record worth several listens.I know this is a compilation set but the songs of the '73 album are phenomenal. Peace and blessings to you all."
3,Church Offering Deposit Bags,"Our church's ushers needed bags to put offerings in following our worship services, so we got these. Two of them can sign the bag, stuff in the offerings, seal it, and drop it in the safe until Monday morning. These give us good peace of mind when it comes to how we handle our money."
5,Black Metal Lives,"These bands individually are all pushing forward the heart of what 'true' black metal means without getting stuck in the rut of so many bands who want to clone the past. Together they've created a masterful work of melodic noise, dark atmosphere's and darkly beautiful sound-scapes of endless despair. This, along with Nachtmystium's 'Demise' album are probably two of the greatest signs that America has take the pass of the torch and run with it to express the gospel of Black Metal in their own voice. The glamorous bastardization's of popular ""black metal"" will never satisfy those of us who need something more real... Twilight does not disappoint. From the intense first track they ward off those who will never understand, and call out to those who'll hear their voice.HAIL. BLACK METAL!!!"
5,Holy Shishkabob...,"Dude...this album is insane. I cannot believe that us Americans can do black metal so well. I mean, lately in black metal, actually in metal in general, foreigners are kicking our @$$. The vocals, for me, is what really makes this album extremely brutal. Sounds like Gaahl on 100 hits of steroids haha. The synth in the background is pure beauty. Only in black metal can you find strings that really sing. Also, alot of people dont like the production of alot of black metal bands. But i say the bad production makes the music sound more grim, dark, an sinister, i.e. Darkthrone, MayheM (Pre-De Mysteriis) So i say Horns to you Twilight for making insane black metal, Horns to Black Metal in general, Horns to you black metal fans for keeping it alive, and of course... Horns to Satan!!"
3,Good but could have been great!!!,"I consider myself a fan of black metal and I understand the idea that a less than stellar production creates a dark atmosphere. When I first played this cd the first thing that came to mind was that the production was actually too bad to even be audible. When I really concentrated my ears to get through the muddy production I found amazing riffs and song structures very original in today's black metal. Every member in the band is extremely talented, but raising the production level a notch or two would make this album absolutely amazing. If you don't mind digging through some of the muddiest production out there you will love this, but if you don't be forewarned. Overall, a band with amazing talent and song structures but the production makes it extremely tough to enjoy. Hoping the next time the American black metal supergroup releases an album it will be with a little better production. Enjoy!"
1,less than average,These guys sound like they recorded this cd in a trash can. I don't need my metal polished but it has to sound good. Eighteen dollars gone.
5,Pure factory original.,"I use discount autostore stuff in my other cars but want factory original quality in my classic corvette.This unit is identical to what came in the car, down to the exact part numbers. Factory original.And still cheaper at Amazon, than my local discount autopart store, with some off brand, probably made in china."
3,Not up to par:,"I have read every single one of Johanna Lindsey's books, but with the last three, The Joining, The Heir, and The Present, I was left feeling nothing!! I was completely bored and wondered where all the action was or just the good old plain love stories of her other books. I found myself not wanting to read anymore of her books now although I will because I keep hoping she'll get better!!! Please Johanna give me some more of the books like Man of My Dreams, which I read 3 times!!!! I love almost all of your other work........"
1,"""The Heir""","I have always loved Johanna Lindsey but this book was so sophomoric and juvenile I could hardly finish it. Come on old girl, lets at least give it the old college try."
1,"""THIS is a Lindsey novel??""","I have been a great admirer and avid reader of JL novel's for many years (a few personal favorites being: Savage Thunder, Once A Princess and The Malory Novels). I was disappointed with The Heir. The characters were superficial and the story line barely kept me awake. Nothing like the Lindsey I've read in the past. Nothing. No sparks flying, no fireworks at all. I usually read a JL novel in 1 to 2 nights - this book took me 2 weeks to finish! And only because I hate starting a novel and not finishing it.Ms. Lindsey - you can definitely do better. **HINT: How about a novel on Jeremy Malory?**"
1,What a waste of time,"I had always heard good things about Lindsey's books but I must say this one was a complete waste. I was expecting SOME romance in this romance novel and there was none. I was totally hating Duncan about half way through, and totally tired of ""friends"" as well. It took every thing I had to finish the book (hoping in the end it would redeem itself.) Unfortunately that wasn't the case. So disappointing."
3,"Better than ""The Joining"", but.......",Still not up to the standards of the old Johanna. The characters just weren't as interesting or passionate as many that she has done in the past. This author can do much better. She needs to rediscover her strengths and get back to what she does best. If I may make a suggestion..... Jeremy Malory!!!!!
1,Just Plain Ol' BORING!!!!,"The hero doesn't lust after the heroine at all! There's not one sentence which talks about why he wants her. But all of a sudden he's in love with her? I got sick of reading about how beautiful Ophelia was (blonde, blue eyed,skinny) and how ""not a beauty"" the heroine was (a dowdy brunette with curves, though). The weird thing is the hero never speaks of her looks... She was supposed to be funny and witty, but, it was corny and annoying! The hero seemed more a boy than a man. I didn't dislike the characters but I didn't like them either. I was indifferent. Oh, and what's really weird is that they really were JUST FRIENDS, in my opinion.THIS BOOK IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!"
2,Not Ms. Lindsey's best work!,"I am a big fan of Ms. Lindsey and I have read all of her books, but I have to say that I was disappointed with this book. It was not her usual writing and I kept wondering what had happened for her to write such a story. I felt that there was no real romance between Sabrina and Duncan; they lacked the chemistry of Ms. Lindsey's characters from her previous books. I found myself more interested in Ophelia's character and how she was developing than in the relationship between Sabrina and Duncan. I hope she will do better with her next book and I still look forward to reading her works. It would be nice to read more about Raphael, I found him to be intriguing."
3,All the spice of baby formula,"This was the first Johanna Lindsey novel I had read in years. How disappointing. The chemistry between Duncan and Sabrina was non-existent, they certainly didn't spar and the love scenes (there are only two) are boring! The only character that really interested me was Ophelia (the bad girl). At least she had some spark."
4,I liked it!,"Normally I prefer books with a London ""Ton"" setting, but this one was pretty good without my favorite backgrounds... the characters were likable, some great twists to expected plot lines. I'd buy it again - which is my personal standard for romance novels."
2,Is this a new trend?,"I have all of Ms. Lindsay's books ,I only read a handful of authors. I always looked foward to a new release. I felt like the past few books have lacked any kind of passion or conflict. Is it because hard covers have to be more politically correct? That is not why I read fiction. I agree with one of the other reviews about liking Ophelia's character better in the end. She had real emotion. I thought fixing her up with Rafe who hated her would have had more to offer. The kidnapping made no sense and I forgot about it until I read it in these reviews. I gave it 2 stars because I finished it. It is a readable book that has no real surprises. I feel this has happened with Jude Devereaux and Judith McNaught also. Their books have seemed to get tamer since they have come out in hardcover."
2,Sadly lacking!,I have in the past really enjoyed Lindsey's books. This just like the previous book of hers is a true exception. Both have been lacking something and I even debated on whether or not to buy this one. Well....I did buy it and wish that I had just went to the local library and checked it out... The characters in this book were mundane and it was hard to find true passion between the characters that was authentic and believable. I sincerely hope her books improve. This one just doesn't seem to have the depth previous books of Lindsey's have. Sorry....wish this could be a better review....
2,"...and I thought ""The Joining"" was bad...","I was expecting another exciting Johanna Lindsey Highland story with a Sexy Highlander like Lachlan MacGregor from ""Love Me Forever."" Boy - was I sorely disappointed. Duncan (the Hero) is about as sexy as a slug! He isn't even interesting. In fact, the Hero and the heroine spend very little time together during the whole course of the book. Don't expect any steaming love scenes either. The passion between these two is at the very least luke warm. Do yourself a favor, buy this book used."
2,spent money on the hardback,"sigh. Having enjoyed Johanna Lindsey's books for a long time, I was excited to see the Heir come out. I have noticed, like a few reviewers before me, that he latest book have lacked the flair that her earlier books have had. I am actually a bit depressed to spent the money on the hardback version, which I rarely do with books unless I know the author well. I found it to be a sweet story, but it just didn't keep my interest that well. It is all right if you are looking for a sweet story about two friends falling in love (more like it happens in real life, which is great in real life, but that isn't why I read romance novels....), this is for you. If you are looking for the sensual passion found in Ms. Lindsey's earlier works, you will, more likely than not, be dissapointed."
3,Average,"Johanna Lindsey is my favorite author, but I was disappointed in this book. I thought the 2 main characters were lacking in passion and there was no real excitement in their romance. I feel Sabrina would have been better paired off with Rafe. The kidnapping made no real sense. I did enjoy Sabrina's character,especially when she got mad and the 2 grandfathers, also the aunts were funny. I hope the next book is up the Lindseys usual standards."
2,Where are the Mallorys? Reggie Would Sort this Mess Out!,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I love J. Lindsey's work. Regencies are my favorite. But...these characters were SO one dimensional. She makes him laugh. That is it. That is her only personality characteristic. He is Scottish & says ""blaudy"" every other word. That is it for him. The heavy Scottish brogue was a bit wearing. Things were getting so dull I was rooting for Ophelia to win! At least she had some spark to her. The thing that got me is that the characters, though thin, were not true to themselves. They were not the sort of people to have a quick interlude in the carriage. That totally did not make sense or fit in with the characters."
4,Good read by Lindsey,"Johanna Lindsey has done it again! OK, so those readers before me have given it a lower rating - so what do they expect? Constant perfection? FYI, I purchased THE HEIR at 5:30 PM last night, attended a night school class, and still had to finish it before I went to bed. The characters were good, the situation entertaining and the grandfathers the best. There was a time or two that I would have loved to have slapped a certain female character but she was an integral part of the plot. Like most of you, I'm waiting for Jeremy's book, but in the meantime I'll buy any Lindsey offered for sale!"
2,Disapointed .,"I found the heroine and the hero so immature. Plus the ""beautiful gal"" totally obnoxious. There was no growth for the character and the other major people just sat back and just watched to see how their lives would work out. I found it VERY difficult to finish the book."
1,HORRIBLE!,I usually like Lindsey's works and there are some better than others but this one is the worst she's ever done. I didn't care for the characters and she seems to have the habit of having other plots combined with the main plot which is annoying because they come out of the blue and it doesn't enhance the story. A big disappointment! I hope this won't happen again or she hasn't lost her touch!
1,UNBELIEVABLE- A DUMBING DOWN OF A BEACH BOOK,"THERE WAS NO STORY, NO CONFLICT. CHARACTERS WERE STEREOTYPES. THE FINAL CHAPTER WAS EASILY FORSEEN BEFORE THE ENDING OF THE SECOND CHAPTER. I HAVE TO STOP WASTING MY MONEY ON THESE BOOKS. YE GADS."
1,BORING!,"This is just such a boring book. I didn't buy, because of what the other reviewers said. So I checked it out from my library and boy am I glad that I didn't waste any money. The book started out with promise--especially the hero Duncan seemed gorgeous and mysterious. But there was just no chemistry. Johanna, how could you do this? Remember James & Georgie? Challen & Tedra? Garrick & Brenna? For a long time now, Johanna's writing has dwindled. Stick with her older stuff. Now those were the books that you couldn't put down."
1,Rather disappointing,"This is the first of Johannas' book that I could do without. I think this would have made a much better novela, rather than a full length book. It starts out pretty good, with Duncan and Sabrina becoming friends and confidants. That was all well and good, but the on again off again engagement was a little too much. If Duncan didn't care what the Ton thought of him, he should have gotten a back bone and stood up for himself. If you need a Lindsay fix, reread any of her earlier works. Sooo much better."
3,The Heir,"This book was much better than the Joining--although I feel it falls short of Ms. Lindsey's usual pizzaz. Her last three books have been a little disappointing.It's hard for me to see where where the two characters fall in love.There just doesn't seem to be any chemistry. I'm still waiting for Jeremy's story, and of course the other Anderson brothers."
3,Ok,Not one of Lindsey's best. I have no desire to read rest of the series. I have been very disappointed with her writing lately.
1,awful,this was such a waist of time there was no chase just i saw you i like you and nothing connected plus we were told continuously shes funny and everyone burst out laughing when she spoke but everything she said was silly more retarded then funny at least the mean girl seemed more real as a character!!!boring as hell with a lot of conversations from secondary characters and no romance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Very sweet!,"I thought that this book was very funny, witty and sweet. Although I believe that the characters could have been developed a little better. but despite that fact I just thought this book ws so sweet and adorable. The romance scenes really made me smile, like when they made love in the carriage for the first time. Although I didn't like how Sabrina was treated after that. He like acted like it never happened, although he had some reasons I guess. I don't know exactly why I really enjoyed this book, but I really did. I would recommend it."
2,"So, So....","I was disappointed in this book. It was kinda boring. The story just fell flat. The front title said ""Best Seller', so I thought it was going to be good. I was skimming over pages terribly with this book, especially at the end just to get it over with. I never do that, I usually savor each word. This book was mediocre at best. I didn't like the Highlander accent. The characters were ok. Duncan just sounded like a big Oaf with no back bone being jerked around by his Granddaddys and Ophelia etc. The storyline was ok. It didn't do anything for me. Sorry, I don't know how anyone could have LOVED this book."
3,Good Book but not her best,"I thought this book was a nice story and I didn't understand all of the negative comments about Duncan. I thought he was very interested in Sabrina from the start, he even made comments on how he kept thinking about kissing her, etc but I think he enjoyed being her friend just as much. There were also comments made about him not speaking to her for months when it was only a couple of days because they didn't even place the 3 week notice before the wedding to Ophelia because they had a special license. I thought Duncan was a good character and really was torn about wanting Sabrina. I thought this was a light, nice read."
4,I loved Sabrina and Duncan...and oddly Ophelia too.,"Sabrina is a funny,likeable gal, who is full figured, somewhat dowdy, and has stunning eyes. Duncan is a sexy, young, red-headed Highlander newly arrived to England with a chip on his shoulder. When they meet they form an instant kinship. What starts as friends between a man and women...predictably ends up with a little feel better sex...and whalla! You get your romance...then things get messy. Hearts get broken. People are manipulated. Its great. The saving grace in this story is Ophelia, she is the gal you'll love to hate. A pure narcissist. She stirs things up well and makes up for some what lack of passion between the two main characters. This is a good book because I didn't feel that Duncan was in one way sleezy and Sabrina was just...shall I say familiar to myself? Maybe that is telling too much. Needless to say I kept my fingers crossed for her."
3,An easy light read,"Even though this wasn't one of JL better novels it was still much better that Home for the Hoildays and a few others that missed the mark. Duncan and Sabrina are both likable characters. I especially liked the fact that Sabrina wasn't some fantastic beauty. She was pretty and sweet and that is what attracted men to her not just her looks. The only thing that didn't like was everything seemed rushed. They met, became friends and fell in love in just a couple of days. If you are looking for a quick and easy read this is a good choice."
1,The Heir did not inherit positive comments from me,"The Heir was probably the worst novel Lindsey has written. I'm not a 'die-hard' Lindsey fan, but I must confess that my 'favorite novel list' contain several novels written by her, and I do find her books more than tolerable. However, the Heir did not inherit neither the romance nor action usually associated with Lindsey's earlier novels.Actually, it was so 'boring' that I had to literally force myself to finish the novel.The hero and heroine were 'weak' characters and the menace, 'dear old' Ophelia was obnoxious and dizzy, oh well, as she was written to be. The hero's uncles were just plain 'stupid', the heroines two aunts reminded me of the two aunts in 'Arsenic and Old Lace', and the month long 'search for a bride' party became blase'.After reading The Heir, I decided to read a good old fashioned classical romance to appreciate the fine art of writing.Happy Reading!"
4,The Heir. One of The Best...,"I have to say ""The Heir"" was one of the best books I have read. It was my first Joanna Lindsey novel, and it definately has gotten me interested to read more of her books. It is a must read on my list."
3,The Heir,"This isn't Johanna Lindsey's best. It lacks the passion and the pace of her better works. I had no trouble putting it down. It's not a bad story, but it lacks that special spark. The main characters are likeable. They become fast friends. While the heroine soon falls in love, Duncan sees her as just a friend. She amuses him. Duncan and I don't share the same sense of humor though. While he often found her falling down funny, I found her comments playful but not really funny. The plot isn't particularly complex or fascinating. It's a fine book if you want a simple read that doesn't require much thought."
2,A bit bland,"This isn't a bad book. It's a fast read, but nothing interesting happens. This is strictly a story of finding a friend and falling in love with a silly conflict for formula. I wouldn't not recommend this as an intoduction into Ms. Lindsey's work. Her earlier novels are much more exciting."
2,Poor story,"I just don't get the story. Okay first Duncan is speaking in Scottish accent. It's fine with me until i caught up what ""tae"" and ""ken"" meant. Anyway, the worst part of the story is when Duncan doesn't really care about Sabrina after what they did. Duncan doesn't even talk to her for months! He plainly doesn't love her. On the other hand, Sabrina is crying because he's getting married to someone else. I just want to be part of the story and shout at her--""Get a hold of yourself! He never really loved you!!"" And the worst part is, he proposed to her and she accepted. They WERE just friends, plain and simple. Nothing more."
1,NOT WORTH A STAR,Let me say I have always liked Johanna Lindseys' books however her newer ones are so bad I cant even find the words to describe them. The Heir was so boring I couldnt finish I found myself disliking the hero and the whole situation in this book. The story was complete and utter nonsense. I found it hard to believe that Johanna Lindsey herself wrote this book.( I recomend the Man of my dreams the Malory novels... anything but her newer novels)
2,This book needs more fire!!!,"Johanna Lindsey's other books will pull you in to the story and make you believe that the man and woman in the story are real and alive. I never can put her books down! But, The Heir lacked that luster. The sparring and fighting and romance between the 2 main characters was nill....and these are her trademarks! These make her stories alive and keep your heart pounding for for the turn of the page. The Heir was hard to get in to and I found myself VERY surprised at that. I have never had a problem w/ getting in to the characters and the story - this book was different. I kept yearning, page by page, for the potential to come that I saw for character development but it never did."
5,An Enjoyable Read!,"She has great humor and lightheartedness. Her romances are so fun to read. Some authors put too much angst and sorrow into a romance, but Lindsey does it just right. This is better than a cup of hot cocoa on a winter's day. I loved both fathers in this story and the interaction between them."
2,Boring and Predictable,"I found this book to very predicatable, and in a very boring way. Usually when Johanna Lindsey is predicatable, she is still entertaining, but not this time. For the first time reading one of her books I actually put the book down about half way through because I could not stand to read any further. The characters were flat and uninteresting. I would not recommend reading this unless you are a real fan and read all of her books."
2,"Some writers should just be ""idea"" people","Johanna Lindsey has wonderful ideas for her books. Each time I've read her book's description I get excited! I wonder how the book could possibly be bad with such a wonderful premise. Oh, she finds a way. The one thing that bothers me the most about her writing, and especially in this book, is the inconsistency of the character's personalities. She will draw up a character's personality for you, and then when said character is faced with a decision they do something completely opposite to their supposed personality. I rolled my eyes through this entire book. Not only that, but her historical accuracy is TERRIBLE. I found myself shaking the book and yelling, ""Do some research, woman!""She is hands down the worst author of Regency era books I have ever read. Her ideas are epic, but she should have given them to someone else to write."
3,Sweet Story,"I liked this book, but it was not as good as Lindsey's early books. I thought the love story was sweet, but lacked depth, as did most of the characters. I did like that Sabrina was a curvy girl, but hated how she was called plain one sentence then pretty in the next. What was it! Were her eyes that beautiful? That drove me nuts. If someone has violet eyes, rest assured they are probably better than plain."
2,"Image is correct, Description is not","The image (as of 6/19/08) is correct. This is an 1100mAh battery; NOT the 1300mAh battery as described. Works fine, but I paid a little more than for the battery described as 1100mAh thinking I was getting a more powerful battery. That's not the case. 4 stars for the battery; no stars for the description; averages to two."
5,Replacement battery for Panasonic cameras,Good replacement battery. Fits both the camera as well as the charger very well and holds good charge.
1,You get what you pay for..,"I bought this battery for my TZ5. It fits perfectly, and holds decent charge in the beginning.after a few months of use, the camera started to die when recording lengthy hd-video when using this battery.Now some 10 months later, this battery in drained after just 30 seconds of video or some 50 photo's taken short after each-other.Still, good price, but I guess you get what you pay for.."
5,Just like the brand name,"My Panasonic TZ3 likes this battery just fine. It was real cheap, but it was hard to tell (from Amazon's description) if it was the right part. IT was. It works."
3,"Run, don't walk","This CD features the Ventures first and second albums. The first album features the Ventures biggest hit, ""Walk, Don't Run"". Most of the rest of the album features cover of other people's instrumentals, although there are two original tunes written by the group. The second album features two hits, ""Perfidia"" and ""Ram-Bunk-Shush"". This album features no original tunes by the Ventures. This is pleasant enough music, but most of it isn't too exciting. Still, it's good that their albums are available to their fans."
3,Faulty memory...,"...or, more accurately, refined ear. These are the albums thattaught me to play guitar, and ,for that, I will always love them.But, listening with an ear which has had 40 years to refine itself, they sound raw and unpolished. They are evocative, butface it - this ain't Queen or Satriani on guitar. It's a coupleof boxers and surfers playin' geetar. It is interesting to hearguitar players who started the whole 'music by the common man'phenom, though (I make my living playing guitar because of thesecats), and my hat would be off to them, if I wore a hat. Thanks,guys."
3,cute but small,the boards are very cute but tiny. Best used as a small cheese plate rather than cutting boards.
4,Fiercely amazing,"Moss' work, Fierce, channels every emotion felt and puts it on paper in a way that makes you feel as if you are sitting in a chair, watching the events of her adult life unfold. A masterpiece!"
4,Nostalgia TV,"This was a Saturday AM favorite when I was a kid. I was a bit concerned that memory may be better that reality, but I enjoyed the shows. I was a bit amazed how they crafted the stoies into 14 minutes- no real plot developement there."
4,Great series but only OK copy!,"I was a Jock Mahoney fan and this series is full of action and a consistently great performance from Mahoney. With guest stars like Charles Bronson and Lee Van Cleef plus interesting story lines, YANCY DERRINGER never fails to satisfy. The set has the usual problems that most Timeless products share, occasional sound difficulties of various kinds and so-so but OK images. The merits outweigh the problems, however, and this set is worth owning."
4,Very good series.,Good quality product. Only disappointment was the exclusion of the Yancy Derringer theme song from any of the episodes. I presume there must be some kind of copywrite problem with the song's current owners. Too bad...not having it diminishes the overall value of the series.
4,Great Series,A couple of these episodes I actually remember from the 50's... A great TV show I just wished it had lasted for more than one season!
4,Now I remember why I liked it as a Kid.,"Just the right mix of action, humor and mush. The plots and actions are often implausible, the Hero is indestructable but that is entertainment."
4,Yancy Derringer,Remember watching it on TV and always enjoyed Jack Mahoney in the various movies he was in. This was a good series.
4,Great TV series.,"I watched it in my childhood, must have been ten or eleven years old.I could never forgetthe series, although no chance to find it in Europe, where i live.It may sound strange, but the reason for me to open a Amazon US account, wereYancy Derringer and Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate (Not yet available on blu-ray in Europe)"
5,This the best cd I've ever listened to,What's up my name is JOSE a.k.a puma and I think this is the best cd in history and I recommended it.
4,Laser point could be stronger,"The laser point of this remote is noticeable smaller and dimmer than other laser pointers I've seen. Comparing it to two laser pens that I have (one is smaller than the remote itself) confirmed this. I question how visible this laser would be for people in the back of a large room against a large, bright projection."
4,Works as described,"This unit works great. My only complaint, which is minor, is the actual slide advance wheel. It seems to work opposite of logic. But it does work well."
1,Geography Hoax,"The photos are nice, the quality is good.The only problem with this book is that the author included there a good deal of photos from a different country. I wish somebody told him Odessa is in Ukraine. As well as Crimea.He may check that on any map published after 1954.Maybe he did not notice the border because Americans are allowed to Ukraine without visas. Maybe Ukrainians should have changed that."
2,Russia Beyond Utopia,"I was disappointed when I looked through this book. I am not sure what I was expecting. I might have kept the book if I had understood more of the pictures. I have been to Russia 3 times and I guess I saw more things that I would have included in this book. Russia is far from a utopia and to not picture the every day tourist scenes is perfectly fine, but I guess I would have wanted more explanations. The picture quality however was very good."
4,Good product,"I am, for the most part, pleased with this sandal. It's definitely an attractive shoe and fits well. It did cause a few sore spots in the beginning but wearing a few times took care of that."
5,Nice and comfy flats,I needed a pair of sandals that were dressier than the Birkenstocks I wear daily - these fit the bill. They are of great quality and very comfortable.
3,displeased,this thing is no where near mint condition and the box is just more than torn up.the action figure looks nothing like what the picture holds as well as the written comments about it. very displeased. will not buy from here again.
1,One size does not fit all,"This particular back brace-support is made for men who are no larger than a medium.It does not adjust for waist size. If you're a woman, size large, it might fit.It WILL NOT fit if you wear a men's large, and if you wear an extra large shirt, it will noteven fasten. Not only that, but you can go to Home Depot and find a comparable, highquality belt with shoulder straps in multiple sizes for 1/4 of the price...$14!"
5,AMAZING!,"I love Crosstide, I've been listening to them for about 2 years and they have become one of my all-time favorite bands.In their music you can hear that they have been influenced by some awesome bands such as the beach boys, U2,and New Order but they definitely put their own spin on it and that's what makes them stand out from so many of the new bands out there, they are definitely their own band.I was so excited when this CD came out because now I can listen to them all the time! This is definitely a record worth buying. (you should) Sleep is an amazing song, it never fails to make me happy! I cant wait to hear what Bret, Nick, Erick, Matt and Rian come out with next!"
4,"Clear, well researched. Recommend.","Metzger is a great scholar and he continues to impress with this work as he presents a very good review of the progression from the Ancient Versions of the Bible to the English translations touching on the Coptic, Georgian, Sogdian and Nubian Versions. His writing is clear, not overly technical and well researched. Highly recommend this to those who are interested in matters of theology."
3,Plastic cover reeds,Good sound for jazz. it allows you to hit the high notes with a crispness and power out the low notes with clarity. also does not give you that wood taste in your mouth after playing. last a little longer than the traditional wood reeds
1,The bundle software (onDVD) is an old version,"The bundled software ""onDVD"" is an old version (v1.5), which does not include audio function in it's photo slideshow VCD burner. According to it's website product introduction, it should include audio and photo edit function.The same product I saw at retail store is light blue color, but the one I get here is black. Obviously, it's an old model, and the worse part is, the software is also old version and with very limited features."
3,pretty good,"This is reletively typical Henry Mancini: big vocal chiors, nice, light jazz orchestration, and an easy-listening sound that actually has some subtence. It is sweet, without being sacrine.You will want to get a hold of this if you like Mancini's other work, or if you want to learn what his work is about.I love the feeling, hearing this, that i am stepping into a time, gentler than now, and long gone. There is a gentleness here that is very resonenet and touching.Hearing this is also a great way of exposing yourself to musical textures we have, unfortunately, forgotten about. Using a vocal group, the way Mancini does, was common in the sixties, but now, few below a certian age know this style even exsists. Hammond organs are also all over this record, and we rarely get to hear them used like this.Historical or musical, this is great to hear."
4,Search and Rescue,"After buying the High Sierra Search and Rescue - 7 episode dvd I took a chance, bought this dvd and was please to find a 92 minute version of the movie the series was based on that which was not included on the 7 episode dvd."
1,Be careful if this is for D-Lux 4,"Was shipped as a backup battery for Leica D-Lux 4. It's shape is minutely different enough so that the spring will not pop it out of the camera. Will have to help it out with flat pointy object -- this will require 3 hands. For $21, you can get lots more mAh (shooting time) and a perfect substitute for overpriced Leica ($70+). That's Amazon's BTR-CGAS005-J-006 battery."
3,Remix,Real flavor of Indian classical music is lost in the process.Remixing over-stressed at the cost of genuine music
2,Vernon Girls.........................,"The Vernon Girls never quiet got there. Their sound is rather bland and uninspired....the mediocre material didn't help. What's interesting is that The Breakaways came out of the Vernon Girls...with a thunderous roar! Sadly, that music in nearly impossible to find. The Breakaways had the Phil Spector Wall of Sound...like The Crystals meet the Ronettes meet the Shangri-las. Back to the Best of the Vernon Girls...white bread at it's mildest.....but, a part of the British History of early Rock Music. Forutnately...it got alot better!"
3,It would be a MUCH better book with a different title,"While this work may be ""The Official Guide"" it is a long way from complete or authoratative. It is much more of an overview than a guide. It is an excleent overview or enhancements book for readers with a technical background.I found the book useful as a new DB2 user but what I had purchased the book for was to learn DB2 and it was incomplete for that purpose."
1,Disappointing for a book from these guys,"I bought this based on other books these guys have written, but was disappointed. I could have saved the money and simply read the whats new guide. The whats new guide does not have the examples this book has, but they are not worth the cost of this book."
1,WAY TOO MUCH SEASONING,"I am sorry I bought a dozen. I though I could save some money over store bought hash browns. But the onion taste and smell overpowers the dish.I dumped out half of the first batch because of the strong taste and odor of onions. Then I tried rinsing thw second batch with lots of hot water, hoping to reduce the seasoning; but I could not reduce it.I wrote the company asking them to make available the hash browns without seasoning but have not as yet had a response from them.At the same time I bought a dozen of the Betty Crocker Cheddar Cheese dishes. I hoped we would eat one a week, but they use the same seasoning and too much of it. It was good the first time, okay the second and the third time the smell, which stunk up the whole house for a day, was outright objectional.I signed up for the automatic shipment every six months but cancelled. I think we will have these for a year or more and may give give some to charity, too."
1,not relaxing at all,"I agree with the others who found the tape extremely annoying. It may have had good things to say, but I could not get past the woman's voice or inflections. Just when I was starting to think about relaxing, she would say something so distracting or annoying I was snapped back to the present. I never made it through either side of the tape, but instead, threw it away."
1,Stupidest Movie I've ever seen!,"Too stupid for adults, and definitely not for young children. Too many dope-smoking references, and when fred and daphne switch bodies fred (who is now inside dapne's body) looks down his (her) shirt and says ""Wow, now I can look at myself naked"". Shaggy and scooby were the only characters who resembled the cartoon. All the others have some sort of interpersonal battle or social problem. Don't waste your time. This was just plain dumb."
2,Not As Good As It's Supposed to Be,"I thought that this was supposed to be like the cartoons but when I saw it, it was not as good as I thought it would be. For one thing, Freddie Prinze, Jr. is not Fred. The movie was not that scary and had little humor. While you can sense the friendship between Shaggy and Scooby Doo, their scenes got a little bit weird. As the movie got on, the mystery started to get confusing. All in all, this was not a very enjoyable film."
1,Scooby Doo What Happened to You???,"Yikes, what did they do to this classic children's cartoon? Freddie was the worst, followed by Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Shaggy and Scooby were great, and the computer generation of a 3D Scooby was pretty good. But the entire story of soul-sucking aliens was really stupid. And the worse scene of this movie (among many) was the one where Freddie transmigrated his soul into Daphne's body and got lustful thinking he could look at ""herself"" naked. So grotesque. And what did they do to Scrappy? I always loved Scrappy and how he would boss Unca Scooby around. They made Scrappy into a ... creep. Definitely no good.Bring me the Saturday morning cartoons any day. The movie was disappointing and not entirely suitable to young children, but more for frat guys."
1,Total Ludicrous!,This was a complete waste of my life! 2 hours gone right off the map! Did the Mystery Inc. people suddenly got HYPINOTIZED OR BEANED?? I saw it and immediatly didn't know what to say. NOW I THINK IT'S A WASTE OF BEAUTIFUL TIME! First of all Warner Bros. just grabbed a bunch of NON-TALENTED ACTORS AND JUST WROTE A COMPLETelY BORING AND CONFUSING SCRIPT AND WE ALL HEAR SCRAPPY CALLING THE BAND OF DETECTIVES SONS OF YOU KNOW WHAT! AND LASTLY THEY TOOK A DUMB DIRECTOR AND CREATED THE WORST MOVIE OF THE MILLENIUM! P.U!
5,WASN'T MEANT FOR KIDS ONLY,THE MOVIE WAS DONE WELL.THIS IS NOT A CARTOON. LOVE THE CARTOON.ALSO LOVE THE MOVIE.DOES NOT HAVE TO MEET THE KIDS NOR MOM'S SEAL OF APPROVAL. THANKYOU.
1,I want my 2 hours back,"My 2 kids (ages 3 and 5) thought this was pretty great entertainment when we caught it on Nickelodeon tonight.Me, I liked it about as much as I liked 'The Phantom Menace'. At least I didn't drop $15 to see 'Scooby Doo'.Like Star Wars I, this movie packs plenty of action and stuff to look at, with almost zero chemistry or humor (except for you adult aficionados of fart jokes, you know who you are). Unlike SW1, the graphics here are pretty terrible.To be fair, Lillard (Shaggy) is great and Cardellini (Velma) has the voice down pat and is oh-so-easy on the eyes. But that's not going to be enough to make me watch this again"
1,THIS IS NOT SCOOBY DOO!!,"AVOID THIS THRASH LIKE THE PLAGUE!This is not Scooby Doo, once that all the characters were played wrong! The Scooby Doo cartoons are funny, and this is not funny! This is not even a Scooby Doo movie, this is a movie about 4 retarded kids and a ordinary dog who are involved on a stupid and mindless story. If you want real Scooby Doo stuff, go for the original TV serie and the animated movies that are the best you can find out there! I repeat: THIS IS NOT SCOOBY DOO! This is a thrash movie that was suggested by the original cartoon but the producers of this involuntary thrash got the ideas all wrong! A REAL THRASH MOVIE WITH NO FUN TO FORGET FOR THE LIFE! IF YOU REALLY LIKE SCOBBY DO AND ARE A CLEVER PERSON, AVOID THIS!"
5,Sarah Michelle Gellar Great again,"I bought the scooby-doo2 monsters unleashed 1st. This wasn't available from Walmart when I wanted it.My interest in this is based on Sarah Michelle Gellar. I've enjoyed everything she's done so far. This was better than scooby-doo2, but then sequels seldom live up to the original.It has a PG rating which invalidates those ratings talking about how it will scare small children. And restates the obvious that this is NOT a movie for children.This wasn't written for small children. It's in the same category as the word 'Campy'. It has subtle innuendo, and is aimed at the teen market and older.It was enjoyable for the high quality sets, and story line.I rated this 5 out of 5, and scooby-doo2 4 out of 5."
3,Scooby Doo or Scooby Don't?,"I watched this movie with my little brother last night. Needless to say, he has watched it again since then. What I'm trying to say is that if you are not an eleven year old boy this movie might not be your style. Yet, I still have to admit that even I did laugh at the farting and burping jokes a bit. I guess I liked the old cartoons better where there always was a logical answer to each mystery. It gave you a chance to think. The parts of Shaggy and Velma were the two best actors in the movie. I also loved the animated Scooby. So, if you are looking for an exact replica of the old cartoons, I would not reccomend this movie. But if you are looking for a cute, funny movie that is appropriate to watch with you family I say go for it!"
2,Yuck!,"I'm sorry, but this movie is an embarassment to the franchise. The plot was just too weird and didn't make a lot of sense, although the special effects were great. But the casting was the WORST! The actors who played Shaggy and Velma were ok, but Freddie and Michelle, gotta go. Were they a package deal or something? Talk about over-playing Daphne!"
4,DVD,"My son is a huge Scooby Doo fan and he loves the 2nd movie like this so I decided to get him this one...haven't watched it yet, but for the price how could I refuse."
4,Scooby-Doo on Blu-ray,First and for most I've been a Scooby-Doo fan since I was young. Then seeing it come to a live action movie was something serious. But to review the Blu-ray the quality of the movie is great (9/10) but the only complaint I have is that none of the Special Features aren't in High Definition. But besides that it's cool.
5,Stop making mistakes in your reviews,"...for all the people who really want to see this movie I recommend it. When I went to see it, I did it only in protest. My son is a huge Scooby fan, and I had to take him. I went with the expectation that I was actually going to hate it. I mean only two weeks before I had seen the preview and I thought it looked stupid. Well in I go with a puss on my face, out I came with tears of laughter from my eyes. My son and I were the loudest ones laughing, that's how much I enjoyed it. I can't wait for the DVD to come out, my son is counting the days as I write. It was cute, funny and touching. One movie that I am happy to say I will let my son watch over and over. If your a Scooby Doo fan I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,Do not buy if you want polite children,This movie contains a highly rude and rather long scene of Scooby and Shaggy enjoying themselves in a contest of who can belch the loudest and pass the most gas. I deeply regret purchasing this movie due to the effect this scene has had upon my two young children. I have been fighting and condemning rude behavior ever since...
2,Scooby Boo!!!,"TThis was a bad adaption of the cartoon movie serials. It was much scarier. If you rent it, enjoy the extras but don't watch the unbearably bad film."
1,never got it,"I order this on my phone but I couldn't figure out how to change my address, so it got sent to the wrong address and I never got it. I was ordering it for my sons birthday that was September 15rh"
3,Too scary for most young children,"My five year old granddaughter loves Scooby-Doo, the cartoon so she wanted to see the movie. She had nightmares after seeing this movie. It was a fairly good movie, per se, but too violent for younger kids."
4,Scooby Doo Dvd arrived in time,The DVD came just in time. it was brand new and factory sealed! i look forward to buy more items from Amazon in the future!first time i saw this movie was amazing and hilarious. can't wait to watch it again. thanks Amazon!
5,Awesome Scooby Movie!,This Movie is great its not like the cartoon but its still scooby Doo.I find this movie similar to Scooby Doo on zombie island 1998 Direct-to-Video Movie Which was good.Great buy.
1,Just stick with the cartoon,"I hate it when people make cartoons into movies which have actual people casting. It's just not as good as the cartoon. The one thing I hate the most about this movie is the crappy animation with Scooby Doo. His face doesn't look anything to a real dog's face, it looks like it was poorly animated. It's not like it's impossible to make a dog look normal when it opens it's mouth. If you watch Homeward Bound, you'll notice the animation of the animals' mouths looks good. I also think everything else in this movie is inane and stupid."
1,Scooby Definitely Don't,"I took my kids to see this movie thinking that it's PG and it's Scooby so it should be alright. OH MAN, WAS I WRONG!!! I don't like the way the Sarah Michelle Gellar turned Dafney into Buffy. (She must have gotten her charactors confused.) I also detest the way that they made Scrappy Doo into a preverted foul mouthed villian. I was thoroughly disgusted with the part showing Scrappy Doo urinating on Dafney ""marking his territory."" The list goes on and on and on of all the things I didn't like in this movie, but I'm limited on space. The only charactors that I liked were Shaggy and Vilma, Scooby's animation and voice could have been done much better. Overall I don't recommend this movie for children of any age and recommend it only for adults with a sick sense of humor."
2,Way off,"This movie was disappointing. The thing that is interesting about the Scooby-Doo mysteries, is that there are no such things as ghosts and monsters - there is always some person ""behind the mask"". This movie completely turns that upside-down. In this movie, there is a cult of creepy monsters that exist and suck-out people's souls. This act seemed almost violent for kids to watch. I was horrified that they would take the basic premises of the series and turn it supernatural. My 7 year old was terrified - I wish I had previewed it.I will say that it is worth watching just for the performance of the Shaggy and Velma characters - wow! They seemed like the cartoons brought to life.I recommend Scooby-Doo 2 where there is a classic mystery with a real person behind it and the movie is still full of CGI creepy stuff for older kids.There is also a nice message of being happy with yourself and not trying to be someone that your not."
3,It`s hard to overcome the original cartoons!,"I really felt dissapointed, because as many movies coming from old popular cartoons, the plot was so silly and predictable that you could go to the kitchen, put some popcorn in the microwave, brew a coffee, rest 10 minutes and losing nothing important.In these days, these movies just become a tournament about special effects. Silly and dumb."
5,HA!HA!HA! H...O... HELLO THERE! THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY!,"THE MOVIE WAS GREAT. LOT OF EFFECTS, COMEDY, AND ACTION. THE BEST PART WAS, SCOOBY/SHAGGY HAVE A PASSING GAS AND BELCHING CONTEST.ALSO, THE SCOOBY DOO GANG BREAKING UP ALMOST BRINGS A TEAR TO YOUR EYE. SO, GET OVER IT! YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED."
1,Choke the dog!,"My wife wanted to see this movie, even though I told her it would stink. So I went with her. (WE WENT TO SEE THIS INSTEAD OF MINORITY REPORT!)The movie is just horrible. The acting was okay, but the plot and the story (was displeasing). I thought the actors they picked were on the mark for the characters they were portraying, but let me tell you something, my erudite movie watching friends, if you hate a certain other dog that often frequented the later version of SD, then you will absolutely HATE THIS MOVIE.I don't mean you will disklike it, I mean you will abhor it.My wife turned to me after the movie was over and said.""That sucked.""Never have truer words been said, dear wife."
2,Stupied,This movie is about how scooby doo and thegang solved A mystery and blah blah blah.The only reason I watched this movie was because me andmy sister could not find anything else to watchWell It was A bad idea.It was dumb and stupied A 6 yearold would probably like it.The Reason I gave it twostars was because it was kinda funny in parts and whenshaggys girlfriends eyes turned green my sisterlooked scared so I laughed about that.This movie isok if your watching it on tv but dont buy it.
1,I wish i could do shoot the person who made this!!!!!!,ALL I COULD SAY IS THIS THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!! I mean who would ever watch it? I love the cartoon show infact when I was 6 years me and my parents always watched it every day. Now it is just stupid. Well scooby do dont be sad your just the top 10 worst movie of all time. Maybe it could go to the pile of fire with all the other dumb movies. Like How to lose a guy in ten days or Save the last dance and please dont remind of MR.MOM. So see plenty of movies should get burned. So please dont by this movie.
1,this movie was awful,I tought it would a be great family movie. I am so glad I watch it before letting the kids watch it they would have never went to sleep again. I didn't even like it for my self I was bored.
2,Bleah,"Yeah, bleah. The best way I can put to words my feelings about this movie is to say ""bleah.""It's sorta not ever funny or interesting. It's sorta not ever watchable or entertaining. It's just bleah.I'm also not sure why the female costumes were so scant and revealing, it is supposed to be a kids' film.Sticking with ""bleah"""
2,big dissappointment,"I was looking forward to buying this movie for my two boys ages 6 and 8. I grew up with Scooby, and like them, he was my favorite cartoon character. I ran right out and bought it today and boy what a dissappointment. Their is a lot of bathroom humor in this film which surprised me. It is certainly not the Scooby Doo that I grew up with. My kids loved it, but I think that the film could have done without all of the bathroom humor....it was a bit ridiculous. As I said, it's not the Scooby Doo that we see on TV. Rent this movie before you decide to buy."
4,Enjoyable,"The Mystery Inc gang and Scooby Doo have gone their seperate ways, though a mystery by way of Spooky Island brings them back together. Something's happening to the holidaying college students there, something's changing them. Independently, then together, the gang works to solve the mystery, which turns out to be a little more real, and a little more mysterious, then they'd hoped...It's pretty enjoyable and colourful, even if its not quite the same as the TV series. Scooby Doo is animated pretty nicely and Matthew Lilard is right on as Shaggy. The audio commentary with the cast of the Scooby gang is pretty entertaining too. Interesting stuff. Worth a look for Scooby Doo fans, I thought."
1,"Horrible,obnoxious, violent, not for kids",This movie cannot be described as anything but garbage. It's not even worth describing all that is wrong with it. Don't waste your time reading any more reviews. Just find something else.
3,Scooby-Blu,"A fun adventure, every character was casted perfectly, you can see it when the gang is together, it feels like a group of friends. Now that it is in high def you can enjoy the small amount of special effects that Scooby-doo offers. Overall this is great family film for the growing high definition age."
1,"Just another cash-in movie, 0 stars!!","I just want to forget this movie forever, and continue to apreciate the cartoon itself, 'cause this adaptation is a tottaly disgrace!! It ruins with the name of Scooby-doo, so, don't watch it! Instead, watch Zombie Island, THAT'S A REALLY SCOOBY DOO STORY!!"
2,Scooby Dooby Doo,"The movie is a family hit.I liked it when I saw it for the second time, but it is a little boring. My suggestion for you is to buy the dvd, because scooby is an important character. He's great, fun, and deserves a nomination for best animated.."
3,Much better than the other reviewers give it credit,"If you weren't a fan of Scooby-Doo then you'll be disappointed. If you liked Scooby-Doo, you'll find this movie entertaining. View this film for what's it's worth, laughs and entertainment. It lot's of fun. The pace of the movie is good, with very few slow spots. It's probably one of the best cartoon-to-live-action movies out.Bottom line, just don't take it too seriously or don't too critical and enjoy yourself."
5,Two Thumbs Up,"I didn't know why there were so many negative reviews here but I went ahead and bought for my kids anyway.At first it would seem that the nay-sayers were right on the money, after watching my kids enjoying the DVD so much and over andd over, I had to have a second thought!This is simply a fascinating for the right minds---the kids, actually I enjoyed the movie too, not just once, many times over.Yes, it seems ""different"" than the cartoon version if you are so used to cartoon network. However, after analyzing it over and over, I realized(and my kids too) it is far more entertaining than the cartoons, hence the whole purpose of making a ""live action movie"". The colors, the scenes, the casting are simply great. THe DVD even has some deleted scenes and are nice and fun to have them.Two thumbs up!"
1,Houston Mom,"What, no option to give it *0* stars? Silly is one thing, inane is another and this movie was absolutely inane.Why, oh why, didn't that dopey Shaggy guy release all the *spirit thingies* when he released Velma's (I think that was her name--who knows, who cares)? It could have saved us all at least an extra half hour or so of excruciating tedium.I am thankful for a couple of things: 1) it was a free rental--no money was wasted, only time I will never get back; 2) I wasn't trapped in a theater--I was able to get up and escape every once in a while.I just cannot decide what would be worse: seeing this movie again or root canal. It's a close call.This is definitely a movie for the die-hard Scooby-Doo fans. Believe me, if you are not currently a fan, this movie will do nothing to make you one."
1,The real mystery...,"How can anyone with a functioning brain think that this film is worth looking at, let alone watching in its entirety. I must confess however, I hate Scooby Doo, I've always hated Scooby Doo. But there are a lot of things that I do not like that make good movies.This is not a good movie. Scooby Doo is not only the worst movie ever made but it's probably the worst thing ever created by mankind."
5,daughter loves,My 4 year old loves Scooby Doo and she really likes this version made with real people. I also do not mind watching this movie with her.
1,TERRIBLE.,"Scooby Doo (the dog) looks fake and too computerized in this pathetic and distasteful movie to the popular Scooby Doo cartoons. Scooby Doo-The Movie might be rated PG, but it does contain some gross humor and mature content. That's not to say that it is a totally filthy movie, but it could've been a lot more appropriate than it was. The scene in which Scooby Doo and Fred are having a farting contest (?) is a bit distasteful. Also, unlike the Scooby Doo cartoons on TV, this movie might be a bit frightening to the younger set since it does have some scary stuff in it. So parents have been warned! This movie was just too gross and stupid to be a wholesome family entertaining picture. Sorry. That's just how I feel. It doesn't offend me a whole lot, but as a self-proclaimed family movie, I wouldn't recommend it for families."
1,i want my money (and time) back!!,"This movie was absolutely painful!! My only thought as i left the theater was ""that's two hours of my life i'll never get back..."" Even my 12 year old, who loved ""She's all that"", found this movie horribly painful to watch. A stupid plot, stupid jokes, and a stupid ending made a classic cartoon a laughing stock. The Harry Potter preview was the highlight of the whole experience!!"
1,This movie is NOT for kids.,"This movie was nothing and I repeat nothing to the tv show Scooby Doo from Hanna-Barbera.This scooby Doo movie had alot of cruse humor and clips not suitable for kids.For example,1. The part when Scooby and Shaggy have a belching and pharting contest.2. The very ending when Scrappy Doo was trying to take Scooby's, his uncle, soul.3. Also before Scooby got kick out of the van, he marked his terrotry by peeing on Daphne.4. When Scrappy was in the helicopter, he was cursing.I recommend that you DON'T buy this movie or the second one.Now it's the time when you are going to put negative feedbacks to me.I don't care, it doesn't bother me one bit if you like or absolutly adore this movie. No, I should put it in this way if you worship this movie, that's fine by me.Thanks for your timeThis movie hater"
2,Not so great,"Although Matthew Lillard did an oscar worthy preformance of shaggy (it's very hard to distingush between him and the cartoon) the rest of the cast was somewhat of a bad casting job. I give them credit they did try...The CGI scooby was fairly good technologically wise, but just not quite the fun cuddly scooby from the cartoon. ...Worth seeing if you are a big scooby fan..."
2,The screen writer has never seen an episode of the TV show.,"If the shows creator wanted the characters to be selfserving, nasty, or split up for that matter he would have written them that way. this is a halfway decent movie in it own right. probably worth renting but it should not be called scooby doo. The characters all have the same names and the solve a mystery, there the similarity ends. this movie is a profanity of a good cartoon and i find it offensive that anyone would rape a good show like this."
4,Scooby Doo Does it Right,"A fan of the cartoon since childhood, I have to admit that I saw the movie with mixed anticipation. I wanted to call it a horrible nightmare, to hate it.But instead, I found myself thoroughly enjoying my time watching Mystery Inc back in action! Freddy Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Gellar star along side Matthew Lilliard and Linda Cardellini as the infamous Scooby gang: Fred, Daphne, Shaggy, and Velma. Each of the actors puts forth a great performance, from Velma's intelligence to the almost perfect sound of Shaggy's voice. And Scooby is excellent as a CGI character who interacts with the rest of the cast remarkably.This movie has a few tongue in cheek jokes, a lot of great laughs, and some stellar performances. It's well worth checking out and the audio commentary by the cast is enjoyable as well! Check this out and you will enjoy it!"
5,"From Cindy, NC","I loved this movie. It was a box office hit. I enjoyed all the actors. I actually watch Buffy, the vampire slayer and at the end of the movie Daphne(Sarah) made a comment that would have been a classic Buffy line. I am looking forward to Scooby-Doo 2 and I am planning on buying this DVD."
2,Didn't Like it. Sorry.,I hate to say but I am totally dissapointed with this movie.Let me start that I've never been a really big fan of Scooby Doo but this movie eats the cake as it really does nothing for the original cartoon series from the 1960s.The actings is absolutely clumsy and the script is drab. The whole plot was absolutely ridiculous and forgettable.I'm not saying avoid this at all costs but don't expect anything out of this film.Hopefully the sequel will be better.
1,As a dog returns...,"As a kid I loved the Scooby-Doo cartoons. Lots of good, clean, goofy, spooky fun. Unfortunately, the live-action version lost a LOT in the translation. The main problem is that it's not funny. Not even close. My wife and I kept asking each other, ""Was that supposed to be funny?"" even though we knew the answer...No. The plodding plot exists to allow the cardboard characters to go through their paces and to give the animators a chance to create the bumbling, larger-than-life Scooby-Doo. But this movie chases its tail, unsure what kind of beast it is: a mindless spoof, a monster flick, or a genuine mystery. Ultimately, and unfortunately, it settles on being an undesignated mess. Best advice to potential viewers: Scooby-Don't."
5,Good!!!,"This film is almost perfect except for one thing...i would say some of the scenes like when the ""souls"" come out of people's bodys may be a bit too intense for some younger viewers. But on the other hand, this film directly connects to the cartoon version and is very entertaining. The voices match each other perfectly and the actors are great. Many Scooby Doo fans will certainly enjoy this movie."
3,well.....,"if you like saturday morning cartoons, then this movie is for you. the basic story (except for the egos of daphne and fred) is pretty much standard scooby fare. they go to a haunted amusement park on a creepy island to bust a mystery. whereas the cartoon never really had any supernatural solutions to its stories (the supernatural stuff was stuff created by the villain to scare people away), the movie dabbles in occult mysticism....not recommended for the kiddies. it also deals with soul-swapping, again not recommended for the kiddies. this is more a young-adult oriented film, and it fails there. it's too gimicky to hold the teens' attention, and very dumbed down. the only redeeming feature was matthew lillard as shaggy....no one else, other than casey casem (and he's way too old), could've done this part right. the voice, look, mannerisms, and pure joy of doing the part really shows. he really loves his work and puts his all in every part he plays. rock on matt!!"
5,AWESOME!,This movie is a great movie! Has some scary stuff but is mostly funny. It can also show us stuff that will happen if we don't treat each other with respect! We quit friendship!
1,P-O-S,This is/was a BIG disappointment! I gave it one star ONLY because I had to give it something to complete the review- it is NOT worthy of any part of a Star!!Took it out of the package; the watch was BRAND NEW but already looked worn and ratty. To make matters worse- the Security alarm was no louder than the micro-wave oven. Infact the oven was louder-DO NOT BUY THIS- Put it towards a real device like that duracell commercial touts.
5,amber alert watch,i bought them for my grandkids. their mother loves them. they are easy to use and easy for the young kids to understand. i would recommend them to anyone with small kids and older
5,"Vitality, humor, empathy","Antler is a great poet, one more people ought to know about. He is the closest thing to Whitman--our greatest poet--I have ever come across in vitality, humor, empathy, sheer humanity. His is a distinctive voice. This collection is a little uneven, but you'd better get it before it goes out of print. Thanks to Soft Skull Press for bringing the material into print."
1,Not a great book- don't bother,"First, let me say that I usually enjoy period pieces and try to keep in mind what customs and traditions were like at the time. After all, one reads to be entertained and/or educated, right? With that being said....The only reason I finished this book was to see if the story could redeem itself in some way. I found the main character, Nicholas, to be very self-centered (I guess that is were the title of the book comes from). I felt some sympathy for his wife, Etna, since it seemed she tried to be a feminist during a period of time when women were not considered equals. (Example: it was ok for him to have lovers before they were married, even prostitutes, but NOT ok for her to have a lover(s) before him.)This was the first book I have read from Anita Shreve....I hope her other books are not like this one. I might (and that is a big might) try one of her other books just to see. Can someone recommend one or should I just give up on Anita Shreve?"
2,Utterly pointless,The characters are not likeable. The story is uneventful. This is not Shreve's best work by far.
2,Can you make someone love you?,"No, and to try is not to truly love them. Remember the old story about the butterfly. This is a book I began with excitement as I have been on a feminist literature kick, and this being written from the male's point of view added a nice twist. I like Shreve's work in general, but I soon grew tired of the narrative voice in this work. I continued to read out of loyalty to the author. I grew increasingly unhappy as the novel went on--and maybe that was her intention. It was difficult to sympathize with the main characters, and the setting just didn't strike a chord with me either. Overall, I just didn't like it."
4,All He Ever Wanted,"I found this book compelling, not least because its protagonist is so unattractive. Shreve shows him first as dull and pedantic, then gradually turns up the heat until she has created a monster. Yet our hearts break for this man who wants only one thing, then allows his obsessive passion to overwhelm his moral sense and destroy what he most cherishes. Shreve's books are always insightful, and her storytelling gifts are superb. This is not one of her very best, but it's more than good enough!"
2,Not worth the tedium and unpleasantness,"This is a depressing story, told by an unpleasant narrator. I don't object to such a thing categorically. Obviously the narration was intentionally slow-moving, pompous, and tedious, to demonstrate the character of the narrator. To me, this style just wasn't worth slogging through for the characters, who seemed wooden and one-dimensional, and the story, which lacked impact."
2,"Great writer, but not a good book","I've enjoyed several of Anita Shreve's books, and she's obviously a wonderful writer. However, her approach in this novel guarantees a lot of frustration on the reader's part, at least in my case. The story is told by Van Tassel, the oppressive, pompous husband, and his views are cliched, and consequently just not that interesting. I understand what she was trying to illustrate here - that due to the times, Etna was unable to tell her own story, unable to pursue her true love, unable to have any financial or emotional independence, etc., etc. - and her point is well made, but WAY too late in the novel. I actually picked up another novel in the middle of this one, which I never do, because I just couldn't keep reading. I'd suggest reading her other novels rather than this one."
3,Soames Forsyte meet Nicholas Van Tassel,"One wonders if Anita Shreve was influenced by the recent revival of John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga. (Surely, writer that she is, she has read Galworthy. Everyone should.) For Nicholas seems just as obsessed with Etna as Soames is with Irene. Of course, the stilted language that Shreve executes in Nicholas' narrative makes the tale quite a period piece. But she doesn't have the gift of Galsworthy.Unrequited love, a great universal theme, makes one feel a bit of disgust for Nicholas the smitten professor. His social status certainly doesn't smack of a Forsyte, but his desire for a governess of pecuniary embarrassment certainly does mimic Soames' obsession with a poor piano teacher, both at the mercy of a dead father's poor estate.I enjoyed Shreve's period piece Fortune Rocks much more than this new tome. But this book will probably please those who like a good romance with a twist, a Shreve specialty."
2,All He Ever Wanted,"I complete bore, I continued to read because I thought it would pick up. It didn't. I couldn't find a story that was anything more then a man who fell in love with someone who didn't love him back and never pretended to, he tried to pretend it would come in time, and all he did was loose the daughter that loved him. This isn't a novel, but something that happens all the time in todays reality. I look to a romance novel for fantasy and passion. This had none."
2,Slow Starter,"I couldn't really get into this book. I'll try later, to see if the book grabs my attention, like I do with most books I read."
3,Some what disappointing,"I bought the book based on some recommendations here. This was my first Anita Shreve book to read. I think we all begin a book with some kind of expectation. For me, I was looking to read more a prose type of story; so please understand that after reading my review. I found the writing very similar to a Sherlock Holmes story. I had hoped there would be more emphasis on Etna's point of view, so the letters she had written were a welcomed relief. If Nicholas had ""truly"" loved Etna, would he not let her go? But in (my)reality he did not love her. I suppose the book would've been better if Nicholas's character would have come to that conclusion. Nicholas's character was certainly boring. The incident with Nicholas's daughter was ridiculous. Suddenly, I'm reading something out of the 1990's and was a complete turn off. Anita certainly seems to be a good writer. Based on other's comments, I'm sure some of her other books are better."
1,Very Boring!,"This has got to be the most boring book I've ever read, it's very drawn out. I considered many times to just walk away from it.It may would have been more intersting if the story was told by Etna.From Honeymoon nearly straight to teeange daughter nothing in between.She elaborated where she shouldn't have and didn't where she should have......"
3,Well done... 3.5 Stars,"I really enjoyed these characters and now that I finished the book I'm disappointed to be done reading about them.This is an easy and enjoyable read, it's well written with realistic characters.It is the story of Nicholas Van Tassel, a professor at a small college in New Hampshire at the turn of the century. It's the story of his life as he tells it years later. He describes how he meets and falls in love with his wife and how his desire to be loved by her eventually becomes his undoing. He confesses to us his horrible behavior and the consequences of that behavior. It's always hard to discuss a book and not give too much away...I enjoyed the time period, the voice that Anita Shreve gives to Van Tassel is convincing as are the characters.I'd love for Shreve to write another novel telling this same story from the perspective of the wife, Etna Bliss Van Tassel.I think this would be a good book club choice."
3,an escape,"Need a good escape that is not pulp fiction? Anita Shreve does a credible job of writing a period piece in the language of the day -- you know you are in another era. The story is compeling enough to keep you reading, but it lacks a bit in depth. When you want to just escape into a book and come up for air at the end, this one will do it for you."
3,A Despicable & Pathetic Pair of Main Characters,"It was suggested I read this book since it was written in first person, and I found it interesting enough to finish. However, since I didn't care much for ""Seaglass,"" I began it with trepidation. Ms. Shreve writes a decent novel, but I find it extremely hard to warm up to her characters. They're particularly pathetic, perhaps too much like real life people for my literary appetite. Both Etna and Nicholas have no redeeming character traits, and I found myself feeling sorry for their kids' personality inheritance. I think this book might appropriately be retitled ""Late Victorian Academics Behaving Badly.""I don't think I'll be picking up another Anita Shreve book anytime soon and am considering adding my copy to Amazon's growing resale pile since I don't plan to read ""All He Ever Wanted"" again."
2,Pompous Boring Nonesense,"The plot is so thin- the rhetoric so poor that I wish I'd never opened this latest disappointment from Ms. Shreve. If you want to truly enjoy her talent as a writer search out and read her earliest works.""Strange Fits of Passion"" and ""Resistance"" are examples of breathtaking fiction. Un-put-downable!! This is just not up to that standard, nor was 'Since Last We Met' which was so contrived that I was furious for days ! I hope she reverts to her earlier style at which she succeeds brilliantly."
1,So slow I never even finished,"I absolutely loved The Pilots Wife...couldn't put it down til I finished. This book I put down way before I finished it! It just counldn't capture my interest it was so slow and boring.I won't give up on reading other books she has written since The Pilots Wife was so good, hopefully her others are just as good.Just one little amazing fact...this great author lives just a few miles down the road from me and never heard of her until Oprah Winfrey featured her and The Pilots Wife."
3,Bleak and dreary,"This book is set in a Pennsylvannia college town. It is about a man's obsession to possess a woman, ie all he ever wanted. The main character is neither likable nor particularly interesting. The object of his affection (and there are some rotten puns on that name)is unappealling as well. So what is there to hold one's attention? The writing is deft and accurate, but it is not enough. I didn't like this story. It was very gloomy and self-consciously literary."
3,too much missing,"Though I liked the writing, too much was left unresolved. (Don't read further if you've not read the book). We never learn the details of Etna's relationship with Samuel (either prior to marrying or after). I expected some big revelation that would help define Etna, but alas, it never came...only Nicholas' imagining what happened between Etna and Samuel's family. Also, Etna's final act was not in character...she loved her children so, yet was willing to abandon them? Given her previous acts, and her obvious love for her children, this did not make sense. Another disconnect-if Etna viewed her husband as a ""monster,"" why would she ever leave her children with him? Too many holes to be satisfying."
2,Read Weight of Water instead,"I echo some earlier reviews in that the book has a VERY slow beginning; I almost abandoned it until 2/3 of the way through. The story finally became very captivating and gripping at that point, but it wasn't enough to compensate for the overly long and drawn-out introduction. Overall, I was disappointed with the pacing. But the jealousy and obsessive complusions Nicholas feels are so very real . . . the author's always been adept at realistically portraying our scariest and darkest innermost thoughts. Still, I'd give this one a miss and read her others."
3,All I've Ever Wanted...,"This is the 5th book by Anita Shreve I've read and they have all been fascinating page-turners that couldn't be put down until the bitter end. And, indeed, every one has a bitter ending -- this one in particular. I now realize... all I've ever wanted is an Anita Shreve novel with a happy ending!! I'm a ""glass is half-full optimist"" and I'm tiring of reading these compelling stories about pathetic people desperately pursuing lives preordained to tragic disappointment. Yes, the story is personally thought-provoking. Yes, the author is brilliant. Yes, I recommend this book highly and I really should have given it 4 or 5 stars, but I just can't read any more Anita Shreve until a happier story comes along... Will some reviewer please let me know when that happens?"
3,It's so-so,"Throughout most of this book I had sympathy for the great professor and really disliked his wife Etna for being so cold towards him and never loving him the way that he loved her. The professor only wanted to make Etna happy and pursued her and offered marriage even though Etna made it known that she did not love Nicholas. By the end of the book when Nicholas becomes an arrogant monster, I found that I could not warm up to Etna because the author had made me dislike her so much from the beginning.It's a so-so read, but not one of Shreve's best."
1,Not my thing; I *hated* the officious jerk who told this story,"Man, did I *hate* this book! It's not that it's not well- written, it is, it's being in the presence of the main character. The protagonist, who tells the story in first person, is boorish, arrogant and a monster. Nicholas Van Tassel is an indifferent professor at a small New Hampshire college at the turn of the twentieth century who sees a woman during a fire and cannot conceive of her not wanting him, only she never did, including after agreeing to marry him. Once they are married, this man who can see no further than the end of his nose, nor can he perceive or imagine what people, including his wife whom he professes to love, think or feel."
2,Disappointing at best...,"Having always had a good opinion of Anita Shreve's writing style (if not all of her stories, for instance, I loved A Wedding in December and Fortune's Rocks but was only mildly pleased by Sea Glass), I thought that this novel looked extremely promising. Unfortunately, I simply could not get into this story. Not one of the characters was likeable and everything was so predictable that I was ready to give up on finishing this book before I reached the halfway point.The one redeeming quality of this novel--and the reason I gave it two stars instead of one--is how well Ms. Shreve was able to write from the perspective of a man, particularly a man such as Nicholas Van Tassel--stuffy, priggish, and a bit of a monster in the end."
2,All He Ever Wanted,"I found it difficult to get into this book. For me, the most important factor in a book is the characters. I didn't really like any of the characters in this book. The narrators actions were deplorable. I didn't understand his obsession with his wife. She does not seem worthy of this kind of devotion and doesn't hide the fact that she's not in love with him. While Shreve is a great writer, I just didn't find the story engaging."
2,dark and depressing,"I took this book on vacation to Cabo, but I did not begin reading until the plane ride home. Glad I waited, as reading it there might have ruined my vacation. This is a sad story all around, no joy in any of the characters; I felt sorry for all of them, young and old; a dark and depressing read. Yes, I kept reading because I wanted to see what happened, but just finished it tonight at home and I am gloomy. It will take some time to shake this one off."
4,Shreve has a winner,"Having read all of Shreve's books, I think this is one of the best. Although we know that men fall in love and marry using only their sense of sight, this is pathetic. How this book shows obsession to its fullest power."
4,All He Ever Wanted Review,"This is the second book I have read by Ms Shreve, and I wasn't disappointed. I found that I couldn't put this book down. At times I felt so sorry for Nicholas Van Tassel (our narriator) and at other times I disliked him with a passion.This book is basically a journal written by Nicholas Van Tassel about his courtship and marriage to Etna Bliss. Upon meeting Etna after a fire in a hotel where they were both dining, Nicholas became obsessed with Etna. This obsession lead to a loveless marriage. Etna had many secrets (which in my opinion we didn't get enough answers to in the end) that ended up destroying her marriage and family.Overall I liked this book, I just wish we would have found out more in the end. I felt as if I was left hanging there wondering what happened between father and daughter.I will definitely be reading more of Ms. Shreve's books."
4,Repressed Dignity,"Anita Shreve's ability to parse emotionally laden words with such aching discipline results again in a sparsely-drawn, heartbreaking sketch of two people inexorably tied together in a ""bound-to-be-tragic-in-the-end"" knot. It is a superb illustration of the price we can pay for the choices we make.Olive GallagherAuthor of ""A Simple Path to The Good Life"""
4,All She She Ever Wanted,"I enjoyed this book as I really like Anita Shreve. I continually wondered, however, what Etna was feeling, and what ""she wanted."" Perhaps this will be Anita Shreve's next book. Somewhere I read that this will be a great book club book and I agree. There is so much to talk about."
1,Begged to borrow it--then returned it unread--tiresome book,"The stilted language was unbearable. The pace was horrific. I am a big Shreve fan, but this was a disappointment. I read the first 50 or so pages, skimmed the end. On the bright side, I guess Shreve does a very convincing old man!"
2,She's written better books,"I didn't like this book at all - I found nothing appealing in the main character and never grew to like him nor did I feel bad for the situation he created for himself. That being said, I didn't like the woman he was obsessed with either. I enjoy books that draw you in and make you feel something for at least one of the characters or the story they are telling, but this book didn't do that for me."
3,A decent book,"It's a decent book, but for someone like me I would have preferred a little more detail."
4,"Love it, but back hurts","I love this playpin. I use it all the time. Then only thing is my back hurts when I'm changing the baby. I think the changing pad is too low. I don't know though, it might just be that I have bad posture."
3,Runaway Pack n Play,"This item is fabulous except for one minor design flaw. We have an incline on our driveway and while doing yardwork my husband and I brought our infant out in the pack n play so we could watch her while we worked. We realized there were no locks on the wheels so my husband stuck rocks in front of the wheels. Our older children removed the rocks to throw at each other and the play yard took off down the driveway at an enormous amount of speed. fortunately, there is a speedbump a block away and that helped to stop the joyride. I would absoloutley recommend this item to anyone who lives on a level area."
4,So Easy to Care,"This is the first of the Crowner John books I've read and I'm anxious to read more. The crimes are believable and the characters are so easy to care about. I was actually angry when one of the characters was wrongly accused of the murders. You can tell that the author really researched the period and the location, which just makes it easier to get into the book."
3,Book was great.,"The game was great, wish the movie were more like the book, but I am sure we are not alone there. This game was too short, you could master and go throught the levels too fast, and then a game is boring."
3,Not Prime Prine,"Don't expect typical J.Prine on this disc. This one is a bluesier, rough sounding release that was done at the famous ""Sun Studios"" with Sam Phillips son at the boards. John and the gang sound loaded at times. There's some great tunes, and they definitely had fun, but overall it's probably his weakest effort."
4,Rockabilly,"Some really good songs,but it leaves you wanting more. The sound quality is lesser than other Prine's. I like it, but not as much as about six other Prine's."
1,Over priced and should have been included with fry pan,"I bought the fry pan thinking it would attach like the 1 liter mug. It does not. With this you can use a normal fry pan so what is the point up buying a JetBoil fry pan? So you can cook too hot and burn everything? For a pot of water the JetBoil makes sense because it is efficient. I felt really screwed over to get the fry pan and find I needed an adapter to make it work, and that a normal fry pan would work better. All I need is the top part.So this is a good item I suppose. I give it a bad rating because I am so unhappy they did not make the frypan attach like the liter mug.If anyone plans to throw away the top part, I need one."
1,Do not recommend included parts with purchase,"Its not that I do not like the kit. I am furious at Amazon for recommending I buy this when it comes with the Jetboil Sol Ti. Turns out it comes with any Jetboil Flash or above. I absolutely love my Jetboil, best small camp stove I have ever had, and in fact I use it at home to boil water for tea since it is so fast. My advice is to order you Jetboil and wait on any accessory purchases to make sure that you need them."
2,"Beautiful prose, but not helpful without a complete set of topos and lots of patience","The author clearly loves his subject and goes on and on in prose about the various valleys, never failing to comment on the depradations of the ski industry (a gripe I share with him) but there are few actual route descriptions and no real maps. I live in the alps and have spent a lot of time pouring over this book with maps alongside to try and figure out various trips, but in the end I always refer to other books (the Rother Walking Guides or Summits for All: The French Alps) or simply the excellent website of Wanderland.ch. This book is more for the armchair traveler who wants to read about hiking in the Alps rather than get down to the business of planning an outing."
3,"covers a large area, little detailed information","This is a big, heavy book (too heavy to carry on the trail) that attempts to cover the entire area of the Alps. It has lots of history and natural history, and reading it would definitely enhance one's understanding of what one was experiencing in the Alps. However, there is very little detailed information. The maps are not topo maps, are very large scale, and don't show trails. There are sample itineraries for hiking from hut to hut, but these lack even basic facts like distances between points. The book has a good index."
5,Surreal and eerie......,"Ravi Shankar has during his career composed and arranged soundtracks for serveral films, Chappaqua and a verision of Alice in Wonderland for example. This albumn consists of a soundtrack he arranged for a British art film called Viola. I cannot comment on the film as I have not seen it, it's plot consists of a man's growing beleif that his dead wife has returned as a cat to torment him, sounds very much like an Edgar Allen Poe type of tale.The titles and growing intensity of each track represent the varying stages of the characters madness. Listening to the albumn as a whole with out the film, gives you a window into the delerious and surrealistic world that Shankar has manifested in music so well. The rising drums and feverish sitar playing make for an absolutely brilliant soundscape that very few, if any, musicians could acheive.Ravi Shankar's genius is throughout this music and this CD perfectly complements any collection of his more traditional works."
2,disappointed,thought it would be the entire city but only concentrates on wall street structures.....considering returning this one....but will delve into it further before making a decision
2,This book didn't keep the pace.,"Compared to the rest of her books, Christie did not even try to make this one a stumper. After reading many of her books, a person is easily able to guess the whodunnit in this novel. The character's have distinct personalities and Miss Marple's detective word once again proves useful, but in the end, there is no suspense"
2,Its Just a Packet of Chocolate,I was looking for the great k-cup chocolate. This is great Chocolate but is just a packet...buy the larger container for a fraction of the price and get the same thing.pc
5,Great book and great price!,"This book is one to dream over. I like the example rooms listed with floor plans for sewing spaces. Even if you only have a closet, it shows you how to utilize the features of a closet space for sewing! I have a storage/guest room I want to turn into a sewing area, so this gives me and my hubby lots of ideas on how to do it in the future. I am sure I will use this book to look over and over again. Happy Sewing Room Planning!This book also includes serger/sewing machine configurations. I also have a knitting machine that I plan to put in mine--just adding that table to the room is easy enough for planning--I may just need a little more space. Also, you can use this book's ideas for a quilting area/center as well."
2,nothing new,"This book might be useful for someone who has never set up a sewing room before, but I found most of the suggestions were either things I've long since come up with on my own, or were not applicable to my space and/or needs. Nicely illustrated and showing a number of classy-looking sewing rooms, but nothing innovative here in terms of organization or storage. Wish I'd checked it out from a library instead of spending the money on it."
5,Finally! A sewers dream resource!,"Trying to find articles with photos and illustrations of sewing spaces is amazingly difficult - everything seems to center on home offices or crafting such as scrapbooking. This book has wonderful photos and suggestions, as well as many worksheets that can be used to evaluate everyone's personal needs and available spaces. Highly recommended for the avid sewer or quilter, this book will be a constant source of information, inspiration and dreaming for years to come!"
5,Fix that mess,"I love this book! I am embarking upon the project I've been wating for,redoing my sewing room. I have the time, the money, the ideas but needed some guidance to put it all together. The lay outs in the book range from closet size to true studios. I fall somewhere in between. Hubby is a professional carpenter but needed to see what I need, not what he itches to build. This book could just save our marriage during the renovation. It is a wonderful source of infotrmation and inspiration. Thumbs up!"
4,Inspiring!,"If you need a little motivation to reorganize your sewing or craft space, this is a great book. The photos are plentiful, and there are lots of good ideas for storage and work surfaces, no matter how much space you can devote to it. Let it inspire you to create your own dream sewing space."
5,"Dream Sewing Spaces, Design & Organization","I really like this book. I haven't had time to go through the whole book yet, but what I have seen has excited me. It has a lot of good ideas for storage and organization. Since I am in the process of switching my sewing room from a very small room to my larger guest room, I will be using this book frequently for reference. I do alterations at home, so the section on Secondary Centers was very interesting and informative. Thank you Lynette Ranney Black!"
1,Not such a dream,"I am new to sewing and working to set up sewing area. I thought this would be a guideline book. What it seems to be is the personal sewing rooms of professionals. If I were a publisher of sewing books, I too could have these sewing rooms. I think they have beautiful places to develop their patterns and books they sell to us. I wish they had considered someone who doesn't have the funds to set up these places. The closest they came to my life style was the one under the stairs. Unfortunately, I don't have any stairs. Perhaps they should have gone back to when they did not have a publishing company and think about the closets being used for clothes, not sewing rooms. I will figure out a place to sew, but not with much help from this book."
5,Fantastic Book!,"I bought this book 4 years ago when converting a bedroom into a sewing/craft room. Best book I've ever read on remodeling/building. In fact I still like to pick it up and pour over its pages. Ms. Black covers all the bases, from lighting to colors, walls, flooring, counters, drawer sizes, pegboard ideas. Plus, its not limited to ideas for the person who has a big space to fill. She works with rooms that share office space, guest bedrooms, closets and even a pantry. I followed her advice on color, countertops,insisted on kitchen cabinets and not the dinky bathroom vanity size, lighting and much more - and love my space. I've recommended this book to many friends (but refuse to lend them my copy). Useful for other rooms as well."
5,"A dark, epic masterpiece!","By far E Nomine's best work! The music is pulse pouding yet maintains an epic feel at the same time.This is a great album that no one should miss. And Mitternacht (Track 2) is the most dark and exciting song I have ever heard.Must buy, you will not be disapointed!"
3,"Good music, but...","I like this release in general, although nothing really new under ""their"" sun...well, err, maybe darker ambients and sounds. But if you wanna REALLY enjoy dark electronics within a true medieval atmosphere and, of course, dance and dance until you drop...then you should try better Heimataerde, which is simply superb! Check any of their CDs here in Amazon.com.If you don't know yet Heimataerde, I am almost sure that you will thank me eternally for opening your eyes and widening your mind a bit ;)"
5,E Nomine,"This is an unbelievable CD, full of emotion and full of good heavy beats. The mix between low-guthral (Rammstein like) German vocals and choir (Enigma like) chanting, mixed together with a dash of dark-techno, creats a lovely blend. If you buy this CD and it doesn't move you, emotionally, you better check your pulse."
1,Very Secular,This is another sad endeavor by the Jesuits. Ignatius of Loyola and the early Jesuits were fierce defenders of the Faith and the Holy Father. How times have changed. This magazine is more concerned with the secular realm and appeasing liberals than it is to spreading the Faith.
1,Heterodox,"America magazine is a Jesuit magazine with a liberal Catholic bent. The editors will often give heterodox dissenters room to disseminate their views. If that's your cup of tea, fine, but you have no reason to be a member of the Catholic Church if you can't follow the pope and bishops. Instead, look to the Episcopal church. I do not recommend this publication."
5,Enormous wisdom in few words,"This is a small book, but it says volumes. I read it in two short settings, there's just so much content that I had to allow it time to digest.I don't think I would have picked it up on my own, simply because I've had my fill of the tragic events of 9/11 and the aftermath. I received it as a gift and it came highly recommended. From the time I opened and perused it, I was captivated.I now feel that my own healing process has begun; not only for the events of 9/11, but for other tragedies in my life as well. I feel obligated to say that the author is Christian and the book is biblically based. There was a time in my life when that may have offended me, and I would have wanted to know. However, there can be no greater love than God's love and this is the message of this wonderful text."
4,Interesting,"This book takes a very interesting look at our current world situation. One might think based on the title that the book is about Islam, but in reality this book is geared toward introspection regarding our own relativistic society (and the problems related to it). These problems have been brought to the forefront due to recent world events.I read this book during a bus ride and found it to be an extremely interesting read."
2,Not clear,"I had to read this book for a critical review in a religion class that I took. I thought this book was awful. The author is never really clear on what points he is trying to make throughout the book. He jumps from one subject to another and never gives a good transistion from one subject to another. It appears to me that this author was just saying that God existed and Islam is abusing their religion against us because they dislike the Americans moral system. No, maybe it was that he was glad to be an American, because he ends his book with a story of somebody recognizing that his home was in the United States. I'm not exactly sure is the point I am trying to make. I wouldn't recommend anybody to read this book. I only gave this book two stars because the author gave a good description of how the Islamic people believe."
2,Lil tuna,"I can't think of a worse tuner than this... the only good thing about it is that it fits with the rest of the OK D pedals in their little powered case... this thing has no silent/bypass tuning, the display colors are horrible, can't see anything in the dark AND it has its own mind - useless... need an improved one PLEASE"
3,Pumpkin Spice Costume,"I think the costume is cute, but the wig is needs a lot of work before wearing!"
3,"It was only ""Ok""","Our daughter wore this costume last year. Overall it was cute, but the quality of the wig and boots aren't good at all. The wig was all over the place and wouldn't cover our girl's rather short hair. The plastic ""boot"" covers didn't hold up. The dress was the only thing kept and it is cute."
5,John Prine The Missing Years,"My fiance and I have been ordering and listening to John for some time and this collection is one of his best. We went to a concert of John Prine's in Des Moines, IA and these are some of what he performed then."
3,"Johnny Rotten, Joey Ramone, and Jesus Christ ...","... are three obvious influences here! Young talent escapes an Orange County suburban garage and finds its way on to the shelves. Fast, gritty, ska-punk to listen to on a warm summer night, the Dingee's debut is scattered but contains a few unforgettable bass lines and even a couple interesting hooks. Recommended at full price to 16 year old boys, but certainly enjoyable to all those who can appreciate music."
1,I never received the items!!!,I ordered this product from the seller in June and I still have not received the item even though it is now July 31st. I honestly do not think I need to say anything else except that I just got scammed.
5,There she goes..,"Couldn't agree more with these reviews - I just listened to the CD again today and includes some of the best songwriting ever, including the line about the x-ray machine in There She Goes."
3,"John Prine ""Bruised Orange""","""Fish And Whistle"" 5/5""There She Goes"" 3/5""If You Don't Want My Love"" 1/5""That's The Way The World Goes 'Round"" 4/5""Bruised Orange (Chain Of Sorrow)"" 3/5""Sabu Visits The Twin Cities Alone"" 5/5""Aw Heck"" 4/5""Crooked Piece Of Time"" 3/5""Iron Ore Betty"" 3/5""The Hobo Song"" 3/5""Bruised Orange,"" is John Prine's fifth studio album. Highlights include ""Fish And Whistle"" and ""Sabu Visits The Twin Cities Alone.""Overall rating: Three and a half stars."
4,Adolescent Theories,"Even though, I am a health care professional; my experience included very little exposure to adolescents. This book gave the review and information I needed when a family problem arose."
3,It's a give and take,It's a little wordy and tends to complicate things and not explaining them in the simplest terms. But it's got some good information and I've enjoyed it more than some of my other textbooks.
4,Perfect Fit,"The clock was a gift for my 98-year-old mother who had requested one that was ""light, portable, does not plug in, and has large numbers easily readable at night"". The clock was a perfect fit. The second hand had fallen off and was floating at the bottom of the dial. For my purposes that was no problem, so I opted not to return it."
2,mis-information,Description or product is wrong. There is no quad independent power/charging indicators. They are set up in banks of two. One light for two charging bays. Batteries must be charged in banks of two. Tried e-mailing Vidpro for additional info on this charger. E-mail came back as undeliverable. Cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger.
1,Do NOT Buy! This Product is DANGEROUS!!,"The Power 2000 line of chargers have been woefully awful in my experience. My first one worked for a while, then suddenly the batteries would not hold a charge. This was already a bad sign, since NiMH batteris are supposed to be long-life. Because I liked its compact size for travel, I decided to give this charger one more try. I purchased a current model, the Power 2000 XP-333.Several hours after inserting the batteries properly and plugging the unit in, I noticed a burning electrical smell. When I traced the odor back to the new charger, I of course unplugged it and nearly burnt myself on the batteries, which were scorchingly hot. I fear they might have burst or started a fire had I left them in the charger any longer.There are too many other dependable charger makers -- why take a chance on this unreliable, dangerous product? This product should be rated zero stars -- it's earned a skull & crossbones warning in my opinion!"
1,Disappointing,"After more than 12 hours, this ""rapid"" charger did not charge the batteries that came with it. The charger was also very hot to the touch when it was trying to charge the batteries."
1,Worthless--save your money,"I bought the charger, extra AAs and extra AAAs and NEVER used any of them. The batteries NEVER held a charge. Heck, yesterday, before I ditched it all, I had charged the AAAs for a good 24 hours and the flashlight I put them in barely registered a microwatt of power. And the girth of the AAs was too wide to fit any of the devices I tried putting them in."
1,Disappointment,I agree with Landess in the preface. This book is poorly researched. It doesn't show us the depth or breath of the man. It would not even be poor historial fiction and is horrid as a biography. It's one strong point is Tate's abilitity to show the Southern feeling on their state rights being violated; along with the comparison of Indian rights being viloent by the North.
2,A disappointment,"Supposedly, this is a companion to the workbook of A Course in Miracles; and, supposedly, it's a channeling from Jesus. I have a problem with this because according to A Course in Miracles, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit, has spoken only through this venue and to be suspicious if any other writing says it comes through Jesus. I go along with the latter. Whether or not Journey Beyond Words is bogus, it's a pleasant read."
2,Misses the meaning of ACIM (r),"If you are led by your ego, and afraid to trust Jesus as he teaches you in the Course, you will find this book interesting I guess? Personnally when I hunger for the Course, I read the Course, and when I thirst for water I drink water. I admit that I am not looking for a hodge-podge spirituality, so I may be a bit biased. But please understand what you are saying when you say that the words and meanings of Jesus need clarification. Who would do that-The Holy Spirit, or the ego? Peace."
1,NOT FORMATTED FOR KINDLE!!!,I had to ask for a refund for this kindle book because it was not formatted correctly and the font was way too small and wouldn't allow me to enlarge it. Too bad because many of my ACIM friends had recommended it... but will have to wait for the author to make corrections and adjustments to the format. I'm very grateful to Amazon for the refund.
5,A communication from the Holy Spirit,"This book records teachings received by the author, much as the Course in Miracles was received. It is of similar inspiration and not all that much easier to read than the Course, actually, although it does complement Course teachings by developing some of them. It is appropriate for those who love the Course and who are thrilled by this type of communication."
2,"Good looking, but poor workmanship","This pedal looks great, but the mechanism doesn't move freely (it binds) due to poor workmanship, specifically in the arch mechanism in the bottom of the pedal. I will have to file down the burrs in order to get this pedal to work smoothly."
1,Junk don't buy,This looks very nice it the photos. It is cheap and does not work well. Look else where for a better product.
4,Punk As (....),This band is like the best of Against All Authority but without the ska influence which is the one thing I don't like about AAA.Sloppy hardcore drunken punk rock at its finest. No new-school (...junk) here.
4,Excellent...,Great compilation of Flamenco music. Very sexy. Especially the Alabina song. I'm for sure buying the Alabina CD next. Also great songs from Azucar Moreno and Los Del Rio (they sing the Macarena). Great for dancing.
4,"Great detail, though a bit boring","I had to read this book for an Old Testament class in my seminary studies. It was a great book in that it was full of detail and many verses were used to show the points. However, the sheer quantity of details often left me wondering how in the world it related to the point being made.If you're looking for a great book that shows how Jesus fulfills the Old Testament as well as how he related to it in everyday life, pick it up. If you're looking for a fun read...I'd suggest trying another."
3,music could be better,"the sound from this dvd is ok, but not what you would expect from jethro tull.also, the video editing is a distraction."
2,To Much Noise,"Tha cassete work fine alone with the Ipod, but when you use the charger the are to much noise.Do no buy this article."
4,Way better than FM Transmitters,"The Griffin 9555-TFLEXC works best with first generation Ipod Nano. For 2nd generation Nanos get the 9556-NTFLXAUX. TuneFlex works great if you can plug it directly into the car's stero system using an auxillary cable with 1/8"" (3.5mm) jack rather than a cassette adapter. Only newer car's have this jack, but you can get an Aux cable installed directy into your car for around $100 by businesses that install sound systems into cars.Going through the cassette deck with a cassette adapter only works so-so; the sound is quality is fair. We tried a couple differnt brands of cassette adapters with no appreciable change.Please note that the FM transmitters (TuneFlex IS NOT this type of device)do not work well at all in urban or rural areas; other stations constanlty interfere. Do not buy any type of FM transmitter thinking it will be better than the cassette adapter type. As I said, you will be most happy with a direct wire situation through an Aux cable."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I read negative reviews about this item before purchasing it, and hoped that the negative experiences were a fluke. My experience with this was that the sound quality using the included cassette adapter was horrible. I have one from Sony that I connected to the cradle, and the sound was better, but still distorted. The sound was much better when just using the Sony cassette adapter plugged into the headphone jack on the nano. I returned this item to the seller (subject to a restocking fee)."
3,Download does not include detail,"I bought this to replace my Polar 520 and am quite disappointed. The F55 is a good heart rate monitor, but once you have had all the bells and whistles it is hard to go back. This does download into my Vida-one program but it only downloads the totals, not the actual hrm file. Quite disappointing if you are used to getting the whole file. If I bought this one first and had never had the 520, I likely would be happy with it, but I did not so it only gets 3 stars."
4,Unusual Story,"Very different from all movies that I have watched, I enjoyed the storyline great acting from all the cast. Movie is a classic and that you could notice that by the effects. Still worth watching if your interested in something unusual. I rated this a B grade and some are worth to be noticed for their era. A life form from out of space just let your imagination run away with you and explore the idea of going to dust when they are finished with you, sounds boring but believe me its not that bad it has its moments of suspense but one you can follow so if your a science fiction fan wanting something different grab your bag of goodies sit and relax with feet up and go for it."
4,...was having trouble losing weight,"even with trail riding 85-110 miles per week and spending an addl 4-5 hrs lifting.. was hoping this would jolt my weightloss efforts. It helped some, but not exactly what I needed. It turned out that I was having thyroid complications..."
1,Not a charger,I was looking for a charger/adaptor and this wasn't it. I thought it would charge the camera. I'm sure there must be a need by some to use an adaptor that required you to locate a ( hard to find an electrical outlet when they are out and about) and then shoot a camera with a cord in the way. I just don't share that need. I located this adaptor under battery charger..confusing when it doesn't charge...
2,"Problematic, has contact connection issues",I purchased this item to be able to run on A/C power while viewing pictures and movies on my HDTV. I have tried to hook the adapter to TV and camera and it worked fine until I moved the camera. Then it lost power. It has connection / contact problems. I dont know if it is a A/C (simulated) battery pack to camera body contact or A/C power cord to A/C (simulated) battery pack or and I really tend to doubt that the new cable is defective but it could be. I am going to send this to Canon also as see if they have any ideas on how to troubleshoot/remedy this problem. I am dissapointed. My camera is WONDERFUL though !!!! the Canon SX230HS.
4,"Huffy Bicycles, please modify the rear wheel caps design","It is a sturdy tricycle with an innovative canopy design. I like the fact you can lock or unlock the steering wheel. However, there is a major design flaw. The rear cap that is suppose to secure the rear wheels to the axles is a flimzy cap that just taps into the axle. Horrible design from safety point of view. My son rode for a month, and one of the rear wheels fell off. Luckiy, he wasn't hurt. I bought two axles with nuts to secure the rear wheels from a hardware store. I would recommend anyone who purchased or will purchase this item to replace the rear axles and caps immediately."
4,A great first trike!,"I got this trycicle for my 18 months old because he felt left out watching his older brother going on his bike. The push handle with foot rest and front wheel locking sistem is great! It feels to me like a stroller but for the baby is a cool ride. He loves it and he stays in it much more than his stroller. The only drawback is that it's hard to steer, I have to lift the front wheel and then turn, but this doesn't seem to bother him besides, he's secured with the little seat belt. I agree with shipping cost! Fortunatly I bought this one at the local store."
5,$42.50 for the shipping,"Sorr, seems like a perfect one for my daughter's birthday.But it's for website shopper only and if you really want get it, that will be $42.50 shipping charge on it.( In New York city)And you can't find it in any of Toy's Rus store. So my concerning is, why don't post it for $102.00 or something, then make it for free shipping, make me feels much better."
5,"Great Series - not commercial, but wonderful to watch","In response to the review by ""Big Dog"" - if you want everything to match up perfectly - picture and narration, this isn't for you (personally I think its nice to have to think every once in a while, but hey...)That said, I find this series to be a wonderful insight into parts of China that we never get to see. Television doesn't air documentaries about what you see in these dvds - religious ceremonies, rural life, sporting events, caravans, etc... all in Western China.If you want the flip-side of Beijing and Shanghai, this series is your best bet. There are more dvd's in the Mysterious China Series that I own: Secrets of the Silk Road, Holy Mountain, Kung Fu Masters & Land of LegendsI love them all.Hope this helps!"
3,for beginners only,"A nice, easy-to-read beginners' guide to meditation in a variety of traditions. Accurate in explaining each tradition, with a good use of personal stories to bring in the human interest side. Not for those who are looking for something to take them deeper than the first steps, though.--Alan Zundel, the HeartAwake Center"
2,Unremarkable,"I can't say anything really bad about this book. Ms. Nelson does a fine job of presenting several rather disparate meditation styles from different cultural backgrounds without expressing any particular bias.On the other hand, there's no sense that she found any of these useful or different for her. I would, in fact, feel more comfortable with an entirely scholastic approach rather than this impersonal soft-sell approach.Also, Ms. Nelson seems utterly determined that one can only meditate with an instructor and a group. Bleh on her."
4,"Mellow, modern and very listenable","This soft-spoken Congolese crooner combines soulful, jazz-tinged acoustic arrangements with a similarly modern vocal style, which incorporates strong hints of America's Bobby McFerrin and Brazilian MPB star Djavan. The style may be too slick for some, but it's inventive and consistently engaging. Folks looking for something nice and mellow from contemporary Africa might enjoy checking this disc out."
5,Surpise! I am hooked.,"At first, I really didn't want to watch this series. I thought it was going be a waste of time. It appeared to be mass produced and liked by the younger pre-teen age group.I picked it up and set it back down. Never really sure if it would be anything worthwhile. But curiousity took over.To my surpise, I enjoyed it. It was very funny. It has a great sense of humor. Very good storyline and plot. It was well done. It was one of the best anime out there."
3,Dancing Pandas? What were they thinking?,"I first got this tape because I loved the comic book. However, I don't remember any dancing pandas in the comic book. The pandas are only in the theme song, but that's still one time too many. If you survive the theme song, you are then treated to some of the great comedy from the comics. However, those who've read the comics will notice that much of the best stuff is missing. Also, even though this whole tape is based on the first volume of the comics which had 14 episodes, this tape only has the first four crammed into two episodes. One good point is that this is cheaper than the DVD. For those who expect the whole comedy of the comic will be disappointed, but for cheap beginners this is a good start."
3,Quality is good--Very Over Priced Though,This is a very good quality product that is packaged well. I want other consumers to know that the picture looks like a significantly larger than what I really is. This isn't much bigger than a can of soda.
5,Pirates Aboard,The book captures individual experiences of different cruisers in different areas of the world and reveals what they learned from their experiences and shares this with the reader. If you are considering cruising it is well worth the read.
2,Anecdotes,"This 2003 publication contains a series of examples grouped geographically. The final chapter offers practical advice to ""Bluewater Cruisers."" Its too old to discuss the current Somali pirates, but it does have some interesting cases of Somali piracy from 1999. This would be well before Somali pirates were regularly making the news and collecting multi-million dollar ransoms. It does give a very good flavor of what modern piracy and pirates are like.The ""practical advice"" reads like a list of things the author was told during interviews with captains and crews of ships. While the advice is sometimes helpful, it is not a detailed discussion based on empirical evidence.Another shortcoming with the book is a lack of an index. This is not as dramatic of an omission as it could have been since the book is generally well organized."
3,Had to buy this for a class,"School is 4 nerds, books are 5 nerds, I can't believe I actually had to buy this. Is it a good book? Well, I don't know, I didn't read it. Theoretically it could be greatest or worst book ever since you and I haven't read it yet, only 1 way 2 find out tho."
3,Book is suck.,The book is suck. The book describes all techniques in first chapter at once and too many complicated examples. Should have been wrote clearly step by step. I don't think it is a good book for students.
4,Echoes of Pinocchio,"I can't pretend to know too much about Anime -- or even this film, for that matter. However, ""Tree of Palme"" is a beautiful, confounding, work of art. The animation is superb, blending computer-aided effects with traditional cel animation in a tale that feels epic and urgent. The plight of the robotic boy elicits genuine sympathy, and the allusions to Pinocchio make the film feel familiar, even when the backdrop and plot become a bit convoluted and foreign. I am very pleased to see this film receive U.S. distribution, and I look forward to seeing it again."
3,Akiko Hiramatsu has got nothing on Hayao Miyazaki,"The animation was good, the imagery was good, although not totally original, however the movie is too long, boring, confusing, and over the top dramatic. So many characters in this that has nothing to contribute with the plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn't one of them at all, it would have been better as a short series. This is a Pinocchio rip off.If you want to watch a anime movie with good animation watch these: (Akira, Voices of a Distant Star, Spirit Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke, Steamboy, The Place Promised in our Early Days, Metropolis), and more."
5,Recorders,I wanted to have fun with my grandchildren while teaching them music notation. This was a good way to start. The 8 year old loved it. The 6 year old was a bit too young.
1,Bought two and neither will hold charge after 3 months.,"I bought two of these batteries and they worked fine for a vacation which we were going on in July. The camera is rarely used, but it never fails that when we need to use it the battery has lost all charge and we can only get it to hold about 10 minutes worth of charge. We have slowly seen it decrease from a great battery in the first month to ""where lucky if we can get 3 or 4 pictures in before it dies..........and that goes for both of them!!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT,This product is just great. I've been taking it for about 2 years now for my severe carpel tunnel and it's working wonders.
4,Cool movie,"This is a fun and creative look at dragons. Many say that all stories have a seed of truth in them and that all these dragon stories didn't come from nowhere, and this movie gives us a look at that. In this movie, dragons existed in the Middle Ages until they died out - most of them, anyway. It is now modern day, and the dragons have made a comeback, and these creatures are NASTY and hard to kill - hence the title of this movie. Fun movie especially if you like dragons."
3,Ok,This movie was ok and had cool effects and a good cast. Gerard Butler had a small part in it but Christian Bale was in the whole movie. Overall it wasent bad but I wouldnt watch it on a regular basis. About 2 times is all I can watch it.
4,Watch it for Gerard Butler as Creedy-------,"Dragons!! They look like just what the are - drawn onto a screen like cartoons!The story is okay in a dark, fantasy kind of way. The only reason I would ever see something like this is to follow the career of one of its' stars. In this case, Gerard Butler.He plays the most human and natural character in the film, Creedy. Cracking wise with Christian Bale, interacting with the children of this dark, unpleasant place, and doing the hero that takes the ultimate risk, he is lively and interesting. I wanted to know more about his character. But, what do we get? Bale and his two expressions. Dour and dourer.And then there is Matthew McConaughey and his odd super-dooper nut job. Strangely, I enjoyed watching him more than the boring Bale. At least Matthew did crazy well.In fantasy films it is best to go in with your disbelief in check. A good one will just carry you along for the ride. This is not a very good one.But The Butler is worth a watch. 6/10"
4,Guilty Pleasure,"OK...so this isn't exactly Shakespeare or CITIZEN KANE, but REIGN OF FIRE is great fun. I really enjoyed the burnt-out, ashen atmosphere of this post-apocalyptic world, the gritty people, the castle ruins, and the lack of color. Christian Bale was a very sympathetic character, and Matt McConaughey is at his over-the-top best. This isn't the ... heartthrob I hated in romance movies like THE WEDDING PLANNER; here he's buff, tattooed, bald, and really PO'd. He looks great, and his character is definately someone to cheer for, as you can tell he's playing his machismo down with some sly tongue-in-cheek asides. I also appreciated that this movie was pure action - there was a pretty girl in the cast that could have led to a really cheesy love triangle, but it thankfully never happened. The dragon FX are the best I've seen. So, if you're looking two hours of watching things blow up real good, you've found you're movie here."
3,dragons galore,"the beginning is ok but the rest with the dragons high in the sky and the action puts this one to place. this one is hot, hot , hot and can McConaghuey be any balder or buffer. Bale is great as always. better dragon movie then Dungeons and Dragons"
1,Utter Rubbish,"The true tragedy is that I paid to watch this film in the cinema - what an unbelievable disapointment. Somebody should blacklist the director for actually managing to put people off going to the cinema. This should have been straight to video or maybe even cable. The only people who like this type of purile drivel are non-science fiction fans. I hate it when films are over-hyped to appeal to true genre fans but when you turn up you get a super-thin plot, bad acting, awful CGI, characters you really don't care about and 20 seconds of action.Remember, just kill the main dragon and all the others will die too. Its simple. [sound of me puking up...]"
4,Awesome Movie,This movie is really great. The dragons are the best since vermithrax in Dragonslyer. Dragons are meant to be mean not friendly and these sure portrayed mean!! I was dissapointed in the way this film was recieved and it's box office take. I think Bowman did a great job.
3,not bad despite the negative reviews,"Many people felt the need to trash this movie just because it didn't have dragons in every scene. While there are better dragon films, Reign of Fire had some good special effects to it. There are a few points of intensity,the violence factor isn't too heavy (otherwise this film would have received an R rating), and the ending seems a bit mediocre but the movie is still worth a look."
5,Gotta See!!!,Awesom graphics and CGI... You will see Matthew and Christian in roles you wouldn't expect. It is a must see.
2,Better title: &#65533;Reign of Special Effects and Little Else&#65533;,"I hate to say it, but it was the flashy movie poster with tempting imagery of fire breath dragons demolishing London that drew me to this movie. Unfortunately, the first few moments told me that I wasn't going to see what I expected. In fact, the most you see of the dragons themselves are often shadows or brief glimpses. When you do see them in full view, the special effects are quite good. But I've seen much better. The story had too many plot-holes. The script was really lousy. The actors did what good they could with what they had. The best part was when they made fun of ""Empire Strikes Back"". For a good dragon movie see... come to think of it, no good dragon movie comes to mind."
4,"Dragonslayer, Part II","When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was reminded, as was the ... reviewer, of 1981's ""Dragonslayer"". After having seen ""Reign"", I am sure that this is life an extension of the former film.Let's just say that one of the offspring of the dragon slain by Peter MacNichol in the earlier film had survived, existing in the caverns underneath ""merry Olde England"". It was then ""awakened"" by Alice Kringe and crew, brought back to wreck havoc on the Earth.Thus, this set up for this film allows McConaughey, Bale, and their respective motley crew to do battle with the progeny of this creature.There are some lapses in logic and the dialog is rather wooden, but the film is still a pretty decent way to spend an afternoon.Hopefully, the theater is well air-conditioned...'cause the dragons in the film are HOT!"
2,Written in Crayola!,"There was no point in coming up with a plausible biological reason for Dragons ""breathing"" fire if nothing else in the script after the opening segment was believable.""Atlanta native"" has listed some of the more obvious plot holes in another review.Sadly the most interesting part of the script is the portion they chose to do as a series of Magazine and Newspaper clipings rather than as the movie.Even the CGI dragons, while possibly well designed, are poorly rendered.Most of the time they are obscured by clouds , flames, or camera moves.If you like dragons wait for the video.You'll be able to fast foward through the ludicrous dialogue."
3,"Nice flick, but...","I liked this movie, fast paced and well done, dragons are believable; I just have trouble with the overall premise, dragons taking over the world? Anyway, suspend disbelief and enjoy..."
3,Sick day rental at best,"Reign of Fire had so much potential and a great new story line that I was looking forward to how it was displayed on the big screen. Figured there were some good actors, special effects- this was going to be good.It wasn't. Matthew McConaughey was horrible. He delivered lines like he was pretending to be a pig in labor- all grunts and couldn't understand a thing he said.The action was mediocre at best since you rarely if ever get any scenes of the dragon! They are few and poorly done. If the lack of dragon scenes was to inspire fear/curiosity through anticipation it fell flat- looked to me like the budget ran short so they couldn't have too many special effects.I wish I had better things to say, but this is a slapped together B film that is may be worth a rental on a sick day. Not worth a purchase or the[money] bucks I paid to go see it in the movie theater."
3,Awsome movie,"Great special effects, ok acting, explosive action, and a bald Matthew Mconoghey! Not to mention the dragons, which were impressive, even though they mostly barbecued the people rather than eating them. And i did expect to see the battle between the Apache helicopters and the dragons. But, for the most part, the movie was great. Highly recommended."
1,I'll be generous and say one star.,"The plot was an excellent idea. How it was done was not near excellent. Reign of Fire seems to be more concerned with nice looking CG of dragons breathing fire on defenseless civilians than anything else.The movie is basically entirely filler; the only real thing that happened was the climactic moment at the end, which wasn't terribly exciting anyways. The lines are not atrocious, and the acting isn't badly done, but the movie has so little actual plot content that it barely deserves one star."
2,Lots of potential... WASTED.,"The trailers led me to expect a mighty man-vs-dragon battle of epic proportions. Stupendous effects, a clever premise (the dragon hibernation cycle and raison d'etre), and good British talent, all could have made for a very entertaining piece of film.Instead, I wasted 3/4 of the run time watchin the development of two or three characters. The dragons, and the setting in which they've placed the cast, becomes secondary. I have nothing against character-driven stories, however, this movie failed to convincingly deliver such a story. And the attempt to do so required the sacrifice of a lot of potentially impressive battles.In short, this one delivers the unexpected - in a displeasing fashion."
2,If only the DRAGON had won...,"... Now audiences are presented with something called REIGN OF FIRE starring Christian Bale (who is fine casting) and Matthew McCaughnahay (who seems to chew his lines as much as he enjoys rubbing his bald head and chews his cigar). Too bad for the dragon. He has little to do. While the adds made this film out to be like BLACK HAWK DOWN meets DRAGONSLAYER, the actual plot is a total letdown. The effects are good. The 'castle' is a reject from some old ROAD WARRIOR film. And the supporting cast are simply in the picture to become toasted weenies for the dragon's breath. The lead female is wasted unless you enjoy just watching a pretty face and nothing else. I love a good dragon story. I love dragons. They are the flip side of the unicorn. Bad vs. good. Dragons fascinate. ..."
2,Huh?,"That one word just about sums up the whole movie. Christian Bale did some excellent acting and Matthew McConaughey looked good, but that's also about all there is to say. The director or writer, or whomever was in charge, could have done so much and gone in so many directions, but they did not. I thought, while watching the film, WOW, what will happen next?! Unfortunetly though, the movie was predictable and the plot went nowhere.The few good things I can say, are that the special effects were amazing, and like I said, Christian Bale did an OUTSTANDING job acting.So please, save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD or video."
3,great dragon...,"I enjoyed the movie. The special effects were awesome. I think it was a little too technical trying to explain the dragon, and the procreation speed is unbelievable as well as humanity's response as a whole, but the dragons are cool and the efforts shown to defeat them equally impressive. I think the movie could have been longer, and there could have been more character development, but it was certainly worth the matinee price and the movie does benefit from the big screen."
3,scene on posters is not in the movie,"After weeks of seeing London burning in the midst of an all-out dragons vs. helicopters battle on the movie posters (and billboards, and official website), I was disappointed that this scene wasn't even in the movie--not even close. To mention all the points that are wrong with this fantasy image borders on spoiling details of the film, so all I can say is it is a fun movie nonetheless, but don't expect what you might expect from the promotional artwork ."
4,A cheapie but fun anyway,"Wasn't made on a big budget ,that's pretty obviousBut hell if you have an hour and a half to kill you could do a lot worseWith the rate of remakes being done now it won't take long to be re shot"
4,"Decent movie, but back desc is deceptive","I went into this movie having known nothing about it but what the blurb on the back said. The blurb gave the distinct impression of damsel-in-distress gets rescued....which this movie thankfully avoids. The plot is so basic it could have been written over breakfast one day...the dialogue is so so, the special effects are decently done, the overall package is nice and short. In truth, the movie pulls very few surprise moves which is refreshing. The characters aren't super developed but they've got a bit of life and backstory to them.For an end of world type movie, it did all right in my eyes."
2,Could it have been any lamer?,"Spoiler warning. It's hard to believe how lame the premise of this movie was. Dragons reappear and lay waste to civilization at its peak. But now that there's hardly anybody left, we discover that all you really need to do is kill a single dragon. Because there's only one male. These things have been around since before the dinosaurs, they've outlived everything, and yet there's only ever one male? A single illness or accident would have destroyed the species long long ago. That's such a contrived excuse for a solution I'm embarrassed for the people who wrote, directed, and starred in this. It could have been an interesting story. But that's just pathetic. You get 2 stars for special effects."
3,At least there's the rewind and pause button.,This movie is entertaining but I expected more. . . more screen time with a shirtless Christian Bale. He's an excellent actor but my God that body. If you're hot for Christian Bale this is the best he's looked-dirt and all.
2,Total Action Porn,"Need a plot? There really is no need for you to watch this film. ""Reign of Fire"" cashes in on the type of audience that measures film satisfaction in number of explosions per minute and that oh so hip post-apocalyptic feel.The movie has some great special effects and some interesting camera angles. That's about the best that can be said for it. If one begins watching the film with that sort of thing in mind, there will be no disappointment. The script? Minimal at best. The acting? Feh. Matthew McConaughey is the absolute worst. Horrible. One can't possibly say enough how annoying his character is, and his over-acting makes Mel Gibson's efforts in other films seem subtle and understated by comparison. Christian Bale is just not quite there.Still, ""Reign of Fire"" can be a fun film, as long as one expects nothing more than lots of mindless action with little to no point."
3,Flame Retardant,"Above average film starring Christian Bale and Mathew B. High def is gorgeous and you can't go wrong renting this flick, or blind buying it if you never saw it."
2,No Fire in These Dragons,"""Reign of Fire"" is the worst kind of movie. It doesn't have the decency to be bad, just mediocre. You don't leave the theatre discussing how bad it is, you just leave stupefied like you just had a meal from McDonalds. A recent example of this type of film is ""King Arthur"". The film basically concerns a recent future where a plague of dragons has laid waste to England and a group of survivors led by Christian Bale. A band of American commandoes led by Matthew McConaughey arrives to assist in the dragonslaying. No pun intended, sparks fly between the Brits and these interloping Yanks. This movie is not so much directed but filmed. The actors here don't embarrass themselves but they don't really distinguish themeselves either. Ho-hum, the special effects are adequate. To make matters worse they didn't even bother to obtain the rights to the Johnny Cash song that the title of the movie derives from. Um...never mind."
1,"...poor film, little kids might like it.","This movie was poorly made, the only thing that prevented me from walking out was the CGI dragons. The acting is bordering on indie films and the scenery is the standard apocolyptic cliche, albeit the castle they live in. Several plot holes easily distract viewers from the (thin) storyline and dialog. Thinking back on it, I'm not sure any emotion was played out until the last minute or two of the film, and much of the action was standard stuff as well ... this movie was more like a D&D Mad Lib than a hollywood movie. Asides from the decent looking dragons (admittedly they did pull a few stunts to ease their jobs as animators, such as clouds and speed blurs) this movie [is bad]."
1,bad movie,"The movie sucked. The story line was awful. The actors were ok, but some of them..... no. The movie was way too fake, and like i said early on that the story line made no sense. This is my advise.............. DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!! waste of money :]"
3,Actors give earnest effort but movie is a mess,"I had high hopes for Reign Of Fire, but in the end, the movie is a mess of choppy sequenced shots and plot and little action with the dragons. The trailer pretty much gives you all of the action with the dragons. The rest of the movie is bits and pieces of apocolyptic fare that seems to have taken a page from Mad Max.I am giving the movie 3 stars only because the stars, to include McConaughey, put forth an earnest effort, but in the end, their performances could not save this beast from burning out."
1,Reign of Fire,The last part of this movie would not play and it had glitches throughout the movie. Wasn't real impressed with this one!
1,Drag.on & on,"If you love fantasy, dragons etc. then ok RENT this movie first before wasting good bucks on buying. Previous comments, bad plot, ham acting etc all true One of the all time great BAD fantasy movies."
5,A dark and riveting sci-fi thriller.,"Reign of fire was an excellent film. The cinematography was near perfect, and the special effects were breath-taking. Its not a movie that everyone is going to like because it isn't very uplifting to see the human race stomped out to near extinction. However, it is suspenseful and has a few suprises along the way. The method in which the dragonhunters go about killing a dragon with all the high-tech computer equipment was fascinating. The plot is somewhat thin, but it shows how boring the lives of humans became when they were forced to live in refuge and fear. It needs to be in every sci-fi fan's DVD library!"
4,A Exceptional Entertainer,"If I had to pic one word to describe this movie: adrenaline. The movie is a typical post-apocalyptic, fight-for-survival film, with the obvious moviegoer draw being the dragons. As far as the plot is concerned, it is riddled with inconsistencies and bites off more than it can chew as it tries to explain in technical terms how the beasts multiplied so quickly. When all is said and done, what you have is an entertaining story, characters who are sterotyped incredibly, and a virtual feast for your eyes and ears.If you're looking for a true, believable fantasy/sci-fi movie, I wouldn't recommend seeing this. However, if you can get by the watered-down plotline, the film is full of cliche characters who do not fail to entertain and a landscape that draws you in whether you like it or not. When you walk out of this movie, you'll be on the edge of your seat for days."
5,great movie,This movie was really good. My children enjoyed watching it..would definitely order it again and will order from this company again...received quickly and was very pleased..thank you
4,Not bad at all,"It's a good B-movie. Bale and Matthew give good performances. The sequence of the jumpers is amazing, one of the most creative I've ever seen!"
4,Unexpectadly Believable,I didn't know what to expect when I first bought this movie but after watching it I was unexpectably suprised. To bring the genre of a midevial dragon movie into this day and age seemed kind of nonscensical. Once you start getting the picture of the story it seems like a plausable situation. The special effects were great and Matthew McConaughey played a perfect [guy] who stole the movie. Christian Bale and the rest of the cast played their parts to the T. I don't know what most people might expect from this movie but I can be sure if you buy it you be both suprised and pleased.
2,Five-year-olds have better imaginations,"I predict this film will one day become one of those ""so-bad-its-good"" movies. Thirty years from now audiences will enjoy watching just to count the number of plot holes and idiotic inconsistancies, laughing they're heads off. The first dumb idea to kill the suspension of disbelief is the realization that the nations of the world, equiped wiith air-to-air heat-seeking missles mounted on supersonic jet fighters, couldn't kill a bunch of slow-flying reptiles. But, miraculously, twenty years later, after the world is burned to ciders, a handfull of humans bring down dragons from a single helicopter using skydivers carrying - get this - nets! Later on the dragonslayers get even more retro and go after the head dragon with - get this - crossbows and arrows! Give me a break. This would have been a much better movie had it been a typical knight vs. dragon film. The futuristic stuff is silly. Someone please stop Rob Bowman before he directs again!"
3,"Lots of dragon action, little plot to follow.","Reign of Fire starts off well, with a scene that pays nice homage to another british apocalyptic thriller, Quatermass and the Pit. Then it stumbles, glossing over the end of the world and getting to humankind's Last Stand. Rob Bowman creates some nice X-Files style atmosphere and some rousing action scenes, but there is precious little story to hold it all together. Not that one watches movies like this for the story, we want dragons blowing fire and humans kicking dragon tail. On that level the movie delivers the goods. Matthew McConaughey makes for a nice pseudo-Quint dragonslayer, but Christian Bale, with his shaggy hair and beard and constant looked of pained shock, too closely resembled James Brolin in The Amityville Horror for me to loose myself in the simple story. Nice for a rental, but nothing worth owning."
3,Entertaining to an extent.,"Reign of Fire has good action, great special effects, and fine performances, but there's little else about the movie that stands out. It feels a little too small-scale given the premise and it never delivers the all-out action it seems to promise. For more enjoyable post-apocalyptic action with Christian Bale, check out Equilibrium instead."
1,Only fire of choice should be the director,"Although hyped and attractive through the trailers, this film falls completely flat. The most wonderful aspect of this film is the brief display of the dragons' prowess to destroy and the one initial sequence of a dragon capture and kill. Other than these aspects, there isn't any redeeming value to this film. The films begins with the uncovering of the sleeping dragon, then morphs to the post-apocalyptic period with the human race barely surviving in a dragon dominated planet. The script has so many hole in the design, it is very surprising that the script was not mistaken for swiss cheese. So many questions left unanawered ...Why have the dragons so dominated the planet? When the planets population became so devastated, how did the dragons continued to survive?..on and on. This film rightfully earned the right to receive Howie worst rating of one star."
4,A curious but effective movie!,"I have to admit the movie engaged me from the first shots. A child goes to the core of the world to find a devilish monster emerged from the entrails of the ground. A dragon in the purest sense of the term. Since his mother will die at that awful encounter, he will become the furtive avenger. But in the meantime, these dreadful beats have increased in number terrifying and devastating the human race.Just a handful of brave men will pursue them in order to exterminate them. Soon they found out the key of the problem, that eventually will lead them to the final victory.Tense and absorbing along the road."
5,Awesome,the special effects are second to none. I mean the dragons look real. I couldn't tell if the effects were computor generated or if they used models. I don't know if the special effects artist team got an oscar for this movie but they should have. The effects were that good.
5,reign fires,Great movies and great acting..a tour de force. Fire dragons are great too. What more do you want. See this movie.
3,Ok Movie,"This is what I call a good popcorn movie. Bale does a good job, as does McConaughey, but the story and script are weak. This a good movie for a rainy day. The movie is ok, but no great."
4,Hell of a movie!,"Was an awesome movie,Matthew Mconehey at his best before all the chick flicks! Christian Bale was great as one of his first few movies!"
2,Yawn.,"A typical sci fi plot mixed with decent acting and a script too boring to carry out long, I was half way asleep 30 minutes into the movie. I didn't snap out of my daze until 20 minutes to the end when the action finally kicked in instead of mindless babble between the main characters about how they are going to kill the dragon instead of actually trying to do it. Incredibly mediocre and nothing worth your money. Skip it.C-"
3,"Rated PG-13 for ""Pretty Good if You're 13""","This film had its strong points and weak points. I think the question on people who have seen this movie's minds is ""what is the point of this movie?"" The dragons were very real-looking but were not in enough of the scenes. I find it hard to believe that in 18 years from now, our world will be taken over by dragons. What about those plot holes? Where did that Van Zan guy and his crew fuel up? Matthew McConaughey's (The Wedding Planner) character needed some work. It wasn't his best performance. Izabella Scorupco's(Vertical Limit) character comes into the movie as a dragon-slaying helicopter pilot. Christian Bale's(American Psycho)character was sympathetic. He did a good job with the emotional scenes. Matthew McConaughney doesn't need to be so breathy when he speaks. All in all, I give thie movie 3-3.5 stars. Its action scenes are worth going to see the movie for but don't expect much more than that."
5,Mad Max meets Dragons,"No this is no Oscar winner. But for the sheer imagery of the dragons it kicks. I had see the previews for 3 months and I could not wait for this movie to show up on the big screen. I got to see it on an Ultrascreen and was not disappointed one bit. Matthew M really played the part of an over-zealous dragonslayer with perfection; his chawed off ceegar and shaved head further conveyed his madness (and his beefed-up bod was easy eye candy!). His madness equalled the character of Mad Max. Quinn tho handsome was a bit washy but showed his true colors in the end as the boy who saw the dragon's release to the hero 20 years later. This is an eye feast and as my movie companion commented last nite, ""Intense, man!"""
4,"Great DVD, Great Movie!","I have to admit, I thought that this movie would ....I thought it would just be another monster movie (with dragons).I was surprised by the fact that it was actually good!The plot is actually decent, the acting is good (bale and Mcconaughey are great)and direction and special effects are top notch.Bale and McConaughey are in top physical shape,but look much grungier than their usual ""pretty boy"" images.DVD is fun with cool animated windows, and decent bonus features.over all a great movie to own."
4,I was impressed!,"In reading these other reviews, I'm guessing that these other people are looking for something other than an action film! This grabbed my attention from the beginning. No...they DIDN'T show dragons the whole way through...that's the suspense part, fellows! The special effects were great, the dragons looked awesome, the acting was very believable. In the beginning I was wondering how they were going to ""get us"" to the dragon part...but sure enough, we were jet propelled into dragon land! The ending was the only weak part. That's why I only gave it a four-star rating. It was an emotional thriller that was beautifully made. Great movie."
2,I'm with the previous reviewer,"Okay, it's got great visuals; in fact, they should have had MORE HELICOPTERS and just called this Dragons Versus Helicopters, and done without the plot altogether. Because the plot is...sad to stay...stupid. And when I use that word, I don't mean just a little bit stupid, but way, way stupid. Gosh, it sure was lucky for humanity that there was only the ONE male dragon, and that the females were sort of hive support for it. Just...why did it take through the downfall of the entirely of world civilization to find this out? And why was he so easy to kill once we'd found him? And on and on.So okay, if you're going to spend that much money on the special effects, why not blow a few more bucks on the scriptwriters and not second guess them? This is a movie to watch, for sure, but...with the sound OFF."
1,THIS MOVIE S U C K S!!!!,"With all of our technical advances with regards to CGI and robotics this film COULD have been great. Unfortunately for me and my wallet it was not. The build up was slow and not very explanitory then the last 20 minutes picks up a bit like it's going to start being exciting then it ends!Matthew McConaughey who I usually find to be quite a good actor is nothing but a beefed up termanator in this film, there is absolutely no depth to his character, he's just kind of there! The film is really quite pointless and a very big waste of time and money, and not just your's for watching it, the studio's for making it.Even the dragon's in the film aren't really that good, after all they are the ""big stars"" in this flick, and you barely get to see then except for a few mostly far away shot's and again there's really no explanation as to why they are even there. Please don't waste your money, wait til it comes out on cable."
1,Worthless,"Lets face it, this movie stank!Talk about taking a really excellent idea and just destroying it...The basic plot line is that a dormant dragon has awakened and multiplies to, in effect, create (yet another) post appocalyptic world in which man has to fend for himself in a medieval type setting.When I saw the trailers and clips from this film I thought it was going to be excellent, but what I found was a uninteresting story about a bunch of people arguing about tomatoes and a supposedly highly skilled team of dragon slayers that loose half their crew everytime the kill one dragon..My personal opinion is that this movie has wasted what could have been top notch idea and has prevented any decent dragon movies to be made for a whileStay away"
4,It's Mad Max with dragons,Take a very bleak post apocalyptic world and throw some fire spewing dragons in it and you've got Reign of Fire. A very believeable plot and some fine acting from the lead actors make for a very entertaining movie. Those who hate movies with a dark ugly bleakness about them should pass.
4,Give it a break,"Bah! Dispite it's flaws, it wasn't THAT bad. I have a thing for watching sci-fi/fantasy concept movies no matter how bad they look like they're going to be (and are). So I've seen plenty of absolutely terrible, mediocre, poorly executed, or ludicrous movies (which is the norm sadly) and this one is no-where near that. The creators took a big risk making this movie which is more akin to a graphic novel comic book and did an adequate job setting the mood. True, good special effects alone can't save a movie but in this case I'll say that the fun concept might be broken without what I consider THE best rendered and animated dragon I've seen on film. The Amazon.com editorial was right on."
3,hot and cold,"REIGN OF FIRE started off very promising but then fizzled out.set 20 years into the future,the story is about a group of people who have to survive and work underground.THEREis a new breed of dragons who want to attack the humans by destroying them by blowing fire at them,and living off there burnt ashes.ALAS US SOLDIERS COME TO THE aid of the people and help them to destoy the dragons.BUT THEY are not all destroyed and the ending lets you know that there could be a possible sequel.HOWEVER THE SOUND AND SPECIAL EFFECTS are truly amazing,and this might make you enjoy a so so dvd.ADIOS TILL NEXT TIME."
3,Not a Bad Little Dragon Movie...,"Well, Matthew McConaghey is definitely a bad ... in this one.....I didn't think he could pull it off at first but I think it worked well. Reign of Fire is a solid action-fantasy film. What it lacks in story development and dialogue it makes up for in action and imagery. Similar to the Alien films, it deals with a disgusting monster who ravages humans until their extinction. Think if the 'Aliens' had gotten to earth.....that's kinda the storyline here. Another bright spot is Christian Bale, of course, as the now 'grown up kid' who first discovered the 'main' dragon deep within a mine shaft. Although the story could use a beefed up script (James Cameron could've helped) the film survives as a fun entertaining romp in the not so distant earthly future. ***1/2 stars (out of five). Check it out!"
2,Another missed opportunity!,"Throw this one in the same category as PLANET OF THE APES, THE SCORPION KING, GODZILLA, DUNGEONs & DRAGONS and on and on. What category is this? Why, it's the 'blown opportunity' category! True, Mr. McConaghey and Mr. Bale try hard to overcome the script that they've been given, but in the end they fail. Another one who must ultimately succumb to the dreary material is Rob Bowman, who handled the X-FILES big screen outing to admirable effect. Overall? You can wait for the video."
3,"Strange film, lots of effects but no real soul.",I found it entertaining and could suggest renting it. I could not suggest buying it because for my money I perfer movies that I can better relate to and watch over and over. I have no desire to view this movie again. Once was enough. This is not a bad film however it was not a keeper for the long term.
2,Its really not so hot!,"I must give this movie a bad review because of the deceptive marketing the poster designers used to get me to see this movie. On the posters I saw the dragons flying from military hellicopters ( like the hellicopters in the movie Godzilla ). There is only one single hellicopter in this entire movie and it is a reconasance hellicopter, not a fighting one. Here are my other complaints:1) The ending is very cheesy2) We are never given an explanation on how the dragons were able to stay alive underground.3) There are no landmarks to make it seem that it is really England.4) In order to save mankind they must kill one particullar male dragon out of the many 1,000 female dragons. And it takes them an hour and a half to figure that out. Please, give me a break!"
4,LOOOVE this movie...,"even though all the theories revolving throughout about the dragon infestation aren't well thought out and don't always make sense. HOWEVER. Just love this film, and its ""storybook"" feel...BEST BARE CHESTED MATTHEW MCCONOUGHY EVER!!!! Heads up, Ladies...."
3,Reign of Fire,"I saw this movie once and had to buy it. It is a B movie with big stars made in 2002. Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey and Gerald Butler are the stars. 33 minutes into the movie Matthew said a Dragon claw was found ""in a wheat field South of Coffeyville, KS."" I live here so I had to have this to show friends. It goes on and he tells how the Dalton Boys tried to robe both banks and the townspeople obtained guns and fought the Dalton's. Not a big deal, but catches people off guard when I play it for them. Again, it is a B movie that gets a C+ if you like fire breathing dragon movies I guess it is OK."
4,Soylent Dick Says: Great fantasy and escapism!,"This is a good movie! Granted, the premise is somewhat absurd (the world has been trashed by fire-breathing dragons), but it makes for a good plot with people eking out a miserable existence, hiding from the threat of the dragons (the movie has echoes of some of the Mad Max movies) Eventually, someone discovers a way to destroy them - there is only one male, and kill him, and you kill the species.There is, of course, the priceless line uttered by Quinn: ""Only one thing worse than dragons - Americans!""An above-average movie."
2,"2 stars for life-like special effects. Besides that there's nothing worth watching.,",I give it two stars for life-like special effects. Besides that there's nothing worth watching.
3,The Good and Bad of it.,"I love the way that dragons are more realistically portrayed than in most fantasy films. No cute talking dragons in this. These are creatures simply being what they are. I found the twist on dragons being the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs very original. The dragons themselves were exceptional works of art.On the flip side, there was not enough dialogue. The story is terribly linear so you don't get to know the characters at all. Unless you can remain riveted to explosions and dragons alone, you find your mind wandering. The bad part about that is, even if your mind wanders, you don't miss anything. The whole movie is the same.It's worth watching for the art and refreshing portrayl of dragons, but have a gameboy or something with you when you watch it. LOL"
3,Good dragon special effects!,"I loved the dragon special effects. They were awesomely realistic. The story line wasnt that good. Acting was adequate, but not great. Some times I thought the entire thing cointrived, but if you like dragon ergo dinosaurian effects, this might do for you.I wouldnt buy it again. [ Rental much less disappointing!]"
1,Unhappy,"I never recieved it. Despite multiple attempts to download. Also, the website said I had already downloaded it. I don't have it! No cd, no money. I guess you could say I am a dissatisfied customer."
5,The World's Greatest Buildings Explored and ExplainedThe World's Greatest Buildings Explored and Explained,Great photos as there always is in the DK series. Takes the viewer from ancient Egypt to 1994 completion of the Osaka Airport designed by Piano. Great introduction to architecture.
3,title of review,"it's not there best, but when judged without regard for there later albums, it's quite good... it's alot more violent then later albums like ""A New Kind of Army"", ""Mobilize"" and ""Terror State"", which I don't like, but it's harder too... also, don't listen to that idiot who keeps posting reviews..."
3,its not as bad,anti flag sucks but i grew up with this CD so i still listin to it. anti flag was cool in the 8th grade but not any more still cheack out this CD its not as bad as the rest and you might get into better bands i did
3,something for everyone,"I'm not from So. Cal or anything, but I know what I like. Anti-flag is an intense, free for all of punk energy. They can be as funny as the Vandals at times (with ""Go-Go Dancer"") and as issue oriented as Rancid at others (with the title track, et al.). If you like punk rock at all, there is something on this CD for you. The only reason it doesn't get more stars is because its not my favorite record. Its just really good"
2,"Good music, bad lyrics","Ok, the music is really good... but the lyrics are so lame. I wouldve agreed with these lyrics when I was 12 years old, but grow up. The best song on here is drink drank punk, but most of the other songs I cant stand. Die for your government is the worst song ive ever heard. Id recommend downloading some of their songs instead, dont support them. America is the best, and these guys know it, or else they would leave."
1,"Punk? Nah, a load of bs morelike","This band are a bunch of hypocrites and an embarrassment to the entire punk community. Any band that wants to claim they believe in their material yet that goes round calling ppl 'fags' and 'pussies' for their own believes deserves to rot in hell. They should be labelled as 'poser-punk' that never made it to TRL.Pick up anything from NOFX or Rancid instead, or stick to the early classics."
1,horrible and cliched,"This band is truly terrible. First off, the music is terrible. It's soft and wimpy and lacks any musical credibility. I'm not just saying this because I hate punk. I don't see how anyone can like this. The singer (or singers) have no excuse to BE singing. Don't believe me? Check out ""Daddy Was a Rich Man"". Or pretty much any of their songs. The lyrics are so ridiculous. I appreciate anti-political manifesto very much. The reason they are ridiculous is because they couldn't have made it more obvious that they don't know what they're talking about. All they do is whine. What's the matter, guys? Didn't mommy and daddy give you whatever you wanted? They wouldn't let you take the car out last night? What a joke! As is all punk rock with the exception of a select few who decide to rise above the punk cliche. You want angry music with actual TALENT? Listen to metal."
2,Stupid CD got me thrown in jail!,"Okay, I like Punk rock music. The Government is bad and needs to die, but this cd got me in trouble! I got this off of a rock music store not too far away were I am now. I liked it at first, but bad things started to happen. Yes, in China its illegal to listen to rebellious music. I turned it up and policeman come up to me and says ""What band is this?"" He asked for the lyric book and he took me downtown were I was thrown in jail for 3 days. I now hate anti-flag. I listen to Korn now. Yes!"
1,Are they for real?,"This is pure Green Day sounding garbage that claims to be punk. If you want real punk check out the Clash, Ramones, Social Distortion, .....etc. the list can keep going on. Save your money please."
4,"Clearly, many of you miss the point.",Singing out against injustice will only get old when the injustice is stopped.
3,Early Anti-Flag,"Die For The Government is a good punk album, but it's not a great Anti-Flag album. On this, their first full-length release, the band hadn't quite found their style yet, so the album is mostly old-style hardcore punk that doesn't differentiate in any way from music being released 20 years prior. Of course, that's not a complaint. With classics like ""Drink Drank Punk"" and ""F--- Police Bruality,"" this album is well-worth picking up if you're an A-F fan. But if you're just getting started, pick up Underground Network or The Terror State instead, to discover a more consistent and original Anti-Flag."
4,Anti-Flag: One of the Greatest Punk Bands?,"Despite Anti-Flag's verbal attacks on police by stereotyping them a bullies with badges, Anti-Flag delivers a plethera of issues it there cd, ""Die For The Government"". In it, the talk about government denial of secret tests on our soldiers, the de-unification of punks, the effects of alcohol, and several other subjects. There sound is different in almost each song, and even the vocals seem different, though they're done by the same guy. I didn't give the cd a five, however, because some of the songs seem very mundane, something that i don't associate with Anti-Flag. I still concider this there best cd, though i haven't heard ""They're System Doesn't Work For You"" yet. When and if you do by this cd, listen the the second song, You Gotta Die FOr Your Government, first, not that there's anything wrong with track one, i just think it's the best song up there..."
1,Posers,"Alright, I bought this cd for this one friend(we are enemies now) and I listened to it and it reminds me alot of NOFX. Ive noticed alot of people who sport Anti-Flag also sport bands like AFI and Misfits. This really pisses me off, because: 1 Despite what idiots say AFI isnt and never was ""Punk"". Punk bands dont write about sadness and death nor sing in beautifully clear voices. #2 IMO The Misfits werent punk either. They were raw, but they had a melodic side to them & Glenns Vocals are too professional(This isnt an insult) to be punk(along with the lyrics and music he wrote/made too). The only people I see who like Anti-Flag are little blonde Hottopic Punk posers. If you want TRUE PUNK checkout: Minor Threat(SxE), Old Rancid, The Adicts or The Sex Pistols (whom I dislike)."
1,punks dead,ya know punk was good once now we got dumb bands like anti flag will they please just shut up? this is the worst punk cd ive bought. in fac they dont deserve to be called punk cuz ya know punk was good at one time.
1,terrible quality just after one washing,"I loved the colors and the print of these receiving blankets. However, after the 1st washing (on gentle cycle) all the edges frayed with the whip stiching coming off the blanket on both blankets. Looks like a dish rag now. For quality I'd give it a BIG zero."
1,Not Good after being washed!,"I love the Malawi print and did the baby's room in it. I recieved these blankets as a baby shower gift, and I washed them right away. I haven't even used them and they look terrible. They have little balls on all the edges. I would not recommend this product. I was expecting the quality to be better."
1,A Total Dissapointment,"I normaly love books of this genre, and had heard a good thing about this book from AMAZON.com.BUT, I did not enjoy this read one bit. It was choppy, and the writer seems to lack the poise and style a serious reader needs to have. I was very dissapointed, and would not recomend this book to anyone.I have found this same problem in Mr. Hartov's other novels.If you are looking for good books, consider clicking on one of AMAZON.com's recommended authors for this genre. They are much better!This book was just as bad as Hartov's other poorly written novels!"
3,Emerging Tech,I bought this thing years ago and it was poor audio and grainy pictures but you know what it was pretty good for the time. I used it to convert VHS to CD and pulled off video from camcorders. I got a lot of goody out of it and I am sure if I needed to I would use it in a pinch but so many consumer products have built in ports now to transfer that stuff off that I am sure I will never need it. There is better stuff now but at the time it was really helpful.
1,lol... France.,"I caught this movie on an premium channel (Showtime, HBO, Stars, whatever) and I was confused the entire time. I had the same feeling when I was forced to watch Run Lola Run.If you like obtuse French art-house animation, then I guess you'd like this movie. If you like things that make sense and are slightly less French, then I would not recommend it. It was just too purposely art-sy for my taste. You can achieve the same effect by choosing a random traditional animation off of AtomFilms, adjusting your color settings until your monitor looks like an old sepia-washed post Victorian portrait, with musette/Cajun music in the background while sniffing markers.Though two years of art school helps too."
1,Brilliant Social Criticism,"Triplets contains the most subtle yet daring criticism ever made about greedy, heartless, soulless America: AMERICANS ARE FAT! Triplets is also deceptively dull: Only crude stupid fat Americans would mistake its relentless, unvarying repetition of a few simplistic tropes for something ""grindingly tedious"". These are probably the same people who find the music of Philip Glass ""boring""! It is so obvious to those of us who love this movie that those who don't are just stupid reactionary racist jingoes who marry their cousins and live on potato chips, hot dogs, and jugs of Diet Pepsi. I'm so glad I'm not one of those people."
1,Poseurs Will Love It,"Anyone who doesn't like this movie is a subliterate, nose-pickin' cretin. And I feel sorry for you, I truly do.Anyone who likes this movie is automatically a sensitive, sophisticated, literary, intellectual-type person. Like me.So there."
1,God awful,"I was expecting genius because all the glorious reviews on this website said it was wonderful. Lies! This DVD stole 80 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I've never seen anything more idiotic in my life, with the possible exception of Glitter. I wish I could have given it 0 stars. Thank you."
1,horribly depressing,After the first half hour of this movie I was hoping that it came with razor blade or pills for those who wanted to end it all.
3,Odd,"First of all, the animation is brilliant. If it wasn't for the incredibly unique and beautiful artwork, there would be absolutely NO reason whatsoever to see this movie. The animation is so good, it is capable of carrying virtually no story line or character development. It revolves around this grandmother searching for her kidnapped grandson. She meets the triplets who appear out of nowhere and they risk their lives to help her. Why? Who knows. The chase scene is cleaver but not well thought out. The bad guys are beyond stupid. They couldn't shoot anybody with those gun of theirs if the person was as big as a house. And their cars are only capable of going 3mph. This movie could have been brilliant if it only had a solid story. There was no real thought or emotion put into it. All the concentration is in the animation. This is no where near as good as Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away on any accounts. That's a movie that is perfect in every way possible."
3,weird and odd but still a must see,"The triplets of belleville is no doubt the weirdest movie i have ever seen. the characters look like nothing you have ever seen before. In the begginning of the movie there were a couple of laughs but then it kind of goes slow when she meets the triplets. This movie isn' the best for kids. There are some nudity,lanuguage, and a touch of violence. i dont like how no one says anything, it gets annoying. But all and all it wasn't bad. IT's VERY DIFFRENT. the little boy is very scary looking and found myself fast forwarding it because it was so ugly. The grandmother is awesome in the movie. Go see it, if you dont like it I can see why, and if u do I can see why."
3,"Zany, original, fantastic animation, but lacking in story","Absolutely one of the most most wonderfully drawn animated films with zany characters and truly original ideas in addition to a fantastic musical score, but..and it's a big but, no one goes anywhere in this movie. Every character remains exactly the same. The tough old granny remains a tough old granny (now with 3 eccentric biddies to keep her company), the dog is still fat and faithful, and the nephew or grandson remains a depressed bicycling zombie - you wonder why she went through the trouble to save him."
5,This is a recommendation of the Movie (DVD is out soon),"I saw this movie on the big screen. I cheered for it during the Academy Awards (Nemo won). The animation is very very rich and I'm sure I will see lots more detail upon viewing this 3,4,5,...maybe 6 or more times on DVD. Nothing is lost on the little bits of french in the movie. I hope the DVD is a reasonable presentation of the movie. The music CD is also very good."
3,neat and full of history,"Look if you cant wrap your mind around the past and/or if you haven't taken European History then this movie will most likely not interest you. This movie is marinated with art, music and culture. Unfortunately the plot lacks depth but it is still nevertheless brilliantly displayed."
4,"Clever, if not a little tedious.","The Triplets really made an impression on me when I first viewed it a few years ago. The animation is flawless and colorful, but more it struck me as to what the potential of hand-drawn animation can still do (though major studios feel that it is a dead medium). The caricatures are hilarious and grotesque at times and the humor ranges from the esoteric to the trashy. Which is what makes Triplets such a standout... animation for adults that creates an alternate universe complete with nostalgia for 1930s animation. Belleville itself is a hybrid of New York and Paris with a wine mafia ruling the underworld and overweight masses fumbling through the streets. The plot is a little thin, though the visuals more than make up for its slow parts and (at times) annoying soundtrack. As an animation enthusiast, I loved the film... I'm not sure how the average movie-goer will get it though.It's a great film and is certainly up there among the best animation of the past ten years."
5,Loved it or hated it,"I myself really enjoyed this movie. Was it great? no, but it was different and very entertaining. For those who want meanings in their movies, I suggest you watch other movies that make you feel intellectual. For those of us who watch movies to be entertained, this is a good break from the ordinary, horror/comedy/drama that infiltrates our theaters daily. I would recomend people watch this at least once. I myself am willing to watch it again."
5,It's a rendez-vous you sure can't miss!,"An elder lady by the name of Madame Souza teams up with a trio of Astaire-era lady singers to rescue her cyclist grandson from being kidnapped.That's all there is to the plot here...Otherwise, it's a relaxing break for the grown-ups who have been fed up with what the animation industry's commercial American fare has had to offer in the past few years now. It's produced in Canada, France, Belgium and Britain, so it's automatically better off than anything else hand-drawn, and even up there with Pixar and PDI. The animation, though ugly for some, is of a style not seen since the Disney feature fare of the 60's up till the late 80's. This is the art of the industry at work--courtesy of the film's director, Sylvain Chomet.See it on STARZ! while you can--you, an animation lover, won't get too disappointed. *****/5 stars"
5,Wonderful animation,"Fascinating story, well - illustrated. Can watch it again and again. The animation is as interesting as the plot. Wonderful music as well."
2,"Four stars for visuals, one for story (rounded down)","Not much to add to the below reviews.This is a great looking film, the mix of computer and hand-drawn animation mesh very well. Chomet must of watched a lot of Ralph Bakshi as the inhabitants of Bellville and the cityscapes are very Bakshi-like (tho with less fish-eye lens.)The story...ah...well, I agree with the reviewers who suggest that this would have been better as a short subject, 20-30 min tops.In response to reviewers calling it anti-American, remmeber, the FRENCH Tour de France spectators were as corpulent as the inhabitants of Belleville.In closing, looks great, less filling, not for kids."
2,competent but weird,"I got this one from an interest in The Illusionist, done by he same artist. He is an artist, and his art is competently drawn, but the ""plot"" is weird. It all begins with a very old-fashioned cartoon of a trio of performers on TV before looking at the woman, the bike racer, and the dog who howls at the passing trains. In the end, the aged trio appears, but no point is being made, no true characters are developed. The anatomies are misshapen, the trio's diet is ugly, and there is nothing to bring home and contemplate. It is all an art exercise with a select audience. Not for the public, really. Nothing warming, nothing heartfelt, nothing sad with commiserative appeal. No politics, no heroism, no scenes to recall.I intend to eventually see, maybe buy, The Illusionist, which is reputed to have some of the things missing in this one. This was a disappointment."
4,Wackado Fun and Mysterious Movie,"This came in prefect condition and I love the cover. I have it displayed. I have meant to see this for years and was not disappointed. I couldn't have imagined anything more ""out there"" and genius. The music is terrific and catchy. I loved the ""Triplets"" and was more engaged when they were in the plot. I was forwarned about its being uncouth, so I was prepared. It's a brilliant hoot."
3,Les Triplets de Belleville,"Warning on subtitles: The English subtitles only are in English for sounds effects, which aren't needed. When translation from French to English is needed with English subtitles on, the subtitles are in French. Kind of defeats the purpose."
4,Great cult cartoon for adults,"This is a great campy cartoon-style movie for adults. It is particularly good if you have poor hearing, as the music is good and there is basically no dialogue. The incredible expressions on the caricatures speak volumes. You don't have to hear to know what they would be saying if they were speaking, but the beat of the music is worth hearing!"
1,Pure Crap-ola!,"This is one of the very WORST films I have seen in my entire lifetime!!! None of the characters talk, the animation is a ripoff of Ralph Bakshi's work, and it was very SLOW-MOVING!!!! Don't bother wasting your time and your money renting or buying this God-awful waste-of-film movie! You'll thank me later."
5,the greatest movie,"After watching this movie with my little brother, big sister, and Dad, I knew that this was my new favorite movie. It included sizzling songs, and although a little nudity was in it,(even in cartoons), my little brother, who's 10, enjoyed it equally as I did. without words, some of the parts were a bit confusing, especially with the french, but in the end it was all worth it. I highly suggest that, no matter what type of movies you like, you go check this one out."
4,Triple fun,"This animated French film contains a tip o' the chapeau in an early scene: It's a glimpse of a poster of ""Monsieur Hulot's Holiday."" ""Belleville"" owes much to Jacques Tati's classic 1953 comedy. Both movies find humor in the daily details of life, rely on little dialogue and are artfully constructed. Hulot is Tati's signature character, a well-meaning, pipe-smoking boob in flood pants who sets off little fires everywhere his springy feet take him. In Holiday, they take him to a beach town, an ideal spot for sweet-natured sight gags that celebrate youthful mischievousness and gently poke fun at polite society. Hulot returns in Mon Oncle, a delicious satire of antiseptic modernity and a bourgeoisie eager to climb the social ladder in a new postwar world. Tati opts for the old world; Hulot's neighborhood may be crumbling, but it's full of life and soul."
2,"Boring, boring, boring!","So boring I couldn't finish it! How could a cartoon be so slow...?! One good point - the cartoon has some nice moments like seeing the dog bark in slow motion at the train & passengers going by. But really, I rented it and couldn't bring myself to watch the rest of it. I finally returned it."
2,Why no French audio?,"Disappointed here. Thought I was buying an English-subtitled, French-audio disc, but the audio is mostly in English. Probably safer to buy a disc entitled ""Les Triplettes de Belleville."""
5,Bizarre and fantastic,"I love these kind of movies, so I am definitely a biased reviewer. But this film is eclectic and weird in all the best possible ways. It makes you pay attention to the little details of film, in a way a lot of films ignore. And it's beautiful."
5,BEST ANNIMATED MOVIE IN YEARS,I absolutly love this movie.I origionaly thought it would be stupid I hadn't herd of it before but was forced into going to the theater to see it I was amazed the annimation is incredile the story is clever and funny as hell and I bairly noticed through the whole movie that there was no talking its just incredible it sould have won more accadamy awards I belive it won 1 for best song but Finding Nemo was funny but this was outragiouse get ASAP you won't be sorryAnd one more thing that whole thing with the annaimators just trying to make fun of Americans come on that (...) its not ever funny what they did was clever and funny and anybody who can't see it as just ignorant and close minded
2,Minimalist Plot and Characters,"Mr. Bernabo's spotlighted review does an excellent job of describing what the film is about and what it looks like. So if you are interested primarily in eclectic, hand-drawn animation that references old movies and cartoons and French pop culture from two generations ago, you'll really dig this one. Unfortunately, for those of us who also want a compelling story, interesting characters, and some kind of point to it all, we are sh*t out of luck on this one. Ultimately I must agree with the one- and two-star reviews here: The cumulative effect of watching Triplets is one of excruciating tedium. And grotesque, offensive stereotypes don't become charming simply because they happen to be showcased in a ""hip"" format. In this instance, at least, context doesn't subvert them, or even sanitize them. I'm afraid we will have to keep waiting for a decent alternative to the pervasive Disney-style cartoon."
3,Reverse character development,"This movie starts off very well. Unfortunately, the boy's character, who is initially quite charming, becomes zombie like. Sadly, I'm not exagerating. I find that one element ruins the movie, despite the rest of it being otherwise well done."
3,"Good movie, but...","The film is a visual success. It does however have a significantly prejudicial depiction of Americans. There is no doubt Belleville is based on New York City, as you clearly see the Statue of Liberty when the protagonist enters the bay. What you then see is a population made up entirely of immensely fat citizens. Yes, it's the big fat Americans, and we're talking Shamu fat here. The French characters, even the Mafiosos, are of course all thin and healthy. It's a minor detail to the story as a whole but prejudice is prejudice no matter what the current popular opinion may be. This particular depiction left an otherwise brilliant movie tainted with the director's bias."
2,"When it sucks, it blows.","No plot, gawdawful ugly traumitizing character designs, the sound needs work (the crashing cars sound like tinfoil) & it's rather irritating. Sadly, the 1st 5 minutes were the best part."
1,Boring,I could not finish this film. The pacing is tediously slow. The best character is the dog and they treat him poorly. The art style is neither visually appealing nor unique enough to be intriguing despite its ugliness. Having a weak plot to tie together vignettes is not original. A few grotesquely stylized characters is not that original either. Watching this was a total waste of time.
1,Torturous!,"My God! This movie hurts so bad! While the movie is gorgeous visually, it tries too hard to be different. I do love art movies. It almost had an Eraserhead feel to it, but believe me, if you liked Eraserhead, you might as well watch that for the hundreth time. It's funny when five people say it's the best movie they've seen, then everyone thinks it great. Thank heavens I'm smart enough not to sit through this disaster again!"
5,Word of the Day: Grotesque,"I usually think it is a cop-out when folks begin an essay with, ""according to Webster..."" but in this case I think Webster could say, ""as seen in The Triplets of Belleville"" so, here goes.Definition of GROTESQUEa : a style of decorative art characterized by fanciful or fantastic human and animal forms often interwoven with foliage or similar figures that may distort the natural into absurdity, ugliness, or caricatureb : a piece of work in this styleSo, that's what you need to know. Enjoy this brilliant animated film. No, it is NOT for children. Really, it's not."
5,Best animated movie?,That's my opinion. The animation is glorious and unique. I can't wait for Sylvain's next movie.
1,A Bomb!,"This is the worst movie I have seen since ""The Black Pirates."" That goers back 60 years. It was dull, badly put together and pretentious in the extreme. I should have known the French never produce anything worthwhile. Any people who had a 75 year old love affair with Edith Piaf, ""The Singing Waif,"" (lousy voice, stupid songs), could only produce something like this; that makes an ""in thing"" out of ugly pictures, disgusting scenes and lousy music. What a bomb!"
1,Too weird to enjoy,"Ok, maybe I'm not the most sophisticated movie-goer, but I did not enjoy this movie. I had heard that it was fantastic, and I had high expectations, but I was very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend unless they were the type who say they like strange things just to prove how unique they are.The grandmother and the dog were appealing and interesting characters, but the rest of them were incomprehensible. The music was annoying, as were the garbly French voices. The plot was simple, yet it didn't make any sense - even in a cartoon land - especially the chase scene at the end.If you go to see it, just be prepared for an odd, unusual movie - in all respects. If that's your bag, you just might like it."
2,"overrated, & that purportedly brilliant musical score is just plain annoying","a big disappointment. perhaps i just wasnt in the mood for as highly stylized a piece of animation that night, but i just couldnt bring myself to give a hoot about the characters or the art work. and i found that highly vaunted musical score to be nothing less than annoying."
2,maybe I just don't get French humor,"OK, the first ten minutes is some of the finest you'll ever see in animation. Great music, characters, atmosphere...but then something odd happens. The director runs out of things to do. I realize the director cut his teeth on animated ""shorts"" and I believe this is his first full length feature. I think he should have stayed with the shorts. The lack of dialogue was intreging and the animation was fine but the lack of story really hurt. It was slow in too many places and I had absolutely no feeling toward the grandson, turned bicyclist. Fat dog barking at trains; who cares?"
5,Sorry about the confusion,"you know what, i am cooler than avril fan #1this movie rocks my socks. have an open mind and be willing to laugh at the much overblown and scobberlotcher americans"
3,movie,"The art is ok, its just nothing like I envisioned it. There is practically no talking anywhere in the movie, so my attention span struggled, and I never made it to the end. If I hadn't read the little paragraph that described the plot I wouldn't have had a clue what the plot even was. But someone with better focus and a low tolerancefor noise may enjoy it."
5,Just see it!,"Wow! There aren't words. Who would've thought a silent, animated film from France would leave one so speechless? This movie is currently being passed from hand to hand to everyone in town."
2,"Excellent Movie, Bad DVD","I got this item from Amazon, their info says the aspect ratio is 1.78:1 (widescreen) and the DVD case says so as well but when I pop in the DVD it informs me that the film has been formatted to fit my (a 4:3) screen. Which means the sides are cut off, you're missing part of the film. I don't know if this was a fluke or if they packaged it that way (DVD companies have done stupid things in the past) but I passed the refund date on my purchase before I watched so make sure to put in the disk and check the aspect ratio if that matters to you before watching it. That said, it's a fantastic film, gets a lot of story across with only 2 lines of dialogue, and just amazing visuals and sound design. Again, wonderful film, bad DVD."
5,The Triplets of Belleville,"It is now one of my favorite films. The story line is easy to follow. I can't remember where I saw a preview of the movie, but was determined to find a copy. Went to Amazon, and there it was."
5,"Great film, an instantaneous animated classic.","This was a subperb animated film, especially while in the midst of otherwise superior CGI features. Definetly a throw-back to the hand-drawn animation of the 1930's, but still something to marvel at. I also found that, though nearly absent of spoken conversation, it was even more enveloping than ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Shrek"" combined, proving that intelligent dialogue doesn't have to be spoken. At last, we have an animated movie for adults that children can appreciate, not the other way around."
5,I AM THE MOVIE: BEST ALBUM OF 03,"Ever since the new Weezer album never appeared in the winter of 03 I was pretty bummed out on the years new releases, but the new Motion City Soundtrack album I AM THE MOVIE turned this all around. the album is incredible. This is an amazing album if you dont already have it pick it up."
2,did not like this music much,was recommended to me by roommate but i did not enjoy this. sounds too emo i think.
3,I wish I could rate it better.,"I wish I could say this album is the greatest thing to ever hit the electronic/punk rock world, but it's really not. The final track ""AOK"", however, is without a doubt one of the greatest songs I have ever heard. Although it's a very stretchy comparison, I'd say that ""AOK"" is alot like ""Until the day I Die"" by Story of the Year, which is also just a simply amazing song wrapped within a mediocre album.I would personally suggest going to itunes.com or something and just downloading ""AOK"" and maybe ""The Future Freaks me Out"" if you want a laugh (this song is incredibly catchy)."
5,...and then there's Motion City Soundtrack,"ahhhhhh. what a lovely cd. either they planted messages behind the music to make everyone who listens love them or it's a AMAZING WONDERFUL SPLENDIFEREOUS (if thats evena word) cd. i think it's choice two. but eh, to each their own. this cd is the bestest. support mcs...i know i do. i'll be bacck with a capital H that says hero and the hero is me! what else can i say? it's great anyone considering buying this...should... be spontaneous! don't think about it! just buy it! believe me you won't be even slightly disappointed. motion city soundtrack makes me smile big, the ones that show all your teeth...ps>the best songs are ""capital h"",""a-ok"", and ""perfect teeth"" and everything else is super de duper as well."
4,Awesome Live,"I never had Motion City Soundtrack's Album, but I just saw them live with Story of The Year, Adair, and Letterkills, and there were amazing. They're an awesome live band, and if they sound as good live as they do on CD, then I would defintley get this."
2,Schrader Lite,The first and only time I saw this is when it was first released. I was expecting something more. Maybe a lot more. Fox has always been waaaay too milktoast (and Joan Jett just plain milk) for most of us cinephiles. Maybe only in 1989's CASUALTIES OF WAR was Fox's milktoastiness used to good advantage in contrast with the Penn character. Schrader has said in interviews that this is semi-autobiographical. Jason Miller and Gena Rowlands do provide good supporting performances.Next!
1,not pleased,"This item was advertised at very good which is the reason I ordered this particular one. However, the quality was poor to fait at best. It was disappointing as this was a gift."
2,trent reznor as a blonde. how to die for.,"the movie - typical michael j. fox heartwarmer about a angsty brother-sister rock star duo. the rest pales in comparison to the mini-role by trent as a blonde. (how cute!) joan is adequate, laughable as the rebelious rocker. cute of course, as always. michael's performance is painful - he's the typical pseuo-rocker-boy, all style (or what he and the suits believe is style) and absolutely zero substance."
3,Light of Day,A Large portion of the movie could not be viewed even though reported to be in good condition with just the box dented
5,"Almost as good as ""Teen Wolf Too""","Is there a more perfect mom and dad in the world than Alex P. Keaton and Joanna ""Jo"" Marie Polniaczek from ""The Facts of Life""? Or were they supposed to be brother and sister? In any case, they really know how to cook up a tearjerker and they can definitely take care of a nauseatingly cute tyke monster. I personally think it was a mistake for Jo to switch from militant lesbian biker babe to white trash heterosexual. However, anything to improve on Alex as GOP spokesmodel I would have to say is a turn for the better."
1,One of the most terrible movies I've ever seen,"I originally saw this in a double-feature with ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and would have left the theatre had I not wanted to see the other film. This is a terrible movie. The wonderful and lovable Michael J. Fox is miscast here as a troubled youth and Joan Jett is painful. Save yourself the time. Get something else."
1,Light of Day [VHS],It was an ok buy. I could not watch it on one of my vcr's. It was a very poor picture. There were lines through the whole thing.
5,VHS IS FAR TOO SUBSTANDARD TO VIEW ANYMORE.,"I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. i LOVE FOX'S MOVIES AND THIS IS ONE OF HIS BEST. i AM CONFUSED BY THE MAKERS OF THIS MOVIE AND THE PROBLEM THEY HAVE WITH MAKING IT AVAILABLE IN THE U.S.A IN THE HIGH QUALITY DVD FORMAT. ARE THEY IN BUSINESS TO PLEASE THEIR CUSTOMERS AND TURN A PROFIT? WILL SOMEBODY WITH THOSE WHO PROVIDE THIS MOVIE PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TOTAL NON-SENSE?HOPEFULLY,RON"
1,No English track!,"I too just bought it because the editorial review said it has the English track, but it does not. It only has the Italian track."
1,Not in English,It was advertised on Amazon as being in 2 languages.... Italian AND in English so I bought it! It's ONLY in English so I can't watch it!
2,Book Opinion,Good book but I don't recommended it for no one who's planning on taking a law enforcement test. There aren't enough reading comprehension exercises to choose from and the ones that are don't equate to the material that will be administered in the actual police examination.
1,worst of Asimov,"Yes, I do like Asimov a lot. Yes, he is one of my favorite authors. But this does not change the fact that this is a slow-moving book with all characters having exactly the same character - that of Asimov himself. Very weak indeed."
2,Very odd.,"This complex novel is definetly odd for Asimov.I have read many of his books, and enjoyed all of them... except this one. I have tried to read it 2 or 3 times, and I can never follow the plot close enough to understand what's going on. The beginning sections show great promise (as story line goes), but as I read on, it became less and less interesting. Asimov himself tells his readers in the preface that this book is an oddity for him, in terms of style.If you've read Asimov before and really enjoy his writing technique, I would caution you about this book. Some may be able to enjoy it. However, I doubt anyone who has a taste for his other books could really enjoy reading it."
3,"New plotline, new characters",Isaac has created a new plot line which is separate from his other series. This novel is written for a late teen audience. No violence or adult situations. Just a simple step by step adventure.
3,"Good Story, Poor Ending","Having Read much of the Foundation Series as well as what I feel is Asimov's most inspired work ""I, Robot"", I recently picked up a copy of Nemesis. At once, I found Nemesis to be very suspenseful, and I found the character development to be quite creative, though a little predictable at times. The book built more and more intensely towards a climax which sadly never came. It seemed to me that the Asimov must have been under a very tight deadline to finish this book because at the most interesting point, the entire story line simply dissolved in a matter of 4 or 5 pages with nearly nothing resolved. Needless to say, I found this work to be a little disappointing"
2,"Unfortunately, the worst Asimov","FWIW, I love Asimov particularly the Foundation and Robot series, but really anything I've read of his including non-fiction--until now. This is a particularly plodding tale with wooden characters, little action, and repetitive exposition.I finished it just for closure and the ending was particularly disappointing.If you want to read good Asimov, start with the Foundation series and you'll be hooked, but for goodness sake do not judge his work by this mess. I fully understand that tastes differ, but I have to really wonder about those reviewers who have given this a 5 star rating. That is just wrong."
4,Pretty Good.,"This is a great science fiction novel. I think it's one of Asimov's best. However, there are parts that will make you want to scream, ""Get on with it!"""
2,Surprisingly boring...,"I was quite excited to dig into this novel, as it was my first experience with Asimov's work. And it will most likely be my last.The overall plot and storyline is actually decent, but the extremely slow progression of events and sheer amount of dialog makes for a very dull read. I agree very much with some of the previous reviews in that Asimov seems to beat several dead horses over and over again: yes, Marlene is not pretty. Yes, we know she knows Erythro won't hurt her. yes, we know Siever doesn't hide anything from her. Yadda yadda yadda. Get on with it."
4,Great book,"This is a great book, generally speaking. The main character is a bit unusual, and so are her relationships with various other characters. The action is good, suspence is well done, and the side plots, though small, have some interest.It's not a earth-shattering book, though, but, then, few books truly are. And I have to agree with another reviewer, who said the plot unraveled too fast at the end, but I think it detracts little from the book."
3,"If it's called Nemesis, it better well be that!","This is the very first Asimov book I have ever read and perhaps it was not the greatest choice out of the hundreds he has written in his lifetime. Although it was a fairly decent story the ending was a bit too neat and tidy to live up to its name. With a title like 'Nemesis' it better be that. Unfortunately for me, I felt like the entire book was a build-up of nothing and quite a slow progression of effects. Although it was written well I found myself thinking if 'he did this...' or if 'he did that...' it would be a better tale. Also, I was strikingly surprised by the amount of detail left out with...well...everything. It was like reading a script for a film where all you need to pay attention to is the dialogue. Regardless, I liked the writing and the concept even if the ending fell back into a neat little description of just who and what is a Nemesis. I'm sure I will pick up another Asimov book eventually, just not anytime soon."
2,Asimov Has Done Better,"Nemesis is far from Aismov's best work. In fact, it is one of the weakest, which is surprising since it was written late in his career when he was well-established as a mature, accomplished author. The ""secret"" of the key plot element--the strange bond between the planet Erythro and a 15-year-old character--is so obvious every reader will certainly have figured it out almost as soon as it is introduced. Perhaps the weakest element of the book is the characters. Not one is truly likable. In fact, it's hard to care what happens to any of them, except, possibly, for the arrogant, manipulative chairman of the runaway Rotor colony. For him we hope for a slow, painful death, or at least that one of the other characters will deliver a much-deserved punch in the nose by the end of the book."
5,Nemesis,"Isaac Asimov was one the best science fiction writers I've ever read. He sends us a message to the future, maybe a possible future. Ana Maria Charlier Madeira"
3,Well...,"If you are a true punk funker and fan of Rick James/Friends like me, this is a waste if you have the albums. But for those entering into the world of Punk Funk, this is a must have. I was wishing for Val Young's and Stone City Bands's album(s) to be re-issued, but I guess I will settle for this CD because it includes their most popular and requested tracks. RIP Rick...Punk Funk 4Ever and 4Ever missed."
3,Pretty Good But Where Is the Rest Of Some Of The Songs,"This album has some very interesting and enjoyable songs in their full length versions but what about ""If You Should Ever Be Lonely,"" by Val Young? I consider this to be the coolest song on the album but it only provides the radio edited version. When will record companies learn to stop fooling with their customers and provide only full length songs. It's a total turnoff to music fans like myself and no wonder why the music industry is suffering financially when they pull this crap all the time. Here is the list of songs and times this CD has to offer.1. Standing On the Top (9:55)2. All Night Long (5:45)3. I'm a Sucker For Your Love (5:55)4. Ebony Eyes (5:02)5. Little Runaway (9:32)6. Strut Your Stuff (4:00)7. In My House (5:05)8. Seduction (8:10)9. If You Should Ever Be Lonely (3:52)10. The Bells (4:20)11. Fire and Desire (7:16)"
4,this is a Good collection,"glad to see Rick as a Artist,writer,Producer,&the Other Proteges he had brought to the Forefront here. the stone City Band had some cool jams.""little Runaway"" is cool.Val Young ""seduction(Make note of where Mary J.Bliege got her whole Game from) is still banging.Process&the doo Rags whose Debut Album came out on Sony Music because Motown didn't Green Light Rick's ""Mary Jane Records"" label back in 85 when it was due.Teena Marie&the Mary Jane Girls are Represented here as well.this is a Cool Tribute to the Musical Genius of Rick James.a Very Versatile Soul Brother RIP."
5,KAWAIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!,AWWWWW!!! I WAN'T IT!! it's SOOO cute. mwahaha my plushie army is growing!! it'd be intresting to see a kakashi plushie.KAWAIIII!!
3,"Love Prine, but this one isn't his best.","A little too amped up for my liking. Prine definitely had adequate 'energy' when he made this record. A good record, especially if you like Prine. Bruised Orange, among others, are much better."
3,For the Old Time Stonehill Fan only,"If you like Randy, you'll love this. If you just like Randy's music, you may not care for it. It is fun for someone who remembers the Norman-Stonehill time before the sad implosions. The innocent old days. In short, it's an historical document more than a musical one. Myself, I waited 35 years to finally hear ""In Norman's Kitchen."" And I'm glad I finally got to hear what everyone used to talk about but no one could get their hands on. If you are curious, you can stil by the CD new at the still-up-and-running Larry Norman website--which makes way more sense than throwing away the huge money a couple sharks are asking you to pay here for used CDs."
4,tito puente fue muy chevre!!,este disco se amo!! i love tito puente and his son and i think it is a great cd. i only gave it 4 stars cuz i haven't finished listening to it yet so i don't know how it all sounds but so far tito puente sounds really good.
2,Misleading Title,"This little volume would make a handy travel dictionary, but only if you want to read the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in the original. The title is misleading since this is not a dictionary of modern Hebrew, but of classical, biblical Hebrew. There is a world of difference between the two. The listing on-line is quite misleading. The actual volume on the other hand is clearly labeled as biblical Hebrew."
3,Worth about five dollars,"This is an excellent basic biblical Hebrew dictionary. It falls apart with a certain amount of use, so I wouldn't buy a used one. It's not worth the amount asked for here; you can get them for about 5 dollars at the Strand in NYC."
2,Very Dissapointed,"The title of this item is: ""Langenscheidt Pocket Hebrew Dictionary: Modern Hebrew-English (Langenscheidt Pocket Dictionary)""It is not at all modern. In fact, it appears to be based on Masoretic/ancient/biblical Hebrew. It does state on the back of the cover that is is for biblical studies, but as a student of modern Hebrew it is almost useless.It may of course be a great dictionary for Biblical studies, but I wouldn't know."
4,A solid farewell....,"Perhaps caving in 2 commercial pressure (adding lots of rather nice vocals) & bad timing (1977 -- punk rock was becoming the big thing in Britain), on their final album Gryphon moves away from their more adventurous instrumentals & perhaps sounds like a gentler Jethro Tull. & it works! ""Spring Song"" should've been a progressive-rock landmark. ""Fall of the Leaf"" & ""Major Disaster"" R nearly as good. The only wasted track is the 1 instrumental. Just goes 2 show that being brilliant & talented won't get U everything -- but these guys put out 5 really enjoyable, at times brilliant, albums. But them!"
3,A pleasant but non-essential prog-rock album,"This album has some fine moments, but overall is a letdown after the instrumental bliss of ""Red Queen to Gryphon Three"". Brian Gulland's bassoon still set Gryphon's sound apart from every other rock band. But the band was blindly searching for a sound that would sell some records, adding vocals, venturing into more standard territory (""Flash in the Pantry"" is the epitome of generic prog-rock), and even experimenting with jazz fusion (""Snakes and Ladders""). ""Spring Song"" is a beautiful song, marred only slightly by a cliched snare-drum intro and close, and ""Round & Round"" is pleasant. ""Major Disaster"" is rescued by a memorable chorus."
1,doesn't do anything,"Sadly this didn't do anything to help my scar, even though I used it very soon after the surgery, and used it as directed. Also it got kind of gross and gummy."
3,"Good quality, but little results","This fits tummy tuck scars well, but it loses its stickiness rather quickly. Be prepared to clean it daily if you're a man. Also, I'm not convinced the scar has healed any more quickly using this than it would have under normal circumstances."
1,Terrible software - terrible support!,"I tried the online demo version of the software and it worked fine. I ordered the software and guess what - it doesn't work. Tech support is a joke. Don't buy this software - it doesn't work, and tech support doesn't care."
2,A Distant Third...,"If textbooks were judged by their weight, this one would be worth every penny of its purchase price. For better or worse, textbooks are judged by content and this one is lacking. The book itself is really a collection of articles on ER related topics from a variety of authors. The articles are repetitious, contain a lot of extraneous irrelevant information, and often conflict with one another. The antibiotic recommendations are hopelessly out of date. In general, a poorly written, poorly edited work which is a distant in the world of EM texts. Save your money."
5,Gold standard,As an ER PA this is the gold standard to start with. Rosens is much more detailed but is too much to start with. I've found most everything I need is in this text.
1,Past date,The book is too old for modern em management in terms of ACLS/PALS protocols. This edition should not be sold.
5,More than I expected,"For the sum total of 25.00 including shipping. This book was basically brand new and had no crumpled pages, writing, nor any deformities on the cover. Seller was quick to answer me emails and delivered ahead of time. Book came from south dacoda to san Diego with the quickness. About 4 days."
4,As promised,"It was delivered on time, as promised, and was a great new copy with fantastic packing materials and was brand new. The book is what it is, a freaking huge reference ER book. All in all a good buy. Thanks!"
4,Surprised,"I have anxiety issues and it gets much worse when I'm stressed. I manage the symptoms by eating healthy, exercising and living a healthy lifestyle. Sometimes that's not always enough to help. I'm not a big fan of medication either. I was watching Dr. Oz and saw this as an idea for stress releif. Honestly I didn't have any expectations because I'm a skeptic. The first few times I took one of the capsules I had forgot i had taken them but felt noticeably more relaxed. It was a major shift but noteworthy. I view herbal options as one of many solutions to a comprehensive solution for stress and anxiety. I would say give it a try and check with a Dr. Before use if you are taking any meds and remember herbal remedies aren't regulated by the FDA."
3,Results were not evident...,"I took this stuff for awhile. Supposedly it is an adaptogen and its particular benefit is to help regulate sugar levels. While I did note my glucose levels were occasionally lower than expected...at times they were higher and in total they seemed more random. I do order other stuff from NOW foods and am generally pleased with their product, but I tossed the last of the second bottle of this stuff in the trash when I was filling my pill minder the other day. No noticeable side effects that I could tell."

1,Won't play on computer,"I got this DVD and it won't play on my computer's DVD player. That's were I play all my DVDs, so I have to say don't buy. If you want to watch, wait for TV."
2,There IS a need to fear,"Almost everything you fear this is going to be, it is -- cheesy, dull, loud, overproduced, under-inspired and a waste of talent. The film's only saving grace is it isn't offensive. You can let your kids watch it without worry.Stay away from it, though, if you're a fan of the beloved original series. After the title sequence, this movie has no respect for the old television show and never approaches its waggish sense of humor. You'll be better served by the new DVD collections of the TV series --The Ultimate Underdog Collection Volume 1,The Ultimate Underdog Collection Volume 2andThe Ultimate Underdog Collection Volume 3. They're badly edited, but they're better than this."
1,a scratch in CD,"Unfortunately the CD was defective, something the seller had not noticed. When told about the problem, seller immediately responded, saying money would be refunded when the item was returned. A responsible seller even if the item was a disappointment."
2,underdog,A lab accident gives a hound named Shoeshine some serious superpowers -- a secret that the dog eventually shares with the young boy who becomes his owner and friend.
3,Underdog the movie,Not the best but nice light entertainment. It was enjoyable. It was well paced but slowed a little towards the end but overall was a good movie that kept my interest or at least the kid in me interest.
2,Just Stick With The Cartoon.,"I love Underdog the cartoon show. I enjoyed watching it ever since I was 17 years old. Why couldn't they just animate the movie instead of releasing it in a live action form? Reallity trashes Underdog. The girl dog was cute, but still, I like the characters animated. I've heard they're going to release a Tom and Jerry movie in live action. Why won't reallity leave animation alone?"
2,"MAY DISAPPOINT FANS OF THE CLASSIC CARTOON, BUT OK FOR THE KIDDIES!","I don't want to be too harsh on this little 'kiddies' movie, but lets be honest, 'Under Dog' is a 40 year old cartoon and this movie should have been geared towards adult fans. It would be OK to make it tame enough for kids to enjoy too. Instead, we get a weird reinvention of the old classic cartoon. First off having Jason Lee voice Under Dog was not the best decision as he is so well know from his ' My Name Is Earl' series that I couldn't get the show out of my mind and I expected Crab-Man to pop in at any minute and say ""Hey Earl""!.The FX are done well, but it's a pretty bland movie. It's also a very short film well under an hour an a half.....this is probably a good thing, but I would have felt cheated if I paid $10.00 to see an hour an 10 minute movie(if you don't count the credits)! If you have kids I'm sure they will like it, but if you're an adult looking for some sort of nostalgia....forget it. ;-b"
3,"Not overly creative, but mildly fun","The movie tried to do its best with the original material. They kept Underdog a dog, Polly a dog, and Simon a human. However, Shoeshine was a wise-cracking dog and not a humble shoeshine dog/boy? The movie had some mild chuckles. The movie played up looking at the world from a canine point of view pretty well. I was disappointed they made the Underdog theme song a rap. There is a ""Scrubs"" episode where the song was sung acapella by a barbershop type group. It worked very well. In my opinion, they should had followed that lead or mixed it up some. The movie didn't do anything really creative. The actors were ok. The plot was predictable.In summary, the movie was ok. The humor was the strongest part of the movie and the canine/human relationship works somewhat. Don't expect too much and definitely rent don't buy."
4,Hilarious + Good special effect = The funniest family movie of 2007.,We watched this DVD during Christmas eve. We like movies with real animal actors. This move is hilarious. It also has good special effect. Don't expect much from the plot because it's a film for kids. It brought great fun to our whole family. It's the funniest family movie of 2007.
4,Underdog,"my grandson loves this movie, we had to purchase it for that reason. It is an entertaining movie. I would recomend it to parents with small children."
1,Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?,"This is nothing like the cartoon in the 1960's. Flaw number 1: He and the dogs are treated like pets by the humans instead of equals in the toon. Flaw number 2: The dogs in the film look NOTHING like the dogs in 60's series. Flaw number 3: CGI is gargabe almost as bad as the one from Howard The Duck. Flaw number 4: The Villain and his sidekick in the film looks nothing like the ones in the cartoon. Flaw number 5: The movie focus too much on the human owners then we do on Underdog. Flaw number 6: The film saids he got his powers when he accidentally got shot by a laser beam and keeps the powers by the end of the film while in the cartoon, he gets his powers from blue pills. Flaw number 7: Recycled material from other films. Flaw number 8: Sloppy production. I give this [bleep] a 0 out of 10."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Defiantly, not the same Underdog that I grew up watching!!! My kids loved it, and I will have to admit, it was better than I expected!"
3,Needlessly embellishes Scripture,"Yes, this book is cute and attention-grabbing - but at the expense of the accuracy of the Holy Scriptures. The stories are embellished to make the content more gripping to a young boy (e.g., David is urged to wear armor to fight Goliath, but tells Saul, ""Get me outta this tin can! I gotta do this my way!""). We should neither add nor subtract from the Bible; an appropriate treatment for a young child might be to simplify the content. My fear was that my son might start recalling the Bible stories as they appear in the book rather than how they appear in the Bible, so I returned the book. I've given 3 stars because of the adorable drawings and well thought through exercises following each story. These could be used independently after reading the same story in a children's Bible."
5,Great intro to Bible Stories,"This book is wonderful! My 3 1/2 year-old son was so enthralled with the vibrant stories and fascinating pictures that he actually cried when I told him that we had read the last story! He asked to sleep with his special Bible.No, the stories are not verbatim scripture, but it is a Bible STORY book -- not a Bible. The stories are told in such a way as to interest young boys and give them a general understanding of what the Bible tells us. I believe that making that connection at a young age will lead to a strong foundation and an interest in reading the Bible as he grows older. As for now we both cherish our special time reading alone together. I just bought the girls' verson for my daughter and can't wait to give her the same wonderful gift."
2,Does God like girls?,"Though the book is interesting because of its colorful pictures and descriptive text, take a look at what it teaches little boys about women. In the Adam and Eve story, Eve whines in order to get Adam to eat the fruit. Also, when Eve tries to defend herself after Adam has blamed everything on her, Adam won't let her speak, and she obeys. In the Genesis account, God encouraged Eve to tell her story. Though I have no sons (I came across this book as a topic for a children's literature paper.), I would not read this ""Bible"" to a little boy. There are so many other children's Bibles out there that stick closer to the biblical text and don't demean women."
2,"It's fun to see it work, but consider it just a toy.","Well, it's fun to see it work, but I consider it almost a toy and not much more. It takes too long to clean even a small area. It bumps and keeps going to the same spot again. On wood floors dirt would be blown out of the path of the Roomba so most of it would not get picked up. Battery life is a big problem as well. I returned my Roomba and stick with my Vacuum from now on."
3,Great little machine,"I bought the Roomba, but did not really think it would work all that well. I was surprised. The Roomba is easy to use and it really does pick up dirt from the floor. I believe I made a very good investment."
1,bad roomba,This product was returned because it did not work. Amazon could not replace it & therefore it was returned for a refund.
3,Roomba Discovery Review,"I like the idea of the Roomba more than I actually liked my Roomba. The battery life was not long enough to finish cleaning a room, and it did not do a good job cleaning corners. The Roomba kept cleaning the same spots over, and over again...rather than moving onto the uncleaned parts of the floor. The self docking charge station again sounds better than it actually works. Out of the ten times that my Roomba's battery died, I think it may have made it to the docking station on it's own once - because it has to ""see"" the docking station to head towards it. I returned my Roomba Discovery...but as they keep making improvements on the Roomba, I may become interested again."
5,good staff,"I love it! It is very convience, only needed is to touch a button,it cleans your whole house. The item is new, and working properly. It actually goes back to the base when it finishes its job."
3,Roomba Discovery,The concept is great here but whether it is because of the remanufacturing or a defect the battery time is only about 30 minutes rather than the 120 minutes claimed in the blurb
3,It's OK ...I guess,"Gets stuck too much on the frings of throw carpets and draps. We have a lot of oriental silks and this happens often. Otherwise its fun, almost a toy."
2,it may be a good product if it wasn't DOA,Purchased roomba discovery and got it DOA. Never had such problem with amazon.com before this time. Called i-robot several times. After walking through all the instructions (which include the need of purchasing a dust cleaner at my cost) i-robot finally agreed to let me get an exchange unit as long as I pay for the shipping. How nice!
1,Better hope your unit works.,"Unit apparently has a faulty battery. I've been dealing with the iRobot service department for almost two months.One service rep was convinced that the battery was in a state of ""deep discharge"". So, after going through this eight day procedure that would allow the battery to ""reset"" itself, there was no change.Next call, different service rep says, it's not the battery. Those problems are rare. He directs me to return the unit.So, I have a new unit and the same old battery which STILL DOES NOT WORK."
1,Bought two and they are both DOA,"Bought two remanufactured roomba discoveries 4299 considering that you can get two refurbisheds for one brand new. I bought them as gifts. I, myself, have an unrefurbished Discovery which was given to me as a gift (it worked flawlessly since day one). Getting back to my gifts. Unfortunately, one of them doesn't run for more than 10 seconds and the other for about 30 minutes. I have to either return to amazon or call iRobot for repair. That'll be some hefty shipping charges. Stay away from the refurbished (remanufactured) models."
4,Irobot=iluv,"This robotic vacuum is terrific! Easy to use (even though the manual is a bit lacking), easy to clean it, and it does a great job on tile. I live on a sandy island and have lots of dogs and cats and the Rhoomba keeps up with all that ! I love sitting on my patio, having morning coffee, and hearing it whirl around cleaning the house.It does GREAT on tile... but I am guessing that it might not do so well on carpet."
4,Very Please With Roomba 4210,I was apprehensive at first in buying a factory-reconditioned item but have found the product in excellent condition both in appearance and in its operation. I would have never known it was reconditioned. It performs as adverstised and I do not hesitate to give it high marks.
1,iRobot Lacks Quality Control,"I bought the factory-reconditioned iRobot Roomba earlier this year. When I received the Roomba, everything worked except for the remote. However, after just half a year and only about half a dozen usages, the battery no longer maintains its charge. So, now I'll need to junk the entire machine. With so many reconditioned machines, iRobot definitely lacks quality control. So unless iRobot improves its quality control, I would not recommend iRobot vacuums to anyone."
2,Stay away -- bad warranty,"Since this is reconditioned, the warranty doesn't even last a year. My unit went bad after about 9 months and I was just out of luck. They said it would cost $90 to replace!!"
2,nice toy,"- doesnt home into charger...pain to pick it up (the right way) and place it...get a model with a homing sensor- its a pain to clean up the floor of things before letting this loose..at least with a manual vacuum u can get around things you dont want sucked in- low battery life..wish they had supplied another battery- the screw on the virtual wall unit was a pain to remove..had to try 10 diff. bits to unscrew it, finally damaged one. it need 2 D batteries.- cleaning path sucks...had to wait for it to go over and over the same path before it could finally pick up one small speck of dirt- filter doesnt hold dirt well...if you carry it, it sheds picked-up dirt all over, and sometimes dumps the entire thing when u put it down"
4,Love the Roomba but Amazon not so much,"I love the Roomba. It saves me alot of time and picks up better than I expected. I am NOT happy that when I purchased it, the Amazon description said it has a one year warranty and when I receive it, it says 90 days. After multiple emails to Amazon,they changed the website information but will do NOTHING to honor the warranty."
4,Love Roomba! But died after a year,"Mine worked great for the first year, but it died after 1 year 2 months... Hope to get a replacement soon"
5,Great,"This product was delivered early and has been great to have. I ended up buying another one for my Mother. We both love it....good quality, easy to use!"
4,impressed,"Before the purchase I had serious doubts as to the practicality of this item, but because of the price I decided to take a chance. It has taken a while to use to, but I must say I am satisfied with my purchase. It can clean areas that normally would not be touched except for special occassions.My only complaint is that it requires recharging more often than advertised.BillPS I enjoy using it more than my wife"
3,It's a cool gimmick,It works ok. The refurbished ones don't seem to hold the charge as well. It only lasted an hour... instead of two. And it only managed to clean two rooms in that hour. I might be lazy... but even I could do better than that.
3,"iRobot Roomba keeps our floors clean, But gets lost","We bought this item (not as pictured) about a month and a half ago. We run it two to three times a week and it does a pretty good job getting around our small house. It runs for about 1 and a half hours but has forgotten about where it's base is. The pets were curious but did not bother them. All in all it is a nice toy, it does a good job with the open floors and rugs. If you buy one Don't sell your regular vacuum."
5,Great for family with kids,"This has been our new best friend. With three kids under 5, we always have a mess in our main living/kitchen area. At night after they are in bed, we pick everything up off the floor and put the chairs up, and let the little guy go to town. For us, it is quiet enough to watch TV in the same room, and we don't worry about waking up the kids (although ours are pretty sound sleepers). We often will finish cleaning up and let him do the same at the same time. It is great to always have a freshly vacuumed home. It has worked so well, that when our friend brought over her Dyson to see what we might be missing, she was surprised to not find much at all.The Roomba does require some periodic fine tuning and it will need to be emptied every time, but totally worth it as far as we are concerned."
5,Roomba 4210,I had purchased two of the IRobot Roomba 4210s over a month ago.One was a present and the other was mine. Iam extremely satisified with the units. Both units have performed well with no problems. IRobot lets you register the units and supports them as well. The only problem I encountered was on of the units was a present and I ordered it via 3 day faster shipping. I had paid an extra $10.00 shipping to make sure I had it here in time for a birthday. The other unit I ordered it the same day with free shipping. They both showed up on the same day. Should have stayed with free shipping. Other wise good purchase..
4,recomendable,"realmente funciona, Deja El vitropiso relucienteSeria util fuera un poco mas silenciosa"
2,"Great for a clean, empty room! Nice idea, but it's just a gadget","The Roomba was broken when we got it out of the box. Internal gears on the brush were stripped and it was very noisy. It finally didn't clean at all after 2-3 uses and we sent it back.The 1st day we tried to clean a 15x 20 living room with a couch, 2 armchairs, 2 bookcases and 2 end tables. It kept getting stuck in the same corner over and over again - and it left black tire marks on the white carpet. I wish I had a video!It should work OK if you remove all your area rugs and move the furniture to accomodate its artificial unintelligence. BTW, make sure the room is clean beforehand. Sort of defeats the purpose, wouldn't you say?To be safe, get one from a retailer that has a lifetime money back guarantee. They do exist - I found one on the web.P.S. It's been 2 weeks and still waiting for a replacement from iRobot."
2,Nice Idea But Poor Execution,"I bought the Roomba with high hopes. I enjoy gadgets and thought that this would be useful but it just turned out to be a headache. The Roomba continually got stuck on any carpeting it happened upon or tricking spot it could get wedged into. I would come home to find that it just got stuck again and again.I hope that the technology can be refined, but for now this product is not a useful tool. If you have a completely flat floor without any rugs it could work but that still is not a sure thing. Think carefully before purchasing this product. I had to return mine and I'm still waiting for the next generation robot vacuums that are more reliable."
5,My wife is soooo pleased!!!,"It is used everyday, our grandchildren come over daily, and leave a mess! My wife just turns it on, and it cleans everything. This is the best present I have ever bought for the household. Very little maintenance, I may buy another one for our vacation home. Try it and you will LOVE IT!"
3,Roomba,"I like the Roomba, but it makes much more noise than I expected, therefore gets irritating after awhile. Also, it doesn't clean my rug as well as I'd hoped. I would have been upset if I'd spent over $300 on this item, but since I bought it refurbished for less than half that, I can't really complain."
2,Seems good but not in reality,"When it works, it seemed good. It does what you expected. But it just too easy to go bad. After a few use, the first one just don't want to anything else but circling at one spot. Returned it to amazon and got an exchange. Now the second one seems to have some recharge problem, and it does not follow the remote well.My recommendation: Don't buy the reconditioned one even if you want give the Roomba a try. It only comes a 90-day warranty. Buy a new one with one year warranty, and your credit card will extend the warranty another year."
3,OK - but,This is my 2nd remanufactured iRobot Roomba. The first never performed correctly and was exchanged promptly by amazon. The second one is working OK but it is still not as advertised. The battery has yet to obtain a full a charge - despite following the recommendations of the manufacture on how to fully a charge a 'discharged' battery. My Roomba runs about 20 minutes and is done. I have dogs in the house and the dog hair has to be cleaned from the machine after every use. This would be OK if the Roomba could clean a full room before needing to be recharged.
4,Works Great,"I ordered one of these Roombas. Received in excellant condition. Works great on our tile floors, no more sweeping. And entertaining to watch!"
5,Excellent product,"This product really works. After a couple weeks it seemed to pick up a lot less, I realized it wasn't working right. The brushes had quit working. I returned it and they shipped me another refurbished unit. It has been over a year and no additional problems."
2,Roomba Robot,Not What WE expected in performance. Works only for about 25 minutesthen runs out of power. NOT very good.
3,Great but charging unit failed after a month,"I found this to be a great helper. It does not replace a full fledged sweeper by any means, but it does keep the house tidy. It finds hair and stuff in corners that you do not normally reach with a full sized vacuum cleaner.Cons: It did not mate up with the docking station after cleaning, it would stop a couple of inches short of docking.I purchased a reconditioned unit and the charger stopped working after about a month. It has been sent back to IRobot for repair or replacement. I believe at my cost of shipping."
2,I Hate This Thing!!,"We've had our roomba for 9 months. It's impossible to empty out the dirt, dust, hair, etc., that is collected. It takes forever for it to do its job- constantly stalling on rugs and missing spots. I have two dogs and a young child and this is NOT for me. It's annoying, frustrating, and overall not good at cleaning. Today, the thing actually spit out a load of dirt and then spread it all over my kitchen! The storage compartment was completely closed! This thing sucks!"
4,Cool Cleaning toy,"I have 3 dogs and just watching the dogs react with the vacuum was worth it. Actually the floorvac inhaled the dog hair all along the laminated floor that I used it on and I was amazed. When it bumped into objects its trajectory changed just enough to gulp down some more. For the lazy person who wants to get dirt, hair, and other stuff picked up, it was GREAT."
3,"Worked great, for 6 weeks....","The Roomba worked great for about 6 weeks, being used only once every 2-3 days on hardwood and tile floors. Called customer support and sent the system back (appears the 'brush motor' died) and was told it will be 2-3 weeks till a replacement arrives, so now I will have to break out the old vacuum. Seems to me that even a reconditioned unit should have lasted long than 6 weeks.Update... Received a replacement Roomba 4210 from iRobot, and from the looks of it, the replacement that I was sent is a brand new robot (not another reconditioned one) and it appears to be a later model (newer brushes and a different dirt sensor). The replacement unit is also a bit quieter and seems to 'just work better'. I am very satisified with iRobot's customer service and warranty service."
1,BAD,"YOU CANNOT GET THROUGH TO ROOMBA, THAT WOULD MAKE THEIR WARRANTY VOID SINCE YOU CAN'T CONTACT THEM."
2,only good for a short time.,"This unit is good for about a year then it will stop working, spins in circles as dust gets in to the sensor.Customer support will promise you they will send a code stick to fix the problem but I hope you don't mind waiting. I called them over a month ago, 4 phone calls and 3 emailes later and they still have not even shipped the part. I keep getting emails back stating ""If this issue is not resolved to your satisfaction, you may reopen it with in the next 7 days"".How can it be resolved if they never ship the part.BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. THEY PROMISE YOU EVERYTHING BUT DONT DELIVER.SPEND YOUR MONEY ON A GOOD VACUUM."
4,Power Supply not charging,"Howdy,I have laminate flooring. The remanufactured Roomba 4210 I have cleans it very well including lots of cat hair. It was working well up until yesterday. The light on the charger started flashing. I put the Roomba on the dock and now both lights on the dock flash and the power light on the robot flashes red for a very short time about every minute.I've left a note at the manufacturers web sight and tried to find any documentation on the meaning. I'll see what's going on with my vacuum."
1,not good,"the item in question, the roomba worked for about a week then started malfunctioning, now it is completly useless and I dont believe Im allowed to send it back, so I lost my money"
5,See below,"Due to a family emergency, I have been out of town and have not had the opportunity to even open my Roomba. I will prioritize this and respond ASAP."
4,Great Little Vacuum,"If you love to multi task, this little vacuum is for you! I just love doing the dishes and vacuuming at the same time! I would definely recommend. The only I don't love is emptying the vacuum."
2,Roomba Vac,It does a fair job on the hardwood floors. It does not handle the pet hair as well as I had hoped and doesn't do very well with inside corners.
5,This thing is great!,"These Roombas work great! Keep in mind that it will not replace your current vacuum. If you have a dirty house to begin with, these roombas will not clean it for you. They work well as dusters and general maintenance tools. They work best on tile, vinyl or wood flooring. Not so good on carpets. Does really well in the kitchen or bathrooms. Picks up hair and smaller objects but not so good with the big stuff. I gave one to my girl friend and she loves it. It's like having a new pet. I find my self talking to it sometimes, strange? The best feature is it's ability to park and recharge itself. That's really cool. Other than that , I would recommend this thing. Buy one and you'll love yours too!Aireszona, Mesa AZ"
3,Good but not for me,"I bought this as refurbished and the machine is in great working order and I got a great bargain, but the roomba does not do what I need it to. I have two cats and a dog and vacuuming is a never ending battle. The roomba worked to a point but could not clean as effectivly as I can, so I'm sending it back. It came with a 90 day warrenty and many extras which makes buying the refurbished an extra good deal, but I think it is really only good for light work. As well, it takes almost as much time to move things out of the way as it does just to vacuum yourself."
1,Broken Roomba,"When the box arrived, I could hear something rattling around inside it. Bad sign. When I got the Roomba out of the packaging, I also found a few small (tiny) plastic pieces. These turned out to be part of the bracket that held on the clip that kept the brushes in place. So, basically, the Roomba was DOA.Returning the Roomba was quite easy. UPS picked it up the next day. However, my credit card was credited only a day before payment was due."
1,Big mistake!,"I bought a remanufactured Roomba to replace my inoperative unit because iRobot does not repair units out of warranty, but charges $$$ to swap for a new one. The remanufactured unit arrived with a broken part, but I was able to scavenge a replacement from the old unit. Poor quality control in both units. Poor support from iRobot."
3,roooooooooomba,"The first day I got this little robot, I followed it around and wasted alot of time...but the novelty has worn off and it does save me time. It is helpful with my 2 year old who drops a million crumbs and my pet parrot. I use it almost every day. It is a bit noisy, but it is a vacuum cleaner, so I guess that makes sense. It does not seem to hold the charge for longer than 1 hour, even though it is supposed to work for 2 hours? Sometimes it gets stuck wedged on the wall or other strange position, then the battery drains. Overall, I do like it."
2,What happened?,I had high hopes for this item....bought as a wish gift for my wife....worked great at first....in about 4 mos. would no longer hold a charge....changed battery but did not make a difference...now on the fence as should buy another or continue to try to fix this one.....good for touch up cleaning but will not totally replace a vacuum
3,It's Good but not Great,My Roomba is adequate but it does not pick up alot of hair. I have twoWelsh Corgis and it does not do the job with them. I admit they shed more than the average dog.
1,Never got the correct Roomba,"Can't really give it any stars because I never got the correct Roomba. Ordered it twice, got the right box but the wrong Roomba twice. Did not try again. Amazon was great with returning the product and refund. Would like to have received the correct Roomba. Seems like a good price for the money."
1,Not Happy,I just opened my Roomba 4299 and well it's not a 4299 it's an old 4130 model. The box is for a 4299 etc but once you open it hey wrong model!! I DO NOT like getting less than I paid for! I realize this is refurbished but hey send the right model!!
5,happy birthday,This was a birthday gift for a little girl who loves Tinkerbell. It will be a collectible she can put up and keep and pass on to her children.
1,One big problem...,"While this book is fascinating and well written, its fundamental problem is that it refers to the Yankee dynasty in the past tense. Excuse me, but didn't the Yankees win the American League championship 8 months ago, and go deep into the World Series? And currently, the Yankees have the best record in the American League and are favored to reach the World Series for an incredible sixth time in eight years.While the chronicling of the last few years is fanastic, the title and tone of the book shows Olney's obvious bias against the latest Yankee dynasty and the distinct possibility that there will be another World Series in the Bronx this October."
1,Looking forward to the sequel,Buster Olney should be fired for this. Seriously. This guy wrote the obit for a team that wasn't dead. How about the sequel about how the red sox will never win again for like 86 more years
2,Hello? How about the 2004 season?,I understand ancient history is important to understanding the current situation in the Balkans or the Middle East. I was floored by the scope of this book. Where is the 2004 choke against the Red Sox? Had this been recommended to me by Amazon I probably would have bought on the strength of the title and been disappointed. Just goes to show Amazon has my number.
5,Amazing book....,"This is an amazing book. A must read for any Yankee fan or baseball fan.Buster Olney's writing style is very tangential... but by the end of the book, he tells the whole story and gives you an amazing plethora of content about the Yankees during their dynasty.The minute i finished it, i wanted to go back to page 1 and immediately start reading it over again from scratch.its like that movie you want to watch over and over.He tells the back story behind all the yankee players, the coaches, the front office and everyone who was pivotal in making the dynastic Yankees what they were.Its an absolute must read for any Yankee fan. Fantastic fantastic piece of writing."
5,A MUST READ!,"A must read, ESPECIALLY if you are a Yankees fan (although you would think the opposite!). It gives you insight into all sorts of things about Game 7 (and the Yankees in general) that will have you saying ""Wow!"" to yourself. There are so many more little ""what if's"" that could have changed the outcome of that game, long before Torre's decision to play the infield in for Luis Gonzalez's last at bat. You'll also understand why the ""winning the World Series is the only goal"" attitude worked so well for the 1998-2001 teams, as opposed to the post-2001 Yankee rosters of All-Stars.You might want to wait until closer to the release of the 2001 World Series boxset however... you will DEFINITELY want to see Game 7 again after reading this book!"
4,Feel the Pain,"For Yankees fans, this book makes you re-live the pain of the final inning of Game 7 of the 2001 World Series. Why would you want to do a thing like that? It also happens to be a good read on how the Yankees teams of 1996-2001 were built, perhaps providing an excellent roadmap for how the current Yankees can get back on the path to postseason glory. Here's a hint: While adding expensive, Hall of Fame bound free agents every winter may create the appearance of guaranteeing World Series rings, the results show the exact opposite effect. Where have you gone Gene Michael, our (Yankees) nation turned it's lonely eyes to you..."
4,Very insightful-- even for Yankee Fans.,"I did not know what to expect from Olney's book. Being a die hard Yankee and baseball fan, I thought I knew just about everything. Man, was I wrong. Olney brings his first hand knowledge to every chapter. (he covered the Yankees for some years with the NY Times) Readers are enlightened at the behind-the-scenes events that the book brings out learning of trades that never were, some never even known about. The book gives a detailed look about the most recent Yankees dynasty that ended on Nov. 4, 2001, starting way back in the late 80's and detailing every move that brought the end to one of the greatest dynasties ever."
4,"Good approach, good execution","Not being a fan of Buster Olney's writing while at the NYT, or now at ESPN, I didn't have great expectations of this book. However, this is a surprisingly insightful look at the Yankee dynasty, delivered in an interesting format.Interspersing action from Game 7 of the 2001 World Series with a look at the members of the Yankees' organizations - not only the players, but also Steinbrenner, Cashman, Gene Michael, etc. - Olney examines the building of the dynasty, and how it finally came apart.I think all baseball fans, regardless of whether they love or hate the Yankees, should enjoy this one. Simply put, it's a good baseball book, and Olney does a terrific job."
4,History in the making,"Well written. Being a huge baseball fan, and specifically a Yankee one, This was an excellent book.It gives a realisitc view of what in fact was happenning to the Yankees.The game was changing as well as the Yankees."
1,Much like cardboard,"I have tried and enjoyed many other fiber crackers. This one I did not like. It just had NO flavor, and no matter what I put on top of it, nothing seemed to help. However my sister liked. I would not personally recommend it. The only reason I gave it one star was because my sister liked."
2,Watch for assembly flaws,"This is a great-looking chair and my 13-month-old loved it, but both the floor model and the one I brought home were both poorly upholstered -- the stitching was off in the front where the seat meets the base, so some of the fabric and the trim were left unattached at the seam. There was also a little hole in the fabric, and some of the staples that hold the fabric to the base on the bottom missed the base entirely and were just hanging loosely in the fabric. Needless to say, I returned the chair and went with Pottery Barn Kids' ""Anywhere Chair"" instead. More expensive and a little more casual-looking, but the slipcover is removable and washable, which is a huge bonus."
4,7 temas apocalipticos,"La primera vez que escuche el disco quede impresionado de que estos tipos ya con 40 años y más esten haciendo musica tan eclectica y alternativa, se nota ya que el disco tiene solo 7 canciones y dura mas de 40 minutos, eso tiene que ver ya que temas como KAREN REVISITED tiene un final sonico noise que dura unos 4 minutos, cada dia creo que mientras mas largas las canciones de sonic youth, mejores son ya que gran parte es improvisacion y experimentacion. El disco es de los mejores que tengo de sonic y temas como disconnection notice o the empty page hacen valer el precio del disco por si solo. Muy recomendable y para mi uno de los mejores discos del año 2002."
5,Great Art Rock,"This album is one of their best. I thought the last SY album,""NYC Ghosts & Flowers"" was a classic. Great spoken word type lyrics mixed with their brand of guitar noise. It comes as no surprise that the new material on this record continues in very much the same approach. They seem to get better with age. The Jim O'Rourke touches are fantastic. I hope they continue to make intelligent music like this and give me a reason to keep buying rock albums. With so much garbage in the music industry to sift thru, it's nice to know they are still around, making great uncompromised music."
4,amazon is silly,"The picture provided is for the release ""A Thousand Leaves"", not ""Murray Street"". How could they get that wrong if the cover of ""Murray Street"" is the street sign?"
2,disappointing. very disappointing,"its a shame. sonic youth have been one of my favorite bands for years and they're new album, 'murray street,' is certainly their most tepid. they are trying much too hard to be accessible.unlike their last album, 'nyc ghosts and flowers,' which was a much more textured and interesting affair (and amongst their best), 'murray street,' relies on tired chord changes, lukewarm lyrics, and a complete abandon of the challenging noise i love so much. all of the songs sung by thurston moore are among his weakest.in the albums 8 tracks only 1 is completely salvagable. 'plastic sun,' is one of the angriest songs kim gordon has ever performed, and it is a highlight amidst dross. i would reccomend any (literally) sonic youth album over this."
2,I Hope The Muzak Phase is Not Their Last,"My thoughts are pretty well summed up in the review title. I'm a big fan since 1988. I've got all their recordings. This is their worst by a mile. Unfortunately, the album comes across as a series of lifeless cliches of their own style, like some sort of phoned-in caricature. And it's not very melodic; in fact it's really quite flat. Could it be that they've exhausted the genre which they created? I hope not, but at least they left about a dozen great records in their wake!Maybe they're just getting old, I mean Kim is turning 50 this year! I don't blame them. I'm pushing 40 and certainly am not as sharp as I was in my mid-twenties......"
2,Goo Goo Ga Choo,"This is ""classic rock""? Sounds more like Eric Satie's stupor at CBGB's. Didn't the Beatles cover this sleepiness with ""I Am The Walrus"" thirty years ago? Only a handful of downtown New Yorkers who own (and even listen to) Laurie Anderson could possibly relate to these lyrics. Get off the Prozac."
5,The Best of Sonic Youth !!!!,"This record is the best of Sonic Youth's work. It contains completely beautiful noise art ever. Actually, I am a fan of Sonic Youth and Thurston Moore for many years. I bought almost every records of them except the extremely rare ""Sonic Youth"" 1st album that out of print. For me, I rate this new record ""Murray Street"" with new member ""Jim"" 5 star without thinking. Balance of Noise and Art since Sonic Youth formed thier band. A MUST BUY!"
5,Sonic youth for a new generation,"in a day and age when 95% of all music being released lately has been made to sound generic and ultimately [stinks], it is refresing to hear music again that inspires and is interesting and daring when only following rules that they make themselves. probably the best thing released all last year. if you care at all about the future of music this is an essential listen. sonic youth proves that rock n roll though withering is not dead."
4,A Decent SY Effort,"I've enjoyed this cd, especially tracks 2 & 4. It hasn't left my car in the week since I bought it. That said, it isn't as all-around wonderful as ""Daydream Nation"" or as comically quirky as the Ciccone Youth record. Still, this is a decent effort by a still-relevant band, and the mac-friendly media kit is a nice plus."
1,"disappointing, confusing and confused","I enjoyed Beverly's first bookm as well as the film based on it. This book resembles the first only in occasional vivid passages. What ever became of quality editors? Donofrio thanks two in her acknowledgments, but why? They passed on a text that is wildly unstructured. The Medjugorje trip simply doesn't work as a structural device. On p. 195 we read of a congregation in San Luciano that ""over twelve centuries ago, ... was entrusted to Brazilian monks."" Apparently Christianity made it to Brazil in the 8th century, about 7 centuries before Columbus! A silly mistake, but that's what editors are for. This is Viking Press! BTW, why, without explanation, is her junkie husband Raymond Boudreau in the first book, but Stephen Budrow in this one? Beverly is talented, but truly needs some writing discipline -- and better editors."
5,Really opened my eyes,"As a Lutheran, I never really learned anything about Mary, other than the fact she was the mother of Jesus. But while at the library one afternoon, I was walking down an aisle and my eyes fell upon this book. It was tucked away behind some bigger books. I'm not sure why it stuck out but I picked it up, took it home, and read it. It was wonderful! It really made me more interested in Mary. While reading it one night, I smelled roses, which I found really strange, but oddly soothing. On the next page it says that when Mary is around, people say they smell roses.I thought this was a wonderful book."
5,A Unique Love Story,"For those who have a bond with the Blessed Mother, or yearn for one. Not your typical story of saintly lives and far-away miracles -- but one of a real and ""flawed"" life...with a passionate underlying spirituality, and devotion to Mary. A book to read, and share with others."
4,Wonderful testimony,"This is a very beautiful and touching retelling by Beverly Donofrio of her own conversion and repentance under the guidance of the Mother of God. Although I don't always agree with Donofrio's personal opinions and she sometimes makes some rather strange statements, I enjoyed this book nonetheless. It is a powerful testimony both for the effectiveness of the intercessions of the Blessed Virgin Mary and for the power of a mother's love -- and how those powerful forces can change a person and a person's life permanently."
4,Lifelong Unitarian,"Even as a lifelong Unitarian, I found this book interesting and helpful. The ""Mother myth"" is such an important one for our world today. Even though Mary equivalents are found throughout our New Age culture (Kwan Yin, etc.), I believe that we can't ignore that we are fundamentally a Judeo-Christian culture which means that Mary is the easiest and most natural mother-figure for us to relate to and seek 'support' from."
3,Not quite what I expected,"It wasn't clear to me when I picked up this book that it was an autobiography of sorts. I was a little disinterested in the beginning to read about the author's personal lifestyle (young single mom, drugs, bad relationships, etc.), but came to be fascinated by her journey of faith and life improvement. I must say though that the historical tidbits about Mary (and even some of the saints) and especially her Medjugorje trip intrigued me the most."
2,Reads like a book deal gone wrong...,"I read this in its entirety one night in an airport while my flight was delayed. I'll assume some literary agent was impressed with what a free-spirited opinionated character Aschenbrand was, and offered her a book deal. The result is mildly entertaining - but an awful lot like reading a blog. It doesn't say much, uses amateurish style, and only occasionally makes you laugh. (I dig the cover, however)"
3,Ranting Crap,"Very curious to the tittle of the book, and little excerpt I read online. To my surprise, I actualy read the entire book, hoping to find the GOOD part. Didnt find it. Mostly rambles about misc. crap from jews to lesbians to family. Did not feel satisfied, waste of time."
1,It's not about taboo but about her respecting herself. Grow up girl.,"The book reads as if a 13 year old is doing everything they can to get a rise out of their parents in order to be able to write about their reactions. And lets face it, anyone can tell sensationlist stories and write a book abou it. But she's not a adolescent she's 29! Miss thang just needs to grow up and respect herself and her family. John Kerry and Bill Clinton would be ashamed to have her as a daughter."
4,Trust This Bush?,"If Alex DeToqueville (""Democracy in America""), Anita Liberty (""Heal the Hurt By Hating""), and Douglas Coupland (""Generation X"") were to be spun together in a literary centrifuge, the end result would be Periel Ashcenbrand's ""The Only Bush I Trust Is My Own.""The slacker lingo, ""he goes/she goes becomes a bit tedious at times, but Achenbrand straps the reader in check with her 120 mph stream of consciousness wit.Visceral, compassionate, and bitingly funny, her observations about sexuality, right-wing Christianity, and post-911 relations between Jews and Arabs come together in a thought-provoking commentary on the current state of early 21st century affairs.Trust this bush, she won't let you down."
4,Good standard delay pedal,Great little pedal for delay. Not a lot of fine tuning controls but enough to get it right without too many complicated knobs. If you get this you won't need the slap echo or reverb of Danelctro because the short delay sounds exactly like them.
3,Good book...but.,"This was a good book with an decent plot and interesting characters. I've been reading this series since the beginning and my only criticism is that Marti is kind of dry. After reading several of these books, I still don't really feel like I know her or her likes and dislikes, what motivates her. I know she loves her family but beyond that Marti is a mystery. I liked the last book a lot better."
5,How to create a healthful environment at home or at work,We got this book as a wedding gift and didn't really notice it at first. Then the author's unique world view took hold. Now we consult it everytime we make a purchase for my home or office. There's nothing else like it anywhere.
2,This book needs to stick to ergonomics.,"While I did learn several things about ergonomics, I finally put the book down when I got tired of the preaching. Many of the author's topics were not on subject and, instead, were rantings about the time we spend watching television or other pet peeves of the authors. It got really old. I was looking forward to learning how to design my home. I didn't need the nagging. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Of Horses and Men,"Thoroughbred racing is a story more complex than simply which horse finished first. In this engaging ""behind the scenes"" look, the author lifts the veil to reveal an array of characters and events that have shaped the Breeders' Cup. Obviously well-researched, this book provides in-depth portraits of the Breeders' ""players"". Written in an amiable voice that takes the reader deep into the world of professional horse racing, one gets a clear sense of the monies, time and emotions invested by jockeys and owners alike. Avoiding pondering, pedantic rhetoric, this book is written by and for horse racing aficionados. Each chapter profiles winners, losers and horse whisperers and makes for entertaining reading. If you or someone you know is interested in horse racing, I recommend this book be included on your holiday gift list."
5,Triviet Review,"This product is great for serving all sizes of dishes. It makes great gifts and I own 4 of them myself. For Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, passing the dishes of food is so easy with these expandable, handled trivets.Progressive International Expandable Trivet"
2,"One so good, one so bad","Against Her Will starring Walter Matthau was the third and final installment in the "" Incident Series "" and was as fantastic as the first and second. Anything he appears in I find always hold may attention.The second part of the Double Feature was a movie called Wounded Heart.This was truly awfull. The lead actress played by Paula Devicq had very little talent and appeared to play the role as if to say-- I ampretty and that should be enough for any audience.Unfortunately both shows are paired together.It is a shame they did not leave out ""Wounded Heart"" and just include another Walthau movie."
3,against her will...,Another installment of the incident series. A young girl is being used as a guinea pig at a psychiatric clinic against her will. Judge Bell is totally against helping her but Cobb puts his foot down. It takes a lot of work but Mr. Cobb finds the proof he needs to help this girl.
5,Wounded Heart,Wounded Heart is one of my favorite romantic TV movies of all times. A country girl-city girl who forgot who she was but found it again along with the love of her life. Perfect.
5,The album to beat for best of 2006,"Well, here it is already, the year halfway over, but by far, Shearwater is out of the gate this year and seemingly there are few bands in the race for what could be a slam-dunk for record of the year. Jonathan Meiburg has found the soul of Mark Hollis, consumed it whole, and regurgitated it into a stark beauty that we haven't heard in years. This album could actually be in the running for best of the decade. If you like Shearwater, you're going to love this album. If you've never heard of Shearwater, delve here and let it wash over you."
1,good show but waste of time,"If you are like me and you're looking to buy and/or rent this ""complete"" series and the date on your calendar is 2011 or later, don't. Although this was a very good show and I enjoyed watching the episodes, you should be aware that the title ""complete"" series is a bit misleading. The show never got picked up for a second season and ended the 16th episode (the last episode in the series) left a lot to be desired and a lot of loose ends. So since there's no hope of this ever gtting picked up for a second season. If you like a lot of loose ends... then this series is perfect for you."
1,subtitles,"the movie was great....the subtitles ruined it. with todays electronic know how, how can something like this happen? is there anyone out there who can remake this movie for the american market?"
5,Jon Blake,"Please ammend your actors list for this movie, it is Jon Blake not Jon Black. A great actor who had his career cut short. He passed away 30th May 2011, may he RIP"
3,Good Movie Light on Image Quality,"This is a good World War I movie that focuses on the heroic efforts of an Australian Light Horse Brigade and its critical role in an attack on the town of Beersheba, held by the Turks.Unfortunately, the image quality of my import copy is sub-standard but not enough that I couldn't still enjoy the film. As previously mentioned by another reviewer, the subtitles do not always match the actual dialogue but contrary to that post, I was able to turn off the subtitles. I would have rated the product 4 stars if it were not for those shortcomings."
3,"5-star story, 2-star DVD production","Like so many others, I wanted to replace my tattered VHS copy of this great Australian film. Sadly, the DVD I received was no improvement. The most intense part of the movie, the charge and battle itself, was so grainy as to be barely visible and the sound dropped out entirely much of the time. The rest of the film was of acceptable--though not typical DVD--quality."
1,The Lighthorsemen,Concur with other reviews on poor picture quality. It would have been better if they had just sent me the poor quality VHS tape they copied it from than the horrible DVD that I received. I sent it back in disgust!
4,The Lighthorsemen,"I bought this DVD to replace an old VHS tape in my DVD history collection. The quality was good for an import, which is the first time I purchased one. The historical story, which is based on a true story, reflects a time in the Middle East during WWI with a good and accurate story line. For history buffs, I recommend this movie for a period in history where there is very few DVD's available other than Gallipoli, or Lawrence of Arabia."
1,The Lighthorsemen,A poor quality copy. Shaky and blurry. I suspect that this DVD was pirated in China and may very well be illeagle.
1,shipping ripoff,"I liked the product so I tried to order 20. $20.00 for product $30.00 for shipping, whats wrong with this place??"
5,Solid Gold Berry Balance,My female toy poodle was having difficulty making it through the night without urinating. I discovered that she had high ph urine readings. Within a few weeks of starting her on the Berry Balance she normalized and has no problems now for three months. Excellent product.
3,Solid Gold is great,"But, our vet recommended we not use this product as too much acid in the urine can cause a specific type urinary stone. Our dog kept getting the bacterial infection that lead to stones, so we thought we would give this a try. Would probably be best benefitting a dog without such a high risk of stones."
3,Not sure.,Still had to go to the vet to get some medicine and wipes. From what I have read the supplement does work. I have no issues with it but I am not sure if my Huskey is getting any benifit.
5,Works Well For Our Labradoodle,"Keeps our dog's chronic UTIs in check. Vets cannot figure out his problem and we were tired of spending thousands on vet bills and medicine, not to mention the issue of keeping a dog on medicine. Their quality control may not be the best though. This is the second time I've ordered it and the supplement is darker this time and our dog likes it less. If you have a picky eater it may be a problem.Update: 9/29Our dog has only had one UTI in the year he has been on this supplement. That UTI was a result of us testing whether he ""outgrew"" his chronic UTIs by not giving him the berry supplement for a week. That won't happen again, at least not anytime soon. Two of these containers have lasted us an entire year giving it to him daily. Well worth the $36 for a year of no vet bills."
5,Berry Balance,"Vet recommended it for my old dog, since passed away, to help his kidney function. five more words required, why?"
3,good,i havent seen a large difference in my dog but she likes to eat this stuff and it seems to be making her bladder problems better
3,A bit disappointed in the formula..,"This formula is a great formula but for one detail that is very important for alot of our dogs. It has rice powder in it, and for a dog that has an intolerance/allergy to rice and grains, it is a big NO NO. So I""m torn on the review..I wish they didn't put the rice powder in it, because i know it works, as I've used it on dogs before that were not allergic to grains.Wish the company would take that rice out of there, I have no clue why it would even be IN there???"
5,good product,it cleared my dog's crystals that were causing the swelling all you hafve to do is sprinkle it in the food and she loved it
4,Dam Busters review,"Having seen this movie many times, the result is vey satisfying each time I see it. The characters play their parts with great skill and the tension of the activity comes across to the viewer."
2,This movie deserves a better DVD,The movie itself is good - but it's marred by lousy audio and miserable image quality with poor tonal range in the middle values. No subtitles either.
4,A surprising gem,"I found this movie on cable and immediately wanted it for my library. The DVD itself is a good, clean copy with no unwanted digitizing artifacts. As is common with releases of older films, there are no extras on the DVD.The film itself was a joy for me to watch. I knew the outlines of the story, in which a secret, innovative weapon was developed to attack the Ruhr dams during World War II. What made it special was that this is one of a SMALL handful of films in which the engineering process is dramatized well. Not only is the engineer the lead of the story, but he does not work miracles; the weapon progresses from idea, through concept, subscale models, and full scale use, with problems and setbacks at each stage.The acting style is a little dated now, and one distracting (but historically true) element is that one character's black dog is named ""nigger"", which I found distracting. Still, this is a movie I will enjoy watching many times."
4,3 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Michael Redgrave carries the first half and action carries the second half in this true story of Britain's bouncing bombs; though the movie is a tad dated (wanna guess what one of the pilot's black dog is named?) it's well-made enough to still be entertaining 50 years later.
1,Be careful buying this title,"I ordered and received this DVD, but to my great disappointment, it was delivered in PAL format (formatted for European and other foreign DVD players), so it wouldn't work on my American DVD player due to incompatability. I attempted to have it replaced, but the supplier infomed me that they wouldn't exchange it for the correct format since I had opened it (how was I to know that it was not the correct format unless I tried to play it?) In disgust, I threw it away and ordered another copy (which turned out to be cheaper) from another online store, which arrived in the proper format. So much for buying through Amazon!"
5,fun and uncensored,"An entertaining movie that has inspired other movies and remakes. The true story of a plan to destroy a German dam during WWII. A clever scientist comes up with a theory and a squadron is put together to put the plan into action. Suspense, action, and drama.Those familiar with Star Wars may notice a similarity between the X-wing approach to the drop zone and the bomber approach to the dam. (""The Dam Busters"" was made in 1955.)If shown on TV, the original film is often shortened. (They often leave out the minor story of the pilot's pet dog.)The film got one Oscar nomination."
1,Terrible Print of Vintage British War Film,"Ripoff. This print is a cheap transfer from a low-resolution and contrast VHS copy.Excellent acting by Todd, Redgrave and others -- all spoiled by such an inferior print.No extras, no subtitles, scratchy audio.DVD also arrived severely scratched. It had been bouncing around inside the case."
1,VHS Copy,Think my title says it all..yet another craptacular ripoff vhs to dvd transfer...such a shame as this is the second ww2 movie i have had this issue with(the heros of telmark) being the other oh well guess i will wait til its on TCM
4,Polio survivor from 1952,"I've read many books and articles on Post-Polio syndrome. They've all been helpful in some ways, but Postpolio Syndrome by Julie K. Silver, MD has probably been the most helpful. It's not really designed for the survivors but more for the professionals dealing with survivors. As a result, if you're not a professional you should have at least an ordinary dictionary handy, if not a medical dictionary. Because the chapters deal with different issues the professional faces you can pick and choose which ones apply for you. Each chapter is written by a different expert in the field. The only downside I found is that each chapter starts with a description of what postpolio syndrome is. By the end of the book, you're skipping that part. I've been dealing with postpolio syndrome for 22 years. As I age new things have occurred. This book has caught me up on how many of those things are related to the postpolio."
2,Not for cats!,"This is not for any cat that I have. The ""mini cat cow bell"" is very much like a fishing bell, just slightly smaller. That is very big for a cat to be wearing. There is nothing ""mini"" about this bell. Maybe for a dog about 60lbs or so.length 1"" x 3/4"" - picture that hanging on you cat, they won't be happy and neither will you."
3,The size of this bell is almost as big as my adult cat's ear!,"The bell itself measures 1"" wide, 3/4"" deep, and 1 1/8"" tall. It is almost as big as the size of my adult cat's ear. It weighs about 3/8 oz(10 g).I think it is too big and slightly heavy for my cat to wear.I would give this bell the following scores --Quality: 5 starsPracticality: 2 stars"
1,"Not ""mini""","I bought this bell for my rabbit thinking it would be the perfect thing for him so my husband and i could hear were he is. Ok... so the add clearly says, ""mini"" cat cow bell, and when i put it on my bunny he could not lift his head up. This bell is no were near as small as it leads you to think. it is approx half an inch long! that's no mini bell in my book! Completely DISsatisfied with it!"
3,Dog Uno is fun ...,this is a fun dog lovers version of Uno but I my kids think Go Bark Card Game is the end all of Dog Games. Try both for a puppy lovers party.
1,What year is this 1998?,"If I could give this thing negative stars I would. It only works with Internet Explorer. Come. On. I bought this for its remote manageability, I may as well have gotten a $100 dumb switch. It has connectivity for Sun servers, USB, and PS/2. Now... If they are aware that there are other platforms that you may like to connect a KVM to then why the hell would they limit control of those servers to freaking Internet Explorer? Go elsewhere if you want a real KVM. This wasn't the cheapest KVM on the market and I would have paid more for one that actually works."
1,brought tears to my eyes,"i am a vietnam vet and the song ""armed forces radio"" tore me up...""ride to the wall"" brought tears to my eyes...the tracks ""rolling thunder"" and ""gotta get outa this place"" were heart-wrenching - the whole album is that way...and i gave it 5 stars don't know why it came up 1..."
3,Good General Info - Specifics are Dated,"The good news is the book still contains relevant information, even after the bust. The principles are straightforward, if somewhat simplistic (for example - a bargain property will be a bargain based on price, terms, rental or resale markets, location, condition, zoning or occupancy factors). The 2nd edition introduces the reader to some internet resources - some of which are still good. So, it contains some useful general knowledge and is a fair introduction to the timeless principles of real estate investing.On the other side of the coin, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since 2003 when this book was published. It is good foundational background, but is probably a bit dated given the 2007-2009 real estate recession on the specifics."
4,"Sorry, thought this move was darling!","Oh pooh-pooh on all you artheads. Yes, the movie's fluffy. Yes it's kind of a big-screen TV movie. But it's a WHOLE lot of fun and I've always just loved it. Who can resist all those wonderful scenes where they play-act meeting each other for the first time? I loved this move and am simply waiting for it to come out on DVD. *thhhhhhpt!*"
1,Actionless and emotionless exploration of sex and marriage.,"Despite game attempts by Tim Matheson and Kate Capshaw to generate heat, ""A Little Sex"" fails to ignite a single spark. With a script entirely devoid of situational tension or even tittilation, the viewer is left wondering why this film was made. When I first saw this movie, in a theater in the year of its release, I would've walked out had I been the one to drive. (I later had the misfortune of producing a cut-down trailer for TV.) I hadn't walked out on a movie since ""Juggernaut"" in 1974 or 1975. The only recommendable thing about this movie is the fact that you'll be watching it on video and will have something (the tape itself) upon which to vent your rage. You will be in a rage when you've wasted time on what could possible be the most boring movie of all time. Don't believe me? Give it a try, but when you start feeling the life-force being sucked right out of your skull, don't say that ralph@loop.com didn't warn you!"
5,Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution,"This book shows me why Abraham Lincoln should be called the ""Father of Our Country"" ( rather than George Washington)."
4,Compelling,"These 7 essays were a compelling look at the Civil War, a war that McPherson calls the ""2nd American Revolution."" Easy to read. Another McPherson masterpiece. Could have been edited down a bit."
5,For the motivated student,"The 5 books in this series were incredibly helpful for blowing away the USMLE. If you want to barely pass, get First Aid and hope that is enough (it's not). The questions in these books were very difficult, but after suffering through them then reading the explanations I felt very prepared for the USMLE."
3,Not indicative of USMLE step I,"These books contain questions that are much more difficult than the actual board exam. The explanations are helpful, but using these books just isn't very efficient."
4,Horse crazy,"I bought this as a gift for my grandaughter who is horse crazy. She has seen it at least 50 times, but watches it from start to finish as though it were the first viewing. It is a good child's story."
5,Beautifully done! Wonderful for children!,This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen! I highly recommend this for a child of any age. I hope Dreamworks continues to produce movies like this one. Children should be children and not fed a daily diet of violence and innuendo. This DVD is wonderful! The animation is breathtaking; stunningly beautiful.A must have for your collection!
5,My 1st Experience Ordering With Amazon,"I ordered ""Spirit"" DVD's ... one for my granddaughter and one to keep at our house when she visits ... upon receiving many good recommendations about Amazon.Thank you for shipping them so quickly and I will definitely order again wtih you.Have a good day!"
4,This movie has Spirit!,"I went to the theatre to see this movie with my then 4 & 3 yr old girls. I had to fight back tears in certain areas of the film!-That's how much emotion this movie brings (perhaps due to the storyline and because I'm a Mom). I agree that the sensitive preschoolers should wait a year or two to view this one. Nothing really bad - perhaps just scary for a young one.I enjoyed the fact that the horses didn't ""speak english"" but winnied & neighed and communicated with each other in their own way. Sort of lets the viewer decide what they are really saying to each other. The narration tells you all you need to know - the rest is left to your own imagination.My kids thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted to talk about it when it was over! We have added it to our own library of movies & they request to watch it at least once every other week.Good movie! Great story! Worth the money!1smileycat :-)"
4,Loved it!,"I'm a professional horse person and most horse movies are painful to watch because they are produced by people that know nothing about horses. Once you get past the horse's eyebrows, there are very few things in this movie that took me out my acceptable limits for cartoon horses. The horses moved correctly, the sounds were correct and I loved it that they didn't speak human to each other. Major Kudos to Dreamworks for getting the basics down so I could join them in this fantasy world. Oh, and the music didn't really work for me, but everything else did, and that is really saying something."
1,Politically Correct twaddle,"Politically correct twaddle. There are three main characters in the story; a horse, a Sioux and the US Cavalry. Guess which one is the bad guy. Yes, you got it, the Cavalry, and they're so dense an animal with a brain the size of a walnut can outwit them. Buy ""Ice Age"" instead, it's a lot better than this rubbish."
1,NOT a movie for children!,"We took our 3 and 5 year olds when it played in the theaters, and we walked out. They were crying and scared, and very upset by the amount of violence and the repeated cruel treatment the horse received. The animation was good, but the content is not at all acceptable for children."
1,Nasty,this is rebecca back with spirit i love horses but this was horrificly awful the horses had very bushy eyebrows and that other horse that was brown and white that pooped in the cage eew! i won't accept this spirit and that other horse that was brown and white just babbles this is just spiritless no spirit at all it won't play as well the smurfs justin bieber never say never the super mario bros super show so random amazing world of gumball toy story the little drummer boy are all much better shame on dreamworks for making the horses babble i just liked the bryan adams music and that was all gulp
2,Borrrrrrrrring,"I bough this video for my kids and just after 15 minutes of watching it, we turned it off. Although the animation is good, everything else is boring. I almost fell asleap myslef. Do not buy this movie for your kids."
3,This movie is ok,"This movie is not the best movie of all,but its ok.I'm not really into horses,so that may be why."
1,IT STINKS!!!,What a load of politically correct TRASH. It deserves ZERO stars. Don't waste your money. This movie is ridiculously violent. It portrays all white Americans as idiots or murderous villans. In the end it is little more than a lousy music video for Bryan Adams
1,don't like renting this,"I did not like the quality. It really sucked. If I waited a while-like two hours- the quality KIND OF improves, but still sucks."
4,Great Movie/Incredible Delivery Time,My little girls absolutely love this movie! The delivery time was also exceptional. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because I think that the price is a bit high for an older movie.
2,Horse is hero when he burns down forest,"Although there were many things I liked about this movie-- the animation and the horses not talking, the personality of ""Spirit"", the drawbacks were more than distracting. Several sections were offensive, such as the scene where Spirit is the hero for killing people and setting the forest on fire when he sabatoges a railroad camp. I admire freedom and ""the spirit that can't be broken"" and the Native American way of life, but that doesn't mean we should celebrate destruction, even when done by a horse character, or villainize all of the American settler heritage."
2,utter agony,"The main editorial review calls this movie, ""utterly enjoyable and marvelous to look at"". I couldn't disagree more with the first point, and will only partially concede the second. The primary character is in dire agony 99% of the time. I don't watch animated children's movies to become depressed or angry. For my taste, these films should be light and fun, with just enough dread and hardship to stir empathy for the characters. This film goes way overboard with the pain and suffering element. I felt the same about ""Lion King"". If you liked L.K., this might be your cup of tea. The color and images are gorgeous, and the realism of expressing the horses' interactions in gestures and natural sounds rather than dialog is appealing. If you're like me though, and prefer something enjoyable, you might rerun ""Aristocats"", ""Jungle Book"", or even ""The Little Mermaid""."
2,Give me a break!,"When this movie came out in theatres I thought, wow, I'll probably love this movie since I'm ""horse crazy"". Then when I saw it I said to myself, ""Give me a break""! It might not be as bad as The Lion King but it's pretty bad.Would they make up their minds already? First the horse is happy, then sad, happy, then sad, and so on. The horse having a voice was pretty wierd too but it was ok because that way you could know what he was thinking and also little kids might enjoy that. And the whole story is so boring! I do not recommend this movie for children or adults.Nori from USA"
3,"great movie for adults, too intense for kids","A good movie with superb animation and a clever plot. I felt I was watching an IMAX movie. The horses speak through their facial movements (especially the eyebrows). Unfortunately we found it theatrical, too much ""in-your-face"" and overly intense for my three year old and twelve year old kids. The Brian Adams songs were too intense as well. Nothing subtle or sweet about this one. A great movie for adults rather than children."
1,If only I could rate this 0 stars,"As a teenager with a younger sister, I tend to see most of the kids movies out in theaters. However, this is the first time I have ever fallen asleep in a movie (and believe me, I've seen Jimmy Neutron). The only time I woke up was when my sister got bored and crawled in my lap to rest. Waste of money! For a good story with humor and a great message go see Lilo and Stitch!"
1,Violent,"We saw this movie in a theater. It was nearly impossible to follow the movie due to so many children crying and horrified parents standing and dragging their children out of the theater. This movie contains scenes with guns, shooting and killing, intense chase scenes, nasty soldiers and a seemingly dead horse that threw the 7 yr old next to us into hysterics. Spirit may look like a cute horsey movie for the little ones, but it is entirely innapropriate for the younger set. If you're old enough that the violence and guns don't bother you, you'll probably find the movie insipid anyways. I have no idea who the producers of Spirit thought would enjoy it... no one we know did."
1,The Only Reason This Is A One Star Review Is Because There IS NO Zero,"Okay, let's bite the bullet and start off with the basic truth--this is, quite possibly, THE worst animated movie. Ever.I haven't seen one worse!The reasons? Well, several:1)STORY-ridiculous lies. I don't even want to discuss it.2)ANIMATION-horrible. In trying to make the characters both horses and people, they succeed in doing neither.3)MUSIC-you know, it's insulting to call what they put into this movie ""MUSIC"".That pretty much sums it up. For those of you who want it clearer:Disney pwn-zors this junk!!"
4,overall a well done film,overall this is a well done film. Well animated tale about freedom and spirit. A few scary parts for the very young and lacks some of the great humor found in many of today's animations but still a thoroughly enjoyable family film.
2,"Interminable, politically correct hogwash","Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh, but did Dreamworks really think that children would sit through an hour and a half of pretty pictures without anything close to a plot, or a single laugh, or one memorable song and not be bored out of their skulls?... Thank goodness for fast forward. And enough already with the skewed history lessons: every white man is [bad], every Indian is noble and gentle. Some of ""Spirit"" is gorgeously rendered, but on the whole it's inert and hopelessly dull."
4,"ASWILD AS THE WIND ,THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU SORE","DreamWorks newest animatted -is a hit for the young and old.follow the untamable spirit of a wild mustange in the old west.From his birth too his return too freedom this movie offers up a breath taking journy.The music & body language of the animals speak more then words,the back ground is a work of art.The storie is told with a horses point of veiw.Spirit's narrative is the only animal voice,he tells his own tale.From his birth -which will destin him too be leader &protector; of the herd. To his caputre bye U.S Miltary ,befreinding of a lacota worrior,falling in love with a mare name Rain,and Saving his land from the development of a rail road.in all i give this a 4.25 out of 5 stars."
5,Calvary Horse Capture by Brian K.,"A beautiful horse named Spirit can run free. But the calvary thinks it is so beautiful, so they chase it. But when Spirit trys to escape, Spirit gets captured. They give Spirit to an indian. Spirit learns to carry someone on it's back. Spirit becomes a mount & meets a horse named Rain. Spirit would never be broken."
5,Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron,Had the video which jammed in an old machine and replaced it with this DVD. It's something my daughter wants to keep and save for later years
5,A Must See And Own!,"Spirit-Stallion Of The Cimarron was excellent. I finally got to see a animated family film where the animals don't ""talk"". Matt Damon did a wonderful job narrating the film as Spirit himself. Brian Adams added excellence to the film with his rough gritty voice which added the western feeling. The facial expressions of the horses were fasinating and very cute. I would recommend this animated film to anyone! Even if you don't like animation, this movie will change your mind."
1,"junk like the french's...oh,wait,they don't have any...",I got this movie on DVD and now realize that it should have been spent on 'Bush Won!Hahaha!Liberals!'.This is such a traditionally liberal Hollywood new-age PC reverse-racist pile of pink dreck.What a stupid way to spend your time croboys when you could be thinking about the end of John Kerry forever.
3,Disappointing Follow-up,"After such great Animated DreamWorks films such as Antz, Shrek, The Prince of Egypt, and Eldorodo, DreamWorks Pictures brings out Spirit. A tale about a horse who lived during the old west and is narrated by Matt Damon. What I really don't like about this film is that the main character in this film, the horse, does not talk as in most cartoons about animals. So yes, this movie is more true to life by having the horses not talk, but then why is it that this story is told by a narrator who is supposed to be the horse Spirit. If not for the soundtrack, this movie would have been a total bomb. Brian Adams does a great job of telling the story through the lyrics in his songs. Where most movies just have music that may or may not have anything to do with what is going on in the film, you can actually listen to the music and not watch the movie and know what is going on. Save your money and wait for this one to come out on VIDEO."
1,Disgusting,"We rented this DVD a couple of months ago expecting a great movie (as we have enjoyed many other Dreamworks films.) However, this was really disappointing, and a disgusting, depressing, and even sappy flim.First, there's the thing with no talking except for the narration. You have to be a real horse lover to enjoy that. I myself don't speak ""horse.""And then there's the old ""poor little animals, big bad humans"" idea, which is just sickening. Don't get me wrong, I like animals. But this kind of tear-jerker animal rights kind of film is nauseating.Even worse, there's the ""Kind Smart Native Americans"" and the ""Bad Stupid White Men."" I mean, all throughout the movie, when the Indian boy got hurt, it was obviously meant to be a matter of concern. But when on the white men got hurt it was supposed to be funny.Overall, a terrible film, and definately not suitable for little children. It's basically just about a stallion who is a hero because he kills people and causes forest fires."
5,"Spirit, Stallion of the Cimarron",This movie is wonderful! I purchased it for my 19 month old grandson and he loves it! I believe I enjoyed watching it as much as I enjoyed sharing it with him!!! I would highly recommend it to any family that has children!! It is also some what educational about how the railroad was built!! I truly loved it and I have watched it numerous times and each time I notice something I missed previously!!
5,Great movie for all ages and great music!,"I first watched this movie with a friend's young son, Shawn, because it was his favorite movie. I'm over 60 and it was wonderful! Really kept you involved, we laughed, hung in suspense, cried together, finally had true joy at the end. And the music was wonderful, done by my favorite Bryan Adams. Highly recommend for anyone from young children to oldsters!"
5,Inspirational and Moving,"Narrated by Matt Damon, my entire family found this movie incredibly well-directed. The storyline is inspirational and emotional and is about a wild horse whose ""spirit could not be broken"" in spite of the endless attempts of the soldiers to ""break"" him into a disciplined horse fit for the army. IMHO this movie is a good portrayal of will power and determination. Although the movie is quite lengthy, it captured my 6-yr old's attention and has remained one of her all-time favorites. The soundtrack is also excellent and features songs performed by Bryan Adams."
5,A mature sort of childrens movie.,"This movie can be very mature,it's rather depressing actually.Spirit gets taken away from him family and friends in the wild,and is taken into horse training. He's very resistant to this,and thus is treated rather cruelly. He meets a boy who was captured,they escape,yadda yadda. Then,enter the love story.Don't expect any talking animals either,we only hear Spirit speak once or twice as the narrator.This movie is realistic,and it's a friendship story.I love it,and highly recommend it."
5,Excellent. Where is the Blu-ray?,"This is by far one of my favorite movies, in my humble opinion, one of the best movies ever made. Good action sequences and the music is simply outstanding. I have been looking for this movie in blu-ray format and I haven't found it. This movie should already been released in blu-ray. What seems to be the problem?"
5,This Horse ROCKS!,"When I saw this movie, I felt the freedom that these horses had in their time. We humans have ruined this world with our polution, and expansion. This movie shows us to take care of our wildlifs and our heritge should it be lost forever. I give this movie a 5 out of 5fr showing us our true path in life..."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"I absoultley love this movie! My mom, cousin, and I went to see it the Sunday after it came out, and I had a great time! I don't ever cry at movies, but I did at this movie! My cousin who was 8 and I was 9 (but I am 10 now) We loved it! Oh, and I thought it was going to be sorta lame cuz Spirit would talk like those other LAME movies, But he didn't!TWO THUMBS UP!"
4,Excellent Movie,"I took my four kids, ages 12,9,5,&3 to see this movie. To my suprise it was not another talking animated movie. We all enjoyed the movie very much. That is all the've talked about since we saw it, so much so that we now own almost every toy produced about Spirit & Rain, With the exception of a backpack that my youngest wants for her Birthday, that I am now on the hunt for. I recommend this movie for all ages."
3,good movie - frustrating process,"although we love the movie, the purchase was difficult. for whatever reason the purchase was logged as full screen even though i requested wide screen. amazon directed me to the seller to correct this & the seller directed me to amazon. it never got corrected & i got tired of the run around!!!"
1,G-rating????,"I brought my 3 year old grandson to see ""Spirit"" for his first movie theater experience. He loves animals and I picked this film based upon its G-rating. G-rated films, by definition , are to have minimal violence. While the film was beautifully produced, the violence was extreme. The stallion was brutalized at every turn. The attack on the Indian village was reminiscent of a Sam Peckinpah film. We had to leave before the end of the film and we were not the only filmgoers to leave early during the showing we attended.My problem is not with the film but with the rating. If this were not an animated film it easily would have been rated a PG. Should this make any difference? Shame on those whose job it is to rate these films."
1,Can I Sue? *OR* A Godawful Waste of Time,"If I could, I would sue the heck out of the studio for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. Could this poor horse possibly HAVE any more bad luck? We've got a wrenching ""Spirit taken from his Mommy"" scene. We've got the Evil White Men torturing the horse by denying it water in summer heat. We've got the horse crying and missing his family. We've got the Nice Indians being tormented. We've got the moment when you think Spirit's girlfriend-horse is killed. In addition to the excessive drama, we have fun for the adults, too! We've got Bryan Adams singing every three and a half seconds, which could make any adult cry. We've got awful PC revisionist history, which could make any adult feel ill. I would rather be poked in the eye with a hot sharp stick than watch this movie again. I need to sue the studio for the hour and a half of my life that I can never get back. Buy the Lion King instead. Trust me."
4,The African American Perspective,"Naturally, when I watched this movie, my view was totally different from other viewers. I identified with the horse and the Native American as someone whose ancestors were treated like the horse. I cried often during the movie and after I watched it the first time, the memory of that horse pulling the locomotive haunted me for days. I think the movie was well done technically. More importantly, it delivered a powerful message about our country's history."
2,Misleading Movie,"I took my daughter to see this movie at the theater. I thought the horses were going to talk, all they did was neigh & whinnie. You have to more or less figure out what the neighing & whinnineing is supposed to mean. It would've been a great movie if the horses would've had voices of their own."
4,Equine Freedom Fighter or Terrorist,"Let me set the stage for you. The indominable leader of the herd/clan sees his homeland and way of life threatened by the incursion of the American military. He leads an attack against the Americans in which he crashes their large transportation vehicle into a town causing a huge explosion and great destruction. Osama bin Laden? No, Spirit the horse!It makes you wonder what point the producers of this film are trying to make, and I salute them for their courage. It's an excellent object lesson in the dangers of military expansionism and why much of the world sees the US as arrogant colonialists. Overseas box office should be outstanding."
4,It is educational,"The movie is of course for children, it is also suitable for adult. The story is touching and can lead you to emotional journey."
2,"White man bad, everything else good...","Despite the great animation, I was disappointed that I took my three-year-old to see Spirit. I thought even the ""white man bad"" theme of political correctness had run its course in modern media, but I was wrong. I am still explaining to my son that I (a white man) am not bad and have never hurt horses.The movie was a little bland, with none of the originality and charm of Shrek. Perhaps Dreamworks had to offer Spirit to the Hollywood politically correct crowd as some sort of token of kinship. If you miss this movie, don't loose sleep."
5,"""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmaron"" is way better ""Shrek""","I thought Spirit had good humor, showing childern respect and but not least but last it was telling kids things not to do what. Spirit is one favorables of myn. I think Shrek is number 89 on my favorite movies. Thank you also to DREAMWORKS beautiful work in Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmaron."
3,A struggle for freedom...,"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a visually beautiful story about Spirit, a wild mustang, who gets caught by cowboys. The story is about Spirit's struggle for freedom and through his struggle he meets several different characters and learns the lesson of freedom. Throughout the story Spirit is mute, which provides a feeling of authenticity. However, this is what makes the film a little sluggish, since it balances on a thin line between serious and comedic where there is almost no dialogue. The film offers a good moral cinematic experience through Spirits adventure, but fails in keep the audience's attention due to lack of staying on track."
2,Batteries,"Battery life is not what I expected. If the camera is loaded and not used for 2 days, the batteries need to be recharged. I just don't understand why they don't last longer. They seem ok when the camera is in operation."
4,Long lasting!,I purchased these batteries because the current batteries that came with the camera would only last for 20 minutes. After using the Canon NB4-300 batteries which provided me with 6 hour of battery life. This was just what I needed when conducting my surveys and grabbing pictures of various construction site locations.
5,Satisfied customer,Product arrived fast and as described. I Would definitely do business with this seller again.
3,Meh.,"This film is not even a close 2nd to the Girl with the Dragon tattoo.....which was a great book and movie. Just trying to make money on sequels. OK, if you watch it free with streaming."
3,OK but action lacked,I saw them all and the first was the best. This one was least best but ok. Had a Hollywood ending. Needed more violent smackdown.
2,Ruined by an acting great,The trilogy is a great story with vast potential. I ruined the experience by first watching the 2011 version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo staring Rooney Mara. After seeing Rooney's world class performance as the star 'Lisbeth' these original videos are very lack luster. Until Rooney stars in a new adaptation of the last two movies you should stick with the book.
3,A Dull Shadow of The Original,"The first movie in this series was truly great, and the second was less impressive but still pretty good, whereas this third one descends further to the extent of being just OK. It does have some of the Swedish charm of the first two, but the plot seems lackluster and contrived by comparison, and Lisbeth's role is diminished almost to the point of being marginal. Unfortunately, this is a clear case of trying to capitalize on the success of a predecessor without doing the work necessary to maintain its standard."
1,Just too slow,"Tried to watch it while on my elliptical. Bored me to tears. The dub was tolerable, the story was just painfully slow."
4,Good Movie,Well made! It follows the book and the characters closely match what I envisioned while reading. The english dubbing didn't get in the way at all.
5,Gwkhn,Fantastic movie!! The trilogy is worth the money.This girl kicks butt. Good actress and Looking forward to the American version.
2,A Disappointment,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire were simply excellent. The acting, cinematography, and capture of the novels' essence were simply exquisite. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, on the other hand, left out too much of the latter to be enjoyable. Erika Berger's leaving for and harassment at SMP, the investigation by the Constitutional Protection Unit, and Mikael Blomkvist's affair with Monica Figuerola, were too much part of the story to be deleted. Perhaps a two-part movie was necessary. I hope the American film of this novel, if there is one, addresses this shortcoming."
3,Disappointing,"Read the books, saw the movies. The last book is as engrossing as the first 2 until the last 100 pages or so. The Hornets Nest does not follow the book, but was still disappointing after the first 2 installments were 4 star. I hope the American version sticks with the books until the end and then gives it the standard Hollywood ending. I could have done a much better job than SL in wrapping it up, IMHO"
3,Liked the books,"I liked the books better then the movie.I watched it, but would not watch it more thenthe one time."
4,Nice change from Hollywood,"Must see other 2 movies before this one, good movie1 First movie stands alone, but the trilogy really wraps up the whole story line."
4,Superb,"As with the previous two films in the trilogy the movie does not disappoint. Once again the acting is great, and the unexpected keeps you on the edge of your seat. Thoroughly recommended,however needs to be viewed in sequence to obtain the complete experience."
1,Region,"I recently purchased the DVD The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest, I live in Australia which uses the 'PAL' UK, Euro TV system, message comes up select your region code, I should have been sent the DVD that uses our system.What's more can't find any email address to communicate with Amazon."
4,Great Movie,"Without giving anything away, this is a great movie because it keeps the audience attention on the screen. People want to know how the main character/s will handle the drama that is unfolding."
3,Reasonably well acted and entertaining,"Screenplay took a lot of liberties with story. The end is very disappointing change. If you just watch the movies, you'll probably find it entertaining and enjoyable. If you read the novels, you may be frustrated."
5,An amazing conclusion.,"After being shot, beaten and nearly buried alive Lisbeth Salander is in the intensive care unit. She is also about to be tried for 3 counts of murder. Along with her friend Mikael, Lisbeth is trying to expose the corruption behind the sex slave trade, and prove her innocence in the process. Heads will role no matter the verdict, but it's nice to see the heroine win.I love all 3 movies in this trilogy. I think that this one and the first movie are the best. If you are reading my review you have probably seen the other 2 movies. I can definitely say with confidence that this movie does not disappoint. It's a fantastic conclusion to a soon to be classic movie trilogy."
3,Swedish-style judicial propaganda,"The major character demonstrates a strength and good physical form after speedy recovery from life-threatening wounds and takes an upper hand with a help of a brave journalist and his colleagues.Rather a happy-ended fairytale of Swedish-style judicial propaganda as a court dismissed state-arranged lasting lies, corruption and charlatanry a pedophile-psychologist impersonalized.A viewer felt movie-makers themselves were tired of this sequence politicized heavily."
4,Great fun,"as good as the book - I watched it in Swedish first with the subtitles, to get the flavor and then again in English voiceovers - both good. Very good casting."
3,Uneven and Slow -,"""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was somewhat disappointing in that the minutiae of the case gets boring. The two original leads have very little interaction. That is what spiked the chemistry in the previous two movies. Just too much revenge in this story - and much much talk. The story can't help dragging because of the complications from her father's murder and intricate details of the infiltration of spies at Sweden's highest level of government."
4,Excellent ending to the series,"This is the third part of the Swedish trilogy, and I think it winds up the story very well. It's too bad the author didn't live to continue the series as he had planned, because the book and movie have sort of an open ending, but this also can be seen as winding up a host of plot points. The American versions of this book and the previous one, The Girl Who Played With Fire, have not been made, but based on a comparison between the U.S. and Swedish versions of the first movie, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I think the Swedes got it right. I don't want to give away much of the plot, which is convoluted like the first two novels/movies, but suffice it to say that I found the conclusion very satisfactory. I highly recommend this whole series -- just know that you will have to watch it closely to read all the subtitles and keep up with the twisty plot."
3,Reasonably Entertaining,"If you're a ""Girl With the Dragon Tatoo"" fan, you'll wish there had been more to the story. While I enjoyed the movie, I thought a better job could have been done with the material available in the book. There was much more of the story that could have been included to give it a higher rating. Keep in mind that this is a foreign film, therefore being dubbed in English can be distracting."
3,Weakest of the triology,I liked the first two movies more. I had read all the books and this movie was still hard to follow; I wager it would be very frustrating to someone who had not read the books first. The books was quite complicated and convoluted. The screenplay was necessarily simplified...but perhaps not quite enough.
4,"Finally, some resolution--","We had enjoyed the two prior movies in the series, and were looking forward to this one. Would recommend it. Very complicated twists of plots and characters, but worth figuring out in the end. Watched each of the movies twice, once in English, once in original Swedish with subtitles. Both added to the flavor and understanding of the times and circumstances."
3,THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS NEST,"GREAT CONCLUSION TO A INCREDIBLE TRILOGY. THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS NEST WAS A ENGAGING COURTROOM DRAMA THAT REVEALED THE MYSTERIOUS, AND TRAGIC EVENTS OF LIZ LIFE, WHICH EVENTUALLY LEEDS TO HER ARREST, AND COURTROOM SHOW DOWN WITH THE MAN WHO ABUSED HER AS A CHILD.I DIDN'T HOWEVER LIKE THE VERY LAST SCENE, IT LEFT ME A BIT PERPLEXED, AND WONDERING...WHAT NOW? WITH LARSSON DEAD I GUESS WE WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO LIZ, THAT IS, UNLESS LARSSONS GIRLFRIEND OF OVER 20 YEARS, WHO CLAIMS TO HAD HELPED LARRSON WRITE THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, STEPS UP AND DECIDES TO CARRY ON HIS LEGACY, THEN THE TALE OF LIZ ENDS WITH THE HORNETS NEST."
2,Worst of the bunch,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was an addictive and suspenseful thriller. I enjoyed it a lot. The Girl Who Played with Fire was much more convoluted, much less tense, and kind of..melodrama-ish.And then this...this was just a bad movie.It feels like the last two movies should have been made into mini series rather than a 2 hour film because its clear they are disjointed and difficult to get emotionally involved in."
2,What's the point?,"Ain't gonna spend any money buying short version of any films released this way by majors when we know there's a long version. It's really a total disrespect for both the public and the film makers. Feel like buying a brand new car with missing wheels, period."
2,Larson Edited,"Boring, dark film version of the book.Only plus was they had to trim Larson's meandering, unedited style to fit it all on the screen in two hours.And yet, they missed the illogically seductive Larson style: the women aren't as gorgeous, the men aren't as charismatic as the book's (or vice versa).Maybe I lack the culture to appreciate it: maybe living in Sweden for a few years would sharpen my palate."
2,The boring sequel that would not end,"This sequel is very slow moving, and never seems to come to an end. No action to speak of, really, until the closing minutes. Most of it is a convoluted exposition of why this punk goth chick is so mad at the world. I got tired of her expressionless looks. And what's up with the 1980 Goth hair and outfits? Silly. Maybe that looks tough these days in Sweden. As usual, we have the more than normal coincidences here to help the plot along. If the third film in this series is any slower than this, it will be glacial. Needed a good haircut."
3,Weakest of the series. If you've seen other 2 this is a satisfying conclusion to trilogy. I say B.,"The final chapter in the ""Millenium Trilogy"" (Girl With The Dragon Tatoo series). After waking up in a hospital Lisbeth is nursed back to health...in order to stand trial for attempted murder. Mikael continues on his mission to prove her innocence. This one is also hard to review. If you haven't seen other two movies I would watch them first. If you have you know what you will get. The first half is slow moving, but picks up at the trial. Very satisfying conclusion to the series. Overall the weakest of the 3, with ""Dragon Tatoo"" being the best. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - Mabye (The American remake of ""Dragon Tatoo"" due in theaters this Dec., I may re-watch to compare if I don't remember these)"
2,Discouraging,"Like the previous two installments, ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" is flat, unimaginative and pedestrian- three things the novels never came close to being. It's discouraging to see that the Swedish film adaptations of such unique novels would translate so bluntly to the screen. While all the major plot points are there, this third and final part of the trilogy refuses to have the sizzle that the novel had. Granted, there is an enormous amount of exposition and while it was fascinating in the novel, the film consists of bunch of people sitting around and talking. There was plenty of opportunity to improve on the story and making it just as riveting as the novel (and this can be said for ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"") but unfortunately it never happens. The filmmakers were too concerned with such a literal adaptation of Stieg Larsson's words that they forgot all the possibilities the medium of film had to offer this incredible story."
1,English dubbed is HORRIBLE,This is an amazing movie. I cannot believe amazon decided to make the dubbed version free. The movie is horrible with voice overs. I hate to think amazon feels the typical viewer is too lazy to read subtitles.
1,poor quality and not a equipment issue,"After informing ""movies and game store"" of an issue of a blu-ray I purchased. I was told that this was a firmware issue and pretty much have to live with it. The new player firmware is up to date. The used Blu-Ray is either warn out or it's a poor copy. I will never purchase from this company again and will inform everyone I know to do the same. This store doesn't care about customersBut the movie is awesome one of my favorites...all the store had to do was replace it with another"
4,rebel with cause,"Having read the books and gotten a bit lost in trying to pronounce the Swedish place names it was nice to be able to listen [to the English dubbed sound track]. I am not sure I would have been able to follow the fine points had I not read the books first but the videos probably would stand on their own as good entertainment without the books. I enjoyed the videos, especially as a counter-point to the books."
4,TGWKTHN,"This episode was not as intense as the 1st and 2nd. Also there was significant departure from the book, particularly the lack of the relationship which developed between Bloomqvst and the woman detective. Perhaps my expectations were shaped by having read the whole series. In that light, I have to say it was a very entertaining film."
3,The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"My least favorite out of the trilogy. I was rather bored throughout the entirety of the movie and was really waiting for some action to liven it up. If you've already watched the first two, you might as well watch this one.... Otherwise skip it."
4,Don't Americanize This,"There's a rumor somewhere that America wants to customize this movie into an American version. To be honest with you, America is a disappointment when it comes to a good thriller like these folks have done. Keep it original. I enjoyed this as much as the Dragon Tatoo but havent seen the second one to make any comparison as others mentioned."
3,Fans of the books should love this cliff note movie version,"I place the novels as one of the best books I have ever read. But there is so much material that is left out of the films that I wonder if the movies form a cohesive narrative to the totally uninitiated? I did enjoy the DVDs but I think it was only as a refresher of the great books. In Hornets nest, that secondary investigation seemed to come out of no where in the DVD. The trial seemed way to short, I really missed Neicermier's back story and I missed all the office shenanigans at Millenniums office. Still, as I said before I liked the movie and it kept me involved, but still, I wonder."
3,distracting,Dubbing throws off the rhythm of the visual images as well as the emotional tone & continuity. it is just flat. I more enjoyed the sub-text.
3,dubbed version only,"We watched the first two episodes in Swedish with English subtitles last year. When we finally got a chance to watch the third episode, only the English dubbed version was available. The dialogue in English lacks the subtle emotional tension that comes across in the original Swedish. The dubbed dialogue is way too stoic and detracts from the climatic buildup of the film.Amazon.com, please return the original Swedish versions to your library."
3,"Tattoo = 5, Fire = 2, Nest = 3","Have now watched all 3 ""The Girl..."" movies. Did not read any of the books. The ""Dragon Tattoo"" was my favorite of the 3 and then this one next. This one....it was ok but like the second, limited viewer engagement in the plot, story. We are told rather than allowed to extract for ourselves. I did enjoy the series overall, although I could have used some more changes in ""The Girl..."". Through it all, she seemed to change very little and not sure I believe anyone could go through all she did not not change some or more than presented. I like ""The Girl.."" but found her behavior getting old as I watched this one. What was unique about her and interesting began to become annoying in this one. SO, over all???? Recommend ""Dragon Tattoo"". Do not recommend ""Fire"" and this one??? Take or leave it."
5,A necessary disturbance,"These are not the types of Movies I normally watch - however sometimes a dose of drama, reality, and tough life are good for those of us who are unaware of this kind of suffering. I told my adult children they should watch it. I came to appreciate the great strength and struggles of Lisbet. It is important to know there are women who suffer this kind of abuse - some not so terribly violent - but still disturbing. Loved how she ""kicked butt"" in this finale."
4,Excellent wrap-up,"I've thoroughly enjoyed reading the trilogy and thought the first 2 adaptations into movies were great. This one is just as good. In the third book, there was A LOT of detail on the secret society and its players. Some people really like that, but I thought it dragged the story and the action did not pick up until about 70% into the book. This movie, thank goodness, deftly left out those details without getting us lost. I also appreciated that they left out the majority of Erika Berger's story. In doing this, the movie moved at an excellent pace.I've said it in my other reviews of the first two movies, but I cannot emphasize enough about Noomi Rapace's depiction of Salander. She makes the films!!"
1,Whitd Gold Earrings,"I was not happy with the earrings because the backs were too loose and the first time I wore them I lost one. Now, I have one earring. I was, however, fortunate enough to wear them half a day."
5,It works.,It works I guess. Soon after getting it I stopped using Co2 and started using HPA.I thought I would have a problem but it works fine with both HPA and CO2.
1,"Great price, but...","Been using this for years and I can definitely tell that this stuff does not look or feel like the stuff you get at the Shiseido counters in department stores. Is there such thing as knock off make-up? If so, I think this might be... the packaging (Shiseido box) that it came in looked really old and worn out. The case itself also looks generic and not the same as the Shiseido counters."
1,shiseido the makeup,these powdery has not the box in what it is put on the photo and it is not such good color.
5,Five stars won't cover it,"I can't believe this book is no longer available. It's a gorgeous book from front to back, full of the best American poetry has to offer. Get it any way you can."
5,Works great on LED tvs,Wanted a long cable this work just fine on my new Samsung LED 55 in tv. The build quality is good
4,Very good! If you like pop-classics and good guitar,"I have a number of Steven Pasero recordings. This recording and his Nutcracker Suite recordings are in my opinion his best. If you like good classical guitar you'll enjoy this recording. His later recording labeled ""Pasero"" in which he tried to branch out, adding voices and additional instrumentation was pretty much odd-ball elevator music. However, I really enjoy and often listen to ""Guitar Heartsongs""."
1,I might call it Kimchee flavored...,"but it is not KIMCHEE soup. I see a lot of enthusiasm in reviews for this because it is vegan/cheap/not spicy but I think most of those reviewers have limited experience with Kimchee soup; there are a variety of recipes from all over the peninsula that might have meat or fish, and rice or ramen or, as traditionally, vegetables only but it ALWAYS has loads of kimchee in the soup. Think of a cabbage soup for comparison if you are not familiar with the context. This misses the mark on that issue so I'll get the udon version and add Sriracha paste for the heat and dress it to taste, or get the $.88 pack of Ramen and add my own Kimchee from Amazon.Kimchi - Authentic Korean Pickled Cabbage - Fresh (1 LB)"
4,Very good quality quick-soup!,"I have found Annie Chun's soups to look & taste pretty much the way it is shown in the picture. The Kimchi noodle bowl is spicy, colorful, and tasty when compared to many other instant soup choices on the store shelf. It will warm you up if you prepare it according to the easy instructions! I also like to add some veggies and cooked meat to make it a meal. This could be rated as 5-stars if it had a little more veggies, in my opinion. I would recommend adding some chopped cabbage family greens & a bit of shredded carrots for color & crunch! BTW, I observed several cases of Annie Chun's soups going into a good asian restaurant in Manhattan mid-town, NYC! This stuff is really good and makes a great starter!"
4,Fresh and chearper than any store!,"Product arrived quickly and even with shipping was lower priced than compared with any grocery store in our area including the Military Commissary! The soup is a great spicy warm up. For those of you not familiar with Kimchee, it's a pickled, spicy cabbage. My wife never liked Kimchee in any other form, but really enjoys this all natural, no MSG soup."
4,Good product,I love Annie Chun's Udon noodle bowl and this product is almost as good. Same noodles but different seasoning. I can completely control the heat with the Udon noodle bowl. This one is somewhat spicy and to make it hotter didn't quite mesh well taste wise but I've only tried that a few times. Still it was quite good. I'd but it again.
1,Noodles,It would have been better if the noodles were thinner. It tasted like clay. I like the soup part. Hmm.
1,Not good.,This is the worst of the annie chun's product I have tried. I'm not sure how this is suppose to be korean and it tastes terrible. gives bad name to korean food everywhere.
5,"Annie Chun, you've outdone yourself.","I found this product once in a local grocery store and had to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! This soup is delicious, and I can pronounce all of the ingredients. Sadly, I've haven't been able to find the Kimchi Soup flavor locally again, but ordering the 6-pack was truly worth it."
5,It's unreal how good the Kimchi soup is!,"I've tried several of the Annie Chun flavors, and I liked most of them, but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious! This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried, and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products. This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long!It is moderately spicy, but if you don't mind a bit if spice, this one is just too good to pass up. I could practically live off of this stuff!Thank you, Annie Chun, for making a packaged meal worth eating!"
3,Just OK,"Being Korean, I thought I'd try these kimchi bowls in lieu of the traditional ramen's that are loaded w/ preservatives and MSG. These bowls were just OK. They taste more like gochujang (red hot chili paste) more than kimchi, though. It was pretty spicy for me... couldn't finish the broth, but others I shared w/ were fine w/ the spice level.I may buy these again only as back-up if there's nothing to eat, not b/c it's something that's delicious."
4,Useful condensed reference,"Though hardly a place to learn the .NET framework, I found this little book a very useful reference to keep by my computer. (Of course I also have the great books by Liberty (""Programming C#"") and Troelsen (""C# and the .NET Platform) next to my computer as well and they should both definitely be purchased before this book.)"
2,Needlessly hard to read. Not much there.,"I'm not a big fan of this book. It's INCREDIBLY hard to read and it really doesn't cover all that much. I read it and then thought, ""well, this was pretty pointless.""Have you ever been in a project meeting and there's one developer in there who's read about 20 different super-obscure specs but doesn't really understand anything about any of them... then proceeds to spew volumes of impressive sounding but totally useless information that just confuses [...] everyone else?Well, if you turned that guy into a book, you'd get "".Net Framework Essentials.""I'd say pass on this book because it can't figure out if it wants to be a 10000 meter overview of .net or a 1 centimeter exploration of a few useless details."
3,"good background, but unfocused","I consider myself a die-hard O'Reilly fan when it comes to programming books. This book does 2 major things in my opion. First, it gives a pretty in depth description of the .NET platform itself, including a some of the thought behind design descisions made. This spans the first 4 chapters or so, and in my opion, is done in true O'Reilly fashion -- very nicely!The remainder of the book is a whirlwind run through many specific .NET technologies. Here I have to agree with other reviewers in that I spent more time cross-referencing MSDN than I actually did reading the book.Again, the discussion of the platform itself is really great. However, past that, if you're serious about learning the nuts and bolts of asp for instance, you'll need to get more focused book dealing with just asp."
2,skimpy,"This book is just a very skimpy and cursory review of .NET concepts. It dwells on those topics which already have full chapters devoted to them in other books. Like many .NET books on the market today, it is just a poor attempt at being first. You will probably look it over a few times and bring it back to the store for a full refund."
3,"Good, but others are better","This Progressive Onion Chopper does a good job, but you still need to slice the onion before you put it in the chopper. It won't chop through half of an onion like it claims. I wish I had bought the Vidalia Onion Wizard because it comes with 2 inserts (one for chopping and one for dicing). I haven't been able to find another insert for the Progressive that is a different size."
2,Hercules I am not!!,"I used to think I was a strong woman. You need to be stronger than Hercules to use this thing. The only thing it does is ""cut down"" the crying from the onions. I think it might even take longer."
2,"Sorry, but not worth it","This is the first time I am going to leave such a negative review because it just doesn't work as advertised.First of all, the grid doesn't work as a blade or at least sharp enough when used to chopped the halved onions. To push it harder might also crush the entire mechanism.I also read some other people's very helpful reviews, but a good kitchen gadget shouldn't have to take a ""special skill"" to press, push, and press, push over and over to cut something like onions. To me, what's the point?I have used some very magical and awesome kitchen tools. This is definitely not one of them.I don't recommend anyone to purchase this. Sorry."
3,Does the job but a little tricky to use.,"Dices onions and potatoes perfectly but you can't put a whole half onion in it(unless it's a small one). It becomes too hard to push down and feels like you could snap in in half. So if I'm doing a large onion I just take off some of the outer layers and do them separately. Also wash it straight away because if you let the onion dry on it, it becomes quite a pain to clean."
1,Worked great ... ONCE ... then broke,"The second time I used this the clear bottom broke near the foot, apparently from the pressure. It was with a small onion. THis is a badly engineered product and a bit exensive for chopping only two onions during the life of the product."
2,Worked great--for a month,"Unlike other choppers, which produce either huge chunks or onion juice, this chopper makes beautifully diced pieces--about 1/4 squares. Lovely! And with far fewer tears than a knife and cutting board dicing process usually produces.It takes a lot of effort to operate--you have to have fairly strong arm muscles to force the onion halves through the grid.To my dismay, mine broke today, after only a month of use (I used it probably 3-4 times per week, I'd guess). I'm planning to exchange it, since the end product was so marvelous. If that one lasts for more than a month, I'll update this review. If it doesn't, it's back to the cutting board for me."
3,disappointed,When I have purchased this item before I always received the blades for two different sizes. This time I only received one size of blades. I am very disappointed!
1,Breaks Easily,"stay away. The construction of this item is very poor. While it looks appealing, it broke after first use in my case. I kept half an onion on the blades and applied uniform pressure on the top only to find the fixed edge breaking off and the onion stuck in the blades."
3,Works Great but Need Muscles,"It works good. You really have to put your back into it. Problem is, we ordered 2. One was perfect, the other cracked at the corner. So our friend loved hers, but we can't use ours. Should have been packaged better."
1,Horrible product!,"This product was a waste a money. It doesn't work on onions at all...even if it does a bit, all the onions get stuck. It is terrible.Don't buy it."
1,Not Satisfied,"I am sorry to say that, I am not satisfied with this onion chopper. I need to cut the onions into very thin slices before I put them on the onion chopper and it requires a heavy muscle pressure. So I have stopped using it and looking for something what will really work."
1,1/2 a star,This product works well as long as it lasts. This is my second try with this product and despite delicate handling and cutting the onion in small pieces before dicing this is the second time it broke at the hinge.I am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it .
3,Onion Chopper,It is all right but hard to push the onion through if you have any problems with your hands. I do try to use it though.
1,3 onions is all it took to break this one..! Low Quality...!!!,"Being a student, and living with three other guys, we were in dire need of some help around the kitchen when it came to cutting onions. The teary eyes were just not worth our time anymore. So we started search for a chopper that would help us mere mortals out. Frankly speaking, after reading all the reviews, I was a little sceptical of buying the product in the first place, but went ahead with it given that Progressive usually has good stuff. But was I wrong or what..! It took exactly 3 onions for the thing to break from the corner. The glass container just chipped off from where it is connected to the top part. No way can i mend it or use it at all now. I am really really disappointed with the product, and would not buy any other product from Progressive anymore. The worst way I have ever spent 16$. :(Disappointed, to say the least. Please stay away from this product."
2,cheapy made.,I bought to of them 6-8 months ago and had one. In one canning season I broke all three and all I can is salsa.I wish they made one of these out of metal because when the work they work great.they break in the same place every time right buy the left side hinge
1,Misrepresentation,"This item is such a let down. The feature presented on it's TV commercial is so far from its actual capability. To me, it's actually close to useless. It really doesn't even deserve 1 star, but that's as low an option as I've got."
1,Lousy...Don't buy it!,What a waste of money! I'm not strong enough to bare down on this thing. Then I even pinched my finger in the process... Do not recommmend unless you got the Hulk doing it for you...
4,The Chopper,"This is a great Product which I find useful and easy to cut Onions, peppers, carrots, tomatoes and anything you want cut in to tiny pieces"
4,Good chopper but don't force the tough outer layer of onion,"This chopper will rapidly chop onion and I've also used it for peppers. It's a real time saver - and no tears (though I've never teared up when cutting onions by hand either). This is the second chopper I've owned - the first one self destructed when I tried to chop too large a piece of onion that still had it's tough outer layer attached. The upper lid bent the chopper mesh and that was the end of that! Tip for use - cut the onion into chunks and remove the tough outer layer. If you have to use a lot of pressure to force the vegetable through the blade, you're pressing too hard."
5,I love this chopper.,"I love this chopper. If you have ever seen or heard of the Vidalia Onion Chopper, this is IDENTICAL to it. I have that one too and it just finally broke to pieces. This one is a bit cheaper than the Vidalia one so I thought I'd get it and it works fine. The secret is to be sure and cut the onion pieces into small enough wedges to not put too much bind on it. That is why my first one broke. I just used too big of sections of onion and it couldn't handle them without breaking."
3,Okay...,You need to figure out th knack of using this.... Especially for onions when using the smaller blade... Took me a While though.... Had got it mainly for chopping onions and was frustrated when my onions used o get stuck mid way V matter how hard I tried they would not budge.... But then I figured that king 4 pieces if any onion. Big or small does the trick.... I now use this regularly and am quite happy... One more tip is it works better when u place it at a plane that is below your hip.... Easier to apply pressure....
2,Not that great,"Could never get it to slice through an onion by myself, had to get my boyfriend to add a little more muscle to it. And then the thing broke after a few months. I wouldn't ever buy this product again. And its ashame too I had high hopes for it."
4,Onion Chopper,"This looks exactly like Vidalla that broke on me, but this was a lot less money. I can also use a second sizedicer blade from the Vidalla in the onion chopper. Not sure why it is called an onion chopper because you can use it for other vegatables also. You do have to be careful by cutting vegetables to a medium size and holding your hand where it attachs, but overall I love it."
3,Can not use pressure,The device is cool when you try to cut something with less pressure applied. It can not dice a whole or a 1/2 or even a 1/4 onion. It will dice thru 3-4 slides of an onion. Don't expect this to be a marvel. It's basic.
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I have only used it once and it broke! It for sure is a ""one time use only"" and the way it is shown on TV is not the way you really use it, not so smoothly - I think they have used an already chopped onion. I would say it is better for soft vegetables such as tomatoes (which also is very messy because of the juice). It was just a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,"Old too soon, smart too late","The negative reviews of this product are all too true. I can make it work by cutting only a quarter of a small onion at a time, and the tiny pieces created are terrific, but the effort required is considerable, and the saving in time is negligible. Some of the complaints I haven't encountered. I put it in my dishwasher with no bad effect. Still, it was pretty cheap, so what can one expect?"
1,"Not worth the time, money or effort","Bought this item and returned it.1. This chopper has only one blade....which chops everything into very TINY pieces.2. Hard to clean between blades and top grids.3. While it is ""easy"" to use, you have to cut your onion in half and force the top down to chop.4. After a couple of uses, it breaks."
3,Durability,"It chops the veggies extremely well, but the snap-on for attaching the top is not very durable. Mine broke after a few uses."
1,Onion Chopper,"The first time that we used this onion chopper, the blades popped out and bent. The chopper had to be sent back!"
1,I wouldnt buy it,I think it dosent work.... It dosent cut onion....takes a lot of pressure to slice it...and even then slips....and very difficult to clean afterwards....
4,Good device if not perfect,"I've been using one of these regularly for a couple of years now, it works well as long as you don't try to cut too much at once. The blurb says you can put half an onion in but I find a quarter works much better, as a 220lb man I have no problem generating the force needed for half but the device feels too flimsy for that. Mine didn't have the lid cleaner, or I've lost it, and cleaning the lid is a pain."
3,"Works well, BUT the plastic hinge breaks easily","This is an ingenious device that works pretty well if you are careful with it.To use this to chop up half of a medium-sized onion you need to apply a LOT of pressure to the lid of the device - basically you have to stand on it. This approach works quite well, until the delicate plastic hinge connecting the lid to the body of the device BREAKS. I've had two of these choppers, and neither has lasted for more than 20 onions. I suppose you could cut your onions into small pieces before feeding them into the device, but that would be somewhat time-consuming.So I'm going to try another kind of onion chopper instead of getting another one of these."
1,Snapped apart after just a few uses,Used this to chop just a few onions and one of the hinges that hold the top on snapped. It obviously isn't built to handle the mechanical force required to cut through crisp vegetables. Piece of plastic junk.
4,very useful thing,"it is the second one I am buying. It is great for cutting vegetables, but not very strong for the onions (that is why 4 on the rating). But for the price of $15 it is a wonder! Recommend!"
3,Useful but not durable,"This is a very useful product, BUT - it is not very durable. Various parts break. At any time I have had a left over bottom or top."
4,I dont cry anymore when chopping onions,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that you have to quarter the onion to get the product to pop and chop onions properly. I havent really used this on any other veges, but with quartered up onions this product works great!!"
3,good kitchen helper,"Nice tool to make quick, uniform onion pieces. A liitle hard to push the top down to make slices for fear of breaking plastic. Seems fine, but have only used it twice."
2,"essentially a good idea, but...","it requires quite a lot of struggle for the onions to be pushed through the metal grid. i almost have to lie down on this thing to get the onions through, and every time i do, i expect the device to break any second. often the outer onion layers just flatten out against the grid and - no matter how much force i apply - stay there. on the plus side, the chopper disassembles and cleans easily. all in all - did not really make my life a whole lot easier."
1,bloody finger,"watch your fingers while cutting with this very dangeres product,the worst product i ever bought.there is other onion cutters on the market what works excelent"
1,Do not buy this junk,I finally got to use this chopper. The second onion and the side broke the size of a peacon. Not the post but huge piece along the side with the post attached. Really not a good item. I leave a single star because the insist on some thing to leave the post.
1,Broke in 2 weeks,"This is the same as the ""Vidalia Chop Wizard""As many others have stated, the hinges are a weakness with this item. Mine broke within 2 weeks, while chopping quartered onions.My wife tried to contact the manufacturer for a replacement (we got this as a gift), but their website offers no details about returns/replacements, warranty, etc."
2,Had to return; did not work,My sister-in-law wanted one of these for some time. She cooks a lot and wanted to find something that would chop onions safely. She was thrilled to receive it but had to return it because she said it just did not chop onions properly.
5,Chopper,Great product don't know how I spent so many years without one not only good on onions buy great on shopping mushrooms
4,Good product,This is a good product. I wish the blades were a little wider. It does dice well. A little hard to clean
4,Onion chopper second time around,"I like your onion chopper very much, but this is my second one. I was chopping onions in the first one and the white plastic nob on the bottom part of the chopper broke off. That's why I had to buy a new one. If this one breaks I'll give you a one star rating."
4,replacing a good gadget,"I like this food chopper and am purchasing a replacement. The first lasted a year before being dropped. The plastic on the side of the top lid shattered so that the lid no longer works. Sure - it would be great if the plastic was a bit more resilient, but overall a very good product."
1,"Broke after 3-4 uses, big disapointment","I had high hopes for this product as my eyes water whenever I cut onions and this seemed like a fast and easy way to cut one. Unfortunately, the plastic cracked after the 3rd or 4th time I used it, despite cutting the onion into quarters before putting it in the chopper. Big disapointment."
1,only onions,"I was not aware that it ONLY did onions, it doesnt chop anything else very well. That was a disappointment"
2,"Great concept, aweful construction","I've used this chopper for almost a year and it has been slowly falling apart. First, it was one of the arms that held the pusher to the metal broke off when trying to disassemble for cleaning.Second, the metal grate bent on the edge, catching the pushing plastic part and cutting it. I had to put about 200lb of weight into it to cut an onion after a while.Then, I had to forcefully hit the top to get it to actually chop. As a result, the bottom piece cracked and its almost impossible to use. I still use it but have to hold it together until I find a more durable version of the chopper.Find a more expensive model that won't fall apart."
1,does not chop onion as was shown in ad,I did not like this product because you have to use a lot of pressure to chop a half of onion. It takes some time to do it.
1,You should not get it even if it were FREE,"It is too hard to use...only if your onions are really really tender and soft, it may work....too hard to use it...If you don't believe me you might as well try and return it like me paying the return shipping..."
4,good for avoiding cut fingers,"This device helps keep fingers out of the way of slippery knife blades, which, after a recent trip to the emergency room is why we purchased it. I have only had occasion to use if a few times since purchase, so I may still update this, but so far it does what it claims it will. Sometimes it can be a little hard to press down, depending, usually, on the size of the onion, and you may find it works best if you peel an extra layer of onion away to get to the softer parts. You also still need to cut the onion in half before putting it into this, which doesn't entirely do away with the chopped fingers risk. And it can be a little fiddly to clean. The container that catches the chopped onions is a real plus, and the extent to which this device reduces onion tears makes it well worth while, even if you're a very careful chopper."
4,great concept but can be better,"This is a great product if you cut lot of vegetables, especially onions. You can cut them with a snap of a motion. It is a snap if you know the technique. Use your palms to press this down with one palm on the top of each other.However, you need to cut the vegetables into small pieces to cover approximately half the surface of the blade. If you try to cut a bigger piece, the product will break at the hinge. I bought three in the past and all of them broke and I this is the 4th one that I am buying. Why I am still buying if they break? It makes my job of cutting onions and vegetables easy and they all are the same size. If you are making salsa, or salad where you care how the pieces look, this product is great. I tried slap chop and other products but don't like any of them. I wish they make this product with something other than plastic that wouldn't break or they can sell just the bottom container."
4,Chop those onions quick and easy!,"I purchased this little gadget in the store for myself... makes chopping onions a breeze and you don't ""cry"" as much! Wanted to share it with my friends and could not find it in the store. Was happy to find it on your site. Only reason I didn't assign 5 stars is that you DO have to clean it. Even that task is simplified with the handy little cleaning tool. I have a small electric food chopper and use it frequently, but I prefer this if I'm only chopping onions. I will chop several onions at a time and throw them in the freezer... ready for soups, burgers, whatever I want to season and cook with onions, which is just about everything! Nice, handy product. Get one!"
3,Needs hefty muscle -or foot action,I'm in the market for another onion chopper. I just broke my second one of these. I loved my first one as soon as I figured out I could put it on the floor and step on the rounded end to chop half an onion. Then my husband broke it doing the same thing. I promptly bought another one and stepped on the wrong end and broke that one too. I found it makes perfectly minced (not diced) onions but only for those who can press it closed. Took too much effort.
2,Good if you are careful,"It cuts the pieces small and evenly. Keep in mind that you are cutting up a quarter or half an onion in one push, so it takes a bit of effort. In addition to the paper thin layers of the onion you normally peel, you might want to take a couple more to make it easier to cut.If you are not careful, the base will break. Each of the two that I bought lasted several months for me, but I have given up on this one an am using a small food processor instead."
5,I love my onion chopper,"I bought my Progressive onion chopper a couple of years ago, I love it. I use it for onions, pickles, celery, bell peppers, boiled eggs. Have had no problems with it. I cut my onions in half and then cut each half in half, works just fine. Pickles and celery I cut in half. Read some reviews about being hard to push down, and on some points I have run into this, but not very often. The only thing I do not like about it is the little tool that comes with it for cleaning. The tool could stronger, the little ""forks"" bend too easy. I am getting ready to buy another one for my daughter, who tells me every time she visits how she wants one too."
1,Worked great ... ONCE ... then broke,"The second time I used mine the bottom part broke by the feet. The clear plastic shattered. It was with a small onion. A great idea, but a bit expensive for chopping only 2 onions."
3,Broke after three uses,"It's a good idea but maybe I got one that was shoddily assembled. While chopping an onion, the green plate kept getting shoved into the bottom section, and finally, the metal got pushed loose from its moorings in the plastic."
1,Its a Rip off!,"I wanted to have an onion cutter that would make my life easier. after buying this i found that it was tough to use. I had to apply all my body weight to cut onion. 2nd day , it broke.It wouldn't cut even small pieces of white onion when they are little slimy.It wouldn't cut tomatoes or bell paper , as written in one of the reviewsDon't waste your money."
1,OMG it SUCKS!,"I saw the video at Bed, Bath and Beyond and was excited because this item was supposed to be able to chop a tomato and any other fruit or veggie...To chop an onion using the Onion Chopper I had to use extreme force - But it worked. The tomato is another story. The Onion Chopper smashed a firm tomato paper thin excreting only the juice of the tomato. YUCK! Don't buy it!"
1,Piece of junk,"I don't understand how some of them gave a rating of 5.Mine broke on the very first day of use.Probably, it would work fine with butter or baked potatoes but definitely not with onions."
3,NUTS!,I really liked the chopper for use on various fruits and vegetables. Then I tried doing Brazil nuts. Trashed the dicing blade. The maker claims it will chop nuts. I say NUTS! Fortunately there is a place where you can order replacement parts reasonably.
3,Hard to clean,I find it hard to clean the blade area. I don't have a dishwasher so I let it soak then scrub it with a green pad. It looks clean until it dries then I see little food parts.Also the white fork tool broke so I use a butter knife to clean the lid. Other then cleaning it really works great.
2,Not a good idea to invest in,"Progressive International Onion ChopperAfter using for two times-this was a gift to my girlfriend. Because she does all the cooking and she liked it until one side broke, so she continued to use, then that side broke. Now looking at the return date which has passed and the item price. I would cost me more to replace than to return for half the price. What a rip off. Not happy with that outcome. Read comments before purchasing."
2,Chopper,"It is an Onion Chopper - - period! Watch if you try other things, it will break easily. For onions - - just great!"
2,Broke on the second onion.,"Did a great job for the first onion (sliced in halves), the hinge at the back broke off with the second onion.If you do buy this, perhaps quarter the onions to make it work better."
3,Dissappointed,Had previously purchased one from shopping channel and it included 2 different sized blades. this one only had one blade and it was the one that I would use the least so have returned it
3,Perfect Dices BUT watery and involve a struggle...,"Okay one you manage to push the onions using all your strength the dices are perfect cubes but watery. And the skin often gets stuck in the blade (use the comb to oush it through - in fact impossible to clean this thing without the comb). The V slicer is better. But this is less teary - saves your ears, tries your hands though!"
5,Progressive Onion Chopper,"This is the best thing that I own in my kitchen. No more teary eyes, and it is much faster."
4,very good dicer,I saw the product on a TV informercial for 20.00+ S&H (30.00)..Found it here... works great on onions and similar products... not for softer density items
1,Flimsy base,"This is the same product that was advertised on TV as the Vidalia Chop Wizard. While it worked it was great, but the plastic base is so flimsy it broke after 5-6 uses. Don't waste your money."
3,"It worked fine, but broke after few use.","It worked fine, but broke after few use. The blades are good, but I cant use it because it broke at the corner where the top lid fits."
2,"Chop, Chop Chop!","As previously mentioned, the dice blade is too small which requires more force than I am comfortable exerting on the plastic hinge parts.I thought I would get the large cutting blade inside the pack but no.I am shopping for a Vidalia chopper, I know it has both blades and I can go around the house experimenting to see what the old one can chop up (destroy)"
1,not as good as the Rada Serrated Food Chopper,I would recommend the Rada Aluminum Serrated Hand Food Chopper AWESOME!I love my serrated chopper by Rada Mfg. I would recommend that one instead of this one.I rec'd one of these over the holidays but like the serrated rada chopper the best.
4,Onion Chopper,"I found the onion chopper to be very helpful for food preparation. It speeds up the preparation of onions for use in all foods using chopped onions. In addition, it is easily cleaned by putting it in the dish washer. As a bonus, it can be used to chop a number of other vegetables and a number of fruits."
1,Onion Chopper,"this only comes with one cutting blade and it's the one for garlic etc, can't do onions .."
2,Chopper is Fragile,"The onion chopper is fragile. It worked for 10 days and then it broke. The blades broke and also the plate containing the blade broke. More pressure needs to be applied to cut the onion, but product is not designed to handle the pressure."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I have only used it once and it broke (made out of cheap plastic)! It for sure is a ""one time use only"" and the way it is shown on TV is not the way you really use it, not so smoothly - I think they have used an already chopped onion. I would say it is better for soft vegetables such as tomatoes (which also is very messy because of the juice). It was just a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,"I've owned 2, both broke, but...","I've purchased two of this onion slicer from Amazon. The first one broke after about a year, but I couldn't find any alternatives. I bought another one, and that one least about a year and a half.Now it's time to buy a new onion dicer since the last one broke. I'm going to try a different brand, but there aren't many options out there.I still give this 4 stars because it gets the job done. Just realize it has a limited useful life."
1,Useless for onions!,"I purchased this item because I had borrowed a similar VEGETABLE chopper from my daughter and liked it. I only used it to chop onions so figured I would buy the onion chopper.The grid on this chopper is smaller than the grid on the vegetable chopper, and the ONLY WAY to chop onions is to slice them thinly.It's great at chopping garlic - so for that, I'll give it one star.Don't buy this item to chop onions, it's impossible to push them through the grid!"
2,Not sturdy enough for the pressure required to chop an onion,"I chopped my first onion - had to slice it into about 6 sections to get it to work in this chopper. After my wrist started hurting from having to press so dang hard on it I recruited my husband to finish the job. He chopped one section, then upon trying to open it somehow broke off one hinge piece and shattered the clear plastic base. Definitely was an element of user error there, but this item just doesn't seem quite high quality enough to bear the immense pressure required to actually chop the onions through the very small blade grill. Disappointed."
4,"It's nice, but wears out quickly","Pros:- It's quick. One push and everything is chopped, versus some other products where you have to push multiples times and chop-chop-chop, etc.- Inexpensive. We've paid between $15-$20 each time we've purchased one.- You can turn the chopper on its side and see how much you've chopped. Very nice.Cons:- I'm on my 3rd Progressive onion chopper in 5 years. The pattern usually is the blade begins to dull over time, requiring more force to chop through the onion. Eventually the plastic hinges on the unit break under the increased stress.- It can be a little tricky to clean. They provide a cleaning tool which helps a lot, but you still have to pick onion skins from the blades by hand.- It's really just for onions, versus some other products that will chop a variety of things. Not really a con, but just a fact."
2,!!DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!,"Do yourself a favor and learn from my own personal experience with this product and choose a more expensive all-metal version - if you can find one. This inadequate plastic gizmo is just structurally incapable of functioning as intended. Forget about trying to dice a whole onion, as this pathetic gadget can't even do a proper job on half an onion. Its hard plastic construction feels as through it's going to break when you attempt to apply the amount of pressure necessary to force the onion through the metal dicing insert. The bottom line is that that even though this hard plastic gizmo seems to be well constructed, the fact is that it most definitely is NOT capable of dicing an onion in one smooth action"
2,Hard to clean!,The time I saved in chopping was wasted in the endless amount of time I had to spend tediously cleaning each little hole of the dicer. I took it back after only a couple of uses!
3,Amazon's Progressive Onion Chopper,"The Onion Chopper, reasonably priced from Amazon works wonders! We have used it for the vegetables, besides onions, like green, red, and yellow peppers put into the Salsa we make each year, It chops well, but you must make sure vegetables are pre-cut, so as not to force too much pressure, and break the lid. It really saves time, and I would recommend it for choppedvegetables used in canning. Freeze your freshly fine chopped onions, and vegetables for use in future recipes."
4,Interesting little product - definitely has made my onion chopping fun,"Now, I use a lot of onions in my cooking regularly - and its the least favorite chore to chop them up finely. so i thought i would try this little thing out and initially i was really disappointed cos it required quite an effort to press it and get it to work and then out of frustration, I just started STAMPING the onion chopper to press it - and it works PERFECTLY!!! Kudos to Progressive for making such excellent grade plastic i have to say - very clean, and very sturdy and with the whole stamping thing now, chopping onions is actually FUN! i chop a whole bunch at a time and store em for later use. My husband finds it hilarious to see me stamping to chop an onion, but hey - whatever gets the job done efficiently right!"
1,"Stay away from this cheap ""safe""","After about two years of being protected in the confines of our closet from weathering the plastic locking mechanism froze inside the safe. I had to input the combination a multitude of times and literally beat the safe with a rubber hammer to get the lock mechanism to disengage, which it did after about ten to twenty minutes of ""persuasion"". I took the mechanism apart sprayed it with silicone, placed it back together, and put a baking soda pack inside there to absorb moisture and guess what, six months later, surprise surprise, I had to do the exact same thing. That safe it not safe and DO NOT buy this. For you own sanity, stay away from Sentry.If I could put a negative star rating I would."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I'm giving this safe 5 stars because it fit my needs perfectly, especially for the price. The Amazon service was great, it arrived well packaged with no damage to the safe. After reading some of the other reviews I was a little worried about the robustness of the safe, but it is heavy (which I wanted so that it could not be easily lifted), solid and well-constructed.Everyone needs a good safe and this is a good one. For my needs the interior is very roomy, much more than I need at the moment. I am very pleased with this product."
4,Exactly as expected after reading other reviews.,"In my opinion, this safe is a good value for the money. I was reluctant to purchase because of the claims that there had been damage during delivery, and looking at the packaging, I can see why. It does have a little to be desired, however, my safe showed up undamaged in any way. The combination is factory set and cannot be changed. For security reasons, this safe WILL need to be secured in some way. There is hardware included, but I am opting to add a little more strength. Combination lock ""clicks"" when turned. Will it keep out a professional safe cracker? I doubt it. However, I am using this particular product as an alternative to a safety deposit box, and I am quite happy with this safe as advertised."
5,Great quality and service,"We were pleased with the safe, it is well made and easy to use. We bought this one even though it was a little bigger than what we thought we would need, and it turned out we did need this size. And the seller was quick to respond. A good purchase."
3,Not bad... but just OK.,"The safe is a good size safe to store important documents or anything of value. The only bad thing about this type of safe is the combination part of it. I wish I would have gone with something that had a number key pad or just key lock. You would think the combination lock would be easy to open because it's big. But sometimes it will take 10 try's or more to open it and doing nothing different then the first 9 times. Gets frustrating at times, but other then that, I guess it does it's job."
4,Excellent Safe for the Home,This is an excellent safe for the home user with just enough room for many items.
1,Rust and mold developes inside this SentrySafe,"Substantial amounts of rust starts to develope within short order along with apparent mold and odors.Even desiccant fails to bring the humidity level inside this safe down to acceptable levels and the high level of humidty inside of this safe not only rusts out the inside of the safe, it also damages most everything metal that you might want to protect inside the safe.Even where the outside humidity is only 8%. the inside of this safe ranges above 80%.Apparenly the high humidity is caused by the clay material Sentry uses to make the safe fire resistant."
4,"good safe, but not way to bolt it down","this is a great safe, well put together, nice and heavy. the only reason i only gave it 4 starts is because there are no holes to bolt it down to the floor, for me this was a MAJOR issue. this safe was sent to me by the company after my first one stopped working. its pretty great though, nice a sleek look, works well. oh and it doesnt have a slide in compartment with lock, i liked that about my previous one that had broke. this one only has shelves that you can move. but this is a nice safe and its worth the little extra money."
3,"Cheap, but will get the job done","I ordered this safe for basic fire and theft protection. This arrived dented, but Amazon and I agreed to a discounted price instead of returning the item for replacement. The dial on my unit is a little stiff around part of the turn and the door seems to have a bit of gap when closed (something a creative person could easily fix). Overall, I would say this is a value as long as you realize you are only going to protect yourself against fire and a lazy theif. These ""cheap"" safes are far from bomb proof. If you really want to protect your valuables, go buy a Liberty safe gun safe. They are made in the USA and are practically bomb proof...but a little harder on your wallet.Be aware that this safe requires BOTH a combination AND key to unlock or you can just lock the key and leave the combo open. Between that and the clicking combo dial, this isn't a safe you want to rely on quickly accessing in the dark."
1,Cheap in design and horrible in customer service,"Used this safe 2 times and a metal rod broke off. Customer service claims that it's not from the safe, even though I found it inside the safe. After six uses tha handle became so unusable that I could barely open or close the door. Customer service is rude and unhelpful, that is if they respond to you at all. No fix in sight, just my 5 month old safe being abandoned. Buy another brand with no consideration for Sentry. A really terrible example of an American company."
1,Disappointed,Looks OK but is definitely second rate. The door is sloppy after being opened just a few times. I seriously doubt that I am really protected from fire. The handle is loose and doesn't stay at full horizontal after closing. The combination dial sticks in spots. If I weren't so lazy I would return it and go for another brand!
2,Poor Packaging,"I just sent the safe back. When it arrived today I opened the box and found that the handle and lock assembly were smashed. The problem, as I see it, is that the box as it comes from Sentry is not meant to be shipped by UPS or other similar service. The safe weighs over 100 lbs and the box is very flimsy. Inside there are are styrofoam cushions at each corner but there is nothing between the lock and handle assembly except the thin cardboard wall of the box. The most delicate part of the whole thing is unprotected.Amazon is replacing it but who knows how well the replacement will do in its travels?I have no complaints about the way Amazon is handling the problem but I would prefer that the item arrived in one piece."
4,Sentry Safe,It is a heavy safe for its size (which is great because a theif cannot just run off with it). I think it is a great buy for the price. The only complaint that I have is that the door rattles when shut. It is not snug.
3,Wrong item,"I ordered 2 of them as Christmas present to my sons, but did not open until a year later when one of them moved out.It was not an electonic key safe like my first one but the outside pictures look the same. My son did not mind and was actually happy for a manual lock.The other one is still in the shipping box."
3,look,when delivered it is different than the picture. be carefull isnot the same u see in this image.. is very different
1,Cheaper at Home Depot,You can get this cheaper at Home Depot. $189 plus if you are military you can knock off another 10%.
1,sentry safe,"Used it only 3-4 times before the PLASTIC internal locking mechanism stripped and rendered the safe completely useless. Later prying it open with a crowbar and hammer revealed the plastic gearing to be connected to the outer handle, completely stripped by merely hand-turning. Don't waste your money!"
4,DECENT for the money,"The only reason I bought this safe was to keep some papers and a couple of handguns. I don't really keep too much value in it. Mainley, if I wanted to break into it, I would much rather just pick it up and put it in back of my pickup truck. the whole thing empty weighs around 95 lbs. So, don't buy this to put a lot of cash in it, because if they want it, they will take it. Overall, I like the mechanical tumbler better, that's why I chose this safe instead of a more expensive one. The other thing is that it keeps other people in the house from getting their hands on the guns without my permission."
4,Safe and secure,I have been using this safe for over a year and I have had absolutely no problems with it. I am quite happy with it.
5,Great Techno Style,This set is great.My favorites in my techno collection. Whoever loves hordcore techno has got to listen to this cds.
2,Not good!,Very clear image! Probably the best that I saw on this kind devices! No software availble. Device is useless if You do not have Windows Media OS. Absolutely no Linux support. Good hardware... but useless...You have to buy software for ~$70-120 to be able use it....
4,It sure does run hot,"but the analog picture is superb. (I haven't yet gotten the required amplifier for my atsc antenna) There is simply no comparison between this card and either my WinTV 150 or WinTV 1600. The picure is actually crisper than the the analog tuner in my Olevia 27 inch widescreen flat panel. For the price, this delivers a picture with a significant WOW! factor.As for the heat, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for now. It won't sear your flesh, but it's disturbingly uncomfortable to handle after a few hour's use. I'm thinking that after 3 hour's use, it's about as hot as it's going to get. And so far, so good. And did I mention the picture quality? WOW!For that, 12 stars. For the heat, 3. I'll provisionally rate this at 4 stars. If the heat becomes a real problem, I'll delete this review and write a new one that suitably trashes this product. But for now? - I love it."
4,"Great tuner, software is very good","The tuner works wonderfully and pulls in most of the digital TV stations on the cable in the Boston area and has exceptional picture. The dual tuner is nice for picture in picture. The only problem I found is the rather tedious way you have to enter the station ID's. Other than that, it is a great product."
3,Great but needs better software,"My primary reason for purchasing this was to record my VHS tapes to my computer. And that it does about as well as a DVD/VCR recorder. So dollar wise you get more with this especially since the VCR is or soon will be obsolete. And TV viewing is great when it works.For me installation was easy for both Windows XP and Vista. The problem is the software. Windows Media Center is ridiculous (unless you like fancy user interface - translates to overdone but no features) but the application from the mfr isn't any better - a lot of back forth between screens like Internet browsing.Two other problems: for digital I use an antenna. When it works it comes in great. But in XP the software randomly freezes and as luck would have it right during the program, not the commercials. In Vista it actually brings down the operating system - blue screen.If they improved the software and drivers this would be fantastic. Unfortunately, hardware is only as good as its software."
3,Aver PCIE Combo TV Tuner Card M780,"The card works as described, and does well, including quality of HD programs. Be aware - the included multimedia application doesn't get along well with Vista Home Premium's version of Windows Media Center. Even though the brochure in the box indicated that a remote control unit was included, it wasn't."
2,Runs hot,"Functions absolutely flawlessly under Vista 64bit (unlike most other cards such as my older WinTV PVR-150). If not for the next paragraph, I'd give it five stars for just this. Heck, it does better under Vista x64 than my old card did under WinXP 32. (Disclaimer: I tested the analog video only, not the digital.)But I discovered that it was running extrememly HOT, even when just sitting their idle. So hot that you literally can't even touch it. Ouch! I ended up removing it from the case as I didn't trust it. Emailed tech support but they said it shouldn't be warm at all and suggested I exchange it. I returned it and bought it from somewhere else (to ensure I got one from a different batch), and it, too, ran super hot."
2,Delon USED to Rock,I had to change my review. Just placced an order and the product is horrible. It stinks like a chemical with a hint on coconut. Like a cheap hotel lotion. The product completely let me down. The seller did get product to me on time. The packaging sucked. it was in a post office envelope. Weird. But the lotion is the DISAPPOINTMENT. THis used to be my favorite lotion. The smell of coconut was strong and lingered on the skin all day. Now it smells gross.
1,late,I was going to use this as a gift and it has not yet arrived and it is already the date that it should have goteen here
5,Your Skin Will Love It,"After discovering the amazing healing, moisturizing and softening effects of Triple Lanolin Aloe Vera Hand and Body Lotion over fifteen years ago, I am never without a large pump of it next to my kitchen sink and in my bathroom. I even keep a purse size tube in my bag, and another large pump at the office where co-workers have begged to use it, winning many converts over to purchasing their own.The texture of this product is rich, not runny, making it more like a non-greasy cream than a lotion, and only one of the reasons I have loved this product for so long. With aloe vera gel and triple the lanolin than other products, my skin has remained soft and supple from regular use.Don't be fooled by the rock bottom, bargain price of this product. It simply works better than any I have tried of similar or higher price.- Victoria Austin"
3,Hard to Find Locally,I like the product but find the shipping cost to be way out of lline for the product.
3,Great Moisturizer!,I LOVE this lotion! They use it at the nail shop I frequent. My daughter is allergic to most lotions but can use this one. Its not greasy and does the job~~I was happy to find it online at several websites. I am just sad that I did not check out the shipping and handling fees on the site I chose to purchase it from. It comes in the regular or lavendar fragrance.
4,Cocktail Hour Classic,"Love this CD. Had the ""Seasons"" cassette in the early 90's and played it until it shredded to pieces. Heard something similar to ""Tango de Luna"" and ""Song of the Turtle"" just recently and it brought back a flood of memories, so I bought the CD via Amazon. I also have Pasero's guitar Christmas CD, but Seasons is one of my all-time favorites for the ""red wine at dusk"" happy hour. So glad it is still available to order and give as gifts to my friends."
3,Fruupp basks in well-earned obscurity.,"Although groups like Fruupp tend to give progressive rock a bad reputation, there's something loveable about this wacky band. Bad vocals, weak instrumental playing and an impossible-to-pronounce band name aside, they sallied forth into the realm of cosmic concept albums and classical leanings to produce four albums in the '70s. These two titles were probably the most cohesive of the bunch, with Prince of Heaven's Eyes regarded as the band's ""classic."" However, be forewarned. The label issuing this two-on-one CD decided to leave tracks off of each album in order to squeeze both onto one CD. So, you're not getting the complete albums here. And the cut missing from Modern Masquerades just happens to be the best song from that album. Brilliant decision, guys."
1,BUYER BEWARE !!!!!,"This workbook does NOT come with an answer key! The publisher and author REFUSE to provide the key unless you are an instructor. So, how do you check your answers? YOU DON'T !!!!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!"
1,Experience,"I asked for book as per the ISBN but only i got the workbook with a CD, the package was not complete. Better watch out when ordering. Also there was no contact person or number to call to ask for the clarification."
1,junk,"A group of us (seasoned travelers) used this book as a guide. We only used it for a short time as it had very poor directions and wasted a lot of our time. I would recommend avoiding this product. It made for a frustrating time, albeit in a beautiful place."
1,Complete trash,"Don't give this guide a second thought....it's complete trash. We are seasoned travelers and wanted to try something new in Tuscany. Place names and sign indications were mis-spelled, natural markers were not identified; it is clear that the author has not even stepped foot on the path that was described. Total waste of time."
5,"Touching, haunting and absolutely wonderful","I judge books by whether they make me cry (or laugh as the case might be) Love Story made me cry, so did Gone With the Wind and To Kill A Mockingbird...and so did The Love of Seven Dolls. It is not great literature perhaps, but Mouche's story touches the heart. Gallico manages to convince the reader as well as Mouche that the puppets and the puppeteer are separate entities until the end. I would recommend it highly."
4,Charming Story,"The British Hardbound Edition of Love of Seven Dolls was in my parents home as long as I can remember. The cover,title and unknown plot always intrigued me. I finally got around to reading this book several years after I inherited it and it did not disappoint. A charming love story of a down-trodden young girl who falls in love with seven puppets all who have different personalities. It took me a winter's afternoon to finish the book. Now I will read other books by Paul Gallico."
1,Dangerous,"This product is poorly designed and manufactured. The sharp, unfinished edges represent a hazard. I don't understand how anybody could put such a product on the market. It cost me a re-stocking charge to return the item, which I think is their major revenue stream."
4,One of the Ventures' best!,"""The Fabulous Ventures"" was always my favorite album, as a teen-ager, along with ""Ventures in Space."" The songs are great and the sound is terrific, with crisp, clear notes from the band.I am not overly fond of the ""fuzz"" guitar, but I still liked the ""Wild Things"" album. I loved the hilarious take-off on the original ""Wild Thing"" song, with the Peter Lorre imitation.Nobody did instrumentals like the Ventures. Nobody."
4,Shelf Life- a review by me!,"I gave this book a four a few reasons. It was complicated. I like complicated books, but this one wove in many stories in to 1 book, it got complicated. Many of the charaters are involved in eachothers stories, so you have to remember who is who. And then some of the charaters are only mentioned 1 or 2 times, and then forgotten. There were so many begingings in this book, but I could only find a few endings, which makes me a little mad, because if i start reading about something, I want to finish the story and find out what happened to that charater. So I am thinking there might be a sequel in the works somewhere, maybe. I liked this book because it involved so many charaters that do all have something in common, they work in this super market. I recommed this book to people who like books about more then one thing/person. Over all it was a good book, and I hope you enjoy it!"
5,water gal\oves,these gloves seem more durable than previous ones and I am sure that this quality should last for a long time even though i swim with them daily.
3,Interesting Historical Collection,"Somewhere between skiffle, R&B;, pop, and the reggae we know well today is the sound of early attempts at Jamaican pop/reggae.It's interesting from a historical perspective but for most people, there are no hidden gems or forgotten classics you want to add to your ipod playlist ... for historians of the influence of American R&B;, blues and country-western on other cultural's pop music or atempts at creating a ""pop"" music scene - they would find these of greater interests."
3,universal car phone holder,I like the way it attaches to the vent or dash. I prefer the vent mount. The base of the holder should be larger so that the cell phone can rest securely in the holder. You have to pinch the adjustable sides very tightly or the phone will fall out. This could be eliminated with a larger base.
4,OK so far... Good mounting options.,"Installed a few days ago. Grips phone well, in various positions. Releases easily (one button). Careful w/ mounting hooks. They are thin (to fit into vent slats) and have to be bowed when removed (to disengage hook). Just be careful and take your time. Installed, seems solid. Design allows for lots of vent/dash designs. For the price, don't think you can go wrong."
2,Cheap but worked for a while,"I've had this device for my Samsung SCH-a870 phone for a few months now, but recently 1 of the tabs broke off making it useless.When it wasn't broken it sorta did its job. It didn't fit as snug as i had hoped and have had multiple times where the part that attached to the phone would come loose."
3,Universal Car Vent,"Unfortunately the device did not adapt to my vent, so I had to use the supplied adhesive. It did not hold, even though I thoroughly cleaned the area of adhesion.The phone is held well by the holder, though, but the whole setup keeps falling off where it is attached to my dash, because of the poor adhesive."
1,Doesn't work with Samsung S3,"I recently got this luxmo universal car vent holder to use with my phone and it will not work with my Samsung S3,"
1,"I did not like, does not meet all smartphones.",Not for my device Coolpad 4g. Very small. This support is for old cell phones that have small screens. useless!
2,Thought it was going to work,The padded phone clamps caused my phone to take random pictures until I cut away some of the rubber padding where it aligned with the camera button. The clips did not hold on a 2003 Toyota 4 Runner vent fins after a month with out wiggling or slipping. I added surgical rubber socks on the feet to grip plastic vent fins. That reduced the wiggle but then one of the feet broke after another two months. Then I went to the suction cup and that did not hold on either the dash or glass for very long even with cleaning the surfaces. Other than that I liked the clamping mechanism and eject button.
5,Good,"What you see is what you get is perfect if you like small things, works perfect I am using it and works good I like itbecause is on my air vent."
2,Not sturdy,"This mount is actually great for the first two days. I used it on the vent and on day two or three after I received it, it would start moving to the sides when I turned. I would have to readjust every time. I used it on a GalaxySII, it was very tight fitting. So DO NOT BUY."
1,bad buy,"I buyed this item, i dont recomended, because,after feww days use, the stickers does`nt work, and you can hold the phone, not good."
1,Leave it where it's at!!!,"Soooo cheat easy to break, it barely fits my phone have to take off my case to make it fit don't buy it , it's a waste"
1,"JUNK. Poor design, poor materials. Broke upon installation.","I put the spacer on- it broke.I installed it on my car vent- the clips broke.Bad design, bad materials.Plastic clips need to be made of robust plastic material. This is cheap crap.Once again, you get what you pay for. I should know better."
2,Recieved Broken,"When I pressed the release button, it expanded but would not fit the phone and lock anymore. I opened it and replace the faulty spring. It works now."
2,Cheap made item,The clips on the back of the mount are very cheap and broke the first time I tried to mount it. Contacted the company and was advised no parts are available. Tossed it and purchased a different one from a different company that is a lot nicer. Not worth the shipping cost to send back.
1,Review for purchased item,"Dear seller,I am very unhappy with my purchase. I tried to use the sticker on the bottom of the device and it immediately fell off and then when I tried to stick it on again, it no longer would stick. I would advise to anyone interested in this item to think twice before purchasing."
3,Good vent mount for the money....,"For under six dollars (and delivered before the estimate btw), you really can't go wrong with this mount. I chose the vent mounting option seeing as the adhesive mount is rather small and not very sticky. No instructions, but after about what, thrity seconds, I figured out how to install the small plastic pieces to get the mount to fit the vent. The clips seem pretty good, hasnt slid to and fro, and I take turns pretty sharply. I like the one button release, and it fits my rather large phone (Samesung Intercept, WITH case) rather well. Skip the shoddy dash mount option and you will have yourself a pretty decent phone mount for a fraction of the cost. Edits to follow if my opinion of this accessory changes in the future..."
2,Good price,It was easy to install. I think this product is a great idea only my size four fingers broke it after one week so it isn't well made.
2,Terrible,"I bought this for my Samsung S2 expecting somewhat of a snug fit (I don't have a case). It fit for the first few weeks, and then the left vent clip decided to snap, along with the adjustable arm. on top of all these issues, the padding was next to useless. Getting a suction cup holder next."
3,Should expand on both sides,"Would be much better if both sides expanded so the ledge was more centered under the phone (the wider your phone, the worse it will be). Also, doesn't really grip tightly enough so I have to put a velcro band around the phone and mount to hold it in place. My most recent discovery was that my caller asked ""what's that clicking?"" ...apparently, the vibration of the car makes the mount tap the dashboard. I placed a small piece of foam from a pair of earrings under it which has eliminated the problem. Although, despite the minor inconvenience, for the money, it's fine."
3,Hard to install!!,"It is a good product, but it is hard to install in my car vent. Good product for its price."
2,Grip doesn't open wide enough,"The mechanism seems to work well, but I couldn't test it as my phone, the Nokia Lumia 920, doesn't fit. I'm kind of bumped because on the package, it says ""works with any phone"". The maximum width it can hold seems to be 62mm or 2""7/16, 68mm or 2""5/8 if you were to remove the rubber, but even then, my phone doesn't fit.Nowadays, smart phones are kind of wide, I've seen two other phones that are actually larger than mine, so check the width of our phone before buying. My wife's iPhone 4 fits in it.You can see that it really is not designed for large phones because only one arm moves, and when opened to the max, the base is off-centered"
2,Having trouble putting it together,"It's kind of hard to describe, but I had trouble putting this product together. It would not fit together like instructed (or shown on package), so I had to return it."
3,No So Universal,"It says it works as a universal holder, but I don't really see that. It seems like it is actually fit for an iPhone. Anything wider than an iPod does not fit and I have to squeeze my droid razr just to get it to be useful."
2,Cheaply made but does the job okay.,I bought this because it was affordable and I needed something that would hold my iPhone 4 in my car for gps and music. As soon as I opened the package I immediately knew how cheaply the product was made. I broke it in a matter of seconds upon opening it so if you do decide to purchase this just be mindful that it's not a quality holder nor did I think it would be as I got it for around 5 dollars. The lip on the bottom that holds the phone in place is VERY tiny so you really cannot break the closing mechanisms on the sides like I did.
1,horrible waste of money,the only positive to this item is that it stays in the air vent... unfortunately its sole purpose of holding a cell phone is non-existant! the phone doesnt stay set because there is nothing to hold it up! WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!
1,Not worth it,Very small holder if have a case on your phone it will barely fit and if you don't want to put it on a vent the base is small and doesn't stick very well had to super glue it to make it stay. I'm trying another one. WUldnt bother with this product. I have an iPhone 4s. So not sure if this will be better for other phones
