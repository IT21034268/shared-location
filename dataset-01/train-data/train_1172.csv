5,"Murder She Wrote, Margaritas and Murder","I always think the last Murder she wrote was the best but this was superb. Donald Bain really knows how to string along the reader while letting us look over Jessica's shoulder as she solves another murder. The only complaint I had with this book was all the baddies didn't get theirs in the end. There were a few crooks who needed a serious ""legal spanking"" and I wish the author had extended the book only by a few pages to issue a little more justice.I recommend, for an enjoyable treat that you curl up and read this on a chilly, rainy afternoon/evening."
4,Thrilling read,"A young biologist, Chris Bacon, travels to the unexplored regions of the Papua New Guinea, searching for new medicinal plants. What he finds instead is an unknown, rare flower which - as he finds out from the tribal shaman - prevents one from ever getting old. He takes the flower home, hoping to prevent old age and diseases in humanity. What Chris does not realize is that the misuse of the elixir of youth has horrific effects on everyone and that there are forces out there willing to kill for it. Original and philosophical."
3,This guy completely ripped off Mary Shelley.,"Mary Shelley (THE original horror/sci-fi novelist) wrote a short story, ""The Mortal Immortal"", published in 1833. It tells of a man who drinks an elixir that gives him immortality, but he's married, and his wife never drank it, and thus she continues to grow older while he remains young, appearing to still be in his twenties. It describes the strife and conflict it subsequently causes in their lives. Who does Gary Braver think he is?! He should at least give some credit to the person who ORIGINALLY thought of this idea, especially since the details of his novel are so strikingly similar."
3,Decent... but what's the big deal??,"""Elixir"" was certainly not a bad book, but I cannot understand all the 5-star reviews. The story was interesting, but not completely original. The philosophical issues brought up were valid, but explored in a cursory manner. The prose felt clumsy to me, in a few places. Maybe this is not a fault of the author, but there were perhaps a dozen grammatical errors in the book - for example, when clearly referring to an individual, using a phrase like ""...you can't just make a people do something..."" instead of ""...you can't just make a person do something..."" I'm paraphrasing this, but it's the freshest example in my mind, as it's near the end of the book. Also, cocaine comes from COCA leaves, not COCOA leaves - that made me laugh.However, there was a good twist in the last 50 pages that I did not see coming, and the story as a whole was worthwhile. Not great, but not bad. A decent read."
5,connection,"In today's modern bestsellers it is hard to find an author who connects with his audience through the actions and thoughts of his characters better than Gary Braver. In a literary time of wild sci-fi thrillers and seemingly clued-in mystery novels, it is refreshing to read a novel that allows for a combination between high drama and action as well as a clue into the minds of the characters. Braver's style is a true tribute to the east coast, and i look forward to reading more of his novels in the future"
5,"""Elixir"" Touches every base","Braver hits a home run here. The blend of characters, imagination, and action is perfect. The fountain of youth is found in this fine read. This will be a film maker's dream."
5,Pearls Before Swine entertains so darn good!,"This first collection of PBS (Pearls Before Swine) strips is a great introduction to the main characters. Pig, Rat, Zebra & Goat tell it like it is, from their own extreme points of view.It's easy to identify with each of the characters, because we all have a little of each within us. Along the way, there are deliciously bad puns, biting social commentary and pages upon pages of nonsense.Take your first dip into the PBS world here, or re-visit the laughs you've already had. You won't be disappointed!"
1,Wrong item shipped,"I ordered a skimmer/transducer 106-48. I was shipped a 106-51 which looks the same but it does not have the temmperature sensor. I installed the unit, took it out on the water only to find that the temperature didn't work. I contacted the supplier and they said the best they could do was refund $10 of my purchase price because it had already been installed. I guess this is fair, but I do not believe it was my error and they should allow the return so that I can get what I ordered, even though it has been installed. Other than that, it works OK"
4,Excellent spoon,"Wanted a good slotted spoon for vegetables. While this is a large spoon, it's not so large that it can't fit a vegetable bowl nicely. Very pleased with it."
2,Waaaaiit a minute....,Waited on the spoon of my dreams only to get another slotted spoon. I read the description as well as I could and the the picture leaves a lot to be desired if you really want to know how it looks. I neeeeeeeed a large spoon to stir and dip without all the juice falling through the spoon. Sooooo now I own 4 slotted spoons and not one for my other needs. What is a poor girl to do? I guess I will try another store because I am afraid to try Amazon again because I do not want 5 slotted spoons!
4,"Good rack, versatile","This rack is sturdy, with a lot of nice features (shortens when needed, pole extends when it gets full, etc.). Ours has lasted many years with a load of winter coats and boots and hats, and has survived a move without a problem at all. Recommended."
1,it was broken,the springs use to snap the tube in place are already broken when i received the package.the plasteic parts of the rack are flimsy.
1,Not good if you plan to move it around,"Good idea and was nice while it lasted (about 6 months). However, with the 'no tools' approach, the bottom metal pieces always came out when you tried to move the rack - with or without clothes on it. It was aggravating to have to re-insert these in the sides. The last time this happened, I couldn't catch the sides as they fell and the plastic top end connectors broke (both of them) and the rack is now useless. It was inexpensive, and I got what I paid for."
2,This book is free online,"This is a lovely, well researched book about this fun subject. The book itself is great. However, it is available online FOR FREE."
2,White Trash Bible,"This from a previous review here:""The atrocities the Union troops committed against the Southern women, New Manchester and Roswell, Georgia. ( Transported to Northern concentration camps, raped along the way. NONE of them ever to be heard from again) Col. John Basil Turchin, formerly Ivan Vasilevich Turchininov, of the Imperial Russian Army, allowed his soldiers to plunder, pillage and rape the women of Athens, Ala. All with Lincoln's approval.""How does this stack up against four score and seven years of slavery? That's the problem. The book talks about the WHITE South. If you add up every Union atrocity and multiply by a hundred that doesn't approach the damage slavery did to millions of Americans (who wants to argue that they weren't?). If the South was right about everything else and wrong about this they still deserved to lose (and it was a blessing that they did). Deal with the truth."
1,bald faced lies,"As one born and raised in the south, and a student of the Civil War for over 30 years, I never ceased to be amazed at the fools who defend the south. To this day (and this is the year 2000), the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other such organizations still say the war was not fought over slavery. Idiocy. There argument is very few southeners were slaveowners. That is correct. So what does that say about the fools who fought, bled and died so that the rich elite could own their slaves?Sorry boys, but you book is pure nonsense. The south was very wrong. And it remains wrong to this day. Consider the South Carolina flap over the Confederate battle flag. They speak of Southern heritage. That damned flag was put up in 1962, at the height of the desegregation fight. The south, I am afraid, is nothing more than a pit of hypocrisy, just as it was in the days of slavery. I rank this piece of garbage right up there with the Protocols of the Elders of Zion."
1,Redneck racist rhetoric,"I am a white male who has lived in the South all my life and I can assure you these narrow-minded bigots do not speak for me, as they claim to represent the ""true South."" Now, if the Kennedy boys will get back up on the poarch with their banjos, Ronny Cox and his guitar should be along any time now for a jam session."
5,"If you want the truth, start here! But if you want","to hear only what you wish, then by all means, do so...but at the risk of becoming stagnant.Is it biased? No more so than Yankee history. It is high time someone had the guts to tell the truth! Thequestion is....do YOU have the guts to read the truth?"
2,I enjoyed large parts of it!,"I found some truth in this book. It's probably not for everybody, I must admit.But if you keep an open mind and want to learn a little more than you can findin ordinary history books, then this one's for you.What I did not like about it is, that although the author expects you to be opento different perspectives, he obviously gets back to the black and white worldof Joe Public if it serves his cause. BIG thumbs down for that!"
4,A story that needed telling.,"This was a story that needed telling--as someone has wisely said, all history is usually written by the winners to make the losers out to be the bad guys! The authors make a good case that the South DID have the legal right to secede from the Union--after all, didn't the 13 original Colonies secede from the British Empire?--but I could have done without the constant use of the term ""Yankee"" as a perjorative. For that reason it lost one star in my rating, but overall a good read. By the way, the reader had BETTER have an open mind, because if he doesn't, the portrayal of Abraham Lincoln and other Northern Leaders in this book is going to drive him or her right up the wall!"
1,This book's premise is garbage.,"Well, I've seen the praises for this thing being sung by the black helicopter crowd and really didn't want to let this go unchallenged. Yes, it is true that slavery was not the only or perhaps even the primary issue behind the Civil War. It was a question of the Nation's ability to preserve its self by force of arms if necessary. The loonies in Montana may wish to emulate Davis and his crowd and they will be dealt with in a similar fashion, God willing"
5,Excellent summary,"If you need a nice, tightly wrapped package, this is the work. After pouring through scores of works written during and shortly after the War for Southern Independence, this work shows the careful scholarship of the authors and represents and fair and honest portrayal of the records from that period. Raised in a New York government school, I was taught only lies and myths and am glad to have a single volume to recommend to others. Racial harmony was disrupted, and trouble has been going on for 150 years...all as a result of a war fought over the cause of most all invaders: money and wealth. Don't miss this work!"
5,The Founding Fathers would have been proud!,"I took a huge interest in the so-called Civil War at a young age. Learning through the California school system, I discovered that 90% of what I was being taught contradicted what I found in independant research of the historical records.This book brings this all to light, and is a MUST read for Southerners. Northerners who are interested in truth should also take note. My teenage research coupled with books like this is the reason I left the Peoples Republic Of California for the land of my ancestors. Viva La South!"
1,Ridiculous and absurd,"The now-infamous Kennedy brothers produced a work that no self-respecting historian, whether they be Northerners or Southerners, would ever take seriously. They have no idea how to do historical research, their arguments are full to the brim with meaningless statements, their sources are flimsy to say the least, their references lack any authority whatsoever, and their approach is so dripping with partisanship and anger that I find it difficult to believe how any reasonably intelligent and objective person can take this stuff seriously. As a Southerner whose ancestors fought in the Civil War as members of the 35th North Carolina Infantry, I believe in honoring Southern history. What I object to is twisting Southern history into a falsehood designed merely to promote one's personal political and racial views."
2,Research compromised by unnecessary vitriol,"They are on the right track. Facts long concealed and obscured by half lies, half truths and self-rightious northern propaganda are laid bare here. The problem lies in the telling. The facts alone are so compelling that the bitterness in the telling detracts, not adds to the story. The South was and is right. The rightousness deserves the kind of good writing that is the hallmark of the region. A good editor was needed, and missing here."
4,An important tool for setting the record straight,"Kin Hubbard said ""'Tain't what a man don't know that hurts him; it's what he does know that just ain't so."" Much of what we Americans ""know"" about the causes, conduct, and consequences of the Civil War ""just ain't so."" The Kennedy brothers make a strong case that the real reasons for, and results of, the War Between the States have been buried under the myth of Father Abraham and his blue-clad saints marching south to save the Union and free the slaves. Sure, the tone is polemical. But the ""enlightened"" elements of American opinion have been engaging in a polemic against the South and its people for more than 150 years. It's a cop-out to criticise the tone, or call the authors names, and ignore the historical record. There's a lot in here to make the Unreconstructed Southron give a rebel yell. But more than that, this book is a powerful reminder that facts are still facts, regardless of how many decades of whitewash are slathered on top of them."
5,This book must have been shot out of a cannon from the past!,I enjoyed every minute of this book someone finally serves justice to the Old South that has been put down in every form known to man.
1,An embarrassment to the modern south!,"As a civil war reenactor, and passionate historian, I find this book to be morally and historically offensive! Most of the book contains half-truths and distortions while providing very few historical facts. One thing they left out was the Mississippi Draft of Secession which contains, ""we thoroughly identify our cause with the institution of slavery!"" While I agree that the majority of Southerners fought for home and hearth, the fact remains that Southern politics was controlled by a SMALL minority of elite plantation owners concerned only about their own economic self-interests. Also, parts of it are outright racist. In short, I would not recommend this book to any sensible person. The Kennedy brothers nearly make me ashamed to call myself a Southerner! Nearly!"
1,Utter and Complete Bullsh*t,"...I find it very tragic and sad that some poor tree's life was wasted upon these pages. I read this book and found it morally offensive. I wonder if the south was also right about Racism, Jim Crow, Lynchings, Slavery, Oppression, Segregation and Hatefulness? Anyone who found the pages of this script motivating really needs help and the author of this book should help pay for your therapy."
1,Is the war over?,"The war is over but these authors seem not to know it, or knowing it, are out to start a new one. The main theme is Yankee hatred and it is paraded at every opportunity decorated with abundant ""facts"". As there is no logical thread to the story, all the venom leads nowhere.The book has become something of a bible to the Sons of Confederate Veterans and as such it narrows the line between this group, which claims to revere Southern heritage, and the pure haters like the KKK. Both the book and your readers' reviews cause one to wonder if after 135 years any reasoned public discussion of the great war is yet possible."
3,Thought provoking,"This work is definately biased, in-your-face, 100% pro-South-- which is not necessarily a complaint. Many of the Kennnedy's ideas have flaws, and their writing style is mediocre, but if you read with an open mind it'll really make you think about American society, government, and history. Much of the book deals with the cause of the Civil War: was it slavery? The Kennedy's say no. Conventional Wisdom and High School History says yes. But after reading this book I started thinking about wars in general, and the truth is, like any war, the politicians and the common soldiers fought for different reasons. The politicians of the South declared war to protect slavery, but the soldier of the South, who had no slaves and knew he never would, fought for his home, his family, and his honor-- he was simply tired of putting up with Yankee attitude. Similarly, some Northern soldiers fought to free slaves, but the vast majority loved America and didn't want to see her split."
5,Great Southern History,This is a great book for the Southerner who wants to read historical true facts about southern history. Great for any historian who wants to hear the other side not taught by the liberal northern text book writers! A must have for anyone who is of southern ancestry.
5,What an educational read!!,"In all of my research for the truth about the War For Southern Independence, I have never read a book with more detailed information, information that was backed up with facts, than I did with The South Was Right! This is a must read for those who have the difficulty of explaining the Northern Aggression and the truth behind the War. Please read and learn!"
1,Revisionist Garbage,"The only people that would find this book interesting and be gullible enough to believe its outright lies are likely to live in a trailer littered with empty beer cans, pictures of John C. Calhoun and Jefferson Davis on the walls, and adorned with the Confederate Flag. The same people who rate this a five star book are the ones who still cuss at the mere mention of The Great Emancipator and deny the racist implications of flying a Confederate Flag over a state capitol. The Civil War is over and thank God the North won-GET OVER IT! In short, this book is only for ignorant, racist rednecks."
1,Secondary sources ahoy!,"""The South Was Right"" is a polemic mixed in with just enough history to seem plausible to the historically illiterate. The whole book is based primarily on secondary sources, i.e., OTHER books written on why ""the south was right"". Where are your primary sources? The authors did not bother to do even the most basic review of contemporary sources and yet they still managed to get this published! It's astonishing. I guess money-making is the primary motivator for the Pelican Publishing Company, because it certainly isn't producing books that contribute to Southern history. What a waste of resources, resources which could have been spent printing books written by those who lived during the Civil War and its aftermath."
1,so what,"being correct doesn't make you right. the south had to lose this one regardless of the cost ,or a strong central government is impossible. the south lost. to the victor go the spoils.better it hadn't come to war ,but since it did bounderies are drawn and the country is better because of it. stop fighting this war."
1,Unreal!,"Plain and simple this is not a book for the typical War of the Rebellion history buff. Can you say ""one sided"". There is not enough space here to take them to task on their version of the ""truth"".Read it if you want a good laugh!"
5,finnaly,I have known all my life that the south was right.THIS BOOK SHOWS THE REAL FACTS ABOUT THE WAR FOR SOUTHERN INDEPENDENCE.I WANT EVERYONE TO THIS BOOK FROM COVER TO COVER. IF THERE NOT THE SOUTH SOUTH WAS RIGHT THEN THEY ARE IDIOTS.
1,LETS GET REAL!,"Serioulsy folks, this book is sheer revisionist history. Im sure there are some people in Frankfurt who think Hitler was right also. No need to discuss the particulars as I couldnt get through it."
5,Awesome Book for the True Southern Patriot,I would like to answer the critics of this book by saying this:1.Racists were not just in the south after the Civil War but also in the North the whole country was unhappy with it.2.You must not have realized at the height of the Civil War the two countries were the most powerful in the world3.Those who are ignorant are the money grubbing yanks!
4,Thoughtful book,This book relays the Southern point of view regarding the Civil War. Since school books focus mainly on the Northern point of view this book should be read in order to have a complete and balanced look at the events that divided a nation.
1,What a pile of manure,"I was born and raised in South Carolina and I've heard this whining for over 70 years. No one has ever explained why it's ok for states to seceed from the Union, but counties can't seceed from states. Or why draw the line there? Why can't cities seceed from counties? Why can't streets seceed from cities? You get a parking ticket downtown? No problem. Tell the judge your neighborhood doesn't recognize the city's right to build parking meters. Tell him he'll have to negotiate with your street's mayor. If these people don't like being Americans, let them leave!"
4,Good book from a Southern viewpoint,"The Kennedy's have penned an interesting account of history from an un-PC, Southern viewpoint. This book has brought to light (among other things) the rights of states to secede, the contributions of black Confederates, and depredations committed by the Union army. While the term ""Yankee"" being tossed about might cause some to not finish the book, they would be well advised to continue. This book isn't just opinion. It is composed of FACTS, facts that are sighted again and again in the back of the book lest anyone should think that the Kennedy's made up everything they wrote."
4,A fairly good work.,"This book is sure to give the PC types fits of anger but only anger derived from being wrong. While the book does tend to gloss many things that tarnishes the Confederacy, it brings out many important facts that have gone without notice such as the South's right to secede and the contribution made by Black Confederates. While many PC'ers will pooh-pooh the very concept of a Black ""Rebel"" because they've never heard of it before, they should remember that the populace at large was ignorant of the contribution made by Union Blacks until the movie, ""Glory"", came out. If you want another piece of the Civil War puzzle, definately read this book."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"After having read the Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World (a quite good read), I was expecting something similar with the British Empire tome. However, I am sad to say, I was a little disappointed. A book dealing with three centuries of history is unlikely to be ""complete"", but the style is very patchy with significant areas omitted altogether. Saddest of all is the lack of any detailed analysis of events during and post-Suez, other than a cursory look at the realignment to the EU."
3,Ok for the Price,I just received it and it looks really cheap but it does the job. I used it on the straight razor I just bought and it does the job.
1,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, look elsewhere","I have been using a straight razor for some time. I ordered this strop for my apartment. It came in a box that was 5x7...do the math on the dimensions - this will bend the strop. A bent strop means an uneven sharpen. Upon opening the box, it was cracked in two different places. The cracks were 3 and 2 inches long. I tried it out for the heck of it on a practice razor that I've had for a long time and it was unevenly sharpened. Spend the extra buck, don't take the easy way out, and stay away from this item. I am sending it back and we will see if they reimburse me."
5,Perfect for Workroom,"This strop is a nice size for the workbench to keep filet knives, chisels, carving Knives, etc, with a keen edge."
3,If your looking for chickflicfix,"Not bad, not awesome, but on a rainy Sunday, when you don't want to watch Tess or Jane Eyre(Timothy Dalton version) for the 15th time, this will do."
1,This book is not too great for beginning virologists,"Medical Virology is not an ideal book for students new to virology. It is currently the prescribed text for an undergraduate course that I am taking, and unfortunately, the book is not well done. Fortunately for me, I've had other courses that provided the background that this book doesn't present in a coherent manner. The book introduces a topic, starts to explain it, and then just drops it. While it might be a good overview for people familiar with virology, students just starting out would be better served by buying Fundamental Virology."
1,Not as described,"I thought this book would be chapter legnth stories by people who visited paris. Instead, it is more like a listing of places to stay, places to eat. There were some essays, most a page or two, but they were not helpful. One example of an essay was a professor from New York who wrote how the French are rude. Another 2 page essay was on ""cheap places to eat"", but the cheapest resturant was over $75.I want to enjoy my trip, not start out finding things not to like."
1,not long enough (esp. if you dont read the dimensions),Here is another example of me not reading the dimensions. This was not long enough for our stand up shower. Besides that it is a very nice product and works for our tub shower just fine
3,"When something is named ""BEST Quality"" and ""Commercial Grade"" I would have expected more","I went out of my way, researched and payed extra for what I thought was a ""commercial"" grade shower curtain liner. What I got was the same thin liner that I could have gotten for alot less money. I am disappointed. Lesson Learned - don't expect ""commercial"" quality when they don't specify guage and it's atleast 8 guage vinyl."
2,Not too hot...,"After a friend of mine let me try his ""Dave's Insanity Sauce"", and I loved the heat kick. Since Dave's can only be purchased on-line, I had a limited choice from my grocery store. I was suprised to see Ass Kickin' Cajun Hot Sauce on the shelf, and from looking at the name I guessed it would be hot. Well, after trying it on a burrito, I can say it is not that hot. And the bottle only lets you put a drop on at a time. I spent more time trying to get hot sauce out than eating. And since it was not as hot as I wanted, I kept putting more and more on tyring to get some heat which lead to another problem- the taste of vinigar was too strong. Too bad, I was looking forward for something really hot. I guess I will have to wait for my internet order to come it. For those of you who eat tobasco, this is better than tobasco and has a little more heat. For those of you who want very hot, look elsewhere."
3,Dead pixels?,"First got this monitor and it had a dead pixel right in the middle of the screen.So right away something is wrong with it.Sure they give you a warranty but YOU pay the shipping, which today is around $40.Just not worth it for 1 dead pixel. But hey SAMSUNG HAS LOST MY BUSINESS.It does work fast and other than it hurts my eyes I have had no real complaints.It gets 3 stars. I would personally buy this in a store and have it checked for dead pixels before i purchased or get a different brand monitor."
3,Very Good Monitor,"the monitor is working well, but if you don't have a digital video card in you computer you can't get all of it. the quality is no so great.. I would say an average..."
4,Great deal,"I've had this for about 2 months, and despite a problem am happy with this purchase. A week after I first received, the monitor failed - first, display waivered occassionally and then went black; finally it stayed black: no diagnostics, nothing. I returned and got a second and this has been trouble free. Return was a simple process (I've done before with Amazon and it's always gone well). I've worked with pc's for 25 years, and a first week failure isn't a surprise.I use the samsung with a standard 19"" lcd - decided I didn't want a large widescreen so I could use two displays without overwhelming my eyes. You can see the difference in performance, with good colors and response time of the samsung compared to my older lcd. The screen is large enough to show alot of information, but works well with a second monitor - and the price for its performance was great.We've had multiple samsung products, and except for the failure above have been satisfied with them all."
5,Great product for the $$,"We are very pleased with our recent purchase of the excellent 19"" monitor. We simply plugged it into our Dell 4xxx series computer and worked instantly. I would recommend this monitor to anyone wanting to do away with their old CRT or looking for a beautiful 19"" screen."
5,Amazing monitor,"This monitor it's just amazing, and really beautiful. The only thing that I note it's too brightly. But i'm not have nothing to regret."
1,Not user friendly,I had a lot of trouble switching from my old CRT (which had better color and clarity) to this new sleek model. Even after downloading new drivers and several phone calls to the Samsung Help Line I am not completely satisfied.The monitor angle cannot be adjusted so I had to buy a little platform to get the monitor up to eye level.The monitor is lightweight and beautiful to look at when it is turned off and I don't have to use it.
5,Samsung Quality,"What can you say, Samgsung has done it again. Nothing bad about this monitor. I have an older Dell and was concerned about it being compatiable my system. When I hooked it up, it almost installed it's self. The CD that came with the monitor auto started and things were as smooth as silk. It's nice to be able to see all of your work and not have to scroll around.The only thing I had to do was adjust my resolution a little and the brightness to suite my needs. Other than that no problems. Thanks Samgsung."
2,Squat screen -- better for DVDs than work,"This is a squat monitor -- more appropriate as a dorm room TV/DVD player than a work station. The resolution is good and the colors crisp as could be -- but know what you're buying. It's no taller than a typical 17"" and everything looks stretched, even after adjustments."
5,VitaMedica Surgery Program Kit,"The kit helped my bruising to go away quickly, so that I could return to the public and my job."
4,Grandson loves it.,"I was surprised that it was made out of plastic. However, it seems to be durable and had great detail. My six year old grandson loves it."
2,Nice to look at but easy to break,"I bought this truck for a 3-year old boy and within two weeks the hitch and two panels were broken. That's about $15 in overpriced replacement parts from Bruder. The plastic used in not durable for normal play and this is assuming you keep it inside. It's definitely not an outdoor truck! If you purchase this truck, I suggest that you save all the packaging and be prepared to think of a replacement gift for your boy."
2,"Goes on easy, but takes paint with it upon removal","I (and more importantly, my son) really liked this wall decal. It was easy to apply and it looked great. If I had rated this product 2 days ago, it would have received 5 stars. However, we needed to do some rearranging in his room last night, which meant relocating this decal and several RoomMates dino decals to other walls. The RoomMates dinosaur decals came off very easily and were happy in their new locations. The Dino Egg decided it needed to put up a fight. I started peeling (very gently) from the top, when I noticed that the adhesive was staying on the wall and not the decal (which means I couldn't relocate it). About an inch later (the dino's chin), paint was coming off with the decal. Removing the sticker was a disaster. No matter how good it looks on the wall, it's not worth the damage it causes upon removal."
5,Excellent Sequal for an Excellent Book,"Though I knew Ms. Carroll was talented from reading her earlier books (Winterbourne and The Bride Finder), the NIght Drifter blew me away. The delicate and sweet blending of a gothic romance novel with the tragedy of Sir Lancelot was truely remarkable. I can only say Bravo! to an accomplished writer and hope her next book can follow as well as this one did The Bride Finder."
4,Great Escape,"The Night Drifter is a gem of an escapist book! The second in a trilogy, this book was an enjoyable read even though I hadn't (yet!) read the others. Susan Carroll builds a believable world in which a nineteenth-century family is rumored to have magical abilities--rightly so! The naive heroine hides from the bleakness of her life by pursuing an interest in legends. When she meets the hero in his magical form and mistakes him for the ghost of Sir Lancelot du Lac, she thinks she has fallen in love. No way, then, will she accept the Bride Finder's pronouncement that the hero is her One True Love. The hero's dilemma, in which his rival is HIMSELF, is priceless. Plot twists and turns add spice throughout, right through to a surprise ending. Please excuse me while I go purchase the other two books in the series,The Bride FinderandMidnight Bride: A Novel."
3,In the minority,"I read the BRIDE FINDER and couldn't put it down however, there was a bit of wading to finish the NIGHT DRIFTER. My problem was with the 2 female leads. I couldn't sympathsize with Rosalind and found her at times annoying. Obviously, since I buy and read romances I like escape but up until the end her mousy and her escapist behavior was irritating. Given a flesh and blood Lance or a ghost...it was very difficult to believe her dilemma. Effie was just irritating and too self centered to be found even amusing......the glinpses of Kate however show promise and I have high hopes for a sequel with Kate, Val and Rafe (whom I feel should be given some happiness...dare I suggest by marrying one of Anatole's daughters----just a thought."
3,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this film because it's a Chekov play adaptedto the screen AND Franchot Tone is in it. The problem is it doesnot have subtitles and the dialogue is very hard to understand. Tone is wonderful--to bad I can't understand most of what he says. It's in English. Let me be clear--it'sa wonderful adaptation, except for the soundtrack,which may be from a inferior copy."
3,Round Trip: The Near Death Experience,"Very interesting and insightful. Gave me a new perspective and understanding about near death experiences. PDA, Esq."
1,disapointed,"This is not a narrated video that explores the phenomenom of near death experiences. The video consists of several individuals, sitting down, telling their story. It is poorly shot, the audio is bad (sounds as if the people are off mic)and there is no supporting video for the stories. If you're looking to simply hear tales of near death experiences, this is for you - otherwise - look elsewhere!"
5,Excellent service,"The book more than met my expectations. Amazing research by the author and most appreciated.The book was at least as good if not better than described.Relative to providing prompt shipping and delivery, I couldn't have expected any better. Thanks."
4,Who you gonna call? My Pocket Sponsor!!,I've known about this book for some time before purchasing and was struckby the wonderful tidbits of wisdom found on every page. I like to have severaldaily readers on hand to draw inspiration from as I start my day and this pithylittle tome is one of my favorites at the moment. Having purchased the electronic versionthis helpful recovery tool gets read everywhere I can take my phone or Kindle.If I need a shot-in-the-arm to help me through a impending slip or situationthe Pocket Sponsor helps me get the focus back on the program's principals.
3,Keep it simple,This book has great information but is overload for someone counting days. I find it useful for someone like myself who has more time who needs reminders. Keep it simple.
5,I like the short bits of wisdom in this volumn.,"I'm amazed at the many simple, brief bits of wisdom I find in this book. It's so easy to read just a few and then go on with my day and come back another day and not feel like I've missed anything, each bit of wisdom is self contained."
1,Not what you think,"This is anything but barbeque sauce, more like barbeque liquid. I could have saved my money and bought a bottle of vinegar, and seasoned it myself. This stuff tastes awful a waste of money!"
2,Watered Down Tabasco,"It kinda tastes like watered down Tabasco mixed with liquid smoke flavoring... That and it also came leaky in the mail. It was inside a Ziploc bag with the sauce all over the inside... the seal was still on so I tried some anyway but I won't be finishing the bottle.I suggest you save the money and just spice things yourself... It did ship super quick though, which I guess is a plus."
1,The Worst...,"There is no kind way to say this. This is terrible. There are several reasons why:1. It is thin like water2. It stinks (I could barely taste it without gagging)3. It is vinegar based. If you think you would enjoy dipping your nuggets in vinegar then you would like this.In addition I was mailed expired BBQ sauce. When I contacted Julia's Pantry about the fact that it was expired they accused me of confusing the lot number with the expiration date. It clearly said August 1, 2011 on the lid. They wanted me to mail it back to them. If I could do that I wouldn't have ordered BBQ sauce online. Not everyone can get to the post office. What a complete waste of money and time."
1,Hot Sauce Water,This product was totally useless ~ Thin as Water with a flavor of Cheap Hot Sauce. Do not Waste your money. Still have 4 of the 5 bottles left ~
5,Velcro Watch Band,"How do you rate a watch band. Well, I gave it 5 stars because of its quality. This is my first ""Velcro"" closure watch band...and I like it! I prefer wearing my watch close to my wrist. I hate expansion bands that loosen up and slide. This one stays put, because you adjust the tightness each time you put it on. Attractive too!!!"
2,Didn't hold up...,"With a name like Expedition, one would expect this watch band to stand up to the rigors of travel and adventure in the most exotic of locales. Well, it is certainly stylish and attractive enough to appear in a National Geographic photo shoot, but will likely fall off of the wearer's wrist as soon as the cameras are off! I purchased the item last year as a spare and put it into service this spring. After four months of use, it tries to fall off even when I'm sitting still. The velcro strip did not provide a very vigorous closure when it was brand new and it steadily lost its grip even further over time. If the most strenuous ""expedition"" you have planned is a chaufferred trip to the mall, and you regularly replace your watchband every few months, then you'll do fine with this band. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
5,Takes a licking ...,"... you know the rest. I like this band. Simple to get on and off in the dark. Goes well with my Timex Expedition watch. I could do without the product badging, but those are easily removed."
2,Disappointed,"We heard Carlos Reyes this summer at a concert in California's wine country. He plays the harp and violin and we were very impressed with his talents.People were on their feet dancing and yelling for encores.This CD must be one of his earlier ones and is very tame...would be great for background music. I wanted to hear his toe-tapping, heart racing type music that he played amongst the vineyards. This isn't it. So, if you like elevator type harp music, this CD is for you."
2,"Heavy on history and political detail, very low on romance","I have to say that my thoughts on this book are exactly what my thoughts were on another work by this author, 'Sweet Talking Man'. I felt like the political/historical part of this novel was the main focus of the book, with a romance sort of tacked on. There wasn't any real chemistry between the characters, and the author never really made it clear why they should fall in love with one another. That magic 'spark' that makes a romance work just wasn't there.After being bored by two of this author's books, I don't think I'll be trying another. It seems that historical/political plots with a back-burner love story are pretending to be romance novels when they're not. If you're looking for a moving love story, this isn't it."
2,Horribly remastered!,"I was really looking forward to replacing my scratchy album with this CD. The disc says ""Remaster in High Definition"", but the sound is AM radio all the way. I imported the waveforms into ProTools, and the ""remastering"" consisted of squashing all the levels to 100%, all the time. The resulting sound is crappy even on crappy speakers. There's no reason to distort the sound this way, and I hope they undo their remastering on the next batch of CDs."
5,life is you,"life is you is one of the pieces that was missing in the jig saw puzzle of my life. I was 21 went life you was released and now I am 47. Now i need to hear ""home again"" and ""poor mans dream"" off their first album. Is there any chance it will be released? Life is you is going to be a great xmas gift to give out to my friends. I still have both albums but this remastered c.d. magical."
4,70's College Daze,This was one of my favorite albums in college. I think it was 1971. The vocal harmonies were fabulous and the twelve-string guitar playing was beautiful. I have both albums(vinyl) but would really like to see a release of their first album on CD. If you like folk/pop/rock you have to hear this music. It's feel good music from a good time gone but not forgotten.
5,A MUST for recreational readers interested in human nature.,"The storyline leads the reader through the thoughtprovoking, easy-reading that lends itself to light reading; yet causes the reader to think ""what if?"""
1,Product did not come with a straw,The instructions on the product indicate to attach the straw to the nozzle but no straw is provided so it's not usable.
1,Watch Out!,"If you are thinking that this is collection of original great tunes, THINK AGAIN!!!!! These are not the songs you heard on the radio. The Drifters songs aren't by the original Drifters, Elvis's ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" sounds like it was taped from a radio and Elvis has swallowed the microphone. These are ALL remakes by someone using the old do-wop groups names. DO NOT BUY THIS FROM ANYONE AT ANYTIME!!!! It's a rip-off from an English company called 'New Sound'. Be afraid....be very afraid."
2,Burnt copy,"I thought it was an original DVD, but when I received it, it was a copy of the movie. But u get what u pay for."
3,Great for 1 device,"Works great for one device. But I have this hooked up to a switch, then an Xbox and a video device. Trouble is that this adapter takes the MAC address of the first device it sees. Basically this means you can only have one device connected to the WGE111 without having to reboot the WGE111 then turn on the other device."
4,WGE111 54 Mbps Wireless Game Adapter,"Bought this to use with my Xbox 360. If you use security then you have to set it up on your PC first, then it just plugs into the 360. Needs its own power block though, unlike the Microsoft one.Has worked flawlessly since connecting to the 360."
1,don't buy this!,"not only is this product hell to get working, there is absolutly no tech support (unless you are willing to pay). And nowhere is it ever explained how to get this product working while keeping your security setting. apparently, you have to turn off your firewall, your anti-virus and any wireless passkeys or protection in order to use this product."
2,Crashes under heavy load.,"Works fine under light use, but crashes after a couple of hours of heavy use (streaming audio or video.) Sometimes only the embedded configuration web server crashes, but the unit still operates as a bridge. Usually, it's a more serious crash, and requires a power cycle to get working again. I'm using WPA-TKIP."
1,You've got to be kidding...,"At the risk of empowering the author's ""Inner Critic"" to beat the bejeezus out of her ""Inner Child,"" this book is awful. Those who do not have serious mental and emotional issues will find it useless, and those who do may find it damaging. This book offers few to no actual examples of self-sabotaging behavior (other than the catch-all self-sabotage of ""listening to your inner critic"") nor does it offer concrete recommendations on how to stop or avoid such behaviors (other than ""don't listen to your inner critic""). Unless you're into really stupid pop-psych self-examination exercises, you will find nothing here. Don't waste your time."
1,Drivel,"Mindless drivel. Ouch.I am intelligent, good looking, and reasonably wise - yet I keep taking actions both personally and professionally that sabotage my own success. ""Bathing in white light and imagining dark arrows coming at me..."" is less than helpful in understanding and redirecting the sinister nature of recurring self-defeat.It's more likely that I get more goodies and connection (in the form of sympathy and compassion) from those who are close.This is pop-psych gone bad."
5,Incredibly insightful!,"I discovered the ""Keepers"" series two years ago. At first I was unsure of the format, and it took me a while to appreciate all the activities, but now they are the foundation in my homeschool curriculum. The stories and activities are suitable for a wide range of ages so that they may be used for years with the same child. There is so much depth and insight to all of the Keepers books that it is a compliment to any style of homeschool. For naturalists, home schoolers, un-schoolers, classical educators or public schools - these books are absolutely a must for every child living in North America! I can't say enough about these books."
2,Kids don't like the puppets,"Our kids love Caillou, especially our daughter who is almost 3. When we turn this DVD on, she tells us she doesn't like it! It is because it has puppets between each segment. Though it is an new release, it is the old format. The episodes themselves are fine, but tge puppets ruin it!"
5,An easy-to-use cookbook enticing for all food lovers,"I was surprised with this cookbook. Unlike most cookbooks I own, particularly if they are received as a gift, I have used this book a number of times. It is varied with receipes suitable for all meal courses, I have held three 'informal' dinner parties from this book alone. The receipes are interesting and enticing for all food lovers, vegetarian or not. The food is informal and edible rather than formal or cordon bleu. It is easy to use and easy to read with pictures of the ingrediants and the final dish to help you. The recipes are simple to follow, in a step by step style with illustrations, if appropriate. I would recommend this book to anyone but particularly a vegetarian who may struggle with cookbooks."
4,Essential For Tarantino Fans,"This book is a nice introduction for novice Tarantino fans and satisfying for the hard core fan also. D K Holm explores every thing from Q's childhood up to his future project ""Inglorious Bastards."" The book is well written, informative, easy to read and a great alternative to higher priced books that are ten years out of date. This is a great book if you can find it!"
5,A Real Brett Favre lover,"Missed seeing this video 16 years ago, I never thought I would find one again. New condition and fast delivery.Very PleasedCarol"
4,"Finally, the Pack is Back",This is more a highlight reel of the Packer's season and some history rather than a tape exclusively about Super Bowl XXXI. But being a Packer's fan I thought it was great.
2,"No, thank you (a retread).","I dunno about this album. I've got everything Jade Warrior did in the '70's, and this just sounds like a forced, uninspired return to their glory days (the drum machine is horrible). It leaves a bad taste in my mouth....it's almost like a parody of their Island material. I have to force myself to listen to it to write this (not a good sign). If I was gonna be more diplomatic, I think I enjoy this one more during the mellow bits, but it's nothing they didn't do MUCH better earlier on albums like Floating World and Kites. It seems like they were adhering too closely to a New Age aesthetic. Just look at the song titles....""Evocation""....""Timeless Journey"".......""Night Of The Shamen""? Cliche.And by the way, for the guy (girl?) who was asking if the lyric ""And it's alright, sitting in firelight"" was Jade Warrior, yes it is, and it's the first song on Last Autumn's Dream (my favorite JD album), ""A Winter's Tale""."
5,hot,its a good looking suit. i ware a small in all things . but not this it should have been a m. think of getting a size biger than what you ware
4,THONG SWIM SUIT,THE SIZE SHOULD BE BIGGER THEN WHAT YOU HAVE DOWN.SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN AN XL INSTEAD OF LARGE. OVER ALL ITS A GOOD ITEM.
4,Artists Photo Landscapes,"this book was a gift for my brother, he has stated that he has recieved the book in a in a timely fashion and also enjoyed this book."
4,We should all strive to be this balanced & responsible.,"Peterson has provided a rigourous review of recent political and economic difficulties in America and suggests what we all should be doing to avoid the ""train wreck"" that seems just over the horizon.While at some times dry, this book is one person's honest view on how we got in the mess we're in today and gives some insight on what needs to be done to correct it. Peterson, a Republican, illustrates how both parties have been equally uninformed and irresponsible. He does not pull punches and, thus, the ""dryness"" is well overcome by the honesty, credibility and effectiveness of his overall argument.This book provides some very useful insight into America's current political and economic situation and will leave you a more informed (and hopefully more engaged) citizen."
5,Very comprehensive- a wake up call to America,"I wish more Americans would read this book.The basic point is that spending is out of control (especially during this Bush administration). The situation will only get worse if nothing is done due to cost of Medicare(mostly) and Social Security. Also the Bush tax cuts are completely unaffordable.A good start would be to reverse every fiscal decision by Bush and the Republicans, and then take a look at cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits."
3,Both Repetitive and Redundant,"Peterson raises a number of valid points about the direction of the economy, government waste, and the battle to maintain both an increase in benefits and a decrease in tax rates. I did not enjoy the book because it seemed as if the author made all of his key arguments within the Preface, and simply repeated them to no great effect throughout the remaining ten chapters. I respect his arguments, and I certainly do not disagree with his analysis. I simply feel that his point could have been made in a much shorter format."
5,elmer batters the caruska,"love the photography, the models and the fact this is a tiny little pocket book something with time would probably be worth something it arrived great in perfect condition.i will continue to buy from this artist and or publisher very erotic book."
2,Don't waste your money.,"If you like the short stocky fat legs, buy this one. If you like stamp size book, buy this one. If you one woman man, buy this one. Otherwise, save your money, buy other real legs book."
1,Are all vertical DVD players bad or just this one?,"I had a vertical DVD player purchased about a year ago to fit beside the TV due to space limitations. I loved the convenience. When it stopped working.....just stopped....I wanted to replace it with another vertical DVD Player. I did an Amazon search and found this one. It took a little more than a month before it started freezing/skipping. Big price to pay for something that just stops working. It appears, after reading the other reviews, that this could most likely be a common problem with this model."
1,Skip - Skip - Skip,I returned my unit twice and it still skips on almost every movie. Learn from my mistakes - Don't buy this!
1,Philips technology? disapointment,"I buy a dvd player 3 years ago with the same technology of this one and believe me a prefer teh last one, the firts thing discover was a progresive scan is a fake! looks a same in this player (a buy the video component cable and a have a HDTV), second when the movies ares already played and i want to swich the subtitles the machine get froze and automatically turn off, the setup menu is too poor and restricted, finally this DVD is not for ALL REGIONS, just play region 1!I am very disappointed with thw philips technology"
3,Important but boring,"Important for what it reveals about our national history, but could have been 100 ... strike that ... 150 pages shorter."
5,"Wow! Beautiful, educational and fun!","Kristin Joy Pratt-Serafini began writing her fabulous books at age 14. In her fifth book, Kristin has taken her journaling habits and transformed them into interesting and educational masterpiece.Saguaro Moon takes you on a journey through the Sonoran desert (and through the seasons) while educating you about deserts, the plant life, insects, birds, reptiles and other animals. Obscure facts are included along with references to other books, web references, and an invitation to become a Planet Scout. This is a great book for any child, teacher or home educator!"
3,Big disappointment,"My son was so excited to get his delivery truck for Christmas, but after it was put together I haven't seen him use it. The quality is sub-par. Even the packages that come with it (that look like they are made of plastic) are actually made of really thin cardboard, almost paper. I am very disappointed with Mobil. We will not be purchasing any more Mobil products. They are way over priced for the quality that you get. This was no fault of the seller; I would definitely use them again."
4,Nice!,"I got this stuff for our Cuisinart fondue pot. This stuff is idiot-proof to make... I have no kitchen skills and I made some kick butt fondue. Melted real quick, evenly, and it tasted even better. No need to add anything to the chocolate like oil or anything.Only bad thing is I wish the bag had a resealable zipper because 32oz. is way too big for me. Great product overall and I will by it again."
3,"Melts so well, but the flavor's off","The small pieces of chocolate melt incredibly smoothly---much more so than ""normal"" bar or chip chocolate. This makes them perfect for fondue, or for simply stirring into hot milk for a drink. The dark chocolate could be richer and darker; I thought it tasted closer to milk chocolate, and lacks the depth of flavor of really good-quality chocolate."
1,Key features missing,The Folger editions are renown for their annotations - these are missing. A great edition has simply become mediocre at best. Disappointing.
5,Another romantic comedy.,"Yes, this is a romantic comedy, and yes, it is Shakespeare, so that in itself makes it a wonderful play. But this one stands out for me because of the characters. I love Shylock the most. It's a very moving play, that embraces a large number of different dramatic styles. And who can resist Portia? Who doesn't hate Shylock. It has an interesting and fast-moving plot that captivates audiences."
1,Received wrong product,"Paid to get this book mailed from UK because we couldn't find it in the US. We get it, and instead of the Spanish version it was in English, so completely useless as we could have borrowed that version from the library. Not happy but too late to return and get Spanish version, if they really had one."
2,"great condition, terrible customer service.","the book came in excellent condition, but I needed to return it for exam purposes. I had to email twice to receive their return policy. They weren't prompt and I didn't appreciate their lack of dedication."
4,Stained Glass Reflections,"Although this CD was received quite later than my order due to the fact that it was back ordered, it was recived in excellent condition. I appreciated the vendor keeping me updated on the status of the order."
1,Wear long sleeve shirt!!!,"I wore a polo shirt while making my first batch. As noted by all those potential zero star reviews, my machine started to throw popcorn, popped and unpopped, everywhere. One extremly hot kernal shot up my elbow and gave me a severe burn. It took two weeks to heal! I reread the instructions and made another batch...from a safe distance away. Failed again! I no longer own this unit.I've decided to take another chance on a hot air popper and bought the Presto PopLite Hot Air Popper. SUCCESS!!! I can pop corn without the need for OSHA approved uniform."
1,Popcorn everywhere,"This was a total waste of money. The popper actually propelled itself off the counter and was put out of it's misery during it's second use. Perhaps more importantly more popcorn was on the kitchen floor than in the bowl when all was said and done. There must be a better model on the market, don't even think about buying this."
1,TERRIBLE Popcorn Popper,"If you want to pop 1/2 the kernels you put into the machine, then this unit is for you! The kernels that actually pop are good, but don't break a tooth on those 'old maids'..."
1,piece of junk,The popper spit both popped and unpopped kernel all over my counter and floor. More kernels were unpopped than popped. Hard to believe this appliance ever worked for anyone. Sent it back immediately.
1,Gum like popcorn,"All the popcorn that is popped comes out very chewy. Initially I thought it was the corn I was using, but I've tried about five different brands, and they all don't work well. Also a surprising large amount of the corn does not land in the bowl."
1,AWFUL,"I agree with everything other reviewers have said about this machine. It is loud, doesn't pop much popcorn, and shoots out hot kernals and the popcorn it does pop everywhere. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS! Like the others, I wish I could give it zero stars. It should be recalled by the company. I would recommend looking at the West Bend Stir Crazy 6-quart Popcorn Popper instead."
1,"If you like unpopped corn, have I got a machine for you!",I wanted to see if I was the only one to have such lousy results with this popper. What kernels do pop are tough and utterly awful. UGH! Since I could find no other popper in the stores I also wanted to see if anything else was available so I could rid myself of this Godforsaken piece of equipment. Thank goodness there are others to try. I will be buying another model posthaste.
2,coffee roastery--worked 9 times before burning out,"I purchased this machine to roast coffee. It worked great for the first 9 batches of popping (over several days). Then it burned out. It doesn't turn on at all anymore. I should've read the directions more thoroughly. You can only do two consecutive batches. Then the machine needs to rest 10 minutes. This is good to note if you want to pop more than 1 cup of kernals, or two-days worth of coffee. If you go for batch number 3 (which I did), you can say goodbye. At least it was cheap... and now headed for a landfill. rrrgh."
2,Inferior product,"I just returned this product to the store, after a month of use. It only popped about 40% of the kernels, leaving great numbers of the unpopped kernels in the collection bowl as well as on the floor. If I did not want to waste 60% of the kernels, I had to collect all the unpopped ones after the first round was over and then put them in again."
1,Didn't work long for me!,"I received the popper and tried it out. I put the popcorn in and turned it on. It's very loud but I guess they all are. Anyway, it started popping and then all of a sudden it just stopped. Then there was the bright RED glow coming from underneath the unit. I quickly unplugged it. That's as far as I got. I guess the motor over heated and burned up. It wouldn't come back on even after I let it cool down. So....I returned it and don't think I want to try a replacement. I'm not recommending this to anyone. Not if there's a chance it's defective from the start."
1,0 stars! takes 30 minutes to clean up after!,"I hate this machine. Last night I told the family it was the last time we would make popcorn! It is horrid. It leaves half of the corn unpopped and into the bowl, but that's not even the worst part. The worst is that popcorn will be all over your kitchen. It's on the counter, the floor, the rugs. It's a huge mess. Talk about a waste of time cleaning up after it. Throw this piece of junk away!!"
1,Wish I could give ZERO stars!,"Piece of crap. And that is being kind. Like everyone else reviewing this popper, it was horrible. Dreadful design. Managed to only pop half the corn placed in it. The rest just flew out unpopped. I used it once and returned it.Given the consistancy of the complaints with this unit, the manufacturer either never tested it or didn't care that it was bad news. Either way, it was bad enough to make me never buy another toastmaster product."
1,Toastmaster Popcorn Popper,This popper is horrible. At least 50 percent of the kernals fly out (and I mean fly!) of the machine and all over the room without popping. Not recommended at all.
1,Horrible appliance,"This popper is flat out one of the worst designed products I've ever purchased in my life.1. The popper shoots hot unpopped kernels out of it. The kernels will either burn your hands, or pop when they hit the bowl throwing popcorn all over the place.2. In the 4 or so times I've used it, it popped less than half of the kernels. The unpopped kernels wind up in the bowl or on the floor.3. It is impossible to get the popcorn to go into the bowl. They fly out of the popper at such a high speed, and get thrown all over.Save your money on this appliance, I'm returning mine for a refund."
1,awful,"It popped fewer than half of the kernels, and most of the unpopped ones ended up on the floor.I returned it."
1,Save your money,"My husband and I love popcorn. When we moved, our old trusty popcorn popper broke, so we bought the toastmaster. It is absolutely the biggest waste of money I have ever made. The machine spews popcorn (popped amd unpopped) all over the place, and wastes at least one-third if not one-half of the kernals every time we try to use it."
1,What a POS!,I will just throw my hat in with all the others who hate this hunk-o-junk. It's awful. Sprays out tons of un-popped and some explode in your bowl and litter the kitchen with popcorn. Ack.
1,There's $15 down the drain,"Most of the kernels fly out unpoped and scalding hot (do not touch!!). Alot of the kerrenels pop unce in the bowl and fly all over the kitchen. The unit gets extremely hot to the touch and the popcorn has a chewy, stale taste once popped. Very dissappointed."
1,Attack of the scalding unpopped kernels,"Terrible product. Shoots mostly unpopped kernels (extremely hot) out the shoot and sends them all over the counter. Those that happen to make it to the bowl are projected with such force that they ricochet off it and make a mess. Pops approximately 25% of the kernels placed in it.I've tried preheating it, not preheating it, half loads of kernels, full load of kernels... nothing works. I wish I had read these reviews or still had the receipt. What a ripoff."
1,Worst Hot Air Popper Made,"This is the worst air popper made, my wife and I owned it for about 6 months and gave it a fair chance but it sucks...no if ands or buts. It might be good for roasting coffee beans, but as a popcorn popper it fails miserably. Usually left anywhere from 1/3 to 1/4 of the kernels un-popped and blew the popped corn everywhere. We just bought the Presto Orville Redenbacher hot air corn popper and it is worth every cent. Do make the same mistake we did......"
1,Pops half the corn you put in and makes a huge mess,"You will laugh in your kitchen watching in disbelief as this ""popcorn popper"" attempts to do its job.This is the only air popper sold at Target so I bought it, even after reading these reviews, not believing how impossibly inadequate the product would end up being. It should be taken off the market. I am going back to Target for a refund."
1,don't buy it,"The problem is: it is only supposed to pop corn and it can't do that one simple thing.My cat knocked my old hot air popper off the kitchen counter breaking it. I thought the Toastmaster 6202 popper could be a replacement. Using the Toastmaster on same bag of popcorn 75% of the kernels failed to pop at all. Most popcorn is shot all over the room along with hot kernels of unpopped popcorn. Getting a larger bowl or using different brands of pocorn does NOT fix the problems. I finally spent $10 more for a name brand hot air popper. No special bowls. No special popcorn. I get 95-98% of the kernels pop INTO the bowl not over the kitchen floor. I was very disappointed in the Toastmaster, I had a much better experience with Orville Redenbacher Hot Air Corn Popper."
2,The Toastmaster 6202 performs poorly.,This hot air popcorn popper throws popcorn all over the counter and floor. Leaves a lot of kernels unpopped. Rather small also.
1,Pooped Popper,"This popper sounded like a B52 taking off, left lots of kernals unpopped and broke after about 5 uses. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"popcorn, popcorn everywhere",A joke of a popper...I'm back to microwave bags of popcorn so I don't have to clean up the entire kitchen when this monster spews hot kernels all over kingdom come.
1,Truly deserves 0 stars...!,I have never felt compelled to write a review until now. I can't beleive the people who made this hunk of junk actually put it out in the market. I mean...did they ever turn it on and use it??? It's such a poorly made product it's almost funny...like they did it as a joke...weird to say the least.DO NOT BUY IT...
1,This popcorn popper is wortheless.,"We got this product about a month ago. The first time we used it the lid/scoop melted. It hummed so loudly during operation you had to yell to be heard. About a month after we got it, it stopped working. We didn't ask for a replacement because we didn't want another one of that brand. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,I thought it was just me...,"I thought I was ignorant of the behavior of a hot-air popper, as this was my first. Now that I've read the reviews (from this site) that my dad sent to me, I know that this popper is WRONG. It is a violent machine that sends popcorn in all directions with a force that is frightening. I have to hold a paper bag OVER the opening in order to catch the 50% popped and 50% unpopped kernels. Tonight, I watched the popper spit out a glowing ember that landed and nearly set a nearby cloth on fire. Had I not been watching, who knows... Please, if you care about the safety of yourself and of those around you, DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!"
1,hot air popper,"I enjoy eating hot air pop corn. What I do not enjoy doing is picking up popped pop corn off the floor, counter, and out of the sink. This unit blew pop corn as far as 2 - 3 feet away. It did not pop 1/2 of the corn. The directions said to use 1/2 cup of corn. I did that and had about 1/4 cup corn unpopped. I have used this unit only 4 to 5 times. As soon as I can find another popper, this one will be put in a box for donations. I spent all afternoon trying to find one, but no one seems to carry them like they used to. I miss my old popper. It finally gave up the fight and went to popper heaven (where all good, but worn out pop corn poppers go). Take my advice, do not buy this model, uless you enjoy picking up pop corn off the floor (good way to get your exercise)."
1,Save your 15 bucks,This is an awful product. Pops about 40% of the product and yields chewy popcorn....
1,attack of the hot kernels!,"Once we plugged in our machine and placed our kernels into its little core we were excited about the possibility of oil free yummy popcorn. Much to our dismay the machine attacked us with flying hot kernels everywhere. We attempted to deflect the kernels into their proper place, but our attempts were futile. Half the kernels escaped the popper unpopped and very very hot. If you buy this machine, I would also recommend some protective headgear."
1,Not worth the paper it's written on,This book only purpose is to take your money. A full 1/8th of the book is a copy of the data sheet. A total of 19 pages is dedicated to describing all of the on chip peripherals. Needless to say it was a bit lacking in useful information. There is ONE sample application. Most of the 281 pages is filled with page filling fluff rather than useful information. Stay away.
2,Maybe good for undergraduate students...,"If you're an undergraduate student who is accustomed to reading ""textbooks"" rather than datasheets and user manuals, this book may be helpful. Otherwise, it is useless. As noted in other reviews, much of the information from this book may be found in free TI documents. I purchased this as a reference for use in an undergraduate design project, and even I found very little use for it. If you're new to microcontrollers, you are probably better off studying and learning how to read a datasheet and user manual than reading this book."
2,"OK for newbies, experienced folks shouldn't bother",Not very much info you can't get from the device docs at TI.
1,This book SUCKs,This book is awful. The pictures are awful. Horribly scanned with many errors.This book is a disorganized disgrace to good engineering. If I could return it I would.
1,Run. Run fast. Run far.,"Thin doesn't even begin to describe this. This book is basically several TI data sheets printed out with a minimal amount of additional (mostly useless) babbling, which I can't help but think was intended to be a face-saving measure (it didn't work out). Writing a review of a book sort of implies said book to contain something, anything of substance to write about. This review ends here.Anyone interested in TI's MSP430 line should run away from this one and head over to John Davies' most excellentMSP430 Microcontroller Basics."
1,Save your money,"The book is printed in huge font, thus when it first arrives it looks impressive, but on opening you realize that it could be fitted into a much smaller package. And dont forget the appendix of the 430 data sheet...The content is woefully lacking, just above a very basic introduction.Save your money and buy something else, when you do find a goof book on the Ti430 let me know, I'm still looking."
5,Tired of fumbling around? Buy this book!,"I picked up a copy of this excellent guide through the game out of desperation, when technical problems (not related to the game itself) caused me to have to reinstall Rama and start over. At the time, I had made my way through about 85% of the game's plot line and puzzles, over the course of several months of casual game play. The walkthrough format is very easy to follow, and it allows you to decide how much help you use, because it is broken down according to the various areas within the game that you must explore and solve your way through. A word of caution--the walkthrough is so concise, you may find it hard to put down, and rely on your own skills. If used sparingly, you will enjoy all of the rewards that Rama offers, without getting hopelessly stuck in some of the more difficult areas of the game."
2,It doesn't work!,"I wasn't really that interested in solving the puzzles of the game. I actually dislike adventure games. But I am a huge fan of the Rama series of books and I bought the game so I could explore Rama myself. After getting frustrated from getting stuck, I bought the book to help me get through the puzzles and get through the rest of the game. The book is easy to follow, descriptive, and shows helpful screen shots. The trouble is, I still get stuck, even when I follow the book to the letter. At a certain point, if you supposedly have done everything right, a certain event is supposed to happen in the game, after many tries, it never happens and I can't get any further."
2,Data Station Maxi ul 200GB Network Hard Drive,"The Data Station Maxi ul 200 set up relatively easy. It appears to be working OK now; however it has crashed my network on at least 2 occasions. In the first instance I was attempting to empty the recycle bin on the network drive. I received an error message that said the recycle bin was corrupted, do I want to empty it anyway. Don't do that, repair the recycle bin first! The entire network crashed. The second time it just crashed while synchronizing files, it seems the Data Station Maxi software made one of my computers unstable. I removed the software from that computer and am accessing the network drive through one computer only. It seems ok now. I would not purchase this product again and I recommend you do not purchase the Data Station Maxi ul 200 GB.Mike"
2,Not a great purchase.,Not a lot in here I can use. Very abstract designs - no specific occasions. Not very pleasing to the eye.
4,Novella of literary jealousy and mystery-lingering,"This is one those tales that illustrates James' psychological acuity and storytelling power, while being more accessible to the harried modern reader than his major works. It is a story about our need for mystery and meaning, universal despite the setting of late 19th century literary life."
2,Like a chewy piece of steak...,"It just keeps going and going and going... it's dry, dumb, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. There are a few good laughs, but it's only because Ashton Kutcher and Molly Shannon are true comedians; unfortunately thier types of humor CLASH. To say that Tara Reid can act is the BIGGEST understatement of this decade, not that anyone should be surprised by that cooment... but her non existent acting really kills every scene shes in. She's the ONLY purely serious role in the entire movie and it just does NOT fit well. I do love that they randomly add Carmen Electra to the mix halfway through the movie, it was a nice surpirse to see such a big name come in for a little comedic relief and sex appeal. But overall it may be the most tragically stupid movie I have ever seen... I am a little bummed I even wasted the money to rent it. My Opinion: SKIP IT!"
1,Boooooooo!,This movie sucks! The only good thing about it is how hot Ashton kutcher is in it. Don't waste your time!
3,"Goofy and fun, but it seemed rushed..could have been better.","*MY BOSS'S DAUGHTER PG-13* When all was said and done, this movie was just that, a movie. I had fun with watching it, but it just seemed rushed. Perhaps it's bad editing or lame and predictable dialog, I can't quite put my finger on it, but the flow of the movie is rough and bumpy at best. I felt like I'd seen this all before. It has some very funny moments that make it worth the price of a rental. I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this though. Wait 'till the price goes down, way down. I paid about $8 for it and I got taken for a couple of bucks."
2,Even Molly Shannon can't save this,Now I know why this movie sat on the shelf for almost two years after it was made (and only released when it was thought Ashton Kutcher could carry a film). I also know why Ashton turned to the Kabbalah: to be forgiven for his sins. (FYI: I'm pretty sure this was Tara Reid post-alcoholism and pre-implants.)
2,Stupid... but Funny,"This movie was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. But having said that, it was also quite funny - in a corny kind of way. Don't watch this if you're looking for a real romantic comedy, but on the other hand its quite fun to watch if you have nothing better to do with your time.The actors are not stunning, but play their roles, and the story line is dumb - but that's what makes it funny. The events are completely unbelievable - hilarious though.Watch this if you have nothing better to do - but don't expect it to be anything great."
1,Walk Out!,"I got up and walked after 30 minutes into the film.I am so tired of movies portraying ""responsible"" characters against totally clueless characters who, in this movie, thought nothing of trashing the house, inviting extra people to spend the night, breaking household items, and totally disrespecting someone else's property. The ""conflict"" is irritating and insulting, not funny. There were too many scenes of broken tables and household valuables - good humor isn't that overdone!Many scenes seemed like a young pubescent's idea of a good fantasy - having two girls ask him to check their breasts for breast cancer or having a girl tell him she was going to strip tease for him in her bedroom - not anything believable.The bad guys were too bad; the good guys were too wimpy; the clueless were too clueless and most everything was overdone.I would give this a minus five stars if I could!"
1,This Movie is HORRIBLE!,This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! This movie really isn't very funny. This movie is so stupid and drags on forever. I wish I never bought this movie and saved my money for something worth watching!!!
1,Extremly BAD BAD movie,"This starts out as one of those type of feel good movies where you think it might actually be a pretty fun movie to watch. But NOPE, it goes down the drain. It is about a guy that wants to move up in his company, and impress his boss. And he is also trying to impress the boss daughter. He even thinks he might hit it off with her on a date. But instead of going out with her he ends up house sitting his boss house. And this is when the movie goes straight down the toilet. Not even Carmen Electra can save this movie. If you are looking for an Ashton Kutcher movie, I suggest seeing the Butterfly Effect instead."
1,worst movie ever,"Only film I have ever walked out of the theatre....No redeeming qualities, ZERO stars...."
4,How Does the Title Loop in with the movie,"although this movie was hilarious, i dont see how the title relates to the movie. THis movie is a must have! Youll lyao!!"
3,"Not bad, Ashton.","I didn't think this movie was as bad as a lot of reviewers are saying it is. My mom was even laughing on some parts and she doesn't laugh during movies that often. The plot is simple, but I think we need things out there like that. There were some funny parts in this, I don't know how anyone could have missed those. If you take this for what it is, then you can get some enjoyment out of it. But if you want a movie with a more complicated plotline, then you probably won't be interested in this."
3,"STUPID, BUT FUNNY","This movie is so stupid but it still managed to make me laugh, unlike ""Dumb and Dumberer""(that I also rented tonight) which has got to be one of the most moronic and stupid movies ever made. I could only get through a half hour of it before I had to slam the disc back in its case to be rushed back to the video store."
5,Horrible,"This movie was horrible...There was no laughter coming from me for the entire 101 minutes I watched this movie...For a movie that is supposed to be ""absolutely hilarious""...I would say that that is pretty bad.The back of the DVD says that ""you will laugh your ass off""...the only thing my ass was doing was developing a cramp from sitting on it for sooooo long...Please do not waste your money or time with this one...use it for something with some cinematic quality...such as MYSTIC RIVER!"
3,It was ok,It was ok not too funny. THERE IS NOT NUDITY MOMENTS of Tara Reid. I repeat NONE! So if you were hopeing like I was it ain't gonna happen. Close but no pie. Stick with google if your lookin for that.Crude Humor.... Do yourself a favor Buy Meet the Parents
4,"I reread it, its better than i first thought!","I reviewed this book before and gave it fewer stars. i reread it a few times, and I must say its better than i thought. the ""strategy"" section is not much, but quite frankly you will have to find your own anyway, so that is not so important. the psychological aspects covered in the book as well as the interviews are quite good. Trading only has to be as complicated as you want it to be. you can learn that lesson from this book as well as many others."
1,A book without much practical advantage,"I bought this book with the hope that it will help me in developing day trading techniques. I was disappointed because it contains much repetitive materials mostly about psychologies. I admit that psychology is important but the author does not need to repeat it to make a volume. The readers are interested in how to go about day trading. Really there is very little material that is useful for a day trader. The author presented a lot of charts without clear description of them. There are QA of five day traders, but the contents are about the same, and there are little substantial and practical contents in them. I am very sorry to have bought this book."
2,Very disappointed,"This book is very low in content. What you get is a lot of fluffly pep talk. You get one chapter on Abell's Innergame Strategy, which is not very well explained. And most of the books is Q&A with 5 or different traders, who are all pretty much saying the same thing."
2,"A female reader from october 8, 1999 . Zürich, Switzerland.","I have experienced exactly the same result like the comments of following persons: - The reader of September 30,1998. - The reader ""Ron Lininger"" from Febuary 9,1999 and especially the reader from Sunnyvale,CA,July 21,1998."
4,Not a cookbook but worth a read.,"Howard Abell again stresses the psychological aspects of day trading. People who could benefit from an attitude adjustment regarding their trading should read this book, but those wanting a lot of detailed trading methods should try others, for example, Raschke or DeMark. instead."
4,It does what is says!,It does exactly what it says. Compact & good price but $8 for shipping bumps it up a bit. Arrived promptly. It works on dual voltage by taking twice as long to boil a cup of water in the US (110V) as compared to Europe (220 - 240V). 10 minutes plus in the US but I am sure it is worth the wait for a good cup of tea!
1,Don't buy this!,I fly a lot... I'm an airline pilot. My daughter gave me this heater as a most welcomed birthday gift. I followed the attached directions yet it inexplicably failed to work after using it only 4 or 5 times. i was stymied trying to determine how an object so simple could suddenly stop functioning! Coming here to read online consumer comments in a quest to find a replacement led me to learn of its design to fail. Save your cash. I wish I could find a portable alternative.
5,Why I Bought It,"My parents, when they went on vacation, always took an immersion heater with them so they could have a hot drink when they were in the motel for the night. I decided to do the same. It's a wonderful feeling to be able to make a hot drink any time you want."
2,Died,It died on my second trip! I was not impressed. I should have returned it but had no time to do that.
1,Highest temperature after 15 minutes 180 F,"The whole point is to boil water, to have HOT water-- but this only gets to 180 F maximum,so I returned mine"
4,Immersion Heater Works Well,"I bought this to use at work. The microwave is old and doesn't get hot enough to boil water for soup or drinks, and this does the trick. It's not as fast as a micro wave, but it works well."
1,Immersion Heater Review,"I am extremely disappointed with this product. The plastic clip broke the second time I used it. It heats water, but it takes a long time (greater than 5 minutes) to heat an 8 ounce cup. I don't recommend the product unless you want to overpay for a device that marginally works and is cheaply constructed."
1,doesn't last very long,Item works great but didn't last very long. I brought it in February and it was dead by May. Amazon nor going in style would replace the item.
1,"Cheap plastic, bad feedback and will not stay on wall plate.","Squealing feedback when you pick up to dial. Two part base, but the bottom is loose on the phone and loose on the standard wall plate."
4,Tons of jewels.,Another book that I truly loved. I lived in the time of World War II which always makes a story more interesting to me and I enjoyed the setting of the story and the revelation of all the jewels that I have never had the opportunity to come in contact. I was facinated by the book and they all come to an end too quickly....Katy
1,She cannot write,"Danielle Steel is one of the few authors whose TV miniseries versions are better than the books themselves. Her characters are all rich, beautiful, smart, and somehow it's very difficult to care about these people's fates. Jewels proves to be no exception. Her characters seem cut out of cardboard boxes. The villains and villainesses are comic book caricatures, and the heroes and heroines are all beautiful, noble, intelligent, and selfless. In other words, quite unrealistic. I decided to read the book after watching the miniseries, but what a mistake that was."
1,disappointed,"So Danielle Steel is a NY Times bestseller, is she not? Unless you have been living in a cave for the last few decades, you know the name Danielle Steel. So I thought I would try reading one of her books. I chose the book with excellent reviews, 'Jewels'.This book was impossible for me to read. Too many short sentences. Too little depth of character & plot & storyline. Boring. Disappointing. I won't be reading anymore of her books. I felt cheated from buying this one on my Kindle."
2,A great book with a terrible last 50 pages!,"I loved the first 400 or so pages of the book. My question is who finished it? It doesn't even seem like the same author! I couldn't put it down, it was wonderful- then at the end everything honorable and praiseworthy thing about this book fell apart! I'm rating it so low because it was such a disappointment to read that much of a good book and have it fall flat at the end. When I finished it, I threw it in the garbage!"
1,Depressing book.,"How could anyone enjoy this book? You take a great woman and a great man, and they get married and have four kids, and the kids are all a mess. How does that work??? I found the last third of the book just awful--I kept hoping someone would redeem themselves, but that was a long time coming. She should have ended the book after the War. I also found the shameless spending kind of gross. I like a good escape now and again, but these people just weren't fun. I enjoyed Danielle's older romance novels, but this was just over the top. I wish I could write mindless books like this and have them be bestsellers ..."
5,Here's another one,"Here's another book where I enjoyed it so much, I do admit I liked the TV movie as well. Bad, I know. However, this really is one of my favorite DS. Definately on the top 5. This story takes you to a time & place, you meet so many people...you feel you've lived it, been there...Get a copy today!!"
3,Interesting & educational.,"I felt this documentary ended in a rather hurried way. Otherwise, this is a good resource for those who would like to learn more about scleroderma.As a hospice volunteer, I found this DVD quite informative and have donated it to our hospice library."
4,"Good, basic house plant reference book.","This was the first book on houseplants that I ever purchased, and it is a good all-around houseplant guide.In the front of the book is general information on selecting, caring for and propagating plants. There are also a number of photos demonstrating how to arrange plants in attractive settings around your home. This is nice because the photos in the ""encyclopedia"" portion of the book are nice, but don't let you see the impact they can create in a room.There are lots of plants listed in the encyclopedia portion. Each entry contains background info about the plant as well as care requirements and propagation techniques.Overall, I've been fairly pleased with this book. It's definitely a good one for beginners."
2,"Brilliant performances, poor DVD picture quality","In brief, these are fabulous powerful performances-particularly the Bloch. However the DVD is of very poor quality. Especially noticeable and distracting in the Schumann are muddy colors and breakup. I also own the Japanese DVDs of these recordings & there are no such problems there. Obviously the original masters are excellent. However, for this American release the technicians were slopppy."
3,Be Aware!,"This item is NOT a live collection of songs or a bootleg of a Soundgarden show! It is simply an $8 copy of the ""Fell On Black Days EP"" None of these songs are even live, they are studio recordings."
2,Great Value BUT!!!,The 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor. The mirror finish doesn't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water. The bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd. When 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds. I didn't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set. Finding everything that I needed and used was more important. The set does heat evenly and cook well it's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore. This product is great if looking for style and going to hand it up over an Island
4,Missrepresentation,"This is a very nice set for the money. However, do not be fooled by the description. This is by no means an 18/10 set of cookware. Immediately after receiving this set from Amazon, I called Cuisinart. The representative informed me that if this set was 18/10 it would be so marked on the back of each piece. 18/10 refers to the composition of 18% chromium and 10% nickel which adds to the mirror luster and rust prevention of the product. This set contains neither. Once again, it's a nice set for the money. Amazon just needs to clean up it's act and represent what it sells properly."
2,Cuisinart Cookware,"Nice pots and pans, and delivered on time however the edge of the large frying pan was bent upon delivery. We found that it took much longer to boil water in the large pot, I suspect because these items aren't fully clad."
1,Pass on this....,"Two of the pans came dented. That was great for a Christmas gift :(Amazon did good though, they sent out a new set ASAP."
2,Conflicting price value & product description,"After receiving the 17-piece set in super fast delivery, was disappointed in quality of pans. Told husband to not even take all of them out of the box. They are not heavy as you would expect 18/10 cookware to be. Then did some more research on reviews & product description. Amazon's description of this cookware contradicts itself. One section states the pans can withstand heat to 450 degrees while further down, it states it can withstand heat to 500 degrees.I checked the Cuisinart website for this collection to find it sells for $249--not the $670 Amazon lists it for. I can see it costing MAYBE the lower price. I'm returning to purchase a better quality set."
5,2 months later...,"I held off writing a review so that I could really put these pieces to work. I've been impressed with this set. Enough pieces to suit every need, just the right weight and feel. Definitely not heavy like some others, but definitely not light weight No problems cleaning - maybe a little more attention to cleaning but they clean up well. I've had to break out the Bar Keepers Friend only on a couple of occasions and it easily did the trick. I only do that on the insides. The outside keeps its mirror finish with just soap and water. And cooking is fun - I feel more in control of the flame with these."
4,"First Cuisinart Set, well researched, well worth money.","We purchased this set a year ago for under $200. It was on a sale. We researched cookware and decided for our price point, Cuisinart fit the bill. We have been very happy with the set. The cookware cleans easily, although it does not have a 'typical' easy clean surface. We do not put our pots in the dishwasher, we wash by hand. It still looks brand new! We would purchase this set again!"
5,Even my doubtful wife is convinced.,"My wife was sure she would want to return this cookware. She has always believed stainless steel was not a good way to cook. She has been using a heavy iron non stick set since I met her and I always hated them. Now, after cooking only four meals with the cuisinart stainless she is a convert. We both love how easy they are to clean, any stains come out easily with a little Bar Keepers Friend and a quick rub with a sponge and it doesn't harm the beautiful shine. Very even heating in the frying pans, We both recommend this product."
4,Great cookware for the money,"This is a great set for the little money it cost. I could easily have spent more and gotten less. Cleans easily and cooks well, although I do notice temperature differences in the bottoms of the pans that the aluminum layer was supposed to eliminate, this set still cooks better than my old set and I am very happy."
4,Love this cookware!,"I love this cookware set!!!! The mirror finish is beautiful to look at, it's SO SO easy to clean and cooks like a dream! My daughter wants a set now too so Santa might have to drop a boxed set down her chimney. I'm so very happy with this purchase."
2,was too good to be true,I purchased this set a couple of weeks ago. Although they do the job the pots are immediately stained and nearly impossible to clean. some of the pans turned a yellowish color. I have soaked them and tried brillo to clean them and nothing seems to work . My husband was really upset with these pots and the problem is once you use them they can not be returned .... Invest in a better set
4,great for the price.,Although not a top of the line product ( to which I can't afford) this cookware provides efficient heat distribution across the base giving a more even cooking pattern in the pan as compared the stainless Kirkland brand I had had. I have recommended this set to several folks who are in need of new cookware but just don't have the doe.4 stars because the lids don't seat as well as I'd like.
3,Surface imperfections,Two of the pans had imperfections on the surface. The surface imperfections are unsightly and the pans should have been marked seconds. I would not recommend this product even though the pans cook okay.
3,it's ok,"I guess when you buy pots and pans on line you really dont have a lot of choice on what you are getting I have found small pings on several pots but so small that I did not see it until after I started using it, I was very careful where they were placed when I first got them so I know the pings must have been there only I didnt notice them. Pings are small and i threw out my old pots so decided on keeping the products."
3,Cleaning issue,The cookware look nice. But it has to be carefully cleaned if you dont have time; it can be an issue.
4,We're cooking now !!,"What a great addition to our new kitchen appliances. The pans cook evenly, never stick, clean-up is a breeze. The 17-pieces allow us to cook almost anything ""all at the same time"". Great addition."
5,Great Value,The Cuisinart Chef's Classic set is a great value compared to whats out there. Received this cookware about a month ago and they perform perfectly. They cook great and clean up is very easy. We have ours hanging on a rack and they look great also. Looking to buy some additional pieces.
2,Not what it seems,this product looks great in the pictures and when new in the store but after the first use there are heat spots all over the bottom and it is impossible to completely clean. The color also changes when you have used it. Some pieces look Gold in color while others stay silver looking. Not my favorite purchase over the Christmas Holiday. We will use it though. Seems to cook alright.
5,Excellent product for the price!,"Excellent product, please make sure to investigate how to cook before turning on the stove. Steinless is not the same as non stick, so make sure to start medium low heat to sautee and then add a little more heat if you want to make it crispy but be watchful otherwise the pan can get too hot and burn the food and ruin your pan. If by any chance your product gets a little stain do not worry just use some ajax powder and scrub. I cook on a daily basis most days twice, and I do have a non stick for eggs, pancakes and crepes."
4,cusiinart 77-17 Chef's Classic Stainless 17- Piece Cookware Set,"My cookware came before I knew it, in the designated time frame. The pieces are all perfect and their mirror finish is gorgeous in the cabinets and on the stove. They work great as long as I use a medium or lower heat setting! They heat eavenly and clean up has been a breeze. I have not used the dishwasher yet for them. When food has been burnt on, I sprinkle some dishwashing powder and let it soak for awhile then it comes right off perfectly. Otherwise either a sponge or a scrubby works great. I have any size pan with this set I could ever need. For the money it was the best set I could have bought."
4,love it!,"I am enjoying this cookware set, so far! This is the first time I've owned stainless cookware (I've always had teflon-coated nonstick), so it's taking me a little time to become accustomed to cooking differently. I am a little disappointed in the fact that some of the posts have become discolored on the inside (like the pics in the other reviews). I haven't tried to get the discoloration out, yet. I do still feel like it is a great value, though."
3,lighter than i thought,"I assumed these would be a lot heavier, or thicker. they seem really thin. i havent used them yet. i have owned stainless steel pans before and they were a lot thicker and heavier. not sure if they are made cheaper or if it is new technology????"
3,pans,"was what I ordered according to what was stated. I received my order in great shape,no tears or scraches.Arrived on time.over time these pans do start rusting."
2,dont buy,to thin for my liking but my wife wants to keep them. i will use my old dishes when it is time for me to cook.
3,pretty good for the money,"I was really excited about this set but was let down once I received them. I guess I've picked up too many All-Clad pans and set unrealistic expectations. I should have known better considering the price. The pans and lids are much thinner material than I expected. All that being said, they are very attractive, the handles are very sturdy, the bottoms are solid, and they cook really well. I was hoping I was purchasing the last set of pans I would ever need in my life. That probably is not the case but I will enjoy them while they last."
5,17pc Cuisinart Stainless Steel Cookware,Recently purchased the 17pc Cuisinart Stainless Steel Cookware set and can honestly say it is the GREATEST cookware set we have ever used. The Wife and I are extremely satisfied with the quality of this set and would recommend this set to anyone. This cookware gives you the professional chef's edge for creating those great tasting dishes and healthy meals.I was extremely surprised that Amazon.Com was able to offer this professional cookware set for the price they have displayed. Great buy regardless of your cooking expertise!!
1,Disappointment,"I was excited to replace my old 18/10 stainless steel cookware with this one.The chrome finish has stains from a couple of uses and looks poor.I wish I could return it, but not sure how to do so. I tried looking on site for an option to complain about the quality, and haven't found where to do so.Extremely disappointed."
1,"Not 18/10, Brown Dots after first use!","The cookware looks stunning out of the box. I bought it after much research. I was very disappointed to see dark brown/black dots on the cookware after first use. Upon further research learnt this is not 18/10 cookware as advertised on the site.I got them just 2 days back so I am returning it, Cuisinart does not cover stains and discoloration under warranty."
1,17 piece cuisinart cookware/ TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"I bought this product and threw away my older Teflon pots and pans.I enjoyed them at first even though you need to scrub them immediately after use with a product called BARKEEPPERS FRIEND, a non abrasive cleanser.After a few months 2 of my pans developed smoky black circles and small black spots (the size of pepper).Cuisinart took 4 months to respond to me and now 2 months after they responded they want me to mail the two in.They have no system where they send prepaid postage. With the weight and size it'll cost me over 100.00 and I can't afford that.They also insinuated that my heat was too high.Feels like their stalling for time.TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT"
2,Realy disappointed,"I was really excited about this set. Bought it a month before my move-in date so I couldn't even test it out until a month down the line. Finally took it out of the box 5 days ago and...it kind of sucks. Made eggs the first day with some butter; it stuck. The next day decided to try eggs without any butter or oil; it stuck. Today I tried to use some canola oil; yeah, it stuck. Never EVER had a problem with eggs sticking with OIL in any other pan, so what's the problem?And then I thought to try one of the saucer pots to make some mashed potatoes. I cooked the potatoes first, and guess what? While cooking, some of the ""stainless steel"" cover inside the pa came off and now I have black marks that aren't going away. They're not just stains, they're basically holes. WTF?I can't even return it now because it's been over 30 days."
1,Not Outdoor Pillows,These are not outdoor pillows. As soon as it rained it soaked up all the water and retained it; took days to dry. These would probably work fine as long as they do not get wet.
4,beautiful skin,"Acerola cherry tablets were introduced to me by Dr. Oz. I am always looking for something to improve my skin. I am almost 46 years old, and my skin tends to be dry. I chew two 300mg tablets a day. One when I wake up, and one when I go to bed. I have noticed that my face is more even skin toned, a lot brighter, and a little firmer. I will continue to eat these chewables for the rest of my life."
5,excellent self-help tool,A great addition to the PCOS literature out there covering all the old ground but also adding in new and extremely helpful information about diet and self help techniques. It's beautifully written and clear and consistent throughout. As a PCOS sufferer myself I highly recommend it to other women with PCOS. Good to know that at long last this complex condition is being taken seriously and given the attention and respect it deserves.
5,Very comprehensive,"I recommend this book for anyone who wants to know more about this condition. It explains what the disease is, how to treat it, and what all those tests your doctor ordered mean. There are also chapters about non-medical treatment options, like diet and exercise to control weight and sugar cravings. It is especially helpful to share this book with well meaning but clueless family and friends who advise fad diets as a quick fix."
1,Very preditable! Very boring! ( Spoiler alert! ),Boston Rob turned survivor into a very pretiable and boring show. The good thing is I know I don't have to see his face in the rest of the installment since he finally won after several participations.
4,The Bliss of Being!,"When I was 14 years old, I had what is called a ""spontaneous mystical experience,"" which put me in direct contact with the core of my being. I have never forgotten that experience, and what it taught me about who I truly am--that I am not my body, my mind, or even my personality . . . my essential essence is pure consciousness itself.Ever since that experience, I have tried to put it into words, and many authors have helped me do that. But this book describes the true essence of who we are in a manner more eloquent than any other. Thank you, Gangaji, for helping us discover ""the diamond in our pocket,"" and for showing us how that ""diamond"" is the only source of real peace and freedom.Steven Lane Taylor, author of Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow"
3,Good for beginners,"This was a book Amazon recommended to me. They probably recommended it because Eckhart Tolle wrote the Foreward and I bought some Eckhart Tolle books. Better than this book is Eckhart Tolle's book The New Earth. The Diamond in Your Packet keeps saying ""stop"" thinking. I understand it is our ego / thoughts / emotions that we have identified with that is keeping us from knowing who we really are. Eckhart Tolle explains it better. Also David Hawkins does a great job in his latest books - Transcending the Levels of Consciousness The Stairway to Enlightenment (which lays the ground work to the concept he is explaining) & his book Discovery of the Presence of God Devotional Non-Duality (a must read)."
2,Should have been much shorter,"Gleaning insight from this book is sort of like getting meat from eating a rattlesnake or very bony fish.It's there, but not much, and you have to do a lot of picking around unwanted stuff to get at it."
5,Gangaji knows her stuff!,"What convinced me to buy ""The Diamond in Your Pocket"" was the endorsement of Eckhart Tolle.Gangaji really knows her stuff. She says that continuing to play the story saps our energy. We must be willing to be conscious of it and experience the hopelessness and horror of being human. There is no escape! The willingness to be free is the willingness to be right here in the midst of it all. We must stop struggling to get out and just WAIT and SEE.""The Diamond in Your Pocket"" is an excellent self-realization book written from a female perspective. After reading it I was energized for days."
4,Thought Provoking - learn who you are,"A very special book. Probes self assessment in a way not familiar to most Christians. I am 30% thru the book and getting significant insights into who (I am).A good choice for anybody interesting in exploring basic questions such as, ""What do you want,"" and ""Who are you.""The book has short chapters suit able for reading one a day and then quiet consideration."
4,Emotional but some much more...,"I just wanna say that I love this album!If you like a more known act such as Anathema, you should check this out! Star Rover with The Loveless deliever something that you seldome hear. They play sad, dark and mellow. But they have that nerve, that there is something more beneath. If you like emotional and darkish, melodic music you should buy this album!!!"
4,Flour sifter,"This sifter is exactly what I wanted, excepting it is a little small. I wish it had told the cup measurement. But I still give it 4 stars."
1,"NOT worth buying, even at the cheap price",This video shows absolutely NO detail and barely skims the surface regarding each technique. Then it wastes a lot of time with a rambling interviewing of Jack Grout. This video definitely falls short of what it claims to do.
4,Let Jack teach you how to play golf his way.,"I picked up this book as a 15 year old kid and its the only form of golf lesson I have ever had. My handicap got down to 7 witin 5 years and then I stopped playing. Ive now started again and im going to read this book again and this time with Jacks help im sure I will get down to 2 or 3. Im not saying it will work for everyone, but, I cant think of many other people I would rather have teach me to play golf."
4,Mystery,"If you like medieval mysteries, this is for you. Sister Fidelma is a complex character with a surprisingly modern dilemma involving the conflict between family and work."
5,Badger's Moon,"In my opinion, this Sister Fidelma mystery was just plain scary. The reader begins the mystery in the mind of the murderer who is ready to kill and does so. It kept me guessing who the murderer was throughout the story. What I liked best was that the couple of Fidelma and Eadulf really worked together in an almost equal partnership this time, which was a breath of fresh air."
5,GREAT FLW Design type Table Clock,"If you like FLW design type items, you will like this very nice clock! The Willits Home glass inset design is set off nicely by a rich wooden frame and simple clock face. Thru Amazon.com, I was able to get it quite a bit cheaper than other websites. So far, it has been keeping good time, which is expected from a Bulova made clock."
4,Very Nice,"Very Nice looking, Review dimension. Clock a little small, but looks great. Very well made. Keeps time great and look good on the mantle."
2,small and orange,this clock is very small - check out the measurements very carefully before ordering. i bought it for a mantle clock but the overall clock was too small and the face was so small you couldn't read it from across the room. Also the wood is VERY orange.
5,nice clock!,Love this clock! Was looking for a clock to sit on my computer hutch. Fits the bill nicely altho it would REALLY be nice with a light source behind it so you could fully appreciate it's beauty. Very quiet and keeps great time.
5,Love the clock!,I needed a simple elegant table clock with no bells and whistles. Being a big fan of Frank Lloyd Wrigth I thought this clock would be perfect. This clock is lovely and I get many complements about it. It has worked flawlessly.
4,Beautiful clock,"Clock is very nice, perfect for our mantel. We have a craftsman house, so it works well for us."
4,enjoyable,"This DVD is often provided as a 'premium' during PBS donation drives. There are 5 National Parks that are highlighted. There is beautiful scenery shown, with a bit of a drawback that there are some of the same scenes repeated in short order. There are lots of scenes of the ensemble playing, perhaps more than of the Parks themselves. The music is very melodic, especially the sole wind instrument player who plays at times very haunting melodies, using flutes and related instruments.And yes, the smiling Tim Janis on the piano can wear a bit. But all the members of the ensemble seem to really be enjoying their efforts.In a bit of a surprise, the bonus music section perhaps contains some of the best pictures, especially if you like flower scenes. It perhaps is easy to miss this if you simply put in the DVD and push play."
1,Misleading Title & Description?,"When playing the dvd I expect to see our beautiful American sceneries instead of the orchestra playing. Why call it Beautiful America when there is hardly any sceneries? Our country have tons of them, more than any other countries in the world. We care about the music and the scenery but not the repeated images of the orchestra members."
3,Tim Janis,"Tim Janis's arrangement style is good but gets tedious as he comes and goes in musical waves so often that but after a while becomes annoying. I enjoy his emotional tone but please add happy and melodic themes. He should include more solo instruments like piano, flute or violin. Also bring more variety in your selections and delivery. There is so much to new age themes!! Remember Mantovani!!!"
4,four out of five stars,"Brav-o again, Mr. Benson. The plot was, to me, not quite as engaging as the last, Zero Minus Ten. However, the story telling was much smoother. It is obvious that Mr. Benson is becomming much more comfortable with his story telling. Keep it up, Mr. Benson!"
3,"Good fun, although still very average.","If you expect a Bond novel to be like a film (i.e. girls, gratuitous s.ex with all the girls and an implausible plot) then this is for you. Bond is investigating murders of soldiers on Cyprus, and the murder of M's lover - amongst others, and falls foul of a mysterious bunch of Greeks bumping off all and sundry in pursuit of ultimate perfection. It's sheer escapism stuff, but Bond now has a conscience - everytime he ends up in bed with a woman, he wonders why! Come on! And I thought it a bit much when Bond realises that this time he may not get out alive. I think any doubt like that would finish him off. Bond is, after all, a very cold-hearted killer. Bemused too by the list of acknowledgements - Benson seems to have been abosultely everywhere for research - I'm afraid it didn't come across in his writing that he'd been to any of them. Good fun, although still very average."
1,Bond's greatest foe revealed - his name is Raymond Benson,"I am shocked that anyone would give this novel more than one star. I am a lifelong James Bond fan and have read every Bond novel. The two written by Benson are easily the worst. I read this one because I refuse to give up on the Bond tradition but it was a painful read. Bond's dialogue is embarrassing, the story is underdeveloped, and the writing is amateurish. Did Bond really call an enemy ""Fathead"" in this book or was I just on the verge of falling asleep?"
4,"Better than High Time to Kill, TWINE","This book reads like the original Bond novels: sure, there are stunts and there are gadgets, but there is also a semi-believable plot, and good character development. Having read two of Benson's later Bond novels - High Time to Kill and the novelization of The World is Not Enough - I didn't expect much from this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. Benson's Bond is more human in this novel - he actually feels pain, and emotion - and the story and locations are much more interesting than in High Time to Kill."
3,"He's no Flemming, but then who is.","If you expect these books to be as good as Flemming's then you are going to be disappointed. If you are going to compare them to Flemming's then don't bother reading them. Because all you will do is have a rant about people giving them 5 stars. They are at least new Bond stories, have they been great? No I don't think so. But I don't think they have been garbage either. They share more with the movies than they do with the original books. They are light hearted action adventure, not a gritty spy thriller. If you like the Bond movies and are not going to be too critical then you will find these books a fair read. Although I didn't mind some of the Gardner books I don't think he captured either the movies or the books. At least Benson is trying when it comes to the Cars, gadets and guns. The sperm bank idea is a little odd in this book even for Bond. But I still enjoyed reading it."
3,"Mediocre yet, enjoyable.","This is the first James Bond novel I've read that is by Benson. The novel is amazing in some aspects and mediocre in others. The amazing part of this book is the plot. It moves quickly and has a the usual amount of twists and turns making it interesting enough to hold your focus. The mediocre part of this book is everything else. The writing style is horribly simplistic and overblown. A sixth grader with half an imagination could write better. The characters are characters and nothing more. Bond is forced to say double-entedres and the british slang term ""Bloody"" when he is mad. I know all this makes me sound like I did not like the book, but I did. This is one of those special books, It is so very cruddy but still enjoyable in light of it's cruddiness. I gave it a three because even though it was average, it held my attention through with the fine plot"
3,Close but no cigar,"Raymond Benson's second (third if you count the movie novelization) is a good attempt at melding the movie Bond with the Fleming Bond. This time Fleming's Bond gets lost in the shuffle. The main villain is leader of a ""cult"" so he tends to get lost also as he shares time with his henchmen/women. Felix is back, this time with a gimmicked-up wheelchair that provides one of the story's more ludicrous moments. But the high point and saving grace of this adventure are the 2 M's present and former. We see the new M in a vulnerable situation and are treated to a visit with Sir Miles at Quarterdeck. A word on canonicity-Benson pulls in Bondian memories which take in Fleming, Markham (Amis), and Gardner as 007 recalls past moments. This makes all previous Bond adventures ""real Bond"" if one accepts Benson as ""real Bond""."
2,Reads Like It Was Written For Sixth Graders,"While I originally welcomed John Gardner's departure from the Bond series, I'm growing increasingly annoyed with Benson's simplistic writing style. Even more so than Zero Minus Ten, this book reads more like a James Bond movie than one of Ian Fleming's classic novels. Benson claims to be a big James Bond fan, but except for a few gratuitous references to earlier Bond novels (from Fleming, Gardner, and Amis), Benson seems to have taken his Bond straight from the movie screen.Come along, Mr. Benson. Stop watching Bond movies and read Fleming's classic novels to find out what the character is REALLY all about."
1,Bad writing; bad story; just plain bad.,"Recently I observed a fifth-grader trying out instruments for the following year's school band. The band director, trying to get a sense of the kid's musical aptitude, sang a series of varied notes to the kid and asked him to sing them back. The poor kid sang back exactly the same, flat tone each time. Apparently he was truly tone deaf, unable to distinguish a C from an F sharp from a B flat.The people who are giving this book 5 stars are the literary equivalent of that kid. That anyone could put such a poorly written, unoriginal, and boring effort as this Benson story on the same level as any of the original Fleming books... well, I wouldn't have thought it possible. But then I didn't know anyone was as tone deaf as that kid.I don't have perfect pitch, but I can tell the difference between two notes an octave and half apart; and likewise, I can tell the difference between a 5-star story like ""Casino Royale"" and a .005-star story like ""The Facts of Death""."
5,Brilliant updating of 007!,"Raymond Benson has done a most engaging job of updating James Bond to the 90s and beyond. While the book feels like one of the films, it also feels like an original Fleming with the literary Bond's sensibilities. Benson takes the best of both worlds and combines them. Great plot, terrific characters... This is a must!"
3,It's not Fleming ...,"I liked this book better than the former one; Mr Benson is getting close to portraying Bond as a cold blooded, drunk, SOB. He is not there yet, I still get the feeling he is writing with a movie in mind.The story is good, and I like the references to past stories, and the book shows the author did his research.My grievances with the book is that the ending and some of the story is written specifically for a movie, the dialog is sometimes ludicrous, and the situations are not believable.It's not Fleming or Gardner, but Mr. Benson is getting better."
1,"If you like Fleming, give Benson a pass","How did Raymond Benson convince a publisher to print this garbage? This, in every sense, is a poorly written novel. The writing reminds me of a very earnest 10th-grader. This books' title character bears NO relationship to the James Bond created by Ian Fleming. I realize that the James Bond films have influnced millions of readers. Fine. That, however, is no excuse for a story that reads like a (bad) action-movie screenplay. Mr. Benson has created a poorly realized, Americanized Bond that has nothing in common with the original character.I could keep going, but the review only allows 1000 words. In short: This book is a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the James Bond franchise. Read Fleming. Or watch one of the movies, but don't waste your time on this book."
2,Ludicrous,"BENSON WRITES thrillers ""featuring Ian Fleming's James Bond"". Packed full of perfunctory sex and predictable violence, with an improbable plot, an absurd baddie and an obsession with brand names and hardware, this is an uninvolving confection that never manages to transcend the imaginative limits or warped authenticity of the original Bond films. Sporadic bursts of exciting narrative suggest that Benson should ditch the fossil and write his own books."
3,The language used,"The plot of the story is well set, but I felt the Benson is using Amercian English instead of British English for the words said by Bond. Take for example about the part when Bond was traped in the temple together with someone(I cannot remember his name),Benson could actully use the word ""fathead"" when Bond was trying to provoke his enemy!"
3,"OK, but not great.","If you like James Bond I suppose this is an OK book, but if you are looking for a good thriller, I'd take a pass on this. Try some of these instead: any of Bob Mayer's special forces series. Bob McGuire's THE LINE or THE GATE, or Joe Dalton's THE OMEGA MISSILE."
2,Same old story,"It was just ok. This book seems to follow a James Bond formula: two or three women, detailed explaination of the meal, fast car and typical end confrontation. The novel also lacks the rich description, and story development of Fleming novels."
2,Benson misses the point...,"In trying to copy Ian Fleming's writing style, Raymond Benson relegates himself to writing a pulp-novel of the late 1950s with technology of the 1990s. The results aren't great. What Benson has missed is that just as the Bond films of late have had to change with the times, so do the novels. Megolomaniacal bad guys may have been entertaining thirty-five years ago, but they've gotten pretty stale in the meantime (Ironically, the villain from ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", the latest film that was not scripted by Benson was much more contemporary and believable). As for biological weapons, that was done to death years ago. With competition like Tom Clancy and Stephen Hunter, Benson can't afford to be pretending it's 1962. The Bond novels always seemed more believable than the films, but try to imagine one of the movies featuring a scene in which Felix Leiter charges his electric wheelchair into the gunfire at a militia warehouse. I can't do it either."
3,"A mixed bag, but still worth reading","In many ways, this is the book Benson set out to write-a more ""fun"" read than Zero Minus Ten. I realize there is no one type of Bond novel, but it's still a little disconcerting seeing the cinematic Bond at times in a novel. The scene where Bond is in a social setting and women's eyes follow him is reminiscent of the early films. But later is a very brief, touching scene. Other events in the book follow the same pattern: something reminiscent of the films ending on a more novelistic note. Good points-Bond is involved with women in their mid-thirties. The story as a whole is well done. The story's climax should please fans of the Fleming books. Benson is to be admired in his efforts in bringing fans of the Bond films and books together. Even under Fleming's hand, the films' influence crept in the books OHMSS and YOLT. Benson's efforts will ensure that Fleming's legacy will continue."
5,The expression of color...,If you like photography but are wondering how relevant color photography (still) is? This is the book to return your emotions back on color. How serious color photography can be? Very...This is the book to open your heart to the way we are born to see the world.
4,Word By Word Picture Dictionary,"This is a very helpful and detailed cartoon-based `picture dictionary' for beginning ESL students. The numbers in the drawings correspond to the vocabulary below, which consists of the most common nouns, verbs, and popular expressions that people need to know in their everyday life. The 17 chapters cover everything from personal information and family to home, food, health, school, sports and even the US Constitution. Each unit is easily reproducible for various classroom activities as suggested by the authors. Unfortunately, at times the numbering is not exactly clear, as in the unit on highways and streets, and some of the pictures could be redone to better understand their specific meaning. How often do we see women driving big semi-trucks or men being secretaries? Might it not be wiser to show the ESL student the world as it is, rather than an idealized version of it? But, overall, this is a really good book for people who are starting to learn English."
5,Word by Word - amazing picture dictionary,"If you are starting to learn English - this is one of the best books you can buy for yourself. It has SO MANY topics that it covers almost all topics of everyday life. Unfortunately, there is no transcription so you have to buy the CDs. Other than that it is a great book. Topis include family, everyday activities and language, home, community, describing things, colors and clothing, numbers, money, time, food, shopping, community services, health, school and activities, work, transportation and travel, recreation and entertainment, nature, international travel and tourism. Each page has some exercises on the bottom to topic."
3,Was Not The Book I Thought I Ordered,"When I initially saw this book at the school where I tutor, I thought it was presented differently. Apparently I did not look at the book correctly, or I misundestood what I was ordering. Anyway, the book was perfect for what it was suppose to be, it was just not what I though I was ordering."
4,Word by Word Picture Dictionary: Vocabulary Game Cards,"These are a must for anyone who is learning a second language and needs to learn a lot of vocabulary. The cards only cover some of the sections of the dictionary and that is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.These cards are also an invaluable item for teachers who like to use a variety of materials, so their students will be excited about learning through the wonderfully illustrated and comical pics on each card. Classes will never be the same."
2,Too Cluttered,"This had great reviews, and I got it to help my adopted granddaughter learn English. She's 6 and from China. There was an overabundance of stuff on each page. It was hard to point to one item and say a word for it. A much simpler format would be better, I think. Went back to children's books. Disappointed."
3,Good Basic Vocab for the Adult English Learner,"Good for adult English learners working to integrate in the adult world, but it does not contain a lot of the vocabulary necessary for an English learner (elementry child) in the school setting."
4,Solid Speaker,"For years, I had been using a BOSE connected to my TV to get better-than-TV sound. I had the opportunity to upgrade to this speaker, so I took it.The product ships well; well packaged and easy to get out of the package. It is HEAVY, and little assembly is required. Note that it isn't TOO heavy, but heavy as in very solid.I expected a little bit of a ""plug and play"" system; to just disconnect my TV from the BOSE and connect to this speaker. However, these speakers require speaker WIRE; to connect, you have to wrap the wire around the contact. No big deal, but.... I haven't done that since I had 4' speakers in the eighties. (I haven't had a speaker like this either).Its a good, solid product and it looks good too -- all metal, no plastic. Slim, sleek design and the sound is good too. Recommended."
2,blaming others comes easy..,"I did not think this book was all that great. It is so easy to blame others for ones problems, i know this book is not true. at least the assaults on the sanderson gentlemen. I happen to know him when he was alive. This book is full of lies. Mr. Sanderson was allergic to milk. the stories of him drinking all the kids milk are lies. He couldn't drink milk. Mr. Sanderson was also accused of many other horrible things and it is curious how after he cannot defend himself he is accused."
5,GOOD READ,"It was hard to put down. I enjoyed, and recommend to anybody's collection. Wish there was a hard bound edition! Bet it will be movie someday !!!!!"
1,Nothing!,I ended up quitting using patches. These did nothing for me at all. I would not recommend these for quitting.
2,Uhh...,"Didnt work for me, but I ended up quitting with the e-cig. Ive havnt smoked a cig in over a month. The pills were cool stepping stone, but tasted like sugar pills.."
1,did nothing with me,it did nothing with me but may be can do something for others since you know guys our body resistance vary from one to other
2,It works...,"I will admit this product does work. Did I quit smoking, kind of. It made me cut back a little more each day. instead of smoking a pack a day I now smoke about half a pack. Sadly this product did not work out for me."
2,Didnt work for me.,"This product may work for some but it did not do much for me. Who knows why or why not, I am sure everyone is different."
1,Waste of $,"This product did NOTHING for me!!!! It was a waste of money. I will never buy this item again, but Ineed something to make me quit smoking"
4,Learn how to get true answers from Tarot,"This is an old video, but very honest, sincere and it is nothing like the new ""infomercials"" you see on TV with Miss so-and-so, that presents Tarot as a Gipsy tool or a myth and magic thing. No.Author explains the Major Arcana cards one by one, and two most popular spreads: YES/NO spread as well as Celtic Cross. She tells you how to store your tarot cards and how to ""energize"" them so they become truly ""yours"". She also does three ""live"" readings, she is very positive and knows her Tarot well. You can get the main idea about tarot and Celtic Cross watching this video.I did not give it five stars because it is too short for it's high price (about 60 minutes) but again, I am very happy I got it. It is like learning about Tarot from a live psychic reader, not just from books and Internet newsletters. it also comes with a miniature deck of Waite cards. Wow. And then, it is very honest. I guess, videos have been much more serious in 80's."
2,Missing Episodes,I purchased the Amazon Video Series for Flashpoint Season 3. I discovered the video download is missing the last four episodes of the season. A friend has the season 3 CD and she has 4 more episodes for the season than I received. I checked the season 4 download I purchased and the 4 missing episodes were not there. The show itslf is great. It would be better if I had all of the episodes to watch. Now I am afraid to order any other series on Amazom Video downloads because I do not know if I will receive all of the season's episodes.
3,Wonderful Show,"This show is absolutely one of the best shows that CBS had to offer after their cancellation of Numb3rs. CBS is stupid to cancel airing this show, thankfully Ion is picking it up. Hopefully they will at least still continue to sell the DVD's so I may continue to buy them.CBS not airing this anymore is probably one of the dumbest moves since ending Numb3rs. For this reason I refuse to watch anymore shows on CBS even if I also enjoy Criminal Minds, CSI NY and Blue Bloods. I will watch Criminal Minds with Flashpoint on ION.Also again CBS messed up the order of the episodes, as this is the end part of season 2 and the begining of Season 3 as CTV has made it."
1,Flashpoint: Third Season,"This DVD is a complete waste of money! Out of the 16 episodes on this DVD - 12 of them are on Season 2. When you go on the website of Flashpoint, all the titles that are for Season 3, only 4 of them are on this DVD. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone. If you want to purchase DVD's of Flashpoint I would highly recommend going to Chapters. Yes, you might pay a little bit more, but at least you get what you ordered."
5,Every episode is moving,"This is one of the best on T.V. Every episode is great with an emotional ending. It really makes you feel for victims, and quite often the people commiting the crime. I wish that it was part of the main stream though, there would be more episodes per season. The characters are real, and you really get to caring for these people. Basically an amaing show!!!"
1,Not Season 3,This was a bad buy. It isn't season 3. It is a combination of season 2 and 3 and the episodes aren't in order.
2,disappointed,"Apparently there is a difference between the ""Canadian"" and the ""American"" Season 3 of Flashpoint. I am from Canada. This is the American version. Which means . . . 1/2 of the episodes are on the Canadian Season 2. Very disappointed!"
1,Don't Buy This DVD!,"If you are a true fan of this show, which I definitely am!, don't buy this DVD. Buy the Canadian releases by Phase 4 films!"
1,crap box,"it is half of season two and half of season three lame lame lame. don""t buy it if you want what they are advertisingcause it is not season three. Buy it if you like being major league disapointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Flashpoint Television Series,Have been hooked on this Show since watching for the very first time. Drama just keeps getting better! The actors do a splendid job for each and every character; you really care about them. Hope this Show goes on and on and on.
1,Disappointed,I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I love the series and eagerly anticipated receiving the third season.When I received it I found too my dismay that season 3 contains episodes from season 2. And not the full list of season 3 episodes.
1,A Mash-up of Series 2 & part of Series 3,"What a disappointment! I've been an avid follower of this drama and have series 1 & 2. When I saw that Series 3 was available I immediately purchased it. I started to view the DVD & thought that I must have unwittingly imbibed some hallucinogenic potion prior to viewing. Talk about déjà vu! The 1st story titled ""One Wrong Move"" commenced and I thought ""I've already seen this!!?? WTF is going on?"". I then looked at the episode listings on Wikipedia & compared the episodes in Seasons 2 and 3 with what purports to be Season 3 on this DVD. It is, in fact, a mash-up of the episodes from the latter part of Season 2 with various episodes from part of Season 3 and not even in the sequence in which the episodes went to air. Briefly, this DVD is a complete dud and the ""Third Season"" labeling is an outrageous misrepresentation and is bound to be a bitter disappointment to those who have followed this series from its beginning."
1,Crap,Dont buy this so called third season of flashpoint it rlly isnt the 3rd season it rlly is just season 2 with the episodes .This is a hugeee SCAMMM dont bother find another way to buy it elsewhere
5,Love the show,"The show is great but not sure why on Amazon Prime all the shows we watch there is always one episode that is messed up, for instance Season 3 Epsiode 3 there is no sound. And I mean absolutely no sound what so ever, we rebooted and all other epsiode all play just fine."
3,"Show is great, Amazon is missing episodes","Four episodes from season 3 are missing from Instant Video. The Farm is listed, but is ""not available."" The following three episodes are completely missing: The Other Lane, Jumping at Shadows, and Acceptable Risk. Itunes has the complete seasons available for download."
2,Disappointing as most of the series was on Season 2 disc...,"We feel a little ripped off as only 5 episodes were new.We had bought a Season 2 Disc 2 locally in Australia months ago and on receiving Season 3 found that the majority of the episodes were on that Disc 2.So be careful when buying Season 3 if you also bought the separate Season 2 Disc 2.In saying that, the 5 new episodes were very good. This is a series we particularly enjoy: good development of key characters and some compelling story lines."
5,Good leather back pack for daily use.,"I ordered this for my husband and he is using it every day. He likes it a lot, it has room for many things and the descpription on the website about this product matches the real product. I definitely recommend this product to any professional people."
5,Bag of bags,"Looked all over for a bag that would answer all needs, and found only this one. Would not know what to buy if not for this bag - it's all business, yet comfortable to wear, with the option of tucking the shoulder straps away and going into that important meeting without looking back-pack-ee. The only reservation I had writing this review is that other people will start showing up with it - and I'd like to be the exclusive..."
2,shoulder strap edge torn from wear in less than a year.,"Very nice bag when new, but the edging on shoulder strap on one side wore through and became torn in only eight months. The problem, I've discovered, is with the design. The two shoulder straps originate in a zippered compartment, which means that when in use, the top part of each strap -- the part that bears all the weight -- can rub against the zipper ridges. Too bad. It's a good size if you need to carry heavy books with your computer, as I do. I'm looking for something else, because of the design flaw and durability issues."
2,Dimenions are off by over 50%,"My low rating was given to call attention to a significant error in the product description.The dimensions given on this and other web sites are significantly incorrect. The listing saysProduct Dimensions: 13.8 x 15.8 x 13.8 inchesIn fact it should sayProduct Dimensions: 13.8 x 15.8 x 6.0 inchesI was expecting a much roomier product, once that could be used for a several day trip. I was quite disappointed to have to scramble to find a suitable replacement. I settled on the ClaireChase Jumbo Laptop Bak-Pack but I have just ordered it and hope it arrives in time."
5,"Organized, efficient, a pocket for everything","It replaces a battered nylon backpack that was large and bulky. Everything that I used to carry fits with room to spare: PC/charger; iPad; phone/charger; notebooks; cables; earbuds; hot spot ""puck"". Great value, classy looks, feels and smells good."
3,poor...,"i rate it poor. not as bad as people say, but still bad.. the plots are unoriginal, voices are bad, cgi is not bad but not good too. just imagine two guys who live in supermen costumes all the time. when sleeping, in school etc. silly.show doesnt have anything else to mention. thats all show contains."
1,One of the worst cartoons ever!!,"Seriously, Fanboy and Chum-Chum had to be one of the worst cartoons of all time.Basically, the main characters are very annoying as heck, almost all of the other characters are unlikable and boring and the humor isn't much better.Anyhow, crap like Fanboy and Chum-Chum should be banned from TV period."
2,"Photographs are wonderful, the text disappointing.","I bought this book with great anticipation expecting a wonderful book on maritime photography. I am a fan of John Szarkowski and love his earlier work. While the choice of images is superb and the reproduction is wonderful, I was extremely disappointed by the text. Written by Richard Benson, it can only be characterized as bizarre, irrelavent and self indulgent. Opportunities to place the work in an historical or artistic context were often lost to flights of fantasy."
2,"It's ok, but not worth the money","I figured I'd buy this just for it's cool look and style. It's poorly painted and blades are less than 1/16 of an inch. poor design and construction. If you are looking for something more practical, buy something else."
2,My Experience,"This may look like a cool product and all but really this is not good for anythig but display. When i first got it on the same day, it broke apart. The area in which the sliding switch is, broke and caused the bar its on to come off and then the blade kept faling apart. Then the exact samething happened to the second one. This product should be labeled as not for combat or constant use. only for display. You should mine as well just order somethingelse."
2,1/2 and 1/2,Not the best piece. One of the blades was very solid the other shakes and is not very sturdy.
4,"Excellent Idea, wonderful drawings, unneeded and forced rhyming...","I work with kids and the book is well loved--the drawings are hillarious and the idea is truly fabulous, as many young children do go through at least a brief period of literal thinking where they aren't sure whether what they'd heard is indeed what they think they heard... However, I didn't find the rhyming to be nessecary and in some ways it detracted from the fun. The children certainly didn't listen to it and were far more focused (as well they should've been...) on the funny funny drawings and the wonderful concept of the boy making so many misinterpretations of the adults' speech around him and toward him.Lovely book overal.Recommended."
5,Another great book,"Received the recommendation from a friend... this is another one of a series of really great books for young kids. Especially boys, but girls will enjoy them too."
4,Funny book that kids enjoy,"Children love this type of humor. Some overprotective adults might not see the humor in this book, but every child that I've read this book to enjoyed it. I've never know any child to be afraid of this book. Kids are able to see the humor easily."
5,Wisdom of the Ancients,"I collected several of Lobsang Rampa's books back in the seventies. After rereading them I wanted to add to my collection. The books I ordered from Amazon were to fill in the collection. They were exactly as I expected except for ""Entering the Hall of Records which is over-sized and does not fit my bookshelf. They all arrived in good condition and in a timely manner."
2,Not compatible with iPAQ 3835,I just received the product and found that the cable is not compatible with my iPAQ 3835. Amazon.com shows this product under accessories for the 3835 but it does not work.
2,Tubes not up to par,I bought this book for my five year old granddaughter who was preparing to go into the hospital - even she found it boring. Would NOT recommend.
5,Absolutely a must have if your young child is getting tubes!,My son is 2 and 1/2 and this book was fabulous in preparing him...from the descriptions of what Luke is feeling to the illustrations of how the doctors and nurses are dressed in the operating room it is fabulous!I definitely recommend it! And of course in my case the multicultrual cast of characters was an extra bonus!
4,Good choice,"This book has been helpful in preparing my daughter for her surgery. She just turned 5 and she asks to be read the book frequently and sometimes ""reads"" it to her stuffed animals. I could recommend getting this book to prepare your child for ear tubes + adnoidectomy."
4,Great Rock Concert,"Positive Things:This dvd ROCKS. The setlist is good. Of course a few more tracks wouldn't hurt, but in the end a good mix of new songs and old hits.Its a very intense and high energy concert all the way through.Especially drummer Greg Upchurch is stunning with a hard-hitting super performance.The video is great shot and awesome quality, only to be topped by the sound. All instruments are so clear and loud.Negative Things:The song ""Drift and Die"" features a guest guitarist with a long solo thing and it just ruins the song for me. Too bad.Some will find the acoustic set great. But I like the electric versions better.Conclusion: If you like rock and/or POM this dvd won't dissappoint you."
1,"Striking that familiar chord, indeed","Puddle of Mudd have released two albums that were full of soft verses and hard choruses, now they make an acoustic set. Does anyone remember ""Unplugged"" by Alice In Chains? Whoever says Godsmack has made a good living by ripping off AIC obviously hasn't heard of Puddle of Mudd."
5,Packed Full of Polke,"This is by far the best compilation of Sigmar Polke's images I have come across. This book is FULL of his images, all in extrodinary quality. This is highly recomended for any artist's library. Amazing."
5,A Great Challenge,Everyone should see this presentation. Brian Steidle brings to the attention of everyone the travesty occurring in Darfur.
2,The DVD is about as bad as the book,"1. Most will think that I'm biased since I gave a pretty harsh review of the book. But with the faint hope that the DVD would redeem my disappointment with the book--> I realized that I had to check out the DVD.2. Bottomline: If you liked the book, you'll probably like this DVD and vise versa. I gave it a 2 star because it still has educational content."
5,A striking addition to any film library strong in African history and society.,"The 2007 world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, THE DEVIL CAME ON HORSEBACK offers up an analysis and expose of the genocide in Darfur as seen through the eyes of a former U.S. Marine Captain who served as an unarmed military observer with the African Union. His photos and first-hand observations provides a wild ride into the heart of Darfur society, politics, and social issues and will prove a striking addition to any film library strong in African history and society."
4,"Nice unit, works well but with a minor complaint","I did not have a brown outage or lightning interference yet. However I had all my equipment plugged in and turned on when I unplugged the power cable from the wall, I could not see a single glitch, everything worked as if nothing had happened. I also turned off the power in my house and I got the same results. The only draw back of this unit is the amplifier that is built inside it. I did notice that I hear radio interference coming from my 7.1 surround sound system when I crank the volume all the way, and I hear less interference when I am not using this unit. (this only occurs when I blast my 1000 watt sound system). Overall, I am happy with this unit."
1,Battery was DOA,"I charged the unit overnight as indicated in the manual. After charging I ran the self-test and instantly got a ""Replace Battery"" indicator. The unit functioned (other than battery back-up). Belkin is sending a replacement, however, I am stuck paying the shipping on the defective unit.What a great day and age we live in where I can purchase a defective product and I have to pay to send it back..."
1,Not worth it!,"WOW! What an experience. I received the item DOA. In looking at other posts, I decided to let it charge up plugged in over a 72 hour period. No dice, it still didn't work. Called Ritz for an RMA to send it back, waited 2 weeks and still no RMA label. Called them again and finally got an RMA to send the unit back for replacement. Just called today and they won't be replacing it, they will be refunding it! That would have been nice to know 2 weeks ago when I sent it back. I won't be buying anything from Ritz anymore."
5,The Real Deal,"This stuff is great on everything from eggs to burgers to BBQ anything. It has wonderful smokey flavor, and as the label says it's fairly hot(for true chile heads It's pretty mild). This is the real deal Chipotle flavor from south of the border, the only problem is $12.99 for a 5.8 oz. bottle??? Must be a type-o or something, PEOPLE YOU CAN BUY THIS PRODUCT DOWN AT YOUR LOCAL MEGA-MART FOR $1.69! Yes that's what I said $1.69.Buyer Beware"
2,Briwax,I have used this paste wax many times before and it should be a heavy paste like consistency. This time it came to me almost in a liquid. To my knowledge the only reason it liquifies is if it has been exposed to heat. I don't think it was a problem with the product itself but rather how it had been stored prior to shipment or that it had been exposed to heat during shipment.
2,i didnt see any change,"i got weaker instead of gaining strenght and puting on weight. I stopped using it. I will try another blood tonic.sorry,it didwork for me."
3,"""Dead Eyes"" is Dead On","Put your feet up and enjoy this one like you would an old TV detective thriller because it has it all; murder, mystery, and suspense. It has a female in distress and a Hollywood detective and a friend to try and save her; what more could you as for. Oh yeah; it has a surprize ending with no commercials. Stuart Woods as always is a good read."
2,Disappointed But Not Ready to Give Up,"(...) unfortunately I started with Dead Eyes. I felt as though I was reading a suspense story from a beginner romance novelist. The dialogue at times was laughable and I agree with another reviewer that the ending was thrown together. The few sex scenes were like something from Barbara Cartland. My biggest complaint was the portrayal of the cop Jon Larsen - he came off as an incompetent dolt. Through the entire book, the stalker was one step ahead of him to the very end. However, this writer gets such high praise from other reviewers that I'm not quite ready to quit and plan on checking out the Stone Barrington series."
3,I liked it.....,"Not his best work, but I've read much worse. I wasn't offended or anything. I didn't feel it was exactly ""American Psycho"". Well aware this novel though was a quick $buck$, and not much more."
3,"Enjoyable, but very curt ending","I really enjoyed the book...quite the page turner, but I felt unsatisfied with the ending. There was zero explanation as to ""why"". It reminded me a bit of what Patricia Cornwell will do. It's as though she (and Woods) realizes that she needs to wrap up the story & does so quickly, without much explanation as to why the killer was who the killer was. I realize a lot of times there aren't reasons for killings, but in a book, for $..., there could be a reason or two explained! It was a good read, not as good as ""The Run"" (the first I read), but enough to have me reading more of his books."
3,Hacked off.,"Stuart Woods must suffer from multiple personality disorder: brilliant author/hack writer. ""Dead Eyes"" is a fall from grace from the author of the great ""Chiefs."" A run-of-the-mill stalker thriller. In fairness, the prose is lean and gets straight to the point."
3,Not his best,"I am a Stuart Woods fan, but this fell short of his usual charm. Tried to tie up too many loose ends from other novels."
3,Great book for a general overview of Canada,"National Geographic Traveler's Canada gives a great broad look at Canada's cities and their highlights. As with any National Geographic series book, its full with rich pictures of the various sights. Included are good driving destinations for scenic tours. However, this book is definitely not the be-all and end-all of Canadian Travel. It does not give a detailed look at any of the cities, and should be really only used as a starter for more research into what you plan on doing and where. But then again, how can anyone expect a concise travel guide on such a large country in only 400 pages?"
1,wilton food writers,I made cake pops and dipped them in Wilton candy. When they were completely dry I tried to decorate them. These marker will not write on wilton candy.
1,Not meant for candy melts,"I, too, wish I had read these reviews before purchasing these in a local craft shop. Only about 10% of what I wanted to write on my conversation heart cake pops even showed up. I would have been better off scratching the message in with a safety pin! I even tried refrigerating and freezing the cake pops, to see if a harder / dryer surface would help. NOPE. These may work on fondant or other surfaces, but the do NOT work on candy melt coating!"
1,Disappointing to say the least,"I would have to agree with the other negative reviews as well. Like a couple others, I got these to use on my cake pops after getting Bakerella's book. I made the popcorn bags and sat down to make them all cute, got the first ""P"" written, and that was that - the pens could take no more. I too, tried wiping them off, and tried other pens in the set to no avail. I guess I can try them on the next fondant cake I make, but for candy melts, they just plain don't work. I will be getting the Americolor set next, and cross my fingers that they will work; I have cuteness to make!"
2,Don't write smoothly- Wilton should be ashamed,"I agree with the other negative reviews. The fine tip is not a fine tip, but a small point on a stubby magic marker. I had a heck of a time getting the color to come out at first, and then the color goes on like an old felt-tip pen- little pieces of fabric-y ""color"" getting deposited along the path, and a line that looked more like a faded dash.I tried to write on cheese, a pretty smooth surface, but the pen still dragged, picking and choosing when to leave color or pieces of the marker, or picking up flakes of cheese itself, making for a huge mess. Wilton should be ashamed to have their name on this product.If I could, I would return these to the craft store where I purchased them. They're going straight in the trash- I'll buy another brand."
3,Meh. Buy Betty Crocker or Americolor,"I bought these for writing on foods other than icing and fondant. They are next to useless on cheese. Okay-ish on hard-boiled eggs and peeled oranges. Terrible on bread. I hear good things about theB.C.EASY WRITER FOOD DECOR.andAmericolor Food Marker Writers- 10 Color Packfrom people who draw on other foods like I do who have used one or both of those, plus these ones. I will be buying those next."
2,Not so edible markers,"I bought these markers looking for an edible treat but it turns out the plastic on these things isn't really chewy and degrades in my mouth faster than the traditional mechanical pencils I am used to. Getting to the ink core was a nice surprise, but more or less flavorless. If you are looking for a writing utensil that actually has flavor look elsewhere. They say these are edible but that doesn't mean they taste good."
2,Better pens exist,"I was ready to throw the set out after one use and wish I had not wasted my money on this particular Wilton product. I highly suggest that you put the money toward another brand such as KopyKake pens or Americolor. The Wilton tips are too thick, yes including those labeled ""fine tip"", and although sufficient to fill in colors or make thick lines, you will be disappointed using on any design that calls for a thin line. If it were the only one of it's type out there, that would be a different story but it isn't."
1,Not worth it,"I bought these markers thinking it would make it easier to ""paint"" on my son's birthday cake.I don't know if the markers were dried out, or if they are just a horrible product. I attempted to write on chocolate and fondant, and it was a streaky, chunky mess. The tips of the markers balled up and then simply would not work. I ended up buying Wiltons frosting colors and just used a small brush to paint on detail."
1,Wilson Food Writer Edible Color Markers are NOT for melted chocolate,"I, too, bought these markers so that I could draw on faces on my cake pops - dipped in the Wilson melting chocolate. I got 2 eyeballs on a smiley face and a third of a grin before the black stopped working. No amount on wiping on a clean paper towel would allow me to finish the face. Seriously disappointed in the experience. It should have a note that you cannot use it with the chocolates. For example, on the melting chocolates Wilson tells you which kind of coloring you can add to white. The packaging for the markers has no information as for which uses they are meant."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this set to decorate cake pops. I only needed the black but could not find individual markers in the store. I wish I had not wasted my money on these markers. I had barely started drawing on one cake pop and the marker stopped working. Very bad quality. I'd heard several bad reviews regarding different Wilton products. I will be avoiding Wilton products from now on. There goes $8.99 + tax down the toilet...
1,Awful product,"I got these to add some detail to my son't R2D2 birthday cake and was hardly able to do anything. I was writing on fondant and the pens would barely write on it. The black gave out after one small rectangle and the red after a small red circle. I bought mine at Michael's and they wouldn't return it, they apparently don't stand by the products they sell, not sure about Amazon, but my advice it stay away from these markers."
2,nice try wilton,"even after reading the negative reviews, i went ahead and bought these pens. i figured since i was using fondant instead of chocolate/candy melts it would be fine. unfortunately, no. the pens do not draw smoothly and they dry out quickly. they might be good for bento decorations or sugar cookies with hard icing though."
2,Skip This.,"I hate to write negative reviews. Hopefully though someone else will save money on my mistakes.I dipped mini marshmallows in yellow chocolate to make little lego heads for a lego party. I needed something to write the faces with on the chocolate.These are not expensive and you can buy them just about anywhere. It took me a very long time to write faces on the chocolate. The black marker was black and it worked but it worked slowly. I had to keep marking on a piece of paper in order to keep it working on the chocolate.I haven't tried others so I can't direct you to any other types of food markers. But my guess is that there are others out there that do a better job. If you had a small job these would be fine. If you had to write a lot, it will not do a good job. It certainly won't live up to the picture on the cover of the box. This shows a pen making a pretty butterfly in one long swoopy line. That is simply not going to happen with these."
2,Didn't do what I needed them to.,"These food markers may be good for writing on some food surfaces. I needed them to write on white chocolate covered marshmallows. They did not work at all. No matter how much or how little pressure I applied, they simply scratched the coating, but didn't write. They wrote on the paper towel I wiped them off with, but I could write on paper with a Sharpie. I tried holding the marker straight up and down, and at several different angles. It simply did not work. I ended up using icing and a lettering tip."
1,Should've listened to the other reviewers,"I've read so many bad reviews regarding this product but decided to give it a try since this is the set that available in our local store. Used it to draw jack o'lantern on popcakes, took me 15 minutes to finish 4 of them with lot's of scribbling on papper, was hoping it would help the ink to come out. The pen tip was 'scrapping' the candy melt and the ink just won't come out. Next time I'll just buy edible paints and use brush like another reviewer said."
1,disappointed,I just finished decorating a couple of dozen cookies for Thanksgiving.These wre like using a dried up magic marker .Never again.
3,Does not write on chocolate,"I purchased this item, thinking I could use the pens to create conversation hearts by writing on heart-shaped cake pops. The pens do not write on the chocolate. Might be the fat content in the chocolate. Now I have to find another use for these! Oh, well."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I am making Hello Kitty cake pops for my daughters' birthday and purchased these edible markers. Specifically for the black one. It doesn't show up at all! If anything, it roughs up the surface of the white coating but it doesn't appear black. Complete waste of money!"
1,Doesn't work on candy melt!,"I bought these pens to use on cake pops but they don't work on candy melt. The only way I could make any mark at all on the cake pop was to keep drawing on one spot over and over again as if I were coloring 1 small line. And even then, the mark it made looked like a pen that was running out of ink. But, these pens did work nicely on M&M;'s.If you want edible markers that will work on candy melt, avoid these!!"
2,Should have read the reviews first...,"Like many others, I purchased these at a local store to decorate melting wafers/melting chocolate. I had a perfectly smooth cake pop and the pens would not write at all on the surface. Looking back at the package, it does not say it will work on melting wafers. It just says, ""Perfect for cookies, cakes and more!"" And lists things like cheese and frosting as other foods to write on. If I would have read the reviews online, I would not have purchased the Wilton brand. I have since ordered Americolor pens and I am looking forward to trying those out.I didn't rate these Wilton pens at 1 star because they probably work on other foods, but they did not meet my needs at all."
1,Useless for cake pops!,I only gave these 1star because I couldn't give it a zero! What a waste of money! Wilton should have labeled these markers with the products they work with. So far the only thing I've seen them write on is paper! They will not mark on candy melt surfaces at all!
3,lots of things in ur bag?,i love puma bags! but when i ordered this itrem i thought it would be a bit bigger. when i recieved it i wasnt so happy but now that ive used it i guess its safe to say that for its size it hold many things. i would recommend this bag to anybody that carries loads of things in their bags.
2,Good Lord!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Normally, I can handle habanero peppers. This damn near killed me off. I think this hot sauce should be renamed ""Attempted Murder""."
3,GREAT for the $ that I paid on Black Friday 04',"Ok so I've had this vacuum for 4 years. I kept up with the filters and belts, but the motor just died on me. I got it new for $40 at a Walmart. I didn't come with the long attachment that I like. The main suction was good enough, but there wasn't good suction on the sides like some vacuums have. There ya go."
4,tactical reality,"This is a very good manual on firearms training. It is a book intended for those interested more than just punching holes in paper targetes, it is for real world martial artists who understand the importance and reality of winning lethal force encounters. I highly recommend this book."
2,lacks detail,"The author seems very knowledgable and identifies quite a number of training problems. But he offers very little detail about how specifically to resolve the problems. My money was much better spent on books such as: Tactical Pistol by Gabriel Suarez, In The Gravest Extreme by Massad Ayoob, Street Smarts by Jim Grover, Combat Handgunnery by Chuck Taylor, Stopping Power by Evan Marshall, and Stressfire Vol 1 by Massad Ayoob."
2,Not so good,"The manual has no basic instructions. The recycling time is 8 SECONDS... way too slow!!! I am upgrading to the Nikon SB-600 or maybe SB-800 (if I get another wedding soon!). Anyway, don't waste the dough on this, you will want to upgrade soon after buying it."
5,Fantastic Table - especially for the price!!,"Great table- sturdy and looks good. Only complaint is that since it has gaps between the slates on top, my guests spill some of their drinks that are smaller - like champagne glasses!"
3,"Nice table, poor welds","I love the look of this table and am mostly pleased with the purchase. Assembly was difficult and FRUSTRATING, however, because the welded portions of the legs that were supposed to receive the cross bars were bent in three of the six places where they were supposed to connect. My only option was to take a hammer to the welds and try to open them up wide enough to receive the support pieces. This, of course, caused the paint to chip away from these areas. Not visible after assembly...but you shouldn't have to take a hammer to brand new furniture just to get it to fit together! I was not able to open up one of the welds enough to get the support to fit snugly in the leg. The screw was long enough to bridge the gap and hold it securely (I hope) but it's annoying to have these kind of problems with a brand new item."
3,Missing Hardware Pack,"Recieved 1st Table but was missing the hardware pack. Called amazon, they gave me an e-mail address to get a new hardware pack but that e-mail address did not work. Had to call them back again and explain the situation to another customer service rep, then they tried the address and found it was bad. So they had to send a whole new table. We're talking about 12 bolts, and they had to send a whole new table! what a waste of freight dollars to replace a small hardware pack. Overall the table looks nice and it was easy to put together, however nothing frustrates me more than not having enough screws or no screws to assemble somthing. From previous reviews this is not uncommon, so if you do buy this don't be surprised that you may have to order another one."
1,Quality is an issue,"Ordered this set based on earlier reviews. For a set of cookware that lists for over $550, cuisinart should be ashamed. Right out of the package there were issues - the lid on one of the pots did not fit because the rim was not round enough, and fit very loosely on another, despite the claim of snugly fitting lids. The lid for the steaming insert is useless, since the pot that the insert goes into already has a lid! Some peole might like light pans, but these have a junky feel. I'll use them for a while, but this set is probabaly going back..."
4,cookwear,Cook even but the handles get hot and they scratch easily on the outside and have to be washed with sponge only. They look great! Compared to other cookware that we've used these are the best for cooking but need to be stored individually to prevent damaging.
5,"Excellent quality, superior value for the cost","I did a lot of research looking for a high quality, but affordable cookware set. This set certainly satisfied me. I like the appearance, the weight (feels solid but not too heavy). The pots heat very fast and very even. I let the pans completely cool before washing and it's a still a breeze, the nonstick surface works great.I think if you following the manufacturer's care instructions, you'll be satisfied with this set for a long time."
1,Not all the pieces were there!,"I ordered this item December 3, 2010 and it arrived December 10. Only 12 pieces were in the box! I am missing the 3 quart sauce pan and lid. I called GOURMET KITCHEN GALLERY twice and have not heard back from them. In addition, they only have voice mail, so it does not sound very professional. I am very upset as I need this cookware for holiday cooking and was very upset that I ordered 14 pieces and only 12 came. This is very poor quality control and very poor customer service."
1,Cannot be used for induction cooktop!!!,"When you perform a google search for induction pots and pans the Cuisinart 66-14 shows up at the top of the list. Yet, these cannot be used for induction cooktops. None of the literature states these pots and pans cannot be used for induction purposes. Beware, Cuisinart will not allow you to exchange this item for credit or induction cookware. Fortunately, Amazon is more consumer oriented and issied a full refund."
1,DON'T BUY FROM CUSINART,"I thought HARD anodized would be HARD! It claims to be metal utensil and dishwasher safe yet I only used wood and washed them by hand and STILL the ""coating"" inside flaked off and Cuisinart was unwilling to work with me unless *I* paid to have the pans shipped to THEM where THEY would decide if I abused them ??? (they were 2 weeks old) and then I was expected to pay to have them shipped back to me.Oh NO NO NO Find ANOTHER brand and buy different cookware! This is not the Cuisinart from years gone by, their customer service is abysmal! RUN RUN RUN!"
3,Great for the price,"I thought this set was absolutely great until I learned that teflon is being phased out. Get orgreenics or similar.By-the-way my eggs stick in these pans and yes, with oil. But they seem very durable and hopefully will not start seasoning my food with teflon flakes like so many other pans i've owned."
3,"Love the Pans, Hate the Finish","These pans are heavy duty and heat very easily and cook evenly. The variety of sizes is great. The part I don't like about these is that if you put them in the dishwasher, the exterior gets chalky and a gray 'dust' comes off on your hands when you touch it. It covered a paper towel I used to try and wipe it off.If I had known that I couldn't put them in the dishwasher I would NEVER have gotten them. Buyer Beware."
5,Don't use metal utensils,"I received my set yesterday. The hubby used a metal spatula, and now there are little scuff marks one of my beautiful new pans.I'll write an update in a while."
5,Cuisinart Hard Anodized Cookware,"This cookware is wonderful. They are very lightweight, even though they look like they would be heavy. The surface is very easy to keep clean and even when using high heat they remain new looking and the cook surface is unpitted. The only negative comment is that each pot with a lid has a different size lid than the next pot, so I have alot of glass lids that take up space."
5,LEE2,The item was in PERFECT shape. I received it in a timely manner. It was a fantastic buy and definitely serves its purpose.
4,Compra super excelente...,"Make this purchase since I have very good references from Cuisinart products, pots came wrapped in excellent condition, very protected, I have not used all but I have used are great, the food does not stick the cooking is uniform, which surprised me a lot are the handles do not heat up at all, the glass covers are very good and you can see what you cook, the quality of the pots are unbeatable, I'm very happy with this purchase and now I love to cook more. just .. do not hesitate to make this purchase."
4,Satisfied!,"The product came in a big box altogether. Packaging was ok. The cover lids are not that tight when you cover them in the pans. But doesnt bother me at all. The only downside is, the cover lids top handle gets hot too. Compared to my Tools of the Trade cookware i had before which i dont have to use any potholders. But overall im satisfied with these item. Glad i bought them."
3,"Cooking is great, appearance is not...","I bought this set over a year ago, desperate for some decent pots and pans. I have been very impressed with cooking performance and they do clean up easily. Non-stick coating has given me no issues, still like new. HOWEVER, I am extremely dissappointed in the outer finish. It lookes HORRIBLE even though I always hand wash them as recommended. I was planning to hang my pots and pans on a rack, but these aren't something I'd want on display. I will probably go with the Cuisinart Pro Stainless next time."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"After 3 uses, following ALL instructions Food STICKS. Eggs, meat, vegetables and don't even get me started on pancakes. Stay away from this cookware set"
3,Quality questionable.,The metal components are great however the lids shatter for no apparent reason. I no longer use the lids during cooking. An internet search revealed a history of problems with the lids' quality. I would expect a better product for the money spent buying these items.
5,Seem Good,"Got this set for my wife and she seems to love them. I must admit, they are really non-stick as most of the time you don't need to put any oil in them. Eggs, for example, slide right off! They seem like a quality set."
3,Missing some substance but still good,"Not a great book but still a good read. All of the town's female characters, even the police seem to very easy women which makes this book pretty unrealistic. It seems like the author must be a teenager who has never had a girlfriend, even though as we know he is not. If you can accept the constant sleaze and sluttiness of the characters this is a pretty simple fast read book.A young couple, Bass and Faye out for a canoe picnic come across a naked decapitated female corpse with the killer running off across the river carrying the woman's head when he sees them. Once back in the town Faye disappears and it becomes apparent someone is out to kill Bass before he can identify him to the police.Among the Missing is no literary masterpiece but it is enjoyable enough to read if you can get it cheap and it will pass the time nicely."
1,Reads easily but has very little substance,"The only thing missing from Richard Laymon's ""Among the Missing"" is an Epilogue. Had it contained one, this novel would have been very much like an extremely low budget episode of Barnaby Jones.It's somewhat mislabeled a ""horror"" novel. It really should be classified as a murder/mystery. The back cover blurb sets up the tale well enough. The story goes something like this: Late night liaison, murder, decapitation, witnesses, police involvement, suspects, twist, resolution. To go into details of any one of these aspects would be to ruin what story there is. This wouldn't be fair to the reader.To his credit, Mr. Laymon has a knack for writing very light prose. This novel can be finished in just under two hours. If you're looking for something simple and not very taxing, this is a novel that certainly fits the bill.It will definitely entertain all of Laymon's fans, but if you're new to his work, this wouldn't be the best to use as a starting point."
3,One of Laymon's gotta meet a deadline novels...,"Not every Laymon book can be a 4 or 5-star review, unfortunately. This is not to say this isn't a good novel, just not a top shelf Laymon release.The plot is typical Laymon; a slasher is on the loose, lots of high-speed activity and violence, sexy helpless women, etc. As stated, not a great one, but certainly an enjoyable read on a dark and stormy night.Characters aren't prototype Laymon, ie sympathy towards them. But don't fear, Laymon is better than 75 percent of horror writers out there being published. The ending is a very good one!"
3,Laymon Rocks,"I read alot of different horror writers, but Laymon has always been my favorite. It's not his best book, but it is still a good read. If you've never read Laymon before and want to cut your teeth on a great book I recommend Bite, but if your a long time fan Amoung The Missing isn't to be overlooked."
4,A mystery with gore.,"Richard Laymon is a master storyteller. He has written some excellent supernatural horror novels. This book is classified as a horror novel because that is what Richard Laymon normally writes, but it reads more like a mystery than a horror novel. I enjoy mysteries, so I enjoyed this book. It contains more gore than most books in the mystery genre, but less horror than most books in the horror genre. This is not Richard Laymon's best book, but a good storyteller is always fun to read."
4,My first Laymon,"This was my first Laymon novel, and I loved it. It got me hooked on this writer, who is now my favorite horror novelist. This is a great introduction to Laymon. It's probably not his best book, and it was somewhat predictable, but it was still a fast-paced and fun read. I was left with a couple of questions at the end...but it didn't bother me so much."
1,One Word: Ugh!,I couldn't get past chapter six before putting this piece of junk down. The author must be completely oversexed because it comes through his writing. Either that or he doesn't have much respect for women. Every female character acts like a brainless bimbo and bares their chest and the men ogle them. Even the responding officer makes a comment about how sexy the dead decapitated murder victim was. So disgusting. The responding officer made every mistake known to man when being the first officer on a murder scene. I only spent .33 cents on this book due to it being sold at a used book sale. It was .33 cents more than I should have paid for it.
3,"Good plot, silly nudity","The plot was excellent. But the writing seemed very teenage-boyish with lots of ridiculous nudity, right down to a silly scene at the end where the naked, handcuffed female cop manages to tackle and disable a villain. The nudity added a childish dimension to the novel that made the novel seem like a young adult novel. Great plot though, and interesting villain(s)."
4,Another FIne Laymon Title,"Richard Laymon is one of the most versatile horror writers of our time. As such, his books follow may different styles. This is one that is a little more different than most.At the heart of this story is a murder involving a headless body. Thus this book is part a murder mystery while also being a gruesome and chilling look at how inhuman some human-seeming people can be.If you are looking for another BEAST HOUSE, this will not fit the need, but if you are looking for a Laymon-style glimpse of evil and depravity, this is a title for you.It is sometimes hard to give details about a Laymon novel without giving away something best left to the reader's discovery and this book is no exception."
4,Detailed Human Physiology,This is a very detailed book on human physiology. For medical practitioners. General topics are as follows: 1. General Processes 2. Digestion 3. Circulation 4. Blood and Lymph 5. Renal Function 6. Respiration 7. Humoral Control 8. Sensation 9. Neural Control
5,Love this product,"I don't know why this steamer got such a bad review. I can only say the best things about it. If people would read the user manual first they would not complain about certain things, like ""there is water shooting out the first 10 seconds"" because that is something that you are told. The attachments are very useful. It is not a hassle to use. You still need some arm grease to get rid of heavy dirt - but that is normal. I love the fact that I don't have to use any household chemicals to sanitize my house. It only smells fresh - without chemistry. One tip for other people buying it: Don't keep the part where the steam comes out on a lower or same level as water tank. That could cause water instead of steam coming out of the nozzle. This is just common sense (water always flows to the lowest point - right?).I absolutely love it."
1,Great for wrinkles in clothes,"I have yet to find anything that this will clean better, faster or easier than any liquid cleaner. I have tried on oven grime, barbeque grime and cooked-on cooking residue on cookie sheets. Tried on plastic, ice chest, nope, did not do very well. It did remove wrinkles for clothes, leaving very little residue. Whatever they are cleaning on TV is not the same dirt in the average household."
2,steam mouse needs help,"i ordered this steam mouse from a tv program (no name needed) it arrived and had trouble with this product approx 6mos after purchase. the steam cap value would not come off to add water. i called the company and they told me that they had problems with that happening since i purchased mine and i could order a new steam value. well, i got the new one and it will not screw down all the way for steam to even come out the handle now. i am ordering another brand this time...one with a on and off switch so i can control the steam this time...this one doesnt let you do it...."
2,Not recommended by me,"I bought this product with all the expectations of this productworking as seen on TV. Well, it does clean with hot steam w/oany artificial chemical. But the product I received, the capwould not lock easily. Actually only my husband could make itlock in one out of 10 times, it's that difficult. Themanufacturer's said not to use the product unless the cap isproperly locked, but it takes more that half an hour to makethe cap lock, if you are lucky to be able to lock it, at all.I donot know if the product I received was defective or ifthat's how the product is designed, hopefully not. Also, thewater finished within 15-20mins. The onetime we could make itlock, we couldnot even finish cleaning the shower glass's, bythe time the water finished. I'm returning the product back."
4,Steam Mouse,"I bought this because a very good friend of mine who also has disability issues especially with cleaning my apartment on my own. It's hard for me to clean a 1 bedroom apartment since I severely injured my back installing a computer network, have had both hips replaced and am facing another back surgery. This makes cleaning alot easier for me. I can't get on my knees to scrub anything and I have to take breaks about every 15 minutes or so and I think this steamer is a blessing for those of us who have mobility problems.I bought it direct from the company because I couldn't find it anywhere else. My friend bought it after seeing a TV video and it was called the Steam Mouse. So between this thing and my Scuba and Roomba, I can still live independently and not have to pay for a cleaning service.People with disabilies want to live independently and products like this are very helpful."
1,How do you get the water reservoir open?,I bought the steam mouse several years ago. It worked alright but not great. I didn't use it for a while and now I can't open it up to add water. It's like a vaccum has formed. Anyone else have this problem??
2,Do Not Recommend,"The main reason why I would not recommend this product is because of the company. I called them before I decided to purchase. I bought the product based on the lies I was told by their customer service person. It was quite obvious that they did not want to be bothered when I spoke to them. I was told that this product was molded to fit my truck and was pre-drilled. All I had to do was attach the fasteners, which never came with the product. The splash guards came with an empty bag. I wound up just buying the OEM part, which was a lot more expensive, but lived up to its reputation. When I emptied the box that these guards came in all I found was two blank pieces of plastic. If you have a farm truck or a jalopy, these guards will be acceptable, but if you have a nice vehicle, I recommend that you just spend the bucks and not degrade your truck."
3,make no mistake,These are NOT like factory equipment. A lot of trimming and drilling required for my Taco. Hard to get perfectly straight. You get what you pat for.
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"This product is cheaply made. In the picture it looks like rubber but it is not!!!It's hard plastic, there is no give to the material and it cracked when I was removing the tabs that secured it to the cardboard backing..... that were part of its packaging!!!Spend a couple more bucks and get something better."
4,"Incredibly intense but also some very, very funny poems!","I only bought this book of poetry because the author has a music website that I visit frequently (it is called loudithfaire.com)I am not a big fan of poetry because I feel it can be TOO MUCH. Too dramatic. But the writing in this book is fun and clever. Is she sarcastic or just plain crazy? Is she in love or in hate?My favorite line: ""I now understand why there are flowers through out your extra fancy life in every antique vase/a petal for every fragile moment you wished yet again for love instead of disgrace""."
3,Good bag but wrong size,I bought this bag and really liked it....until I tried to put my laptop inside. According the manufacturer information my laptop should have fit with no problem. It didn't. Seems the rounded top took some of the size off. Great bag for a small laptop but I'm still looking for the right bag for me.
2,"High hopes, high frustration","I had high hopes for this book, and indeed there are plentyof interesting ideas here.However, the descriptions of the games are brief to the pointof obscurity, and the few illustrations that accompany eachgame are frequently inadequate.One wonders if the book's editor actually tried to playany of the games."
3,Good ideas poorly presented,"This book contains some fantastic games. I have used quite a few in my high school classes and the kids really enjoy them. I particularly like the fact that as exercises in logic, pattern recognition and planning they are great in the maths class, but are not obviously ""maths games"".My main complaint is that the instructions are very poorly written. There were quite a few games that left me completely confused. After reading a few I started to get the hang of the author's sparse language but it took a while."
2,Tinted Lenses,"Lenses are tinted not clear like in the current (1.22.08) picture. Fit well, and provide good dust protection otherwise."
5,One of the best WWIII novels ever written.,"Harold Coyles first book based on events from the book ""The Third World War"" By Sir John Hacket. This book does not deal with the politics of the war, it is just the combat thrill ride that you are looking for in a book of this type.Looking back now, some of the technical ifo may be a bit dated, but it does not take away from the book in any way.It is a nonstop combat action thriller, that is easily read, and not too technical for the novice, but still interesting for the more advanced reader.After reading this book, I bought the rest of Harold Coyles' books at a yard sale just based on the quality of this one book.They just don't write then like this any more."
5,Inspiring...A brutal description of war,"Team Yakee is an outstanding look at how war affects people and personalities. Coyle used authentic tactics and real to life descriptions of the ups and downs of combat. A great novel. I also like his use of maps, glossaries, and how he switches between the US and USSR. Great Job!"
3,It is a typical NATO book....,"It is a typical US book about how would NATO win war if Warsaw pact fought as NATO thought that Warsaw pact would fight. I am afraid that if something like WW III happened (thanks God it did not), Warsaw pact had to fight more desperately with full hand of very dirty (i.e. NBC) weapons. The behaviour of soldiers of Warsaw pact (mainly Russians, of course) is described very funny, mainly for people who are from Eastern Europe like me (I am from former Czechoslovakia). Quite funny are described also (Western) Germans. There are many clichés, stolen from other books or military movies (for example The bridge of Remagen in a final sequence or Kalahani's book about Yom Kippur 1973 war in a beginning of book). Nevertheless, when author writes about what he perfectly knows (US Army), he is very good. Some fighting scenes are very exciting..."
3,"A good read, but...","This was the second Coyle book I read (the first being ""God's Children"") and once again I was compelled by his gripping battle scenes and poignant view of today's combat environment. The story flows well and was generally enjoyable and engaging.However, by the end of the book I became disappointed because of the constant, repeated stupidity of the opposing forces. I felt cheated because it never seemed that the U.S. forces won due to good strategy & tactics as much as because the enemy used tactics a learned high school student would shun. Don't get me wrong, the book is a good read. I only wish Coyle would create an antagonist with some brains to serve as a challenging foil for our heroes."
1,Boring,"This guy writes like Sgt. Joe Friday talks. I'll never buy another book by Coyle.Everything is black and white, not a hint of human emotion."
5,definitely the best there is,"After spending the better part of my life as a tanker in the US Army I can credibly say that Maj. Coyle knows what he is talking about. The realism and technical knowledge he conveys is so much more than that of the average writer. This book brings back many memories for me, there is just nothing better than the M1A2's turret during live fire, the cordite smell, M240 machine gun fire, the AFCAP kicking back out of the breech... I love it and I loved the book, all perspectives and incredible insight. One question, did it ever come out in a hardback? Let me know. - A32 - 3rd Platoon 2nd Battallion 67th Armor, Friedberg Germany, 1st Armored Divisio"
5,Excellent overview of the history of the Greek language,"As someone who has studied both Homeric and Modern Greek, I found this book about the evolution of Greek fascinating. There is also an interesting chapter about the dialects of Modern Greek.The book is written in an extremely readable style. I read through it in only a couple of days. There is a large bibliography at the back of the book and I intend to look up some of the references."
5,Buy this CD !,"There's not to much I can say about these guys that hasn't been said in the other reviews - these guys are loud, and along with the vocals makes it easily comparable to early Rollins Band (which is a good thing). Dare I even say you can hear hints of Black Sabbath as well?They also do nothing to change their method of attack. Their songs show no secrets of where they're going, there's nothing lightning fast, no ""cookie monster"" vocals, no solos, you get the point. Think of steamroller that's slowly crushing everything.Okay .. you get the idea.This record is well worth checking out if your fan of heavy music."
4,Hardcore legend does it again.,"Shawn Brown is my hero. I love to hear his voice. This band is good, they have a really heavy sound and rock like nobody's business. It's not as good as Swiz, but if you love Mr. Brown, it'll do."
5,The Best Book I've ever Read,"The Mysts of Avalon is one of the best books I have ever read. I love all the Arthurian legends but this one really brings them alive. Marrion Zimmer Bradley has done a superb job of mixing legends and research. For me, this book was more than just a wonderful story and a good piece of feminist literature. This book shed light on the struggle between Christianity and the old Goddess worshipping religions and made me dream of being a priestess on Avalon. It is one of the most important works of pagan fiction and should be on every pagan's shelf. Everyone should read this book for its feminism and refreshing insights into Religion and Christianity, not to mention is beautiful retelling of a classic story."
4,Brilliant!,"The Mists of Avalon cast magic onto its readers, capturing them in Arthurian England. However, the book is not simply a beautiful retelling of the same story portrayed again and again by author after author. Marion Zimmer Bradley, unlike many writers, put great effort into her research to produce her book to produce something believably authentic, yet she is not a slave to the traditional retellings. The main character, Morgaine, is depicted is as a likeable human with good intentions rather than the one-dimensional cardboard cut out of an evil witch that Hollywood favours so much. The other characters are similarly given a depth that many interpretations seem to lack - each character has its flaws that make them more relatable for the reader. Marion was a brilliant writer and amazing woman; it was a great tragedy that the world has lost her."
5,Congratulations !! The most interesting book i've read.,I can't praise this book enough. I read it several years ago and i keep on re-reading it from time to time..I am Arthurian Legend buff and this book is the best adaptation i have ever come up with. The characters of this book are displayed with such perfection that you would think Mrs Bradley knew them personally..
4,Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley,"This book has a good mix of fantasy and real historical significance to the pagan religions and their comparisons to Christanity. I beleive that Ms. Bradley expertly pieced together history and fantasy to make this an interesting book set in the time of King Arthur. It was entertaining and let me see a new perspective on the King Arthur legend. It was very different from any other King Arthur legends I know of though. Still, I recommened this book for anyone interested in the mystical if not fantasy-like side of religion. She is a great storyteller."
4,Great picture of Celtic world,"If you like ancient history, romance, wars and the Celtic heritage, here's what you need to read!"
2,A contrary opinion,"I feel like I'm swimming against the tide writing anegative review of this book, but in all honesty Ididn't really enjoy it. I found the characters to bevery one-dimensional. All of the Christians were stupid,dull and brutish. All of the goddess worshippers weregentle, wise and interesting (unless they became Christiansin which case they became stupid, dull and brutish).The idea of writing an Arthurian romance from a women'sperspective was a good one, and some of Ms. Bradley'stwisting of the legend was well done, so I haven't givenit the lowest review. However, I certainly wouldn'trecommend it to my friends, or be tempted to reread it.In the future I'll stick with Mallory for King Arthur,and with Katherine Kurtz for fantasy."
5,Superlative,"Allow me to preface by revealing that I devour everything even remotely related to the Arthurian legend(s). Thus, it was with a breathless awe with which I reached for this book and found myself staying up late nights in a blizzard-ish attempt to consume all 870+ pages.The story is woven superbly. The characters leap into animation before one's very eyes, recreating the aura of a long-lost age with a brilliance that heretofor I had only known in Orson Scott Card's novels. There is a very thorough, very pronounced sense of setting illustrated by awesome scenery. This was truly a feast for the imagination.Highly recommended to anyone even remotely intrigued by Arthurian romance or whatnot. :-)"
3,One view of the Grail,"This book is worth reading. Personally, I prefer Agori's view of the Grail in Defenders of the Holy Grail. Agori also honors women and has 2 heroines. However ""Mist"" is a harder read, and rquires much more time to get through. Mists is somewhat judgemental, but will make you think. Why do we have myths? Whay are we here?"
3,Other Books,"A rather foggy version.As far as Arthurian stories go, this one is definitely on the tedious end, and pretty hard to get through. An actual case where I amazingly enough found a tv miniseries significantly more enjoyable. Anyway, this is told from the point of view of a more peripheral character, Morgaine, and details the conflicts between her religion and magic, and the new variety that is coming, as well as some of the usual backstory."
5,breathtaking,"this book changed my life. i have never read a book so rich in theme, plot, imagery, history, culture, and the aspects of life. fillied with love, hate, lust, anger, jealousy, duty, loyalty, and pain; this book touched me and there were many times i started crying just out of the sheer beauty of the story. this is my all time favorite book and i highly recommend it to everyone!"
4,Wow! This was an incredible book!,"I was really worried when I picked this book for an english assignment for school. Its 2 inch width almost scared me off! But luckily, I was hooked after the second chapter and couldn't put it down! It was an incredible story about perseverence and the strength of a woman. I loved this book! I would recommend it to anyone who has the time to read it."
2,Disinteresting,"Sorry for contradicting all the shameless flattery this book has received so far, but this book really was rather boring. The characters seemed to do too much drifting, without anything to capture the reader's attention in between important or interesting events. The race for power between Gwenhyfar and Morgan Le Fay becomes a race into Arthur's bed as these two use promiscuity as their power-gaining method. The concept of hearing about Arthur's legend from the perspective from the women involved is indeed a potentially excellent concept. However, there's more to the legend of King Arthur than unstable, hypersensetive women and their romantic problems. I suggest reading the original Knights Of The Round Table."
3,Christianity vs. Pagan,"Does anyone else who read this that was Christian find it offensive? I mean, I read it for the story, but some parts of it seemed a bit unfair. They complained about how my God was so narrow, and they are open, but then they go on to constantly complain and say the same things they saw we do wrong. Its kind of hypocritical, and seems to be biast. It also says Christianity is simple, but its quite complicated what with the Eucharist. And they mention no history of their own religion. And if these people truly believe that all gods are one, aren't they insulting Christ and my God? So in otherwords the story of the book is great, but if this is truly more about Christianity vs. Paganism, then i must say she didn't do a very good job."
2,A Warning For The Men,"While there's no question in my mind that Bradley is an astounding writer, I urge all men, especially fans of the cold and brutal legends of King Arthur to NOT read this book. Bradley takes romantic reworking to new and rather appaling levels in this retelling from the women's point of view. As an example, she somehow manages to make every rape, including the one of Arthur by his sister, into a beautiful, romantic affair. As an aside, it's notable that much of the book is almost documentary worthy descriptions of Wicca and its practices. Books with this much religious sympathizing of Christian practices are classifiable as ""Christian Fantasy"". I actually started to feel preached to after several hundred pages of it.Men, read with caution. Or stick with Malory."
2,A bleak read that takes itself way too seriously,"I love fantasy--and usually gobble up the best of the genre within a couple of days. ""Mists,"" however, was a very difficult book endure.I found the characters shallow, unlikeable and heartless. Morgaine, the protagonist, was weak, confused, amoral and inconsistently drawn. And she was about the best of the lot. Bradley hid her frail characters behind a mist of voodoo magic and New Age mistique... Peel that away, and there wasn't much of a story left.On the bright side, at least ""Mists"" wasn't riddled with grammatical errors. (However, in my view, removing a good 500 pages from the book would have been a wise move on the editing front.)In a nutshell: Hopeless, disturbing, confusing and dark... And far, far too long.Honestly, I'd rather have a root canal than slog through ""Mists of Avalon"" again."
3,Couldn't make it through this book,"After watching ""The Mists of Avalon"" on TNT, a bought the book at my local used book store. I tried really hard to get into the book, but maybe because I'd already seen the movie I just couldn't read it. I got as far as the threesome with Guinevere, Arthur, and Lancelot and I stopped reading (since that was a highlight from the movie and the book didn't make it too hot)."
2,A very unfair portrayal of Christianity,"I have heard so many good things about this book, but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It disappointed me in providing a totally unsympathetic, bigoted view of Christianity. It is true that the early Roman Catholics were harsh and intolerant, but the principles of the Church always were full of insight, intelligence, beauty, truth, and love. This book largely contributes to the stereotype of Catholics as drab and unreasonably demanding. If modern people would just look past all of this, they would find a truly amazing faith."
1,"Sad, truly sad...","I will not go into a lengthy critique of why and how this book gets one star...this was more than adequately provided by other critiques. Let me just say that it was truly a pitiful depiction of the Arthurian myth and a shameful presentation of women, and it is my intention to burn it with the rising sun at Beltaine as an affirmation and celebration of life and of the Sacred Feminine."
5,The best work of Arthurian fantasy ever written,"Bradley opens so many doors previously locked in Arthurian legend with this great novel. Many of the twists in story line she introduces here fit as a natural, albeit alternative, progression to the existing legend. If you only read one book of the legendary Camelot, make it this one. It's the most entertaining read since the original."
5,"Poignant, Powerful, Gripping!","The Mists of Avalon is contemperary King Arthur at his finest! Ms. Bradley makes us cheer and cry in one moving epic. She makes us believe in her bewitching world of Morgaine le Fey and the swirling mists of the enchanted land of Avalon. She artfully spins fact and fancy together and no seam is visible. Chivalry and the gallent knights still do exist, if only in our imaginations."
5,take these 5 stars and multiply them by the ones in the sky,"Amazing. Spell-binding. Inspiring. Whimsical. Down-to-earth. Moral. Real. Fantasy. SPIRITUAL! The absolute best novel ever. And I say that as a literature fan and a history major. Anyone who does not see the story, the depth, the character, the ingenuity, or the moral of this story learned nothing in school. This book is what every parent attempts to teach their child. Morgainne's growth as a person is what inspires this novel. The faults of all the characters prove the shallowness and wastefulness of bigotry. Bradley is amazing in her writing and her imagination is to be envied. Read and learn. And those of you who do not like it, please, reconsider, reread, and learn."
2,Quite overrated,"I felt this book (and series) were quite overrated. I like only a few fantasy books/series, and love a lot less. This was definitely not one of the books that impacted me.Although the book starts out well, it grows increasingly stale after that. The Arthurian legends have been incorporated into so many fantasy books that a book has to really execute fresh ideas in order to stand out from the crowd. None of the characters are particularly well drawn either.If you really love Arthurian legends and can't get enough of them (is there anyone really like that) maybe you might want to read this book. Otherwise, i wouldn't recommend it, to fantasy fans or newcomers."
2,Rent the movie,"I saw the movie first. Thank goodness. Then I at least got to watch Michael Vartan in bed. The book after the movie was too long, too slow, and followed very much the same story. The movie had beautiful imagery and was other-worldly. So I stopped reading and watched Alias so I could watch Michael Vartan again. But if you want to read a LONG book with great characters, read the Time Traveler's Wife instead. It is a much better use of your time and portrays a much better love story."
1,Big book-little reward,"I read this book as a member of a book club. It is very long, 900+ pages and I did not find it worth the effort. Other women in my club really liked it, but I found it depressing and dark. Life is too short to struggle through a book like this - there are other great things to read."
3,Engaging,"I couldn't put the book down, so I'll give it that... very engaging, but I grew frustrated with the constant dashed hopes and cruel perspective on human nature. The somewhat catty internal dialogue of the women also was irritating. Guess in a fantasy novel I'm looking for more heroism and less selfishness. This book provided a unique perspective, but left me wishing at least one of the women would have triumphed both in their quests and in their hearts."
5,Absolutely compelling and unforgettable,"I found this book absolutely compelling. It is a wonderful tale, beautifully written and gives an original and fresh outlook on a story which has been told so many times before. The characters are all very memorable and defined and carry the reader along with them on a very magical and unforgettable journey through Arthur's lifetime. I have travelled to Glastonbury to see the true Avalon and paid my respects at Arthur's grave. After reading such a book as this I had to see the real places.I would love to see a film of this book - But i doubt if one could ever do justice. I was very much shocked and upset to hear of Marion Zimmer Bradley's death and feel that it has been a great loss to literature. Please read this book! You won't regret it!"
2,Not to my taste...,"This book is well written, but too long. Perhaps as a male I need some more action in my books, but this book really could have benefited from having about 200 pages cut out. Also, the soap-opera basis of the character interaction got old very, very quickly. I couldn't finish the book. I must say that I found the religious argumentation quite interesting, but overall it was not for me."
2,I thought it would never end...,"I selected this book for a class I was taking about ""Medieval in the Modern."" It took me, someone who can devour a book in a day, almost two months to read. And I'm not blaming my slow plodding through the book on the length. I'm sure if I was interested, I could have whipped through it. Unfortunately, I wasn't. The story is a retelling of the Arthurian legends from the women's viewpoints, namely Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar. I often felt like the author was trying to make a page quota, because there were hundreds of pages of dialogue (lots of inter) that could have been taken out. The beginning bored me. The middle bored me further. The end picked up and got me interested for a while. However, overall, I was pretty disappointed. I don't think I'll be picking up anymore of the author's books."
1,Totallu Overrated,"I'm totally shocked that this dross had a four star score here. It's easily the most boring book that I've had the mispleasure to endure in the last ten years.I read it over the course of a summer where I didn't have a lot else to do, but after the first fifty pages, reading this wasn't a credible alternative.Don't waste your time."
4,Women Rock!,"This should be a must-read for every single teenage/college-age girl. It's so nice to read a book where women are powerful and where baby girls are important to a society (so many times we read that far back in history, families always wanted a boy to be heir, etc.) From page one, I couldn't put this book down."
2,Never understood the glowing reviews. . .,". . . and still don't. This book was not particularly well written. I did force myself to finish it, waiting for the promised magic. It never happened."
5,AN EXCELLENT RENDITION OF THE ARTHURIAN LEGEND,"This is an beautifully written novel that tells the story of King Arthur from the women's point of view. I am in the process of reading it for the second time and I still seem to catch myself in a trance when I am reading it, despite the fact that I already know what is going to happen next. This is a novel with that will make you fall in love, and yet hate at the same time. The only one thing I can say is that Bradley did a wonderful job with this version of the Arthurian Legends. I would give it 6 stars if I could. This is a ""must read"""
5,this was a great work of imagination,"i enjoyed reading this book a lot, it isnt often that i come across a book that i like this much. i think it will become a classic. for those readers that rated this book very low because it did not correspond with the way things really were in that point of time, i just want to ask you who stole youre imagination?"
5,A truly great read,"I've read lots of books, but this one is the best I've ever read! Marion Zimmer Bradley is a genius, this book made me cry, it kept me on edge the whole way through. I think this is MZB's best book yet, I loved it!"
1,anti-feminist fluff,"My name IS Morgaine- unfortunately for me, my mother read this book while she was pregnant with me. I am fifteen years old, and I can see that THE MISTS OF AVALON: A. is 4 or 5 hundred pages too long B. is plotless c. is poorly written d. lacks believable characterization e. is historically bogus f. and, most importantly, insults intelligent women-- if we are to have power over men, this book suggests, it must come from our genitalia, and not from our minds. I hope that the world doesn't believe that all feminists think the way that THE MISTS OF AVALON suggests that they should."
1,Overrated tripe,"The popularity of this book continues to amaze me. Like many books written to make a particular point, the author overreaches and undermines her purpose by using a heavy hand. If you want a more balanced Arthur, try Parke Godwin's Firelord.The reaction of the author's fans to the title of this review should clarify the problem with the book."
5,take the phone off the hook to read this!,"this has got to be one of the best stories i have ever read. the amount of research ms.bradly did on this novel is astounding. and through more than one thousand pages, i didnt put the book down but to sleep and eat. it consumed me. i dreampt of it. and when i read the last word, i immediatly flipped the book back to page one and read it all over again. must be read by anyone who has even a mild interest in the arthur myths, ancient history, godess worship, or femminist theory."
5,life changing,"if you are an extreme Christian, you will probably find this book offensive. I myself am of the 'old religion' (pagan/celtic) but I didn't really know that until I read this book. it really did change my life. as a girl not sure what she was, this book helped me find my answers. it doesn't by anymeans glorify the old religion. nothing is really glorified. it's so beautifully written! every character is a living breathing person with real emotions. Oh! I'v read it so many times. it isn't fast paced, it's true. but that is one of the beautiful things about it! it transports you to a time when life wasn't meant to be lived in a hurry. and it really is the kind of book you can read again and again. some books you can only read once. a beautiful journey into your soul that you'll never forget."
4,Ok if you like slutty characters,"The Mists of Avalon had a very interesting storyline. However, the characters' family trees were extremely complex. It seemed like everyone was sleeping with or marrying their cousins, aunts, half sisters, ect. In short, their relationships with each other were immoral and really gross. We would have given the book 5 stars (this was written by two friends who have read The Mists of Avalon and this our joint review) if the characters were not so permiscous and incestuous. The book also does not portray an accurate story of the legend of king Arthur. Most of what Bradley wrote was made up. For example, the mother goddess was not a main religion. But overall the book was Ok. Except if you want to read a more accurate and much better account of King Arthur, we strongly recommend reading T.H. White's ""The Once and Future King"" or Mary Stewart's Arthur series."
4,The Mists of Avalon Reviewed by a Teen,"I am currently enjoying The Mists of Avalon. Although it is a very long book, it is still insightful and exciting. This book offers a much different perspective from the traditional King Arthur tales. The story comes from what the women, Morgan le Fay, Igraine, and Guinevere, think. It gives the familiar story a new twist, and makes the reader see the whole plot from all angles. It is no longer just the brave knights fighting for the good of Christianity. The Mists of Avalon touches on the old religion that is being squished slowly out of existence, and gives reason for the way Morgan le Fay dislikes her brother, Arthur, and tries to keep her religion alive. These different perspectives make the book very real. The characters feel real pain and emotions, and sometimes their uncertainty is a reflection of real life."
5,The Mists of Avalon,"Do not let 876 pages scare you away from reading one of the most interesting accounts of the tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The most intriguing aspect of this book is that this era is depicted through the eyes of the women who lived it. I loved this book. A friend loaned me a copy to read and I have just finished purchasing my own copy. Usually I need instant gratification by reading shorter novels, but I received gratification every time I picked up The Mists of Avalon."
5,better twist,"This book was really well written, and was the turning point for my history with fantasy. I have to admit, this was my first real fantasy. It turned me on to female dominant writing, and helped me see into the eyes of ""the real"" King Arthur. The story told behind the women make it seem way more real, and show that we are always what is behind the making of big things, even if the men can't see it or even some women. Anyway, the book had a really believable story line that matched up with everything else I have learned in history class. My only problem was that I had no idea what to read first and so on. I started with this one, only to find out I should have read a different one first. So, where do I go now, was my main question."
4,Enchanting,"I got this book after I finished reading the Lord of the Rings Trilogy - which I also recommend - because I was absolutely enthralled in all the mystery of ancient myths and fables. This book is great. Absolutely enchanting, once you start reading you feel for the characters! One of the best books I've read yet!"
3,If this is all there is to feminism . . . .,"I began the book very interested in the alternative approach to the Aurthurian legend, and appreciative of the intricate cosmology offered by the author. By the middle of the book, however, I became disgusted by the whining nature of all of the main characters. This is billed as ""The Aurthurian legend from the women's point of view."" But it suggests that the major influence on women and their view of the world is whether or not they are pregnant, when they are pregnant, who is sleeping with who, and other Oprah-related topics. All of the women in the book were strong, each in her own way, and yet at the same time the major motivation for each was petty and mean-spirited. By the end of the novel, I was distinctly unimpressed."
5,Fascinating!,"When I find a good book...I say I found a good book. If you love the Arthurian legends, you should read this. This is the same story told through the eyes of the women folk of the period. Fascinating, well-written, intelligent, and turns the original on its side. Why didn't I find this sooner? Love!"
5,"great book, lots of detail","I love this book, just reread it after several years. I recommend this book to anyone who likes historical novels"
5,One of the most beautiful book I ever read,Before this book I had little to no knowledge of The King Arthur story. But this book sparked an interest that stayed with me through my many phases. I fell in love with Morgaine because of this book. It made me cry and it made me laugh . . . I stayed up until 4 in the morning so I would be able to finish it. It touched in a place few books ever have. If you read this book I recommend having a box of tissues handy.
4,A Womans Perspective,"I thought this book was really good. I hope this doesn't give too much away, but I thought the womans perspective to the story of King Author to be really refreshing."
5,A Living Story,"Of all the books I read about Camelot and it's time, MZ Bradley's book comes truest to life. I can almost feel the pathway leading up to the circle of stones that separates the worlds between the old ways and the christian ways. Marion Zimmer Bradley gives a realistic if not feminist look at the history of Cornwall. She makes magic a natural way for the people while explaining why the brutal downfall of Camelot and the disapperance of magic must take place. The voice the author uses through Morgaine is new to common belief. Morgaine now becomes a woman, a mother, and a victim of destiny, bearing the terrible resposibility of a priestess.Definitly one of the best ever."
5,Brilliant!,Simply unbelievable. This must truly have been a labour of love for Marion Zimmer Bradley -- it is so intricate. The ever-familiar Arthur legend is thrown through a new twist by telling the story through the lives of its women. The religious and spiritual aspects of the book are most intriguing and thought provoking. A very long read -- and well worth every minute!!
2,Singsong story-telling and fraught with error,"This book has long been recommended to me by friends for its wonderful story and character development. While the first-half of the book is masterfully plot-driven, it is not enough to cover for editoral mistakes. Further in the novel, the hypocrisy of the characters really grated on my nerves. Bradley quite obviously hated Christianity, but after reading this novel, how could anyone ever consider neo-paganism seriously? She completely destroyed her own thinly-veiled objectives. Additionally, the characters were not really developed at all and popped in and out of the story-line like soap-opera characters, without attention to previous plot. Not glad i spent the time on this as my first foray into Arthurian legend. NOT RECOMMEDED!!"
1,Don't bother--not worth it!,"I have long loved Bradley's 'Darkover' novels, but as an Arthurian scholar I was sorely diappointed in her treatment of my favorite legends. Rather than retelling the legend from a feminine (ie: Morgana/Viviane viewpoint) she has produced a pointless soap-opera of pseudo-Arthuriana and bad paganism. If you are into good Arthurian fiction try Mary Stewart's ""Crystal Cave"" series or Gillian Bradshaw's ""Hawk of May""/""Kingdom of Summer."" If you are a budding neo-pagan and you want ""real druids"" (as so many fans of this book seem to think it has) try a history book or face the fact that this is both bad history and bad fantasy. Try Parke Godwin or Persia Woolley for good fantasy with good historical background. Go back to Darkover, Marion, and try again--this book was not worth the paper it was printed on and the best hope for those who liked it is they may grow up eventually and discover real Arthuriana."
2,A Book Full of Weak Characters,"The first time I read this book, I was impressed by the depth of knowledge it revealed but at the same time I couldn't stand the way some of the characters were portrayed. The great King Arthur was actually weak and let himself be led around by the petty Gwenhwyfar, who was too dense to see anything past her precious Lancelot and her blind opinions about her religion. This book seemed to include men solely for the purpose of being used by the women. Although this book provided an interesting point of view on the Arthurian Legends including its relationship to Avalon, I highly recommend that you read anything else."
2,And the fairy yawned...,"A slow read indeed. While one can appreciate the amount of research that went into writing this tale, it's easy to overlook that because it's so damned boring. The legends of Arthur as told through the women involved and the magical lands they come from is an interesting idea and had potential to be an interesting story. But Zimmer-Bradley's writing is dull, repetitive and flat. The characters lack dimensionality and the A to B mode of story telling does not serve her well. If you are really into the Arthurian legends you may want to check it out, otherwise I'd recommend passing this one by."
2,ok but definatly long winded!,"this story was ok, just ok. it was pritty dry as far as i was concerned. and it was very much a book more for girls than for guys although not dramaticaly so. it was just boreing."
2,To different,"I read this book for a school book report and i found that it was completely different from the other versions of the Arthurian legneds. I saw the book to be too flodded with feministic views. The reason I say this is becasue Bradely i felt was trying to make the women seem important in this. I just dont like how she changed the story. Im not saying that women aren't important or anything like that, im just saying you dont change a legend like this to make women seem more important."
3,A fun read,"""Mists"" is one of the few MZB books I've been able to make it through, and I enjoyed the read. Exploring the Arthurian legend (for legend it definitely was) from the perspective of the women involved, Bradley weaves a marvelous tapestry of magic, intrigue and religious persecution.Up to a point.As always, I find Bradley's treatment of the male character condescending and ham handed. Many of her male characters are trite, throw-away and without any depth whatsoever. Nevertheless, the story is beautifully done, and the perspective on the legend of Arthur is unique.One can safely ignore the sequels to this work... I found them horrid, almost beyond recognition as originating from the same writer. ""Mists"", however, is delightful and interesting, if thin in places. In all fairness, I can't give this work any more than 3 stars, though perhaps it deserves more for imagination."
5,The Mist of Avalon,This is one book that I have found myself not wanting to put it down. My daughter has read it and even now on my second time reading I still hate to put it down even for a break.
2,"Well written, but distasteful socio-religious agenda","Marion Zimmer Bradley's novel of Arthurian Britain is undoubtably well-written, but is made one step above repugnant by the heavy-handed feminist, anti-christian story lines. The only men not condemned by Zimmer-Bradley are simpering druids who allow themselves to be dominated by the oh-so-wise priestesses of Avalon. And every Christian is portrayed as either a brutish, opressive lout (if male) or a submissive yet jealous shrew (if female). Arthur himself, far from being a heroic warrior king, is portrayed as a weakling torn between his Christian (in name only) wife, and his pagan sister. If you're looking for Arthurian historical fantasy that is not filled with ridiculous neo-modern tripe, go read Stephen Lawhead's excellent Pendragon cycle."
2,eh...,"As you can probably tell by other reviews, most people either hate this book or love it. I'm of the former school. While I acknowledge its importance as a ""feminist-revisionist"" approach to Arthurian myth, I'm just not a content-over-form type of reader. This book is abominably didactic, not to mention **very** poorly written. The dialogue is horrible. MZB's prose is stilted & amateurish (at best) & the whole thing just reeks of that cheesy neo-Druid goddess-worship that calls itself feminism. And those who accuse MZB of religious bias are correct. The anti-Xian stuff is a given, I think, but expected considering the book's subject matter. I wasn't bothered by it. However, Bradley is also pretty harsh on atheists & agnostics (like myself)-- in fact, she's pretty much harsh on anyone who doesn't subscribe to a very specific sect of paganism... Anyhow, there's better stuff out there, but if you're into all that pagan-""feminism"" stuff, this is probably the book for you."
2,Interesting waste of time,"After enough years of being told by various friends that I should read this book I finally did so over a long break. While it was vaguely interesting enough to hold my attention until the end (with a lot of skim reading and skipping around) I did not find it to be the life affirming, Goddess invoking be-all-and-end-all novel that so many have found it to be. I mean, have they not made it all the way to the end? By the time the tome draws itself to a conclusion, all of the ""evil Christians"" have been absolved and the ""pious pagans"" brought to shame and obscurity. Huh. I don't get the hype."
1,It's not quite worth all the hype.,"While this is a truly interesting take on Arthurian legend, it is not worth all the acclaim that it gets from its readers. The characters are all self-serving and shallow. I was unable to finish this book, due to my disgust at Gwenivere's mistrust and narrow mindedness. To all those who make the claim that nothing better in Arthurian legend has ever been written, I suggest that they go out and read some Arthurian legend in order to back their claim."
3,TOO LONG,"Perhaps this was cutting edge and needed when the women's mvmt was young, but it just went on and on until I was sick to death of the story and hated the main characters. Very disappointing and a waste of a lot of time. That's probably a bit too harsh. There are memorable characters and scenes; it has changed my view--forever-- of these well-known heroes."
2,The Book itself is much better!!!,"Ok, so I saw the DVD first, read the book book second, and then downloaded the abridged version thru iTunes. I definately recommend reading the book first, watching the DVD second, and then hearing the audiobook last. The audiobook starts with Morgaine being brought to Avalon. It completely leaves out the whole part of Igraine and Golois and then Igraine and Uther. This audiobook is a bit of a disappointment. I would definately consider buying the unabridged version of this (if they made it)."
5,A refreshing tale of Arthurian legends,"""The Mists of Avalon"" is an amazing contribution to the famous Arthurian Legends. Bradley describes everything in such meticulous detail. I couldn't put it down! You really care about the characters; they're alive, as real as you and I. You can feel their sorrow, their pain, their joy. Old characters become alive and new ones are introduced. I would read it again. Definitely a winner."
5,summary? just read.,"""all stories are true,"" i've heard it said. this one is not just true; it makes sense. bradley humanizes both ""good"" and ""bad"" and weaves a tale that gives motive to all the stupid mistakes that combined to form the majestic trajedy that was camelot.while this is not the best book i've read, nor is there any exquisite literary style to catch one's breath, bradley combines compelling characters with a unique, but believable, vision to bring us the most interesting telling of the arthurian myths to date."
5,A read that can change your view of all that you as truth.,"I have never become part of a book the way that I did with this one. Through Morgaine, Vivaine, and even Gwynhwyfar, my view of what I thought as Truth was completely changed. It caused me to question all that I know, all I have always seen as black and white for myself, and consider another facet. I came to realize that we have no place to judge the actions of others, as we were not standing in their shoes at that moment in time. Even my view of what we think of as Religion was changed. A true growing experience when read with an open mind."
4,Excellent Story with an imaginative twist,A strong feminist view point guided this story. Aside from the alternative take it was well written. I could hardly put the book down finishing in a 14 hour reading marathon.The book is a retelling of the Aurthurian Legends from King Arthur's sister (Morgan le Fay) point-of-view.
2,I am mortal,"The hours I spent trying to read this book will not be returned to me at the end of my life. Those were the thoughts that raced through my mind as I read past page 100 on the third attempt to finish this book. I am very sympathetic to the concept of strong women and a review of the Arthur legend in that light. Which is perhaps one of the reasons why I was so disappointed. The women seemed feeble to me, and I could not spot any real drive - which I really think you should be able to after 100 pages of a book. So, with the lack of motivation inside the book, my own motivation outside the book got lost. Life is short, and this book is long. If you are not into feeble women's court intrigues, this book ain't for you."
4,Loved it!,Morgaine is probably one of the best female characters that I've read (Only Pride & Predjudice's Liz Bennett sticks out in my mind more). Morgaine has attitude but can show her sensitive side. The Church vs. Goddess worship theme did get old (which is the only reason it didn't get a five). But I guess even that was a sub-theme of the idea of a world going through change and the accounts of those who doesn't want that change and the suffering that results.
4,Amazing for a Fantasy Fan,"With this book, I found that it moved along effortlessly from the viewpoint of Igraine, through to Viviane, then Morgaine and Morgause, leaving me at the end with an impressively wide perspective of the events of about 50 years. At the end I found that, although I could not remember the journey, I knew where I'd been. This is an amazing book for anyone interested in King Arthur and the knights of the round table. If you were a fan of Tamora Pierce when you were younger, this is also for you."
5,Amzaing,"Great story, vivid imagery. Recently I re-read the book and fell in love with it again. It is a great mythological tale filled with power, spells, love, religious conflict, betrayal, revenge, and sex... everything that makes reading a joy. But it is not only a great read, it had me thinking about society in general, how change just comes regardless of human efforts to stop it."
4,"Different, but good","Although this version of the Camelot saga is a little different from what I am used to, it is very well written and VERY creative. The author did a great job of describing every aspect of this fantasy world without going overboard on everything. It does seem a little bit like some sort of cult-culture, but it was an interesting change from the normal vaque descriptions of fantasy worlds in novels. One of the only complaints I have is the descriptions of Morgaine's, er, um, ""social activities"". I don't mind a little bit of ""laying"" with each other, but it got really old and descriptions were really trashy; I felt like I was reading some high quality romance novel. Overall, the book was very intriguing and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a different, creative fantasy book."
5,Wonderful,"This is an amazing book. Most other books on Arthurian Legend focus on the males, christianity, and have you loving Gwenythvar and Lancelot and hating Morgaine. This is MUCH different because you will mostly fall in love with Morgaine if you read this book. Yes, it is long, but I feel that it is well worth it. It gives the reader a whole different prespective of Camelot and life."
5,The BEST Arhturian Sage ever written,This story is a definate must for any lover of Arthurian History. Marion Bradley's telling of the story of Arthur is unlike any I have ever read. The story is told mainly by Morgaine (Arthur's half sister) and Vivianne (Arthur's aunt)and the lady of the lake. They fight to keep the old (pagen) reigion alive in Brittania. Arthur is sworn to be the Defender of Avalon who will keep the Goddess alive in the world of men. Plans seem to go correctly until Arthur marry's Gwenyfar(a pious and Fanatical Christian) who manipualtes and persuades Arthur to Betray his oath to Avalon. Written in perfect detail the characters seem almost non-fictitious as this book will capture you relentressly from beginning to end. Their are not enough words in the world to describe the impact this book will leave.
5,Thought provoking,"Even though the characters referred to in this book lived centuries ago, their perspective still offers insight into the minds of females today. On the one hand you have Gwenhyfar, the subservient wife bound to a man who she cannot love, and on the other hand you have Morgaine, the independant and liberated woman who cannot find happiness. This book is one of the first retellings of history from a female perspective. The Mists of Avalon is a feminist masterpiece."
4,Wow!,"Well, i must start out by saying that the Mists of Avalon is one of the best books i have ever read. It has great detail, and i love the way that Marion Zimmer Bradley changes the usual story around, and i like this one better! The rest of the books connected to this one were pretty good too, but this one was definetly the best!I loved it!"
4,Good reading,"I picked up ""Mists of Avalon"" after seeing ads for the TNT movie. I was intrigued by the idea of a retelling of the King Arthur saga from the female perspective. As a child I was fascinated with King Arthur story, but always wished there was more about the women.This book was so much more than I expected. I learned a lot about pagan and Druid religions and a lot about what the ""new"" religion of Christianity meant for these people.Morgaine (Morgan Le Fay) has always been portrayed as evil, but as the main character of this book, she was very sympathetic.The only complaint that I have of this book is the length. I am normally not intimidated by long books, but this one could have used some editing.I highly recommend it nonetheless."
5,An awesome version of King Arther in a female body!,I absolutely love this book. I would say this is one of Marion Zimmer Bradley's best book! She brings you right to the time period in what every fantasy lover wants. You will lose track of you own time. You will fall in love with Morgaine and her family. The magic with sweep you off your feet and leave you thirsty for more. Margaine learns as well as teaches you all about her life and others as a priestess. This is about as close to the Arthurian series as can get to truth. I totally recommend it!
1,"Mostly mean-spirited, dour read","If you like fiction laced with a vague, free-floating dislike or hatred of men (or ""males""), and the portrayal of Christianity as an evil force that sapped all of the joy and magic out of the world and enslaved women forever, this is the book for you. It's even got incest as a major theme, to boot!"
2,A New Age feminist's bible.,"A very prettily written book, this gives women their chance at telling the Arthurian legend. Unfortunately it is just too feministic and ""mystical"", with the characters worshipping the ""Mother Goddess""; something that sounds just a bit familiar today. The paganism and female-empowering feel similar to Xena and her spin-offs, so if you are looking for literature with depth, forget about this medievel Melrose Place and read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Anne Bronte). Now that is powerful."
2,I give this two stars only because I feel sorry for it!,"Maybe I'm just not a King Arthur fan, but I thought this book was horrible! I didn't enjoy reading this book one bit, but I did finnish it. I have to admit that the end was excelent and I couldn't have written a better ending myself, but the rest of the book was rambling and boring! I couldn't find which way was what, half the time I didn't know what I was reading!!! Not to say this book was all bad, because there where parts in this book that really touched me. Other than that I found this book a real bore!Out of 873 pages, 3 quarters of this book made any sense!!!! Excpet for the end, I found this book a real waste of time to read."
5,Loved It!,"When I read this book, I had never yet read any Arthurian Legends. So it was my introduction to the genre. Who knows if I would have have been obsessed with Arthurian Legends all throughout highschool and middle school if I hadn't read this book? If this book was the fuel for my interest then it was potent. I went on to read everything from the standard versions to the whimsical to the sensational. I even had the Arthurian dictionary. This book not only introduced me to Arthururianism, but it also has great information about magic. I have never yet seen a better description of scrying and how to scry-even in all the countless wiccan books that have come up. Also it explains that when you cast a spell on someone-you are forever entwined with their karma to some degree. (i.e. connectivity). If you haven't read this book yet you must immediately start! You will love it!"
4,A page turner,"This is a very compelling, addictive novel which kept me awake reading all night and haunted me for days after I finished it. I charactors are well-developed and realistic, the magical and spiritual themes are fascinating and I loved the epic plot line which spans three generations. However, it only got four stars from me as I found the feminist agenda rather intrusive and heavy-handed for my taste."
5,Not to be forgotten,"Told from the perspective of a woman living during the rein of King Arthur, The Mists of Avalon is a compelling fantasy story that immediatly enthrals the reader. The story chronicals the fall of the magical and sensatious world of Avalon to the pagan world of the church through the majestic ruler of Avalon, Morgain. Bradley writes the infamous tale with incredible genious and superb command for the language. Her tale will difinitivly withstand the test of time as one of the greatest fantasies ever written."
4,The Mists of Avalon,"This book is a great book. Although it is a tough read, and trying to keep the characters straight is hard, the story line is great! You must be prepared for a lenghtly read, it will take you awhile to get through it all. The first part of the book is just OK but once you get into Part 2-4, it really picks up. If you like reading about King Arthur era, you'll love this book."
5,Mists of Avalon Making historical lore inviting,"I hadn't p/u a novel since high school. (40'S). A friend lent me her copy of MOA. It made a renewed reader out of me. I devoured this book. Not only was it an easy and engrossing read, but for a kid who never learned about King Arthur, it enlightened me to so many things. Even though the book is told from a different perspective, it still gives insight to the many inuendo's in daily life that refer to the days of Arthur. I encourage women of all ages to take up this tome' and enjoy it page after page. It truly is a wonderful read."
3,Good but tooooooo long,"When I started this 800+ page book, I loved it. It captured my imagination and gave me a new perspective of the females in the Arthurian legend. Learning more about Morgaine's childhood and what shaped her was interesting. Around page 750 or so, it became somewhat of a chore to continue reading though. While I had to know what became of the characters, it became harder and harder to care, which disappointed me, as I really wanted to LOVE this book. While I recommend this book as an interesting slant on Arthur, Lancelet, Gwenhwyfar et al...I do so with the caution that it's a long drawn out read."
5,Mists of Avalon,"Really enjoyed this read, long but very interesting perspectives on religion, cultural behavior toward women and the interaction of fact and fiction in story telling."
5,A really great book,"Mists of Avalon, in my own opinnion, has to be one of the best books, written in this type of jenra. I particulary enjoyed reading the story of King Arthur from the view point of the women involved in his life."
4,Pity the length and what became of the Authurian legends,"I loved the book from the start, but it's length is very hard and after a while without enough patience, i almost put the book away...finally i finished it, (an achievement of sorts) i was quite glad for it to end, sad the way it ended, but left questioning still what became after that, who should have led Britan and all. Might be the length, but it gets rather draggy at the end. Still, a good read all the same, i don't reckon i'll be picking the book up very soon, but no doubt i will for sure again."
5,Mists of Avalon,"I purchased this book to replace an original edition autographed by The Author. I loaned it to a friend,who unfortunately lost it! The story is so classic and enthralling weaving magic of the Goddess and Authurian story, that one feels they are present in the same time and place. I wanted the complete works of Marion Zimmerman Bradley to share with my Grand daughters."
5,Mists of Avalon,"This book is one of my all time favorites! I keep having to buy new ones, because I am always giving mine away. This is the kind of book that you can really sink your teeth into, with great characters and detail. This is King Arthur revisited, from the viewpoint of all the women! Eye opening, spiritual, and simply beautiful."
5,A different take on Arthurian Legend,"I first read this book in 1998 in my honors English class and I loved it. Very detailed take on Arthurian Legend from a different prospective centered on the women. The legend and the Age of King Arthur is vividly brought back to life in very descriptive and beautiful narrative. The places, the people all are brought alive in ones imagination when reading this novel. Recommend to all those who like Arthurian Legend."
3,Excellent but Boring,"I have read both Mists of Avalon and Forest House. Both have excellent character portrayal. You really feel you are living in the time with all the conflicts between ancient and ""modern"" British civilization. The viewpoint from the women's perspective is very good. I particularly liked the portrayal of the mysticism surrounding the ancietn Celt Goddess. However, the book was tedious and very slow moving. I had to work up a mindset to read it. It was not one I longed to get back to and couldn't wait to start up after laying it down."
5,The Mists of Avalon,Rates as one of my top five books -- this is one of the few that I will ever re-read.
2,Incestion,"So... yeah, incest. Mordred is the son of Morgaine and Arthur, brother and sister, and that relationship didn't seem as accidental as it is often portrayed. After that, Margaine called Mordred (or is it Gwydion, who can keep it straight) her lover. Incest with the incest-baby. That damn family tree keeps curving backwards. It looks more like a bush!"
5,"Great But Dark Book, By a Great But Flawed Thinker","Pascal was undoubtedly a genius and this profound work further demonstrates that fact. Not for the feint-hearted, this work is very dark in places, but it is a passionate work by a very great, if flawed (is there any other type?), thinker. I deeply love this book. It is at times extraordinarily insightful and lucid, ranging over a variety of subjects, but as an atheist I find most of the religious passages heartbreaking. One needs to be damaged, but strong, in order to appreciate this wonderful book and this giant of a man."
2,Not complete trash,"First of all i have to admit that i love pascal programming language and i think it is the best language no matter what, and the person behind this Blaise Pascal whom i thought was an influential philosopher (but he refuses to be called), is happened to be low quality hundred percent lame christian apologist as one of the fellow reviewers said above. After reading through pensees i understand why he isnt praised everywhere and approached very reluctantly by the high caliber intellectuals. I have to admit that besides he is being boring to death, his thoughts are not without some insight, especially the non religious and shorter ones. He seem to be in a constant war against himself (and against Montaigne) by the christianity at his league. If you read between the lines carefully you can see a man in pain and agony for a whole life and want to believe in the presence of kind and compassionate being who would ease his misery."
2,one good point,"The single redeeming quality of this work is the strength of Pascal's style. He had a mastery of the French language. His religious thoughts, however, leave something to be desired. Pascal proved in his pitiful ""wager"" argument that he was no philosopher - he should have remained a scientist. If one wishes to read great French prose, one should try Montaigne's essays - they are infinitely more insightful. As for religious or philosophical work, I can not recommend more highly Voltaire or Hume."
5,classical and complete,"absolute bible in elasticity, every professor who teach elasticity would list it among the reference books. But you have to invest much time to understand it."
3,Disappointed with inaccuracies re NZ / AUS toys,"I am a NZ collector and have kept records for last 5 1/2 years which do not agree with descriptions, dates and other catalog info published in this book. Having written to Author with correction list, like a few others have also done, I was disappointed with the total nil-response. Many NZ collectors are still trying to find toys that were never released here, though the book says otherwise. Pictures etc still helpful for reference regarding some countries."
5,A great book.,This book includes lots and lots of pictures of Happy Meal Toys issued around the World. The ckeck-off boxes make it very easy to organize and keep track of your collection. It is also very useful in finding out which toys were issued and when
2,Flimsy construction,"I ordered this unit, unboxed it, and noticed the door was hanging down on one side so that it left a gap at the top on that side. I guess if I wanted to heat the kitchen in addition to the food, this would be a desirable feature.The door's handle is so flexible I was afraid it was going to break off.Back in the box it went. Fortunately, Amazon has an excellent product return system.I highly recommend skipping this poorly made oven."
4,I want to be Alton Brown,"So yeah, I basically got this only because AB uses it... From the first time I laid eyes on it on the show I searched far and wide to find it... Going into countless Bed, Bath and Beyonds, Targets, William Sonoma, etc... I ended up getting it from his site, because I figured why not support him in his endeavors (although I'm sure he's doing pretty well...) Finally found it on his site and couldn't be happier!"
3,It's Hard To Hold,"I wish I had noticed the other reviewer. The ""handle"" is straight and flat. You can't easily hold onto the handle and open with one hand, then season with the other hand. The handle needs to be looped or curved. Know that before you buy."
4,"useful, but be careful of the bottom","I got one because Alton Brown uses one, and its great to have on the table. I wish it had rubber feet, though, because its just bare metal at the bottom which will scratch your tabletop. As a fix I went to a hardware store, bought a sheet of cork, and glued it on. However it really should come with something to protect the surface it sits on."
5,Great salt server and spoon,"I do tend to read other customer reviews before ordering. Some reviewers stated that this server was hard to hold and others said it did not have a thumb tab on top for opening, it does.I can't imagine a better product, unless the server was made out of solid stainless. But then again, it would cost much more than this one and you really can't tell from the top unless you turn it over to look at the bottom side. Of course you wouldn't want to do that when it has salt in it."
1,Ironic Name,"For something called ""Endurance"" the lid broke off the first time I hand washed it. Very cheaply made in the hinge area with no way to repair the hinge pin. I'm mystified as to how it was attached in the first place. It's almost like it was glued. I couldn't find any solder or a weld joint.To echo the some of the other reviews this is most definitely NOT the one used by Alton Brown. The lack of the vertical handle is a shortcoming when you try to open it one handed off of the counter."
3,"Good looking, useful little countertop kosher salt dispenser","Does what it's supposed to, and looks good doing it - I particularly like the silicone seal around the top to keep humidity out of the salt.Why 3 stars? One star off each for:- Didn't come with the spoon like the picture said it was supposed to- The glass isn't clipped to the metal. I had a couple close calls when holding it with my fingers from underneath and the glass popped up out of the metal surrounding it until I trained myself not to do that."
5,Nice,"I ordered this for my boyfriend who loves to cook. It looks nice on the kitchen counter and he uses it every time he cooks. I first thought it would be a useless gift (after all, its for Salt!) but have since decided that I like it very much. Very handy."
4,Good product,"I use this as a Ghee ( melted butter) server.The glass bowl is removable and its thick (like pyrex)The spoon is very small , just about right to serve little quantity of anything."
3,It holds salt and looks cool,"I also bought this because of Alton Brown ;) I like that you can pinch the salt fairly quickly because the spoon is so tiny I never know what measurement it is, I end up oversalting or undersalting when I use it. I also quickly learned that pinching salt has a few annoyances (for me personally because I'm a mess in the kitchen): if your hands are moist, you end up with salty fingers; I hate salt in my fingernails!; never knowing how much a pinch should be; opening the container with hands full of food is not easy! Otherwise, the container looks pretty cool."
4,salt cellar,"Product is fine except that I wish it had a looped handle you could puta finger through so you could pick it up more easily to use. You cannotpick it up and open flipper lid with one hand as easily (actually, at all)with this little tab handle. I also think the wee little spoon is next touseless...just using your finger for a pinch is more effective. I have seensalt cellars with deeper bowled spoons that were more useful. This one justseems like a toy. But otherwise the overall construction is sturdy and wellmade."
5,salt server,This is a nice little salt server (can be used for other things as well). It looks professional and is easy to handle. I love it.
4,Salt Cellar Silver...,"Well, I broke my hubby's original Alton Brown salt cellar which was stainless steel finish. This one looks stainless in the image but it's silver not stainless. Other than that, it works! HTH!"
1,No happy with this salt server,"I put this on my wish list and luckily someone purchased it for me. I don't want to sound ungrateful at all but this is not at all what I had expected it to be. It is NOT the same as the one Alton Brown uses on his show. Which is hard to see that from the photos (when I first looked at the item there was only 1 photo), now there are additional photos of the item which shows that is has basically no handle to hold the salt cellar. The seal on mine keeps the lid from closing and it looks like it is ajar and will allow moisture in. When I tried opening and closing, when holding by the ""handle"", the lid of the cellar I about dropped out of my hand. I don't know about anyone else but I'd prefer not to spill a bunch of salt and have broken glass in my kitchen, because of a poorly designed item. I hate to return gifts but I think this has to go back."
5,perfect,Elegant as well as practical. What else could you want? The salt server is just as described but even prettier. Makes me feel like a professional chef.
5,Love this salt server!,I have been thoroughly pleased with this product. It is very handy as I cook a lot and it looks very nice sitting out on the counter. I highly recommend this item.
4,Good purchase,"Pros: good price, holds a good amount, sleek style, comes with a spoon.Cons: the spoon is really tiny, the rubber ring can come loose if you're not careful and can be difficult to reattach."
3,"well made, but awkward to use","this is the classic ""alton brown"" salt cellar - almost. it consists of a glass cup that sits in a steel frame with a steel lid that is kept tight by a silicone gasket.however - be aware that, unlike alton brown's model, this one does not have a curved, trigger-style handle. this means that opening it and holding it up at the same time cannot be done. you must first open it and then bring it up. i have a cheaper model with a trigger handle, and while it's much, much easier to use, it lacks the silicone gasket and it has a notch for a small spoon, both of which pose a problem in keeping salt from the elements. so i have chosen to keep this one. had it had a trigger handle, it would rate five stars."
5,BETTER THAN THE OLDER MODELS MUCH BETTER.,THESE NEW SALT CONTAINERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE I PURCHASED 3 YRS AGO. I ACTUALY HAD TO TAKE IT TO A FRIEND WHO WELDED IT BACK TOGETHER. BUT I LOVE THESE THINGS THATS WHY I NOW HAVE 4.
5,just like tv,This item looks just like the one which is used regularly in the good eats kitchen with Alton Brown. Works as expected looks great left out on the counters.
5,Great Product!,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband. I wanted one that was like the one that Alton Brown uses. I chose this one because the lid did NOT have a little spot for the spoon to stick out, I wanted a better seal. This is great, very durable and there is a tiny rubber ring around the lid that gives a much better seal than I expected."
3,Lid precision,"This cellar looks nice and works reasonably well, but when it arrived, the lid didn't fit properly on the glass below. I needed to bend the metal handle supporting the lid a little to get it to sit properly. It still doesn't fit perfectly, but it works ok. This summer has been very humid and the salt on the top can get a little crusty."
2,NOT as pictured and cheap looking.,"I just received this salt server and the wife immediately shot it down as ""looks cheap"". A very noticeable difference in mine is that the clear rubber flange that rings the inside of the top has half a dozen small rubber anchors that push through holes on the top of the metal lid. While I'm sure this helps keep the rubber flange from falling out, the rubber nubs that are visable on the top and are NOT pictured on the online image look stupid. I am dissappointed because I am an Alton Brown lover and wanted to have the real McCoy. I'm returning it and will purchas an Olivewood salt cellar instead."
5,Perfect,"Big enough for adequate supply, lid closes well with gasket to keep moisture and dust out. Easy to clean, lid opens easily and will stay open if desired and comes with a cute little spoon for when your hands are wet. I can't think of anything more that it needs"
3,Colour is wrong,Hi we purchased this walker for my mother because she loved the pinky coral colour and the sturdiness of the walker. She was bitterley disappointed when the walker arrived as per the promised shipping time only to see it was a burgundy colour...she wanted pink. We could have bought it from riteaid straight away instead of orderering from amazon. Even the box was a different colour. Carex change your colour to what it really is and stop misleading advertising to the elderly. Shame on you.
4,Good product for the price.,"This product is very helpful. The only complaint I have about the product is, that it is made in China. I did not know that! I like to buy American made products! I think it should shown in the advertisement, that it is made in China!"
3,I Dood It,"Silly flick, only redeeming quality is the Dorsey Orchestra! The arrangements are excellent."
3,Good but not great,"I really like most of Red Skelton's pictures (The Fuller Brush Man is my favorite) and I have never seen Eleanor Powell be anything less than spectacular, but I couldn't really get into this picture. It is good, and well worth watching, but it is not the best that either star produced. Many of Eleanor's routines are recycled (including the ""battleship"" dance which is lifted intact from ""Born to Dance"" as is the hula that was taken from ""Honolulu"") and Red didn't seem to be trying. I got the feeling that they needed to put out a picture and this is what they came up with. Funny, yes, worth watching, yes, wonderful and great, sadly no. It is far superior to any comedy that has been put out in recent years but it still lacking something that keeps it from being top-notch."
5,Can listen all day,There is nothing I do no like about this set and I have played it a lot and it sounds perfectly wonderful in the background at a gathering.
4,The New World of Mr. Tompkins,This book is a great way to explore physics outside of the classroom and outside of the textbook. This book allows the reader to take Einstein's Theory of Relativity and see it in a way that is vivid and allows the reader to understand the concepts behind Einstein's great theory. The author that revised the book added extra adventures that helped the context of the book. The added illustration and charts are an added bonus that help the reader gain more of an understanding.
5,Physics=awesome!,"I normally do not like to read, but i didn't mind reading this. It only took a week, which is good for someone who does not like to read. Never before had I had such an incredible grasp of physics. This really helped to understand the concept of space-time and other areas. This is Gamow's best and everyone is encouraged to to read it. Take it from someone who does not read often. For those of you who may be misunderstanding the concepts and experiments in physics, this book will help you. It mentions a topic more than once and allows one to understand it. Thanks Mr. Gamow for writing this book. I would also like to thank my physic's teacher, Mr.Mike Lanham of Sprayberry High School in Marietta, Georgia, for developing love and passion of physics and reading!"
2,"""Hollywood Squares"" Goes to the Movies","Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. pooled their resources to create a perversely watchable disaster. Running nearly three mind-boggling hours, producer Irwin Allen's ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974) represents the cinematic equivalent of ""The Hollywood Squares."" All that's missing is Paul Lynde. Inexplicably nominated for Best Picture, this skyscraper soap opera makes ""The Poseidon Adventure"" look like ""Battleship Potemkin."" A blockbuster cast generates ""take-the-money-and-run"" embarrassment - except for the inimitable Fred Astaire, who exudes class in the cheesiest of surroundings. (Few things are cheesier than William Holden's red velvet tuxedo.) Stirling Silliphant's ludicrous script includes the most unintentionally hilarious dialogue this side of Ed Wood. The film's strongest asset lies in its much-touted special effects. Seen today, ""The Towering Inferno"" exists more as a pop-culture artifact than a compelling piece of cinema."
4,She HITS the side of the building falling down!,"Okay, okay... A show of hands! How many of you cried when Jennifer Jones' character not only FELL out of the glass elevator but she whacks the side of the building on her way down - to reallllly rub her death in! Like the Brady kid was even worth saving, right?I think I'm in therapy now because of that...."
5,Edge of seat!,Outstanding movie that did keep me on the edge of my seat! Arrived fast and in perfect condition too! Recommend this exclusively to all you movie buffs!
4,Great Video Quality. Disappointing Audio,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The 2.35:1 (or 2.40:1 - it is hard to tell the difference) video presentation was great to excellent. I didn't see any grain at all. I give it a 9.5 on a 10.0 scale.The DTS-HD 5.1 Master audio was disappointing. I thought I heard sound from the surround speakers once during the movie, but I wasn't sure. I think the ending music had some surround sound. But during the movie, 99% of the sound came from the center or front speakers, and I couldn't hear any stereo separation coming from the front left and right speakers. The sound just seemed to come from the center speaker.Overall, a good Blu-Ray purchase, because of the great video quality."
5,Let's have a barbecue!,"The highwater mark of the late Irwin Allen's filmmaking career. This is another one of those high-budget, all-star cast disaster flicks of the seventies; but many can say it's the best. Great cinematography and special effects make this film a great attention getter and retainer. It teaches a great lesson on just how a little carelessness and negligence can go a long way."
3,"For a new dvd, i was not impressed that it didn't come sealed","For a new dvd, i was not impressed that it didn't come sealed like the other 2 movies I bought from other sorces on Amozon.com. This move is a present and I am wondering if it is indeed a new movie. I haven't had time to check it out to make sure it plays and at the same time with it suppose to be a new movie, I don't think it is right for me to play it to make sure it works. Cause in my eyes it then becomes a used movie. Since I don't buy a lot fom here I am going to just deal with this copy and hope that it plays fine for the person I am giving it to for Christmas."
4,"Not as good as ""Poseidon"" but entertaining","Irwin Allen's apex was ""The Poseidon Adventure"". ""The Towering Inferno"" boasts bigger stars, more elaborate sfx (including the dress worn by Dunaway that she managed not to ""pop"" out of), and a more complex score from John Williams. However, the script could've used a few more rewrites to erase the lapses in logic.That withstanding, the movie does what it was intended to do: provide a couple of hours of escapism. Sadly, the scenes of flames shooting out of the side of the lumbering edifice are frightening reminiscent of the short glimpses of fire from BOTH towers of the late, great World Trade Center.Who would've thought that an image from a 30-year-old film would foretell a horror unthinkable to most Americans?"
4,Not Realistic Enough!,"Where's the fire?The Towering Inferno would've / should've / could've been a great film had it spent more time focusing on the fire department's battle against the conflagration.More effort should have been put into showing people the nightmare a large city fire department faces in taking on a fire in a skyscraper.With more effort on the fire sequences, and less time on trivial sub-plots & rediculous action sequences by non-fire fighters, TTI would've been a spectacular film.Maybe someday, somebody will want to take a shot at doing a remake that would do justice to any fire department's worst nightmare!"
2,OH BROTHER....,"IF YOUR WIFE UTS THIS MOVIE ON ,VOLUNTEER TO WALK THE DOG FOR 2 HOURS IN THE RAIN..IT'S THAT BAD.NEWMAN STOOPS TO A NEW LOW.FAKE BUILDING AND BRIDGES ...TERRIBLE!"
1,Got a Match?,"Somebody once asked James Garner's character on ""The Rockford Files"" TV show if there was nothing he wouldn't do for money. He wouldn't kill for it and he wouldn't marry for it, he said, other than that he was pretty much open to suggestions. Paul Newman and Steve McQueen must have been open to suggestions when they ok'd this turkey, and I wish they had said no. The world's tallest skyscraper is burning due to shoddy construction work, and architect Newman and fireman McQueen would like to put it out before the entire cast is incinerated. On top of the building are a million gallons of water in reserve Newman forgot about in all the excitement. Why this 2500 ton weight hasn't gone crashing into the basement we are not informed but the daring duo manage to blow up the tanks and there's your happy ending. O J Simpson rescues a cat and Fred Astaire, after a lifetime of giving the American movies some of their greatest moments, was awarded an Oscar for enduring this production."
3,Good Special Effects,"The Towering Inferno is definitely one of the best of the disaster movies and I reccomend it to anyone who likes to watch these types of movies. The dialogue and some of the acting are a little cheesy but some of the acting is very good especially the acting from Paul Newman and Steve McQueen and most important of all are the special effects which are very impressive. I had this on tape, taped it off of AMC but it was taped over so I might buy the movie on DVD someday."
4,Ah...memories,"Arguably the king of the 70's disasters flicks, The Towering Inferno takes a couple of crazy ideas like build a tower 135 floors in San Francisco and let's do it on the cheap. What's the worse that can happen? Blessed with an all star cast and armed with some state of the art (at the time) pyrotechnics, The Towering Inferno, despite the cheese, doesn't fail to thrill you. It's fun to guess who's going to live and who's going to die. Never mind why it takes so long for the fire department to arrive and why didn't everyone just go to the roof and have an arm of helicopters pick them up. Or better yet-blow the tanks earlier. Still, it's good entertainment."
4,Classic movie and great entertainment!,I loved this movie! Every member of the cast is in the right place here and it makes this film one of the big classics.
5,This is a MUST HAVE for any collection.,"You should know the story, and have probably seen this movie at least once, so I'll spare the synopsis.This was a movie made with big names, great actors, and actually very believable and realistic special effects, and sets - long before the days of computer enhancement.Even if you know how it will all end, you'll be drawn in again and again. A truly great movie, now available on DVD at an exceptional price. This movie is actually good to share with a whole new generation (small children may find the subject matter a little frightening), and holds it's own very well against more modern movies of the genre. One of the biggest and best disaster movies EVER made. Enjoy!!!"
5,The Towering Inferno,"When I was middle school student, I saw a Poster of ""The Towering Inferno"" st theater. When that time, the panic movies were trendy and interesting. I watched this movie at theater and after on TV. It was defferent on TV and theater opening scean. But at this time, this movie is best of panic movies."
3,"Three stars only for the ""camp"" appeal...","I was traumatized by this movie as an eleven-year old girl who was dragged to it by her mother, who wanted to see it because all her ""boyfriends"" (Newman, McQueen, Chamberlain) were in it.My husband asked me to get this DVD for him because of all the extras on it, which I admit were pretty good. For older kids and adult fans of ""disaster"" flicks, this is one of the better ones. The movie takes on new significance post-9/11."
4,Got a match?,"Faulty wiring on the 81st floor ignites an inferno that traps partygoers on the 138th floor in Irwin Allen's second disaster epic. No real story to speak of, but the real star here is the fire, and the special effects are gripping with more shattering glass than any Walter Hill movie you've ever seen. All star cast includes Paul Newman as the building's architect and Steve McQueen as the battalion chief. O.J. Simpson is suitably cast as the security guard responsible for everyone's safety. A helluva ride, with enough raging fire and rushing water to delight disaster film fans. Paul Newman's late son Scott appears as a fireman. This was the last of the great 1970's disaster films."
5,Amazing Blu Ray movie,We have just recently converted to a Blu ray player will not go back to DVD. This movie is a must with the special effects even though it was made in the 60's.
1,dvd the towering inferno,Be very careful ordering DVD's from Amazon. I purchased The Towering Inferno and The Sting and neither are compatible with DVD players in Australia. I have just wasted around $50 on these. Buyers should be warned of this before purchase
3,"Good book, reprinted in 2004, not rare","This is a good book, friendly and accessible and an easy read. But there's no reason not to borrow the 1966 edition from the library or buy the newest reprint, if content is what you're after.It's a NICE book but not the be-call and end-all. You can even read large excerpts on the Net to see if you want to buy it.At a reasonable price for a brand new reprint, it's a good buy. This guy speaks with an authentic post-WW2 tone that's refreshing.At $90+ for a ""collectible,"" it's a big silly.When Amazon.com gets the reprint in stock, get one."
2,Not worth any discounted price.,"These books are okay, and would be a great help IF you could actually see anything on the teeny little photos in these very small paperback editions. If they were the full size books, 9x7 or larger, the captions of the photos would make sense. It seems some of the photos were mixed up while downsizing and some, no matter how hard you look, do not match captions. In others, understanding of course they are b/w photos, you cannot tell what the characters are doing or even what the author(s) are talking about. When they made the books for this set so small, they ruined any help they might have been. I was not impressed and won't buy any more of these sets of guides."
1,A Strategy Guide for The Sims? Why?,Really unnecessary. The game is the easiest to play in the world. There is no end to the game hence no need for strategy.
3,Not that cute,I was a little disappointed with the rabbit. Not as cute as other webkinz stuffed animals. I really believe that could have done quite a bit more to make a rabbit cute and they did not.
5,THEY ROCK,"The Osmonds never got the props they deserve. They actually wrote their own music and played their own instruments. yeah, some of their songs are treacly, but alot of them rock and rock hard. Not just ""Crazy Horses"" check out, ""Hey Mr. Taxi"", ""Hold Her Tight"", and ""Life Is Hard Enough Without Goodbyes"". I do think the asking price is just a tad too high....500.00 for a pirated cd? WOW"
2,"In Search Of ""And You Love Me""","I bought this album when I was 5 years old, and still have it, all scratched but a bargain compared to this $500.00 offering. I love standards, and there's a song on this album by Wayne Osmond that's gone totally unrecognized even at the Osmond website titled ""And You Love Me."" I'm grateful to this seller for listing the songs, because I was searching for it on iTUNES and coming up blank. If any of you can access this ONE SONG from CRAZY HORSES, you will be delighted. The song is worth the whole album, but not $1000.00 or whatever."
5,You're A Sissy If You Don't Read This Book,"Another fellow managed to cover all the eloquent intellectualities, but the simple truth is that this here book is a good look at a great man. Abbey is legendary, indeed, and that's a good thing, for the stuff he defended deserves a hero and the folks he poked mercilessly with his sharp stick wit (just about about all of us, but especially money-grubbing land-rapers and the lackadaisical dogs who can't bother to oppose them) deserved the poking. Buy this book, then let it collect dust until you've read through Abbey's words to discover him for yourself."
4,Wool Rug Hooking is inspiring,This book has wonderful information and pictures. Also has lots of simple projects with detailed instructions. Would definitely recommend to a friend and just might buy one for one of my friends for Christmas.
5,Adorable,"In a post-apocalyptic world devoid of humans, 7 talking animals unite for a quest to London where they wish to discover the identity of one of their friends. On the way, they meet quite a few interesting animals and exciting adventures. This is an adorable book appropriate for pre-pubescent children, with a reading level of perhaps a 10 year old. It is also quite enjoyable for adults who like children's lit. I wish it were still in print!"
5,entertaining read,"""futures markets run on a potent mixture of adrenalin fear and smarts...where 10% take home 90% of the winnings...""Kroll doesn't mention that his role model often quoted, Jesse Livermore went bankrupt 3 times, and killed himself.And every strategy that I've tried in this book has never worked (for me ). This book is cursed!!!Entertaining read though."
1,An enemy of Free Humanity...,"I buy this book to better understand how these one world government fascists, like Mr. Soros, think in their control freak brains.Soros is one of the few faces of the New World Order that are on the open... he is just a minion... like an upper management... the real minds are behind the scenes.Regardless what he believes and what hell of global government he advocates, hell soon or later will catch up with this devil.Long live to the Republic and screw the New World OrderGianluca ZannaDon't tread on US"
2,a bit portentous,"Mr. Soros certainly deserves our consideration at least as a currency trader, but his prescription for world economics is tainted with a naive, Utopian world view. Like Marxists, his ideas sound wonderful and longingly cooperative, but the real-world will not cooperate nor will governments and corporations play along unless their self-interests are met first."
4,good read on the world economy,"I had been told that Soros is a socialist. I didn't get that impression from this book. He may be more on the liberal side with some of his ideas. However in this book he is expressing some very good advise on dealing with the financial aid to underdeveloped countries, on what countries such as America, Great Britian should enforce when giving financial aid and on what IMF, World Bank and UN roles should be. I'd say the guy has a better understanding of the world economy than any politican and at least he is giving solutions instead of just stating faults of the past. In this book he demonstrates a capitalist view not socialist."
2,Not very comprehensive - if thats what you're looking for,"This book is good for younger children or people who just want a very basic overview of the human body. I bought it to help me study for my anatomy class, and this book did not provide nearly enough detail to be a good reference guide for me. If you;re taking a college level anatomy class, buy the more expensive coloring book!"
3,General examples for Anatomy course,"The Human Anatomy coloring book would be good to refresh ones memory, but as far as taking an Anatomy class and using it, for me it didn't go into as much detail that was required for my course. It doesen't have as much detail as I needed."
4,Coloring Book,This is a great study companion to any anatomy class that you are taking. Helps review & coloring the area gives you a better way to review what you are currently studying.
4,Human Anatomy colouring book,"This is a great book for a more complex look at human anatomy. It covers the basic anatomy and goes to a deeper level on some systems.A good start in my anatomy revision but I will now be looking for something better still, if such a thing is available.Would certainly be of benefit to high school and new nursing students."
5,Great visual learning aid,"I found this to be a helpful tool for my college anatomy and physiology class. Definitely get this book, it will help you recall items on tests more efficiently. If you want to know the kind of questions A and P teachers ask on tests get the following books:Anatomy and Physiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers with ExplanationsVol 1 ISBN: 0971999619Vol 2 ISBN: 0971999627These 3 sources should help you get good grades in your A and P class. My friends and I used them and we all did quite well."
3,"Very basic, but a good start","I teach Anatomy and Physiology at a community college, so this book was a little too basic and not detailed enough for the class that I teach. Great book for the high school aged or for general information."
5,Human Anatomy Coloring Book - lite,"fine for children, paraprofessionals (CNAs, FNPs, RN students), middle school students or quick review for medical professionals long after those Anatomy lectures are a distant memory. I used the original Anatomy Coloring Book during my 15 hours of gross anatomy in med school and I still have it 18 years later; for the investment in time and review it was worth the price. I bought the smaller version recently for my son who's in 7th grade and struggling with the way Human Anatomy is presented in his science class, so I gave him the book, went through parts of it with him, and he finds it a little more involved than the material presented (it's dumbed down, it's a PUBLIC school) which is the point. They don't have a textbook for home study/review; it's always better to have access to MORE information than less. Also got a copy for daughter, age 9, for later. A useful tool for reinforcing learning."
2,Wasn't crazy about it.,"I was looking for more information on anatomy and thought this would be helpful. For the depth that I needed it was not, however I WOULD recommend this book for a high school anatomy course."
3,Not enough information,"THe shipping was fast, however the coloring does not have enough information. It does have much details about bones and muscles.I will still order from this store though."
4,Ana coloring book,"This book took a long time to come but it arrived in the window of time, a little bent out of shape but good."
1,human being revieed,never received this product . never send me this items the order date is 2 month ago
2,Tools & Equipment chapter is thin and weak,"I was specifically looking for a book to help me choose and use installation and test equipment. Disappointed, I can learn more from equipment vendor web sites. As the author is British, so too is the terminology (""socket"" versus ""jack"") and pricing of equipment (Pounds circa December 1996). At 156 pages, the book is also quite thin for the price."
1,Try again WW,"I'd been running my players through my own Gehenna for years now. Imagine games that go on for 6+ hr's and it's counter move vs. counter move.Imagine my surprise when I heard WW was releasing a Gehenna book. I'll be honest...I thought the book would lack depth, and be callow in it's ""deconstruction"" of the Final Night's of Cain's children.So, I bought the book. I wasn't surprised by what I read. Many of the scenario's in the book are disappointing, and a few I found our right offensive because only Biblical lore was accounted for in the end of the world...such as the Wormwood scenario.What of Kindred that existed outside the Christian timeline, when ""God"" didn't exist, but Gods' did? I found much of the book insulting and shallow when compared to ANY (especially the WtA book, which was amazing!) of the TOJ books...In other words, don't buy this pile of steaming crap..."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Business is a bit slow for Thraxas, but he perks up a bit when he learns that the Sorcerers are meeting in the city to decide who should run their outfit.Thraxas, to quote, was 'as happy as an elf in a tree'. He knew that this would involve mayhem and murder, and as overflow, he was likely to get a job out of the whole situation."
4,Does what it's supposed to but has niggly issues,"This unit does everything I want but has caused a few side effects that are annoying. For example, I setup the bluetooth modem to see if I could get out through my BT cell phone.Now I get annoying pop-ups asking me if I want to dial-out that connection. Yes, I've gone through the internet options and set never-dial-a-connection. There are other little annoying side effects like a pop-up whenever my PC comes out of standby if the BT isn't plugged-in. I expect these issues may be true of most BT adapters so don't condem this unit. It's here FYI if you are new to Blue Tooth.All that said, I was pleased with the ease of setup, management and operation. The range I get with my BT devices (phone, palm T5, and plantronics discovery 645 is better than I had expected - maybe 15 or 20 feet before cut-out, 5 to 10 feet before degradation."
4,Clunky setup,"I bought this card to transfer files to my Motorola z6tv. It took a while and a re-ghost of my laptop but I figured out that the drivers that came with the device are out of date. When I downloaded the latest drivers I was able to connect to the phone and transfer files.It's a great device when you finally get it working, but it took a bit of playing around."
1,does not work,This product and its drivers do not work at all with the new windows vista or on my older computer with windows xp. I have tried two of these items with no sucess. Will never buy a Belkin product again!
5,Revealing information,"Although the first edition of this book was already published in 1986, it is still very much worth reading. It contains a lot of revealing information on subjects like the Masters of Wisdom, evolution and initiation, reincarnation, meditation and service. I found the chapter on reincarnation especially interesting. Benjamin Creme sees life and death as recurring phases in our eternal journey to perfection. He describes shortly the experiences after death and how the soul (our true being) will eventually reincarnate again in a new body. The process of reincarnation is an ordered process governed by various laws with a lot of beauty in it."
3,"Great In Most Respects, However...","Creme is a brilliant, compassionate man, and most of his message is great. However, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is not true. In fact, a more recent book has put forth the idea that the real Christ will not come again, and that real prophecy states that a message from the Spirit of Truth will guide us unto all truth, show us things to come, and glorify the Christ in heaven. And it states that the messenger is our brother and fellow servant who is from our midst and has the testimony of Jesus. He is not the Christ and not a superhuman, but a prodigal son of man who first suffered many things and was rejected by his generation, just as Jesus predicted. That's what is explained in Real Prophecy Unveiled, and it is a much more credible explanation of prophecy that foretells a future much like Creme envisions."
5,Excelent for Chemical Engineers,"This is an amazing book, specially for chemical engineers that work with Industrial Processes, and want one good book of control."
1,Whers the Patchouli,If your expecting the scent of Patchouli you will be disappointed nice soap seems very gentle to the skin but I wish it smelled better.
4,Perfect,At least one of these items I ordered (Patchouli) was something I can say smelt like Patchouli and was nice on the skin.
3,Not quite the classic patchouli aroma,"I was expecting a good patchouli smell, like that good stick incense from years past. This soap was OK but after a couple of uses it started smelling more minty; not bad, but not what I had hoped for."
3,loved the scent! but,wish it had lasted longer... no matter how hard I tried to keep the bar dry between showers it was gone in a flash!
2,ok,"really strong scent, i would say this is for men only. would not by for myself but my husband likes it."
5,Good product...,"I really like this soap. It has a very mellow and natural aroma. It's not too overpowering like some patchouli products. For people that like this aroma it will make you feel and smell good, and will fill your room with a nice smell. Try it. You can't go wrong."
1,not compatable with sony.,I get the same message as the other guys then the camera shuts down.. Weak.. Stuck with this thing now.
4,Great book,"Great book about server patterns foundation. This book show up several component patterns in a theoric way, but it converge to pratical way because much of theses patterns are found on web easily. For a programmer or analyst I recommend reading too EJB design patterns that's implementation of theses concepts."
4,Good addition,This is a good salve to have in the medicine cabinet. The scent is not overbearing. You will like this product.
5,Good product,We like this product. Great for muscle aches and all sorts of pain. The jar was quite large and will last a long time.
5,BEST NOVEL YET!!,"Wow! Mr. Brown what an outstanding piece of work. This is definitely a mainstay in my romance collection. This intriguing yet sophisticated tale of a black female who endures the ups and downs in several relationships speaks to the heart. It encompasses all the emotions of life. It has you teary-eyed one second and laughing till you hurt the next. I have read Dickey, Zane and Sister Souljah but this novel is the pinnacle of romance. GREAT BOOK, GREAT BUY!!! IF YOU DONT HAVE IT BUY IT NOW!!"
5,EXCELLENT!! TERRIFIC!! STOP HATING!!,Don't know what's wrong with those people over in the U.K. Neither of them have attempted to read the book but both are condemning him for marketing and promoting it in ALL circles. (And I mean ALL circles!!) Please!!! Read the book. I bought it right here on Amazon two weeks ago and let it sit for a week but when I picked it up I couldn't put it down!! It was that good to me. I'm a Black woman and I related quite well to almost everything he was writing about. Perhaps those that couldn't relate simply couldn't because of the racial or gender differences or both. Then again I'm pretty sure that most women who have been in relationships can relate as I did. After all pain and heartache are not limited to race. In any case read the book you'll love it and above all stop hating. There's too much of it in the world already. Write on Mr. Brown. It was good to me!!! Can't wait for the sequel!!
1,Mr. Brown is a spammer,Mr. Brown has been attempting to spam a UK single parent Yahoo group in order to promote his book. I certainly will not buy it!
2,Not complete,I was so disapointed in this DVD. It was NOT the complete opening ceremonies. They left out most of the drummers and several other segments. I thought the 2nd DVD would have more but was the parade of nations. What was shown was interesting but not the best quality.
1,Not the complete opening ceremonies!!!,"I didn't know that ""complete"" meant there would be parts completely cut out. I never caught it when it originally aired on NBC. The only reason I know parts are cut is because I watched the whole opening on Youtube. THERE ARE PARTS MISSING! AMAZING PARTS! I was hoping to see it on a big tv with great audio. I was wrong to expect anything half-decent from NBC, I suppose. It's a good thing I only borrowed this from my library and didn't waste any of my income on this garbage DVD."
1,disc 2 defective,Disc 2 defective - there are 2 copies of the parade of the athletes and no main program.
2,Received DVD today. Video is great!! Audio is a dissapointment.,"I received this DVD set today. Was waiting to see a great transfer from High Definition to NTSC. That's what I got. The video transfer was super crisp and in letterbox format so we got to see the entire frame. The audio, on the other hand, appears to be just 2 channel Dolby stereo, and sounds more like mono. (My DVD player shows it as Dolby 2.0.) Some passages have a tunnel effect like the 5.1 was mixed to one channel. TERRIBLE!!! I was expecting Dolby 5.1, if not DTS. I don't have hi-def at all, but to me, the audio makes the video!Come on ""Ten Mayflower,"" the company that produced this DVD set, how come it's only 2 channel and sounds like mono for the most of it??????I gave this review 2 stars because of the great video transfer, otherwise it would have received 1 star."
2,Disappointment in NBC Opening Ceremony DVD,"This DVD is exactly like NBC's US broadcast less commercials. With all those cameras you would think they could have included new footage and changed the perspectives. This is not the full 4-hour Opening Ceremony but portions of this magnificent program. Volume I is of the Opening and Volume II is of the athletes marching and Closing. I personally wanted more from Volume I and was disappointed and I think the at home viewer who wanted to see more than the TV broadcast will not be satisfied. It misses the full aura and the flow of this huge, stylized, one in a lifetime production. Must be nice to have the only licensed product."
1,Not good,In light of the event being probably the single most spectacularOlympics ceremony one is ever likely to see in this lifetime thisproduction is tragically bad.One would have thought they would have the consideration to topthe on air production by providing the extra footage you know they have.They should have provided alternate sound tracks so we could not have tosuffer with the NBC blathering and annoying commentary.I'm glad I viewed the original broadcast in Hi Def on my big screen and am extra glad I bothered to record the broadcast with my laptop/MM system.The DVD presentation falls flat after seeing it in HiDef.It is a damn pity NBC ruined this production.Not impressed and you would be better off finding bootleg hi def copy of the original broadcast.Stupid move nbc.
2,"""Blu Ray over Beijing""","Hopefully this dvd wil be available in Blu Ray version in the near future. Come on NBC/Universal, I know you're pressing now in Blu Ray (since the ""war"" is over)! It would look awesome in high definition; esp. the amount the Chinese spent on it. If it's going to be released on Blu Ray, maybe it'll have the complete ceremony, beginng and ending - more ""space"" in high def; also, absolutely in widescreen - I want to see the whole ""Bird's Nest""."
3,could be much better,"The Beijing Olympics opening ceremonies were fantastic, perhaps the most spectacular live event ever produced. However, if you have a HD TV and surround audio system, this DVD does not do justice to the show. The picture is muddy; noticeably worse than the HDTV over-the-air broadcast. The sound is flat (almost mono quality) and the rambling Bob Costas voice over cannot be turned off. If you can, rent the DVD instead. You probably won't want to watch it again unless a Blu-Ray version is released."
4,Amazing Spectacle,"Paid too much, as I ordered it as the 2012 Summer Olympics were beginning. Amazing production by the Chinese coordinators and participants. Same as what was shown on TV although the audio was slightly lacking. Seemed muffled, as has been noted by others. This wondrous event is well captured on this video. It does provide an Americanized view, but this does not subtract from this video of the 2008 Olympic Opening Ceremony."
4,2008 Beijing Olympic opening ceremony,"I purchased a dvd of the opening ceremony. The video quality was very good as I viewed it on my LG 42"" HD TV. However, the audio quality was not as good. The sound was not at a constant decibel level, it kept changing, low to high, med to high, high to low, etc. I had to constantly work the remote to adjust the sound level."
4,Overall pretty good.,It isn't the highest definition but it is a great price for some of the most awe-inspiring opening ceremonies of the modern Olympic era. It is organized and done by NBC who would be familiar to American viewers.
5,2008 Olympics Opening,Spectacular! Unbelievable. A must see! How wonderful that so many individuals contributed to the success of the Olympic Opening of the 2008 games. The people were so proud to have the games in their country and were delighted to perform and make the opening awsome for the world to see. The technology is better than anything we've seen to date. It would be overwhelming to be in London trying to work on something to compare.
1,Why No Blu-Ray?,It is a travesty that this spectacular event has not been released in full high-definition. I am baffled by this.
1,Are we sure?,"Only an observation based on the advertisement shown on Amazon.Whoever made this would have been smart to visit nbcdvd.com first since the jacket shown on this product is the one used by NBC on their 2008 Olympics HIGHLIGHT disc. In other words, this looks like a highlight disc, not the complete opening and closing ceremony disc.Frankly, that's why I skipped this product and moved on ... I want to be sure to get the correct content!"
1,dvd review-2008 Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremony,"I'm unable to review this product as I only received one of the 2 discs that should have been included with the purchase. I am extremely unhappy with the service I've received, or lack thereof, not only from the seller but mainly from Amazon and will no longer purchase another product in the future from your web site."
1,NOT what it claims,"well NBC should be taken to court for false advertisement. firstly the actual running time is NOT as stated on the box 4 hours but 3 hrs. 25 min. that is not a MINOR error.second the full opening is N shown. we do get the ultimately boring march of nations, which quite frankly I could have done with out or maybe 10 min of that would suffice, but why have that in lieu of the FULL and awesome opening acts. it is a shame and a rip off.So title is false too, it is NOT the full opening.I would say tech quality of DVD is excellent."
1,Where's The Good Stuff?,"I can't believe it. The world watches this wonderful event in HDTV and what do they give us? This? What did anyone hope to gain by making this available in standard DVD with standard resolution. Everything, including the sound, just runs together on this wholly uninspiring rendition. It would have been better had they just not made it available, period."
2,Great imagination and scope; poor presentation,"I was out of the country, so I missed the initial presentation. While this is better than nothing, I agree that the discs are inferior. Low bit rate, mediocre sound, no CC or subtitles, no ability to remove the often disruptive commentary of Bob Costas, et al. This is an artistic accomplishment helmed by the great film director Yimou Zhang (also responsible for the impressive Forbidden City ""Turandot""), and it does not need endless wall-to-wall sports commentary (come to think of it, sports coverage seldom needs endless blather, either). And, add insult to injury, that obtrusive NBC logo is permenently inset in the upper right hand corner (hope you don't have a generation 1 plasma). Why these guys couldn't go back to the raw feed to create a more satisfying home theatre experience is beyond me. It does seem just another way to make a quick buck from NBC home video."
2,Disappointing,1 Question.... What was the point of broadcasting it in HD if youre going to sell it on a regular DVD? The quality is horrible...
1,Not Complete and Not HDTV,I'm going to return this awful item. Not only is it not the complete NBC Coverage it is not High Definition. It is most likely taken by video camera from some tv in California and had the commercials edited out!
4,Glorious Spectacle!,"2008 Olympics Opening Ceremony, the history of China told in all its colorful and soaring splendor, is amazing. The rest of the DVD is the parade of athletes, if you like that sort of thing after seeing it on TV."
5,dazzling DVD,"I don't know why all the negative reviews of this DVD. I have a 55-inch HD Sony TV. I watched the Summer Olympics in HD and I bought the DVD version and played it on my Sony up-convert DVD player. Both presentations looked dazzling. I have over 2,000 DVDs in my collection so I've watched tons of DVDs. I wonder if these people played the DVD on up-convert DVD players or not. And I assume that they used HDMI cables to hook up the up-convert DVD player to their HD TV.I just purchased a BluRay player this Christmas so I will be waiting for a BluRay version of the opening ceremonies. For now I'm very satisfied with the quality of the DVD."
2,Good ideas but small on illustration,"This book would have been a show stopper if it had been illustrated with every idea the author put forward. There are some good ideas that I was able to utilize, but as the other reviewers have noted, it's hard to get too excited about a line drawing and a list of colors."
2,It leaves you wanting more.......,"I am a big McMurty fan, I have read all four of the books (Dead Man's Walk, Comanchee Moon, Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo). Out of interest I decided to purchase all the movies (Comanchee Moon is not out yet though).... Dead Man's Walk is true to the storyline of the book. That's about as nice of a comment I can make about the movie. I feel generous giving it two stars even. The musical score is dreadful, and despite the storyline occuring in the wide open the movie feels cramped visually. The acting is so poor it makes one wonder how the big name stars in it ever became famous. The corny acting is embarassing to watch through most of it. The movie is slower then a hot afternoon in Lonesome Dove. I suppose if you are a fan of McMurtry it should be watched, just to say you did, but if you have anything else pressing to do I wouldnt waste the time."
3,Dead Man's Walk (VHS),"A good, not a great, made for TV movie. The ""prequel"" to the Lonesome Dove mini-series. The script and acting are uninspireing and awkward. It pales in comparison to the original Lonesome Dove which is very high standard to approach for both story, stars, and acting."
2,Slow and depressing,"This movie was agonizingly slow and depressing. If you like good westerns, stay away from this one."
4,A great western with a great cast!,"I really enjoyed this movie. I really enjoyed the unique plot and the wide ranging cast from everyone to F. Murray Abraham, Johnny Lee Miller, David Arqutte, Jennifer Garner Etc. I orginally watched this movie because I am a big fan of F. Murray Abraham, I really enjoyed him in the role of the villian. This is also the first movie I really ever saw Jennifer Garner in, so it is fun to see her young as well. I really liked Miller and Arqutte's portrayal of the two main characters, I thought it was very well done.The only complaint I have about this movie is that it is pretty violent, and many of the minorarty characters ( native Americans and Mexicans) are not portrayed with respect. Maybe this was because who the main characters were and thier association with peoples of these cultures...I don't know.Anyway, if you are looking for a good western, try this one!"
2,Boring and slow,This series is a big let down when Larry McMurtry normally has such action packed and drama filled series. The acting is very poor. Don't waste your money on this one!
3,Disappointing,"Gus McCrae's character seems all wrong in this movie. The only scenes with Gus that work are the ones that include Clara. Clara is just right. . Mr. Miller does a great job as Woodrow, all repressed emotion. Matty is too young, so that maternal issues in the book aren't really explored here. The ending though is more satisfactory than the one in the book."
1,Dead Man's Walk,"This movie is average if you like westerns. although realistic, it was nothing more that sorrow,pain and trouble throughout the picture.It is a true example of ""HUMAN SUFFERING"" at it's finest.If you like good movies...Stay away from this one!"
1,Give me a break,"Very disappointing. Terrible script and worse acting. Keith Carradine is god awful making many of his lines seem like very bad adlibs (typical). One of the exceptions is Harry Dean Stanton who does a credible job.Costuming and the sets are goodShame on Artisan and Hallmark for trying to get mileage out of their great Lonesome Dove series with this piece of dung. This story could have and should have been much better delivered. As presented, this should be an embarassment to Larry McMurtry."
2,Deadman's Walk,"I love Lonesome Dove, and bought this used VHS as a last resort when I couldn't find a DVD. It said it was in like new condition. Not hardly. While watchable, the tape had some real tracking issues, especially at the top of the screen, which is typically a hallmark of a tape played nearly unto death."
5,great movie,"It's hard to compare to the original ""Lonesome Dove"" but this movie is a great story of Gus and Call in thier younger years as Texas Rangers and the loves that crossed thier path . Recommended 10 times over !!"
3,From one who was there.,"I worked in the filming of the movie here in Fort Davis, Texas and surrounding areas...(albeit as an extra). The director and crew tried real hard to meet the standards of Lonesome Dove and even Larry M. showed on the set. However the calibre of acting e.g. Lonesome Dove's Robert Duvall et. al., I don't think was ever met. A great deal of the exciting action scenes and great west Texas backgrounds ended up on the cutting room floor. The final, released product that made it to a short mini series on television was, alas, a far cry from a worthy successor to the wonderful ""Lonesome Dove"". That's just my opinion, I could be wrong. :o)"
1,DO NOT BUY A DAAVEEDEE,"DAAVEEDEE is completely unwilling to work w/ you on ANYTHING. I have never purchases ANYTHING on Amazon and not been completely satisfied until I purchased a DVD from them. Granted I order a DVD in the incorrect language but am unable to return it. Its the dumbest thing I have ever heard of! Maybe they should put the entire product desription in Swedish since only Swedish speaking people can watch it! If the dvd is in English, it should be WRITTEN IN ENGLISH! IF THE PRODUCT IS IN SWEDISH, IT SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN SWEDISH!!!!"
2,tiny,"the teapot is very cute but it is tiny! It says 2 cups, but it is more like half cup. So, it is not very useful."
2,This is not a 2 cup teapot and infuser,"2 cups is 16 oz and there's no way this pot holds 16 ounces, I know cause I measured the water. I was very disappointed with the contents of the pot. I liked the pot well enough but it's not large enough. No I won't send it back."
5,Great cologne!,"My husband is always looking for something different, and loves it. I'm a big fan of demeter fragrance, and it was nice to be able to get my huband one too!"
4,A Valiant Effort,"You have to give Ian Wilson credit for writing a book like this- obviously, he is going to cop it from either skeptics or believers no matter what he says on this most controversial of subjects. In my opinion, Wilson does an excellent job of giving a fair and objective appraisal of the evidence, steering a highly readable middle course that avoids the extemes of dry conservatism and faddish sensationalism. A revised edition of this book came out in 1996, in which Wilson's Christian beliefs are more obvious (the evidence that *something* very strange happened that first Easter, is surprisingly stubborn) Will leave you thinking.."
4,"Useful, worthwhile read","Up front, Wilson informs the reader of any personal bias he may hold (he is a believing Christian) and why he produced a second edition (in response to those who think him too skeptical and recent archaelogical evidence that has since become available for analysis). Wilson examines key questions surrounding the life and divinity of Jesus in a particular form. Chapters are geared toward answering a single question, such as ""what do we know of Jesus' birth or upbringing?"" Each chapter begins critically with skeptical arguments summarized, followed by what Wilson views as contradictory evidence. Most importantly, chapters conclude with a summation which invariably reveal Wilson as the Christian that he is. I can see this format as lending itself well toward ""Jesus: The Evidence"" being a handy reference source should a specific question about Jesus' life pop up at a future instance. At the very least this book worked for me in establishing Jesus as a true historical figure."
5,A Broad-minded approach to a difficult subject!,"The author presents a well documented, rational, & unbiased view of a controversial topic, which allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. Very easy, yet spellbinding to read. Such a shame it's out-of-print! Also well worth reading:anything by Geza Vermes, & ""James, The Brother of Jesus"", by Robert Eisenman."
5,The original Golden Boy - Chicano Power,"If you like old movies and were ever involved in the ""movimiento"" you will most certainly like this movie. For those Latinos who think the struggle is new you may be surprised. It's a simple movie with deep overtones. It will make you angry and also make you laugh. This movie is a gem I accidently came across. I bought it because the price was right and I'm glad I did. I'm an older dude from the old school so It was easy for me to relate to this movie. Considering the time it was filmed I'm surprised it was ever released. It is a politically charged movie designed to make you think."
2,Loose Ends--Too Many,"The film has some scary moments, but there are all too many loose ends. One walks away with many questions; poor overall plot with lots of unexplained happenings. I've seen much better."
2,Tries to do too much...and often not well,"While well-written and clear, too much of this book is spent on ancillary topics (like world history and how to play office politics) and not enough on enterprise and systems architecture techniques. I was also quite surprised and disappointed at the authors' naive approach to project maangement, which goes hand-in-hand with enterprise and architecture efforts. Either the interface of PM to EA should be expanded, or not mentioned at all. In total, a disappointment..."
3,"elementary, long-winded and off-topic","Apparently this is a student textbook aimed at the freshman level. It's full of long, off-topic ""asides"", vocabulary lists and cartoons that have nothing to do with the Zachman Framework, but are intended as a very elementary background to the general field of business.I opened the book at random and found as a typical example:Physical symptoms of culture shock include:* Too much or too little sleep* Eating too much or having no appetite at all* Frequent minor illness* HeadachesThis sort of thing goes on for nearly seven hundred pages. Only a couple of pages directly address the Zachman Framework.I ordered the book before it was published and chewed through a couple of chapters before deciding that it wasn't worth any more of my time. I did skip read through the rest of it to make sure there's nothing of value here. There isn't."
2,Verbose introduction to subject but lacks depth,"I have been a business systems analyst for many years and used some elements of the Zachman framework succesfully in fairly cutting edge projects. I was hoping to gain a deeper perspective across the whole framework (all 36 cells) to round out my understanding and to provide additional techniques and methods I could use.Unfortunately the book wholly failed to meet this expectation. I think it is worth 2 stars for introducing people to the overall concepts of the Zachman Framework, but don't expect any useful methods that can be applied in practice.The Zachman Framework IS the defintive approach to enterprise systems architecture, but unfortunately there is still scant practical resources available for practicioners."
1,Not much content,"The book is supposed to be for business administration students who don't know anything about computers. The trouble is that is doesn't contain much about business either. It's like the sociology books you get in high school, lots of words and no real content.The Zachman Framework is a BUFD (Big Up Front Design) methodology used by the government, but almost nobody else these days. Private industry dropped it, because it's too cumbersome for the value it delivers - just like this book."
1,Not a happy customer,"I ordered this twice. The description clearly states that the price is for a 6-pack of 2-roll cards, a total of 12 rolls. The first time I ordered, I received one two-roll pack. I contacted amazon.com and they refunded my cost and told me to re-order, which I did. The second time, I again received one pack of two rolls. This time I contacted the seller, who responded that amazon was changing the description AFTER THE SALE. This is patently untrue -- the description both before and after the sale clearly indicated a 6-pack. I've now spent two weeks trying to get 12 rolls of tape, and I still don't have them. I am not a happy customer."
1,Disappointing edition,"I was searching for a copy of the Folger edition of the play, and this version came up. Text for the product described it as the Folger edition with notes on the facing page and articles on the text. Cover wasn't the same as other Folger editions but the price was good and I needed a copy of the text in a hurry before going out of the country. So I went ahead and purchased it, thinking I'd be getting the standard Folger annotated edition, but that wasn't the case. Book is published by Simon and Brown NOT Folger, and it contains text only -- no articles or notes. Did not have time to return the item and shipping it back would have cost as much as I paid. Oh well. Caveat emptor. The first time I've been disappointed by an Amazon purchase..."
2,Battle of the sexes my ass,"I have so many problems with this play, I don't even know where to begin. The thing that is the hardest to realize about Shakespeare is that the word ""comedy"" doesn't mean humor. It means the play ends with someone getting married. But to assume this means it ends happily is an ignorant modern notion.There's tons of feminist criticism about this play, with the central question being this; Is Katherine pleased at the end because she's actually been tamed, or do her and her man both have a secret understanding that they're manipulating everyone around them and that's why she's enjoying herself?Of course I think either argument is irrelevant because in order to get Kate tamed, her ""husband"" starves her and keeps her from sleep until she learns to do whatever he says regardless of how degrading or silly.So no. I'm not a fan. Not even a little bit. I know it's a product of the times it was written in, but I don't think that justifies me liking it."
4,Decent overview,"With all due respect I disagree with the Corvallis writer.. I used the book during my postgarduate studies and it is a decentintro into surface science. It does assume knowledge of crystallography, thermodynamics, atomic physics, and basic experimental surface study techniques; therefore it is not all that useful for undergrads in general.Thomas..."
1,Horrid...,"As a chemistry student trying to learn surface science, this book has done nothing but frustrate me. From the author's use of antiquated units, to horrid question writing, to lousy explanations, I would rather go into a laboratory blind than have this book guide me. To sum up, find another book if you aren't already an expert!"
5,My Dogs Love It and So Do I !!,"Works like a charm. My dogs will actually go over the The Vittles Vault and wait for me to open it up because they want to eat right out of the container. The food is so fresh its like they can smell the aroma when the lid comes off. And the food stays nice and fresh. No dry kibble. The lid spins really nicely, I can open and close with one hand. I hope the next one I buy is going to be as nice. I have a Koi pond and want to put the bulk fish food in it."
4,Great Container,"Very compact, seals well, I'm very happy with it. It holds the whole bag of dogfood, and is very convenient."
4,Dog food storage,"Great seller, but this item lid does not fit like our straight on top lids, which we love. Also would suggest the next larger as this will not hold an entire bag of 40# Science Diet."
1,Don't bother!,I use to draw the instructional sewing diagrams for 3 well know pattern companies. I know how to sew very well and I have to say that this book is very hard to follow. It is frustrating trying to find the actual pattern that goes with the beautiful dress in the photo. It's confusing and step by step instructions just don't exist. It seems to be written by someone who knows how to sew well but has no idea how to teach.It is basically a pretty picture book.I don't have the time or patience to go on a scavenger hunt through the book to find the separate patterns to piece together an actual outfit. Do yourself a big favor and pass this book by!
1,Back to the drawing board,"If you're looking to dress chubby dolls or big baby dolls, this isn't the book for you. If you're looking for simple, direct, and reliable, don't look here either.If you're looking to dress your Bleuette from the patterns for 11"" dolls this book supposedly contains, look elsewhere, unless you wish to dress her in a nappy and a bunny suit, because that's all you'll find for your 11"" kids.The book is laid out in a complicated and frustrating way. There are photographs of wonderful outfits, line drawings of outfits, and paragraph after paragraph about the history of each variation, but you have to search for the page that tells exactly WHICH pattern pieces to use to get the same look. Only after one such frustrating search did I discover collars and cuffs in their own separate chapter.The pattern pieces are way too small unless you're dressing very slim dolls. And don't take anything on faith - measure everything, including your doll and all the pattern pieces you plan to use."
1,Threw it across the room,"I have another vote for the pretty picture book/ useless otherwise. Side note- I have been sewing for 27 yrs.- There isn't one pattern in here that fit the doll I was making it for. Even the crochet pattern for the matinee jacket ended up being dismantled, as it would've perhaps fit an 8 inch doll, not the 15 inch baby doll it was supposed to! Well OK, maybe they were Birtish crochet directions, but it still shouldn't've been that tiny! You can look at the picture & see how loosey goosey it was crocheted, & with an 8 hook? I don't think so! The only reason I didn't burn this book when I started ripping the pages out was because I want the shoe section. Otherwise, I am making my own patterns again!!! What a waste of my precious time."
4,OK book.,"Good instructions, a bit dated, but dolls never go out of style....... The fit of the clothing is not well emphasised and should be. This is something you have to do for yourself. No one pattern will fit precisely. Do your own tucking and fitting. Good book"
3,You get what u pay for,This build was fun and easy but I was a little disappointed with the little amount of articulation it has but still a good buy
2,2 Years later need to replace,"Just like others have said, Teflon flakes and worthless after short period of use. I've had these for less then 2 years and have always hand washed with no metal utensils. These were great at first but now useless. I could've bought a $59.99 set and got the same use out of them (my last set was, and lasted longer!)"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Have had this set since late May, 2012. Have only used occasionally - only once or twice each pan...The non-stick coating is coming off in my food! And the hard anodized exterior is turning all white and 'chalky' looking.Have only washed by hand and used utensils specifically made for non-stick cookware.Lifetime warranty? I guess their idea of a lifetime is different than mine!"
1,Never again!,"I expected better from Cuisinart. I purchased this set as a gift for my wife and she is not happy! Not dishwasher safe, easily sratched, horrible value. The coating is flaking off, the cookwear looks like its 10 years old already and they have been used for less than a month. Do not waste your money!"
4,Great Non-Stick Pans for the Price,"I love these pots and pans!After looking extensively online, I found that this set was the best quality and best selection of pans for the price. I use frying-pans more than I do saucepans, so I love that this set comes with 2 smaller frying pans, and 2 larger, deeper pans with lids.The only downsides : 1) hand-wash only, 2) they scratch very easily, so be sure to use wooden or plastic utensilsOverall - Fantastic set of durable, non-stick pans for the price; I highly recommend them!"
5,Perfect,My husband is the cook in the family and this Christmas present was perfect. The sizes of the dishes are great - sometimes they can be smaller than pictured. The deep fry pan has been a real treat for him as he can now fry up a lot of things he's been wanting to try. Washes up great!
4,Good basic set of cookware,"If you're looking for a good basic set of pots and pans, this Cuisinart 17 piece set can perform almost all cooking functions. The non-stick interiors work well and the anodized exteriors are pretty easy to clean. My only disappointment was that the cookware was lighter weight than I expected, but so far it has functioned pretty well for making sauces, soups, pastas and sauteing various vegetables. It might be wise to supplement this set with a heavier cast iron or enamel pot."
3,Very pretty,"This is not a set for a large family as the pots and pans are small to medium. It is great for a one or two person family though. Very pretty and I love the grooved bottoms. So far, nothing I have cooked has stuck to the pans."
5,nsgfaye,I am more than pleased with this product. It is 95% of the cook wear that i will ever need. It holds the heat well which results in well prepared meals. I love this set and I am telling everyone who will listen how much I love it and recommending it to all my friends.
5,Beautiful.,This set is gorgeous and easy to clean and works wonders on the stovetop. I highly recommend these pots and pans to anyone who loves to cook.
4,Great Value,We bought these pans to replace an old set of Calphalon that was getting worn out. These pans are working great they are thinner than the Calphalon hopefully they will last as long as the Calphalon did. If so they will be great. They are a lot lighter this might help some people that have problems handling heaver pans. They also heat up a lot faster. I burned the first thing I tried to make but I have gotten use to the fact that they heat up a lot faster than the Calphalon I was use to cooking on.
4,Beautifully made - great value!,Great balance and quality craftsmanship. The number of items in this set is also astounding. I don't know why it took me so long to toss my very old and sad looking Calphalon and upgrade to something so nice. I'm very happy with this purchase!
4,Lots of Pieces to this set!,"I like this set it has a whole lot of pieces, more than you would usually get. I use it only on medium to low heat and it cooks wonderfully. Only thing I don't like about it, is it isn't really stackable. I don't have a lot of cabinet space. It takes up more than what I expected. I would recommend this product."
4,Worth the money,"I searched the reviews and contemplated for several weeks before I purchased this set. I wanted a good quality product for a great price that had everything I needed. This set fit the bill. I have been using the cookware now for over a month and I am extremely pleased. The pans heat evenly, cook things quickly and clean up is a breeze. The 9 quart stockpot is a little tall, but I love the pasta insert. The only negative I have for this set is....make sure you have lots of room in your cabinet to store them. I don't have much room. But I lined my cabinet with nonslip liner to keep the pots and pans from getting scratched. I have a few small scratches on the outside of my pans already because they brush up against each other as I put them away. Also make sure the utensils have zero metal on them. I used one spatula that was rubber tipped, but the handle was metal. The handle left a small scratch on the lip of my saute pan. Overall, great set."
5,Best Cookware om Market,I recently brought this set after buying new glass top stove.I had a Calphalon that costed way more than the Cuisinart set. This set is beautiful heavy handles that can go in oven and clean up is so easy. You can not go wrong with this set I Love them and only going to buy Cuisinart products Why PAY more for less I did when I brought Calphalon Never again J. Johnson
3,Inexpensive non-stick cookware,"Nice, inexpensive cookware that seems of high quality. Easy to cook with and easy to clean. Only negative is that glass lids (with metal handles) get hot when used. One must use a towel, hot pads or oven mitts to safely remove lid when in use."
3,Made in China,The cookware is good. I'm distressed it's made in China though. If I had known this before I had ordered it I would have bought another product.
1,Junk. Cause cancers.,"I bought my set in 2008. My frying pans were first to go. I had to toss them since they started to tear off the black particles from the surface. They only lasted about a year. Then, I started to notice other pods had black particles coming off from the surface too. I read online that these black particles would cause cancers. STAY AWAY.I had to get rid of the entire set up until now and bought another cookware set. This set just helped me waste my money."
5,LOVE IT!,"I love these pots and pans! I would def. recommend them to a friend. They are nice and thick and for once I actually dont have to use butter or oil to keep food from sticking. They cook quickly, and are very sturdy!"
2,The keys are all identical across all units,"I bought one for each of my sons, thinking they would each have their own private key. Unfortunately, the keys are identical, just a flap of metal to turn the release mechanism. That would be OK if buying only one, but I wanted each to be different, so they're going back. I may buy adult lock boxes with padlocks. Oh, and I have to say, ""Must accept any color"" == LAME.Update: For about the same price, I bought 2 SentrySafe CB12's. SentrySafe can make real cash boxes, with real keys, much larger (increased material cost), and sell for about the same price. A way better deal, and the kids love their ""grown-up"" cash boxes. LOL Seriously, don't you long for the day when you could get excited over something that small?SentrySafe CB12 Large Cash Box, BlackThe big ones also have room for books, small toys, etc."
1,Toysmith Kids Cash Box,So disappointed. I thought there would be separate compartments for change and bills. Just one big lift-out. Box is not even wide enough for a bill. You have to fold the bills in half. Another 1/2 inch and at east the bills could lay flat. Not what we expected.
3,Cash box,"I bought 2 of these for my boys 5 and 7. They love that they have their own combination. Keys have not worked. Nice start to saving money in their own bank. Color choice is random, but I lucked out with 2 different colors."
3,My nephew loves this!,"This is smaller than what I pictured, so I was disappointed. However, this so happens to be one of my 8 yr old nephews' favorite things. A great simple toy?, that most young boys will appreciate."
5,Blast from my Past,This is my favorite Christmas special. I was so glad when I found it. I am extremely satisfied.
1,"Do Not Purchase, Awful Quality and Possible Copyright Infrigement","How can Amazon sell a DVD that is clearly a copy, not even an original and has quality issues and is a DVD-R? This seems like a huge copyright infringement to me and also extremely illegal. How can anyone pass this off as an actual distributor produced DVD is beyond me. I was excited to see this title available but extremely disappointed when I went to play the movie and it wouldn't play in most of my DVD players. What a rip-off. Buyers - steer clear of this item. Anyone from Hanna Barberra reading this - I'd start looking into what other items Amazon is selling that are bootleg copies."
3,Yogi quality,"Although the movie is great , the quality was not very good. I rated the quality as a 1 of 5."
3,"A little better than ""OK""","No reason to waste any time on a description of the movie itself; the product description does a more-than-adequate job of that.This was better than I had been expecting and better-written than most of the Hanna-Barbera classic Christmas cartoons that I've seen. While poor, the animation actually exceeds what I've seen of other cartoons of the period (1980).The run time is incredibly long--more than an hour and a half--and that was the big shocker of the whole deal. I actually would have been happier with this had it run maybe 15 or 20 minutes shorter.Another thing missing from this presentation is DVD extras. There are absolutely none. What I love aboutA Flintstones Christmas Carolis that there are some great extras, including a Christmas episode of the series itself (not a special). Something like that packaged with this would have added a lot of value.Overall, this is a solid offering and worth a look."
2,Yogis First Christmas,The DVD did not work. It was all srambled and I could not watch it. My wife purchased 2 others and they all had the same problem!
2,Yogi's first christmas!,I could not hear it because I'am hearing Impaire Watching Yogi's First Christmas was like watching a silent movie! you people never think of the hearing impaired!! or just don't want to be bothered w/it which would mean u don't care about us
1,Worst Show Ever!!!!!!!!!,"These women should be ashamed of themselves, they give a bad name to women everywhere. The disrespect they have for each other and other women is sad and pathetic. Money can buy them a lot of things, but they'll never be able to buy class."
4,I NEEDED MORE!,"Jennifer is worth over 30M, I needed more from her! Evelyn has a new book deal with Cash Money!!!!!!!!! So u know Baby is paying her 6#s!!!! Waiting for her book, about those nasty dudes in ""The industry""....."
3,"WELL MADE SHOE, BUT.......","I really wanted to give this shoe 4 stars, these shoes look great. They are water resistant, slip resistant, and very well made. But they do not fit like the walking shoes that I bought by the same company. I have a high arch, and these shoes do not. I tried the ""Mosaic"" customization with only minor improvement. Now I have a used product that can not be returned. So I went to my local drug store and bought reg athletic shoe inserts, and presto!!! Much better fit. I just thought for the price I paid, that they should fit better right out of the box."
5,A beautifully done realistic coming-of-age tale.,"The real-life answer to the gushy, cutesy, incredibly over-anthropomorphised ""The Lion King"". This is a stunningly photographed documentary recording the growth to adulthood of a leopard cub. Its wonderful musical score adds immeasurably. This is a work of art.This is great children's fare for any parent that is not too squeamish to admit that carnivores eat real animals, that meat is muscle that once belonged to a critter like us, and that other animals have a different but valid social structure and value system of their own. Our 3-year-old loves this movie, as do the rest of the family."
5,the leopard son,excellent video glad I was able to obtain it. also have the soundtrack. Beautiful photography reminds me of another great animal film Duma.
3,contrived,"the cinematography is impressive, and some of the shots are really interesting and beautiful... however it is my opinion that much of the narration line is contrived and not actually representitive to the footage... i think they implied certain circumstances that were not actually happening... also very anthomophized... but again also some great footage"
4,Bring your Hankie,"If you like Animal Planet, you're a sucker for this tale. It is quite remarkable in story, as well as the amazing closeups of leopards in all sorts of activities. An unvarnished, straightforward telling, I think it should be fascinating to all age groups, even quite young children."
2,Anthropomophized Leopard sends wrong message,"This film had some decent cinematography, but it was edited in such a way as to create a contrived story that has little or no similarity to an actual leopard's life. The narration mythicalizes the leopard's existence, and the story revloves around comparing the leopard's journey through life to that of human maturation.By portraying non-human life as somthing that is human, filmmakers patronize the organism(s) that are being represented. This film, pitched as a ""real-life lion king"", is a poor example of Natural History film. Those who wish to appreciate and respect leopards and other forms of non-human life that are represented through film and video should avoid this film. It merely provides a cozy narrative within which humans can ""identify"" with the leopard; simplifiying its existence so that it is easily consumed by viewers who want a happy story."
3,"Not a great Jawbreaker album, but still OK","Definitely the most disappointing Jawbreaker album. Gone is the intensity of ""Unfun"" and the emotion of ""24 Hour Revenge Therapy"". In it's place is major label slickness. Toned down vocals which just don't do the music justice. What makes this album is the typcial Jawbreaker catchy pop punk melodies. Not much in the way of a Jawbreaker album but 10 times better than the Green Day and NOFX clones. Too bad they had to go out on such a low note."
5,My favorite album ever by anyone,"This album means so much to me. I have been buying all kinds of music for years...I have such a big collection...but this one remains my favorite. It got me through high school and now it's helping me through college. The lyrics are incredibly multi-layered and the delivery is both powerful and soft. The music is tough and crunchy one second, sadly beautiful the next. A classic...a masterpiece...very very very very underrated. You could say the songs are about heartbreak, but you can apply them to all aspects of life. Every song is perfect. Great recording quality. So good."
5,Dear You = Heartbreak's got a soundtrack,"From the picture of the ass with the words, ""Dear You"" underneath to the lyrics, ""if you hear this song a hundred times it still won't be enough"" Jawbreaker's final album remains their finest & most focused piece of work. Anyone who's ever been stepped on or even done a bit of stepping themselves will find their minds floating through memories & emotions all to the breakbeat power pop playing and that blatant ""here's what i feel, deal with it"" vocal stylings coming from one very abused (and yet full functioning)throat belonging to the one & only Blake (now of Jets To Brazil fame.)One could write a novel on the influence this one album had on the entire indie/ punk music scene, but what's the point? Just listen."
5,Go out and do something!,Great stories of real people today who took a look at the world and didn't like what they saw. So they did something about it. Biggs is a great storyteller.
1,"""Best Book in History of English Language""?!?!","Wow, some of you people need to read a bit more broadly. Jeepers, this is the sort of maudlin claptrap that gives maudlin claptrap such a bad name. Brave hearts, rebel spirits, lots of cheap slogans and smarmy cliches and uplifting tales of grrl power and similar blather are a good example of why people think Americans are so stupid, and Mrs. R is certainly closer in spirit to a typical American housewife than anyone I've ever known from the UK."
4,perfect for ironman watch,"This is the third one of these I have, all for ironman watches. Perfect for watches in my referee bag"
4,Wonderful,Why aren't more people reading Baxter? These wonderful stories are so moving they hold weight against writers like Cheever and Englander. Each is exquisitely wrought and powerful. A true master of craft...and (finally) suspense!
2,Wrong ORDER,"I bought this guitar for my husband last Christmas... unfortunately, they sent the wrong guitar and I had to give it to him a week early b/c their return/exchange policy is so restricted and finite. We ended up returning and not exchanging because of their unwillingness to be flexible during to holiday season with regards to returns and exchanges. Also, the wrong colored guitar had a BIG scuff mark on it and it took FOREVER and several emails (they don't have a phone system) for the company to refund my money. As for the quality... I couldn't tell you."
5,"Toshiba 32"" Cinema Series Television","This television really impressed me with it's large number of available options and, mosre importantly, the number and variety of video inputs. The picture quality impressed me as well as the ability to adjust the color temperature. Overall I'm very impressed with this set and highly recomend it."
2,In a word: Disappointing,"I found the first book very intriguing, and was anxious to read Hidden Family as soon as I could.It was certainly an ambitious undertaking for the author, with lots of different plots popping up and teasing the reader....but most of these plots weren't fully fleshed out, and the ending of the book was very pat, with things wrapped up quite hastily. I definitely feel like the story was rushed, and a lot of moments were glossed over or missed completely.The ending was a COMPLETE disappointment. I understand that not every book has a happy ending. Fine. But the sad event at the end of this book didn't even have any great emotional resonance. I, who cry at the drop of a hat, was left feeling robbed and cheated, not teary and empathetic.I am sad to report that Hidden Family was very much a disappointment; I wish the author could do a rewrite, maybe add 300 more pages and do the story right.Oh well...."
3,Fun adventure,"I thought that the Hidden Family was a fun sci-fi adventure. The concept of an extended family capable of walking between worlds has been done before (Nine Princes in Amber, etc.), but Stross uses the concept well in telling an action-packed original story with interesting characters."
1,Stop now - this series goes very far downhill,"The books in this series are not very separated from each other, so there's no good place to stop - and stop you should. I don't mind blitzing through some dull spots in a series, but this series is heading for a really dreadful ending. It's not just that what happens in the sixth book is horrible, but that it's described in pornographic detail. I feel cheated - as if I'd started watching a romance movie, and found I was watching a snuff flick instead.Read the other negative reviews and believe them - I wish I had."
4,An enjoyable continuation of the first book,"The Hidden Family is an enjoyable continuation of the first book in the series,The Family Trade (Merchant Princes). These books are about ""world walkers"" who have the inborn ability to travel between alternative worlds. The characters and the worlds are well drawn. The economic and scientific problems in the various worlds are explored. If you liked The Family Trade, I think that you will enjoy this book. As I note in my review of the third book (The Clan Corporate: Book Three of The Merchant Princes), I'd stop with these too."
2,Stross loves cliffhanger endings,"I've bought and read all of the books in this series. The story line is pretty good, but the author loves cliffhanger endings. I won't be buying any more in this series."
3,Quality fluff,"This is good fantasy. Which is to say, it is a little lame, but it is good lame. If you need a book to get you through the subway ride, this is a great candidate."
3,Hard to believe Stross wrote this,From anyone else this would be a decent addition to the series; however it's hard to believe the compelling voice of Accelerando and Singularity Sky is boring me with the niggling details of Miriam's clothing. I enjoyed the first Merchant Prince but it seems like the author did not invest all his considerable talents in this one.
3,"It's okay, I guess",I bought this because I had a firewire CF card reader and wanted the fastest download speeds possible for photos. This doesn't seem any faster than USB 2.0. And it sure cost a lot more.
4,Four Confederate Soldiers,"Readers who are interested in American history, or are Civil War buffs, or just want a good read, will be very pleased with this compelling book by Jack Rogers. Mr. Rogers has done a lot of research on his subjects, and he brings them to life in an informative and entertaining manner. An additional plus is the important genealogical material that he provides. Those tracking their ancestors may find similar migration patterns for their lines to those of Rogers's family branches. I am delighted to have found this book, and wholeheartedly recommend it."
1,Don't buy this!!,The plug easily slips out from the cigarette lighter socket. The cables at the movable part breaks...
5,What a wonderful book,"This is an excellent book for Christians'. This book will show you how to spread the gospel to everyone. If you have ever wanted to witness to someone and didn't know how, this is the book for you. You will be amazed at the author's witnessing accounts. He will show you how to witness and how not to give up. You will be able to relate to him in so many ways. He gives you effective scripture to help spread the gospel. This book is truly amazing. You will get on fire for the Lord Jesus Christ. This author has truly shown me how to witness to other people. I believe this book will truly help everyone who wants to spread the gospel."
5,Advanced theories and in depth writing,"this book provides insightful, advanced theories and in depth writing on art therapists observation, interaction, and analysis with patients of psychosis. Great material for course adoption. highly recommended!"
5,Helpful reminder of where Art Therapy comes from.,"I found the book very solid. It felt like sitting with my back against a strong trunk of a tree, a much needed sensation on the sparse ground of Art Therapy."
4,AMERICA'S GREAT AVENUES,"This is a very good book on a most deserving subject. I especially liked the section on Galveston's Broadway, but all of the avenues are most derserving. I really was not familiar with some of the avenues like Cleveland's Euclid, so it was fascinating to see how grand this street was and sadly how much it has changed, that I think is the most resonating image you get from this book is how sad it is that we did not perserve these grand American streets as we should have. Having said that, that fact does not diminish the enjoyment of looking at once was. It is refreshing to see that Americans now appreciate the past more and have a better appreciation of the craftsmanship and skill that went into these neighborhoods along these great avenues, but sadly so much has been lost and what made some of these streets so enchanting will never return, but this book at least allows you to look back at what once was and is no more...sic transit gloria."
4,Grand Avenues of America,"Without this book, I never would have ventured to Prairie Avenue in Chicago to see what's left of it. Remarkably, many of the homes like the Glessner House (Henry Hobson Richardson) are still standing and offer tours. There are also many large family homes being built on the vacant lots there that resemble the guilded age homes that once stood there. They are impressive structures to see in person. The book does well with good photographs, but the real thing is the real thing!In Detroit however, it's much more depressing as the Whitney House is one of the few remaining that shows remarkable care. The Brush Park area is a shadow of it's past glory and much of Woodward Avenue was re-built commercially after WWII and...well it's Detroit!A good book to reference prior to a vacation if you have an affection for architectural sight seeing."
4,Telling it like it was,"This book is an excellent source for those seeking an unbiased, non-romanticized account of the period when San Francisco was the center of a cultural whirlwind. By the time the media caught up, it was pretty much over with. A very readable work. Beware, may bring about flashbacks. A definite candidate for another printing."
5,Amazing,"If you like Tim Burton this is the collection for you.From his art style to his casting for each role, you will be greatly impressed with everything this collection has to offer."
5,I love movie sets!,I love movie sets! An AMAZING Tim Burton collection. Wish it had Nightmare Before Christmas. But still good a deal!
5,Amazing collection,"Glad to order this for such an unbelievable price! Replaced a lot my favorite DVDs with Blu Rays in one collection! I'm a huge Tim Burton fan ; and this is perfect, the hardcover book was impressive as well! Thanks ! Stop reading and ORDER IT!"
3,Missed the mark,"Seriously? Tim Burton's best films? Half of these don't even have Johnny Depp.What about Burton's most infamous film? Gee,I don't know,maybe a little film called Edward Scissorhands. Or Ed Wood. Maybe Sleepy Hollow. How about Nightmare before Christmas. You can't seriously be suggesting Charlie ATCF is a better film than the latter. Or even Mars Attacks? It's doing an injustice to the genius that is Tim Burton. Great idea but I say put his better films in the box and charge a little more."
1,What movies?,7 disc 733 minutes. That is basically all you can tell me about this set. If you want me to lay out $42.00 how about at least giving me the titles of the movies on the disc. I will not be preordering this set strictly because of the lack of information.
5,Great Buy!!,Some of Tim Burton's best in one place for an affordable sum. It also comes with an illustrated pamphlet. :-)
4,Great Selection for a Great Price,"I'm already seeing some criticism for this set not containing some of Tim Burton's best films.To that I say, take a breath and think before you type.This set is being released by Warner Brothers. All of the films in this collection were productions made with Warner Brothers Studios. The Tim Burton films that are missing from this set were made at other studios.For example...Edward Scissorhands? 20th Century FoxThe Nightmare Before Christmas? Disney (Orginally a Touchstone production)Sleepy Hollow? ParamountBig Fish? DreamworksEd Wood? Touchstone (aka Disney)Sweeney Todd? DreamworksAlice in Wonderland? DisneySo...before you go spitting venom, do some homework. You're getting seven films at a great price from arguably one of the most visionary directors of our time. I call that a bargain."
5,Great Deal - but no Widescreen for Batman,"I'm giving this 5 stars simply because it delivers as advertised.We've already been through the fact that this is not everyone of Burton's movies.But, what you do get is a very good deal on some stellar movies in Blu Ray.My only issue is that Batman is not Widescreen. So far, I've watched Batman and Mars Attacks (widescreen).The colors in Batman are excellent in this print and the sound is very, very good.Batman has not looked as good since I saw it in the theater so many years ago. And I still agree, Michael Keaton added something special to the movie.If you're a Burton fan you should be pleased.And the book is nice too."
5,The price is right!,I couldn't believe how cheap the set was. All those movies in a Box set with a cool box and a awesome hard cover booklet with full color pictures. Really great collectors item for Tim Burton fans.
5,First high-quality headphones opened my ears up,"I wanted a set of headphones to use at work that find the balance between cutting out neighbors' phone call noise and still allowing me to listen when needed. I ended up getting excited about audiophile headphones after a few days of shopping/reading. I wanted to see if I'd been missing out on music quality. As my first set of decent headphones, the Grado SR80i completely blew away everything else I've used. I'm thinking of getting a set for my brother soon, they're really a pleasure to have. This is a great entry point into a special class of products that makes you rethink your evaluations of everything audio-related."
5,Good earphones,"This set of earphones delivered excellent sound, as advertised. I listened to both classical and jazz and the earphones reproduced the music as well as any of my loudspeakers do. I definitely recommend this product both for sound quality and for its reasonable price."
5,Better sound than the Sennheiser HD280pro,"These are the best sounding headphones I've used.For a long time I've had the Senn HD280 Pro after hearing great things. They were definitely good cansand have great sound isolation but I always thought they sounded kind of dead and lacked impactand crispness.The Grados were a big upgrade and sound superb, super detailed, great punch, sound great at any volume.The box they came in and the design would make you think otherwise but these are great cans.Keep in mind they are an open design, so if you don't want to disturb other around you or you don't wantthem to hear what you have playing go with a closed design."
4,Excellent Sound Quality for the Money,"Sound - Sounds great. No booming bass and very clear vocals. Open sounding, if you want something to isolate you from the outside world, these headphones won't do it. I have listened to these headphones and other Grado phones with headphone amps, and they do sound better. However, I prefer portability and I just use it directly through my computer or mp3 player.Build - They are made of plastic, and attached to the headband with metal posts. One of the cans did break off the headphones early on, but the warranty service was excellent. I've had no problems since then. If you have more money to spend, you can move up to the SR325(aluminum) or the Reference series (wood)."
4,"Not very stylish or modern, but great sound for the money","very well made headset. Cord is heavy duty and long. Definitely not made for an iphone or ipod as the plug will not work with a case on your iphone/ipad/ipod and the noted thick/long cord.I use it for home use connected to a PC. This headphone should be used for stationary listening only, where it is a superb device."
4,Sound sound,"I purchased a pair of SR60 headphones for my wife to use for movie watching on her laptop, and would occasionally use them for my keyboard. I really liked the sound of the 60's and decided to buy a pair for myself and use with the keyboard, iPod, videos, etc. I went for the SR80i model because based on some of the reviews that I read, the 80's have a little better bass response than the 60's, and I wanted a fuller sound from my keyboard."
3,Bass Response is a Problem,"I bought these headphones recently after doing some research into what would be the best cans under $100. I had set myself up to love these phones, but as soon as I took them out of the box and started listening I was disappointed. Yes, the highs and mids are crystal clear, but the bass response is truly lacking. I'm not a ""bass freak"" (though I am a bass player), and I don't like headphones that give out an unnatural amount of bass, but the SR-80s were truly lacking in my opinion. Even the drum sound on jazz/rock music didn't sound round or powerful enough without the bottom end support. I like to ""feel"" the music that I'm listening to, and I found that these headphones were kind of groove-killers, while my $20 Sonys, as muddy as they are, still make me want to dance."
4,"Wonderful, with help","These suckers are amazing, they have relatively comfortable ear foam pads. They aren't designed to envelop your ears, just sit on top.The sound quality of these headphones are fantastic, I think my only gripe with them would be bass response right out of the box. They do not sound tinny, but the bass is pretty weak until you do a little sonic shaping with an EQ, but once that's taken care of, they deliver like a champion.I'm currently using these as studio monitors and they work great for that, but just as well for small audio devices as well. I'd highly recommend them."
4,great!,These are great headphones. Great sound and comfortable. The only reason we didn't give 5 stars was because there are 2 cords and the earpieces rotate and can get twisted a little. We are very happy we purchased these.
2,Good sound but not comfortable to wear,"Clean, flat response. Foam ear cushions rest mostly on, not around ear, so discomfort ensues rapidly.Foam also makes headphone sounds very noticeable to bystanders, not unlike blaring your car radio with your windows open.In summmary, good sound for very short listening sessions only."
2,poor quality...,"These Grado SR80is started out OK but soon (about 1 week) developed a crackling distortion in the left ear.I returned them for repair but the crackling was back in the left (repaired?) driver after a few days. Not wanting to return them again and pay more I tried to bear with it but it got worse. It would completely distort and eventually lose volume altogether, while the right side remained ok. Now the left ear doesnt work at all and a slight crackle is developing in the right ear...so I can't use them. I feel like I was taken for $100 + shipping costs for repair.I have a pair of cheaper Sonys that work without a problem on the same system and same music but I use those at work because they are closed design.These are definitely not good for bassy music.I consider this fair warning.I know i will not be buying another set of Grados."
2,Not for me!,"My first use, on a very long flight, of the S80i proved to be a total disappointment. I had high expectations after reading so many positive reviews, but the sound quality did not seem any better than from my ear-buds that came with my iPod. One of the cushioned ear pieces came off - never to be found again. The excellent part of this transaction was the easy return."
5,pleasantly suprised,"I was looking for a good pair of stereo headphones to replace an old pair. I didn't want to spent alot but I didn't want cheap ether.So after some research I setteled on these.The first time I had them on I was pleasantly suprised on just how good they sound and look foward to many hours of enjoyment from them. A very good purchase for the money. I would not hesitate to buy these again should something happen to my current set and I am happy to recommending these headphones to anyone wanting a great sounding headphone without breaking the bank. They are an open system so you will hear whatever is going on around you but that is what I wanted, in case the phone rings or someone needed my attention. They look to be well made and should last for years with proper care. The research paid off, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
4,Great Sound But Right side quite,"This was a great sounding pair of headphones, however, after a couple of uses the right side headphone just stop receiving any sound. Not sure of problem, but as I stated the unit sounded great. That's why the 4 stars. Refund received without any problem. Not happy I had to pay for the shipping, which, was why I did not ask for replacement."
4,Ok.. I guess,"These sound really good for rock/ metal but if you are a bass head look at something else. I guess maybe everything would sound good on these except music with lots of bump. The highs are in your face. The mids are right there where they belong. Bass.... Well, you be the judge. Thank god I'm really into rock."
3,Meh.,"One of the phones stopped working after a few months, was very good while it lasted though, especially with high end audio vocals.Now using another set of something else I had laying around."
3,Meh,"Just pay a little for more forAudio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones. It's definitely worth it. The SR80's bass is relatively wimpy, and if you like hiphop or electronic music, you will be disappointed. The ATH-M50's sound incredible and are just $60 more, which isn't too bad over the lifetime of a good pair of headphones."
2,crappy plug,"Overall, I liked the sound and feel of the headpones. However, the cable is heavy and puts a strain on the plug and the sound quality is affected because of the inconsistent contact of the plug. I tried it with the larger adaptor in the stereo (versus computer and iPod) and got the same problem. Now I have to see how good their customer service is...after 10 days. That stinks!"
4,Right Headphone Fell Off,As I said in the title the right headphone fell apart. They should have made it sturdier for longer usage. Other than that these are a boon for low budget audiophiles.
4,"Good sound, good price","Good value for the price. Holds up to more expensive headphones. Cancels out outside sound and gives a full, lush sound to the music."
3,Not what I expected after reading other reviews.,"The Grado SR80i headphones were not a good as I expected based on the reviews I had read. My old Sennheiser headphones are much better - better overall sound, more comfortable, and more efficient. I was also disappointed with build quality. These headphones are just OK. Try others before you buy the Grado SR80i."
5,"It is true, Grado is really great!","They sound great, the highs and mids are just right on. The bass is mellow, and isn't for bumping. I do think they work ok with dubstep since wobble base is a melodic bass line benefits from these headphones tight control. Yet, I wouldn't use it for 90s bass heavy stuff (No Dj Magic Mike or 2live Crew) and the like. The sound stage is good and very open, and for me that means it doesn't sound like a boombox inside a small dorm room.The build quality is very nice also, although they came in a cheap box with a nice cut out foam. Grado Labs isn't a mega corp worried about packaging. The sound and build quality come first. So, it is amazing these are American made."
4,"Great sound, Great price, Compromising comfort","I bought a pair of these, my wife tried them and liked them so much that she asked me to get a pair for her for Valentines Day (chocolates and flowers don't do it for her). These headphones sound as good as my Bose for a fraction of the cost but give up a little in comfort (they do fit better with more use). Do they really need that thick of a cord?"
3,Notice the earpads...,I am a big fan of the old SR-80 headphones and have been enjoying mine for many years. I stopped by to order another set when I noticed something didn't look right.It's the ear pads. The old 80's have cup style pads that surround the ears a bit. These are now flat on-the-ear pads like the SR-60's. I passed on the 60's for that reason - I don't want my ears pressed flat. And if the pressure is too light they are just going to slide off.I just wanted to draw that to your attention in case you are ordering a second pair or are mislead by all the great reviews and awards based on the OLD style.
1,Blown out speaker and came back still broken from repair.,I bought these along with a NuForce amp. They worked for a couple of months. Then at one point the right ear started making a dirty noise. I finally got fed up with it and sent the headphones in for repair. I described the problem in a letter (sent in with headphones) and over the phone when I originally made the complaint. They came back a couple of weeks later stating that there was nothing wrong and to check my amp. Well I did and the amp is fine. I tried the phones with 3 different sources and still had the same problem. Overall I'm very unhappy with what I understood to be a fine company.
2,Poor design.,"The plastic holding the earcups to the headset are thin and fragile. Mine lasted 7 months before they cracked at the most vulnerable point, where the metal shaft entered the ""C""shaped earcup holder. I was always a careful user. I can't believe a trained engineer actually designed such a flimsy setup.Sound quality was very good, but cannot makeup for such a short life span.I returned the earphones to Amazon.com and received an 80% refund [since they were broken]."
5,"Great sound, not very comfortable to wear.",Grado is one of the few companies to win an audio award for their headphones. My friend Aaron who is a fantastic producer and recording engineer suggested them to me. They give out a very true sound compared to most headphones. You can flatten the EQ and the music still sounds great. However they are not very comfortable. After about thirty minutes they start to hurt my ears.
2,Too uncomfortableto keep,"I purchased these headphones for my son as a Christmas gift. He found them to be uncomfortable on his ears. I ended up returning them. I didn't find them too uncomfortable, and am kicking myself for not keeping them for myself, the sound is very good."
2,Okay... Don't Believe the Hype,"I bought these headphones under the impression that they were the best headphones you could get for ~100. I bought them through one call, and I have to say, they had amazing customer service. These headphones were okay, but the problem I had with them was that the bass was horrible. My $20 Skullcandy Titan earbuds had more bass. I listen to mainly rap and hip-hop, so I probably picked up the wrong headphones for that. I recommend headphones that are designed for hip hop if that is what you listen to. IF you do not care about bass, these headphones may be for you, otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
3,"Good sound, for everyone in the room","These headphones have awesome sound, unfortunately I have to have my media player on the lowest setting or my office-mates can hear my music (actually they still can!). Seriously, you can rotate the phones around so you're listening to the back of them and the volume is about the same!! Isn't the idea of headphones is that others around you can't hear the music? It's a pity, since the sound is nice, but they are unusable in the workplace."
5,Amazing Sound,"After hearing all the great reviews about this product I was very dissappointed when I first plugged in these phones. The bass was very flat and the phones were not very clear. The other reviewers mentioned a break in period so I decided to leave the phones running on my CD jutebox for about 30 hours. WOW!, what a difference in sound. It was like night and day with the sound quality. The sound is truely amazing. The bass was very good and the phones were very clear. Grado needs to state this breakin period on the box or manual because some people may decide to return the phones not realizing there is a breakin period."
5,Ahh - There's the music.,"I have a creative zen micro mp3 and it powers these headphones perfectly. I wanted to say that up front as no review I could find explained this. You need no amp with these headphones. Music is amazing through these headphones. I cannot believe what you can hear. Perfect Balance, Clarity, Detail, Bass, It's all there. I have listened to classical, metal, techno, rap, opera whatever you listen to with these you hear so many small details you never heard before. I have several pairs of cans and these are my favorite until I can spend the money for a pair of Grado 325i's(Oh yes I want another pair). These aren't as comfortable at first as others on the market but sound is so fantastic and they are so light."
5,Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone,"Never heard of this product before, but the fellow at Radio Shack advised me to look it up at Amazon.com. Which I did. It was easy to set up, and fit perfectly. It came without undue delay, and I use it daily."
5,Wonderful headphones,"These headphones are simply amazing for the price. I would recommend these cans any time of the day. The bass is not POWERFUL so if that's what you're into, go ahead and keep searching. They do leak a lot of sound because they're open back. The comfort level is also a little lacking. There is not padding on the headband part. Also if you're going to bed and you're listening to music before you sleep, the foam pads will tend to fall off. But i can't imagine there are a lot of people who fall asleep with them on. Great headphones all around though."
2,Only lasted 3 weeks,"The sound quality was amazing and the earphones were pretty comfortable. BUT, these phones lasted less than a month before the sound in the right earphone went out completely."
5,Very Good Headphones,"I really like these headphones. they can be a little awkward to wear and the cord is pretty heavy tho. I missed the bass-heavy style that we're so accustomed to at first, but really, i can't imagine going back to those days anymore. Those bass-heavy headphones drown out so much detail. With these I hear things in my music that I had never heard before.REMEMBER to use a flat EQ with these! they'll sparkle."
5,Wear glasses? Buy These,"I'm forced to use headphones late at night to enjoy my vintage Luxman reciever. Only problem ... after an hour or so my ""over the ear"" style headphones push the thin wire frames of my glasses into the sides of my head. The solution ... Grado's SR 80i ""open ear"" designed headphones.(Open ear phones can be heard by someone sitting close enough to you and you can hear surrounding noise if it's loud enough. I myself did not find these to be much of an issue since the sound these headphones emit at a medium loud volume level is neglegible) They set lightly ""on-top"" of my ears instead of completely covering them as with most other headphones. They have a very respectable sound reproduction and I do not think they are cheaply designed as others have reported. If you wear glasses and want a reasonable audiophile experience without breaking the bank I highly recommend Grado's SR 80i headphones."
3,For recorded music only,"The SR80's sound is impeccable, better than anything else I have tried, and they are relatively comfortable.Be forewarned however, that these are for listening to recorded music only. Do not even attempt to use these for live music, they blow out very easily. I know, I have gone through several pairs. I will probably buy another pair just for passive listening, but will never again use them for monitoring live keyboards or guitar."
5,fanstastic,"I worship these phones. Incredibly detailed, fast, amazing impact. I love drum based music and nothing compares to Grado headphones with that. I also listen to a very wide variety of genres and SR80 work with everything well. Bass quality is great, could be a bit light on the quantity if you don't use EQ.I also have SR325i, but these are still just amazing for the price. SR325i are about a third better than SR80 to me.Some find the soundstage small, but it's just a different kind. It's in your head between your eyes and really gets you involved."
4,good headphones,good headphones sound great build quality not so good they did not even bother to sand off parts of the headphones on the plastic the cable gets tangled and rotating ear cups are to blame
4,Awesome sound quality with a few minor caveats.,"Great sound quality. A tiny bit of buzzing on really deep low ends. A little uncomfortable for extended periods of usage. The sound quality is spectacular and the look is really unique. They can get very loud and are audible from a meter or two away, even when they are on your head, so if you like it loud, you should keep in mind that other people around you will have the ability to hear what you're listening to."
4,"Good headphones, versatile and can be used for a lot of music and applications.","Sounds pretty good with any type of music whether its Method Man's ""Release yo delf"" or Moldau by Smetana. Was surprisingly good as gaming headphones also, with really good positioning capabilities.Only complaint are the pads, given these are meant to rest on top of the ear and are not circumaural. After extended wear they tend to push your ears in, and unless you have perfectly flat ears, they'll become slightly uncomfortable.Definitely stay at home headphones though. There is NO sound isolation at all, which is not what it's designed to do anyway."
1,Not recommended,"I bought these headphones several months ago, and while the sound is not bad, they were never very comfortable and the flimsy padding over the earphones (which didn't look like they would last through much usage anyway) were great lint accumulators. I was constantly picking dust and dirt off them. Now, a few days ago, the rod holding the earphone to the headpiece cam unstuck, and as far as I can tell, cannot be fixed. I cannot recommend this product."
3,"Excellent sounding pair, but they have design flaws","These head phones sound awesome. There's no other way to describe it. All you have to do is provide them with a quality source (i.e. not from a cell phone / ipod) and you are sure to be satisfied with the output. For less than a 100$, these are about the best you can buy. They come packaged in a very simple box with no frills.I still ended up returning it because of design problems. The cable is very long and thick. It makes it unweildy to carry around while listening to them. If you do use them on an ipod or a portable MP3 player, the size and weight of the cable messes up the balance of the set up."
3,Short Lived Great Sound,I have owned two pairs. Each was wonderful for a while until the wires began to fail much too young. I won't buy another pair. It is frustrating.
2,Hype,"These headphones came highly recommended, I only wish I could say the same for anyone else purchasing these cans. I'll admit the sound is genuine, but these headphones only work with certain genres and its appeal starts to wear off when you realize these headphones are a one trick pony. Comfort isn't great but was never an issue, my problem is the build quality. After nearly a month of purchase, the left channel started buzzing like crazy! For no reason, they were very well taken care of! Now I'm having to ship these headphones to Brooklyn to have them repaired! From what I've read Grado takes incredibly long to actually do the repairs, and many of them come back with the same issues that plague them before shipping!Buyer beware!!!These headphones are nothing but hype, and are certainly not worth 100 dollars.YOU WILL REGRET THIS PURCHASE"
3,One Surprise - Noise Pollution,"I got these headphones and am fairly happy with them but there was one big and notable surprise that I just didn't realize.They let out lots of ambient sound while you are wearing them. So much that they may be impractical for use in a public area. I got tapped on the shoulder often with people saying ""your headphones are not working and we can hear it quite clearly."" I was surprised since this was not at all the experience I've had with other over the ear headphones.If you are going to listen by yourself these are great. With people around not so much, get something else if you want to be left alone with your music in a crowd."
3,They're not that great...,"I have to agree with Waymen Askey's review. I bought the sr80's because of the high raved reviews, but don't be so misleaded as I was. I've had these headphones for about 6 months and have been using them with my 3rd generation and 5th generation ipod, and concluded that the sr80's arn't all that. Yeah sure, the mids and highs are phenomenal, absolutley vividly clear. But the bass arn't on par. The bass just doesn't hit as other headphones I've had before. If you can, I would highly recommend you listen to them before you buy them. If you desire bass, don't get them."
2,Noisy,These headphones were a bit noisy to people in the room. Not a lot of separation as I listened to an array of music.
5,Historically Compelling,I have read several of Bob Cornuke's books. He does his research and writes a very exciting story. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!
5,A very thrilling adventure,"Finally I have read a book from someone who isn't sure that Noah's Ark is on Mt. Ararat! Cornuke tells the story of his own problems with tunnel vision during the search, and know I think he may be on the right track. If you want to get your blood pumping, this book will do it!"
1,kilimanjaro is the true mt Zion,"Hi My Name is Chuwa, I come from Mt Kilimanjaro. I know for a fact that The real Mt Is kilimanjaro, but no one wants to admit that Africa is the true land but i got to bring this out to you right now. Look at pictures of Kilimanjaro and the animals thats the truth right there."
3,Academic Review of,"[...]My concerns with the book are related to ``what is theory?'' and ``what are the important theories?''.First, the ``what is theory?''. To say that some of the positions presented in each chapter are theoriesis really pushing the label of theory. Certainly, many of the paradigms do not measure up to thedefinition of theory that the editors of the book state in the preface or which are in the leading chapterof section one."
3,Good,I really love Janet Dawson's books and usually am not able to put them down once started. This one I had a hard time maintaining my interest. I would still recommend anything that she writes.
1,A Poor Book on FTTH,"The book ports to provide insight into the FTTH technologies and tries to address things at a very high level, however due to the technical inaccuracies in this book it is a very bad choice for people who wants to understand FTTH and some of its underlying technologies. Just as other reviews stated, the book is unfortunately riddled with typographical and grammatical errors (shame on the Editor at Wiley Publishers), which when combined with the technical flaws makes this book a very poor choice."
5,excellent overall history,"this book is not a medical reference or textbook. it is, however, an excellent historical exploration of brain and neuroscience. i loved it! i am not a doctor, but an historian, and my curiosity on the subject was satiated. i can now hold up an impressive end of a conversation regarding all things neurological. this book is for the general public, and all those who want to learn more about civilization, anthropology, biology, science, etc...highly recommended."
5,Lesson on Faith,"This short children's book about a child planting and caring for a carrot seed is a simple, yet profound, lesson on how faith works. It is one of the best books on faith that I have read - even for adults."
2,Perseverance at a price!,"The small and simple story sends a message of 'keep at it' even if family members tell you it won't work. In fact, the success turns out to be way out of proportion. It really doesn't have to be that way. Looking for another book on the subject."
5,A lesson in persistence paying off,"Though the story is simple, the message is grand. If you want to teach your children the value of persistence, this would be a very nice book to add to your children's library.As the little boy is repeatedly told his efforts are in vain, he quietly goes about his business and, in the end, he is rewarded for his labor. You can use this story to help your children overcome the naysayers they are sure to encounter in life. (Of course, they will also need to learn the value of listening to and heeding wise advice - but that can always be taught from another story.)"
4,A Very Nice Introduction to Stories and Reading,"This is a very simple story about a young boy's confidence that the seed he plants will grow. He persists in caring for it, even though his family expresses skepticism, and his perseverance is met with success. This is a nice short read-aloud for young children who are just beginning to grasp the structure of stories, or those who are just moving into reading on their own. If using as an easy reader, though, I don't recommend the board book format which older children will identify as babyish."
4,simple book about perseverance,"This simple, short book is about a boy who plants a carrot seed. Everyone tells him it will not grow, but he perseveres and in the end is vindicated. A nice (and important) lesson for children. Illustrations are by Crockett Johnson, the author's husband, who gave us the Harold and the Purple Crayon books."
5,Authentic,"Great feel for the original publishing from the feel of the paper to the illustrations and colors. So happy to have it, thanks."
4,An Uncommonly Intelligent Read,"Michael Crichton's novels are all good reads, but none fulfilled me quite like this one. The Great Train Robbery tells the story of a criminal mastermind who sets up the perfect crime, the robbery of an indestructable steam beast. Edward Pierce is about the most brilliant, charming, and well-rounded criminal character ever written. This explosive insight into the criminal mind should not be missed."
2,What a Waste of time! Crichton's better than this!,Horrible book and boring as heaven! Crichton's alot better than this garbage. This Book and The Terminal Man are his worst books. Looking for pure Crichton fun? Read Sphere.
2,Reads like a Junior High History Assignment,"I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books. Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature. The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements. As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective. The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read. I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report."
2,The Great Train Robbery,"If you want a fun filled book with lots of action, then this is the book for you. The book is placed in Victorian London with the main characters Robert Edgar and Edward Pierce. The master minds behind the great train robbery. They are planning to do what no one has ever done before. On the way it takes some turns that you don't really under stand until the very end.My favorite part of the story is when the main character Edward pierce is over at the train station manager's home trying to get the location of the 3rd key to the strong box. It is not as easy as it sounds.The main idea of the book is to show you that any thing is possible if you try hard. I gave the book a 4 it was vary go and if you read it al then it is very rewarding."
3,Not Crichton's Best,"Actually the rating is more of a 3.5. This book had some obvious postives and negatives. The beginning is confusing and the first 40 or so pages are a real drag. It's obvious Criton did research and all, but its in no way exciting. Then the book starts to pick up and gets interesting during ""The Keys"" section. The characters are well developed and Crichton sorta ties everything together, but it gets old quickley. I had to force myself to finish this book. Worth reading, but expect for the book to bore you for a little while."
3,Just not quite there.,"I have read all of Crichton's works, and usually come away well satisfied when I close whatever book I happen to have read. I can't say the same for The Great Train Robbery. Yes, it is very well-written, and portrays Victorian England in a realism I've rarely seen before. Yes, the characters are lively and interesting. But I was so bored! I literally had to force myself to finish, and to be honest, don't remember much of the plot. I feel that this is a departure from the quality of much of Crichton's other work. While most fans are going to read it simply because it's Crichton, I wouldn't recommend it to new readers. Try Time Line or Jurassic Park first."
4,One of Crichton's best,"I put off reading this book, because I thought it was a 'period piece' and not really my style. Big mistake. This is a wonderful book, and I found myself totally immersed."
3,Good But Rambles On,I thought it was a good book but i think he could of fit all the stuff he needed into about 200 pages instead of 300 pages.
1,What happened?,"Ugh. This book bored the hell out of me. I'm sorry to have to disagree with all the people who thought this book was great, but YAWN! I LOVE Michael Crichton's books, I've loved every single one he has written...except this one. Of course, this WAS one of the first books he wrote, it was written in the '70s, but man! OK, this is why I didn't like it. I couldn't concentrate on the characters, I didn't LIKE the characters, the beginning of the book was confusing, the plot was confusing, and it just plain didn't hold my interest. If you've never read Crichton before, DO NOT start off with this book. He's much better at science fiction and modern real life. Read ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Sphere"" first. I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me about this book, but I just did not like it like I love Crichton's other books."
3,The dictionary,"Why a writer has to write a book with words that nobody understand them. Why not just write in plain English? How do I know that nobody understand those words? Because after M.C. wrote them he immediately explains them and that means that he wanted to write overly pages in this book.The story is just a story. He tried to make a thriller of a real story and just wrote a book which by far is not M.C.'s best. I can even say that if you have two books to choose, leave this one."
3,Not his best work,"Interesting story about the great train robbery. OK read, but not his best work. I would not recommend it as an example of his writing."
5,Love It!,"I've read this book several times and enjoy it every time. The research Michael Crichton put into this book about Victorian life is interesting to read, almost amazing to me."
4,Straight from Victorian Britain,"I liked the story quite a bit, and it is based on actual events in Victorian Britain. One thing with which I had trouble was the profusion of criminal terms from England of the mid 19th century. It would be helpful to keep a notebook handy as you read, and make notes of the definitions of the terms as they are introduced. Then you can refer to them later as you encounter them again in the text. I consider Michael Chrichton my favorite author, and among his books I have read Andromeda Strain, Congo, Sphere, Jurassic Park, Rising Sun, Timeline, State of Fear and Pirate Latitudes. Of these, I would easily recommend Timeline as my favorite, and State of Fear as my least favorite. The Great Train Robbery, as with the others, falls somewhere in the middle."
3,Excellent book of examples,"If you're looking for explicit or step-by-step instruction on applying lighting and shadow to your drawing, this probably isn't the book for you. If, on the other hand, you're looking for real-world illustration examples of just about every type of lighting situation (even through fog and rain), be sure to pick this one up!Burne Hogarth, with his immaculate drawing style, presents examples of everything from multi-point lighting to backlighting. I particularly enjoyed his examples of lighting the foreground, middle ground, and background differently. As always, the author's books are a joy just to look through."
1,Awful... this deserves NO stars...,"Luckily I only borrowed this book and didd't waste any money on it...I bet your an artist who'd love to have a better understanding of light, right? Of how it reacts in different situations and fun stuff like that? Just because this seems to be the only book out there, it does not make it any good.It's a selfish excuse for a gallery ofhis work. If you like galleries, buy it.However I was looking for something that would allow me to understand how light worked in different situations. I reccomend, instead of this, ""Light and Shade (Barron's Art Handbooks: Green Series)""Much better.... it actually explains rather then expecting you to know already."
4,Light & Shade in Art,This book is good to illustrate the phenomena of light in a composition. It discusses the different kinds of light and their effect on the environment of the picture. Worth getting to use as reference material.
1,Disappointing,I bought this book because i thought i could learn something .... actually i didn't ... this book just a gallery for the author ... it just contain drawings in black and white and you are suppose to see & take an idea ... if you are looking for a book for learning .... choose another book ... don't wast your money.
3,50/50,"Honestly i was expecting more, this book doesnt have the drawing ( shading in this case ) process explained in such a good way as some other books. But its not so bad, I guess this book is worth getting after you got the others, Im not sure if I will stil buy Burne Hogarth books, maybe I will, but definetly AFTER I buy other art books im interested in buying. (...)"
4,Good Book For Aspiring Comic Artists,"As the father of the Tarzan character and art, and the co-founder of the School of Visual Arts with silas rhodes, Burne Hogarth is far qualified to teach the fundamentals of great figure drawing. His Drawing Series of Books should be on the shelves of any aspiring comic artist.For more information on his books and a short collected listing of other useful books for aspiring comic artists and illustrators available in Amazon.com, visit der Mudgecko's Reading List for Comic Artists at:"
4,Are there no black flies in vermont?,"I found ""The Road Home"" to be an easy book to read and very enjoyable.Except for being a man the author could of been me on my own adventures in Maine the past ten years. It is fantastic to know that there are still pioneers in this world that can chuck it all. But being from Northern N.E. I have never read a book about this region that did not include our mud and black fly/mosquito seasons.If you survive that you have done well."
5,Great blush,This is a really pretty blush on my porcelain skin. I didn't have to use much of it to get the desired results. I like that about Larenim that a little goes a long way with all of their products. I think that this colour would look good on any skin tone. I'll buy a full size container when my sample runs out. I highly recommend this line of make up.
1,Artistic License is one thing...,"It is not unheard of, the gospel of Jesus changed to tell a story in a new way; examples being: ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", ""the Blue-Grass Gospel"" and one might even go as far as to say ""Forest Gump""; but to make one's""Jesus Figure"" go against the nature of Jesus entirely is disrespectful and evil. Whether you are a homophobe, homosexual supporter, or a christian, it doesn't change the fact that Jesus himself was against homosexuality. By making him homosexual dipicts Jesus as a completely different person. It is like dipicting Ghandi as a soldier. Jesus should remain true to his character. This is not to evangelize or preach, I'm simply stating that in a free society we should be respectful to christians and there beliefs as we expect them to be respectful to everyone else."
2,Unbelievable justification,"The play, certainly, did have a lot of emotion, was moving and well written, but in the end, just comes off as some one's attempt to justify their homosexuality. There is obviously some kind of moral struggle going on and this play is simply part of some one else's ill bred attempt to come out on top. The play comes off as being very insincere, far fetched and even blasphemous. I am shocked that it has been so well recieved and can only assume that we are trying to hard to be open minded that we have made ourselves blind instead to what can only be described as literary garbage. It is not original, not well thought out and written only to inflame the sentiments of god fearing people, and this sort of behavior is deplorable, especially for true literary enthusiasts. There are better way to get your point across and make homosexuality accepted besides slandering christ. I felt that this play was not worth the time it took to read and was very disappointed by it."
2,Release date is wrong,Do not get fooled by the release date on this DVD. Don't get me wrong. The stories are as good as always. But the actual production are probably in the late 80s or early 90's. But after watching those more recent Thomas release DVD you'll not be interest in watching those old productions.
5,If you are an adult and buy one book this year...,"... then it should be this one. There are so many wisdoms packed in there, one of them being that, well, most adults have sex. Quite a few of them like it and even more would like to like it more, do it more, or enjoy it more. If, by doing this, you can happen upon a deeper meaning of life, and with that, your place in it, all the better. It doesn't get much more understandable, both God and Sex, than the way Deida talks to us about both."
4,Good Book for Foreign Students,"I volunteer teach in the library Literacy Program and bought this book for my student from Fiji. She loves it and carries it with her all the time. Although it's geared for advanced learners, my student is just reading English at about 4th grade level and finds this book very helpful. She uses it to look up words she doesn't understand and to learn synonyms and antonyms. She will still be using this book ten years from now when she's reading English at college level."
2,Bad CD-ROM,"I bought it for CD-ROM with sound tracks of native speaker. But, it is not work in mynew laptop. It took 2 minute to load the program. And always said InternalError!!! after I want to search a word.I though that it is the best seller product with the best quality. But this CD-ROM changed my mind about Oxford's produces."
3,Compass CD not friendly to use,"Hi :Good CD companion, specially the ""Wordfinder"". A very negative point is that the wheel mouse doesn't scroll the screen down (I am using windows vista)The word ""stinging"" is not present both in the printed and CD version of the dictionary.I was using Longman LDOCE dictionary before and my motivation to buy Oxford was the ""Wordfinder"" CD feature, but I think the printed version of Longman is much better than the Oxford one."
4,Good dictionary - software could be improved,"Though the dictionary is good along with various tests, games and videos, what concerns me is the software it's packaged in.Many times, the installation is not smooth with some or the other error message popping up. Though that so far hasn't affected the running of the software, it gives a bad feeling.Moreover, many aspects of the software isn't user friendly. You can copy only one definition at a time, can't use arrow key to move to drop down items, can't change the font and many more.Though these are at best trivial, an improved version could be much more easy to use."
2,Very good content hampered by copy protection,"The dictionary is excellent, and the extras as very good as well. This is a very well known product and I won't spend much to praise it. It lacks thesaurus, though.My problem is with the CD-Cops protection used (and you're not told when buying). It is tricky, sometimes it will stop working with no explanation and manual registry cleaning is necessary to fix it. And now, I found out that the dictionary will not start without the cd-drom drive in the bay, even when I'd done the full installation.If you want my advice, go for the Collins Cobuild, that will give you less fancy extras, but more functionality: a thesaurus and lots of usage examples.UPDATE on 19 Sept. 2004 - after managing to find someone useful in OUP support team, I finally got free of charge an update that solved all the problems I was experiencing. Apparently my version has some incompatibility with Win XP."
5,Favorite Perfume,"I don't care for most perfumes, but I love Touch of Pink ! It is soft, feminine, fresh and sexy. My other favorite perfume is Sunflowers. If you are like me and hate heavy strong perfumes, you may enjoy this as well. Fast shipper and good price from this seller."
4,Nice...,"Arrived on time. Great condition. Lovely fragrance, just a little expensive I think. I thinks is appropriate for day use, especially for afternoon. I use it for work, and i think is Ok."
1,Item is not the same,Item received is not the same as ordered. I received a tester demo product that says not for sale on the cheap looking box. Very unsatisfied with this seller. How can you give this as a gift? Will not buy from this seller again.
5,Great light perfume!,My soon to be wife loved the fragrance because she does not like heavy perfumes. The bottle is very nice and it lasted a few months!
3,Fun,I bought this to teach my son the importance of saving money. It was pretty fun to sit and watch it with him. Definitely worth the money!!!
3,The Noddy book,"A friend of mine correctly called this the 'noddy' book, good to fall asleep with. Get your feet wet, but don't find answers to real problems is what this book offers. And don't get tricked by the included CD's, they're very dated."
3,Not enough for the MCP test.,"This is not a good book if you are trying to get certified. If you just want to learn about Windows NT Server, this is a great book. The book did not focus on testing type materials."
3,good photography /so-so models,"Pretty much everything about this book is true, pretty nicely produced etc. I feel the models are pretty ordinary looking, pretty much your garden variety art school models. They are in a word un-attractive. If you hated it in art school when some homely out of shape model plumped down on the stand then you will hate this book."
1,About useless,"Other books in this series come with a CD with high quality images to work from. The paperback version don't come with that CD. Some of the photos are 4""x5"" which makes them only useful for a gesture drawing as far as I am concerned."
1,Doesn't do it for me,"I am a sculpter. The idea of getting a DVD with all the angles to the poses on it made me very enthausiastic about this book. The moment I first opened it I knew I'd never use it. I am not sure what is wrong with it but it doesn't work for me. Not a shred of inspiration anywhere.It's not that the models are too ugly or not ugly enough. It's just all so ""ordinary"". The poses don't work either. No suspense, no strong lines, no nudes, just a book/DVD full of naked people."
5,art reference book,"An outstanding reference for the serious artist. I've been doing art as a sideline since grade school, and I haven't seen a reference as good as this before. It's in extremely high definition and you can enlarge the shots to an amazing degree. Each pose can be viewed from numerous angles, and there's an excellent variety of body types and poses, and they're all well lit. There's no replacing drawing or painting the actual model, but if you can't afford modeling fees this is a good substitute.Buy it; you won't regret it."
5,An excellent reference book,"If you are an artist(painter, sculptor, etc.) and you just can't afford live models this is a great book. Good poses, good lighting, a most important good photography. Don't make the same mistake I did, buy the hard cover with the cd-rom, it is only a couple dollars more and the hardcover will last far longer the constant opening and closing as you use it, plus the disc has images in far more detail and angles. Buy it with confidence."
5,"""Complete"" Bookof Radio Control short on Information","I just received my copy of the recently published book and anticipated learning something about radio controlled models. What a disapointment! There is absolutely no advise of any value, except an admonishment to start with a manufacturers kit. The rest of the book is an advertisement and promotion of those kits. Very disapointing. Don't waste your money."
1,A disappointing purchase,"A comprehensive collection of color photographs of RC models, makes a lovely cofee table item - but the value stops at that. The text is filled with inaccuracies that render the book worthless as a guide to the hobby, so much that I wondered if the author had actual hands on experience with the subject matter."
5,An excellent kayaking resource,"This is the essential guidebook for paddling around the Puget Sound regions. It is one of those books that keeps getting updated every few years, so it is never too far out of date, which is important in our changing world. The marine environment doesn't change much, but access and facilities required to get and stay there do, and this book helps a lot with that.This is a great book for the day paddler or the committed water traveler, since it rates the difficulty of each trip, lists places to camp and gives clear directions to launch and recovery points. It covers all the inland waters of the Puget Sound at some level of detail. Maps are a key feature of a book like this, and theirs are excellent. If you paddle the Sound, this book belongs in your truck."
2,Size not as advertised,"The elastic band turned out to be much wider than the watch lugs, despite having measured carefully. The instructions for the page to be used as a measuring guide state to print at a ""100 %"". Well, Acrobat PDF reader doesn't give you a 100% option, just ""fit"" and ""actual"". Regardless, the size as shipped is too wide.... :("
4,Good but not Great,"This is a good watchband. It fits many Timex watches including the Expedition. The band itself is a canvas strap which I like alot because it ""breathes"" with me. The clasp is the end of the band which goes through a plastic loop and fastens to itself with velcro. Actually my only complaint is that I'm a big guy and the strap, even at its most loose, is a bit tight for me. I know - lose weight! So, my overall rating is good, but for me, not great."
2,Not for 16mm,I have a watch with a 16mm watchband that broke so I ordered this. I'm very disappointed because the elastic part that holds the watch case is 20mm so it is impossible to use. Aside from that it does seem to be a solid product.
2,Unhappy,"Top 5 reasons why I am unhappy with this:1) band is cheap - 8.95 is not commensurate with cheap velcro strap on nylon material2) The 16-20mm band just does not fit my 16 mm watch. Not sure how they came up with this...3) the band is NOT leather - only the little ""Expedition"" seal is made of ""leather""4) the strap's loophole is made of plastic, which would be bound to break immediately.5) nowhere on the product's page is any of this detailed.However, it arrived in a timely fashion."
1,Doesn't Fit The Watch,It says it is a 16 to 20mm band (this size is the distance between the arms that hold the band). My watch is 20mm and this band was way too wide. One more thing in the recycle bin.
1,never buy there again,ordered it at the end of marcg - i should have goten it till 29aprstill waite. send them email at 29apr via amazon - they didnt replycost 25$ and would never buy there again stay away from that store
2,Not great for smaller wrists,"I am a woman who likes a large dial, more rugged man's style watch. This band is not great for a smaller wrist. The velcro at the end of the strap does not hold tight to the band, and it catches on the cuffs of sweaters and fleeces, making them pill. The issue is exacerbated by the wideness of the velcro bit - it doesn't taper and is not rounded, so it catches easily. My husband (he's 6' 2"" but not heavy) found a similar issue when he tried it. If your wrist has a larger circumference, the problem might not be as noticeable.Otherwise it was very easy to put on; I feared a lot of fiddling with the spring bars, but they were a cinch to manipulate."
5,Great watch band!,"Band works great. Comfortable and very secure. I've broke multiple bands by catching the watch head on stuff, this one is very forgiving and springs right back to shape without any negative effects. Elastic is very tight, unlike the original band my watch came with which allowed LOTS of movement of the watch face.I will be buying this band any time I'm in need of a replacement watch band from now on. Very satisfied."
2,works well enough but stinks quickly,this strap is comfortable but seems to get stinky very quickly which was no an issue on my old band
4,MOST COMFORTABLE STRAP,"Second Voguestrap I've used. Previously had one on my old Timex Ironman and loved it. Superior to the Timex line of nylon/velcro bands. Had to get one for my new G-Shock.The G-Shock has 16mm mounts so installing this strap took some force and patience. But it certainly can be done and the watch is solidly secured. What I really like about the Voguestrap is you do not have to overly-tighten the band to keep the watch from rolling. The natural flex of the band and the adjustability of velcro allows you to keep your watch secure without feeling tight or pinching. Also, the band (or you wrist) doesn't sweat.One egg off because there isn't a lot of tightening play for my thin wrist (6-1/4""). As others have noted, it probably works best for those with thicker wrists. But it does fit me without overlap. I'll definitely be using another Voguestrap when this one wears out (figure on about 1-1/2 to 2 years). Maybe I should just order another one now!"
4,Works Great,I love the way this strap fits snuggly and is wide on the wrist. It is tight and needs to be squeezed in to accomodate the watch to some degree but this so not much of an issue. Can have the short end on either side to suit yourself.
3,Nylon watch band,I have a Timex Expedition wrist watch and my leather band broke so I was looking for a replacement. I have already replaced it once with a timex leather band. From the picture I thought I was getting another custom leather band for this model Timex. What I received is a nylon band with Velcro connector. I was initially dissappointed because it is harder to strap and does not look as good as the leather. However it is functional and works OK once you get use to it.
3,Amelia Bedelia's antics make this a very funny book.,"Amelia Bedelia does not understand things like homophones orhomographs. This causes her to make many mistakes in""interpreting"" what other people tell her to do. The way she does things is strange. And her employers thing so too. This is an easy (quick) read for an 8 year old."
5,A good book by Peggy Parish,"I read a hilarious book called Come Back Amelia Bedelia written by Peggy Parish. Of course Amelia Bedelia is my favorite character. I like her because she seems so friendly but funny. Amelia Bedelia cracks me up because every time she tries to do a job she does it wrong. If I were her I'd keep trying my best. If I could have maid I would pick Amelia Bedelia because she can cook well, ans she isn't hard to get along with. If she left I would be sad. This is why Amelia Bedelia is a good book."
3,Multiple book purchase,"I needed to purchase 7 books for our church. I could only find the books on Amazon but had to purchase them from 6 different individuals. I only received 5 of the books and I was so excited to get them that I did not consider I should record who sent each of the books. I have no idea who I did not get the remaining books from so I am unable to contact them. If you purchase the same item from multiple suppliers, be sure to verify upon receipt who the items were delivered from."
3,WHO WROTE THIS BOOK????,"How can we fairly criticize Mungin's motives, strengths, weaknesses, character, views, etc., when he apparently didn't write the book? What is HIS story out of His own mouth? -- not out of the mouth of a white author who works at the Wall Street Journal. Once again we have a case of a white man speaking for an obviously intelligent and capabable black man (and I notice that Mungin wasn't compensated for this ""story"" -- and apparently this was not a collaboration nor was it ""as told to"" or am I missing something here?). How ""TRUE"" is this supposedly ""True Story""? Mungin is obviously one-dimensional in this book. I'd like to hear his own ""True Story"" in his own words. Mungin where is YOUR book?"
3,Well Written Story,"I was looking forward to reading this book, since I saw both Mungin and Barrett on The Today Show. Barrett wrote a good book. I am sorry that he didn't have more to work with. Mr. Mungin bears some responsibility for his lack of progress. I don't see that his race was the impediment. Big firms seem to only want billable hours and an income stream from its associates on the partnership track. No one was a winner in this situation."
3,Disappointing Technical Problems,"Bought this bundle program and felt very disappointed with its technical problems. First, the installation took very long time - would be fine as it is a one time thing only. Second, the bookmark button is not working. Third - and the most disappointing part is that I could not load the saved game and have to restart the game all over again from the very beginning each and every time - all my collected items etc are lost.Forth, the exercises/games in the Healing/relaxing Rhythms and the Passage/Wisdom Quest used the same games. Those who bought this bundle program would be bored and disappointed.The positive side is - it has beautiful pictures and is quite interesting to play around with. I like the healing rhythms more that the passage/wisdom quest."
4,Customer service is great,"I wanted to use the games for a while before reviewing. The first one I tried was Relaxing Rhythms and it is very good. The second I attempted was Passage, and there I ran into a problem. I would play for a while then save my game. When I came back to it later, it would not reload the saved game and it got pretty tiring having to start over every time I wanted to play. I contacted customer service who helped me down-load a different version of the game which is working perfectly. Great game and game system."
3,"Okay book, standard fantasy story","It was a fast-paced book, which made up for the lack of depth of the characters and their development. I didn't like the way all the females in the book seemed overly macho (Aurian is always swearing and drinking beer, taking ""girl power"" a little too far). Pretty obvious throughout what was going to happen, nice read, not amazingly exciting. Good front cover."
1,"Superficially original, but really derivative schlock","I started reading Aurian because I noticed it had done well and thought that might indicate quality. Wrong.The premise was interesting. The execution was overly structured and stiff, the issues (""see me as a sexually attractive woman, my warrior father-figure!""; evil guy of power wants to use and abuse -- sexually and otherwise -- the virtuous yet flawed protagonist) and the cultures (medieval Europe, the middle east) tired and worn. Aurian reads like the product of an overly long D&D session.However, I kept reading, mostly to see just how predictable and annoying it could get. That was where Aurian did not disappoint. It was awful, and reading it was like poking a bruise: it hurts, but you're fascinated by the pain.And, as another reviewer noted, the last 100-200 pages are nothing but a round robin of ""Mea culpa, mea culpa--we're in danger--mea culpa, mea culpa!""I had forgotten what bad writing is, but this book really reminded me."
3,An adequate read,"A thoroughly unispired book. Though the main characters show some depth, this is vastly overshadowed by the hordes of cardboard cutout characters that make up the rest of the cast. Further, nearly all characterization is the sledge-hammer method: If a character is a coward, you're told he's a coward, rather than being shown his cowardice. While this can be a useful technique, it really gets on the nerves, especially as you're introduced to character after character, thoroughout the book, each one accompanied by a 'resume'. ALl that being said, though, and it's not a bad book. It's readable, and somewhat enjoyable. If you're looking for something to read, and there's scant else, then this is a safe choice."
2,"Great start, but the apologizing grates on your nerves!","Okay, so I liked the book at first. It drew me in quickly, and I was able to get used to yet another world's ""rules and regulation"" (mages are kinda sorta immortal, magic is something that mages store up and deplete, and so on). And it was going pretty well, with the first half of the book about inter-character relationships, and the second half being a journey-type story. But toward the end, I swear, the two main characters are spending more time apologizing to each other than anything else! The amount of time that they spend worrying about having hurt each other's feelings made me wonder if the author has some personal emotional demons that she was trying to deal with through her writing. Toward the very end (I decided to finish it to see if it redeemed itself), I read every other page, just to be able to stomach all of the namby-pamby bull. What a letdown!"
4,The Artifacts of Power,Maggie Furey intwines the senses with this face paced novel. The whole concept of 4 lost artifacts and a great magical war is simply ingenious! In fact this book is so fast paced the books begins with Aurian juggling ice blue fireballs. Mainly this book is about Aurian and her training as a mage at the Academy in the Holy City of Nexis run by the Archmage Miathan! If you love fast paced-books that suck you into them then this is the perfect series for you! I encourage people of all ages to read them...from 10-70 it doesnt matter. Maggie Furey is More than just a writer of words...she is a writer of Fantasy!!
1,More like a soap oprah than a fantasy,"I liked how the writer of this book drew me in and enjoyed the book untill Aurian got to the academy. From there on it wasnt much more than a soap oprah. This book was more distastefull than enjoyable. The only reason I finished it was because I liked Anvar (he reminded me of my husband) and because a friend let me borrow it.It also had way way to much drama in it. I like having peroids to rest and enjoy the story but this was just one drama episode after another. It was like a bowl of soup that had to many crackers in it, dry.I find the Dark Angel books much better than this."
2,RT:,quiero comprar la segunda temporada porque me niegan enviar yo soy cliente dicen no poder enviar a mi direccion si ya me enviaron los otros alli porque este no
5,So excited!!!!!,This is one of my favorite westerns of all time. I have been waiting for this release for three years. It is however in B & W according to the Timeless Media Group website. That doesn't bother me but I thought I should clarify the previous review.
3,Not Color,"According to the product details, this dvd set is supposed to be in color. Not having seen it yet, I can't say for sure. But from what I've been able to find out, this series was not made in color until the third season. I've bought other dvd sets from Amazon that were advertized in color, but turned out to be in black and white. So buyer beware! Still, it was a very good series - I just personally prefer color."
3,Finally I can watch the Laramie I was denied,"As a kid growing up in Geelong, Victoria (Australia) our tv reception during the 1960's was poor for some channels. One of those poor channels broadcast Laramie. I was frustrated in attempting to discern what was going on a very fuzzy tv screen. So now well into my middle age I can finally watch, in great digital remastered format, those Laramie episodes I missed out on way back in my youth.Whether it is watching Wagon Train or Rawhide or Laramie I believe that compared to modern television the story telling was fresh and less predictable other than the fact the stars of the series would come through each adventure victorius. These old westerns remind of my introduction to the world of drama. I can't seem to get enough."
4,I love Laramie,"Laramie is one of my favorite westerns and I enjoyed these episodes. They could have been a little better quality, but I think the imperfections make them more realistic. The one thing that annoyed me greatly and the reason for 4 stars for this product is that only 1 of the disks stays attached to its box. The others slide around inside their box and fall out when the boxes are opened. I can't find any excuse for that.I give the show itself 5+ stars."
1,D.O.A.,"Energizer ER-C5160 NICKEL-METAL HYDRIDE EXTENDED BATTERY. These batteries that I bought and Paid for Brand new $24.00 A piece for. Should really say Yes BRAND NEW Never used. BUT ABSOLUTLEY PASSED THEIR SHELF LIFE. these batteries are rated to hold a seven hour run on my Sony VX3 Hi 8 Camcorder. I could not get one to pass a half hour. PERIOD. test them your self if you like I even ran them through a REFRESHER CHARGE. SORRY Charlie. Now to be fair if these batteries are freshly manufactured yes the could and most probably would hold that charge, BUT THESE BATTERIES DONT SHOW A MANUFACTURES DATE."
4,Great Book,"This is a good resource book, just wish it had a laminated cheat sheet to carry around of all the logo's with the dates.I can't keep all the info in my head! I found a salesman sample waffle iron the other day, but thanks to my book I knewit was a remake they did in 1990 or so, but since it was priced at $250 I wouldn't have bought it anyway! But good bookglad I bought it!Thanks!"
3,Missing piece,"Major overlook. The Indians did not cut down many trees, but changed the forest ecology dramatically by burning out the underbrush once or twice a year in massive fires, so that they could move and hunt more freely (and move silently). This omission spoils the understanding of forest life by injecting a modern political angle of environmentalism that would be better left out."
2,Disappointed,Just purchased one of these from this website. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
3,Too tiny,I didn't realize the humidifier would be so tiny. It just didn't have the manpower I needed in my house so I returned it to Amazon.
3,return,This order is a purchase warranty. The one it is replacing had problems with less than 30 days of use.
3,humidifier,THis product is small and easy to clean but not sure how well it humidifies a room as nothing is steamy in the morning. Worth the money though.
4,i like it,I have the regular jogger but it is too big for my suitcasethis one will fit nicely in my bag and I can jog in the hotel pools
4,great read,A great read for fans of the genre. I just wish they would reissue book one of the series so I could read how it all began.
5,Just Enough Light for the Step I'm On,"""Just Enough Light"" was given to me as a gift after a freak accident where I broke both of the bones in my lower leg and became immobilized with a long leg cast and confined to a wheelchair. I am a healthcare executive and my life runs at a hectic pace. The inability to walk was truly ""crippling""! I had no idea how I was going to survive this tragedy! Then I started to read Stormie Omartian's book. It became my morning devotions. The Prayer Light and Footlights sections were perfect to help me focus on God's will in my life and helped me to be patient (not a strong suit for me!) I recommend this easy and quick read book to anyone who is struggling with ""tough times"" in their life. You will find your own personal situation on the pages of this book and find strength. One of the best books I have ever read. It has helped me find the ""light"" to get through my healing process."
5,A book to share,"This is a book to read for yourself, and to share with others. Recently a friend, who had been in a car accident and also was worried for the sufferings of two families close to her, said to me ""Why does God allow all this to happen? It's too much!"" I didn't have the words to answer. But with this book, I now have something I can pass on to her that may help. I plan to keep extra copies, to share with others going through difficult times in their lives, as we all do!"
5,Comforting,"It is because of Stormie that I have grown much closer to our LORD. She has a way of just talking to you and you feel like she is your friend. I have read most of her books and passed them on!Don't put her books away, share them with your friends and family! They will enrich their lives as well!I love her books and recommend her HIGHLY!"
3,Lessens learned from first purchase.,"This was the book I intended to buy, but I wanted the large print edition. Even though I sent questions to seller, I didn't hear back. This info helps me to be sure that I know exactly what I am getting. I do not count this purchase as a loss, however."
2,Just Enough light for the Step I'm on.,I bought this book for a Bible Study class that I am attending. I have never before taken a class like this through a non professor. This book is required . I thought it is very simplistic and dumb! Made on alot of assumtions.
3,Cliches for everybody!,"I bought this because I like John Cusack and Netflix does not have this movie. It does have an excellent cast including Patrick Swayze and Jamie Lee Curtis but is your typical 80's movie. The main character wants to do one thing after high school but his dad wants him to do something else and at the same time he gets involved in a love triangle...blah blah blah. Oh yeah, some big business guy, who is the kid's dad wants to build a country club or something on Jamie Lee Curtis's failing demolition derby. It is an average movie that is not worth watching unless you love the or these actors."
3,Just another B movie,"Not great acting, but it is special to us as the majority was filmed in our hometown, Pontiac, IL and many friends were extras."
5,"Find your values, vission and mission",don't judge a book by the cover and its size because it may have the information which can change your life. and this book is one among them. If you are searching for a POA for your life just stop by and get this small book and read it. My special thanks to Duncan for writing such a book.
5,Coulter's best book,"This was one of the first romance novels I ever read, was the first Catherine Coulter I read, and I still consider it her BEST!!! This is an EXCELLENT book!! I just had to add my recommendation to anyone wanting a fun read that had me, at times, laughing out loud. (By the way, it is the only one I liked of the bride series; I despise the marital rape in Hellion Bride, and Sinjin was disappointingly weak in Heiress Bride.)"
4,Good read,"I've read at least 15 books of Catherine Coulter. I only gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 because unlike some of her novels, this one had a weird male lead who sometimes act like an idiot and a savage person. Another thing, no one could possibly be that beautiful and perfect, as far as the heroine's sister is concerned. Melissande was a typical character who is very attractive so she's spoiled and rotten due to all the attention she gets. But the book still managed to provoke feelings such as happiness, sadness, irritation and excitement throughout the time I read it. I would not tell the story so I won't ruin it for those who have not read it yet but it is delightful!"
3,Misses the mark,"The story was wonderful, but it just misses the mark. The components are there for a superior story, but it remained undeveloped. Douglas's treatment of Alexandra was disappointing. The dialog was stilted and not believable. Compared to Johanna Lindsey's character development and riveting exchanges, it was a disappointment."
4,A wedding by proxy,"Douglas finds his world turned upside down by a slip of a girl who he finds himself wed by proxy to. His cousin ends up marrying the woman he wanted to marry and Douglas gets stuck with the sister. Elizabeth refuses to give up on this man that she has loved for years. I had a hard time not giving up on Douglas reading this story because he is so full of himself and thinks himself in control of every situation. At times he's very cold to Elizabeth but at the moment I was ready to give up on him, he would do something redeeming and I would be sucked back in. I'm glad that I stayed because under all his gruffness is a man who can love as fiercely as he can be cold. Lots of great characters in this book who will keep you laughing and a few whom I found no liking for. His cousin and Elizabeth's sister will keep you smiling. I enjoyed reading as Douglas opened himself up to feeling and Elizabeth fought for the man she loved."
2,Not Too Good...,"This story was interesting, I suppose, but Douglas was a complete imbecile. He was so mean to Alexandra; not just rude, but very insulting. He told her to her face how unattractive he found her. If this girl had any pride - or a spine - she'd have fled fast. Why exactly did he end up falling in love with Alexandra? Nothing seemed to have changed in the story. And God only knows what she saw in him; it certainly wasn't kindness."
3,Is this supposed to be a romance?,"I hated Douglas. He was nothing but mean to Alex, constantly reminding her that he didn't want to marry her, he wanted to marry her beautiful sister. Even at the end of the book, I didn't feel like he loved her.I gave it 3 stars because Alex is absolutely delightful! She is constantly abusing Douglas in one way or another - just what he deserves!!I've read the sequels, and they all show Douglas and Alex so in love. I just don't see it."
2,Didn't expect it will be so bad,"I like ""Lord Harry"" very much and expected this one will be good also. Big disappointment. It is not even close to a smart and funny story of ""Lord Harry""."
2,Early Sound Holmes,"Raymond Massey makes an interesting Holmes in this early sound film based on the Conan Doyle story. It is primitive, but worth a look."
2,Saddened by product's insufficient bubble wrap shipping,I was so hopeful about this product for a Christmas present for my husband. It arrived in a bubble envelope with more bubble wrap around the mug. So the top of the handle had been loosened from the mug during transit- i was so close to Christmas that I got competent advice on how to properly secure it back to the mug.That was the first hurdle from the mug being shipped in a not secure enough method ( IT NEEDED TO BE IN A FIRM HEAVY ENOUGH BOX) Then When my husband froze the mug for the first time and put some cool water in the mug the mug had sustained a micro crack during shipping that I had not seen and cracked all the way through and the water ran every where. My husband gave it back to me - I was pretty embarrised - Havent figured what to do with it...
5,A seminal work,"I can't say enough how much this book has been a source of insight to me. It is a serious work, but it is very well written and quite accessible.He explores in this book as he does in others, the hidden and emotional sides of social bonds. Our ambivalence about athorinty is the subject of the book. John Locke thought all we had to do was get rid of kings to be free, but Sennet and the rest of us know we are still not free. why?read this and start to at least ask some of the right questions."
2,no practical information..,"After reading the hardware portion, I feel that I have waste half of my money. As an engineer, I personally think the hardware portion on this book is simply too simple. It is almost totally not helpful to engineer, but may be useful to software person. However, I really do not think that embedded programmer need to know the hardware detail up to CMOS transistor in RAM.The example of micropocessor in this book are mainly some microprocessor which is specific for TV application. I think some more general microcontroller should be used, since I think there arent many people are familiar with TV processor. [...]In conclusion, I would rather recommend to have seperate book on hardware and software which use the specific hardware and software that meet your needs."
4,Some reader notification!,"I've bought this book a month ago and just read through it.This book is okay for me, who has background in electronics. However, some chapters, particularly hardware and software device driver, are too brief and I don't think that the beginner will be able to understand. The content in some chapter is just duplicate, which I think it is redundancy. Also, the fonts used to label in many figures are stumble. However, it is a good book for reference in the embedded system area overall."
5,Jack Ganssle Recommendation,"I was impressed when I learned that Jack Ganssle not only wrote the foreward, but also said""This book fills a void. Most books address only portions of the embedded problem. As the title indicates, this one is uniquely comprehensive. I consider it a must-read.""Jack Ganssle, embedded author, lecturer, consultantHe was right, as usual, I was not disappointed."
2,Targeted at management,"No real information here. If you were to read only this book front to back you'd be able to put on a good show in a meeting or conversation, but still be completely unable to get any real work done. A good book for a technical manager who doesn't actually need to know anything...only sound as if they do."
3,A good overview in embedded system architecture,"From architecture point of view, this book is a good overview. For a person totally new to the embedded system design, this book provides a comprehensive and clear explanation of the components in the embedded system. There are a lot of figures in the book and is very illustrative. I feel that the hardware section and the system design section is clear and very helpful. But the software section is not very well written. The author tried to explain software components through examples. But these examples are too specific and failed to give a clear vision in general.A big problem with the book is that it contains too many typos and errors. For someone familiar with embedded system, it doesn't matter. But this book is mainly useful for a newbie in this field. These errors can then be confusing sometimes."
2,This is not an architecture book,"This book collects many bits and pieces of the vast field of embedded systems, without clear illustration to concepts. It's neither instructional nor a comprehensive handbook. The attempt to cover hardware [...] is far less successful than the software part, which provides some good coverage of OS, middleware and application layers. Coverage of tools is weak. Fonts for some codes and graphs are too small to read. I suggest beginners go to one of those hands-on books targeting one microcontroller, and those experienced go to those more specialized books. [...]"
5,Excellent coverage of embedded system,"As its title indicates, this is a comprehensive guide book that provides excellent overview of embedded system. This might have been indended for college students and inexperienced engineers, but this could be recommended even to experienced engineers. I have been an embedded software professional for more than twenty years, but I still have learned a lot from this book, or at least this book refreshed my memory. I wish I had this text book when I was a college student. Especially this book has excellent coverage of embedded software, and hardware portion is also good for software engineers. From that sense, I recommend this book to software people more than to hardware engineers. Highly recommended."
1,"Lacks power, push button very cheap","I installed this on my '00 Camry today. The solonoid simply has too little power and travel to be effective. While the travel is sufficient for my application, it may not be for yours. The spring tension on my latch is not strong at all, but this thing can only pull it open one out of two times. Unacceptable. The push button is also terrible, but even on a relay, this solonoid just will not perform. Look elsewhere."
2,Don't waste money on this.,"This product works fine, just not for my car. I have a 240sx hatch and with the hatch open the solenoid will function. With the hatch closed the solenoid barely tugs at the spring latch. I've tried adjusting the tension on the wire cable with no luck. Just a little bit of slack and still won't pop open. Too tight and the door won't shut because the tension on the cable is keeping the latch open. Even when I found a happy medium, feels like the solenoid barely flicks the latch.This item may work with trunks that are very light, but not for heavy trunk doors/hatch."
1,very week,The solenoid doesn't have enough power to open up a trunk. You have to get creative in order for this thing to work. May work great for other applications just not as a trunk release.
2,Despite the reviews I purchased anyway,"Despite the reviews I purchased anyway. Installation was easy, diagrams were easy to follow. Solenoid pulls the lock fine when testing with a screw driver, but when my trunk latches it, the solenoid does not have enough power to pop the trunk. Would have loved to give this 5 stars, but unfortunately I now need to buy a different solenoid and throw this one in the trash."
1,Too weak to open trunk,"I installed this into a Honda Civic, and the solenoid was too weak to open the trunk latch.The push button is also poorly made - the threads for the plastic nut that holds the button in place did not match well with the button. I had to silicone the button in place so that it would hold.Wires are also too short.I would not recommend this purchase."
3,"A Creative Look at Shapes -- A review of the ""Calico Cat Looks at Shapes""","We picked up the first Calico Cat book at the library and quite liked it as a primer for our beginning reader. This book however is not a reader, and is actually targeted to babies and toddlers learning their shapes. And there are so many books in the `shape' category that it is hard to give any one of them a rave review.But one of the things that this books does well is to show the shapes in different ways. Besides showing Calico Cat in a box (square), for example, the author and artist show him/her hopping down sidewalk squares.Shapes discussed are: squares, circles, rectangles, triangles, half circles, ovals, and crescents. In addition, the book also discusses the `petal' shape which I don't think I've ever run across in any other `shape' book.Three Stars. At these prices I'd consider taking a look at this book if your baby or toddler likes either cat's or this series."
3,"Great classic comedy, ok dvd release","I love this movie, I always have. So when I found out that it is on DVD I had to buy it. So the picture quality is DVD quality, but there is no main menu! Which mean no special features or subtitles!!! Why? No one knows. So if you are a die hard fan of this movie, by all means BUY IT!! It's most likely the only chance you will get to own it on DVD."
5,Neighbors Should Be Released on DVD!,"This is I feel the best movie that John Belushi ever played in. It is also my favorite movie! This is a really off-beat movie. It has its spooky, quirky and simply funny and entertaining parts also! I know that a lot of movie critics did not like this movie, but the first time I seen it on cable (HBO) I went out and bought it. I wish this movie was released on DVD but to date I have not found it. To me it is a classic that deserves to be put on disc. The rest of the cast played great parts also! I would highly recommend this movie as it is entertaining and extremely funny!"
5,Please release this film..........,"I`m writing this review just to help push for the release of this movie on DVD, I got to watch it a very long time ago, like 1982............when I was in 2nd grade & I barely remember any of it...........C`mon people, release this for everyone who has never got to see this move or the ones who don`t remember much about it......."
4,Wierd but Funny Movie,"If you want to see some of John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd's wierdest humor, this is it. One of their stranger movies that never hinted where it was going until it got there."
4,neighbors dvd,"it is one of my favorite movies. the dvd worked fine.ihad no problems with it.the quality was good,no isues.i recommend this dvd."
4,It's about time this came out!,"I'm only giving this 4 stars. There is currently no blu-ray available even though this was made from the newly remastered HD scan.I watched this on my 64"" Samsung and it up-scaled very nicely. It's unfortunate there is no release on bluray."
2,Strange move on a cheep budget,"I know htis movie was given 4 and 5 stars, I like John Belushi and Dan but this was a very slow pace and just plan movie. If you like dard or black humor, this is the movie for you."
4,Please release it on DVD!,"The story goes that Aykroyd was originally cast as the timid home owner and Belushi was the loud outrageous neighbor. When they sat down to read the script for the first time together, they were halfway through it when John suddenly said, ""we've played these characters before. It's the same old thing."" Dan thought and said, ""wanna switch?""Danny's played loud and boisterous before (and since) but this is the first (and last) time John has ever played a straight man, and THAT'S what makes this film special. By playing it straight John shows us what a good actor he really was, and Danny brings to his role his own special maniacal dementia that he was so adept at (remember the bass-o-matic salesman?). I don't know if a grassroots campaign on amazon will give the necessary push to get this movie released on DVD, but here's hoping!"
3,"Raw, honest, repetitious.","I agree with other reviewers, this stuff is pretty heavy, but I'm not buying that Rollins has actually killed people. If he wanted to make all this horror seem real he should have left out the unbelievable stuff.I did enjoy reading the book (I liked the long stuff better than the shorter pieces) though it was repetitious at times. I like his take on dating (Mekanik) and his hatred for drugs, guns, and crime is commendable. I will definitely be reading more Rollins in the future."
3,The Good and the Bad,"I'm really mixed about this book because as other reviews had stated, it is very repetetive, almost like Henry Rollins picked up a thesaurus and picked different words that mean the same thing just to get the same story told over and over again.I could never abandon my love for his mind, he's great (not much of a fan of his music) when it comes to telling a story or picking out his feelings and thoughs, but most of his books just seem to repeat the same story.I do recommend it highly to anyone who likes to read, but this one reads more like a coffee table book than a ""lay in bed all day and read"" book."
4,decent,"the book is quite interesting, I don't know about the leaving of the reader in disgust, but I do know it is quite cool, how the words are formated, so the hating towards other people is outloudly noticed."
3,"If you want dysfunctional, this is it.","EYE SCREAM, is the first and only book of Rollin's that I've read. If it stayed that way, I would be ok. Don't misunderstand me, the book wasn't bad, it was that good. Truth, hate, violence, sex, hypocracy... Henry takes it all on in this book. However mind numbing this book is, it can be enjoyed by most everyone with morals or a stadard of quality. If you want to witness the rawness of humanity, this is a book not to pass over."
1,"Frightening,mildly entertaining,mostly horrible.","Rollins used to be my hero. I found out about him through a videotape concert of him,and my buddy dubbed me a cheap copy of ""The End of Silence"". In my 19 year old, Mellaril/Tegretol infused angry mind, Henry was the best thing ever. I bought all his books mindlessly thinking his was my personal hero,getting me through the rough years before I could get past the high school/hometown torture angst.This book is filled with his angry,social Darwinian,pseudo-murderous (...). It has no value whatsoever,he writes the same (...) over and over...""I'm angry,you people are below me,society is ruined,blahblahblah"" and talks about cutting up people a lot.Henry is only good when he's being funny. I'm sorry I bought this book."
2,Oud Player,"Turkish Oud with Hard CaseOud, Turkish with Hard CaseFor the price, this isn't too bad. You'll have a hard time getting a student OUd for less than $300. That being said, the instrument is low quality but playable. The pegs leave a little be be desired, but if you apply some peg compound (for violins) it helps keep it in tune.Also, keep in mind that if you are just learning to play the Oud, this one is tuned EABead (Turkish) vs. CFAdgc (Arabic) and most of the materiels available are for Arabic tunings. I would suggest you spend some time researching online before commiting to an oud that won't meet your needs long term.That being said, in terms of convenience, I purchased this oud from Andreas Inc and it was sent overnight... so I have NO problems with the seller... it's just that the quality of the instrument is pretty low... but then again, the price is pretty low too."
1,Questionable probative value,"Carmichael has been discredited. To the extent that ""Black Power"" induced Afro-Americans to step up the pace and scope of black advancement in our society, it was a positive and welcome influence. To the extent that BP was the precursor to current-day notions of mindless multiculturalism and ""institutional racism"" it did us all, black and white, a grave insult. For an example of what oppression REALLY looks like, see Cuba."
2,Interesting but low level,"The book is interesting, but if you are looking for a good book about the warehousing I'd recommend another one. It is the right book if you don't know anything of warehouses and facilities.This book spends a lot of pages in the Appendix (50%).Futhermore the regulations are USA ones, so if you don't live in the USA you don't need to know them.Order this item if you are a novice and order another if you are a logistics executive."
1,I threw it away,"This is the worst book you can buy for LSAT prep. Horrible explanations, fatuous advice, stupid tricks that actually muddle your thinking. Do NOT waste your time on this piece of garbage."
1,"Horrible, just horrible.","Wasted 30 bucks and three of my study days on this poor excuse for a prep book. The possible answers to the questions were misleading and confusing enough, but reading the actual solution to why an answer is correct, that was just hell.I highly suggest practicing off actual LSAT questions (Barron's contain ""model"" questions that aren't from the actual LSAT's).This is a horrible, horrible, prep book."
1,Don't buy it!,"This is a highly poor edition to study for the LSAT. One of the main reasons has to do with the fact that, unlike the real LSAT, which has rigorous controls to ensure that 1) test questions are quite similar to past tests; 2) that there is no ambiguous language that would confuse or create potentially two accurate answers . . . but this book has no such protections to guarantee the accuracy or quality of the test questions.Instead, I would highly recommend the LSAT takers purchase a book from the Law School Admission Council, which sells actual past LSAT exams.What we seek to do is earn high scores on the actual LSAT test; we really do not care how Barron's will rate us. So we must take a test that is as close to a real LSAT test as humanly possible. Simply put, this book fails that test.-- Michael GordonLos Angeles"
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY,"This book was worse than useless. It confused me, made me feel stupid, and brought down my score. The analytical and logical reasoning sections of this book were at best irrelevant, at worst misleading, and often just wrong. Suggestions in the reading comprehension section were appalingly obvious. Do yourself a favor - do not buy this book - and tell everyone you know not to buy this book."
1,Please do not buy,"Luckily I just took this book out from the library and didn't waste my money on it.Please, please, please do not buy or use this book. It is a waste of time. Unfortunately sometimes the only way to find this out is to use the book yourself. Please though believe my review and the others (who rate it low). I wasted about a week and a half. Perhaps I learned some basic reading comp. tactics, but that's about it.I just bought Master the LSAT by Nova. Haven't used it yet, but the reviews (which I should have believed for this book) are pretty high."
1,There are MUCH better books out there...,"I am so mad at this book. The questions were poorly worded, the strategies weren't very helpful, some of the questions has wrong answers (I mean totally wrong)..The worst thing of all was that the last test was so easy, it was obviously an attempt to make you believe that the book helped you to improve to a near-perfect score. I thought I was a moron because I was still scoring low on real LSAT's. Then I bought Cracking the LSAT and Master the LSAT and ended up scoring where I wanted to. This book is recommnended only if you are taking the LSAT in 2 days, haven't studied, and this is the only book you can find."
4,Good addition to the Mahjongg library,This book has excellent graphics. Good introduction to the 3 variations of the game without all the complications added by Western players using the American/Jewish or Officers Wives clubs.
4,Good Book on Mah Jong,"This is one of the better books on mah jong, but I'm still left with a few questions that need to be cleared up where she wasn't specific enough. Other than that, great pictures, very clear diagrams and good explanations of Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, and 12-tile Mah Jong. And it's written by a native Mah Jong player, not just a westerner who's been there once or twice; someone who has been playing it for her whole life in China."
3,"Decent Quality Conversion, Decent Item","This product is just what it appears to be, and while it works well, it does not stand out from its peers in any particular way. Direct adapters such as this typically provide a much higher quality of sound than FM transmission devices, but do not think you will avoid static entirely, as dirt and dust will collect on the tape heads.One thing I wish I had considered before purchasing it is the color, very few vehicles have a white tape deck, so the cord leading from the tape deck is quite obvious, and you may wish to pop this out and put it in your glove compartment if you live in an area where theft is a problem (as people will assume the device to which it connects may also be in the car).Aside from that caveat, this is a good item which has served me well since I purchased it on Amazon over a year ago."
1,Cassette doesn't work well,"This cassette isn't the one that is pictured and it is bad quality. I wasn't expecting anything great, but it is worse than my broken one, where I have to wrap the wire around the plug for it to work. I was hoping to get a replacement for it, but I guess I'll just have to stick with the old one. What a waste of $4."
3,THE PARTY'S OVER,"Flores Forbes told a very moving/disturbing story but one that excludes many details regarding his early violent past as an underground operative.There are many holes in Forbe's version of his botched 1978 hit on an elderly woman. While the elderly woman's story never makes it in Forbe's book it did make it in the NEW TIMES Magazine in October of 1978 and she reveals a completely different story or at least provides a story. The Black Panther Party that Forbes speaks of is not the same one that he joined in 1969 but one that lost direction after repeated attacks/murder from a gun happy Police force and an out of control FBI agency.A worthy read would be PANTHER ON THE PROWL by Elbert ""BIGMAN Howard one of the first members to join The Black Panther Party"
2,"Sketchy, shallow","The section that I like best in this book is the interview with Ann Richards. The other anecdotes and advice I found to be superficial, glib, and trite.A few selections:""Let's face it. Breaking up with someone you care for is never easy."""". . . be careful when you're dating. Take time to get to know another person."""". . . do an little analysis before attending an activity. Make sure it is one that interests you, not just one where you'll meet someone.""It's not bad advice, and probably not a bad first book for someone who is alone for the first time. But someone aching from a divorce or death might need something more compassionate, deeply-felt, and thoroughly researched."
4,A Breath of Fresh Air.,"""The Ten Thousand"" is a breath of fresh air to what had been a stale genre- military fiction. When I began to read I braced myself for another of Harold Coyle's dull Clancy clones, yet I found myself enjoying ""The Ten Thousand"" immensely.The story- the fanatically anti-American leader of Germany captures nuclear weapons taken by U.S. forces from the Ukraine, forcing the U.S. Army's X Corps to fight their way across a hostile country to recover the weapons - is a welcome change from the renegade Russia scenarios that authors like Dale Brown cannot break free from.The historical allusions to Xenephon's Ten Thousand and the medieval warfare were wonderful for this ex-history major to read. Coyle clearly put some thought into this story.The only flaws to Coyle's story are his unrealistic portrayals of the decision-making process in Washington."
1,I'd laugh if it wasn't so sad.,"The authors vita says that he was once stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army. I'm astonished how he could, in the light of his experiences, write such a plot. I can only presume that he himself really knows how highly improbable (in fact, concerning German law, constitution and officer training, as impossible as the ressurection of slavery in the U.S.) this storyline is and that he simply cobbled it together to have a background for his admittedly excellent skills in describing land battles and technology.As it is, even at the time of its creation the background of ""The Ten Thousand"" was extremely implausible. It sadly speaks volumes that a man who used to be a soldier of the very nation responsible for turning Germany into a pacifist and largely apathetic nation understands German society so little."
4,Realistic and possible arms race residue.,"Harold Coyle opens with an assault to prevent some nuclear weapons from the now defunct USSR. A weapon is detonated underground by the defenders, wiping out half of the weapons. Now an American force of ten thousand become the custodians of the remaining weapons. They are in Germany, what should be friendly soil but somehow a mixture of pride and old hatreds that make up the Germany of today come to play to make it a very hostile place. The former West German soldiers now stand side by side with former East German enemies to stop the Americans. And the Americans must follow their leader in a march to the sea or surrender. Washington has issued orders to surrender and no help will come, but the commander is adamant. To surrender would put the nuclear weapons in questionable hands. He and the ten thousand will fight."
5,Classic!!,US attempts to stop nuclear proliferation by stealing nukesfrom central European country. Only problem is that a newly revivedmilitaristic Germany wants the stolen nukes for themselves and prevents US Army forces safe transit through Germany. Vivid description of combat.
2,Feminism is an unnecessary distraction,"My teenage son and I were listening to the audio edition on the way to work this morning. Ten minutes into a feminist rant about young LT Ellerby's anti-feminist attitude, my son commented: ""He [Coyle] has an axe to grind...""We concluded that Harlod Coyle has seriously damaged his credibility by injecting feminist politics into a military adventure novel. I seriously doubt he opened a new female market with this endeavor and I'll be reluctant to buy any more of his books"
2,A decent old-style battery,"A good replacement battery for older Panasonic VHS videocameras, the CV3112 is easily subject to the ""memory effect:"" if one does not fully discharge the battery before recharging the usable charge becomes less over time--sometimes quite rapidly.The battery can be left in a *conditioning* (""smart"") recharger, but not in the ones that come with most of these videocameras. The best strategy is to have two batteries available; run one dry and switch to the other."
5,Great Stuff,"I am very impressed with this product! I used this on a boating trip in the Mediterranean. I spent all my time, even slept nights, on the deck. No bites even with very light coverage! I was hesitant to purchase this product at first secondary to the reviewers who commented on the unpleasant smell. I did not find the smell to be at all offensive. I was on the boat with 16 other people and all spontaneously commented on the pleasant smell."
2,Works but...stinks,"I am all for trying more natural products, however this time I think I will go back to my national brand. It seemed to work well, however the smell was something that I did not appreciate - and I DO like natural smells. This stuff smells EXACTLY like horse fly spray that we spray on horses. Maybe a man would not care as much, but all I needed was a little whiff of alfalfa and I would have been transported back to a pasture somewhere. In addition, the ""spray"" was more of a stream of a white substance that needs to be rubbed in. I could not have sprayed it on my clothing to keep the 'skitos off my shirt and back. I am going to keep searching."
2,All Terrain Herbal Armor Deet - Free natural Insect Repellent,"This is not a spray but a lotion. I used it on playing golf in one morning, I did not get any insect bite. However, the smell of the lotion stayed with me for over 5 hours. The smeil was pretty strong and my playing partners didn't want to get too close to me. I have not used it since."
5,A Winner,I bought this product after reading about it in the New York Times. Our yard is infested with Asian Tiger mosquitoes and this really keeps them at bay. Herbal Armor works as well as any DEET product we've used. Excellent product.
4,Works but smell is strong,"This was by far one of the first insect repellents I've used that works. Areas where I sprayed the repellent went untouched or bitten by insects. Areas that I happen to miss were bitten by insects. Be careful to spray and spread out manually by hand to avoid missing any spots on your skin. One thing I didn't like about this product was the smell, it was very strong and after a while nauseating."
1,Skin reactions,"This product is a bit more thick, and sprays onto skin less in a fine mist, more of smaller jets of whitish fluid.It seems to work, in that bugs don't bite you while you're wearing it. My kids seem to like it just fine. I have tried it 3 times now, and won't be using it again because it causes my skin to have an itching and burning feeling. As it is absorbed into the skin, it becomes more difficult to wash off, and so the burning feeling persists. It's not extremely painful, but it's quite irritating, much like putting something like vaporub on yourself."
1,DO NOT USE if allergic to bees,I am severely allergic to bees and this stuff REALLY attracted them. My yard has very few bees. . I sprayed this stuff on as I also has a mosquito allergy. Oh man. What a bummer it was when I got stung for the first time in 10 years. Not only that it attracted many gnats and other small flying creatures. I will never ever use this stuff again.
4,"Good product, smell is a little much","My son is usually a magnet for any bug outdoors, since using this product it has been MUCH better. He does still come in with a bite or two, but compared to before I will take that any day. The smell, a little too much for me, although my kids like the smell... I just don't at all!"
2,Wish it had worked...,"I used this product when I heard a mosquito flying around my room while I was trying to sleep. They usually go for whatever they can get to, ie my face! So, I sprayed herbal armor on a tissue, and dabbed it on my face.Whew, the smell was waay too strong for me...and I like essential oils...But I wanted to endure it because it's deet free.So, we're talking one mosquito to fend off...and it bit me twice on my face almost immediately!Does anyone know if there is a non toxic repellent?2 stars because it's a great idea! Wish it had worked."
2,"No matter how much you shake the bottle, it doesn't come out right.","No matter how much you shake the bottle, it doesn't come out right. It shoots out in foaming bursts and you have to rub it in with your hands. And then that awful bug spray smell is on your hands. I will be moving on to other natural bug sprays."
2,Works Great BUT Attracts Bee's,"I am really pleased with this product in regards to Mosquitos, Fleas, and the pesky sweat-nats. It washes off with no lingering smell easily enough. The only downside is that, for me at least, the product seems to attract bees. They tend to swarm around both myself and also items where my hands, after application, have rested. (Lawnmower, lawn tools, and event the bottle)While I love bee's, I prefer not to provoke a fight with them."
1,Worthless,"I doused myself and my son in this, and got bitten all over. I was so excited by all the positive reviews, but it did nothing to keep the mosquitoes away. It is also pretty greasy. I should mention that I live in Michigan, where mosquitoes get pretty bad in the summer. We ended going back to the DEET products, which are the only ones that work for us. :-("
1,do not risk it,"Not only does this not seem to have any effect on mosquitoes, it attracts bees. They are drawn to the bottle and were drawn to me (I was stung). I threw it away and washed the kids."
1,Florid style covers up any actual information book may or may not contain,"When I got this book, I expected a history of our calendar and its links to the ancient world written for regular people as opposed to scholars. The writing is fluid, but so florid that it's hard to get actual information out of it. The writing is so self-indulgently flowery that it disguises the message rather than delivering it. Since the subject matter is in fact nonfiction, this is not a particularly effective style.There are a lot of books out there on the history of the calendar that ARE readable, even to the non-academic. This one is not worth buying."
3,An Imaginative Time Journey thru the Ages,"As a general reader, I liked the author's poetical, appreciative and sometimes fascinatingly historical, journey thru the months of the year, from antique times onward. Beneath the simplicity of style lies the author's spirit, wisdom and humor - and I think you can't get all the information on the first reading. Besides the months & seasons, there's the holidaze celebrations. In all, this is an imaginative book."
5,An American Poet,"Osing is one of the country's finest and most complex talents, making music of abstract thought and at the same time heavy on irony and concrete imagery. Don't listen so much to the intellectual blather he inspires but rather more to those who have found the Buddah inside him that makes him a celebrant. He is primarily a decadent,exquisite giggler who delights more in the expression of a notion than its practicality. His book is a five star outing on the Orient, but derives from Missouri."
2,Not that hot,"I was looking elsewhere, seeing this stuff rated at 500,000-700,000 scoville units. I don't think so. I can put a spoonful of this directly on my tongue, and the burn is very mild. It's also very sweet. If sweet with a mild burn is what you are looking for, go for it. Otherwise try something else."
4,"Almost perfect, except for those long earrings","I purchased this item about a year ago and love it. It's got style, has a nice weight behind it, and holds many pairs of earrings. The only issue I have is that my long, dangly earrings definitely don't have enough room to hang here, nor do the big hoops. If you're a hoop person, consider finding an earring holder that has a bit more space between the different levels, which are about 1.25 - 1.5 inches apart.One other thing I noticed is that several of the bars have an odd number of holes in them. It's more of an A-type thing than anything else, but those extra holes go to waste for me because I don't want to hang one earring on one bar and the other earring a rung down."
4,Nice,"It's a very nice piece, although it was bigger than I expected. It's about a foot tall, and will definitely hold plenty of earrings. I needed an item like this, because my earrings end up in a pile and tangled. This is good to hold all types, hoops, studs, and dangly earrings."
5,5 Gold Stars,This is well worth the purchase. Strong and sturdy with an elegant appearance. No complaintsFast shipping prompt servce
3,if only it didn't arrive broken,"I really like this product. But I was unimpressed when I opened the box to find the stand broken off from the holder. The item is currently being fixed by a friend, So I have not gotten to use it yet. However, I do recommend the item."
5,great vitamins,"My doctor has these vitamins for his paitents to purchase, they work well and they make you feel good. more energized and the PM make it easier to unwind at the end of the day. I recomend them."
1,Waste of Money and Time - Don't Buy This Book!,"I purchased this book without looking through it first and am extremely disappointed. While it did provide some good advice on what not to include in a personal statement, the sample essays provided seemed trivial and senseless. Also, the book seems to be written for kids still in college and recent grads, and focuses mostly on medical and law school admissions. It totally ignores working adults and people seeking admission into other graduate programs, such as human services and education. The time I wasted reading this book could have been better spent actually writing my own admissions essay!"
1,Useless and insulting,"Do not buy this book.It's advice is useless at best, insulting at worst. It is full of idiotic phrases such as ""use your creativity to..."" that are too abstract to be actually helpful. It relies on jargon and a casual tone, which good writing books eschew. The only concrete advice it gives is so obvious as to be disconcerting. What graduate school applicant wouldn't already know not to misspell the name of the university? What kind of mutant would find this book helpful?Only the collection of actual essays and responses from admissions boards at the end of the book made me not wholly regret spending $4 (including shipping) on this waste of trees. Still, I wish I had my $4 back, along with my belief that the pool of graduate school applicants weren't foolish egotists with no social skills, self-awareness, or basic understanding of the expectations the professional world has for them."
1,Not Worth Giving Away,I just glanced at one essay in this book and I found horrible grammatical errors such as failing to Capitilize the name of a university. I'm glad I didn't buy it and hope no one else does either.
2,Plagiarism,"There are whole sections of this book that are lifted, word for word, straight out of Burton Rose's Clinical Physiology of Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders, without any attribution. Just sayin'."
2,"OK overview, but better alternatives exist...","The book offers a good overview of information security, though with a lot of ""talk"". I found myself scanning 75% of the paragraphs for the meat....I'm a software engineer, and have read ""Secret's and Lies"", which offers a much more thorough and better review of the subject. Buy it, instead. Not only will you get a better education, but you'll actually read the entire book instead of skimming most of it....Neither this nor ""Secrets and Lies"" will offer much specific information on security loopholes, i.e. how to hack or avoid being hacked. ""Hacking Exposed"" does that, however, and is a good read, too."
1,You get what you pay for,"These movies are wonderful examples of the genre, but the worst transfers I have ever seen. If you want to be reminded of what these movies looked like on late-night TV in the 1970s, this is the collection for you. The movies look like they were duped off a VCR/DVD combo. Images are grainy and washed out. Sound is scratchy and subpar. And to top it off, there is a logo in the bottom right corner of every frame of every movie that resembles a cable TV channel logo. Very disappointing."
3,poor quality,"This is a pretty good collection of film noir, but the picture and sound quality and rough editing and splicing of some of the films sucks. Some of the movies are pretty cheesy,such as Too Late for Tears and The Big Bluff, and are a great reflection of how rapidly Hollywood was cranking these out postwar. Others are top notch and will be familiar to film buffs, such as D.O.A., The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, The Hitchhiker, and one of my favorite Edward G. Robinson films, The Stranger. Still others are not as well know, including one of my favorites in this collection, Kansas City Confidential.This collection would be a lot better if the sound and picture quality were improved (esp. the latter) on some of the films. Its a major distraction."
2,Good movies - Bad copies.,These are ten classic film noirs. Unfortunately the video and audio quality of these DVDs is very poor. Get these films in other releases.
3,Good value for the money,"This DVD is an excllent bargain. Lots of classic noir moview for little money. Technical quality of some could be better, but it's a great bargain."
