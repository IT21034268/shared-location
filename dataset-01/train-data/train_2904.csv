4,Works well for making froth for one cup,"I recently received a newKrup'sespresso maker. I don't drink cappuccinos but many of my friends do so I bought astackable cup and saucer setand this item. I use it to make enough foam for one cup of cappuccino and for that I find it to be the right size. I like the quality, weight and heft of it and think that it is a good value. I might get a larger size later (around the holidays) but for what I need right now this one is fine."
4,Does the Trick,"There's not much to this. It does what it is supposed to do. Washes well, and is sturdy. Looks nice. We used it with our espresso/latte machine, and it served its purpose."
5,Happy Joy Joy,"This pitcher is very solid and work very well, especially since I don't need a big pitcher for just making 1 or two lattes.I have only used this once or twice however each time has been good.I have washed it in the dishwasher and so far still okay.Yes I will recommend this to anyone looking for a Frothing pitcher that is suitable for making 1 to 2 lattes etc."
4,A Bit Small,"This frothing pitcher is fine for what it is, but it's just too small for my needs. If you need to steam milk for for a 6oz. latte, this will not cut it. It seems to be well made, and I'll keep it around the kitchen for other uses. I've already placed an order for the 20oz. pitcher."
5,A Must have!,"Excellent piece of equipment to create and complete your sipping pleasure. Delivers the look of a professional barista! Amaze your company, friends and boss."
4,Don't know how it works,"Good product with good quality, but don't know how it works. a little bit small for the home coffee machine"
2,Teeny Tiny,"Yes, I should have paid more attention to the capacity. However, it's not big enough for a single shot let alone a double or triple which is really the norm these days. Cute, sturdy, but really ridiculous to sell one this small."
4,Great little pitcher,This pitcher is perfect for making 2 cappuccinos. I am really satisfied with my purchase.
2,gd product,"altough the quality is fine, the price is not worth the money. I have found the same stainless steel product at the same price but 2 times bigger. Not worth the money. Although the quality is fine, it gets only 2 stars since the price is considerable high.Sorry."
5,Great Book!,"This is a great book!! I was told to get it by my mother-in-law who is great at outdoor gardening and as I am new and she lives far away to be able to ask questions, this book has and will continue to help in knowing what I have that is natural to the area and what else I can add or how to do new stuff."
5,Encyclopedia of Plant Care,"This is, by far, the most comprehensive book of its kind. Should you ever need a gift for a gardner, beginner or expert, this would be a great choice.I have found that to have a picture increases my retention of the name of the plant/bush or tree. All I can say - it's great!"
3,"Concerning The Short Stories of Raffles, Amateur Cracksman","I suppose I should have thought these stories more than simply 'mildly entertaining' had I not been first introduced to G.K Chesterton's ""Father Brown"" series (Father Brown is a 'detective') and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""Sherlock Holmes"" series, both which, for me, far surpass the stories here from E.W. Hornung. Perhaps imagination withstanding, I believe Raffles fell short of the other two in most every category, including style, depth, color, and vividness."
3,A Good Start,"Gosling does particularly well in defining abstract concepts in his field, and the book has some good examples for his model, yet it could have gone a bit deeper. Proof of subjects' personalities agreeing with his teams assessments were not presented in great detail, but the concept itself of what they do is indeed interesting. Greater transparency and clarity in the successful use of their methodologies would have greatly helped the reader, other than a personal reporting of ""what we've been doing lately."" A less general treatment of case studies would have really helped, and the editor definitely should have gone for some photographs and graphics in this project."
5,"Fun, entertaining, and interesting","As a Professional Organizer, I have learned from being in hundreds of homes that I can quickly size up a lot about the person I am working with from their ""stuff."" It helps me do a better job for the client. Reading Dr. Gosling's book was a ""Wow, I always thought that too!"" kind of experience and was a fascinating look into the reasons why I knew what I knew. Great read!"
3,Meh,"The book was alright. Not the most insightful, just an affirmation that stereotypes are usually right."
4,Stuff and Nonsense,"Sam has wasted a fair chunk of his life.Or, perhaps, he has become hooked on snooping around others' living spaces and is now very adept at discerning the basic attributes of his subjects.I will never really understand the driving force which makes a man devote his life to understand others by their personal artifacts, this book is an eye opener. Not having a background in psychology, I do not share the author's reference frameworks and analytical tools, so I am very happy that he has avoided the heavy stuff as he presents the distilled essence of decades of snooping around people's personal spaces, at home, at work and elsewhere.This is a pleasant and informative book, an introduction to a completely different way to view our environment and that of our friends and acquaintances. I am glad that I own this book - I will surely come back again and re-read it. It will stay on my shelves, which no library book can do. This is a book to own and to keep."
4,entertaining,"approachable social science with a dose of humor. engaging work that brings you to the forefront. you find yourself thinking and participating in the ideas that Gosling puts forth. 'snoop' is an unfortunate title but at the very least, you'll look good reading it (nice color on the cover)."
1,Misleading,A horrible misrepresentation. So boring & not at all what I thought it to be. Don't waste your time. It was like reading homework.
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing on two levels. Feels as if it was an attempt to write an academic text that was twisted to try to make a ""popular"" work and ends up being neither. While there certainly are a smattering of momentarily interesting facts scattered through the book, more often it seems full of the obvious. Not really worth the time."
2,Very Little Substance,"The book has very little substance, it is rather like an essay or research paper that has been expanded with the aim of making it commercially viable. All the conclusions are just common sense, you don't need a PHD to figure out that if someone has a skateboard, a surfboard and a snowboard stacked against the wall of their room then they must be an extreme sports advocate (and if the skateboard, surfboard and snowboard look like new then they are a wannabe extreme sports advocate). The author meanders from one area to the next, never quite satisfying the reader, and ultimatly frustrating him or her. I do not think this book worth the time or the money, and it will not hold most people's attention longer than halfway through."
3,HMMM...,"Ever walk into another persons home/apartment and think, ""What the Hell?"", this book kinda...sorta helps you sort out quicker the psychology/mind set of the home owner/renter, therefore providing you with an excuse to get the heck out of there."
2,Snoop,"I won't waste your time with a lengthy review. Simply, I found the author's writing tedious and the structure of his research somewhat questionable. I finally started scanning ahead, hoping to find new ideas or something remotely interesting. I found neither. Read a basic psychology book; it would be more interesting."
3,Misadvertised... but not bad,"Most of ""Snoop"" could serve as a personality psychology primer as the author spends extensive amounts of time explaining basic aspects of his field. His discussion of methodology and literature review (that is, what he did it and research other people have done) is long and detailed. But the results are few and far in between and padded with caveats. If you were looking to find out what your blue lampshade or quirky lawn flamingo wallpaper says about you, this book will either give you no answers or at least, not tell you anything you didn't already know. Thus, it isn't a 'bad' book as much as the product of erroneous marketing. Gosling's research would have made a splendid article for a magazine like ""The New Yorker"" but as a book, it feels stretched out..."
3,This book was unfocused,"Snoop was a bit unfocused. I read the book because I thought it would be about how to evaluate settings and determine how setting relates to personality. What I found was a bit of original research - mostly about college students' rooms - and a long literature review about personality. I would have preferred a book that discussed the original research more extensively. I would have preferred stories about how they gained access to people, rooms, environments and what was actually discovered in greater depth. I could have done without the general review of personality in the academic literature."
2,Largely Disappointing,Unfortunately I found this book is be largely repetitive since most of the conclusions became obvious after the first few chapters. It smacked of a research paper padded out to book form.
3,Great title but lacks content,"I was looking forward to when he woudl actually get to a point in this book. Author seems to dance around the subject and rather than actually talking about how to read possessions and case studies of such work, he more tells about things to look for and not to look for without drawing any meaningful conclusions. Therefore, in the end the book becomes boring."
3,Slim Pickings,"This is one of those cases where once you hear something, it seems so obvious that you feel like you already knew it. And probably you did. Author Sam Gosling makes a point of telling us that some of our intuitions are incorrect, and that what he's saying isn't all self-evident. But the take-away here just seems pretty thin. He describes various ways of categorizing personality types, and uses a very basic 5-trait personality description for the basis of most of what he says. I expected more of a marketing perspective, but all the action here takes place in dorm rooms, where we find out whether tidy is the same as tidied, and that your taste in music tells pretty much everything a possible mate would want to know about you."
3,Well written but of dubious scientific validity,"This is an enjoyable book, mainly about stage hypnotism. It is short on science and maintains the old idea that animal magnetism is at the basis of hypnosis. This theory was scienfically discreditated at the time of Anton Mesmer and Ben Franklin. The practical points are well done, but the theory is consists of New Age claptrap and pseudoscience. If you want to learn to be a stage hypnotist and don't care about understanding the science behind hypnosis, this is a good book to buy (though it is rather expensive for such a brief volume). The practical ""how-to"" advice is sound. If you are more skeptical and value the findings of modern science, you will be disappointed since this book promulgates unscientific misinformation and long-discredited theories about hypnotic influence."
5,The how to book of Hypnotism.,"I AM TRULY IMPRESSED BY THE ""HOW TO BOOK OF HYPNOTISM"" BY TOM SILVER AND ORMOND MC GILL. THESE 2 SEASONED MASTERS OF HYPNOTISM HAVE JOINED FORCES TO PRESENT A BOOK THAT IS NOTHING SHORT OF THE HOLY GRAIL OF HOW TO BOOKS.THIS BOOK NOT ONLY TEACHES HYPNOSIS BUT ALL FACETS OF THE ART AND EVEN BEYOND THAT: STAGE HYPNOTISM, HYPNOTHERAPY, SELF HYPNOTISM, POSITIVE MOTIVATION TECHNIQUES EVEN UP TO THE CONCEPTS OF MYSTICAL TEACHINGS AND ENLIGHTENMENT! THIS BOOK ISN'T JUST FOR THE STUDENT OR THE PROFESSIONAL, IT'S FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES. IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR ANY PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENTS AND INSTITUTES OF HYPNOSIS.THE BOOK IS ONLY 169 PAGES BUT OTHER BOOKS NO MATTER HOW BIG THEY ARE DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO THIS ONE. BRIAN WISHNEFSKY HYPNOTIST."
4,Good start into the study of hypnotism,"This is a great book for lay people who find themselves interested in hypnotism. It covers basic history and theory, and gives practical advice on how to hypnotize people for entertainment. Many of the exercises are amusing and do actually work when tried. The latter part of the book does make some seemingly outrageous claims regarding the healing power of hypnotism without any real evidence, and the last chapter has significant typographical and grammar errors, but overall if you are looking for an intro into hypnotism, this is a good place to start."
2,Not for the serious student,"This book is principally aimed at the showman (or showwoman), not at the serious hypnotist. The extremely directive and controlling techniques for induction are not only outdated, they are improper if working in a therapeutic setting. They are, above all, not aimed at developing trust between the hypnotist and the client. On the other hand, if you simply want to do parlor tricks or night-club shows, then this is your book."
5,Both Professionals and Novices will treasure it!,"This was the first book I purchased on the subject of hypnotism. It gave me the history, the wonderful possibilities and the benefits of hypnosis. The book is clear and powerful.Now that I am a certified hypnotherapist, I continually go back to this book for reference, inspiration, and ways to improve my practice.The book is fantastic, but it's also up to you to practice the many inductions. Creativity and Confidence are key elements to being a success in this field, and this book gave me all the tools."
1,Did the makers of this toy actually try it?,"This thing is a piece of junk! Granted, it only costs $30, so the quality of the camera is about what I expected, but the truly poor aspect of this toy, and the reason I've returned it, is the software. Downloading images/video from the camera takes quite awhile. It occasionally doesn't recognize the camera so you have to unplug/plug in the USB cable again (this actually might be a WindowsXP problem??). It names the files for you for install to the hard drive so you have to create a new directory each time, all with arcane names like photo001..., in them, so it doesn't save them over your old files. This quickly becomes unmanageable for a little girl. There were bugs when inserting the pictures in the journal. I'd drag the thumbnail of one picture over, but a different one would appear. The website has no information for bug fix downloads and no apparent e-mail for help."
3,"Lousy Camera, OK Software.",my daughter was happy at first few days after receiving this as a gift. But she stopped using it citing the low quality photos and videos the camera take. Also the memory is too small - just 8 photos then it is full.
1,Not worth the price,"Very poor quality product - both the hardware and software. The hardware feels very flimsy, especially when you get a Flip camcorder for a similar price. The software was absolutely terrible and in fact did not work for us at all (we have Windows 7). Our daughter was very disappointed, and the worst part is that since we opened up the package, the seller (which is not Amazon) will not even take it back."
3,Fun but...,"I bought this for my 13 year old niece. It's really entertaining, but the software is a little iffy. It may be user error though! Overall, it's ok."
1,Big disappointment,"This was an xmas gift for my daughter. I was so excited about giving it to her and thought it would be fun for her to take pictures and make videos. I understood they wouldn't have sound and would be short. However, the software kept crashing so nothing could get uploaded to the computer unless I tried doing it through windows movie maker, a process which just frustrated my 10-year-old. The software is suppose to make it more user/kid friendly, without that it's not much use. I'll spend the 100 dollars and get a flip cam instead, then she can have 60 mins of vid time, sound, and the thing will function properly. Sometimes you have to pay more to get quality and this certainly is the case."
1,Junk,It's junk..don't waste your money. I read the good reviews and bought this last year for my daughter and it was a total waste of money. It does not take even decent pictures. I knew it wouldn't take good quality pictures but I expected more then the very low grainy pictures that it did take.
5,This product is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My mom bought me the video journal for christmas.I am 12 years old and I loved it.I just bring my camara anywhere when i see something cool i just take picture and write what i found cool about it.I am sure I am never getting bored with my video journal.
4,Great TV Stand... but limited room for other components,"We purchased this stand because we didn't want to mount our new TV on a wall. This stand looks very nice and was relatively easy to put together. It came with bags of hardware to enable mounting to almost any TV. The only downside for us was we have the stereo, TiVo, DVD player, etc... all tied into this TV so you may have to get creative on where to stack them all. Another upside was that many of the cords can be run up the back of the post so you don't see a bunch of loose wires in behind the unit. We are very happy with our setup."
4,Great Stand,"The stand was slightly bigger than I expected but it is very good quality. Because of the size of the stand, I wouldn't recommend putting anything smaller than a 40"" TV on it (even though it accomodates down to a 32""). A smaller TV looks really small on the stand because of its size. It is a great alternative to mounting a TV on the wall."
4,Just what I wanted,"I wanted a TV stand that would put my 32"" Vizio TV up high so that when I lay in bed I don't have to prop my head up very much. It works just like I thought and the product is very sturdy and easy to install. I did it myself without any help."
4,The base is not flat!,"This is an extremely impressive build as far as sturdiness goes, the box is almost 100lbs. for a reason, the base is well made as well as the pole which is about 5 inches wide.My only issue is the base itself. I had no idea it would be over an 1inch thick due to the reinforcements.Other than that, this is a very well engineered piece with straight forward and simple instructions.Caution: the M and L screws are almost exactly the same except for the length!! The M is for the shelf, and also even though there are 6 holes for the tv mount base - only use 4 (top and bottom 2)! Don't undo the entire set up like I did to remove the two screws!"
1,Product Review,The product did not work properly. When the faucet was installed the water gushed out all over the place. The product was returned for refund over two weeks ago. We still have not heard from anyone on the refund.
3,What a let down...................,"The first half of this book was interesting. The second half was good, but it seemed they wrapped the whole book up in the last chapter and it left you craving for more info. What happened????????????? Also, there were booking photos of some women who were only breifly mentioned in the book and it never expanded on why in the world they were booked for anything. I felt excited at first, but just let down at the end."
4,good crime backgrounder,Being from Houston where this crime took place I liked the behind the scenes info on TV cameraman John Treadgold and the first police officers reaction to being first on the scene of this tragedy. The background into the families life was very detailed. Some reviewers question the book not covering the trial: but it was mainly a P.S. to the actual act anyway.
4,tradegy/need not have happened////////by donna hunnicutt,"she asked for help. she got none. the switching of drugs left and right; all those babies to care for. that jewel of a hubby should be in prison himself; he was interested in making babies, not taking care of them. i would have liked to have known before reading this, who was on her side? no one. homeschooling,cooking,changing diapers, childbirth after childbirth-too soon. i would have gone completely insane long before she did. so awfully sad and i think her whole family deserves some blame for it."
4,Breaking Point. Paper Back,"I found the book to be more of a defence for Andrea Yates than a true account of events. The auther gave a reason for everything Andrea did. I think a sick act like that should be unexplained and swift harsh punishment should be delt. I don't want to understand why, I just want justice for the kids. With that said it was interesting and well written."
1,Ingredients not disclosed,"I was unable to use this product and had to give it to a friend, since like many Amazon-advertised hair care products, ingredients were not listed, and so one is gambling that an undesired ingredient won't be in the product. Alas, this conditioner contains both menthol and mint, and since my scalp is not a cigarette and doesn't need to be mentholated, nor is it in need of an after-dinner sweet, this product didn't work for me. When will Amazon provide this information, so that we're not wasting $10-20 on products such as this?"
4,JR watkins salve,"Good for those liking a nice, old school salve. My husband gets very dry, cracked skin especially on his hands in the winter and claims this is one of the best things for it. Cover areas after applying it, though, as it can be greasy."
5,Wonderful!,I bought this after a friend gave me some for an oil burn before I could get to the doctor. The doctor was even impressed with how soothing it was. I will always have some in my house!
5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST STUFF....EVER!,"I thought I would never find this product again. My lips had been burning due to some facial moisturizer that I was using and it began to sting my lips and I purchased this and it stopped the pain instantly! This is also great for pimples, itchy acne, burns and it last forever! It literally does not get old my granny has an old tin of this stuff from 1960's and I swear its not gone bad. But anyway this is the best product ever."
3,Watkins Petro-Carbo Salve,"looking for a replacement for Medicated vasoline, which is no longer made, and it does not replace it and costs a lot more."
2,Petro-Carbo Salve,"Petro-Carbo Salve, well the name ought to tell you something...it's nothing but carbolated vaseline. If you want some, go down to Walgreen's and by a jar, a lot cheaper that this stuff. Works the same and it costs less."
5,Watkins Salve,This is the best stuff. I use it on everything.... have had this product since i was a kid.. my grandmother used it.
3,Not the best Hugh B. Cave Anthology,"I believe Hugh B. Cave was one of the all-time greatest of the pulp writers, but Long Live The Dead, which reprints all of his mystery/detective tales from Black Mask magazine, was not his best work. The stories are okay but nothing special, certainly nothing memorable. Worse, whoever edited this book needs to have their head examined! There are a ton of embarrassing typos and formatting errors riddled throughout the entire book. Perhaps these are holdovers from the original pulps that nobody bothered to correct, but I find their inclusion rather unforgivable, particularly in what is supposed to be a book meant to honor and celebrate the author on his 90th birthday.Instead of Long Live The Dead, I would recommend you buy these Hugh B. Cave reprint anthologies (in order of awesomeness):Murgunstrumm & Others,Death Stalks the NightandThe Door Below."
5,Starting Point Bible,I was really impressed and excited about this Bible. I wanted another Bible to further enhance my studies and this was it.Easy to use and has lots of extras. Just what I was looking for.
3,Not that great,"This DVD has some funny moments both recent and classic. Some great stuff with Bobby Heenan and Gorilla Monsoon. A lot of stuff that has been on Raw and Smackdown in the pat couple of years. If you've been a regular viewer, there may not be a lot of stuff you haven't. There are also some bloopers like Rock loosing his voice trying to do a live promo, and another where he drops his sunglasses while taking them off.Also there are no chapters or main menu to this DVD. It autoplays when you insert it and plays a continuous loop. And because of the rating, there is a lot of censoring(ie. Shawn and HHH's Xmas strip show, DX in New York)All in all, not a bad DVD, but at the same time not a great one either.There's"
3,Not bad......not great,"Not a bad DVD. Shows some real funny stuff from over the years. Goes as far back to the 1980's up to real current stuff from not to long ago this year. Would have been nice if they let some of the entire skits play out, but they have a ton of clips and you will laugh a lot."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this dvd and knew the problems with the dvd. Yes, there is no menu and no chapter selection. If you must buy this (which is not worth it), buy a VHS copy instead. Here is some stupid stuffBushwhackers are eating like pigs in different areas of the dvd, totaling maybe five minutes. Why?Bossman killing Al Snow's dog and feeding it to him? Are you friggin kidding me? Who is sitting back and laughing about that? Its disguisting.Mideon screwing a turkey? wow, i'm rolling over with laughter.The funniest moments can be seen on other dvds but a few are not. I would not recommend buying this dvd at all. Waste of time and money."
3,It's OK,"As much as I LUV wrestling, I hafta say this could have been a little bit more. Most of it is still pretty funny, but some isn't. The Rock was great in it, but other then that, there were just times like food fights, or when Vince McMahon was in the hospital and got attacked by Austin."
4,a longtime fan's review,THIS WAS A FUNNY VIDEO BUT IN MY OPINION I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED MORE FUNNIER MOMENTS.
1,Fecal Matter aka CRAP!!,"This has to be the worst documentary I've ever seen. The rock music with the animation was like watching a cartoon. And the so-called ""hunters"" were laughable. Every time they experienced something the camera was always pointed at them instead of what they were supposedly seeing. Then they make all kinds of assumptions with no facts to back them up. The one star I gave this documentary goes to the witnesses they seemed crediable and honest about what they experienced. I've studied books and seen just about every video and movie ever made about Bigfoot and this type of documentary is what damages and destroys peoples belief in Bigfoot and any real evidence and credibility of it's exsistance."
5,A MUST READ especially for the hard core addict or parent,"This book is unlike anything else written for the hard core user. The author talks straight to the deepest, darkest reasons/excuses for remaining a drug user. Divided into chapters by the user's excuse for continued use. A very logical approach that shoots holes in every possible reason for not quitting. It also helps the parent of a user relate to why their loved one is so lost in the addiction bliss. It is easy to read, straight (even blunt) talking and uses real world examples. I highly recommend it to anyone having trouble kicking the habit or anyone who loves someone like that. A very refreshing approach to drug/alcohol counseling. As the book references, the physical substances passes through the body very quickly, so obviously the remaining addictions are mental...not physical.Worth every penny and then some!"
4,Loved it,I'm working my way though all the Harry Bosch books and loving the journey. Can't wait for the next one
1,horriable,yes i ordered a front rotor for my 2000 chrysler concord lxi and was sent a rear rotor so i wasted my money i will never order from this place again
2,Misnamed,"Supposedly a brief econium on grief, Holleran's book actually turns out to be an overlong rumination on loneliness and age. It's poorly glued together with snippets from the letters of Mary Todd Lincoln that are only distinctive by how poorly they meld with the narrator's own life. Overall, it's wildly uneven, an idea that should have been delivered as a straight more formal essay, but is instead shoe horned into an uncomfortable novelistic format. Characters seem to drop in and out to deliver their own ideas on loss, but never do the conversations seem to have arisen naturally. What Holleran is really writing about is loneliness resulting from age and the lack of love. Had he managed to insist that this is a universal theme, rather than claim it for his tiny world of [...] Washington, it could have been a touching book. As is, it's just a minor disappointment."
5,Deceptively simple; simply brilliant,"Stunning, sad, beautiful. It poured liquid nitrogen onto my heart and then shattered it with the slightest tap."
4,Even the best prose needs an editor!,"A fine, warm, novella that will remain evocative of a particular time for many years. As other reviewers have pointed out, the use of local color is extensive and appropriate, but it should have been reivewed. At one point, the narrator goes to a Sunday evening concert at the National Gallery and enters through the great bronze doors on Massachusetts Ave.--only they're on Constitution. There is no entrance to the Natl. Gallery from Mass. Ave. The main entrance to the National Gallery of Art is not an obscure local reference and it should have been caught. It's not the end of the world, but it makes the knowledgeable reader stumble and leave the narrative flow."
3,Life isn't always pretty,"Mr. Hollerans overwhelming negativity sucks the life out of me, but his books are captivating in that they are so well written. I could only give three stars though."
3,"Mourning, Afternoon, and Evening","This book moved me. With the exception of the dog, I wanted to bitch-slap each character and say ""Honey, get over yourself!""This book is an eloquent, intimate portrayal of never ending narcissism. The main character is, I think, ""Fred Lemish,"" (from Larry Kramer's ""Faggots"") thirty years later. Viruses and advancing age, some might contend they're the same, have conspired to suck joy from the core of the character's soul.I'm an aging gay man. I hope to never resemble any character from this book-not even the dog."
2,Uneven,"I found ""Grief"" to be engaging and fairly well-written, but the quality of the writing is uneven: while much is lovely and rings true, the dialogue is often stilted, and the insights into grieving often seem worn and elementary. I wish the author had been able to get some insight into the protagonist's isolation, since the conclusion is resignation to self-created bleakness."
1,Disappointment,"After hearing the NPR review of this book I raced out to buy it. How disappointed I was when I read it. Although easy to read (Mr. Holleran has a lovely style) it was essentually empty of emotion. I felt nothing. I wanted to say to all of the primary characters ""Get over yourself"". All of the main participants were beautiful, clever, intelligent. Well, fine. Just come to grips with your lives. Stop whining."
1,Disappointed because of recommendations from Balogh & Putney,"Like other books by this author, it took over 100 pages for me to even become interested in these characters. Slow, slow descriptions about minute details did not add to the book for me and they just made the story drag on and on. The love story between the hero and heroine was confusing, one minute the hero was lying to her, the next minute he was supposedly telling the heroine the truth, I couldn't tell why they even cared about each other. I never even bothered with the last 60 pages because I don't even care if these two strange characters end up together. This story left me feeling extremely dissatisfied and disappointed because it could have been so much better than it was. I will avoid this author in the future and wonder why Mary Balogh (my favorite author of romance) and Mary Jo Putney (no slouch herself) thought so highly of this book."
3,Readable,"Invented countries which feel invented ( an invented language named glarisch?), characters which are suitably omniscient and insuitably modern, plot turns without reasons. Characters whose actions don't quite match their supposed personalities. Readable, but I was expecting more. I liked her books as JRE better."
2,Can't finish it,"I've tried, but I just can't keep reading this book. The heroine is such a whining ninny. What could anyone possibly see in her? Horses and dogs figure prominently in the story, which I normally love, but they aren't enough to make me push on. (would have rated 1 star, but anything full of dogs and horses gets another star). Since I don't care how it ends, I'm going to read something else. Wish I hadn't wasted my money."
1,Purple Prose and the Fairy Prince,"This is absolutely the worst book I've ever read...ever! Publishers and editors should use it as a standard of everything that is wrong with a book to share with would-be authors. There is very little actual dialogue between the characters, there is no plot, the characters are utterly repulsive. Why didn't I listen to the reviewer who said this book never gets better! I bought in to Mary Balogh's ""in awe"" review. Don't believe it. Ms. Ross' overuse of prose is horrible! I want to save others from being a victim of this publishing crime!"
4,An excellent science fiction story.,"I really enjoyed reading this series. Someday I hope I can get my hands on a copy of the first book, The Ivory Gate.This is a story about a girl named Theodora who is marooned on a world with both magic and technology. She discovers that she has certain powers which make her very valuable to those around her.This series has romance, adventure, and excitement. It's fun to see how Theodora changes from the first book to the last book. I definitely recommend this book"
3,Good versus Evil in the old West,"King of the Pecos was probably part of the double bill at the Bijou's Saturday matinee. If you buy it, you'll watch it once.It isn't awful, but it's nothing special, either."
4,Cleburn's Revenge,"John Cleburn and his family were hard working settlers with legal right to prime western property. They happened to be on the property that the thieving Alexander Stiles set his sights upon. When Cleburn did not agree to sell his property, Stiles and his evil cronies just killed Cleburn and his wife and beat their son, leaving him for dead. But, he did not die, and you can imagine that John Jr. grew up with revenge in his eyes. He became a lawyer and a gunman. With those two talents, he eventually manages to ruin the evil Stiles Empire. John Wayne was the only one in the film with much acting ability. His two sidekicks are somewhat funny. As usual, there is a wedding at the end and JW is in it. This is a good film for all to see. Get your kids into the old Wayne films. They are clean and wholesome good fun."
4,King of the Pecos,I am a John Wayne fan with over 70 of his movies. I agree with the other reviews of the plot of the movie. It is top of the line of John Wayne's grade B Republic movies. The DVD has been fixed & the sound & picture are better than I expected. I especially enjoyed the ending since I am slightly hard of hearing.
4,good basic switch,Fast switch but runs very hot. Also lacks support for IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP).Price is reasonable.
1,"With dishonesty, all is possible","Dehoff's wondrous glossing over of obvious biblical contradictions doesn't even amuse. This is old stuff; nothing new here at all. The plain and simple fact is that the bible is an inconsistent, patched together work. I would suggest that Dehoff would instead spend his time better by simply admitting the truth, and then justifying why the bible is such an inconsistent, inaccurate document."
5,helpful,"new mom here, living in brooklyn and going to tribeca ped. i got dr. sears' ""the baby book"", i got the enzo's ""babywise"" (these seem to be on opposite ends of the parenting philosophy spectrum) and i got this one. this seems to strike a good balance and has sensible suggestions for sleep training, food training and discipline.the alphabetical organization is a little unusual, and i wish there were a better way to separate the parenting philosophy-type sections--ie: ""breastfeeding"" ""napping"" ""colic"" ""discipline""-- from the more straight medical sections, like ""pinworms"". don't agree with everything he says but all babies are different and with trial and error you will find what works for you.note that it appears that all of the content is available for free online at thenewbasics.com, arranged alphabetically like in the book (click on ""book excerpts"" at the bottom)."
3,Not as happy as I thought I would be.,"The fact that his views are better than everyone else's is clear throughout this book. Some advice is very useful I think, but not at all understanding to different parenting choices and styles. Covers breastfeeding and formula feeding but says that ""if you've already given it [breastfeeding] a good try and disliked it (or if you don't even want to try), your baby still stands a very good chance of being healthy."" Comments like these are too judgmental and not at all helpful. Of course, if you are of this same mind, then it's the perfect book for you!"
1,Just a dictionary,"I'm not quite sure of the purpose of this book. Most of the entries are a paragraph long and simply define the word. For example, under Flu it tells you all about what the flu is but nothing about what to do for your baby. Huh? Even the developmental milestones are a paragraph for each 3 months span of age which hardly tells you much. On a side note I find calling all little boys Jimmy and little girls Lucy annoying and WASPy. I looked through this book, now I'm returning it."
4,"Fun, fast, empowering","My sister's lamaze girlfriends gave her this book this past weekend, and with just three weeks to go till D-Day, she's memorized all the main points and is feeling ready to take it all on. I looked through it and liked how direct it is. I'm getting one for my neighbor.Sis loved the book because it was fun to read and it covered all the important stuff. She also claims it's the only baby book her boyfriend will read.I have to say that the part about ear infectiosn is right on! Our boys suffered from those, and the one time we didn't use antibiotics, they cleared up faster and stayed clear longer. We never looked back.I'm not crazy about the silly names Cohen gives his imaginary patients, but at least he's consistent. Overall, it's a great way for parents to stay on top of all the issues. One question: where's the sequel? I could use it about now!"
1,Useless!!,"The doctor is only interested in sounding ""cool""...I definitely prefer the other doctors in his office - anyone but him!!"
1,Tragically uninformed,"Dr. Michel Cohen's laid back, ""less is more"" style has led to at least one case of undiagnosed, stage 4 cancer in a 3-year old patient of his here in New York. For this child's distended belly and painful bowel movements he prescribed prunes and enemas. A second opinion and a simple blood test told the truth. Tragically, this doctor is all flash and no substance, and the same could be said for his book."
2,Missing pages 1-19,"I haven't read the book for content yet, but was disappointed to find that my copy is missing the entire letter ""a"" section -- it starts on page 20 with letter ""b"". Not sure it's worth repackaging and schlepping to the post office to ship it back to Amazon for $10, and I'm afraid to order another copy lest it have the same issue."
1,More ego than information,"I read through the breastfeeding sections of this book last night and thank goodness I did so that I didn't waste my time and money on the whole book.This man has an obvious personal agenda. It is woefully apparent throughout the entire section on nursing. He gives such horrible advice, it makes me angry. I have visited his own website and sent him a letter about it. I really hope others do the same.Mothers have enough on their plate without more of this 70s-style push away from nursing. The last thing they need is to be misinformed. I belong to more than a few mothering circles and you can bet I will be warning my friends about this guy."
1,The wrong color,"Once again Amazon dissapointed me. They sent me the right product, but in a different color. In the product description it shows a picture of a pink diaper bag, instead I got the color brown. I tried to write back to them and tell them they gave me the wrong color, but they never responded. Not sure I wanna order from them again."
1,Wont work,"It seems like it would work fine, but i can't connect my DS lite to connect to this thing. Signal is green for a couple seconds then the signal drops."
2,not working,"I followed the installation prompts and switched it to AP mode, and I've got the pretty blue light lit up, but my wii still says ""unable to connect to server."" Am extremely open to suggestions."
1,Did not work,"I could not get this to work, and my husband works with computers all day and he could not get it to work. My son was very disappointed. I would not recommend this product."
3,Hard to set up,"As many people have said, this thing works great once it's configured. It's configuring it that's hard. Terrible support from the company. It took me hours to get it working with my Nintendo DS. When I turned the adapter into Access Point mode I would lose my internet connection all together. After a few tries I finally got it working. The DS prefers, or maybe requires, a transmission rate of 1-2 mbps."
1,Doesn't work...,"I've tried ap mode as suggested, but i haven't gotten it to work for my ipod touch, dsi, or psp. Apparently something is wrong with the ip address any tips would be greatly appreciated. I've even tried using different hot spots that i know work, HELP ME!"
1,Do Not Buy At All,I purchased this device to connect my NDS to my network. I've tried all of the advice I've read in the customer comments and was still unable to connect. I used it on a Windows 7 PC and on a Snow Leopard Mac. I've downloaded the various drivers from the company website and it still won't work to connect. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Lead Content,"I checked this dood out and it has a lot of lead in it, check the prev reviews, comes from china with lots of heavy metal. Would buy again, thats what my friend Iron Man said, he wants some new Lead Boots."
4,"Tricky to set up, but works fine","I bought this for use with my new Nintendo DSi, primarily based on other reviews here and the low price. As others have said, the documentation that comes with it is nearly useless, and I used the tips they provided to switch to AP mode. However, I could not get my DSi to connect until I went to the Planex website and downloaded the latest driver. Now it works fine and I am quite happy with it."
2,Works great... but close to impossible to set up...,"I bought this a week ago and I tried this today...Wow... I have no idea what to do... I did what the manual saysand it doean't work... Plus, I can't find anything Online...So if anyone found ""set up instruction"", please E-mail me....""sting7969@hotmail.com"" Help me!!"
1,Does not work,"This product simply will not work for me. I've tried virtually every fix listed in the other reviews, but I still cannot get my Nintendo 3DS or Nintendo DS Lite to connect to the access point. Some people have managed to get this product working after screwing around with it for a while but I am not one of those people. I would not recommend it at all."
2,Any tips?,"I know it's probably just a trick to getting it working, but any ideas on how to get it working in Windows 7?I install it and switch it to AP mode, but the utility seems very pared down compared to other screen shots I've seen in various places on the web. I try connecting my DSlite to it and I keep getting ""Access point is busy""anyone have links for me or anything? any help would be appreciated"
3,Not what I expected,"I love Dominick Dunne s work . He is an excellent writter and extremely knowledgeable about his subjects. It was a great book ,I would have preferred a more in-depth information."
3,Fairly interesting,Repetitive stories culled from already read parts of previous stories in this collection. Good but not great. Like gossip at lunch.
1,boring,Sorry I just could not get into this book. The writing was not worth the time and effort. I couldn't finish it
5,Love Domnick....,"LOve this book, I thought I had read this book before but bought it anyway, HOWEVER never read before and its awesome as all his books are."
3,Not his best work...,"Dunne is a fantastic and fun writer. This collection gets bogged down however. Many of the stories are dated and the updates are not recent. Many of the stories are reprinted in the far superior colleciton, Justice. Still, parts of this book, particularly the Gloria Vanderbilt story, stand out. If you like Dunne, I would start with Justice and move backwards. It is fun to read many of his stories do have something of a timeless quality. I was frustrated with parts of book which seemed dated and dull. Ahh..what do I know. Dunne is still great."
3,Not my favorite Dominick Dunne...,"I Love Dominick Dunne's book, but this one was a bit boring. I liked reading about the Menendez brothers case, OJ's case and a few other recent cases. The rest of the chapters were about older, unknown, irrelevant socialites that did not interest me. Very slow read and I skipped many chapters rather than read them. Would not buy again..."
3,Till his race was run: Dominick Dunne,"Fans of the late Dominick Dunne will already be familiar with these tales, and the book is not substantial enough to become a ""keeper"" in one's library. If, however, you are NOT already familiar with Dominick's work (or saw him on TV but never read his prose), here is a good place to start.To this reviewer, the value of FATAL CHARMS lies in its being a sampler of excellent personality-profile journalism. That, dear reader, is easier said than accomplished. Of course, let us not forget that Dominick Dunne emerged as a writer from the fiery furnace of tragedy (murdered daughter), and also that he had access to the rich and famous, most of whom liked and trusted him. Good place to have started a new career late in life. He took that opportunity and ran with it until his race was run."
3,It's ok enough.....,"I have bought another pair of OR pants previously and the fit was great for that pair.With this pair of OR Venture Pants, the XS is bigger than the previous pair, especially at the waist!The length is still alright despite the overall loose fit. I would personally prefer a slightly narrower fit.The material is great and water drops just rolled off when I was walking in the rain. This is the one feature that I liked of this pants.I had thought of returning it but because it's often not easy for me to find a good pair of pants that's reasonably priced and fits well, I'd decided to just stick with it. After all, it's just another pair of pants that I'll be using in the outdoors when roughing it out."
2,Weak contender,"Steer clear from the FRV series from SONY. Sony makes great products but this is not the one. Go with the GRT series for any multimedia graphics needs. I owned this laptop for 12 days and had numerous issues including the DVD-R was DOA. Pinnacle studio 8 crashed every time. Benchamrk scores compared this 2.8 p4 to 1.8 p4's .... not good. On a positive note the LCD is beautifull, great keyboard and design, Nice Sony software package. This is not a desktop replacement though. And with the inability to do any multimedia with the limited IGP, it renders the DVD-R useless anyway."
3,"Big, heavy, short battery life","I bought this laptop 7 months ago, as a desktop replacement, and I quite like it. But I'm not sure why - it weighs a ton, the battery now lasts less than half an hour, and the DVD burner has a DVD-to-coaster making ratio of less than 50%.But on the plus side it's powerful (I use it for video editing), and the screen and keyboard are both good, and overall it's not bad value, especially if you're lucky enough to get a reliable DVD burner."
2,Recovery Issues,I had a lot of trouble upgrading from XP Home that came bundled with my FRV37 to XP Professional. I had to do a fresh installation of XP Pro that formatted my machine. This also resulted in loosing all of the preloaded software. I just ordered for a set of Recovery DVD's from sony for $35. I fail to understand why Sony wants to save on recovery CDs...Customers beware!!! Do not try updrading the machine to XP Professional. Sony does not support it.
1,GREAT LAPTOP PITY THE BURNER DOESN'T WORK,I rate this laptop highly in all areas except the DVD-RW drive has never worked. I have tried everything including contacting Sony support and nothing works. This problem seems to be a widely known issue with no answer.I would definitely buy another product with another burner in it if you are interested in burning or backing up data to a DVD.
2,DVD-R not works,"Well, I recently bought the FRV-37 Notebook. It's nice when you want speed, space of hard drive..but when i want to burn DVD's it have a constant WRITE ERROR... I'm from Chile and i dont have garanty here because i bought in USA on my vacation... That's the only wrong thing about this computer... But it's too importante because it's the more expensive part of this laptop..If you know how to repair it please write me at : juanpa_10@hotmail.comThanks a Lot"
2,Hard Drive Failed After 14 days.,"Bought the computer on my trip to Honolulu Hawaii on Oct. 21. On a business trip to Japan, the hard drive failed and could not get it fixed at Sony Dealers in Japan. Was told that must send to San Diego, CA to get fixed. Recent quotation is $700 plus. Never buy Sony made in China. Will never buy Sony...period."
1,"Bad Hardisk, bad keyboard, bad battery","I bought this laptop about 2 years. But after 2 years my dardisk, keyboard and battery was damaged. I ask the support but dont have anything. Very very :-(((((("
3,Beautiful Scenery,"I like tales about Scotland, so this was an interesting story about the Hebrides. The whirlpool scenes were exciting! Although the story was a bit predictable, it was still fun."
2,I Know Where I'm Going,I was totally underwhelmed by this movie. I thought the plot was contrived and silly. Wendy Hiller may have been a great stage actress but she doesn't translate well to the big screen. Roger Livesey was enjoyable but equally transparent.I find it hard to believe that a purported intelligent woman who is a gold digger with a father fantasy would think it was a reasonable to get on a rickety boat in the middle of a horrendous storm and risk her death and the deaths of others so that she could resist her attraction to a poor man (Livesey) in order to marry the rich old guy on an island on the other side of the storm.The boat scenes are ludicrous and the movie was an over-acted waste of celluloid.
1,A tough read; lacking in insight,"I found this book difficult to read. The problem for this reader was that familiar material was presented in an overly repetitive way with few new insights, while the material that was new to me was difficult to even comprehend. This is certainly not one of the books I would recommend for someone interested in learning more about Hamlet.For example, the first chapter discusses the way that Shakespeare added characters to his source materials to enhance the effect of the play. Welsh focuses on the expansion of Polonius' family to provide a foil to Hamlet's family. This information could have been presented much more crisply, and is familiar to any one who has read even the briefest discussions of Shakespeare's source material, for example Jenkin's introduction to the Arden version of Hamlet. On the other hand, on reading the chapter Welsh wrote on Goethe and Scott's comments on Hamlet, I never could follow which of these two critics he was talking about. Not fun."
5,An excellent sourcebook on running Inquisition chronicles,"This book is full of information that gives mortals an upper hand in the World Of Darkness. It details the history of the Inquisition and its role in the modern World Of Darkness, and how the Society of Leopold views the supernatural beings they hunt. The rules for the torture of vampires and other supernatural is enough to make any good Storyteller weave in a moral and ethical lesson into the chronicle, and the amount of suspense that can be created by the misinformation that the Society has about other supernaturals all make for a darn good suspense filled chronicle..and a painful learning lesson for the Society. All in all, a great addition if you want to play a flesh and blood mortal who's tired of being pushed around by monsters."
2,Kinda Dull,"I wasn't really sure what it was I was hoping this book to be, but it was most certainly a disappointment.We get a history of the Inquisition, and what they are are doing in modern times, (Okay the 90's but it was modern times back then!) and how much they know about the various supernatural groups in the World of Darkness. We do get a little more specific and we learn about the different sub-groups in the Inquisition, but it's only enough to wet our appetite and make us want more, which the book fails to deliver the follow up to.The story ideas that this book can give are pretty good, but let's face it, they're not great and some of the merits and flaws and the numia powers are stolen right from other books like Hunters Hunted and the Arcanum books.I'm a little disappointed in the content and I feel like this book could have been better."
2,Misled,The picture of the item is misleading. The tires pictured are black. The picture should be changed so that it represents the true bright blue color of the tires that were shipped. Easy to miss the color name when ordering these tires.
5,very blue,"I have no idea how to right a review. the tires I got werent what I expected but there ok.i m building a redneck recumbent trike, they will work fine"
2,"Poor quality, not worth the money",The wood is cheap and already is damaged by the weather. and that' after i put a protective sealer on it!
4,Same as above,It's the first time I ever ordered toner on line. It's fine. I don't have eight more words about this toner
3,3 stars out of 5,"I enjoyed reading this book. It is about family and the military life. It took me longer to read because parts were a bit slow, but overall a very good book."
1,oh my gawd she's turned into Patricia Gaffney,"Unlike the rest of the reviewers I didn't like this book at all. Susan wiggs writes superb romance but I guess she 's bored with them. I found Grace very unsympathetic, as I did the main character in Home before dark.Pamela Morsi and Patrcia Gaffney are two authors who have switched to this I am woman I am strong garbage and now I'll have to start looking carefully at Wiggs before I buy.I guess what I found most irritating in both Home before Dark and this book are the absolutely sensitive and perfect heroes waiting for both ladies so they really don't have to get along without a man.And 140lbs being really fat? In what universe does Ms. Wiggs exist?"
1,Borrrrrr-ing. Save your money,"It's bad enough that books are now 7.50 but who reads this kind of junk enough to make it a bestseller? I'm not that picky but I bought this book as a bestseller in my supermarket and would love my money back. The characters are shallow and unredeeming. The women pretty much perfect, whenever they aren't weeping. I want real emotion and real people, not this. If they moved in next door to me I would sell my house. I have never read this author before and I won't again. Save your money and buy someone good, like Nora Roberts or Barbara Delinsky."
3,Missing Something,"I have read all of Ms. Wiggs books. I think that this is one of her worse ones. I finished the book and felt like the ending was rushed and just too happy, almost unbelievable. The beginning of the book really draws you in but after that the events are predictable and a little boring. There are too many characters to really get to feel like you know any of them very well. I didn't feel any chemistry between the main characters. It was a great idea for a story but lacking something in the end. Save your money and borrow this one from the libaray instead. It wasn't a horrible read but after I finished it I felt like it was okay. Nothing to get excited over."
2,Okay read- NOT her best!,"This was definitely not one of Susan Wiggs' best...I much prefer her historical romances. While I liked the author's look at Navy life, her characters never truly develop and end up leaving you waiting for resolutions that never truly happen or that occur far too simply. Case in point- the author's look at rape in the book- instead of resolving the issue with the offender facing criminal charges, the person is privately sent into a rehab proram without any arrest/jail time. What kind of message is that! Hopefully her next contemporary novel will have more depth."
4,A Real Page Turner!,"Once I started reading this book, I simply could not put it down. Susan Wiggs has developed into a fine writer and this one may well be her best to date. Her character development is particularly good, and her depiction of a military family's life is right on point. I like that she created real teenagers too, complete with all the angst that is typical of those years. Anyone who has teenagers can certainly relate to the eye-rolling and high drama experienced by the two Bennett daughters.I was pleased to find a female character in her forties who was rediscovering herself. Forty-something women need to be recognized in fiction and this is a good start.The introduction of the heretofore unknown son was a bit contrived, and may not have been altogether necessary. The couple's problems were serious enough without adding him into the mix. Otherwise, the book was satisfying and well-written."
5,Hoping for more,I just spent an hour writing a great review only to lose it!! So this will be short and sweet! It was a wonderful story. I loved it and want to hear from these charming and very real people again in a second or maybe third book Ms Wiggs!!!!My husband was in the military for the first ten yrs of our marriage and I was quickly taken back to that period where I experienced many of the things Grace went through. She captures the heart and minds of the military people with excellence and detail. I especially appreciated her recognition of the sacrifice and endurance of our amazing military personnel and their loved ones at the end of the book. It's a good story for corporate families who face moves and any family who faces scruitiny and sacrifice for their jobs. Keep writing contemporary novels Ms Wiggs! You're great at it!
3,The ocean between us,"When I read this book, my husband was in the Navy and on a 6 month deployment. While I found the book slow throughout, the author does an excellent job of depicting military life, and the sacrifices that every man and woman in uniform, and their families make on a daily basis. Freedom really is not free."
2,Roughly written.,"Morris Lamb dies suddenly of what appears to be plant poisoning: his plants. When his house is sold to an Episcopalian priest and her deaf dog companion starts to have seizures, Holly Winter, dog writer and lover, starts to investigate.I have enjoyed this series that takes place in Cambridge, Ma.I'm definitely a dog person and these are definitely dog lovers books, filled with all kinds of tips and tidbits on dog companions.I was extremely disappointed in this one, however. The writing is choppy. The characters that haven't already been introduced in previous books are underdeveloped. Conant often seems to babble. I didn't really understand how her opening statements about aliens and ufo's had anything to do with dogs.The Dog Lover's Mysteries have been a favorite of mine so I'm going to give it another chance and read the next one, but I wish someone had told me earlier not to waste my time on this one."
4,Too much fun!,"This series just gets to be more and more fun. I love Holly Winter and her two beautiful Alaskan Malamutes. This book delves into the world of working dogs, more specifically hearing aid dogs. Dogs are wonderful aids for people with all kinds of disabilities. Ruffly is an adorable little mixed breed that lives with a woman who is hearing impaired, and believe me, he takes his job seriously. And we also have a murder to deal with. A murder that it seems only Holly thinks is a murder. The denouement of the murderer is also fun because we have Holly backed by her trusty Rowdy who do the unmasking. This series is definitely for dog lovers, but even those who aren't as fascinated by dogs as some of us will enjoy this warm and wonderful series."
3,Hearing ear dogs and malamutes,"I have enjoyed Susan Conant's mysteries with her two dogs. They made me want to try training another dog using her methods. I am not sure when this book was written, but it is very early in the series. Holly's thoughts were long and tedious, and the plot is somewhat light. I am intrigued by the idea of hearing ear dogs and they need more publicity. This is the weakest Conant book I have read and I am happy that it wasn't the first, because I don't think I would have tried another."
2,Ruffly Speaking,"I'm on page 186 out of 284 pages and still haven't gotten to the ""mystery"". There are some ""hints"" but nothing to peak a continued interest. Up till now, it's all about dogs and showing them. Not bad if it's ""part"" of the book but not the whole book. I've read a number of mysteries with ""themes"" that I've truly enjoyed and have continued to buy the sequels but I don't think this will happen with Ms. Conant's books. Once I start a book I do read it to the end, as I will with this one, hoping that shortly the ""mystery"" will show itself. I guess you have to be a dog lover and into all that goes with that to enjoy this book."
2,Is this a novel or a pamphlet written by the Iams company?,"Better than Bloodlines, but still not that great. Poor character development, and the fact that Conant has a tendancy to ramble make this book less than what it could have been.I'm also getting rather irritated with the author's constant free advertising plugs for Eukanuba, Iams, and some other major brand names in the pet industry. Are we reading an novel, or an informational brochure by Iams? Is she getting paid to do this, or does she really believe that Eukanuba is the best dog food on the market? (If she does, she's very ignorant on the subject of dog foods.) I don't like my novels to tell me how I should be training or what I should be feeding.I probably will not ever purchase any books written by Conant again."
5,prog meets punk,"This album had nothing to do with the birth of punk as many would like to perceive ...it did have to do with a big turnaround in direction right smack in the middle of PH's golden years. ""In Camera"" was the most Peter could go in that fabled direction. ""Nadir"" turns completely around and still manages to be original and yes dark but also complex in a way PH never was before. One might say direct , even simple but try telling some one that after reading the lyrics to ""Two Or three Spectres"". This album also began the reformation of VDGG witch one could say put out 4 more excellent albums in succession, the last one involving a line up change. Another for the ages....The middle of the Golden years' Least We can Do to Quite Zone~Fools Mate to Sitting Targets."
3,OK movie,After studying areas of Texas history which includes Sam Houston. I thought it wasn't all that great historically. We know more than indicated at the beginnning of the movie. Also about Andrew Jackson's character.
1,waste of money,"I was excited when this DVD arrived today, however, as I sat and watched it my excitement quickly disappeared. It was very obvious that this film had a low budget, the acting (apart from Sam Elliott) was pathetic, and the editing, along with the effects demonstrate that the makers of this film could not really be bothered. A waste of money and since the Australian exchange rate is poor, the waste for me was even more so! Very disappointed!"
3,"On the whole, better than Green Acres reruns.","I have to admit I'm a Sam Elliott freak. I'd watch Sam Elliott play the lead in ""The Life of Liberace."" This wasn't an epic movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it had its moments. I learned a lot about Sam Houston and the war for Texas independence, and Claudia Christian provided the eye candy. It was a little cheesy and somewhat lacking in artistic merit, but worth watching if you like Sam Elliott and/or Texas history. I'd give it a C+ overall."
3,Documentary Type,I thought the movie would portray more of his life then it did. Also there was less showing of the battles and fighting spirit that was supposedly Sam Elliot. The transitions in his life seemed a little surprising as if the movie made them appear to happen to fast. Though Elliot's portral of the great man was outstanding. And if looking at it as more of a documentary point of view it definetly rocked.
3,Slow moving Sam Houston autobiography,"Gone to Texas is a good TV movie about the life of Sam Houston. It follows Houston from his days as the Governor of Tennessee all the way through to his time as the commander of the army during the Texas War for Independence. Interweaved through it all is depictions of the fall of the Alamo, the Goliad massacre, and also the government convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos. This is also one of the only movies to show the taking of San Antonio by the Texans three months before the siege of the Alamo.This may not be very interesting to people who do not already know something about Houston or at least some background about the time. Sam Elliott is pretty good as Sam Houston with Michael Beck giving a decent performance as the knife fighter Jim Bowie. There is a very good presentation of the battle for San Jacinto as well. Interesting movie which does take a while to get going."
3,Sam Elliott is good in this movie,"I love Sam Elliott. I bought this because I like Sam Elliott, Tennessee, and Sam Houston. Nothing is particularly factual here and the picture quality of the DVD stands a lot of improvement. But a decent watch, when tired of everything else on your shelf."
5,"""REMEMBER THE ALAMO!""","""Gone to Texas"" is one of those films that resonate with truth. Sam Elliott is one of the great actors of our time, and his portrayal of Sam Houston is incredible! A fine supporting cast, and a brilliant recreation of the battle of San Jacinto! This is a movie worth owning! An awesome made-for-television historical epic! Grade: A+"
3,OK for a Cold Winter Day,"This is not the best TV movie ever made, but it's got its moments. In particular, several actors truly bring to life the people they portray. John P. Ryan personifies the jerk history knows David Burnett to have been. Richard Y'iquez and Peter Gonzales Falcon had roles much too small, as General Santa Anna and Juan Seguin, but they played them so very well. Sam Elliott, particularly in exhibiting Houston's oratorical skill, was fascinating. It comes closer to portraying the time than do many other depictions of the Texas Revolution.Given a choice between this one and The Alamo (2004), I'll take Gone to Texas."
3,Good -- Not Great,"Being from Tennessee and living in Texas, I consider Sam Houston to be an outstanding figure in our state and nation's history. I am also a huge Sam Elliott fan. I was impressed with the historical accuracy of the movie but it came across as being barely average. Elliott's performance seemed almost wooden while playing the great General Houston -- who was a larger than life character. It may have been the script, but I didn't sense any passion and energy from him. And if your lead actor is unable to carry the part in a convincing fashion, it should be no surprise that it affects the energy and feel of the entire movie. Overall, it was a solid movie, but not one that people would judge to be entertaining and memorable. I like being occasionally informed by a movie, such as this one, but I always like being entertained. This movie missed on the entertainment value, and unfortunately, one of my favorite actors seems to be responsible for its shortcomings."
2,GONE TO TEXAS,"I did not particularly liked the movie. I think it was done on the cheap, too full of cliches,macho posturing, and as usual depicted the foes of Bowie, Crockett, and other defenders of the Alamo as unconscionable, mean people, misstatements, and with omissions of truths. I personally do not recommend the movie to anyone."
3,For beginning (not experienced) programmers,"The 1st half gives you a quick and sparce overview of what you can do without VBA. It spends lots of time interducing the reader to database design, queries, forms, and tables. If you have any idea what any of these are, you will get nothing out of the 1st half of the book.The 2nd half introduces the reader to not just VBA but primarily to the concept of programming. I would say it is about 40% general programming (procedures, variables, scope, etc.), 30% idle banter, 20% useless graphics, and 10% Access specific code.If you have any programming experience, you'll be wasting your time searching for the hidden nuggets in this book. If you are new to Access and to programming, this book is a good into."
3,Functional,It works ok. In auto mode may have issues with switching in a timely manner between computers.
2,"Meh. Good idea, poorly implemented","I'm having poor results with this device. It's simple and intuitive to set up, although I'm a little confused about some of the comments here concerning a stand or cradle. Mine didn't have anything like that. It's very difficult to use the switch on the front to change from one computer to the other - the switch is cantankerous and touchy. And even when it is working - it allows the two computers to communicate with the PRINTER, but not with the SCANNER. For that, I have to unplug and rearrange cables.Overall, this was a waste. It's caused as much frustration as it's eliminated.Equipment: desktop PC, Mac laptop, HP photosmart printer"
3,"Great book, but...","Ok great book, great man, incredible and renowned command of the English language, but what in the WORLD was he thinking by not adding the PRONUNCIATIONS????? GROAN. Terrible oversight. Almost hard to believe this could be overlooked. This book would have been a BIBLE of sorts to me if it showed pronunciations. Now I am forced to go look up the pronunciation every time I find a new word I like. Sigh."
4,Take your time,"Take your time reading through this book! I've found that it's good just to flip through, pick a word, and then try to inject it into my vocab for a week. It's fun, and if you like new words like me, then you will enjoy this book."
3,The Lexicon,An interesting but not generally useful reference book. It really is written for use with a Buckly book or article.
5,"utterly usable,licentious miscibles of miso-communist","Buckley has fashioned yet another utterly usable list stoppage, badinage of detritus waiting in abeyance for the vagaries of postmodernities force fields to scour through yet another product emanation from an impeccable vainglorious watchdog for the Ruling Classes. The predictable augurs,tail wagging, arbiter elegantiae, his indolence doesn't quite proceed to the corruptible USA Senators. We have provincial sentence examples of humorous references to the rogues gallery of the communist world but his spleen venting abruptly halts itself at the shores of the Potomac. I can see/envisioned Buckley's upbeat brow turned upwards,ad spasmistaie towards the heavens,fully content with his own conceit, his odious animus against all that doesn't strike,agree,conspire congruently with capitalistic content,its resonant free world peel of greed bells."
5,Ghetto Fly,Donald Pliner is the man. The price of these shoes is great. This is a cool summer show to be worn with a soft linen outfit. If you want to stand out just a little try these kicks.
2,MO disks,"Unfortunately only half of the product that I recieved was correct. I called the company to get the correct product but they would not replace it until the incorrect had been returned, which was done. Still waiting for the correct product. The product itself was fine the service from the company was not."
2,3 piece combo,"This is what it is... cheap headset, the car charger is nice, and the case just sucks. Cheap design, you can't type on the keyboard unless you take the phone out of the pouch!"
2,Defective,I had to send this tripod back because of the condition I received it in. The bubble level had evaporated during or prior to shipping. Otherwise it may be a decent mid-range tripod.
1,There is no lifetime warranty for the lids.,"I purchased a 10 pc set 4 days ago, and the lid shattered in the sink. I was preparing to wash it. I called the Wearever warranty number and was informed that they carried no lids at all. I asked if I should return it to the store I purchased it from. She said that accepting the product back would be at their discretion. Go figure. A lifetime warranty means nothing to them. Wearever. More like whatever."
4,A Solid Account of Battle,"As could be expected, James McDonough has produced a very solid account of the Battle of Shiloh. This work is to the point and well written. The battle maps are dated. The best maps of the battle are in Larry Daniels' book, ""Shiloh"". This being said, there is still room for a major work on Shiloh. This was a large battle and it has not been brought to life as it could be. Until that time Prof. McDonough's book is a great place to start."
4,Shiloh In Hell Before Night,"""Shiloh - In Hell Before Night"" by James Lee McDonough focuses on the Battle of Shiloh (Pittsburg Landing) in April 1862. The title comes from a comment from an officer who told his men to get some water before the battle because some of them would surely die and be in hell before the day was over and would surely need the water.The author's narrative is smooth and the battle descriptions flow freely. Northern (Grant, Sherman, Buell, etc.) and Southern (Johnston, Beauregard, Hardee, etc.) are treated fairly and are complimented and criticized as the author sees fit.I enjoyed the descriptions of the strategy, battle, and aftemath. The only real problem I had was the maps - not enough and not sufficient detail as seen in other Civil War titles.Still, a good read.Recommended."
4,Good Coverage of Shiloh,This is the second telling of the battle of Shiloh that I have read (Shelby Foote's Civil War being the first). McDonough gives a very readable account of the events leading up to Shiloh. He also describes the leaders' personalities and backgrounds which sheds an interesting light on the events that occurred. Overall a very enjoyable book.
4,Well Written Account of this pivotal Battle,I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I was prepared for another complex and hard to follow book on this battle and in this case I was wrong. It was straight forward and easy to follow. The maps could have been more detailed but other than that this was a great book on this battle. Maybe not as in depth as Larry Daniel's 'Shiloh' but much easier to read. The author also covers a number of the controversies raised by the handling of this battle by both Federal & Confederate commanders. I am looking forward to reading this author's other books.
2,A brief primer on breeding;,"I needed a book on the care and training of an aby kitten--and this was not the book. What this books offers is information on the breed, what to look for in a show breed, and how to get started as a breeder. It's really a brief primer for breeders, not for the average aby owner who want to learn how to care and train a newly adopted kitten.What dismays me the most is the mis-marketing of the book. A table of contents along with a short synopis of the book's approach would have directed me elsewhere. The author is not at fault here. My two stars are really directed at the mismarketing of this book."
3,I agree,"As with the first review, I agree that more technical info is needed. As I am only a ""first- time"" Aby owner, I would have liked some more ""meaty"" info about their unique personalities. For instance, Abys are supposedly not ""lap cats"", however, mine is a ""leaner""-she likes to have half of her body on top of me (or the book I'm reading, or the sandwich I'm eating, etc.) while keeping the other half on the sofa, bed, etc. This is quite similar to the Akida (dog) that my parents had owned (although 7 lbs. ccompared to 130 is quite a difference). If you get a moment, I would love to hear again from you-I have been considering getting a Rex and then breeding both as I will be retiring soon. For anyone considering a pure-bred feline, this is the cat to choose!"
2,Not Good Enough,"If you are serious about owning an Aby, and can afford an Aby from a reputable breeder, this book is pretty lame. Buy either ""Abyssinian Cats: Everything About Acquisition, Care, Nutrition, Behavior, Health Care, and Breeding (Barron's Compete Pet Owner's Manuals)""J. Anne Helgren or ""This is the Abyssinian Cat"" by Kate Faler. These books are way more comprehensive and way more complete. I'm on my 6th Aby, and it would be tough for me to switch to any other breed. The first book I mentioned is out of print, so it's hard to find and expensive. The other book can be had 2nd hand for $3-$4. They are WAY better investments. This book doesn't even get the different colors right and has typos. If you just need a cheap book for your kids report or something like that, it would be OK."
4,Bob L,I looked for awhile before I purchased. I looked at more expensive and cheaper headsets. I am very pleased with the quality for the price.
3,Not enough value (sound quality) for the money,"For an headset that crosses the $100 line, this headset doesn't make the mark. The bass is poor (compared to others in the price range), noise cancelling is better in one ear and bad in the other, and the battery drains much faster than the Sony predecessor that i replaced with this set. I am beginning to feel that the Sony brand is sagging in general - other Sony appliances at home that are relatively new aren't doing so well either. Maybe Sony's CEO needs a ""reset"" moment similar to his peer at Toyota. I'm checking out of Sony for now given my experience with this purchase."
2,Distincty dissapointing,"The drivers and sound quality are piss poor, distorting most of the upper-mids and highs, and the garbage noise from the cancellation is massive. Get the audio-technica ones, they're much better."
4,Great,"I have a pair of these that I use when I play drums. I've seen alot of negative comments about these, so I wanted to clarify what these were made for. These headphones were not made for BASS and LOUD VOLUME. They were made to reduce the strain on your ears by allowing you to cancel outside noise, which in turn means you don't have to turn them up so loud. Expect a flatter sound out of these, and to turn the volume lower than you normally would. If you want bass and loud volume, get regular headphones. These are really great headphones, comfortable and and light-weight. My only complaint is with the noise-cancelling setting; when I'm playing my drums, I can't use the noise-cancelling feature because the outside noise is too loud for the mic, and causes and unpleasant rumble. Other than that, they are great. They still shield my ear from damaging loud noises. I highly recommend them."
1,Real Disappointment,I am a Sony Junkie.Rather than buy Bose I thought I would give Sony Noise Cancelling headphones a try. Big Mistake! I am now returning to Sony again due to malfunctions. This time the red on light has stopped working along with the right side speaker.The first return was due to contants crackling sound in the set after it had been worn for a few minutes.Furthermore the MDR-NC60 is virtually useless when used in a turbo prop or any plane that has rumbling noise. Considering I bought them to wear when I travel by plane.............I would not recommend them spend the extra on Bose.
3,sometimes they work,"These headphones have been kinda hit and miss since I bought them a few years ago. The noise canceling, to me, is just noisy static that I could usually just as soon go without. And they occasionally have a repeating click/beat that I am clueless as to where it's coming from or how/if I can stop it. But they work, I use them occasionally. They are comfortable, and except for the faults mentioned, the sound is good."
4,Very good cost benefit.,"This is a very good product.The best cost benefit I found.I tested it flying from Orlando to Brazil and worked perfect for me, all what I need.I really recomend it."
5,A Must Have For Traveler,I recently purchased this Sony headset for my overseas vacation trip. I wasn't disappointed with the sound quality and its noise cancellation. The only issue I had is that I wasn't able to use its dual converter to be used with Singapore Airlines audio socket.
5,Best for the money,My wife bought a pair of these for my birthday in January 2010 and I love them. I fly at least four times a month and never leave home without them. They are so good that I recently purchased a pair for my father as a christmas gift and he is also impressed with them. The sound quality and comfort are great and make any flight a pleasure.
5,sony headphones,Excellent headphones. Noise cancellation feature could be better but this is a very good product. I recommend it.
4,Pros/Cons,"Pros:-Great sound quality (When listening on these, I've heard some parts of songs I'd never heard before)-Noise Canceling works well (I have yet to try it on a plane or a train, but I have tried it in a room with a lot of people talking, and it does block a lot of the noise out)-The headphones look fantastic-There is a convenient button that you can press when you are using the NC feature and it stops the music so that you can hear outside noiseCons-The headphones get uncomfortable after a while of use-When the NC feature is on and you walk around, a buzzing sound in one ear is heard with every step (It gets extremely annoying, so I only use the NC feature sitting down)-The carrying case could have been designed better"
4,Vs. Bose Quiet comfort,"I compared my Sony MDR-NC60 to Bose QC 2 and 3 at a Bose store (I took my Sony into the store). This Bose store had a station specifically made for the QC headsets that plays back loud jet noises (like the airplane cabin condition). In terms of noise canceling, I couldn't detect any differences between the Boses and Sony. I like that with Sony, you can take the electrical wire off and use it only as a noise canceling headset while not listening to music. The Bose doesn't allow you to pull the wire off the headset. So, even if you are not listening to music and want to use it to cancel noise, you are still stuck with the wire hanging. Plus, the Sony was 50% less expensive. It was a no brainer for me! By the way QC3's cord does come off."
3,not as good as Bose,"I very regret to buy Sony-NC60. Before I buy this product, I tried my coworker's Bose. It is very good. However, I thought Sony should be a good one too based on its big Name. After all, its price is only half of Bose. However, when I got Sony-Nc60, I found it has a low drum sound when you turn on the Noise reduction switch, which is very uncomfortable. I called Amazon second day I got it and try to change for a Bose. They say I have to pay 25% restock fee. So I have to keep it even if I do not like it. So potential buyers, if you really want a noise reduction headphone, get a Bose. Only if you are tight for finance, you could consider this Sony-NC60.That is my real review without any favor of Bose or Sony."
1,Disappointed,"Sad to say that I too experienced the rumbling while noise canceling was on. Phoned the Sony help line and was given instructions to ship (at my expense) to Texas for exchange. It was received 16 days ago but I have been unable to get further info. I'm sure I will receive the replacement, but it is very disappointing to experience this from a brand I have been loyal to for several decades."
1,Creates Loud Noise in Right Ear,Bought these 3.5 months ago. Worked fine until a couple of weeks ago when a loud vibrating noise sounded in the right side every time the headphones were turned on. They can only be used with the power off making these an expensive not so special set of headphones. The warranty covers labor for 90days and parts for 1 year. This means I have to pay $24 plus tax and shipping to Sony to get it repaired since I'm past 90 days ownership. This will cost me over $240 total. Wish I had paid a little more and got the Bose!
5,Sony MDR-NC60 Noise canceling headphones,"These really are great. Just bought my second pair for the bedroom. They allow my wife and I to spend more time together relaxing in each other's presence. I watch on my laptop or read, she watches TV. My use of the headphones keeps us both happy. They do not cancel all noise but the comfort and ability to cancel noise when turned on is amazing. Very handy with the light so that you remember to shut the feature off so as to save the battery. Battery does last a long time. Very durable. My first pair are still in great shape."
1,Oscillating hum very annoying,"The oscillating hum I found to be quite irritating. I returned them the day I got them at no cost and received a timely refund. Kudos to Amazon.Otherwise the headphones were very comfortable and had good sound & noise cancelling quality. But the humming, vibrating oscillations made our $25 Coby noise cancelling headphones a better pick.Let's hope Sony (I expected much better) can fix this faux paus."
1,Vibrating sound when noise cancellation on,"I wish I would have read the negative reviews before purchasing. There is a vibrating sound during the noise cancellation which renders the headphones un-usable in that mode. Works well with noise cancellation off, but what good is it then. I am going to return them for credit."
1,Noise Cancelling Feature Malfunctioned after 3 days of use - returned for refund.,"The noise cancellation system failed after three days of use in my office (6 hours a day). The headphones started to emit loud feedback, static, popping noises and so on. I turned the system off and back on and the noise would return within 5 minutes. I returned the headphones for a refund. Bottom line - don't get this product."
2,Sound level is too low,I own Bose headphones and was looking for something to replace the Harmon Kardon headphones my wife broke.The Sony MDR-NC60 seemed like a good value for the price but with the volume turned up all the way on her ipod you could hear music but not very loud.I eventually purchased a pair of Beats Studio headphones which she is very happy with.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I had been interested in buying a really nice pair of headphones for a while now. I did my research and even though Bose was rated the best I did not want to spend $300. My father has a pair of Bose (Q15) so I know they are awesome and that the quality is there for the price you pay. I am a loyal Sony customer and since these headphones got good reviews I figured I'd try them out. I received them in the mail today and I'm already packaging them up to send back. I was so disappointed with this product that I'm surprised Sony would sell it. Not only is the noise cancelling not even present but the insulation of the headphones was so poor that everyone could hear what I was listening to. The only nice thing was that they were comfortable and knowing Sony they are probably very durable. I wish Sony could make a better product in this department but I guess computers and TVs are their strong suit. I would tell anyone to buy Bose over these headphones, sorry Sony."
2,20 dollar headphones and a blender!,"I tried to keep my opinion to myself, but I realize that I am doing many people a diservice. Anyway, I own 2 pair of Sennheiser and decided to purchase a pair of noise cancelling headphones. So I listened to the Bose, then went online to see if there was something comparable for less, and came upon these.I won't try to impress you with ridiculous terms like ""attenuation"" (less noise outside the headphones) or Circumaural (around the ear). Anyway, these play like a pair of twenty dollar headphones. Their idea of noise reduction is this ass irritating rumble like you are sitting next to a blender. Anyway, when the NR is on, the music in my left ear sounded like it was being played through a kazoo. So when I decided to turn off the NR, the headphones were less than impressive. Needless to say, they went back."
1,Not recommended,"After trying this headphone for a day, I sent it back. The sound quality was poor, the sound cancelling was disappointing, and it often produced an irritating squealing should for no apparent reason."
2,not worth the money!!!!,Sound quality is even worse than some in-ear ones!Bass sounds like disaster...Do not worth more than 100 bucks!Don't purchase these.
4,very comfortable,"If you looking for high quality, comfortable ware for long time, name brand, but not very high price Noise Cancellation headphone, then this is the one you need to look at.only one thing I don't like is the size, little bit too big to put in my notebook carrying case"
2,Not as good as I had hoped,Had high hopes for these to help with long international flights. Not near as good as the Bose. I would pay the extra for Bose next time.
2,Didn't last very long,"The headphones are comfortable and the sound cancellation is okay (not great) but I'm pretty mad that they didn't even last a year! I ordered these in Aug of 2011 and here it is May of 2012 and the right speaker has stopped working. These have been gently used and there is no excuse for this malfunction. All in all, they are overpriced for what equates to shotty manufacturing."
2,Great Sound - Dumb Jack Engineering,"The sound is great as many have said. On airplanes, they cancel engine and wind noise well. For me to give 3 stars to a product, EVERYTHING has to at least function. It's cool that the cable is swappable and lead me to buy them. The sales slick says it takes 3.5mm jack. What it didn't say is that it takes a non-standard very thin jack so you can't just hook up to anything. In fact, you can't hook up to most things because most jacks are too fat! These are full size cans! There's plenty of room for a normal jack slot! What were they thinking giving a skinny jack slot??? Yes, there are work-arounds and connector jockeying but I shouldn't have to compensate for poor engineering. If they wouldn't have done something that stupid, they'd get a 5.If you only use the included cord, consider this a 5 star review. If you plug into other cables, my 2 stars stands."
4,Great for movies!,"I purchased these over a year ago and still enjoy them just as much as the first day. I have tried several ""cheap"" head phones and ear buds for watching movies on the plain, these really do what it says they do. Several other reviews say they don't but I think the people were really looking for ear plugs not head phones. I have recommended them to my family and friend. They also come with a sturdy carrying case so they won't get smashed in the suitcase. Overall, very good buy!!"
2,No Support,The connecting cord quit working and there are no replacements available rendering my headphones useless after only 3 months of use. Called Sony and they were unwilling to help me locate a replacement cord.
4,"Great sound cancelling, mediocre music","This is the 3rd pair of noice-cancelling headphones I've tried from different manufacturer. Here's the short of it:Pros:- Extremely comfortable, even for large heads.- Excellent sound cancelling- Very solidly built- Great case- Price (Amazon $114, Best Buy wanted $199). Excellent value for this quality.Cons:- detachable cord is thin and probably won't last a year. Cheap & easy to replace.- Music quality is mediocre. Sound is muddy, all midrange with no clarity or bass.Summary:If you want great noise cancelling, this is the set for you... at the cost of some sound quality."
4,Not amazing but very good.,"They're very comfortable. The battery lasts a long time. They fold up nicely. The workmanship is good, and I like that you can unplug the cable and just wear them without music. The noise cancellation is good.When playing music they're not as amazing as the BOSE headphones, but I'm not that picky - these don't have quite as much bass oomph. Overall I have loved them. I use them while traveling and recommend them. The BOSE ones are just too much money, this is a better value."
2,Disappointing product from Sony,"Disappointing product from Sony. I returned them already after a day. The main positives are that they are comfortable, and sound is quality is good when not moving. However, when walking with NC on, headphones produce loud thumps (perhaps by NC trying to correct for walking thump?). I also experienced the odd vibrating in one ear that others mentioned. Comparing to my friend's audio technica headphones which are only $50 dollars more on top of the $120 for the Sony, the NC was far better."
4,comfy for big ears,i also own the nc50's and these are much more comfortable for my larger than average ears. am happy with the product and would buy again!
3,Ok for the price!,"In terms of noise canceling you hear almost everything that is going on around you, 85% is more like 40%. in comparison to the Bose QC-15's, they are almost the same. When it comes to the sound quality, Bose is by far superior but the Sony sound is still very good especially for the price. Not my worst investment but I expected much more from Sony."
3,Disapointing,"I'm a huge fan of Sony headphones and favor Sony products in general. To me the Sony MDR-V700DJ are the best sounding headphones ever - especially for bass response. That's why I'm so disappointed with the sound quality of the Sony MDR-NC60 noise canceling headphones. They are very well made and comfortable to wear, but the sound quality is awful - especially when the noise canceling feature is enabled. I recommend a direct comparison with the Bose QuietComfort 2 noise canceling headphones before purchasing these."
4,SATISFIED :),"I just received my headphones and couldn't be more happy! I have been on a headphone voyage for a little over a month now. My options were Bose, Beats by Dre, and Sony. As you could see I chose Sony."
4,Tiger,Product is very good not so sure about the price atached to it seems kinda high due to the fact it really is just another headphone but i paid it anyhow and got a good quality product
5,Phenomenal,"I had been searching for the perfect, over the ear headphones for such a long time! I am so grateful I found these! Initially I had purchased Bose headphones, (AE2), however, they were not to my liking. I am much happier with the Sony's. They are comfy, they sound fantastic, and I have an even greater appreciation for music with these. Also, they look good. Some headphones i've tried on fit oddly around my head but these hug my head perfectly! LOVE them."
1,Don't Buy,"These headphones are worthless. The sound quality is that of very inferior earbuds. I was not impressed by the noise cancellatin either. I returned them and instead got Sony MDR-v700. These do not have noise cancellation but are about $30 cheaper and sound is bright, lively, clear and excellent."
2,NO BASS!,"I think that these are a good set of headphones for the most part but, EXTREMELY OVERPRICED and the bass is equal to the bass on headphones from the 1970s or something. They have amazing clarity but I, for one, LOVE BASS. The MDR-NC60 model was not what I was looking for at all. Bose wins this one hands down. In fact the $70 Skullcandy headphones have subwoofers in them and the bass blows the sox off the MDR NC60's. I'm returning these for a Bose pair first thing in the morning."
2,8.1 vs. 10.2,"8.1 oz vs. 10.2 oz...that's it! I recently purchased the NC50's and I love them. Like many others, I know someone who has the Bose QC's...and he's mad now because my 50's beat his $399 headphones hands down! So what does that 8.1...stuff mean? That's the only difference between the NC60 and NC50. Check out the Sony site! They have exactly the same specs! I couldn't believe it. Okay, the 60's are a bit smaller. If it's worth fifty bucks to you then go for it. Me? I'll save fifty on the fifty. Congrats to the genius in the sony marketing dept for the idea of just putting a 60 on the side and charging $50 more! You're the man!...or woman!"
3,Delayed Legacy,Typical story of a son whose father died before his birth; his discovery of his parents'letters during the war and his quest to fill in the blanks. Most interesting is the irony of the search from the other side of the ocean!
5,Great stories that will have you wanting to read more!,"Six classic tales featuring the priest-sleuth, Father Brown. Excellent tales, they are engaging and addictive, and will leave you looking for more!"
5,Intuition First,"All the math in the world would be useless in any applied subject without physical intuition about the phenomena and a clear passage between the intuition and the math. Pedlosky's book has it all - intuition and math. I have loved studying it as my first step in the direction of geophysics from a career in pure mathematics. The book is clear, easy to read, interesting, fascinating. Thank you Pedlosky for a magnificent textbook."
3,Mildly Intereresting Gimmick Book,"This book is easy reading and has some interesting tibits. However, some of the events the author chooses for his timeline are on the trivial side--for instance, the trial of Bill Mitchell. Some historical events are simplified--unavoidable certaintly, but also occasionally unfortunate. It is questionable whether the Mongol Empire really lasted 490 years. Very little of it was left at its end for it to really have been considered an empire. There is at least one typo--I seem to recall more--but the Civil did NOT begin on ""April 12, 1862"" (p. 48). Flanagan, the author, says so at the top of the page. Then there is question of how he decided which events to include in this timeline. Obviously, an effort was made to include events that increased a bit more in their time span one after another--a difficult task, to be sure--but the question at the end of a book without a theme other than time is, so what?"
2,Overuse of the already OVERRATED Titanic,"The author devotes two passages, or chapters if you will, to the completely historically --and politically-- unimportant Titanic. One chapter is how long it took the ship to sink to sink. Another is how many years the overrated ship stayed at the bottom of the sea. What's wrong Flannagan couldn't find anything better to write about or are you just a real Titanic-nerd? Even the chapter on the politically important sinking ship, the Lusitania (which launched the USA into WW1 two years later) has a reference to the trivial Titanic!"
3,Cut to Almost fit,"This is a fairly large sheet of very flexible foam, about a quarter-inch thick that arrives either in a small flat 8""x8"" box or in a plastic bag about the same dimensions. So the foam sheet will be folded to fit. When unfolded to be cut to size, it will be slightly distorted or wrinkled, so you should lay it on a flat discardable surface and, while using a stiff straight edged object like a yardstick, cut it with a razor blade or box cutter. Even then, the pieces may be bowed somewhat, so they don't fully conform to your filter's shape, thus allowing dust to infiltrate around the edges. By the way, I have three different brands of Air Cleaners, and after cutting these pre-filter materials to the appropriate shapes for them, there's always a significant amount left over as trim waste. Other than that, they work pretty well."
3,Engineer Review,"Product is not cut to fit, so you will need to do this yourself. Size issue could be improved by better engineering and manufacturing techniques."
5,Terrific Introduction,"I am very pleased with this book. Davis begins by orienting Lev's work within Husserl's phenomenology and distinguishes Lev from Heidegger. So many thinkers are difficult to comprehend because lousy intro books don't place them in context. Davis elegantly relates the role of ethics in distinction to Heidegger's concerns. He goes deeper by discussing the influence of Descartes and Kant leading to Lev's postmodern ethic. Davis writing is direct, yet still conveys passion for Lev's accomplishments. Finally, he consistently iterates that he is in some ways doing a disservice to Lev by paraphasing his work into a meager introduction. It may have disserved Lev, but it sure helped me and many others. Great book I highly recommend."
2,"Use the internet, it's more useful.",A lot of what's in this book isn't very helpful. The remedies are all pretty basic and not very well explained on why you would do them. I work w/ animals and wouldn't recommend this book to any of the owners we see.
2,TOO BROAD IN SCOPE; TOO SHALLOW FOR DOGS.,"WHILE THIS VOLUME TOUCHES UPON SOME VERY HELPFUL REMEDIAL TREATMENT, IT SERVED AS A KIND OF ""TEASER"" FOR THE READER WHO REQUIRES SOME MORE DEPTH AND COMPREHENSIVENESS. IT MAKES YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR MORE ELSEWHERE."
5,Meaningful insights into emotional and spiritual well-being,"Take A Deep Breath: The Haiku Way To Inner Peace is the combined work of Sylvia Forges-Ryan, a well-known American haiku poet, and her husband, Edward Ryan, a psychologist, that presents meaningful insights into emotional and spiritual well-being, placed side by side with inspirational haiku poetry embodying the inner lessons being taught. Take A Deep Breath is recommended as being a thoughtful, practical, ""reader friendly"", aid to discovering and nurturing a personal tranquility within. ""Summer afternoon/last notes on the music box/dragging""."
5,Take a Deep Breath right now,"As soon as you take this lovely book in your hands you will feel calmer and yet exhilarated. The imagery and form of each haiku/ meditation encourages the reader to take a journey into the self and allows us to find wonder and meaning in the world very close by. In these all too troubled times, Take a Deep Breath is a much needed gift."
5,Overcome With Great Inspiration,"Great video if you like Contemporary Christian music. The story of how this concert came about, is an even more incredible, and unforgettable story; I learned about it on You Tube. It shows how that from tremendous pain, comes victory."
4,A Great Bit for Drilling Glass,"This is a wonderful bit! I like that it is a four-sided bit vs. a two-sided drill bit. I was able to drill holes in about 20 bottles before the bit started to dull. I just wish that I could order these drill bits individually. I do not need the two large size bits, so this was the only draw back regarding this set. I would order more of these bits if I could order several of the specific size that I need. Unfotunately, they are only sold by the set. Otherwise, great drill bit!"
3,what?No anamorphic?,"Fine camerawork and editing are undercut by the lack of anamorphic mastering which in a widescreen video produced in 2006 is inexcusable. Also the unplugged format doesn't really serve Pixies music well. Because despite the obvious influences from the Talking Heads and the Police, the Pixies aren't really about music. They aren't really about playing guitars. Theirs is an impressionistic sound in which the effect is the point of the song. The lyrics mean whatever you happen to think they mean. Take away Santiago's distortion and half the sound and fury is gone.Because of the quick cutting video in Pixies Sell Out it looks like the Club Date is the concert video to have."
5,Great bars.,"Hey, Lindby bars are not for everyone, but they are versatile, rugged and functional.Put some pegs on and you have 3 riding positions to keep your legs limber on long rides.Had them on my sporty and I was on the road in 15 minutes."
5,Amazing!,"This book is incredible! The information is so meticulous yet so easily explained! If you want to know more about what goes in your mouth and how your body responds to it, read this book! It is as old as I am but has, still, an outstanding relevance! Much info. I am sure has been updated but the basics are still the same and some of the things they knew back then (food and health issues) have proven them correct by exploding! Read it! (Shipping was quick on this book, as always through Amazon, and of course, prices for item and shipping were great!)"
3,Book to technical,I feel the book has to much technical stuff bunch in together.. More just facts on different areas. Doesn't tell you a specific diet plan. I didn't find user friendly
2,Not what I expected to receive,I am not pleased with my purchase from this seller. The book I received does not look like the book I ordered online with the exception of the title. The book has a torn page with a post it sticky holding it together. It also has numerous highlighted areas throughout the pages. I have ordered books from many different sellers that are always listed in good or like new condition and have never received anything torn or marked throughout. I will more than likely not be ordering from this seller in the future.
2,Just OK,"This book is strong on charm but weak on expertise. For example I think whenever your explain there are two styles of wood framing, balloon (as in light as a ...) and platform, you should point out the former, requiring studs two stories long, was replaced by the latter a hundred years ago, and is virtually unused today. On the other hand he recommends having a portable toilet on site so as not to ""upset your new neighbors"". Best as an introduction for beginners. You'll need to read others."
2,okay for general intro,"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Building Your Own Home does okay as an introduction; it is an easy read and has some good tips and refreshing humor too. However, it seriously lacks in its commission when it comes to actually doing anything beyond the 'kicking the tires' stage of building."
3,"Helpful, but some of their drawings are wrong.","This is a good intro to things to think through as you consider building your own home. But one important diagram is stunningly mistaken. The diagram on page 206 ""Framing for a Window"" is not correct. Correct construction is a KING jack stud (runs from bottom plate to the top plate), then the TRIM stud (that goes next to the king stud and goes from the bottom plate to the header) and then a CRIPPLE stud (that goes from the bottom plate to the window sill). Well, on page 206, the left side of the diagram correctly locates the King stud and the Trimmer, but then offers no Cripple stud. The right side of the diagram correctly locates the King stud but then has no Trim stud and no Cripple--rather it has a stud going from the sill to the header! I mention this particular diagram because it is one that novice builders/remodelers will need and will thus be misled. And second, it causes me not to trust some of the other diagrams."
1,Bad Recomendation,This necklace was suggested to buy with my Thor's hammer pendant from silver insanity. The problem is that it doesn't fit with the charm! The leather fell apart as I tried to fit it through. Try a 24 inch stainless steel chain instead.
2,poor quality,"My order arrived quickly but upon FIRST use, the clasp broke on this necklace. Since it wasn't an expensive item, I joined the ends together with a small wire ring I already owned, since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced...perhaps with another faulty item. As they say, ""you get what you pay for!"""
3,"Nice chain, but silver clasp was broken","Overall, this is a very nice leather chord necklace. Unfortunately, the silver clasp of the one I ordered was broken when I opened the package - that's why I gave it only three starts. Otherwise, I would have given it five stars."
5,amazing,"Keith Carter's book, Bones, is both beautiful and inspiring. The images of dogs are simple but ethereal. This is a book I revisit frequently. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates photography and/or has great affection for man's best friend."
2,"Decent Resource, But Major Mistake on pg 96","I bought this book because I wanted some easy recipe ideas for my toddler with some of the basic ingredients that I would have on hand. This book appears to satisfy that criteria.However, readers should note that there is a very important mistake about allergens on page 96. In Chapter 6: Foods for Your Crawler: 6-12 Months it says ""Keep in mind that you must continue to avoid such potential allergy items such as cow's milk, eggs (although egg whites are okay), strawberries, nuts and honey."" Actually, egg whites ARE NOT OKAY at that age - egg yolks are ok."
5,Great Book,"I loved this book, very educational. I now make all of the food for my 4 month old daughter."
2,It works but not as you would presume it should !!!,"There is no problem with the card or capacity. But when I compare my results with Lexar 12X card, there is NO difference in the time it takes to store the image ( once you click the camera ) !!!. Yes, restoring images from the card to computer is very fast compared to my 12x card. But while snapping photos there is no difference in speed. This could be because of the camera or some other reason...but my main reason to buy a 40x card was to snap photos as fast as possible.By the way I am using this card in Nikon 5700 camera. Make sure that your camera supports the Write Acceleration Technology. he CF card will work, **BUT** there was no increase in speed over other cards."
5,Great Concert,"Great renditions of Brian's music . A must have ,or at least watch, for any Brian wilson fan .I really enjoyed it ."
3,Half baked,"A nice tribute but for the most part half-hearted. Aside from The Brian Wilson band the only song I truly felt was Jeff Beck's Surf Up, those notes bleed soul. Since they are all Wilson's songs no performance is truly bad oh wait Richie was awful but the rest is enjoyable enough. If you are a Beach Boys and Wilson fanatic chances are you will be better off listening to these songs performed by the original artists."
2,Could have been better !,"If you compare this item with the James Taylor Tribute, there is a huge difference in quality and presentation. Some artist did a fantastic job while others were very poor. I loved and cherish JT's DVD but this one.. I could have let it pass !"
4,Brian Wilson still rocks!,"I originall purchased this dvd for Jeff Beck`s performance, and was pleasantly suprized by the entire show. Everyone does a good job bringing their unique styles to Brian`s music. Great versatility!Cheers!"
3,John Legend Nails It.,"This tribute wasn't as strong as the 2001 tribute held at Radio City Music Hall. Having said this, it's worth purchasing just for John Legend's mesmerizing performance of the Pet Sounds track I JUST WASN'T MADE FOR THESE TIMES. Even though Brian Wilson's band backs up Legend on this version, and the original arrangement is left more or less intact, this most excellent band does bend the arrangement ever so slightly, giving it a bit of a groove so as to cradle Legend's soulful voice and delivery. Legend obviously understands the material implicitly, which is surprising considering his youth and the fact that the material is over 40 years old. His performance showcases how timeless Brian's music can be as long as the artist understands the musical complexity and emotional directness Brian was such a genius at creating with his songs."
2,REJECT THIS,"UPDATE: It's true I have not read the book but I do know from personal and professional experience that the late Wyatt, Coruke and others are not qualified to make the claims that they do or have done. Once you question them on particular issues - they threaten to sue...be a Berean and check em out with credible organizations. Clever video editing and PR does not make a wannabe a credible archaeologist.Anything having to do with Ron Wyatt, Bob Cornuke, Michael Rood etc. Reject! These are ""Headline Indiana Jones"" Wannabee's. There are many fine Bible Believing Archaeologists but they are rarely interviewed or acknowledged.My List of Credible Organizations...- The Near East Archaeological Society- The Associates for Biblical Research- The Institute for Biblical Archaeology- World of the Bible Ministries"
4,"Anchors, Maltese divers, ...and oh yeah.. Paul","The worst thing about Cornuke's books...is that they have to end.I'm not sure if he's got the same Ghost writer on this one, but I've enjoyed all 3 of the books I've bought from the 4 Cornuke has produced.This book is an adventure by proxy of the early days of diving...and the discoveries made by those lucky enough...and daring enough to be there.The Maltese fishermen of the 60's and 70's had no way of knowing what they had found. Cornuke however has done the best job possible in proving that the lead anchor stocks pictured in the middle of the book, ARE in fact...the anchors spoken of in Acts 27.The events of the book touch upon Sept. 11, 2001. I'm not sure I followed Cornuke's attempt to make the discovery somehow spiritually relevant to today.It's a cool discovery, but spiritually significant? Guess you'd have to be there.Regardless of how I felt though, I do highly recommend the book. Incredible adventure and some apologetics mixed in."
5,The Lost Shipwreck of Paul,"Amazing detective work!Bob Cornuke has found the physical evidence that confirms Luke's account of Paul's shipwreck..... right down to the depth of the water! Incredible! A ""must read"" for anyone interested in discovering historical truth."
3,"Cheap, and not bad. Just not a permenant solution.","These were the cheapest wireless microphones that would suffice for my church's needs. They worked pretty well for a while, but seem to need replaced after a year or so. I'm not unhappy with the purchase, but it's what i paid for."
5,Yummy for the Tummy,I tried this product recommended by my chiropractor and found itso beneficial. It eliminates gas and heartburn with natural ingredients.
2,Pills got sticky,"I bought this to help with achy joints and to ward of arthritis. I did not really notice any change after taking this product, so I decided to only take it on dark dreary days since it is supposed to help with depression, too. The pills started ""leaking"" and getting sticky. I have to use a butter knife to extract one from the container and to unstick it from its neighbors. I found that taking glucosomine/chondroitin and turmeric/ginger (10:1) capsules that I fill myself twice-a-day has helped tremendously--along with other vitamins and supplements and getting some cardio exercise!"
2,Interference with charging plug,Looks OK and fits the phone. But it interferes with the charging plug. Not enough clearance for the cut out area where the charging socket is.
4,Gift,The same as for the other prism I purchased. For my three year old granddaughter who is fascinated by the prism/rainbow effect.
4,Good prism for the price,Overall I am satisfied with this prism. I don't use it very often since it just sits on a shelf in my office. It works okay at splitting light but isn't a high end optical device by any means. The plastic base is rather cheaply made as well. Overall for $10 It's a good deal. I wouldn't pay much more than that for it though.
3,Wish it was made out of glass,"After looking for a glass prism, I just couldn't find it, so I ordered this one that is made of clear plastic.It probably doesn't work as well as a glass one, and it's a little bit tricky to get it to produce rainbows.But eventually it does, you just have to make sure that is very, very clean, wiping off any fingerprints with a microfiber cloth -the ones used to clean eyeglasses.Great educational value, I'd say a classic. But again, I wish it was made out of glass!"
2,This is not a Prism,"They need to take the word ""Prism"" off this product. Maybe it's a ""light crystal"" whatever that is, but it is certainly not a prism. I had a few small prisms as a kid, little ones about a quarter of the size of this thing, and they made rainbows in the light. This doesn't make rainbows from any light source I've tried. My other family members, looking at the item and the package, tried to tell me that it isn't meant to make rainbows, and isn't a prism so I shouldn't expect it to. They didn't read the product description here and buy the silly thing though. It' mostly just a hunk of plastic, it has some vague kaleidoscopic properties with the little rainbow cards it comes with, but all in all it is mostly just a useless hunk of clear plastic. Cheap, but pointless."
4,Acrylic Rainbows,"A prism made of plastic. I thought that word ""crystal"" meant glass and was surprised to find a toy made of plastic. It's a bit ""milky"" and there are discernible imperfections, but to illustrate the basic properties of light, specifically that bending light changes its frequencies, this product suffices."
1,Not glass,I wanted a cheap glass prism that would cast a rainbow into the room from the window. This is not glass but plastic and it does not cast a rainbow at all. I could not get but a few spot of colored light. disappointing!
3,Don't expect a vibrant spray of colors.,"I am going to start with what this prism isn't. It isn't going to produce a shower of color all throughout your room. It isn't going to be that spectacular without a strong light source (no, your flashlight isn't going to enough...unless you have some high powered super flashlight).Now, for what it is. This prism will show you (and your children) how light bends by doing several different experiments (just creative). If you have a good sunny spot you can set it in you will get a good rainbow as well, not a lot of them, but you will get color. Lastly, and probably the most consistent (and fun) use, the kaleidoscope effect is a lot of fun and you can take the time with your kids making many new patterns on light weight posterboard and seeing what happens.For the price it is not a bad investment, but be warned. This is not the suncatchers you might remember from the 80's."
1,not what you think.,Cheap acrylic prism that doen't really work as a prism but more as a kaleidoscope to see a rainbow colored paper. Not a true prism. If you are looking for a prism this is not it.
2,sad,"Well, yes, it looks good on display sitting on your shelf. But as for creating a striking prism rainbow i remember creating in 5th grade (decades ago) with a real crystal prism - it simply does not deliver at all. A standard household flashlight with new batteries should be enough to do the job but it doesnt. You can barely see colors on the outside fringes of the beam and you will need to hunt for them by rotating the prism. :("
2,not very exciting,"My 3 year old daughter wanted a ""rainbow"" for Christmas. I thought this would be a nice way to give her one - and teach a little science lesson at the same time. I liked that it was acrylic, which makes it much safer and more durable for a young child. Unfortunately, it barely works, which just makes it frustrating for a young child. If I shine a very bright light on it, in an otherwise dark room, and get the angle JUST right, I can see a tiny, dim rainbow. That's it. I'm keeping it b/c it was inexpensive and not really worth sending back, but it was a bit disappointing."
2,Not what I remember from school.,"As others have said, it was not the vibrant and bright rainbows I remember from school. I remember getting SOME color separation out of a bright flashlight. But as others have suggested, that was probably because those prisms were made from something other than acrylic.This one, I could not even get a separation of colors with sunlight through a window. Much less using a flashlight or any other artificial light source. Maybe a photographers lamp or bright worklamp would get something.All that said, there is a way to get a pretty dramatic set of bands. What you want is for there to be very bright direct sun near an open doorway or a shadowed area, preferably about mid-day. You want the sun to shine into the prism and refract such that the resulting rainbow forms in the shaded area (I did mine at the door to my garage). I managed to get a band of color that was about 4-5 inches wide and about 12 inches long on the floor of my garage doing that."
3,A Science Fair Staple,"We bought 2 prisms for a science fair project - white to colored light comparison. We had difficulty getting a large enough spectrum to photograph for the results section of the report. Thank photo shop that we were able to blow up the resulting spectrum into visible bands. I am not sure if I would consider the prisms toys, unless you expect your child to be a science prodigy. They do make lovely desk decor once the fair is over."
3,Gift,"fun item, not glass, can not be used as a paper weight (to light), it does make a rainbow but not as easily as a real glass one does."
3,"If you can't play fast enough to rip off Adrenalin O.D., do the Ramones!","""The idea of setting yourself up as a derivative band is a road that leads nowhere"" - Frank Zappa. At least Weasel doesn't talk about meditation and drop the names of famous authors and philosophers who ""influenced"" his writing on this one. Riverdales, Black Crowes, Yngwie Malmsteen, what's the difference? Oh yeah, Malmsteen is introverted and unprententious in comparison."
4,Uplifting interpretations & descriptions,"I previously utilized a couple other books by a different author and they slant toward the negative and it was really nice to have a fresh, brighter interpretation and description of the cards and their influences. I'm doing readings for people and when I reference the books I want to have a more positive approach toward the card meanings so I may share a this perspective and provide hope and guidance toward improving life situations through awareness of influences and ways to affirm joyful, effective growth. It was a pleasure reading this book by these authors and it helped reaffirm my mission."
5,A Must Have for the Serious Psychic,"This subject is vital for anyone who is into astrology, metaphysics, Tarot cards, or the occult. It will teach you much about your personality, skills, and talents, and those you love and work with. On a personal note, I have used this system to read the destinies of over fifty thousand people at numerous psychic parties and private psychic consultations. It is a crucial element of personality analysis. It and associated works (you might Amazon-search ""destiny cards"" for other excellent books as well) all come from the classic SACRED SYMBOLS OF THE ANCIENTS by Edith Randall and Evelynn Campbell, which is now out of print but available for like $100.00 on Amazon. These and some other books which you can track on my purchases, are well worth the price."
3,This is a great book,This is is a good book which teaches you about yourself and when you meet a man or your friends what type of person they are and how to get along with them
3,"Surprisingly fun Gamera flick, but Gappa...","Gamera flicks have rarely been known to be good movies, but Gamera vs. Jiger (or Monster X) isn't half bad...of course, it isn't half good, either, but it's entertaining enough for the kiddies, and has some rather creative elements, but, like all of the Showa Gamera R1 dvd's, the transfer is absolutely horrid, but the dubbing is only somewhat painful. Get it to complete your collection.As for Gappa, aka ""Monster From a Prehistoric Planet,"" it's a nifty extra treat for kaiju fans...if you enjoy absolutely awful dubbing and rather sub-par SPFX. The Gappa monsters themmselves are basically combinations of Godzilla and Rodan, but they're still pretty creative (especially their roars).Overall, a decent disc, considering that it's the best that we're going to get here in the US."
2,Not The Best in Showa Gamera Series,"The movie is slow and it takes a while before it gets going, but when it does, the movie is pretty good. It has a classic scene when Gamera puts electric poles in his ears to block out the high frequency noise. It's funny to watch him fight Jiger a.k.a. Monster X with electric poles sticking out of his ears! Overall pretty good, but definitely not the best out of the Showa series."
2,When Will I Learn ....,"On the back of the book, the author says something about you'll either like Jacy or hate her, but, you know drama is going to happen with her. Well, I didn't like Jacy and I could have cared less in what happens to her. At least, when a writer creates a character that's not very nice, there's always something redeeming about them that you can relate to - not with Jacy.Very rarely do I have such a negative reaction to a character; the only reason why I finished this book, because I brought it. I am not a fan of the latest trend of ""urban"" books, but, I thought this book would be different ... hmm, no such luck. Then the way it ended? I barley finished this book, why would I chunk down additional monies for the sequel?Bravo to the author. You got my money this time ... but not anymore ..."
3,thugs & fun,"The book was an OK read, I mean in Lieu of all her ""pretty ness"" and all the brand name labels thrown around, it was as close to reality for some than just a typical man saves a woman novel. Jacy was really smart, and had a lot going on in her life professional and personal. A woman that has never been in LOVE. But came very close to it and not to Keen on taking a chance either.I guess part 2 will fill us in on why Terrell was in the hospital and or who beat him and why. I would suspect that part 2 will also fill us in on what happened with Rich, he seemed like a cool kind of dude that might have been good for Jacy had she let her guard downI don't think what Rich did with neecey was any worse than what jacy allowed Terrell to do to her i mean a tit for tat.. I feel like they could have worked past that.. JMO..Anyway I'd say this was worth the read"
4,Page turner,"I ran across this book by accident and I'm so happy that I did. Thugs Are For Fun, is urban fiction at it finest, with many Listens to be learned. The things that the main character goes though in this story is similar to many female's jounery, which makes it empowering, uplifting and entertaining, while still being eye opening. I have read the series to this book an I'm looking forward to reading more books from this author. Take my word for it Thugs Are For Fun is a most read. ( don't forget to read two and three as while :-)"
3,Entertaining...,"I found myself rooting for the ""thug"" and not the girl who tries to play him. THis is a different type of urban fiction, it shows us the unseen side of the thug, that shows us that they are real people too."
4,CSA the Confederate States of America,This is a what if movie that has the Southern states winning the rebellion. This is diffently NOT POLICIALLY CORRECT and needs to be takin in that frame of mind. I have enjoyed watching it.
2,Could be a lot better,"Although an interesting topic, I am not a fan of movies or books based on alternative historical contexts or situations. CSA strives to be witty, satirical, biting, and accurate while missing most of those marks. I don't think it comes across as overly overt or racist and racism is still an issue in the US, but this really takes the it's own examples too far. The commercials in the film stand on their own and have true historical relevance, which is explained at the end of the film. This is a film that may come up in future conversations with friends and family, but I would not just outright recommend it to anyone."
4,A slap in the face to southern culture,A mockumentary yes...historically implausible perhaps but this film captures the essence of southern thinking today. There is a distinct undercurrent of racism in all southern politics. The American Civil War created an insecurity complex within southerners much like WWI created in the French. In my view there won't be much outcry about this film from the sons of the soil because for them this represents the dream that could have been. What we need is another John Brown sweeping though the south expunging both statehouses and trailer parks alike. Perhaps then mankind will be able to transcend and evolve with some equality for all.
1,Propaganda Gone Wild,"Unfounded northern propaganda taken to the extreme, with no foundation in history. It takes the false assumption that the south had any interest in conquering the north which was as likely as Washington invading England. it also assumes that the south was interested in forcing everyone to have slaves when the Confederate Constitution clearly band the buying & selling of slaves. I give this movie more stars than it deserves because their was no place for a negative sign. no historical value AT ALL !"
1,Almost painful to watch,"I had high hopes for this ""movie"" but after about 15 minutes I was sorry I wasted my time with it. Yes, it's a fake documentary that supposedly shows what America would be like had the South won the Civil War. To begin with the South wasn't fighting to take over the North, it was fighting to split away from the North, so the premise that the Confederacy would have stretched from sea to sea and North to Canada is just wrong to begin with. Even ignoring that fact however this was just predictable and worse, boring. If I had the chance I'd never have wasted my time with this- I was always hoping it was ""going to get good"" any minute- but it never did."
1,Disgraceful waste of time.,"This movie is probobly the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of watching.It is historically incorrect and fails to mention that there were literally thousands of free black men living in the south, that there were many blacks fighting for the Confederacy and that there were Jews not only in the Confederate army ( Colonel Myer whom the Fort in Florida is named after ), but also in the Confederate Government ( Judah Benjamin ). Finally and most interestingly, the Confederate President Jefferson Davis had a black adopted son who was torn from the hands of his wife by Yankee soldiers when Davis was arrested. The boy and mother screamed and cried as the Northerners carried him away. Lee, neglects to mention that the war started not because of slavery, but rather because of repressive taxes imposed on the Southern states.This movie is a pathetic attempt to rewrite history by a dishonest man.Don't waste your time with this peace of stinking garbage."
5,Funny,"This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. It rightly mocks the south for its continued revisionist views of the Civil War. Face it, you lost, and men such as Stonewall Jackson are not heroes but traitors on the level of Benedict Arnold."
1,"It get's one star for being In Focus, most of the time.","THis is a really bad joke ! This thing is FULL of lies and rehtoric.It wss the troops from the North who were the one murdering innocents. The Southern leaders had come to realize that slavery was not going to last and shouldn't, some questioned whether it should have ever happened at all.One of the biggest falsehoods was that the south wanted to take over the north, which is a complete lie. It was NOT a ""civil war"" it was a War Between the States. All the Southern States wanted was their Independence to preserve States Rights. The notions about slavery in this film are pure FICTION !The film is WORTHLESS for it's complete INaccuracy and should not be viewed by anyone. It barely qualifies as poor propaganda.If you believe anything in this film to be historic fact, then you know NOTHING of American or Confederate history."
1,Not funny...Not good...Not entertaining,"I wanted to like this movie because the premise was interesting. The movie was horrible. Not worth the money to buy new, used, or to rent."
3,Interesting,"Not what I would call ""incisive satire,"" but it makes some good points and does so in an interesting and entertaining way. I guess you have to be somewhat ""ham-handed"" to get through to closed minded bigots and this movie does a pretty good job of making its point."
2,CSA: Confederate States of America,"Interesting Idea by Mackinley Kantor, but blown out of proportion by this Film. I give it two stars for outlandish humor and 0 stars for content. This next donation to my local library for it's book/DVD sale is where it will end up. The $1.00 the library will get is about what it's worth."
1,Pretty shallow . . . perhaps it tried too hard.,"Not much to say, really. After the first 3-4 commercials using outdated racial stereotypes to illustrate that the Confederacy (news flash!) had African slaves, I ""got it."" Then, when the 'annexation' of the US by the CS was briefly mentioned, I'd had enough. The historical substance was an inch deep and a mile wide, and the comedy just wasn't funny, even if it was supposed to be biting satire. Those who are unrefined products of public education circa 1990-present may find this deep and incisive but serious history students, and even avid buffs, will find it thin and cloying."
1,Waste of time,This is a movie made by foreigners who don't understand America or the Civil War. Their own bigotry overshadows any attempts at humor. Couldn't understand what the motive for making this movie was then at the end it shows Spike Lee had a hand in it. Nuf said!
2,interesting,"Quite a different look at what the country COULD be like, if the south had one. A very twisted view. It is full of racial conflict and unneeded racial discrimination. I can only surmise that the writer and or director are trying to portray a parody of life, quite a sad portrayal."
3,Has forbidden words!,I got this movie to have a film record of some of the 'forbidden words' that are being removed from popular culture. A lot of the premise is very weak and the proposed progression of events unsubstantiated. Also a lot of whining about products.
5,movie great,Everything was great the shipping was fast the dvd played well the content of the film was outstanding good lord it was a movie it worked asking for 20 words is stoopid
5,The Reviewers are Right,"This movie is almost beyond description. At times it is funny. At times it is embarrassing. Sometimes it is outrageous, and at times it is almost ""over the top."" It is definitely ""in your face."" As one reviewer said, it can be summed up best as ""Spike Lee.""CSA is not for everyone. But if you are willing to let your thought processes be challenged a bit, this is a very entertaining and thought provoking piece of work. I am very glad I rented it."
4,Interesting concept!,"I am a U.S. history teacher in a public school system. The students, even the African-American's enjoy the ""What if?"" idea of the movie. It is so realistic at times you forget you are watching a made up documentary until the commericals come on. They are soo over the top and out there that they make you mad and sad all in one. Some of the things made me laugh aloud, while others made me very upset. This is a really good piece for someone interested in history and the idea of ""What if's?""!"
3,"Alt.History at its greateh...eh, average...","This is exactly what people are championing it to be; an average alt.history flick. Its very interesting, and provocative, etc, however, the Family Tree subplot is boring. Other than that, its pretty decent. I'm not regretting owning. I'm just... Eh. Its not SpinalTap."
2,Overdone and Overblown,"Could have been truly humourous and insightful, but missed the mark. The entire US going to the CSA if the South won is ludicrous. It needed a deft and soft touch. The satire fell short of accomplishing its goals."
3,Confederate States,"The movie is funny in parts and silly in parts. Could have taken a more realistic ""what if"" type of view."
1,It's bad...offensive bad,"The movie is a number of bad sketch comedy bits strung together to suggest what the Confederacy might have done if successful in their attempt to secede.Yes, of course they would have started with annexation of the North (?). Then both hilariously and credibly, this thing suggests they would have extended slavery's economic and political feasibility not just through the 19th century but all through the 20th...and then get in league with Hitler...Um, just put it this way. People who like this drek seem to agree that it's strongest part is the early part and that strongest among this is Lincoln in blackface, acting like a coward and a fool. Sound good? Then this, thing, is for you. Otherwise, be prepared to feel an unpleasant admixture of horror, distinct discomfort and boredom."
3,"Tasty sausage, questionable delivery practice","These Merguez were delicious, and immediately transported me back to Paris where I first tasted this North African delight. I was tempted, however, not to actually eat them. They arrived well wrapped, and packed with melted ice packs, and they didn't feel particularly cold to the touch. I was concerned that they may have been in the temperature danger zone for growth of food borne pathogens. . . ie -- I was worried they'd make me sick. But I REALLY like merguez, so I tasted a small sample. . . Didn't get sick, so we ate the whole batch safely. HOWEVER, they should do a better job packing -- maybe dry ice?"
5,Coming of age in the 70's,"Some call this book a female answer to ""Catcher in the Rye."" In many ways, Eveline's journey is similar to that of Holden Caulfield, but she lives as much on the page as any written construct I've encountered and deserves her own place in the sun. So much of this book reminds me of growing up in the 70's and 80's, living through this time, I found myself nodding my head as I turned the pages. ""Anthropology of an American Girl"" is a very tough read, but a worthwhile one as well.Rebecca Kyle, May 2010"
1,awful / hated it / could not finish it,"the characters drove me nuts, the plot was confusing and annoying, and it felt like a chore to read. so i quit about 1/2 way thru. wish i could get my money back on this ebook. :-("
2,Depressing,This book is really depressing. I was really excited to start reading it based on the rave reviews. It started out great and then it just became painful to read. I felt depressed almost the entire time while i was reading it. It also was not realistic at all. The writing was beautiful and the characters were very well developed but the the book is downright depressing.
5,Superb,"I am a voracious reader, and usually I consume books rapidly. The best way I can describe this book is that it consumed me instead of the other way around.You will be drawn in to the narrator's mind and hear the story from her innermost thoughts and feelings. You will feel her frailty, her anxiety, as well as her sucesses. The stream of consciousness is crafted expertly. Within the first page you will feel consumed by ""Evie"" and will not be able to put it down.The quality of the writing is absolutely wonderful. This book feeds the intellect and the soul, but be warned -- if you like ""fluffy"" books and literature that is primarily plot driven, this may not be the book for you. If you can't / don't understand Faulkner, you probably won't appreciate this book either."
1,Painful.,"This book is excruciatingly painful and I finally gave up after reading about 90% of it. While I feel some sort of compulsion to finish it since I am so close, I truly cannot. The main character is this sad, pathetic person who I cannot relate to at all. The author's insistence on over-explaining every single tiny little thought, detail, you name it, muddies this book and makes me really wonder what it is about yet try as I may, I can't get through it to figure it out. Very disappointing."
3,"Beautiful Writing, Unlikeable Narrator","This book has beautiful writing, prose that I have highlighted to remember forever. It is extremely long, though, when the narrator, Evie, is a unlikeable and not a very sympathetic character. I had a hard time understanding Evie's choices and actions. I think it could use some more editing to be shorter. The beginning moved fast with the help of plot, but the last half of the book crawls."
3,So much ink to say so little,"I am ultimately frustrated at the lack of resolve; not of the characters but of the author to tighten things up and provide an anchor of linear development against which the reader could chart a sense of thought progression of the characters, and by extension, of the author herself. While being charmed by references to my own high school and college anthropology and cultural artifact, any 70s/80s website could afford that trip down memory lane. Haman would have been more compelling had she used the era as a translucent backdrop that was more interrelated to Evie's oozing angst which was about as multidimensional and unpredictable as a Bermuda handbag without the monogramming."
2,Pretentious drivel,"This is a bloated, tedious novel about a flaccid young woman who fails to mature or take any responsibility for herself as she obssesses FOR YEARS over a summer romance gone bad. She faints, cries and lapses into inexplicable comas at regular intervals, behaviors which would be better suited to a 19th century heroine whose stays were laced too tightly, rather than a so-called ""American Girl"" of the 70s and 80s. About every 25 pages or so there was a beautiful, sparkling gem of a sentence or an idea but unfortunately these treasures were buried underneath mountains of twaddle. This author has potential but she needs a strict, no-nonsense editor to take her firmly in hand."
2,"Too much, too long","I know that this novel was very well reviewed, and I can see why -- good character development, good writing. But if you are reading for pleasure / entertainment, save yourself the time / $$; it was a really long book about pretty much nothing. I kept reading to see whether or not something would actually happen to a character that I didn't really care about, and at 250 pages (halfway in), I should have realized that nothing would. Slogged through to the last page, and was disappointed by the predictable ending."
2,Very long with not much to say,"I don't shy away from actual literature - I like a complex book that makes me think. The first third of the book seemed insightful and lyrical. However, by halfway through, all of the complicated descriptions obscured plot development, and it seemed overly precious and self-indulgent. Personally, I would have enjoyed it more had it been maybe 200 pages shorter; many of the paragraphs about the color of grass or the stars could have easily been gone and not made a difference. It was like meeting someone and having them tell you interesting/sad/complex stories from their high school days. Interesting at first...but not so much after 12 hours."
2,"I could not get interested in this book, I suspect I am too old","This book had tremendous press and hype surrounding it's debut. I struggled to read this book off and on for two months but could not be interested in the main character, Eveline Auerbach. I think the voice of the book was spot on but it was simply too much and would have benefited from some editing to reduce it's length. Or perhaps if I was either ten years older (making me 49 and right at the age she was when this book was set) or twenty years younger (making me 18) I would like this book more."
3,.,The realness of the book works for and against it... It's got an authentic feeling and at times can just drag. You'll either relate to the characters or see the relation between them and people you've known and will just be annoyed by them.
3,My Bad,"I made the grave error of ordering this book off of Vine after seeing it on numerous summer reading lists. And it probably is OK--if you're of the female gender. Other than that, I personally think it was way too long and in rather desperate need of a good editing. As I was reading, I wasn't sure if it was because I'm a male that the pages seemed to get longer and longer....but now seeing other reviews, it wasn't just me. Many other reviewers also found it painfully and self indulgently long. It's difficult to say whether Eveline's experiences in the book do or do not speak to other women in the coming of age issues the book depicts. Again, I chose it and I got a book that addresses what it is like to come of age for a certain type of American female. Despite the length of the book, the writing is very good--even downright beautiful in places so whatever criticism I may have is not at the obvious literary talent of the author."
2,WAY TOO LONG!,"For every decent sentence in this book, there are another 20 sentences that could easily have been cut from the manuscript altogether. That is the biggest problem with this book...it is way too long. WAY TOO LONG!!! In fact, I am having a hard time remembering another book that is as guilty of being this unnecessarily long. This novel was originally self-published, and what I read is the alleged ""edited"" version. I have no idea what types of things the author's editor was doing all the time he or she was working on this book, but editing was certainly not among them. It's a shame, because there are definitely some good things about this book, and it would be a great and interesting story...if it was approximately 300 pages shorter. That's all."
3,Too much information,"The front cover flap basically ruins the story. Unfortunately, I didn't notice it until I was about a hundred pages in. As for the writing, if you can make it past the first two sentences, then you may be able to stomach the deluge of extraneous adjectives that follows. Example: ""Each moment that expired was a butterfly escaping, imperial in hue and color, membraneous and sheer, fluttering magically, slipping off to the gaping enormity of liberty and oblivion."" And the narrator is (as another reviewer said) humorless, as well as an obnoxious and world-weary (at 17!) brat; I recently read Sylvia Plath's ""The Bell Jar"" for the first time, and the narrator of that book, despite being a suicidal schizophrenic, is a lot more fun. Other than those things, ""Anthropology"" is an OK read."
2,Interesting begining...,"but halfway through the book I found myself incredibly bored. As soon as her 'romance' began I just lost interest. The farther I got, the less I connected with the protagonist. All of my favorite characters disappeared. I'm probably not going to finish this, especially since many of the reviewers had a similar reaction.The beginning was very good, and very interesting! The story just made less and less sense as it progressed, as far as I could tell. I was disappointed, because the beginning was really engaging!I would give this author another chance, if they came out with another book in the future. I might wait for a few critical reviews though!"
3,"I can relate, then un-relate","This book is the ""go-to"" book for me when I start talking about interesting books I read. Believe me, it was easy to put down more times then not, but also sometimes was hard to put down. To me, I felt like I had something in common with the main character and every detail was so perfect pictured, I just had to finish the book. If you are having a perfect happy life and want perfect happy books, this one isn't for you."
3,Left me exhausted,"I know Anthropology of an American Girl: A Novel has been praised in many reviews and the author Hilary Thayer Hamann has been praised for its realism and insight into the internal life of an American teenager. It is very realistic and in some places very gritty. The heroine, Eveline Auerbach, faces losses that alter her life's course and more profoundly, alter the person she is and may become. The unhappiness from these and other events are fodder for a self-dramatization and incessant turning inward, frankly, it wore me down. The writing is superb, it is as if I was listening to my own, my children's and others teen inner dialogs.......again. Maybe not enough time has passed since my own children left those teenage years, because I barely had the patience to finish this very large book."
2,v. poorly edited,"Could have been told in 300 pages. Don't be disuaded though -- there's a nice, very readable story here. Just skim heavily through the incredibly self-indulgent boring parts."
2,Waste of time,"This book was just awful. Way too long, sell-indulgent. The characters were just ludicrous. Evie never grows up! The male characters are so trite as to be laughable. The long awaited ending is flat. This is just about the worst thing I have read in years. Save your money and your time"
2,Way too long and way too dreary...,"I love big long books with a great story inside. and i hoped that this book contained one. But it didn't. Initially, I kept reading b/c I hoped it would get better. Then I realized that wasn't going to happen but I was so determined to see it through that I plodded on.It really doesn't matter what this story is about b/c regardless of that, it is a dreary story about ""an american girl"". Don't bother. Unless you have a lot of time to spend on something that you will get to the end of and wonder ""why did I do that?"""
1,Whew.......,"Whew..............I am on page 130-something, having just finished the first section called ""Opal"". Before continuing this ""slog"", I turned to the Amazon reviews, which I have never done before finishing a book. This one was recommended somewhere and I got it from the library. Shocked at the size, but - hey - I re-read ""Anna Karenina"" recently. This is no ""Anna Karenina""......it isn't even Jane Austen (as some have touted). Thanks to all of you one- and two-star reviewers for saving me from another page. For the first time in nearly ever, I'm quitting on a book I started. Usually pride myself on doing enough research that I don't get caught up in the hype.Eveline is depressing; narcissistic; cruel; very ADD; self-defeating; anorexic; drug-abusing ad nauseum. In short, much like many teen-age girls of the modern era. So what's new? I guess I would rather read a Joyce Carol Oates version of her. That one might be also be 600-pages, but it would be literate, readable, and well-edited."
2,"Too rambling, but a good idea in theory","Anthology of An American GirlAuthor: Hilary Thayer HamannPublisher: Spiegel and GrauISBN: 978-0-385-5274-9A big, way too big novel. While some of the writing is wonderful, for every great sentence there are 15 unneccessary. Predominately set in the 1970's. the author has created what could have been a moving and memorable character exploring the pitfalls of adolescense. We share her mental, physical, emotional and sexual changes sometimes in all too long and drawn out detail. That being said, an editor could have done better work in editting this and made a book and character to remember. As it was, it was just mediocre and meandering."
1,Wish I could rate this book 0 Stars,"This review is intended largely to contribute to the book's average rating--to help pull it down to 1 star where it ought to be. For a more detailed analysis I suggest seeing Eve's review on 6/8/10--her comments are very accurate with my experience.Basically, at about page 150, I started skimming 10%, reading 90%; by page 300, it was the other way around. This is so poorly written, it does little to change the common perception of self-published literature as being pointless drivel."
2,Not what I expected.,This book was not interesting to me and was slow moving. I like a little more excitement in a book.
2,Badly in need of editing,I really expected to love this book. The main character was growing up through my growing years. We seemed to have so much in common. I tried to like the book as I pondered through too many pages. But it rambled on and on and on. It could really be a good book if it were edited....tightly. I thought it would never end!
2,A Chick Book for Sure,"I just could not get into this book at all and quit reading after about 150 pages. Maby be the reader must be a woman to ""get it"", but I gave the book to a female friend to read, and she couldn't get into it either."
2,Such a sad book ...,"I'm not sure how this book can be on any good book list. The author is very creative in her writing ... to the point that she doesn't seem to make sense. There is a lot of rambling, skipping around in the time line, and apparently a lot of assumptions need to be made on the readers part. If you can get past that, then there is a lot of death, sadness, and depression. This is where I considered if I should even continue with the book. Do I want to sit through more sadness and depression, when I am pretty sure (at this point) there won't be a happy ending? Well I sat through it all ... all of Evie's weakness, thinking how sorry of a character she is for women .... and there was a happy ending. I'm just not sure it was worth it.I wouldn't recommend this book to any one. There is no lesson learned in it. There is nothing but sadness and confusion ... if that's what gets you going, then go for it."
1,A Horror Story Only If you blew 24.95,Without a doubt this is the worst book I've ever bought. It must have been written by a a kid in grammer school. The editing is awful and all the words are in capital letters. As far as the content..it's about as scary as Jack and the Beanstalk. I could write a book better than this and believe me that is bad. AND 24.95!!!!I was ripped off. I gave it one star only becaquse Amazon does'nt have a o or minus rating. Ok I've vented...don't buy this book
4,To the point,"I first started learning perl with the Camel/Llama books from O'Reilly - but did not like the style [or prehaps I lack a sense of humor?] and gave up.A 'Little Book on Perl' is just that. I skimmed over it for 30mins on the bus each morning and after 3 days felt I knew enough to throw away my awk and shell scripts and use perl in anger. This being a small book is a great advantage for someone familar with programming - you get to know the basic features of the language fast. There are however some irritations - the opening example script has typos, and some of the page numbers are incorrect - my copy has the debugger chapter included twice. Still it is the best perl book I have seen."
2,Mediocre at Best,"We are using this book in my Perl class, and the general consensus is that this book is mediocre at best. Much of this comes from the fact that we are required to do the exercises at the back of the book, which, among other things, sometimes require you know information that has not yet been covered. Also some of the chapters do a poor job at explaining things, especially the functions chapter, in which even the examples in the chapter did not work when compiled. In its defense(short as it may be), however, the fact that it is short and concise made Perl more easy to handle."
4,"Abridged, but great for newbies","These three novels by Clancy were all excellent stories. If you are a true fan of Tom Clancy, do not let these take the place of reading the novels. However, I still enjoyed listening to the abridged version after reading his novels.Those new to Tom Clancy should enjoy this series of stories, as all of them are intriguing. My introduction to Tom Clancy was through an audibook, and now I've read thousands of his printed pages. See for yourself."
5,nice baskets,"These are fairly high quality woven baskets. They seem sturdy and the weaving doesn't fray, unlike many baskets I've experienced. I use mine for storing linens, but they seem durable enough to hold heavier items & seem like they'd withstand a decent amount of wear and tear. They're very attractive and the item is true to description."
2,poor quality for the price listed,"I got these for 80% off for the price I couldn't beat it. But the quality isn't good at all, the liner is fine but the basket pieces are constantly breaking off. I wanted to use these for my 12 month old's small toys in his playroom to keep on the floor for his easy access but I have to closely supervise him to be aware of pieces coming free."
4,my first romance novel I ever read,This book was the first romance novel I ever read and I became hooked ever since. The story itself was interesting I will have to admit the middle gets particularly boring at times but it is exciting other than that. I have kept the book so I might reread my favorite parts from the book.
3,Practical content (no CD),"I have received the book within a reasonably amount of time. The content was adequate with many examples (e.g. floating point, FIR/IIR Filters, Real Time processing using DSP/BIOS.etc.), screen shots and source code, which is very helpful especially the book was purchased `used' without the CD.It'd be nice in the item description indicating that the CD is missing, so the reader is forewarned."
3,comfortable but small,"I bought this thong in two colors. The shoes are ok and really beautiful...but so small, I coudn't use it. I'm size 10 and I bought 11, and there's still small. I recomend at least, get one more size."
5,Very enjoyable.,"I love reading about the romance of the desert & its Sheikh's so much. Having been to Cairo myself, it has a magic all of its own, which this book bought back to me. They are one of my favorite types of books & this one is no different. A very enjoyable read."
5,Tender Care and Early Learning: Supporting Infants and Toddlers in Child Care Settings,"Even though it was listed as used, the book arrived looking brand new. It arrived on time and the condition is great. It was MUCH cheaper to purchase it through this web site than to have purchased it through the college book store. Thanks..."
4,Nice items,"Works great, exactly as ordered. The only thing that would be better is black screws! :) They are strong and do what they are designed to do."
2,"Interesting, but snoozer","If you like Malcolm McDowell, and love ""O Lucky Man"" you will find much of this interesting. But it quickly gets boring. It isn't paced fast enough, and much too much of this is simply reading to the camera. Instead of purchasing this, borrow it, watch it once, and when you wake up from falling asleep return it to the person who loaned it too you."
5,Osteology of Infants and Children,This is an excellent book for anybody doing archaeological osteology work in the lab or field. The illustrations are detailed and offer a good overview of bone change and growth from perinate to adolescent. Highly recommended.
3,good but not great- bad picture,"no picture. all sketeches and they arent very helpful for someone who doesnt have a lot of experience with fetal and infant bones. good for basic facts, siding, and general help, but without real photos, it just doesnt do the job in visual aid."
1,Disappointed,"I have bought a lot of exercise dvds lately. I have to say this is the biggest let down. Was expecting three high energy workouts. The first workout I only did half of the workout I got bored, and it's very low impact. Second workout you need a special ball, and the third workout is a low impact dance workout. I used to do Kimberly Spreen workouts on exercisetv and enjoyed them that's why I was so dissappointed."
4,An original poetic voice from Wyoming,"Here in Wyoming, we can tell real fast when someone gets it wrong as they try to describe the land. Laurie Kutchins has got it just right in her sensuous, clear poems of the land and love. You'll meet friends and family portrayed with honest affection and a quirky perspective. Very strong contemporary poetry, highly recommended"
2,Not her best work.,"I've been reading Drake/Graham/etc for 15 yrs. Gotta say, this was soooo boring. I could not relate to either main character since there was a definate lack of background history. Lacked ""steam"" as well, and when ""steam"" was provided it seemed to be out of context with the surroundings. I will continue to purchase her books, since this is only the 2nd book (of her's) that I have not liked, and all in all I think she is a fantastic historical romance writer."
5,"Quick, eye-opening; an intro with some meat on its bones","This was a fun book outside of my real area of expertise (if I even have one), so for it to be so readable in such a narrow field, I think, speaks volumes about the writing style.Well, narrow field, yet how many billion DNS resolutions are done, what, every day? It's nice to have an idea about how this works in some detail. Anyone with a strong computer background could read this book...knowing a little scripting would help in the later chapters, but really it is not a coding book at all. That said, it doesn't feel like a cookbook, either, although it is, in fact, a little more along those lines...but the author does a great job at presenting DNS itself and not just Server 2003 administration."
5,A must for Laurel and Hardy fans,"If you love Laurel and Hardy like our family does this is a must to have. The quality of the films are fantastic and the sound is great. I really like how it comes in book style and it tells a little something about each film. I am so glad that they have the Spanish versions too as we lived in Spain for many years where my son fell in love with Laurel and Hardy. He was so glad to see the Spanish versions once again which by the way are their real voices, yes they really learned the lines in Spanish.Thanks so much for this wonderful collection, we couldn't be happier with it. I give this collection 5 stars and if I could I would give it 10."
5,Happy L & H fan,Oh wow! This is so great to get this wonderful set. I actually think the book format packaging is very cool. I watched these movies on TV as a boy. Their comedy is a standard far above the junk we see now in movies and TV. I want to have a Laurel and Hardy marathon.
3,"nice collection, but...","Have always been a L & H fan for many years and so I purchased this collection because it is great to have all of these shorts and special films in one collection. However, I have a big problem with the quality of the videos. The manufacturer claims that all the shorts have been digitally restored but I find most of the shorts I have viewed so far to be in lousy shape. They are full of scratches and white spots and terrible contrast. I have copies of some of these, I made from TV on a VCR twenty years ago that look better than these shorts. I am astounded at the reviews that state the films have never looked better. I really was expecting a lot more - visually speaking."
2,This is America,I am very upset that there are several Spanish Laurel and Hardy movies in here. If they were made at the time of the originals that's fine. If they are recent than this is my last purchase from you. Illegal aliens cost the citizens of the United State ove 300 billion dollars a year. My grandparents were imigrants but they came over legally and did not go on welfare. When is this going to stop!
3,Nice Selection but Odd Omissions,"It is hard to imagine what the ""ssential"" Laurel and Hardy Collection should have in it - or for that matter who should decide what should be in it! It would have been nice to have ""The Complete Works of Laurel and Hardy"". It is something of a surprise not to find films like Babes in Toyland, Bonnie Scotland, The Devil's Brother and Flying Deuces among the missing. While one can argue over whether these are ""essential"" or not, certainly Babes in Toyland must be one of their best known."
4,IT COULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT-CHECK OUT B&N'S PRICE!!,"I can't help feeling that the exclusion of silent classics like Big Business and Two Tars and the inclusion of Spanish language duplicates and unneeded features (I don't need other people telling me they're great) took this from a perfect (5 Star) compilation of the best of Laurel and Hardy to a very good (4 Star) collection of their talkies.A special thanks to other posters who pointed out that Barnes and Noble have this item for $30.00 less, $59.95!!!"
5,best in laughs,"This is a must have 4 any 1 who calls themselves a laurel&hardy fan! Also a great set 2add 2 yur must c comedies.plays great &has great 2 reelers from L&H,real comedic geniuses!"
5,Humor of yesteryear,This takes us back to the 20's and 30's--the clothes--the people-- the culture! The humor is not that of today but we can stand amazed at the amount of work and planning that went into each episode. These clowns represent charactures that reside within us and the consistency of the characterizations through the years is wonderful. some of the episodes are ingenious in catching that slapsticdk humor.
4,Disc 2,"There is a problem with Disc 2, when I click on the film ""Another Fine Mess"". The film ""Below Zero"" plays instead."
3,NOT THE COMPLETE COLLECTION BY FAR,My Laurel and Hardy collection contains 40 dvds. Everything that was available on dvd and video (which I transferred to dvd).Have all the features that they appeared in either together or seperately.Numerous shorts-both sound and silent- of them together or seperately and many before they became a team. Over 100 of their shorts and features in total.The only ones that I don't have are the lost films and any discovered in the past year that have yet to appear on dvd.It is essential for any L&H buff that they have the early silent shorts BEFORE they were a team . It is ludicrous in having their films in your collection if you don't have the silents.I have a silent film that they were both in but had yet to be teamed together. What I would like is for the films to emerge on Bluray in order to cut down on my massive 40 dvd collection.
3,"Classic comedy; lousy, cheap packaging","I bought even though other reviews were negative on the packaging. When I received the collection, the first thing I did was place each disc in its own jewel case, keeping the documentation separate. No way I was going to remove and replace discs from and into those cheap paper sleeves. I could have done without the different languages--I can't believe people who only speak Spanish or French would buy this set for the few episodes that were presented in their language--kind of silly."
3,Laurel & Hardy: The Essential Collection,"This product has lots of the laurel and hardy classics, but it does leave out some of the laurel and hardy silent,s the collection also has many of the film's in duplicate in Spanish which I don't see what the necessity for that is. The seller will not do any refunds or returns."
1,Closed Caption,I am very disappointment no closed caption or subtitles on this. I love Laurel & Hardy. I hope this make subtitles and closed caption sooner....
2,Beware with the case.,"Despite the announcement of the HD restoration of the wonderful ultra classics, by the photos the sleeve cardboard case of the discs seems be terribly cheap and are not plastic slim cases. It's a big disappointment because it is clear that inevitably will scratch the discs badly with the use. I wanted to buy but I will not do it. You are warned."
1,"great compilation, terrible restoration job!","okay, what exactly in this collection was digitally restored and remastered????? if this is all that remains of these short films, then I understand the poor image quality. However, none of the visual defects were digitally cleaned up! throughout the films were tears, heavy scratches, missing frames, huge dirt chunks, dirt showers, huge frame jumps and sprocket damage. the packaging was handsomely done which leads me to believe that this is where most of the money went in to and not to actual restoration! .....and what's with some of the episodes being in Spanish?? I don't see the purpose in this other than to fill space. it's nice to see the boys in all their glory finally, but the restoration job in this collection is awful!"
5,GREAT SET!!! PACKAGING TOO!!!,"Overdue and finally here!!! What a great set!!! Don't listen to the whiners that complain about the set. The amount of films you get for less than $70.And the packaging is nice. An outside slip case, with a book (outer hard cover) and accordion type pages that the discs slip into.There is a forward, plus run times and a lengthy synopsis for each film.GREAT JOB RHI!!!"
4,Great! But...,"I like the collection very much. Hours and hours of belly laughs. I own most of these on VHS but having them on DVD is wonderful. My only peeve is that the silent ""Big Business"" is not included in the collection. The confrontation between Finlayson and Stan and Ollie is one of the boy's all time great conflicts. I have a VHS copy but it is without a music sound track. Sure would've appreciated having a re-mastered copy with a score."
2,"remastered, not restored","Having taped the Hal Roach Specials last year on TCM, I was very disappointed with this set. What is being advertised as restored seems to be nothing more than remastered. The picture on most of the shorts still shakes and moves. Editing marks, splices, edits, dirt, etc are still there. Actually, the prints from TCM are in better shape than this. I love the films, but this collection will not replace what I taped off of TCM. The same is true for the Little Rascals shorts. If you want to see restored and not just remastered, compare these shorts and films to what SONY did with the Stooges shorts. I was expecting Laurel and Hardy to come close to that restoration. Very disappointed...Very!!!"
2,"Classic Films, Terrible Packaging","This set includes some of the best Laurel & Hardy films ever made. I was excited about this set until I received it. The packaging is horrible (similar to a lot of those ridiculous Rhino CD & DVD sets). This set comes in a book-style case. Each disc is stored in a cardboard pocket which makes it impossible not to scratch or get fingerprints on the discs. The best thing to do with this set is to take all of the discs out and store them in separate DVD cases so that you can at least watch them without ruining the discs. What a shame, this could have been the perfect Laurel & Hardy collection."
5,This is the definitive Stones book!,"Just got my copy & it's wonderful. It's huge. Great photos, alot of text and creative layout of pages. Bill Wyman certainly made good use of his time away from the Stones. This book is a must for all Stones fans."
5,You'll Love It,"This book by ex-Stones bassist Bill Wyman and Richard Havers is one of the best rock books ever; it's also the most definitive Rolling Stones book. This is the second book by Wyman,his first being 1990's ""Stone Alone"". This book has everything Stones- tour setlists, photos, information on singles, and clippings from newspaper articles. It even tells the real title and the story behind the infamous groupie anthem ""Star Star"". It also features a hilarious 1970 Peanuts comic advertising the release of ""Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out"". The photos here are amazing. But there's one fact I can't believe. Who would vote Keith the 9th handsomest man in the world? Ray Charles? This is great bookfor any Stones fan."
2,Silver polish,"Seller was good with delivery time and condition of package, but the product itself is a joke. They advertise it as a one step miracle cleaner for tarnish and all things silver, but in actual use it does very little. So much so, that we thought we used it incorrectly and started all over again following the very meager directions to the letter. This product IN NO WAY measures up to silver polish, a clean cloth and lots of elbow grease. In fact, what it's really good for is once you've killed yourself with polish and a cloth, this gets out some of the grime in the impossible to reach places; sort of ""gilding the lily""."
1,Ripe off,This product is such a joke. Nothing works on this product or should I say the joke was on me.
1,WARNING: Not the original text,"This edition of Rebecca of the Brick House is not the original text as written by Kate Douglas Wiggin. It is ""Rewritten and re-told for today's reader"" according to the cover, which is very difficult to see on the image here at Amazon. (If you click on it to get a bigger image, you can make it out.) It is also not described as such in the text here. Make sure that this is what you want before you buy. I don't see that the original text is in print anywhere, though."
2,lots of static,I bought these as a cheap and temporary solution to replace my broken speakers until I get a new computer. These speakers are cheap and sound like it. Bad static and sound quality.
4,"too much static sound, although good enough for price PAIID!","Although hey sell as Altec Lansing, they are branded DELL.The sound is OK but they keep too much static sound when at idle.Could be just fix a better arrange of the cables and other power lines for the PC system.Otherwise, good product for the much spent.Good budget speakers !"
5,"Oldies, BUT goodies!","I bought these about a year ago, and had another pair years before that. I recently needed another set of computer speakers, BUT I couldn't locate these anymore?If you just need GOOD stereo sound, these speakers work GREAT! IF you can still find them."
4,Great value,These speakers deliver good sound. I use them all day on Skype for my business. Compact with good range and volume.
2,Great stories; mediocre reading,"While the stories on the Jungle Book are true classics, this Audio Book version is a disappointment: while the readings are clear, they are dull and listless. A work like the Jungle Book deserves a better performance."
5,Great DVD!,This is what any disgaea fan would want to watch it's great and the voice acters fromthe game are the same as the ones in the game all but enta she got a differnt one but still sounds great
1,Play phone,The product I received is nothing like the picture! The phone I received looks like something you would pick up in the checkout line of the local discount store! Worked long enough for my son to tear it out of the package and carry it to the trash can!
3,"Slow, but promising","When I saw the adds for this anime, it looked like a good hit! I never heard anything like it before and it sounded like it could be good. When i finally got it and watched the first episode, i was pretty disapointed. Dont get me wrong, it was bpretty good, but it just wasnt AS GOOD as I expected.After about a week, i got the courage to watch the other episodes on the DVD, and i was much impressed on how it picked up. While still not up to my expectations, the series got better with every episodes and i dared to preorder the next volume just to see what is goin to happen.Check this out if you have the money to do so, it definetly shows promise."
2,Sloppy anime,"I purchased this anime on the word of a friend. I regret this purchase very much. The animations are half decent. That is the only partially redeeming part of this DVD. The story lacks imagination, the characters are annoying and predictable, the dialogue is bland and tedious, and the nudity has no point. It has no part in the story at all. At one point a pilot just walks up to an android a pulls of her shirt. It did not even build his character because he was not even a main character. The main character is a whining brat. Five minutes into the film you wish he were dead. The action scenes were repetitive, dull, and predictable. I know this review is nothing but one huge complaint. People must be warned though. This is quite possibly the worst anime I have ever seen."
1,Totally hopeless and meaningless anime.,"I enjoy good anime (InuYasha, Bebop, Gundam Wing, X, FMP, and many others) but Blue Gender lacks so much. The characters are somewhat lame and pointless and the plot is just really bad. Its like starship troopers gone anime with the creators having a concussion while doing the story. The animation is good but thats it."
3,Those crazy Japanese anime guys...,"They have done it again. Not only do you get a gratingly annoying lead character who does nothing more than whine throughout this whole DVD, but you also have the (dis)pleasure of seeing giant alien bugs with especially sexual mouths that resemble the female nether-region. Try watching this one for more than two minutes without wanting to smack the TV and/or go watch some porn. Other than that, it can be pretty good."
2,Annoyingly average,"This was a disappointment.The aliens have taken over the Earth, and what's left of mankind lives in space orbit, making occasional forrays to Earth to begin its reclamation.The aliens and mecha are nothing special (the mecha remind me of good old Votoms), and the animation is lackluster.But the killer is the ""hero"", a timecapsule survivor who is so busy emoting his horror at discovering Earth was trashed that all he does is scream loudly and annoyingly (in your choice of languages) with wide eyes through the whole three episodes. After awhile you just have to hit the STOP button to be rid of it.The plot may have promise, but I'm not planning to put up with any more screaming to find out."
5,This book is a MUST HAVE,"Fabulous, fabulous book. Really well done. This one book will save people tens of thousands who own a small or home-based business. Great information on Fringe benefit, real estate and small business. I loved the discussion on deducting my golf and fun....I can't recommend this book highly enough.I also love the writing style by Mr. Botkin. I never thought a tax book could be humerous as well.Get this book and as Mr. Botkin so well noted, "" Make your life less taxing."""
2,slides over important (and expensive) points,"I have 2 small businesses. I own rental property and work freelance. I'm also a professor, so I receive a pay check.This book slides over some important and expensive details. For instance, it barely mentions that a home office must be used exclusively for you business. According to the tax man, it cannot be the guest room, too. And the author suggests setting up a trust to protect assests, without discussing the cost (not small) of that. These are just examples. Since there are problems with the information I have experience with, I wonder if the information I'm ignorant about is correct."
5,The only Tax Strategy Planning book you will need!,"Sandy has finally done it! This is the only simple and easy to understand Tax Strategy Planning book in America. Sandy has taken a very dry subject and brought it to life in a way that teaches and entertains at the same time. Sandy also backs up all of his strategies with laws, court cases, IRS rulling, etc. This is a must read for ANYONE who is a business owner, self-employed, sub contractor, home based business owner etc. We feel that this information is so vital that we give this book to all of our clients. Sandy is helping Americans keep more of what they make, and teaching people to use the strategies of the rich. I recommend this book to anyone who is a business owner."
2,Interesting but unrealistic,"This book has good information but not really very usefull unless you really have a homebased business and even then it is still very tricky. I mean, yes you can do what he's telling you in the book, but no as easy as you'd think.Rob"
3,Of limited value,"This book is well written, but the message it contains is not applicable to everyone. If you're a regular salaried employee and not in a position to set up your own home-based business, it won't be of any use to you"
5,"EXCELLENT! THIS IS NOW MY ""TAX-BIBLE""!","THIS BOOK IS LIKE HAVING A PRIVATE CONSULTATION WITH THE IRS REGARDING HOW TO LEGALLY AVOID PAYING MOST INCOME TAXES! SANDY TEACHES YOU ALL THE TRICKS OF HIS FORMER TRADE AS A TOP IRS ATTORNEY!THIS GUY IS REALLY GOOD! GET HIS BOOK AND SAVE YOURSELF TONS OF HARD-EARNED CASH!INDEED, WHY SEND ALL OF YOUR MONEY TO IRAQ?! THIS BOOK WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO KEEP MOST OF IT FROM THE IRS!"
1,Good Doorstop,"As a former tax professional, I found Mr. Botkin's book to be worthless. It can be used as a doorstop however."
3,Helping book,For those who need help with lowering your taxes. I purchased this thinking it was more for an employed person but its actually more focused on helping lower your taxes if you own a business.
3,Not as useful as I thought,"This book concentrates a lot on deductions you can make if you own a business. While there is a lot of useful information (and all legal if you keep abundant records), I was expecting more creative ways to lower taxable income."
2,2004 Edition received,"First, the book was received later than indicated; however, the seller sent me an email to let me know that he was expediting a second copy to me at his expense because UPS had mangled the first shipment and notified him of such. So, kudos to the sellerI was disappointed in that the book I received was for the 2004 year (probably explains why the price was lower than others). However, I still found it to be helpful, but will need to consult a later edition for changes in the last 4-5 years."
1,little guy disaster,This book is geared to business people and not for the average individual. A lot of the tax saving strategies are fantasy too!!!!
3,"Good first CD version, but eclipsed by Kondrashin","Stankovsky's Slovak taping was the first CD issued of this marvellous work. Whilst the performance is quite dedicated, it simply doesn't have the drive and passion of the 1959 version recorded in Moscow by the late Kiril Kondrashin. The latter must, despite moderate sound, be the yardstick. Stankovsky does however bring some individuality to the second movement in particular and the quality of the playing is generally good, if hardly in the luxury class. The recording is similarly acceptable but somewhat close and rough-edged compared with the best. Ultimately, the disk lacks something in atmosphere compared with Kondrashin or Veronika Dudurova's more idiosyncratic reading."
5,City boys with the mountain sound,"The Country Gentlemen came from around Washington, D.C. but did their best to copy old 78 acetates of mountain music...they succeeded. I bought the album to get the song ""Lord Don't Leave Me Here"" one of the greatest a Capella gospel songs I have ever heard...enjoyed the rest of the album also!"
4,Six Sigma Handbook,This book is very well written with lots of easy to reference/find topics. Actually I was expecting a much smaller (less content) book for the price. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a handy Six Sigma reference!
4,Good book for beginners,"Well this is a good book for beginners and covers a good amount of quality tools. Its written in simple language and easy to comprehend. I would recommend to any beginner to read. As one has commented this would not give detail explanation on the tools, so keep that in mind."
5,Lean Six Sigma Pocket Toolbook,"This is a really good consolidation of the various methods available for approaching six sigma projects. It is an interesting book to browse and very useful if one is unsure about exactly which methodology or statistical test should be used in a given situation. Six sigma is mostly about applying a scientific methodology to improving processes and this book ""cuts to the chase""."
1,Price?,How come the Kindle version is more expensive than the paper one? It does not make sense Amazon!!!
4,Great reference tool,This is a great reference tool book! Ideal for intermediate level 6 sigma users. Easy to use and easy to understand.
5,Ideal Summary,"This is a Tool book, covering all of the essential tools required by Lean Manufacturing, Quality and Six Sigma practitioners. The authors pack maximum information into a trim 276 page pocket guide. The information is presented in a logical sequence, with a reasonable amount of context and application hints. The various statistical and process tools are covered. This is a well-written reference book for those who have learned the materials previously. It is not an introduction, history, study guide or textbook.Highlights include chapter 9 on Reducing Lead Time and Non-Value Added Costs, the Kaizen quick improvement outline (p. 20), the Kano customer satisfaction grid (p. 64), the measurement selection matrix (p. 74), guidance on selecting a control chart (p. 123) and matrix plots for multiple regression (p. 171). If you're a quality/operations professional, this should be on your bookshelf."
4,Very handy book,"This is a very handy reference. I like to use it for quick references during projects etc. I also very much recommend the bookLean Six Sigma That Works: A Powerful Action Plan for Dramatically Improving Quality, Increasing Speed, And Reducing Waste."
2,Fails to be a good reference,"Although content wise most is covered, typography, introductions and summaries give a messy impression and frustrates when trying to find the essence. For example the book's index simply sums up where the keywords you're looking for are found (Little's Law: 9, 202, 213), leaving the reader guessing on which page to find what he or she is looking for. Lacks statistical background info and does not cover data transformations for non-normally distributed data."
5,Ken & Barbie -- back again,"Silkstone dolls are based on the original Barbie face with the tiny puckered lips, peaked eyebrows, and side glancing eyes. This Ken could retro fit the original, except that he is not vinyl.I like the dress with Barbie written very modishing all over, and love the tux. As a couple they've been together through good & bad years and years and years! Don't we all wish we could ~age~ so gracefully.Silkies are not meant for children to play with, but they are sturdy enough to do so if the child is old enought to not bite the fingers, pull out the arms, or cut off heads.Both of these are classics. I have a lot of the couple sets, and find each charming in its own way.Mine is still in the box, but it has a place of honor. Since I now enjoying making clothes for dolls, these are bound to have a few new outfits soon.Gold label dolls are limited editions; playline dolls for children are everywhere."
3,way over priced even at original retail,the 45 anniversary items were all way overproduced and this set did not sell well even at original retail. Ken doll looks like a corpse and Barbie looks like a transvestite. I guess they just did not hold Robert up to his usual design standards here.you can get the prettier blonde Barbie version in the same dress for much less . I hope Mattel won't churn out 50th anniversary items at too great a rate and flood the market next year!
4,A Laugh-out-loud Caper,Donald Westlake is a master of the absurd and unpredictable. His caper novels pack more hilarious twists and turns with every page. Expect to laugh out loud several times during this book!
1,The lamest caper novel I've ever read,"I can't even bring myself to spend much time critiquing this novel. I teach 5th grade, and nearly all my students could have come up with more sensible, more credible, more imaginative plans than Dortmunder does. Not only do they fail, they fail to inspire the imagination. A very boring, plodding novel. I got my copy from the library, but am taking the time to write this so no one else wastes their time, or money."
5,Excellent Product,This DVD is everything it claims to be and I was very happy with the product. As a larger lady I have always wanted to do Yoga and this DVD makes it possible. The Yoga teacher is clear consise and very good.
4,Very Comfortable!,"I've tried a couple of different yoga programs, but my weight would start to hurt me after a while.This was the most comfortable yoga workout I've ever done. I've got rolls....did you know you can just move them out of the way? Most of the time I tried to pretend they weren't there. And standing hip-width apart......as my hips got bigger, did that mean so did my stance? Abby helps the rest of be able to have a relaxing wonderful workout just the way we are.My legs have never been so stretched out before. And I didn't know how to use the yoga products (like the block or the strap) before I did these.I highly recommend this DVD, especially if you are a newbie.The only complaint I have is that sometimes she doesn't explain the modifications until you do the second side....and it sometimes would be helpful to hear it the first time."
2,Basically Unusable,"I am not in the greatest shape- which is why I got this DVD, but if you are in any kind of shape most likely this DVD will be way too slow paced for you. I felt no difficultly when doing most of the workouts, also there was a lot of talking. Too much for my liking. I would not recommend this product to anyone I know."
2,Little disappointed,"The contents and materials are not exactly what I've been looking for from this book. It seems a bit out-dated, especially in this fast-evolving digial age."
5,fantastic,"everything was great, product in good condition, arrived in good time period. book was correct according to description, looking forward to using amazon again in the future."
5,The True Dharma Eye,"I LOVE this book!! Every read puts a smile on my face. Sometimes I laugh out loud, mainly at myself. This books opens the mind to new ways of thinking and is beautifully written. You can feel the mind being stretched like a rubber band."
5,WONDERFUL,"WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK, RICH IN HISTORY AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF PITTSBURGH HISTORY. EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT FROM THE PITTSBURGH AREA, AND YOU LOVE TROLLEYS, YOU SHOULD PICK UP THIS BOOK, THE PICTURES ALONE ARE WORTH BUYING THE BOOK. I ALSO KNOW THAT THE AUTHER IS PLANNING ON COMING OUT WITH A SERIES OF 3 BOOKS ALL ABOUT THE TROLLEY LINE IN THE PITTSBURGH AREA, AND IF THEY ARE ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE THE ""MCKEESPORT TROLLEYS"" I WILL DEFINATLY BUY THEM. MR. BEAL HAS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB AND I CAN NOT WAIT FOR HIS NEW BOOKS."
4,nice cleanser,this is a very nice cleanser - i thought that it would remove blackheads but it hasn't so far - so that is a little disappointing. but overall i really like it and woudl purchase it again.
5,Terrific,"I have several recordings of the Schnittke Cello Sonata including the BIS one. I find this one the most satisfactory. Despite the somewhat snotty tone of the Gramaphone review, Schnittke is to me a truly fascinating composer (perhaps that is why I find Gramaphone reviews are generally to be ignored). Schnittke was clearly influenced by Hindemith and at least here he has produced a gem of the cello literature."
5,"Great Bag, Beautyfull","Fits perfect for my HDX16-1370US and also for a Toshiba E205. i like the ""E"" logo on the strap. amazon doesn't mention that there are two hidden pockets in the bag, they are great!.Recommended"
4,"nice stickers, but expensive",I splurged and got these stickers for the cub scout scrapbook project. One sheet of embosed sticker (what you see) is all you get for just under $10.
2,"Not their best, but there's some traditional L.& H fun.","One of Laurel & Hardy's last films has the boys caught in a political-intrigue story which could have been funnier. This film has its moments for L & H fans (our heroes cater a disastrous dinner party for nervous hostess Mary Boland; a well-photographed climax finds Stan and Ollie on a window ledge), but try not to pay too much attention to the boy-king-versus-assassins plot."
3,Nothing that bad,"You read the reviews about this movie and you think it's just plain awful. In actuality the movie isn't terribly funny but aside from that it's not that bad a film. A decent plot and a decent script...just not the kind of a script that Laurel and Hardy should've gotten. There are brief funny moments in the film but not enough. Again, the film isn't terrible but it's just not something I'm used to seeing from this legendary comedy team. Overall not a bad flick to watch with the family."
3,not one of their best,"this is one of the last films that laurel and hardy did and it makes me sad to give my favorite comedic duo only 3 stars.the thing i hate with their movies,as well as abbott and costello's,are that theres not enough of them in it.we always have to suffer through other peoples bad acting and bad singing,all of which always hamper how good these films deserved to be.of course this doesn't overshadow the comedic genius of laurel and hardy.this film is worthy for at least 2 scenes that i can think of.one is they forget to buy a steak for the dinner that they are making for their rich employer and instead decide to try to steal one from a lion.the other would have to be laurel and hardy trying to cut the steak that hardy just cooked.funny stuff indeed but these two deserved so much better."
2,Not the Real Laurel & Hardy But Passable '40s Comedy,"Near the end of their very disappointing sojourn with the big studios, the team survived another marginal film offering a distorted view of the original characters. However, this time around, Stan and Babe fight the crooks on behalf of a child King, well played by David Leland. It's probably their most sentimental movie but it is not cloying - the good scenes involving a sleight of hand removal of meat from a lion's cage and serving a meal to Mary Boland & company elevate this effort to above average for their later work."
2,Nothing But Mediocre,"After a promising start, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's 1944 effort plunges into a sea of MGM mediocrity with a ludicrous plot involving the attempted murder of a boy king. However, Chef Ollie's ""Steak a la Oliver"" is worth a few laughs."
1,A real shame,"Despite the odd funny scene, this film leaves a sad feeling as L & H really dont look like they belong in this film. There are a few jokes that are worth seeing, but dont see this until you have watched all their Hal Roach films and are desperate to see more L & H material."
3,I think this is a great little picture,"Lots of people knock the 1940s Laurel & Hardy movies, but I happen to think this is a very enjoyable little picture. I watched it again last night and chuckled throughout. L&H are a little older here, and the comedy isn't quite as raucus, but that may not necessarily be a bad thing for all tastes. I think the plot is sentimental, but heartwarming, and it keeps things interesting. All the comedy scenes are quite funny, and Mary Boland is hilarious. I certainly would recommend this movie for family viewing, and kids are sure to like it."
3,Speaker grill cloth?,"First of all I wouldn't consider the material to be cloth. It feels more like a plastic.I like the look of the material, but didn't like the texture of it. It is to stiff and doesn't lay flat when wrapped around the back board. It wants to puff up.I probably wouldn't purchase it again."
2,not as good as the original,"This is not written by Kate Wiggin, but by Eric Wiggin. ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" is a charming fresh story, with the same sort of flavor as ""Anne of Green Gables."" Book 3 is more like a Victorian ""improving"" tale, with plenty of scripture thrown in. It's as if the author, a minister, wanted to tame the original Rebecca (whom he would not have liked if he had met her) and turn her into a good Christian wife.The characters are one-dimensional and the writing is banal. The author kills off one of Rebecca's brothers in one chapter, and then totally ignores it in the next chapter, which is cheerful and lighthearted. The characters' feelings just aren't real."
2,"disappointed, disappointed, disappointed!","I thought this book was going to be eye-opening to things that I knew I would never try. Instead the author spent more time discussing (or boring us with) her opinion on the subject matters then actual time being involved in the events. If I had known that it was a book of opinions I would have never purchased it. Everyone has an opinion on these subjects, we wanted to know what it was like to experience them."
1,Pass the salt,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I found the recording of these so-called adventures irritatingly tedious and trite. The author never quite manages to find a pulse in any of her subjects."
1,A disappointment,"I was given this book as a gift, so I forced myself through it, but found nothing of what the title or the author suggested. Tongue First is really more like Tongue Last (or Tongue Not At All) as the author's experience of these areas is such a banal and empty one. She writes well, but this is more like a college thesis, obediently written, but there is no vision, interesting insight, or anything really new to say. The only times the book comes alive is through the tone of the writing, and when it does so, it is young and fresh, rather MTV-like. I had to wonder, why was this book published? Myabe when the author is older (has lived more?) she will write something better."
2,Title Misleading,"I was given this book as a gift, and so I read the whole thing. From beginning to end I found no ""tongue"", no ""soul"", nothing to do with the real experience it claims to represent. I felt as if I were reading a college thesis, correctly and obediently written, but empty. No imagination or what they call ""writer's vision"". It was like something you'd find in a dentist's office, along with the Reader's Digests, etc. Why was this published as a book? Maybe the author will write a better book when she's older?"
2,Been there done that,It started off okay. Heroine never did that. I couldn't wait to see what else she was going to try. Much to my dismay I had done most everything she described. I am only 27 years old. I feel so bad for her if the experiences she talks about are really major tests or adventures. I can tell you that she really wasn't taking any chances here. I thought maybe there would be more experimental behaviors rather than tested and true life experiences that most of us have. Don't buy it and don't read it. And for goodness sakes if you liked this book please get out of that chair and experience life!!!
2,Big problems with read errors,"For perfect DVDs, this drive is fast and smooth. However, when it encounters a bad block on a DVD, it spends over a minute fiddling with itself trying to read that precious block. Meanwhile, the movie is frozen. This makes it almost unusable for DVD playback. I broke a brand new Incredibles DVD from its case, and that played perfectly. But any DVD that has the slightest imperfection is a problem.I haven't tested the recording capability. I was hoping to buy only 1 drive for both playback and recording. This one doesn't fit the bill."
2,Buyer beware,This drive worked nice for a year. Then 16 days after the warrenty is up it died.The laser no longer reads the dvd. Tried all types of dvd's and cords even differentcomputers and nothing. Electronics arn't built to last anymore there just built cheap!
1,unreliable junk,stopped working after 1 monthstarts burning dvd and never finishes;some dvds which it finished writing are not readable later on
3,Cute little table book,A very small little book. Great for the table for people to peruse. Its a bit like a brochure on coffee and the East India Company. Not to be mistaken for a reference book.
3,"They are not great, but O.K.","I never had anything like that. They shift. This is ""winter"" in the South and they are already hot. Remains to be seen what happens in summer with heat and humidity. We'll see. All in all they are doing the job but I am not thrilled.Sorry."
1,Wimpy,"These are flimsy, thin and didn't serve their purpose of concealing ""nipplage"" . And they were overpriced for the quality."
1,bra inserts not well made,"These are not worth the money they're not formed well they're not thick, You would have to triple them 4 to make a good fit and actually increase bust size. Don't buy!"
3,Not what I expected,"It felt just a little short on substance with a lot of ""get in touch with your feelings."" Not the help I hoped to receive."
5,Great book,"Breathing Life Into Your Characters is an excellent book. It helped me create characters that were flawed human beings not cardboard cutouts. Rachel Ballon knows her stuff. Her writing is conversational and personal, as if she is talking to the reader. Instead of offering paint by number instructions as some other writing books do, she asks the reader to look inside themselves to summon the characters within. This book really helped me."
2,Disappointing,"I expected a lot from Dr. Ballon's book because of all the rave reviews at the time, but the book turned out to be a huge disappointment. There are way too many repetitions. The exercises are all the same and too predictable. More importantly, they were not useful, and I agree with the reviewer who mentioned they might even be dangerous for some individuals without professional supervision.If you've already read other books on characterization, don't expect to find anything groundbreaking in this one. This book didn't offer anything new or even practical for developing fictional characters. I cannot recommend it."
5,Making characters come alive.,Wow! After reading Dr. Rachel Ballon's insightful book writers will discover a myriad of three dimensional characters waiting to burst out of them onto the page. Dr. Ballon takes the reader through a unique journey of self-discovery in a book I highly recommend to writers of all descriptions.
5,I loved it.,"Some of the preceding reviews bash on this book for its simplicity or repetition, but in it I found a lot of advice that I didn't realize I needed desperately. My story and characters are a hundred times more clear now.This book will help you see your characters as people and make them infinitely more interesting. It will also help open your eyes to the characters living around you every day. I checked it out from the local library, renewed it, and was about to renew it again when I realized ""I am going to be using this book for years. I should have it on my bookshelf.""In other words, buy it now."
4,Developing Authentic Fictional Characters,"Rachel Ballon, PH.D. helps the writer create convincing characters with step by step instructions for developing psychological profiles, using non verbal communication through practical exercises and by exploring their own knowledge and feelings, memories, backstory, passions, and emotions.I found the suggested exercises in the chapter ""coping with conflict"" especially practical and helpful. The material on dialogue, lasting impression, body language, is invaluable.""Breathing Life into Your Characters: How to give Your Characters Emotional & Psychological Depth"" is an important resource for the library of every writer at any level, novice or professional."
3,"It's pretty good, but.................","This is a solid fairway wood. It's not the best I've played, but it is solid. I have a T-zoid FW 3 wood that I don't play anymore and mp-001 feels a lot better than it. I think this could be a very very long club, but I traded it within 2 weeks for a V-steel. The v-steel is more forgiving for me, and that may be why I didn't like this club. It just went cold on me really fast. I hit it well for a few days, and then every time I tried to hit it, it didn't work. Shank city. My buddy had a v-steel that he let me hit along with the mp-001, and I was hitting good balls with the v-steel. Maybe it was mental, but I just didn't have a good experience with this club. Sorry Mizuno...your woods don't work for me, but I do LOVE YOUR IRONS!!"
4,I enjoyed this book,"While the naysayers (meaning MDs) do not like chiropractors, it seems that it's not because of science or philosophy, it's because of money. This book tells an interesting story of how the chiropractic profession started, and how it grew into an empire that made the AMA run scared. Their only ultimatum was to try and destroy chiropractic. However, as this books point out, that didn't happen because chiropractic has done the job in most cases, and many people have stopped going to their medical doctors and are now going to chiropractors. As can be witnessed today, and you'll see this in the book, many MDs are still against chiropractic, even though they know nothing about the philosophy. This book details the entire story of the fight to keep chiropractic accessible to everyone, despite the fight from the other side"
2,FLYING SWORDS OF DRAGON GATE,"The DVD was a fine movie; though 1/2 to 3/4 way into the movie the frames would 'freeze', then blank but after a minute it would continue and I was able to view the end of the movie. I have most of JET LI's movies- some I purchased from Amazon and they play well on my DVD machine."
5,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate,Really enjoyed it. I have never seen a Jet Li film that I did'nt like. This movie was very well executed.
2,"Good action, but too long and a confusing plot",There was a good bit of fantasy martial arts action but it took too long to develop the plot and story line. It was just toooooo long between action scenes and confusing.
5,FANTASTIC,This is a wonderful epic. There's super action sequences that only Tsui Hark can direct and there's a superb fight sequence inside a tornado that's one of a kind. If you're a fan of Asian actioners you'll love this
2,another crappy movie,"Not that great of a movie,acting is horrible, story isn't that great. Don't waste your money. I hope tai chi zero is good, becuz this movie and assassins are horrible. Also I couldn't wait to see man with iron fists,and I heard that is really bad. Hey what's going on ? make some good kung fu flix! Also now I hear no kill bill 3? I'm so upset. Wah!"
3,Too much money for speedy subtitles,My friend brought it at Walmart with English words dubbed in. I had to read subtitles that scrolled too fast.I also paid more than my friend payed bout $2.00 more.
1,CGI was weak!!!,"this movie was rediculous, the story was horrible and the outlandish scenes were a major turnoff, jet li need to get back to reality like in lethal weapon"
5,Outstanding match and quality,"Bought this to cover a very complicated 1/2"" MDF box with shelves and doors. The product is very durable. I had to use numerous blades for my utility knife just to cut it to fit. The carpet is very low and tight pile just as you would find in a solarium or floor mats in a vehicle. I would highly recommend this product."
3,127 Hours,"I remembered hearing about this incident and about a month or so ago watched the special segment (either 48 hours or 20/20) and was perplexed by Aron's account of what he experienced. The segment talked about the entire incident and took you back (on a factual basis) of what happened.The movie was OK and while I knew it was not a documentary, it dragged on and on. Perhaps, I was spoiled by hearing the ""live details."" Anyway, the movie is entertaining but misses out of some key elements such as the toil Aron had to endure during the 127 hours, as well as the 4 hour trek to get back to civility.....once he decided to cut off his arm."
5,Moving and Inspiring,Didn't really know what this one was about going in and was very impressed. Great story and the acting was really good too. This movie makes you want to work harder at whatever it is you are struggling with.
2,Booooooriiiiing,I turned this movie off half way through. I was bored to tears with this drawn out story. Gave it two stars because the acting was good
1,Movie Idea,I got my finger stuck in a bagel for 27 hours and had to cut it off and didn't get a movie out of it.
1,Fell Short,"Boring and confusing. The book is phenomenal, but the movie fell short. Even having read the book I was confused by the movie. At times it was hard to know what the flashbacks were referring to. I recommend reading the book or getting the book on tape to get a great account if the story. I normally dislike book on tape but this one kept my attention."
2,A movie like this should make the viewer feel trapped,"I never felt that way. I love Danny Boyle but this movie was terrible. Maybe I have to rewatch it a few times. I did think The Beach was terrible the first time I watched it, along with 28 Days Later. Honestly, this movie disappointed me. Maybe James Franco was a bad choice to play Aron Ralston. I felt like I was in the cave a half hour. Honestly, this was a lazy effort. If someone expected Danny Boyle to work a miracle with this movie and make it entertaining, they should get their money back. There was absolutely no creativity. No one will remember this movie in 3 years. His mother was looking for him. The girls were sort of expecting him. Why not interject the movie with some flashback scenes, to take the viewer out of the cave, then interject them back into it, for emotional purposes?I'm offended that this was nominated for any award."
1,127 Hours should be charged with Armed Robbery.......,"....for stealing two hours of your life.Yes, the movie is great at showing the power of the human spirit and the will to survive and all that stuff good. But to draw it out for two hours when Oprah could have made a better version in 15 minutes for her show or perhaps a Discovery channel show on Camping Disasters would have been better suited.Its not that the movies is that bad (decent acting, cinematography etc....). Its just long, drawn out and super boring. Almost as boring as the horrendous Social Network.Maybe we should just all wait for the sequel 127 Days and see a Hollywood version of the video footage he took of his kid being born.Thats all about Hollywood can come up with these days when they aren't ripping off the rest of the world for original content."
4,127 Hours,I was really looking forward to watching this movie and it did not disappoint. James Franco holds this film together wonderfully.
5,Art,"This film is a piece of art. Moving, gorgeous, heart wrenching, riveting. It's one of the very few times I've sat in a theater after a film and thought ""that was a work of art."""
3,"Just OK compared to ""Touching the Void""","This movie is just so-so. Franco's acting seems flat given what his character endures - I'm pretty sure I've expressed more pain and aggravation after stubbing my toe. And Boyl's use of split screens, flashbacks, and a jarring, self- conscious soundtrack never let me feel like I was really there. In 130 minute film with little plot, really identifying with the character and losing yourself in his situation is what it's all about. Otherwise, a couple of hours is a long time to stare at some guy trapped by a boulder.For real life, edge-of-your-seat thrills in the wilderness, I suggest ""Touching the Void,"" which is engrossing - and often exhilarating - from start to finish."
3,Overwhelmingly mediocre,"I generally do not enjoy Danny Boyle movies as I find he tries a little too hard to be ""hip"" or ""cool"". When other directors can do it by trying new things and experimenting, Boyle's style comes off as underwhelming and stale, and this movie was really no different. I don't know what I was expecting. What I was really impressed with in this movie was James Franco's performance, which kind of reminds me of an up and coming Johnny Depp. Although I believe we will see him in more comedy oriented movies in the future, he can certainly pull off the dramatic rolls pretty well. The story is interesting but didn't really offer up anything that couldn't have been accomplished in a short documentary or recreation type program. If you enjoy Boyle's style I would recommend this movie, if you were unimpressed by slumdog, I don't think you will find too much to like in this."
2,Read the book,Much of the story never gets told. The book provides the details that make the story much more real. The movie also adds some parts to the story line that just didn't happen. After you read the book you'll realize how poorly the movie captures the essence of Ralston's adventures.
3,It's what you pay!,"It's pretty much an average DVD, but it looks used. It's not bad, but don't give it as a gift!"
4,Great Movie limited by the Source Material,"The movie was done very well, with beautiful cinematography and great acting. However, it is a very limited story, which causes it to be relatively boring. Besides Franco, the actors with the most face time are probably the ants. There just isn't enough meat on the bone. While this may have harmed the integrity of the movie, I would have preferred longer more in-depth flash backs or maybe more time at the beginning of the movie to get to know the main and only character. They do achieve their goal though, and triumphant ending of him cutting his arm off and being helicoptered to safety were very strong. I admit I had a tear in my eye when the credits rolled. So, I don't advise buying this movie, but it is a great rental if you don't mind the slowness and slight gore at the end."
2,Would Prefer a Good Documentary,"For me, this story could've told in 30 minutes. I'm going to watch a good documentary with the actual person -- Aron Ralston, and will likely find that much better. I did not care for the flashbacks and the visual thoughts of the character in the movie, it just made it more drawn out and boring for me."
1,Maybe I should of tried...,"This movie, to me, was about as exciting as watching grass grow. I rate it as equal as' Cast away', boring. The movie trailers looked interesting, but I guess don't judge a book by it's cover."
2,Drawn Out,"Watch the Documentary. Its more emotional, and informational. I was BORED watching this movie. Fell asleep, and never did finish it. I guess I didnt enjoy this because I knew the story."
2,90 min of agony,I'm not sure why this movie got such high reviews. I watched it with my girlfriend the other night and neither of us enjoyed it. The story line was adventure combined with an acid trip. I would skip this one.
2,Very well done... but dissapointing.,"I'm going to go ahead and say it, there just isn't enough here to fill the short 90 minute run time.There is so little plot, that half of the movie is filled with ill-fitting memories and dream sequences. The dream sequences are very haunting and well done. Especially the imagery of the dark figure, the protagonist on the outside looking in... But it became tedious rather quickly.Danny Boyle did great, I don't think anyone could have done it better... And I still think this is a good movie and agree with the positives by early reviewers. Would have made an incredibly compelling short. But you can't fill seats with shorts.... Worth a watch. But be sure not to bring one, or you'll end up checking it frequently."
5,"So good from the very beginning, to the very end!","I have passed on watching this movie a few times, I didn't think it would be something I would like, being a middle aged woman, and not real out doorsie... :) But I checked it out at the library and I was spellbound right from the very beginning... It was so intense in parts that it was almost hard for me to watch... And because it is the true story of Aron Ralston's and I had known about him, it was even more touching... James Franco is phenomenal in this movie!!.. I was so taken by this movie, that after I watched the movie I purchased a DVD for my son and after researching Aron Ralston I even purchased Aron Ralston's book ""Between A Rock And A Hard Place"" for my son... So glad I did!"
3,OK,"To me, this movie was just OK. It was well made, but after about 20 minus, it quickly lost my interest. There just wasn't much of a story or character development. Afterwards I thought--there's a reason why Hollywood never made movies like this 50 years ago--who would see it? I wish I hadn't seen it. Slumdog Millionaire was 10x better than this movie."
5,Amazing Survival Story!,Not sure I would be able to do what this brave fellow did. A 127 Hours of human survival at it's best!
4,:),"Great movie, amazing true story, but I had to look away due to some scenes because of my weak stomach (not going to ruin movie)."
5,A Simple But Powerful Story Of Survival,"First off, I really get into these types of stories like you see in Animal Planet's ""I Shouldn't Be Alive"" where a person or group of people is placed in a seemingly impossible situation to get out of, and have to somehow survive. 127 Hours is exactly this type of story and really delivers a power that will make you squirm. Not a film you are likely to forget right away! By the way, James Franco was terrific as pretty much the only character in the movie - a very tough role to play.I've seen a lot of movies that go overboard with some complex and heavy-handed storyline where you just get lost amidst all the details, and it just becomes tedious. 127 Hours just goes to show that you can tell a gripping and effective story without all the bells and whistles. Instead, we just have here a simple story of survival, and that can sometimes make for a more entertaining experience. Sometimes less is more."
3,good,"127 hours is very slow.james franco is ok,but lets face it he is no tom hanks,and he certainly did not deserve his oscar nomination for best actor.i do not like the director who also directed 2008's much over blown slumdog millionaire(which i hated)"
4,127 hours is good but please release sweet hostage,im a big movie buff i must of seen a million movies. my favorite is sweet hostage. 127 hours was interesting but sweet hostage is much better. i own sweet hostage on vhs and transfered it to dvd. if sweet hostage ever made it to dvd it will be one of the best sellers. everyone i show sweet hostage to says its the best movie they ever saw.
3,True story....,This is a true story and it is very interesting....but it kinda dragged a bit. Lots of cursing because the guy was in so much pain....but for me I don't really care for cursing. Just my opinion....hope it helps.
4,Nice for the Price,"I got the Hyacinths. I wanted some plants that floated for my fake Amazonian biotope fish tank. These seemed to fit the bill. They are obviously fake of course; you get 6 in a package and not just 1, which is nice. My complaint is that the very low movement from the filter causes these to turn on their side several times a day, which kind of defeats the look I was going for. Since there isn't a way to position the plastic, I haven't found a way to get them to stay upright through a whole day."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this product for my daughter's science fair project. When it arrived, we found that it was plastic! I can't believe it. We needed duckweed that would actually grow. I gave it two stars because it might to useful for some types of pets, but this product description is very misleading."
1,PLASTIC,I looked up live plants for aquariums and this is what I got. PLASTIC PLANTS...needless to say I threw them away and bought some locally.
1,Ad should be modified,This ad does not state these are plastic plants. It really should as it appears I am not the only person who made this mistake. If the picture showed the plant in the packaging that would be enough to get the point across. This is really deceiving if you are looking for a live plants. I recently bought 6 plants and if I can't return them I will be throwing them out. What a waste.
4,great book for the road warrior,"extremely helpful for those arriving at new places around the world which are new turf. Latest edition needs better updating. I bought it thinking that the verson from a couple years back would be updated, but the updating is somewhat limited. Still an excellent resource for both the domestic and world traveller."
2,Not for beginners,"This book was disappointing. I am new to JSPs. This book does not explain any basics of JSPs and Servlets. It straight away jumps into JSTL. After reading a few chapters I didnt have a clue as to what was going on. It does not explain anything about using MVC. There is no exercise at the end of any chapter so you cannot quiz yourself to see if you have understood everything or not. Also the author keeps saying ""I will explain this in later chapters"".Then I bought Head First Servels and JSP. Trust me this is the book that you want if you are a beginner. This will build a solid foundation of your understanding of the whole web based Java programming.Also notice how many people wrote review for this book versus reviews of Head First. You can tell lot many people bought Head First and more people have given excellent reviews of it."
2,JavaServer POages OReilly - book review,Seller was great but this is 1 of the OReilly books that's to wordy and has mistakes in the examples. I would not recommend.
2,Horribly disorganized,"O'Reilly falls down on its usual excellent editorial job and delivers an undisciplined unstructured mess that is useless as a reference. The JSTL examples are so incomplete as to be virtually worthless. As an experienced developer, I spent my 45 bucks expecting a useful reference and practical guide, instead getting a beginner's tour and some appendices of jstl syntax spec."
2,"Good content, but bad organization","I started reading ""JavaServer Pages, 3rd Edition"" hoping to get a good grasp of JSP.After 3 days I was wondering why I was still confused about JSP.Then I started reading the JSP chapter in ""Java Servlet Programming, 2nd Edition by Jason Hunter"" and suddenly everything made sense. I am *much* more comfortable with the coverage of JSP in ""Java Servlet Programming, 2nd Edition"". The JSP chapter in ""Java Servlet Programming, 2nd Edition"" is much more logically organized, and easy to follow.""JavaServer Pages, 3rd Edition"" may have all the correct information, but I found the organization of the book to be confusing."
1,Bad,"$20 for this was $19.99 to much! I was surprised to open the box and see the product was a scrawny teeny tiny little tree with teeny tiny little lights, sitting atop a huge base that took huge batteries. Back it went and it probably wasn't worth the postage to return it.. but it was that bad.."
3,They are a very small #9.5 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The shoes look ok, but they are small and narrow, they are not a real # 9.5, they are smaller than that. I'm making an effort wearing them. They look to me, like a future gift for somebody with smaller feet than me.Regards !!Juan Carlos"
5,Excellent UV light,"I have an oil leak from the rear of my vintage Datsun's engine, which annoyingly remains even after changing the rear seal and oil pan gasket. So I put in a 1 oz bottle of Tracerline dye and drove around the neighborhood.Armed with this powerful light and yellow glasses the leaks appear like trails of glowing orange paint off the rear of my bellhousing. I can even see areas around the oil pan where there is no leak, but enough of the dye wick'd through to show, as well as a trace on the front balancer seal. Neat.To save money I had tried using a cheap black light bulb but saw nothing. So I bought this inexpensive light which is worth every penny. I can't wait to pull the trans and flywheel to see where the oil is really coming from.UPDATE: My rear seal and oil pan were fine and dry, the leak was coming from the oil gallery plug. I replaced it with a 1/4"" NPT and thread sealer and its now tight as a drum."
5,Looking From a New Perspective,"Roger Parker's book helped me to re-focus on the web as simply a new technology tool. Proven and tested marketing principles need to be applied to this new tool in a way that attracts repeat customers to our websites and make them our advocates. With succinct and useful steps, Parker leads the reader to develop this ""relationship cycle"" by providing meaningful content that assures successful business. A great resource and highly recommended!"
5,MUST HAVE FOR BASKETBALL,"This is a great product. It is light weight, so it doesn't feel like you are wearing anything. I have used it about 2 times since I received it form AMAZON. Let me tell you, I have been taking it to the hole a lot more aggressively. I have been hit about 4 times pretty hard in the kidney area and lower chest. I know it was hard because it sort of knocked the wind out of me, but i didn't feel it... so the product was working. You won't notice it underneath your basketball top and I like that aspect of it. The only thing that i noticed was that it would slide up about and 1 inch every so often, so i would have to pull down and adjust it just a bit. But its no big deal. If you dont have this. BUY IT."
5,Great,this is a must have for basketball players! i see why 95% of NBA players wear Mcdavid stuff. its comfortable and keeps you dry and protected. wish i could find more in my size for a great deal
4,Works OK for some martial arts as well,"I bought this to give me some additional protection while sparring in Kenpo Karate, without the bulk of the traditional martial arts chest protectors. It works pretty well too, but the lack of padding over the center of the chest/solar plexus means it's not quite ideal. It would be great if they made some models with more over-all protection, but I don't fault this shirt since I knew where the padding was when I got it."
3,Averagely entertaining,"This held my interest sufficiently to finish the book in one day. The characters didn't particularly endear me (though Fluer and Robert were sweet if not very typical characters), the plot was okay as was the writing. I didn't find the dark hero all that dark or intense, I couldn't really feel the conflict within him in relation to Jessamine. Overall okay book. For Anne Stuart works that I loved with dark heroes that fit the role, try Moonrise and Ice Storm."
1,Not Recommended,"This book was required for my graduate class in Knowledge Management. Before this I had a vague concept of what KM was about. So this review is from a beginners perspective.The book is difficult to read at best. All concepts are abstract with very few examples or applications in the real world. Even the diagrams are confusing. For example Firestone and McElroy propose a different model from the data-information pyramid called the Knowledge Life Cycle (KLC). The arguments make sense but instead of the diagram showing what the KLC consists of, it includes the KLC as a process. So you are left scratching your head.A better book is ""The Knowledge Management Toolkit"" by Amrit Tiwana. It at least presents many examples and gives an approach in building a KMS."
1,"CAUTION - History Student, not a real history book.","I find most of the Idiot books pretty good. Not really for idiots - just easy, fun, quick reads that lay down a good foundation on the subject. The book is for idiots. Duncan writes well enough, but most of what she writes is of little value to a college history student - or anyone wanting to learn real history. Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, Chuck Berry all get more coverage than Fredrick Douglas. Ida Wells gets a paragraph while Shirley Chisolm gets almost two full pages. Oprah Winfry gets more coverage than the 54th Massachusetts. Much of the book is a long attack on the South, as if no discrimination existed in the North. Ducan has a political agenda as well and it is decidedly left wing. Duncan is not a historian - but a businessperson and it shows. Idiots Guide publishers - please get historians to write the history books."
3,"Good Advice,Questionable Haiku","The book offers plenty of helpful information about the nature of haiku and how to write it. However, the author's examples--with very few exceptions, all her own haiku--usually do not conform to the canons of mainstream haiku. Her haiku are often very subjective in tone and abstract rather than concrete. The examples are misleading to the novice and troubling to the haiku practitioner."
1,beginners - beware,"How did this book get published?ISBN is not an acronym for ""International System Book Number"". ISBN stands for ""International Standard Book Number"".The haiku in the ""simile"" section is a ""metaphor"".The format for rengay is wrong.And if you are a beginner, you had better like Reichhold's haiku because you won't find any other authors in the book."
3,good with inaccuracies,"The trouble with a handbook is that the unaware reader will assume that the writer of the handbook can't be wrong. ms. reichhold is wrong about a lot. she didn't get the scheme right for the 2 poet rengay which is a real mistake. there are confusions between metaphor and simile (simile uses ""like"") and it is confusing taht in her own haiku, ms. reichhold doesnt seem to know the difference. also, all of the haiku samples were written by her which i never saw before in any other haiku book. this is not a good book for a new haiku hobbyist. it might be good for a grad school course in proofreading a writing textbook with inaccuracies."
3,Scholarly study,"This is a fascinating scholarly study of the life of Chinese immigrants living in New York City in the early 1900s. However, it falls short in reporting the circumstances surrounding the ""trunk mystery"" death. The sparse details of the murder threaded thoughout the book left me wanting to know more. The book was published in 2005. Since then, extensive on-line newspaper accounts have become available detailing the murder investigation. Read the book for its sociological insights. Don't read it expecting a thrilling murder tale."
1,lazy and lame book,"i ordered this, based largely on the concept, which seemed like a book on gay history that was much needed to fill in the gaps. instead, the book comes off as if Kaiser got a nice advance and then needed to submit *some* kind of manuscript, but he had lots of other things to do, so he did the absolute minimal amount of new research. instead, he relies heavily on taped interviews with 6 or 7 gay men to fill out the pages. The chapter on the '70s, one of the most important decades in gay history, has nothing more than former bartenders saying that ""the Mineshaft was wild, man"" and a politico friend of his talking about how he semi-came out of the closet. No sense of the ""gay metropolis"" here, just a random series of unconnected anecdotes. I hope he got a nice advance, but this book isn't really worth actually BUYING - just check it out at the library, in all its dismalness, and see for yourself."
3,Book lacks interviews with people of color,"As a gay Puerto Rican who grew up in Manhattan, I find it disturbing that Kaiser manages to interview dozens of gay New Yorkers -- almost all of whom are white -- without really presenting the experiences of gay New Yorkers of color. In the interviews themselves, many of the white gay New Yorkers talk about how the influx of Puerto Ricans in the 50s and 60s changed the city, about the similarities between modern black drag queens and white drag queens in the 50s and 60s, and about having black boyfriends in an era where this was extremely dangerous -- even in New York. But he never manages to find out what it was like for gay people of color before the 70s, something I think is terribly important and, alas, remains unexplored. His book is fascinating and provocative in other ways, but without covering the full richness of the gay New York experience, the book falls short and Kaiser misses an opportunity to further illuminate and innovate."
1,Major Disappointment,"This book is everything I hoped it would NOT be. I second the emotion on snobbish and name-dropping, but the vilest criticism is that Kaiser is so uncritical of anything the gay community has done, continues to do in destroying itself from within, and ventures nowhere in the future. Kaiser is so 'proud' that what he has produced is one of the most skewed pieces of propagandistic writing in the last 50 years and far from what I would call analytical historical writing. Considering the length of this book, the tragedy is what it could have been with a more objective outlook."
2,mediocre and derivative,"I am surprised none of your reviewers have made the comparison with Chauncey's pioneering Gay New York. Though Kaiser deals with the period after Chauncey's book he has learnt nothing about historical analysis from his predecessor, and written a book which is snobbish, name-dropping and adds virtually nothing to the already existing litertature"
2,Not very insightful,"While I applaud an effort to make a book on Leadership, this one misses the mark. The first half the book is a complete snooze...there is nothing ""actionable"" that you can take away from this book and actually put into practice. It reads like a first year college Business Management paper."
4,So far so Good,"I haven't finished the book yet, but it does look to create a new way of looking at leadership. Be a leader inside, and then it will show outside. Not much new here, but a lot of incredible research and interesting methods."
5,Outstanding book for current or aspiring leaders,"If you've been told or believe you can't become an exceptional leader, and would like to get insight on how to achieve this, then this book is for you.The book The Extraordinary Leader: Turning Good Managers into Great Leaders provides an inspirational view on leadership based on facts and research - not unnecessarily complex theories, models, and boring anecdotes. In fact, the revelations in this book are based on research data gathered on over 25,000 leaders from more than 200,000 questionnaires.After reading this book, you'll be inspired and also questioning yourself and your career. But I believe that's precisely what we need to effectively move forward in life.If you'd like to learn more about this book before jumping into it, then feel free to read through my personal commentary: [...]"
5,Packed With Knowledge!,"In this volume, two battle-scarred veterans of what might be called ""The Leadership Wars"" - that is, the exhaustive effort over several decades to define the elusive nature of leadership and how it can best be nurtured - present insights on leadership that are based on a series of formal surveys conducted with companies nationwide. They also present 16 core competencies that affect the perception of whether you are, or aren't, a great leader. In many ways, they demystify leadership. Being a great leader, they tell us, isn't a matter of genetics or tea leaves: by studying what it takes to be a great leader, you can become one yourself. We strongly recommend this book for followers who want to become leaders, and for leaders who would like to be a little less lonely at the top."
4,If You Liked the First One...,"...then you'll like the second one. It's pretty much that simple.The second volume of ""Someday's Dreamers"" doesn't really mess with the show's formula, and that should be just fine with fans of the series. The cuteness is still out in force, as are the relatively episodic plot lines. However, in the last episode or two here we meet a young man named Inoue, who sees himself as unable to do anything right, including magic. It is he who plants the first seeds of true self-doubt in Yume's heart, and that line of the story will power the last several episodes of the series.Although I feel like I ought to post something longer, the review here can be summed up as: If you enjoyed the first disc, you'll find more of the same here. If you didn't, well...you'll find more of the same here.~"
2,Reflective? Really?,"I put 2 long stripes of this on my rear bumper, and there is zero reflectiveness. The black tape applies nicely and looks sharp, but is seemingly for pin-striping appearances only. This thin 1/8 inch black seems to have nil reflective worth.I read the warning about black being the ""least reflective"" of their colors. But if they're going to sell it as such, it ought to shine just a tad, don't you think?"
2,Waste of Money..,"I should have passed on this one... The acting was bad, it had a good story line but the actors were not believable at all."
3,"Received fast, but broken","I received this product pretty quickly, but when I received it, the case of the ""brick"" was not holding together correctly. I am too busy to go through returning it, though, since it's the only power supply to my computer I have right now..."
1,VERY STALE!,"This came in fast, but they were extremely stale! They even had that white look over the chocolate that indicates staleness. This company has quite some nerve selling these candies like this!"
4,"A bit stale, but still good","These definitely aren't as fresh as you can get them, and I probably wouldn't order again, but for the money it wasn't a bad deal and I'm not throwing any of them out."
5,Buy this film!,Great photography. Touching storyline. when have you ever watched a documentary 5 times and still found it equally exhilarating and interesting? It is just a great film.
5,A beautiful piece of videography,"I bought this video after seeing the preview on the website and I wasn't disappointed. I must say I hadn't realised it was an expose of Van Nuys Airport however there's enough info of a general nature to make it appeal to all. What was really impressive was the cinematography that takes you on a journey of aircraft and flying from angles never seen before. To sit just off the tail of a DC3 on landing was just wonderful. The music takes you away also. If you're a plane buff and especially a pilot, this is a must see."
1,Don't try your computer,since my TV DVD player wasn't currently hooked up to my new HDTV I put the movie in my computer's DVD player. It seems to have ruined it. I later hooked up my TV movie DVD player and it keeps saying bad disk.I guess I'll have to order another 16R video if I want to watch it.
4,General Aviation,"Very interesting to watch, remember and enjoy. I learned abit of flight simulator flying in and out of Meigs Field, Chicago. Mayor Dailey stopped the real thing when in the dead of Night he had a crew to dig up the runway. What a loss."
5,Wow,"Whether you're a pilot or not, this is an important work. Airports are the life blood of many small communities. They are precious resources and are not fully appreciated by many. Since the dawn of mankind, we have watched the birds and wanted to fly. Now that we can, we need to guard this wonderful freedom in every way we can. Please go to your local airport and just watch the planes. Take your kids to see the planes fly and infect them with the fever and excitement that flying can bring to us.Pilots are a special breed, they are friendly, easy to talk to, and can add a whole new dimension to our lives, if we let them. I have been a licensed pilot for over 35 years and it has been an honour to help general aviation succeed. This is a wonderful movie. Enjoy!Neil McTierBC, Canada"
1,I guess it would have been good....,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my aviation-loving father. I wouldn't play and displayed ""bad disk"". We exchanged it and the same thing happened even though he tried it on several players. I guess the DVD would have been good if he could actually watch it. I was disappointed."
4,For Aviation Enthusiasts,"If you're an aviation enthusiast. Pilot, Student pilot, Aviation mechanic, Aeronautical engineer or just a person that has a passion for aviation in some way..........You will enjoy & get something out of this movie. It's a good insight on General Aviation & how important it is to keep & maintain General Aviation. Just about all of us aviation enthusiasts started out in General Aviation. The movie is an excellent presentation of aviation in the real world."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the video based upon the title, ""One Six Right - The Romance of Flying"", and the reviews on this site. Don't get me wrong, it is well photographed and scored, BUT I was expecting more ""Romance of Flying"". As others have written, it is a history of Van Nuys airport that happens to have a few great flying scenes. I was looking for a video that really did portray the passion of pilots, especially the Private Pilot. This video is not it.Rent it...don't spend the $ ... unless you are really interested in that airport..."
2,"Beautiful Aerial Footage, but Way Too Achingly Sentimental","If you like gorgeous air-to-air airplane photography, look no further. It's here. But if you want a movie to capably introduce the general public to general aviation, this is not the one to pick. Rich men's toys, the glistening corporate jets and multi-million dollar WW II aircraft, is not what the heart of flying is about. Cute children looking longingly through an airport fence does not persuade non-flying residents living next to or under airport noise. Yes, I am biased, but biased in favor of private flying, as I am a licensed pilot myself. I know of and respect many of the people interviewed on camera. But this production is too schmaltzy to be an effective documentary. Save your money: instead, pay a little more and give your teenager, or your neighbor, an introductory flight lesson."
2,High expectations not met,"Most people who buy a movie like this are pilots or aviation-types of some sort and already know that small airports are in trouble (not that this movie was about what most would call a small airport) so it was pointless for this film to beat that dead horse.I also don't know how this was shot, film or digital, but my DVD had the worst interlacing I've ever seen on a commercially produced video.Oh yeah-- they could have sprung for a little more variety in music. The same piano riff over and over and over and over and over was too much for me.Many of the interviews with the older pilots were a delight, but this wasn't nearly enough to overcome the movie's shortcomings."
4,One Six Right,"Great documentary about an airport I and many others grew up with. I moved to the valley in 1949 with my parents and remember when a lot of the valley was all dirt. One of the people in One Six Right is our neighbor, Pete Regina."
3,from 1993 not 2008 - Wish it had weights,This is a good beginner video. I was expecting some of the newer workouts I've seen recently on TV that include weights. This is a good aerobic workout and will enjoy doing it during my lunch breaks since the sessions are only 20 mins long.
5,Anxious to try the DVD,"Wore my Gilad VCR tape out in the 90's..... glad to see DVD's are available. Loved his workouts then, and am anticipating the same opinion now as I transition from gym workouts to home workouts!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,Not only is this an extremely old video but it appears they simply gathered various people right off the beach (still in their bikinis!) to participate. Poorly done. Not his usual style.
5,Love this dvd-love gilad's workouts,"If you want a fast workout that gets your heartrate up and gets you moving, Gilad is great. This dvd is with people right near the beach at Waikiki working out and having fun doing it.The seller sent the dvd very quickly, and I appreciate the service. I would buy from this seller again anytime. Thanks again."
4,"Love you, Gilad!","After a few years without Gilad, I am so happy to be back with his Jumping Jacks and ankles to the bottom. He's a very good instructor. Love this!"
5,gilad bodies in motion,"I have been along time fan of Gilad, he inspires with knowledge and personality. He explains all the time the correct way to do each exercise and he is good to look at!!"
3,very good but short,I have many gilad videos and this one is my least favorite because the work outs are very short. three episodes of 20 mins each. you have to go through all of them to get a reasonable workout. each segment is only 5 mins
4,"Great read, glosses over detail","I have to agree with other reviewers. The math is dead simple. And the transition from batch to flow will re-invent your business.Where to book fell down for me was in the examples given. If i worked in a shop which only produced a small list of parts and very little process variation i would be done implementing by now.Where a small business may fall most large facilities/organizations do not. Again, great way to approach changing the way your business runs but without some serious data mining and statistical skills you will end up right where you started."
1,Humidor = Cloves,"The one star rating (which should be zero) is just for the product, not the vendor. The item was sent promptly and well packed. If you think of a ""humidor"" fragrance as fresh cigars, wood (perhaps cedar) and moist air then you and I don't share the same definition as Demeter. There is only one note in this fragrance, super strong CLOVES. That is it, just overpowering clove smell. There is no way you would use this as a cologne or room spray."
1,"Humidor, really?","Very very light scent that smells like nothing but cloves. Should be sprayed on ham, not the body, am very disappointed."
5,"""He had less kinky hair.""","Honestly. ""Kinky hair"" says it all. I recommend this book for whenever there's a dull moment--in the car, on a plane, during a class lecture when the teacher isn't looking.Not that I did that, of course.""Hidden Magic"" will delight anyone who likes light romance, good ol' clean magical fun, and the occasional tongue twister."
5,delightful,I like twists on the traditional Prince and Princess Charming fairy tales. Loved the ending. Won't spoil it though.
4,Oat Milk Mask,"I like this mask, it really exfoliates and smooths out your skin, reducing dry skin and pimples. My face has a tender, silky smooth texture after I use this at night; it lasts well into the next day. Just keep up your face care regimen to maintain results."
3,Not for beginners!,"Well I am totally new to music and guitars. The dvd said it was for beginners....well maybe beginners who already know alot. I am going to put it on the shelf until I learn a bit more somewhere else. Also, the camera angles make it hard to see the instructor's finger placement."
2,Wasn't very excited after listening to this album,"I bought the album for the ""Girls on Bikes"" song. It was nice to be able to hear the song, but the rest of the tracks were unappealing. If you are thinking about purchasing this album, keep in mind that ""Girls on Bikes"" is the exception to the album, not the rule."
2,"Graphics are horrible, just ok fun","My kids played with this twice. They couldn't get past the absolutely horrible graphics. It looks like it was produced on a Commodore 64. It doesn't really respond well to the player either. I'm glad I didn't pay much for this, but it's just been collecting dust since Xmas."
4,Kinematic Chains and Machine Components Design [Hardcover],It is a good book. I'm hapy that I have that book in my book self from now.I am interested in this area field of engineering and I will try to buy more such a books.
3,Esperaba un poco más,Pues esperaba un poco más de desarrollo temático en el concierto para violín! La calidad de la grabación está bien!
3,Epic score but this recording lacks something,"Epic, profound pathos and grand. It is the New World Symphony and the soundtrack of Gone With the Wind meets in China.The music so appealed to me I bought two CDs, they differ primarily by the selection of companion tracks. Both my CDs are Naxos recordings, the first being subtitled ""Romantic Violin Concertos"", then I got one which is labeled ""Marco Polo"". I recommend the ""Romantic Violin Concerto"" recording as I found the main track to be far more appealing. In addition a greater reason that I like the ""Romantic Violin Concerto"" CD is that the companion tracks are so much better than the ""Marco Polo"" selection."
5,the music and story that make me cry,"I grew up with this story in Taiwan(from movies). I was stunned when I fisrt heard of this music at 17.The music is very sad. With image of the movies, which were made about 25 years ago in Taiwan and about 5 years ago in Hong Kong, I cry each time I listen to the music. It's classical and yet composed with a provincial accent.It's sad to say but the composers seem unknown compared to Romantic composers such as Dvorak, and Tchaikovsky.There are several different versions available in Taiwan, I don't know about here in the states. Some are played with tradition Chinese instrument- 2 HU(don't know what the name is in english, it sounds like violin but the key is lower, it plays a very sad sound by nature).Wish I could give this CD more than 5 stars."
4,A very penetrating study,"Whomever you are, if you ever tried to love Jesus as the Christ, and found yourself wanting to look harder at what really happened on Calvary in order to love Him better, you will enjoy this book. This book writes from a Catholic perspective in that it will reference the Catholic Sacraments, and recall them with love in the voice of the text, but it does not really try to convert anyone to this faith any more that anyone describing their wife wants to convince you to marry her. Perfect for Lent or similar need. I think that a grieving soul would also enjoy this book. Enjoy!"
3,Eye-opening... historically fascinating....but.....,"The book has a great story to tell... but, I wish Ms. Carrell had written it more clearly..I find myself jumping around, skipping boring, antiquated writing passages to get to the real historic juice of this story.I know Ms. Carrell is a scholar, but I think even scholars can (and have) written passionate books without sinking in to intellectual drudgery.This book plods along.. I want to know things.. and I have to wade through a lot of rhetoric to get there.I will get to the end of this book.. but, I wish the author had written it without the 18th century drudgery. Wow, this book is hard to get through.. But, I am hungry for the info.. so, I'll carry on."
4,Smallpox: a history of inoculation,"It's early in the 18th century, and smallpox epidemics are raging. Inoculation is viewed as quackery, a folk remedy used only in Africa and the Far East, but two brave mavericks, one in London and one in Boston, defy the elitist views of physicians of the era and commit themselves to the cause of inoculation as a defense against the scourge."
2,Enjoyed what I could.,"I downloaded the sample to my Kindle. The first quarter of the sample is the intro. etc. I found the rest of it very interesting and would have loved to finish the book, however I refuse to pay full price for a Kindle edition when the hard copy is a bargain book!"
4,Bringing to light the story behind variolation for smallpox,"This is a fictionalized account of smallpox in England and in Boston in the early 18th century. While many people are familiar with the story of Jenner and vaccination against smallpox using the cowpox virus, fewer people are aware of the process of variolation, which used small amount of smallpox to give the recipients a milder case which protected them from the disease. This was practiced in Africa, Turkey and the far east and was ""rediscovered"" and brought into practice by two brave people, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, a survivor of this terrible disease. and Zabdiel Boylston, a doctor in Boston. Each took much risk to spearhead the use of this practice, and in some ways, suffered for their beliefs. The author has done an enormous amount of research into smallpox and the history of variolation and does a nice job of building a full story about each side rather than just a recitation of the facts."
1,nun plus,"The problem with this book is one is either Catholic or not.If one is, you know all these very very long arguments.If one isn't,he could care less. Kienzle hides his motivesfor updating the Churchunder the guise of a mystery."
5,Fun & informative read!,"Charles Wilkins does a great job in tackling the people, landmarks & history of Thunder Bay, ON, largest community on Lake Superior.Of particular interest are the chapters based upon the historic Finnish community, the center of which is the fabulous Labour Temple housing the famous Hoito ... the best place in town to eat, soak up history and even learn a new language."
4,"Good, but better story collections out there","One or two were amazing, and most were good, but I wasn't crazy about the somewhat snotty (""we're all so well-read and a good STORY doesn't matter"") attitude of the editor, which showed through in the selection."
4,Forget the Celestine Prophesy. This is the real thing!,"At last! A ""new age"" ""alternative"" ""spiritual"" fictional thriller/action title written with sparkle and genuine excitement. This scores not just in the content, but also in style! The story is great and the writing intelligent and thoughtful. I would recommend this to any spiritual thrill seekers who have a sneaking admiration for Schwarzenegger in Total Recall. By the way, buy it quick coz it has been discontinued in a number of places around the world"
2,"Not bad for a first novel, but I had hoped for better","Starhawk is a wonderful expository prose writer, so I thought she would be an excellent writer of novels. The novel is interesting, but it reads like a first effort. The novel is well worth reading, but I hope Starhawk's style gets better as she becomes more proficient."
5,"Thought-provoking, beautiful, sensual","I was initially a little wary of this book -- I was afraid that it might just be cheesy New Age nonsense. But I was wrong. I TOTALLY ENJOYED IT! I didn't want it to end! It describes 2 possible paths US society might take : one of domination and violence, the other of equality and respect. I liked that even in the ideal world there are conflicts of interest and arguments, but people are committed to working through them and talking them out. So nothing's ""too"" perfect; rather, it is a possible world, truly something that we can believe in and work toward. Wonderful, spirit-moving, thought-provoking work. Heightened my sensory experience of the world and made me appreciate everything around us."
5,"Powerful, magical, mystical book","This is an absolutely fabulous book that opened my eyes up to new possibilities. With each reading, I am just as excited about it as previous readings. it is very powerful and thoughtful."
5,Amazing! The type of Book that makes you think!,"Starhawk takes us to a place that may not be too far off in the future. The setting is brilliantly written, and the characters come to life and jump out at the reader. The author makes us think about where we are and where we are going. Also shows us what community concensus building is all about."
5,Damn good,"This book is great. Not just a story of fiction, but an emotional, spiritual journey, full of lessons to learn.So good... you should really read it. It's delightful."
5,Great Book!,"This is one of my absolute favorite books. It has adventure, a deep plot, and at points requires you to reflect on your own actions."
5,Well-Loved Read,"I don't remember the first time I read this book. And I don't know how many times I've read it since that first time. I just know I love this book and wish there were a sequel or even more to the story. But without that, the hope that is engendered in this story is greatly needed now, when everything seems to be falling apart and lacking hope. The world Starhawk has created is too close to us now, but as long as we can imagine a better world, we can create it...which is what she has done with this book."
2,an exercise in misandry,"Starhawk's goddess religion is NOT paganism. Real paganism is POLYTHEISTIC, meaning male and female deities. In this vision of the future, only WOMEN are allowed on the high council. In her path of deities, there are only GODDESSES. So where is Zeus? Apollo? Thor?Nowhere to be seen. In Starhawk's Feminism as religion, the monotheistic God wears a dress. The Wild Boar people ( probably Celtic Reconstructionists and Asatru who got exiled for appealing to primary source material or hiding copies of the Poetic Edda from the wombyn-centric gynocratic book burners ) have no place in her society.Wouldnt wicca be more safe with no dreaded Asatru nearby practicing a religion with strong male deities and taste for red meat and mead? Wouldnt wicca be better off without Zeus, Pan, Odin, or Lugh? In Starhawk's vision, the world is finally fixed by castrating both men and Gods."
1,Calls for the end of America,The book describes a world where Northern California has become a communist country and the last capitalist city is in Southern California. The book describes the capitalist country as a facist government run by Christians. The North is led by former 1960's liberals who have eliminated most moral rules and brought back ancient religions. The book focuses on the North and the struggle to prevent diseases from killing off the northern cities.The book was fun to read at points as it causes you to hope for the capture of the north by the south
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This book is the most trite piece of literature I have ever read. It is over simplified and SO politically correct that it makes one sick to read it. Unless you are forced to, don't waste your time reading this book."
1,This fantasy story is nothing but trash,"While I do commend Starhawks' effort on creating a detailed utopia, the basis of this novel is weak. It is nothing more than a praise for a type of society that will never exist,for many good reasons.The notion of free-love that starhawk maintains is not real, nor will it ever be real.Free love is a fantasy- and those who think they are truly experiecing love are lost. The best that could happen to this book is spontaneous combustion."
5,A story that has stayed in my heart for many years,This story captured my heart and took me on a wonderful journey. Starhawk is a wonderful writer and my kind of visionary. She combined political intrique with love and adventure. This book is the perfect gift for someone you love!
1,This book is a sham!,"Zero claims in this book were ever substanciated and there is documented communication between the NCAA, NC State University and Jim Valvano that absolved the latter two from wrong doing. The book was so poorly written (obvious spelling errors, grammatical gaffes, not to mention mostly being a big, fat lie) that the original publisher rejected it as a first class hack job! The only suitable use for this book is to start a fire with it. Quite possibly the biggest work of fiction ever passed off as investigative reporting. Not even the Enquirer gets away with garbage like this!"
5,Terrific book,"This book outlines the scandals of the North Carolina State basketball program while Jim Valvano was the coach. Unfortunately the book is current as everyone knows that the same things are going on today. Many star basketball players shouldn't be in school and could care less about academics. Many of these players have had criminal activities which try to be suppressed. Jim Valvano knew what was going on but was only interested in winning basketball games. All college basketball fans should read this book to get a feel of what is going on today. Anyone ordering this book should get the Signet copy as it details the troubles the author had in getting this book published. Do not believe the negative reviews on amazon, a lot of it was from bitter fans who still look up to Jim Valvano. I highly recommend this book."
1,Personal Fouls: The Story of how Peter Golenbock killed a man and a school,"Peter Golenbock seems like nothing more to me than a man trying to make a name for himself by putting a black mark on one of the best athletic programs in the country. NC State basketball would have been just as competitive as their neighbors in Winston-Salem, Chapel Hill, and Durham in the 90's if it hadn't been for this book. This book is filled with inacuracies and falsehoods that may have been present at NCSU in a lesser form, but more so present at other schools around the ACC and abroad. In all I think this book led to Jim Valvano's downfall and his death to cancer in 1993. Finally, Herb Sendek has our pack on back track and we are returning to our proper place in Raliegh during basketball season as opposed to being ""That other school in North Carolina""."
1,an unsubstaniated attack on a basketball coach,"Personal Fouls is a book that should never have been published. Reputable publishers turned it down. The book is filled with errors, innuendo and outright lies. The primary sources were a disgruntled ex-manager and some disgruntled players, very small sample of the people that came into contact with Jim Valvano. The author used misinformation and half-truths to sensationalize some of the problems in college basketball in general and NC State's program in particular. Golenback used sources that obviously had axes to grind destroy the reputation of a man who was not perfect but was not greedy monster that the book portrayed. (the NCAA investigater wrote a letter in which Valvano was exonerated and the investigater expressed admiration) The publisher of this piece of trash allowed Golenbock to use questionable sources to discredit a fine man for their mutual profit. The book is a disgrace and the author is beneath contempt."
4,These things are cool!,"I've tried other neoprene shorts but I really like these. They fit nice and snug and look just like regular biker shorts; other neoprene shorts make me feel like I'm trying to workout in a potato sack while wrapped in Saran Wrap. Not too sure if they are making a significant impact on my cellulite (I just got them), but they DEFINITELY help suck out excess water and therefore make me look thinner in my ""problem areas."" I only wish they were a little longer, but I still give them an ""A""!."
5,"bye, bye bumpies","Working out helps, but these shorts are a HUGE help to get rid of the ugly bumpies on your butt and thighs, especially when you are retaining extra water! This is the first pair I have ever worn that actually pass as real gym shorts/bike shorts. I wear them under mesh shorts, and no one knows! They are thinner than the other rubber shorts sold as ""spa shorts"". Just be sure to wash them before you wear them the first time, as they do have that ""rubbery"" odor to them. Go get a pair....you will not be dissapointed!"
3,......,"Well, I havent had any drastic results with the shorts. I havent used them on a regular basis though. They do cause you to sweat a lot, so Im sure they would help if you wear them daily. Just be sure to order a couple sizes smaller than usual. They are large and are supposed to be tight on you.It says to hand wash, but I use the washer and it works fine. Just let air dry. If you have larger legs that rub together, even a small bit, you cant really wear them in public unless you want everyone to hear you walk from a mile away!"
4,Really makes you sweat alot!,I wear this suit under my gym clothes and it really does make you sweat a lot but the jury is still out on the reduction of cellulite. My thighs appear smoother looking after every work out but that could just be from me working so hard on the treadmill. But I will keep wearing them to the gym to keep my water weight off and because it is not as bulky underneath my clothes as the other neoprine shorts I usually purchase. I wash them in the washer on gentle cycle and they air dry rather quickly.
3,Too Expensive for what it does...,"I had to choose between this and a workout video program. I'm not a very active person, so my choice was obvious. Anyway, the shipping was fast but when I took the shorts out of the package, I realized that it was almost identical to the material that scuba divers wear. It feels like a wet suit...but it does keep really warm inside. Like when I took them off, I was freezing.These are just like every other ""make you sweat bodysuit"" even the cheap ones. You must be active to sweat, you cannot be sitting with them on and expect to sweat a whole lot like I did. I bought a small and I'm 5'3 125lbs...its a little tight around the tummy, but fits great.Anyway, I think its a good product, but its not worth over 25 dollars."
2,Ritche & His Epic Solo's,"The music is good. But, it is hard to watch from the beginning to the end. Ritchie's guitar solos just drone on and on and on ... It was nice to see Ronnie James Dio's 1st ever professionally filmed concert ever."
5,live in munich 1977,most excellent concert. they all came together flawlessly. each bringing their individual talent to the stage with great finesse!!
5,Rainbow Live in Munich 77,"A must have for any real metal fan.The holy trinity of Ronnie James Dio (the all time master) Blackmore,and Cozy is the end all be all,of all time.30 years old and this show is still a master work. After that line-up sadly Rainbow was no longer Rainbow. Thank God Dio still plays some of those songs live. Buy this DVD NOW!"
4,Dio & Blackmore heavy magic!,"For purists the extra videos are great. For new fans this is rock...talented people who know their instruments.It's wonderful on so many levels. For me, I believe one can pick up on how much Ronnie was sick and tired of Mr. Blackmore - I find it quite amusing! I also must agree with the complete Rainbow fans, where the hell is *Stagazer*? I know, it was tough on Cozy. They didn't always play it but was it on the set list only to be omitted from the German TV taping or this DVD?Still, us fan's are fortunate for this product!* I did see Ronnie & Jimmy Bain along with Simon Wright and D. Aldrich play ""Stargazer"" live on the KTD tour at Desert Sky outdoor venue in Phoenix, Arizona AT SUNSET and felt VERY BLESSED to say the least because that was half of Rainbow! HOLY CHRIST."
5,AS GOOD AS IT GETS!,"No need to go to the esplanade in Boston on the forth of July. Just watch Cozy play the 1812th. Combined with Ronnie's powerful voice and stage theatrical style, Ritchie's expressions and ""no need to say"" on stage presence, you have the best you can get. They just don't make live rock shows like this anymore. If your a Rainbow/Blackmore/Dio fan, you will not be dissapointed. I would have paid two or three times more for this dvd. enjoy!"
2,It was good but boring.,This was a good dvd but way too boring for me. Blackmore is so full of himself that it gets old watching him.
2,The sound leaves alot to be desired...,The sound on this release is not up to standards. Stick with the old Deep Purple remasters.
2,Boooooorrrrrring,"Way too much noodling and horsing around by Blackmore. DP would never have let him get away with all the foolishness and wasted space that sucks up time on here. More songs, better editing, more Dio & less goofing off Ritchie, please"
3,allright could have been great,"To long on the solos,Made it kind of boring,Could have picked a few different songs.Dio and Co. were right on and killer that night.Ritchie was great, but like I said he was a little boring and selfesh with those long solos."
5,Blackmore is so hot!,"I was looking forward to getting this show and it exceeded expectations. Catch the Rainbow has one of the most incredibly smokin' hot solos. Ritchie is simply phenominal throughout. The overall sound of the show is excellent, for Rainbow fans this is a MUST HAVE!"
3,A newer edition is available,There is a newer edition of the Panama Canal map now available. Please see the newer edition atPanama Canal Map by Cruise Map Publishing Company.
4,Great Desk Lamp,Man this thing is bright!!! Easily adjustable.Only con to it it gets way too hot. You could use it as a heat lamp to keep food warm.
2,Nice while it worked,"This was a nice lamp. Unfortunately it stopped working after 5 months of minimal use. I replaced the halogen bulb, triple checked everything I could. I have no idea why it no longer works. While not terribly expensive, it just seems to me this is a fairly lousy product if it ceases working after only 5 months."
4,Good solid build quality,great lamp for the price. And it has two light levels! Seems sturdy and I'm guessing it will hold up. And the position adjustments seem nice and tight so the light doesn't sag.
3,"Reports of the Sasquatch in Alberta, Canada","This volume deals with sightings primarily in the providence of Alberta, Canada. Most of the reports that have previously been published of this animal have been in British Columbia. It may surprise some readers that the Sasquatch has been reported in other providences. The writers style is a bit rambling, however he has personally investigated most of the sightings in this book. The reports are not as detailed as some other investigators in the field such as John Green, but this book is a good addition to anyone interested in this subject's library."
3,"Its cool,but not what I thought it would be","Theres a lot of cool footage,and the Three Stooges story was interesting, but it just wasnt what I thought it would be.It is about 9 hours of Three Stooges stuff,like a big compilation of scenes.I was hoping for a few whole Three Stooges episodes,but this didnt have any.It was kinda sad watching the more modern clips(in color)where the guys are obviously elderly & trying to do the same mindless violence as they had for so many years,but just couldnt pull it off like before.Its a cool collection of clips,stories & a few movies,but still wasnt what I thought it would be."
4,Giant Nelson Ned,"Nelson Ned sings the songs from quite a few famous singers. He does a very good job by far. He comes up a little short on a couple of those renditions, such as ""Volver, Volver"". While it is not his best CD, it has a lot of all-time standards such as ""La Barca"" ""Abrazame"" and a few others. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase."
1,Unauthorized expansion based on free mods,"This ""expansion"" is unauthorized by Ubisoft, and because the makers are charging money for it, is illegal. In addition, any of the features found in this ""expansion"" can be had for free from mod-makers at various websites dedicated to submarine simulations. Save yourself some money and don't help these thieves."
1,Save your money,This expansion pack does not alow silent hunter 3 to even open on my windows xp. In fact it is unauthorised by SH3!
3,Lost at sea,A little hard to learn how to play. Once you get the basics down it becomes a lot interesting.
4,"Pretty darn good for a ""Dummies"" publication!","I haven't always found the ""For Dummies"" books to be extremely helpful in the realm of software guides. This book, however, proved to surpass my expectations.The language style was very beginner-friendly. The order of presentation of the programs and features in the CS suite made sense. The index was highly inclusive and helpful.This book is geared toward someone totally new to the Adobe programs. It's a step-by-step approach to familiarizing the reader to the basics of the Suite's features and helping the reader recognize when the different programs can be used in conjunction with one-another for effective results. I would not recommend it for people who already have experience with Adobe Programs and wish to brush up on the new features in CS, but for beginners to Adobe it's a comfortable place to get your feet wet."
1,Good grief...,"Worthless is the keyword here. About as clear as mud. I purchased ACS primarily for use on a website. This book could not even get me past the opening screen of the GoLive program--I had to go to a non-dummy book (Adobe Creative Suite Bible) to get that info. Don't be a dummy--spend your dollars for smarts, which isn't to be found in this book. I wish we could give zero, or negative, scores."
2,"Good for beginners, but...","As a graphic designer with a working knowledge of these programs, I should have known the questions I'd have would be a bit more in depth than an all-in-one book would cover. This book consistently let me down, sometimes not even covering topics I needed to know more about (H&J settings, layer questions, etc.). If you're new to this software, and need to know the basics, this book would be great for you. If you're beyond the basics - try getting whole books on the programs you're using."
2,one more opinion,"I don't agree with the previous reviewer about the value of thisbook - I think that with several minor exceptions there is nothing in this book which could justify its publication.Of course, as it is clear to every expert, there is nothingreally new in this book; but sometimes one can rewrite oldthings in such a way that a new book is justified.With the material of this book I know much better expositionsof every chapter of it (including harmonic analysis, number theory and Tate-Iwasawa method) in other sourses.There are also some mistakes and errors (for example,the Poisson summation formula is not proven),some of which may cause the readerthink that there were mistakes on the original works.This text could have appeared online as lecture notes,but the publication of it by Springer confirm the well known fact of degradation of their mathematical series.D. Ziegler"
1,Not what was advertised,"Not the Original artists. This cd was a big disapointment. It says Various artists, it is not. All songs done by a group called ""The Soundalikes"""
1,Big Disappointment!,"The ""paint"" doesn't work very well, and the sponges fall apart. We actually use it for finger painting instead! Save your money."
2,Not worthy of the company name,"My 5-year-old son saw this product advertised and was so excited by the concept. I trusted the brand name and ordered it for him. We were so disappointed with the flimsiness of the product as we pulled it out of the box, the tiny portions of paint and paper included. But when we tried to actually use the sponges as advertised, dragging them across the paints, then painting with them, our disappointment grew. We paint together quite a bit, and after one 10-minute session, this thing was abandoned by both mother and child. Buy the biggest box of Crayola crayons, a simple old-fashioned set of watercolors, a nice pad of paper, and a decent-quality paintbrush instead ... you could get that all for the price of this set."
1,Would Not Recommend,"This is cheap, cheap, cheap. Sounded like a great concept, but it was extremely frustrating to use - - the sponges don't work well at all, and you can't get any real ""color"" from them. The paper provided was small and flimsy. I felt bad for my son as we worked together to try and paint. I can't believe I bought him such a junkie set. I agree with the other reviewer, invent in a good brush and a ""real"" paint set."
1,So embarrassed...,"My nephew has the real ""as seen on TV"" set of watercolors and it is great! My 5 yo daughter and 3 yo son loved playing it at my sister's house. When I saw this set by Crayola, I purchased 2 for gifts and my son added it to his Christmas list. When Santa brought it, we were SOOOOO disappointed and it quickly made it's way to the back of the closet. The sponges aren't nearly big or thick enough and it was very frustrating for both of my kids. I had a very hard time making a rainbow with it! Now, I am so embarrassed that I gave the other two as gifts to two friends' children. That is the last time I simply trust the brand name and don't testdrive a toy first. This is a piece of junk and I think Crayola has a lot nerve charging $20 for it."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old son, he was very excited about it, but wasn't excited any more when he started to paint w/it. He knew how to paint w/it and everything, but that colors weren't as bright or pretty as it was on T.V., after playing w/it for about 20 min. He never touched it again, in fact he threw it away!"
1,AWFUL,"My daughter was so excited to have one of these after seeing commercials a million times over on how easy it was and what pretty pictures can be created. It didn't work at all. It left everything a brown mess. To get the sponges wet enough to pick up color, it was still messy and most times it never picked up enough color to ""paint"" with. Not worth it. My daughter learned with this product that commercials can be very deceiving."
5,What the Bible is All About: Bible Handbook,I received my book fast and with prompt service. I was very pleased with the condition of the book. I would definitely order again from this company.
5,Bible Study,"My Study Group is using What the Bible is All About, along with the Bible, for better understanding. This handbook book is easy to use and is perfect for our needs. It's a must have/read book."
5,The green tube,"I would highly recommend this gel. It just seems to fit with my hair, doesn't make it greasy, works well."
1,Not compatible,"Even though packaging indicates this is for the Nokia 6682, it definitely will not work with that phone"
2,useless item,"This belt holster is not of good quality. Not recommended to buy. Plastic gives a cheap look and the grip is not good either. My phone got dropped from this holster a couple of times esp, while removing car seat-belt and coming out from car.Better and cheaper options are available on other websites."
4,Hundreds of hopping hoppers,"Although scientific names are a bit out of date, this book helps the serious student identify almost all of the roaches, mantids, walking sticks, earwigs, grasshoppers, and crickets in the U.S. I had a copy some time ago, lost it, and am glad to find another to replace it. The information in this book is at the level of a good field guide, but more complete than any could be. This is a great reference for the naturalist or field biologist involved with grasshoppers and their kin."
4,like fine corinthian leather,"This CD is smooth like VSOP, grooving like a jukebox 45, smoking like a '70 Cuda on blacktop, and easy like fine corinthian leather. A mixmaster's delight of sounds for those of us suffering from Pop Culture Braincloud Overload. Pepper's Ghost will get the party started. Get in on the Conspiracy; combustible and refreshing all at once."
2,Not happy with this bk at all.Liked his bks in #s better.,I have 2 other bks of his. I don't like the hummels listed by year at all. Makes it more difficult to look for your refrence #s.The other bks made it simpler to find what yiu were looking for. Un happy that I can't get his 1998 hummel price bk.
5,the best,"We run a vocational school to teach people to become professional dog trainers and we recommend this book to all of our students. It covers all breeds (not just AKC breeds), and covers just about everything about dogs including basic medical info. Great for dog lovers and professionals alike. Lots of color pictures and very organized and easy to use/find info."
3,Fair condition,"The camera was a little more banged up than was expected. My best guess is everyone has a different scale for rating good, fair, or poor condition. Cosmetically this camera would be more like a poor to fair condition. It works perfectly as it was listed. Quick shipping and packaging was done nicely although Im not sure why because it was already dented up =) I purchased this to replace my daughters other concert camera because it takes amazing photos and isnt super expensive if she loses it."
1,This is an expensive disposable camera,"I bought this camera 14 months ago. I have had issues with it locking up which is annoying. Then one day I got a red screen and a 000000018-4489-957-000 error message. After researching, contacting HP and visiting discussion boards, I discovered it was a hardware problem. The long and the short of it is, once the hardware fails, the camera is done! It will cost you around $150+ to fix it and HP thinks you should pay that after spending $250+ for the camera. Of course HP believes that 14 months is a reasonable amount of time to not make them liable for the junk they are manufacturing in China. It is clearly a manufacturing defect! Search the message boards and you will read about the frustrations of others with the hardware failure problem. Don't waste your money on the Photosmart line of products. I am going to stick with the traditional photo equipment manufacturers in the future.*****DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PHOTOSMART LINE OF PRODUCTS.*****"
1,Worst Camera I have ever owned.,"It seems like the other two reviewers are happy with the pictures they get from this camera, but I am not. The camera takes really dark pictures no matter what setting you use. The only pictures that seem OK are outside photos in bright sunlight. I had a Kodak before that blew this camera away. I do have to say that I took the camera out of the box charged the battery and expected the auto mode to solve any problems. But I have also tried the setting modes to no avail."
4,Very Good!!,"Lovers is a ""sequel"" to Scruples 2. I like it a lot, but I didn't like it as much as Scruples 2. You read about Gigi and Vito, Sasha, Zach and Billy and Spider. Lovers is a more subdued version of Scruples 1 and 2. Some parts are boring, while others soar. The relationship between Sasha and Vito is a bit far-fetched as far as I'm concerned, but it's a good read overall."
4,long live Scruples sequels!,"While Lovers did not seem to hold my attention as well as Scruples I and II, I loved returning to these colorful characters.... couldn't buy Sasha and Vito. But I still loved it!"
2,Not as good as OEM.,"The mirror mechanism cannot be adjusted to the correct position for me, and the mirror vibrates within the housing at highway speeds. The optics are not the same as factory, and the field of vision is smaller. If you just want to pass your safety inspection, it is much cheaper than dealer price of $200-250. Just not as good as OEM."
4,"This is the worst volume yet, but still good","This is the worst volume yet, but it's still pretty good. It starts off with a Christmas episode. Matsuri comes up with another crazy idea to exploit Yurie's powers at the shrine. Epsiode 14 is pretty bad, Yurie spends the entire episode under the heated table just chatting with her family. The last 2 episodes of this series are about Valentines Day and Yurie's love confession. The ending of this anime is pretty good. Like I said, this is the weakest volume, but it's still pretty good and worth watching."
3,Not Bad But Not Great Either,"I ordered this for my girlfriend as a stocking stuffer and I expected a lot more than what I got. The charm itself is a decent size but it is very thin and the indentations in the metal just make it look a little cheap. And considering it was $16 for a single charm, the craftsmanship could be a lot better than what it is."
5,"Yup, a must read...","I am currently taking a course in Information Management and this book was recommended. I waited about a month for the book and was very frustrated. I have only just began to read this book and I can say that it was definitely worth the wait. The book is written in such clear and easy to understand language that it would make you look forward to the next time you open it. There wasn't a topic in my course that I was not able to find here. Apart from the fact that I got this book just two days before an exam, I have no complaints... lol"
5,Macromedia Flash Pro 8 is great.,"Macromedia Flash Pro 8 is a really great product. I am still learning about Flash with the help of its extensive tutorials. It was easy to install on my computer which runs on a 64 bit Windows 7 Professional OS.I am in no position to compare it to Adobe's version but I am very happy with my purchase. One thing is for sure, I saved a ton of money."
2,Get a clue Macromedia,"I don't know if the macromedia personell will read this, but every person I've talked to about this program has said that flash was SO much easier BEFORE actionscript came into existence. I'm in a actionscript class right now and I am starting to believe it. I hope they get a clue and either make the script easier to use with a translator or something, or take it out completely, cause the current system right now, is failing miserabley."
1,keeps breaking,Keeps breaking for no apparent reason. Standard .065 line lasts much longer. What a disapointment. Stick with the regular round line it works much better and longer.
2,Looks good until you wear it,"The look you get when you wear this Cub hat is one of those trucker hats have. When the forehead is all puffed out. If you like that look buy this, if not stay away from this hat."
5,Soothing Bedtime Story,"I am new to the Little Quack's series and was delighted that this was my first read. The thicker board pages are a great feature, but my favorite part is the fact that not only does this book contain images that take up the entire double pages, but the illustrations are very sooothing, with the water scenes in oranges, yellows, blues and purple colors. In this 16 page story, the mother duck soothes the common night fears such as stange noises, lights, and tricky shadows that her baby ducklings are frightened of. I read this to my three year old and needless to say, this is now part of our bedtime ritual. It is great to be able to show him that he is not the only one that feels scared of the darkness. We look forward to reading the other books in the series to help with the other stressors of ""growing up""!"
4,Little Quack's bedtime,"This is a cardboard book for toddlers and small children. Written by Lauren Thompson. It's a sweet story about a Mama duck and her ducklings trying to go to sleep, but Little Quack is afraid of the dark. This little duckling is adorable, with so many questions. ""What's that Mama, did you hear that Mama, listen to that Mama, did you hear it?"" With Mama duck having all the answers to comfort her babies. A charming story for those little one's with lots of questions before bedtime. Sweet story to get your little one to sleep at night. Recommended for toddlers and preschoolers."
2,"bland bedtime fare--- just okay, nothing special","I'm surprised by all of the reviews praising the illustrations-- I wasn't impressed at all with them or the story.This book's plot is simple. Several ducklings are worried by sights and sounds at night. Mother Duck reassures them (for example, she explains that worrisome lights are fireflies flashing their ""good night"" lights), and one by one the little ducklings fall asleep.I found the mother duck to be oddly drawn, and the ducklings other than Little Quack just plain weird-looking, with simulated orange ""hair"" (in contrast with their yellow down) sticking up on their heads.Just not my style. For cute books including ducklings I'd suggest John Butler'sHush Little Ones, the adorable Daisy books by Jane Simmons,such asDaisy and the Moon, or Matthew Van Fleet'sFuzzy Yellow Ducklings. Better yet, try the classicMake Way for Ducklings."
4,Perfect for bedtime reading,"I purchased this book to add some variety to the ""bedtime"" books I read to my 4 month old. She loves the other Little Quack books we have and this seemed a perfect addition. The pages are colorful enough to hold her attention. And we get to learn about Little Quack and siblings trying to get to sleep. I would def recommend to any parent to add this to their child's library."
4,My little guy loves this book,My 1.5 year old loves this book and constantly pulls it off of the shelf for me to read. The book has vibrant illustrations and includes a short story that enforces concepts in counting. Great Board Book to add to your collection - your little one will love it!
4,Cute Story,Little Quack's Bedtime is a cute story of how a family of ducks settle in for the night. Nice illustrations and easy verbiage make this book a good read for kids at bedtime. My children easily picked up the rhythm and flow of the story as it unfolded. Pretty good book for the library. Enjoyable.
4,Cute Bedtime Story,"It is bedtime, but five little ducklings keep stalling with questions. They look and listen for things to ask about. One by one they fall asleep until Little Quack cannot hear or see anything to alarm him. What can he ask about? ""Why is the night so dark?"" Mama Duck answers him and is finally the only one awake.The chunky board book is combined with nice pictures and a cute bedtime story for little ones, but parents will enjoy reading it to them... over and over again."
4,Cute,"A cute book for little ones. I did give it a 4 rather than a 5 for one reason - there is one illustration of a tree that looks like the tree has hands that are reaching out for the ducklings and I think this could be scary for some kids. Other than that, cute illustrations."
3,Cute Enough,"This is a cute little book to teach small children that those shapes you see at night and those strange noises are nothing to fear. The story is sweet, the illustrations are nice. Although there's nothing super original about it, its a nice little book."
3,The same Little Quack,"This is a sweet little story, but I was hoping for more. Or at least something new.We have three Little Quack books. My kids love them, but I find them repetetive. The illustrations are adorable, vibrant in color. The plot, however, is the same in each book. One by one the five little ducks do as they're told, while Mama Duck exercises extreme patience and unending love. I ordered this book hoping it would illustrate cute ways to help little ones fall asleep. Instead it just talks about noises around the pond. Even those descriptions lack imagination.If this is your first Little Quack book, you'll enjoy its simple tenderness. If you already know Little Quack, you may want to save your money and just read the one you have again."
5,This is a great book.,"My children and I love all the Little Quack's books. After buying Little Quack and Little Quack's Hide and Seek, we just had to have this one too."
4,"Fun and Practical for Word Mavens, English Teachers, and English Language Learners","Why rhyme? It's fun and sometimes practical - especially for word mavens, promising poets, English teachers, and many English language learners.I have kept a copy of this small rhyming dictionary in my office - and often put in my backpocket - while teaching ESL students. This small reference work, logically organized, helps show English language learners the gap between how words are spelled and how they sound. You can instantly share sounds - and ask students to write lists of words to memorize. So whether exposing students to new words or emphasizing word endings and common suffixes, this pocket reference book makes life easier for English teachers and tutors. Besides, it costs almost nothing!"
5,Just got this,"Just picked up a copy of this from a publishing friend, topnotch CDs, great package as well. The CDs have drawings by Ginsberg printed onto them, and the cardboard sleeve has filmstills from the readings these are taken from at the Knitting Factory. The booklet is lengthy and detailed, with some short pieces by different writers, but they're rather short. One apparently read with Ginsberg these nights; would like to have read more, perhaps? But a great pleasure, to hear these poems in order, great sound quality. Listening to it right now."
3,life in crisis,Moving story about life in crisis between a daughters love for her mother and trying to get her off the streets and falling into
1,lousy and realistic,"This movie reflects very small part of reality in Israel. Its basically as depressing as its neighbores and gives false impression of desperation. The nudity, which is often, is treated as another negativity and sex is one more burden. My impression of Israel was completely opposite and more close to ""Holy land"" where characters are trying to think and do."
5,"Lightning, Indeed!","When strictly-business Kelly Sullivan meets drop-dead gorgeous Conor O'Meara, with the intent of turning his family's ancestral castle into a luxury hotel, sparks fly from their first moments together--and build into some luscious, tender heat when they succumb to a two-different-worlds romance despite their better judgment. MIDSUMMER LIGHTNING features two nosy Irish aunts and a former flame of Conor's to up the ante of the suspense, as well as a pair of impossibly snooty parents and some corporate villains out only for their own gain, at Kelly's expense. Kate Ivers has done an admirable job portraying her breezy, contemporary heroine while credibly allowing Kelly to undergo a total attitude adjustment by the story's end. Conor O'Meara is an Irishman any woman could fall in love with, and I thoroughly enjoyed this story!"
4,Fantastic Finale,Ippo and Sendo go at it one more time with Sendo's Japan Featherweight Championship Belt at statke. Sendo was looking to erase memories of his loss to Ippo in this match and prove to everyone that he was the best featherweight in Japan. This had to be the longest and best fight of the entire series in my opinion. You can't help but get sucked into the fight. This was a great finish to a great series.
1,Worthless Reading,"This ""book"" is a major disappointment, using small print, black and white photos, this is more of a guide book than anything else. Continue your search elsewhere if you are researching Asian Architecture..."
3,Review,Wish it didn't have the parsely seasoning in it. I have to pick it out with a spoon before I eat it.
5,The Second Part,"My homegirl gave me these books (thugs are for fun and thugs ain't no fun at all). I didn't think i'd be into them as a man, but they had my attention. Since reading them I even started reading more black books."
4,Unable to live by my rules,"Jacilyn ""Jacy"" Thomas is still the same. Or is she? Popi isn't abiding by the laws that she usually demands. Although it has only been a few months into this relationship she's realized this situation may be completely out of control.After seeing Rich, her former enthusiast she wonders what she ever saw in Popi. Rich didn't stop feeling for Jaci he simply didn't have a way to contact her. With the time that has passed can these two find the light at the end of the tunnel?"
3,"ESV WINS, Crossway fails.","First off, the translate is amazing! I love it. The binding is great. I love the feel of the calfskin... BUT, the printing is horrible. Text bleed on every single page and the text alignment is all over the place. Some margins are wide and some are cramped. I returned my first one because of this issue, but after one month, they sent my replacement and it was worst than the first one. If you want to be buy a premium ESV bible, wait for Cambridge."
5,A justification of the ESV bible,"Check out ""The Word of God in English: Criteria for Excellence in Bible Translation"" by Leland Ryken, ISBN 1581344643. He was a consultant on the ESV bible translation committee and provides a justification in this book for the ESV bible translation methodology."
3,Not a new version,"I agree with another reviewer's comments that this is basically another RSV. I was disappointed that some of the endorsers listed would so highly recommend such a version. Phil. 1:6, and 2 Tim. 1:12 were disappointing translations. One reason is because I checked them against the Greek and they don't match exactly. (This being the ultimate measure of a good translation)Plus, I have at least 23 bible versions on my computer and not one (except RSV) matches the ESV's rendering of these verses.Nevertheless, the free CD program is neat and it is an easy reading version."
3,"Simple, No Frills, Bible",I have had this Bible for about 5 years now. the print is a little small and its a little thicker than I would like in a Bible to carry back and forth to meetings and church. The cross reference and concordance is among the worst I've used in any Bible. The publishers must have spent so much money getting the rights to the transalation that they could'nt put much else into it.
2,Memory foam particles dropping out easily,"This pillow came with no additional cover over the foam material, unlike other memory foam pillow. This result to alot of tiny foam particles will drop out easily when u remove the pillow case for washing. My wife encounter some asthma attack after breathing those particles. It is really a health hazard encounter.Returning the item is a hassle too, the shipping costs add up will be almost equivalent to the product cost.Rating it 2 star because item is delivered promptly."
5,A Wake Up Call to an Inherently American Issue,"Zed Nelson's haunting book ""Gun Nation"" is in the same camp with Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" as a hard-hitting wake up call to our enduring love affair with guns, and the ensuing bloodbath that results.Nelson's images speak volumes. The photos themselves, as the purest, most powerful form of photojournalism, tell the tale; a tale of the Wild American West gone way too wild.I love this book!"
1,pure filth,"Being English, the author has no understanding of American ideas about liberty and self reliance. The book is unappologetic propaganda with no attempt to understand how or why firearms save millions of lives. If you believe that guns are evil, with the capacity to turn otherwise normal people into raving lunatics or that the American people are just too stupid to be trusted with firearms but can operate motor vehicles and aircraft just fine, well this book will confirm what you already believe. If you are capable of using logic and separating fact from emotional hyperbole you may very well vomit."
2,Pretty but fatuous.,"The shots of Paris are nice, and there are some laughs with the Hemingway character, but this movie is a little brainless. Poor Rachel MacAdams has to play a character who is unrealistically awful. And as is often the case in Woody Allen movies (remember Husbands and Wives?), the male character basically rationalizes his impulse to be unfaithful with the very convenient discovery that his partner is cheating on *him*.The problem isn't just that the movie isn't particularly smart. It's that it also makes the director seem like kind of a bad person who doesn't respect his audience's intelligence."
2,Yuck!!!,"This movie was a big disappointment. Like most Woody Allen movies, which are too witty for their own good, I did not enjoy it. In fact, I stopped watching it before the end."
2,Disappointing.,"In a word - disappointing. The usual Woody Allen character appears again with the usual dialog. This time the actor is directed to imitate Woody because Woody would be too old to play the part. While the cinematography of Paris was excellent and the story line intriguing at times, the Woody character has become such a cliché that it needs to be left behind in his future movies."
2,Typical Woodsy-Allen,"I should have known!!! These Woodsy-Allen movies, they're all about misunderstandings and lack of respect from each of the characters. The McAdams character: I'd say she's the weakest in the show as she has no respect for Wilson's character. The ""know-it-all"" douche is so cliche.But, pretty standard for a Woodsy-Allen movie. I'm glad I only blew a buck + tax for this movie."
4,Nearly but not quite...,"This was a charming film but not charming enough to give it more than 4 stars. In all aspects I found this picture just that little bit lacking compared to say a ""Love Actually"".It was witty but not witty enough; the cast was good but didn't grab you enough; you cared for the characters but never really were very concerned about them. In my view this film could have been better with another director. Sometimes Woody can do too much!"
4,Enjoyable story,"I like Woody Allen movies, this being no exception. It has the usual interesting, quirky characters and slightly unexpected plot. Its just the kind of story that Woody Allen does so well. He also has a real knack for getting the setting just right, whether its a particular place (like Paris or Manhattan) or a period in time.I personally enjoyed guessing which artists from the 20's would show up, played as we imagined them to be, of course. I found the movie to be visually appealing, funny and heartwarming. I think most Woody Allen fans will agree."
3,Video and Audio quality,"Enjoyed the movie in the theatre, so I could not wait to see it again on Blu-ray.However, I was disappointed with the video and audio quality.The picture quality was sharp but the majority of scenes were far too yellow and the audio was a disappointment.......only 3.0 and not 5.1 audio sound.Not good enough for todays high Blu-ray standards.My Video rating and Audio rating out of 5.......is 2.5"
3,just okay,"I'd love to join the ranks of people who love this movie. Off the top, it had two really great things going for it: (1) Paris and (2) its thought-provoking concept. Where it derails is that it is entirely too heavy-handed in getting its point across. We get it--he and his fiancee are incompatible; his foil is a complete talking head who everyone else loves; and other things I won't reveal just in case you're still wanting to see it. Trust me, we get it. It was too much in my opinion. Nuance has its virtues."
5,"If Allen had never brought us another movie, this one would be enough.","In some ways, I would compare this flick with ""Love and Death,"" although Woody Allen's off-putting cynicism is notably absent this time around. Perhaps Allen is mellowing out, to his very great credit, as he gets older.It's no coincidence that Paris has been such a center of cultural ferment. It's as if a magnetic force draws the most creative and quirky literary and artistic figures there. Unlike many other places that are dominated entirely by powerful institutions, Paris is a place where such ""nobodies"" as Mogdiliani and Hemingway found their true place in the world. Owen Wilson's character goes through his own inner transformation through the City of Light.This is a thoroughly charming flick, one of the best I've seen during the last few years."
2,Midnight in Paris,"Not Woody Allen's best. Plot a bit too contrived, and not very funny. It's worth watching for Marion Cotilliard though."
5,Midnight in Paris,"I love this movie, I love Paris and the street sceens are wonderfulAnd the cast of famous characters are fab."
4,Suprisingly good movie,"I'm not a big Woody Allen fan, but I quite enjoyed this one. Woody Allen's typical neurotic role is played by Owen Wilson and he's not as annoying as Allen usually is. Good to watch the movie to see how Allen weaves the several literary reference to express his theme."
1,Not a Very good Movie,After having been to Paris recently we were interested in seeing this movie. The Paris scenery in the movie is great. Toon bad we couldn't say the same for the plot. Not good at all.
1,not your best woody,"i like woody allen movies, but not this one, the lead charcater has the same mannerisms , the same wallk, same hand gestures,as woody in his movies, it seems that woody wanted to be in the movie, but maybe he was too old to be the charcter, he casted an actor to walk talk gesture like himself, i would rather watch annie hall, or hanna and her sisters, than watch this movie ,and also the hands in the pockets like woody, maybe the younger generation didnt notice it while watching because they arent familar with woody allen, but to me i immediatly notice this annoying aspect of the charcter, woody, if you are going to write a movie write one better than this.awful.yuk"
1,Pretensious,"As a long time Woody Allen fan, I couldn't wait to see this film...what a diappointment! This movie in a word is ""pretensious."" Trying to be high class while being a horrible movie. If you love all that fake glamour of the 1920's, go for it. Otherwise, spend you money elsewhere. I regret to say that I am no longer a Woody Allen fan."
1,Same old clichés...,"I guess we're so used to watching mediocre movies that some can be pleasant to watch. That is the case of this one. The movie is plagued by lamentable clichés about France, French culture, and Paris. I think these clichés only exist in the imagination of some snobby new yorkers any more.This movie could be the work of a 25yo spoiled rich girl making a movie about life staged in Paris. Disconcertingly poor in terms of vision and message; eminently cliché in terms of its references. I'm not pro or against Woodie Allen - I find some of his movies good, some more repetitive and average. And I love Owen Wilson. So really, my review is not one of these anti-Allen ones. I just found this movie somewhat insulting to watch. Clearly the work of an aging man that has no problem showering you with old clichés and presenting them as enlightening."
1,Boring,"Oh God! It was so boring. I expected much more out of this movie. I love Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams. It was too long and far fetched and just a bad story that could have been a lot better. If you want a good nap, rent it and watch it."
1,AWFUL,"Holy crap, this movie is terrible. I'm not even an hour into the movie and I'm pretty sure it's the worst thing I've ever seen."
1,SOOOOO Boring!!,"This movie was so boring I could not even sit through it without fast forwarding it to the end.Not only was it boring and the music completely annoying, Amazon fed me a standard definition version, which made the experience that much worse.I am not sure why Amazon lowered the feed from HD to standard. I stream HD movies from Netflix all the time without any problem.I am sure some people loved this movie. I found it to be less than 1 star. Sorry."
1,I would give it no stars if possible,"This is an hour and a half I've wasted on a bunch of no talent ""actors"" working with a contrived, unfunny script."
1,ZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZ,"So Booooooooooring... I just woke up! I dont understand how the Tomatometer failed me. In the past its always been on the money. Not this time. I think somewhat got paid to put numbers higher. I slept through some of this crap because it was... uh mmmh did I mention... so booooring. Acting seemed fake. I usually love anything Rachel is in, not this. Maybe its Woody, I dont think I have ever liked any of his movies."
2,I'm at a loss,"I do not understand how this movie has so many 5 and 4 star reviews. The story is flat; there is no real emotion; it feels thrown together. It feels like it was written by some 20s art/lit fanboy (who is probably much like the ""pedantic"" character in the movie we're supposed to hate).The story is predicable and not engaging whatsoever. The acting is sub-par; same with the directing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone; even my literature-buff friends.I'm not really sure who would like this movie."
4,romantic wandering,"I really enjoyed this film. I found the mood and the story to be very romantic - even with its romantic disappointments. All of the cameos from the 20s are really fun, and Owen Wilson is surprisingly charming in his portrayal of Gil. It's a short story with a succinct message, which I found to be sweet and melancholy. The filming is beautiful and golden. Very romantic. Would watch again."
3,"Not a W.A. fan, but enjoyed this movie","I wouldn't consider myself a Woody Allen fan, but I enjoyed this movie. There were times that the acting seemed forced (in fact, I think the American actors could have learned some lessons from the Parisian/French actors on authenticity). But overall, I had fun with the film. There were points where it seemed forced. I like Owen Wilson, but he just didn't seem engaged in his role, or perhaps the right fit. He's definitely intelligent, like the role needed, but his delivery wasn't believable. ""Oh, you want me to do this right now? Okay."" Perhaps a little too dry. He just seemed along for the ride and even when he had his moments of clarity, it wasn't as if it was a big connect for him but... well, he was reading his lines. No real emotional transparency, and that's what I enjoy about actors.I was definitely entertained by the movie and have recommended it to friends."
5,good story,"I remember when WOody Allen movies were crude. This one is polished, a great story. Yes, some lines are very Woody Allen, and this is actually a very good film, with a good point, and a nice ending. Well worth watching."
4,Woody' s vision of the City Of Light,"It took me 2 viewings to appreciate this film and I think most of the negative comments about it are from people who have little or no knowledge of the city's historic artistic past (Gertrude Stein, Fitzgerald, Hemingway)since literature was an important part of the city's cultural past. Owen Wilson, whether you like him or not, is a natural for Woody's muse plus the beautiful photography of this city will enchant you. So I would recommend it to die hard Allen fans and lovers of this remarkable city--all others stay away!! I just might pick this one up in Blu-ray."
1,Buffering required,"I was unable to watch this movie, the sound and the picture both halted and not in conjunction. It was a frustrating, regretful experience."
2,Shallow,"I couldn't imagine that Woody Allen is capable of producing such a piece of junk. The film is supposed to be a nostalgic tribute to the 20's and 30's of Paris of the XX century with it's famous artists, writers and film makers,but actually it is about nothing.The acting is terrible, especially by a silly and totally unfunny clown Owen Wilson.All the characters are like cartoon pictures.Carla Bruni as a museum guide is just an anecdote (was there not any proper actress who could act this role?).And what is the story about? For what purpose are there so many art celebs from the last century gathered? A very poor effort, Woody."
1,Tedious is not a strong enough word,"Why do I keep giving Woody Allen movies ""one more chance""? This one got such good reviews, I talked myself into thinking it would actually be enjoyable. So I gave it a try... Just another in an endless line of really crappy efforts that will be quickly forgotten. The characters are all the usual steriotypes and now this Wilson guy is doing a Woody Allen impression I guess because Allen is too old to play the part. Recomend this movie to someone you really don't like."
2,The scenery,"A big disappointment. Did not rise to the hype.Frankly, I expected a lot more from a Woody Allenfilm in light of his past efforts which I haveloved. Feel he wanted to spend some timein Paris so, why not pay for the trip."
1,One of Allen's worst,UGH. Allen can do anything he wants and he has done genius work. Then there is this. Time travel as a plot device for self discovery? Romantic relationship nobody can possibly understand? Paris as a place to save it all? Sorry. Even Allen cannot get away with just about anything.
1,So bad,How could this possibly be nominated for an Oscar? Paris is beautiful but the movie wasn't. Just classic Woody Allen.
1,What.......,"O.k. It started off pretty interesting but later I was like what???? O.W. was visiting Paris with his girlfriend. At night he found himself back in the 1940's or 50's as he was wondering streets at night. Was it because he was looking for excitement? I found this movie boring with very little action. It's a good movie to watch at night if you want to go to sleep, really."
1,too slow,"Not a woody allen fan but the good reviews got me curious. Too painfully slow, rehashed plot nothing new. Waste of 2 hours, save your money."
2,Decent movie full with left wing political stereotype.,"The Good: It was interesting, smart and funny. Not funny like Hangover: full of sexual jokes and bad language.The Bad: Since the very beginning of the movie, they insert left-wing politics in the dialogue. Jokes against Bush, the war in Iraq and the teaparty people appear throughout the movie. The director describes a republican family as rich, materialistic and closed-minded. While Gill (the main character) is described as open to political dialogue and a dreamer that puts his artistic ambitions ahead of any financial decision.But overall, it is a decent movie you can watch with your family. Something that has been lost nowadays."
4,"Beautiful, paced, and enjoyable","The cadence of this film is so relaxing - perfect movie to watch when chilling out, it's romantic (but not like all of the modern american romance films), and visually pleasing to watch; all of the actors have an enjoyable performance.I was a little disappointed with the anti-climactic parting of ways with Adriana; it would have been nice if they tied her archetype in a little more clearly or directly somehow with the woman he ended up running into on the bridge in the end..."
4,Truly enjoyable film!,"Let me first say that I have never watched a Woody Allen film to date. This is my first, and I must say that I am impressed! It was nice to watch a film with witty dialogue and to see such good character development. This is not your average brainless romantic comedy. It's smart, thought-provoking, and beautifully rendered. It's also simply delightful to watch! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
2,Not good,"Very slow, repetitive and boring. Lack wit. Why do you push people to keep writing more? Few and conscise words suffice."
3,It's ok,"Good story line, but Rachael McAdams character in this movie is horrible. She is not the type of actress to portray such a (censored). Haha."
3,Midnight in Paris,the movie was an average movie for my taste. I seemed to have gotten lost a good bit. It went from present day to different era's in time. I am not sure that I would watch this movie again
4,"Clever, and Intentionally Irritating -","A romantic comedy in Paris centered around a young couple (Gil and Inez) about to be married. One cannot help becoming immediately irritated fiancee Inez's friend, a pompous know-it-all British professor - Michael Sheen. (It also reminded my why I thought most, if not all, my liberal arts courses were silly and useless.)Turns out Gil is also bored by Sheen, begs off on an evening with Sheen, goes wandering around Paris, and at midnight is swept up and back into the world of the 1920s. There he meets Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and other big names in the arts.Eventually Gil realizes Inez is having an affair with Michael, leaves her, and finds a much more admirable and unpretentious Parisian woman."
1,Mal Film,"I saw this movie in the theater and wish that I had walked out, rather than waste my time. Cinnematographich shots of paris were the only thing that was not awful. Acting, plot and directing were horrible. If you think for yourself and do not just go for faces and names then this movie is not for you."
3,OK but....,Good but not great movie. Totally predictable but still fun to watch...once. You won't find this a movie you keep going back to but watch it for what it is.
3,Interesting!,I liked the story of this writer meeting some of the most famous artists and writers of all time in Paris at the stroke of Midnight. Let the magic begin!!
5,Woody at his best!,"I love Paris and I love this movie. Definitely worth having on blu ray. Funny, romantic, and visually spectacular. What a great story. Where do these great ideas come from?"
5,One of Woody Allen's Best,"This movie is refreshing. Many of Allen's recent films have been loaded with his adolescent sexual fantasies - and it is nice to have him return to what he does best, neurotic comedy. The casting was perfect- Owen Wilson skillfully embodies his character. I couldn't think of a better person to fill the role. While those familiar with the literary greats he encounters will appreciate this best, finally there is a Woody Allen movie that all ages can appreciate."
5,GOOD ALLEN FILM,I ENJOY WOODY ALLEN'S MOVIES. THIS ONE IS IMAGINATIVE AND EVERYONE IS VERY GOOD IN THEIR PARTS. I ENJOY GOING BACK IN TIME FILMS. THANK YOU AMAZON.
4,Enjoyable Atmospheric Movie,Enjoyable movie you can watch with several generations. Loved the music! As did my 70 year old mom as well as my teenage sons!
4,Midnight in Paris,"This was quite a different movie. At first I didn't think I would like it, but I did. I would recommed it to anyone who asked."
4,Classic Wood Allen,"Woody directed the film, but he might as well have been main actor. Owen Wilson was great as usual for this well fitting role. The film was sentimental, funny and charming enough to make any fan happy."
5,Charming!,This is one of the best movie Woody Allen has ever created. We are charmed by the beauty of Paris. The idea of Gil meeting all those great writers and painters from ''La Belle Epoque'' is brilliant. Oh! I loved that movie!!
2,"interesting idea, two-dimensional characters","The thought of escaping from the sordid present into an idealized ""golden age,"" is hardly a new one. The movie approaches this gimmick with a lighthearted excitement and at first I was happy to be along for the ride. The famous writers we encounter, especially Stein and Hemingway, keep the pacing strong and the audience amused. Still, there is no escape from the utter lack of chemistry between Wilson and Cotillard, or their boring characters. Luckily the scenery of Paris is gorgeous and much more interesting than the principle actors."
4,Midnight in Paradise,"If you like well written, acted, and directed fantasies, this is a movie for you. I was expecting a chick flick and got a fun show of people traveling back in time to meet fabulous icons from the past. Don't let a few bucks stop you from adding this to your library. Great casting also!"
2,nothing special,"I keep hearing on t.v., woody allen this, woody allen that. I like the actors in this movie but aside from that, the script was very bland, I did not find it funny. Honestly, nothing special."
3,"Hate Life? Daydream, it works for Woody Allen!","Woody Allen makes a nuthouse look sane. Midnight in Paris is about a writer who stumbles upon literary greatness in the darkness of Paris at a vulnerable time in his life. Whether you actually believe the man to see what he sees or not, Woody takes Owen Wilsons character and allows him to see whatever he wants and do whatever he wants... and that makes this a Woody Allen movie. I guess it's nice living in Hollywood, putting all of your dreams and nightmares into a reality they call A MOVIE."
2,Disappointed...,I really felt like this movie was a waste of my time. I enjoyed the intellectual crowd from the past but the overall story line was weak. I think only Woody Allen could have gotten away with this...and I normally love Woody Allen. To just dress up a few folks as our intellectual heroes from the past and think this makes a movie is not good enough. The over wrought food for thought here (that no age is good enough for those who live in it) is just too simplistic and certainly not very informative (didn't we all already know that?) I would not waste my time and certainly not my money on this one if I had it to do over. Unless you are a Woody Allen cultist and must see everything he does...forget it. Sorry Woody...
1,"Blech! - Woody, what were you thinking???","I am a bg Woody Allan fan. I own several box sets and have seen many of his movies more than once. Unfortunately, this movie is a stinker of monumental proportions. The ONLY redeeming quality is the stunningly gorgeous cinematography. The actors are miscast (I found Owen Wilson totally uninteresting), the music is horrible, and the plot is uninteresting. Not worth renting let alone purchasing."
1,"no vocals, tried 2 discs","I'm also having audio problems with this disc in a samsung player, as I see two other reviewers experienced. I've also tried two different blu-rays of this title. VERY frustrating! The opening sequence was beautiful...Don't know if I'll have to try the standard dvd version to make it work or what it will take, but I am looking forward to it. The critics reviews were very kind to this one."
1,Waste of 2 hours,I am really not sure why people loved this movie...I thought it was so predictable in terms of plot and had awful acting. The portrayals of famous writers/artists was so ridiculously bad and overdone; it was like an extreme caricature rather than good acting. Watching this was a waste of 2 hours!
1,There's Ninety Minutes of my Life I'll Never Get Back,"VainEmptyDevoid of lasting or eternal valueGodlessSin exaltedSelf-worshipNo awareness of GodExcept to use His name in vainTo quote our friend Harry, there's ninety minutes of my life I'll never get back again."
2,Might as well wait until it apperas in Target!!,"I ordered ""Midnight in Paris"" weeks ago and now I see it won't arrive until after Christmas -- even though it will be in my local TARGET store on Tuesday, Dec. 20th. I am disappointed that Amazon can not get this to me in time for gift giving on Christmas Day. From now on instead of pre-ordering a DVD, I'll wait and get it at Target!"
2,Boring,I decided to purchase Midnight in Paris because of a recommendation from a friend. Perhaps my expectations going into it were too high but I found the movie to be very dry. I think the movie had potential but just couldn't get there.
2,Boring and Simple,"I was hesitant to watch this movie...then it was nominated for Best Picture, and that intrigued me. I read the synopsis, and it explained that the movie had a moral to it; sometimes that grass seems greener on the other side, but life is what you make of it. I gave in, and watched it. My first instinct, that hesitation to watch it, was spot on. Not my type of film. Owen Wilson could have been portraying Woody Allen, he rambled just like him, in that nonsensical manner. People were talking about wine, history, art...the main characters came off as snobs/yuppies, and not very likable. The story itself was very simple. I like movies where I have to think about the moral of the story; this film explains it to you.The acting was good, the locations were nice to look at, but overall, there wasn't much story."
3,Great movie but bad DVD white balance.,"I love this movie but the blue ray I got has its white balance turned so warm, people and the environment are all glowing orange. That might have worked OK on film to be projected in theaters but on at least one of my LCD TVs it looks awful. I'll try it later on my Plasma TV and report on that also. Confirmed. The super-strong warmth makes everyone glow red/orange on the Plasma TV too. I know I could turn down the saturation to make it look more natural but no other blue rays I ever bought were so different than the big screen versions before.Don't dislike my review based on this. It's a clearly technical problem with the blue-ray version of the movie and people should be aware of it. I'm reviewing this version and not the movie content. It needs to be fixed and I intend to return what I consider to be a defective blue ray port."
2,Truly disappointing.,"Nice scenes of Paris. I've never been there. Heard so many great things about this movie. I found it to be boring and sterile. Owen Wilson does whine a lot, and comes off as be an uninspiring, one dimensional, and wimpy figure. Within minutes of the opening of the film, Allen's ""neurosis"" pops out. It's the same old stuff - nothing really matters after all because everyone dies. World without hope or, in this film, struggling to find it. How many times can you beat a dead horse (no pun intended)? Allen needs to finally discover a higher power rather than resorting to fawning over notable, but always, defective mortals. The lost detective scene was the only rewarding moment in the entire film. Bring back Bananas."
3,Well.....?,"First, I will say, that I am and always have been a Woody fan! But I must say that I was disappointed! Not sure why! Liked the story and the idea of it! Liked pretty much all of the actors!....I guess maybe I missed woody playing the lead!"
3,Fitzgerald said it better.,"A lot of charming actors didn't add up to as much charm as I wanted out of this movie.Woody Allen doesn't have much to say--and what he did say was better said by Fitzgerald: you can't recreate and live in the past. And his name-dropping in the movie was just as pretentious (and pedantic! overused word) as Michael Sheen's character's.The characters were caricatures of themselves, though often funny. Hemingway was a stand-out. Rachel McAdam's character was so nasty and shrewish, you couldn't figure out why Gil (Owen Wilson) would ask her out on a second date, let alone want to marry her. And if SHE wasn't enough to put him off, you would have thought he'd think twice about marrying into that family!Yes, Paris is beautiful. That's pretty obvious. And so were Woody Allen's observations in this movie. Probably 2 1/2 stars."
1,Not for me,"Well 90 minutes spent with this film. I had heard good things about it, but sadly, I have nothing good to report about it.Not a film I would want to watch again."
3,Not very convincible.,I knew that not everything have to be convincible in a movie. But I do not feel Gil and Inez can be a couple and ready to marry. I do not believe that Adriana can attract to Gil. It is strange that Gabrielle will walk with Gil in the rain in the final scene. Unless Woody Allen do not know what is love.After watching the movie for 15 minutes I was in the verge of stopping the movie and switching to Yankee game. The motivation keeping me watching it is I like Marion Cotillard. She is so charming and her beauty is not comparable.I will not steal my girlfriend or wife's jewellery for other woman's gift. The earring scene can be deleted. Gil purchased another rings. Adriana said she liked it even without taking a closer look.Most of the actors and actress are superb so I give 3 stars othwise 2 stars is sufficient.
5,midnight in paris,"Fantastic movie, made with love in the most beautiful city in the world. Fun to try and figure out who some of the characters were. Watchable over and over again..music is incredible."
3,Bad ending,Well this movie has good soundtrack and that was got me interested to watch it. I just didnt like the ending.
5,Delightfully witty,My favorite Woody Allen movie. The script is smart and playful on so many levels. This movie inspires and transports your mind to new heights. I've watched it many times and still find myself laughing.
5,I'll watch this one more than once,"This great movie was written and directed by Woody Allen. Gil (played by Owen Wilson) is a young writer visiting Paris with his fiancé. While she follows her own interests, Gil goes to a party alone. There he meets a group of long-dead writers (think Hemingway, Cole Porter, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald). But who can he tell?The best part of the movie is that Owen Wilson plays Woody Allen playing Gil. (Double the humor) I'll watch this one more than once."
3,Entertaining,"This was not my favorite Woody Allen movie, but it was still entertaining and a good opportunity to drool over a glittering Paris!!!"
2,Past His Prime,"Woody Allen is a pseudointellectual who likes to put down other pseudointellectuals and we see it in Gil's rivalry with Paul, as well as in other films. And only a pseudointellectual would think that living in Paris, and only in Paris, will automatically make one a good writer. Hundreds of superb writers, from Pushkin to Narayan to Unamono to Poe never lived in Paris. Mind you, Paris is a beautiful city, but so is Florence, London, Munich, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Kyoto, etc. etc. As for the French being so much superior to Americans in everything . . . give me a break"
4,Entertaining with an enduring message,A simple yet poignant message set in a captivating city. The film draws me to watch it again and again
5,"""Instant classic""","Lyrical, witty, heartwarming, original. The performances are brilliant--especially Owen Wilson's. The music is perfect & memorable. One of Woody Allen's masterpieces."
3,I had not seen a Woody Allen film in years. Thought I would give it a try. Same old Woody.,I had not seen a Woody Allen film in years. Thought I would give it a try. Same old Woody.
4,Midnight in Paris,A movie well worth watching again. The music and the views of Paris make it one of our favorites and will be played a few times I'm sure.The one problem we had with the DVD was that it was zoned incorrectly for Australia. We are zone 4' and this DVD is 3.. Something we wll have to watch out for when we order again!RegardsMaureen
5,Midnight's Marvelous,"The DVD arrived in excellent shape, a bit earlier than I expected it. All good. I had previously viewed the movie on television and enjoyed it immensely, which generated the interest to own it. It was brand-new and arrived in the factory wrapper. Thank you, Amazon, for your prompt, quality service."
3,"I know it's Woody, but it just didn't do that much for me ...",Probably the main reason I didn't feel this film lived up to the hype is that I am not a fan of Owen Wilson. His portrayal of the romantic lead in this film just left me cold.
4,Woody Allen Flick,Owen Wilson an excellent portrayal of Woody Allen as a young man in Paris. Supporting actors do very good jobs of acting as well. Premise of the movie is interesting as well.
4,Midnight in Paris,"This is the best Woody Allen movies since ""Manhattan"" and ""Annie Hall"".However, I have one problem. Both the DVD and Blue Ray demonstratea yellow tint, especially at the beginning with his multiple views of Paris.Am I the only one who appreciates (ugh!) this problem?"
3,Missing the essentials,"If ever there was a DVD which called for commentary and extra documentaries, a movie involving major writers of the 1920s certainly would. Not to mention that one of the minor characters is played by the wife of the president of France. Forget it. A year from now there will probably be a ""special collector's edition"" which offers the extras which rightfully speaking should have been in the first issue. For shame."
2,stupid movie,"my gut told me not to buy this movie, I am not a Woody Allen fan, I think his stuff is stupid! the service of getting the movie was great but the movie was terrible, I gave it away immediately."
2,Just plain bad,"What an amateur written, boring movie even for such a mediocre director as Allen. The only entertaining scene (lunch with parents) is in the trailer, the rest is a digest of cliches reminiscent of a high school play. I wonder if Allen fans ever seen movies by the really talented American directors like Robert Altman and Todd Solondz? Allen's iconic status with intellectuals is puzzling."
2,WA Conceit,"Goodness, this is just Woody Allen' narcissism wrapped up in a feel good quickie for the rest of us. His main character in this flick is a dead ringer in a dress, manner for the director himself who conjurs up the immortals of early 20th century Paris for his own self-exploitation and nostalgia. Gad, Hemingway hated the Fitzgeralds not because he thought that Zelda was vapid but because he felt threatened by Scott's talent. Wish that this film had some talent. Boring."
2,boring and disappointing,Based on the reviews I expected to see a solid film. Three members of my family watched it and we all agreed: It was disconnected and without any purpose. It is a trip to nowhere.
1,Midnight in Paris (Blu-ray),"I own a Samsung Blu-ray Disc Player BD-C5500, the voice track on this DVD will not play on a these Samsung Disc players."
1,One Hot Mess,"Perhaps because I have been to France many times and have a boatload of French friends (who live in Versailles... yeah, it's a suburb of Paris, not just the PLACE where the famous chateau is located).I couldn't get into this film. Owen Wilson is awful, Rachel McAdams' character is cardboard and boring as hell; her parents' are the usual annoying half Jewish-half Anglo uptight rich couple who have nothing but money and are, of course, staunch conservatives.This movie had no plot and I knew from the opening scene of every freakin' cliche thrown out about Paris this would not be the movie for me.If you are interested in seeing REAL Paris culture and authentic French films set in the City Of Light, tryParisorParis, Je T'Aime (Paris, I Love You). Both these movies are better than the time you will waste on this drivel."
1,Pseudo-intellectual sugar cookie clap-trap,"Woody really lets his fans down with this absurd, poorly acted romp through a Paris in the 1920s that never existed except in his own mind. Faulkner, e.g., was there only 2 months and not when Bunuel or Dali were there. And the Hemingway character sits around and spouts quotations from a book he would write 30 years later, pontificating like some pompous, boring literary pope--which he was most def not at that point in time having only written 1 thin book. Toward the sugar sweet end, I expected to see Dorothy and the Wizard marching down the street while Mr. Rogers sang about his neighborhood. And why Woody keeps that surfer dude-faced actor in lead roles must puzzle everyone--but no one wants to argue with the ""master"" I guess. And a 20 second spot where Louis XVI says, ""Off with his head"" about a private eye following surfer dude---well, right out of a high school play. I made it through to the end but only because the champagne of NYE was still flowing."
1,Very disappointing,"As a long time Woody Allen fan, this movie was a huge disappointment. I don't understand what some reviewers and viewers loved about it. Trite, unlikable characters and name dropping to the point of being ridiculous."
4,Watermelon Coctail Sugar drink rimmer,"Tastes good and functioned well as a glass rimmer. They recommend using a lime wedge or simple syrup to wet the glass edge. Having neither, I used pineapple juice, one of the cocktail ingredients, to wet the rim which worked reasonably well at holding the watermlon sugar. Allows the home user to easily duplicate some nice cocktail presentations normally only enjoyed at your favorite bars."
5,yumm,"if you want to bump up the presentation, flavor and aroma of your cocktails, rimming sugars to match the flavor of you drink are the way to go. and this flavor is top notch. i have five flavors from this company and they are all top notch as a matter of fact. great with vodka martinis and margaritas. i make a watermellon martini with 1.5 oz berry cirac,.75 oz marie brissard watermellon, .75 oz sweetened lime juice, and .75 oz pineapple juice and rim it with this and BAM! the aroma alone is over the top fantastic. serve in 4 oz martini glass. get the sponge/rimmer combo to make rimming the glass neat and tidy."
5,works good,I have residents at my assisted living facility that are occasionally unable to go to the beauty shop and this product works great to make them feel refreshed without water.
5,GB128 Great Sounding Speaker,"I replaced an Eminence Wizard in my Blackstar HT20 combo amp with this GB128.I was looking for a great sounding speaker, which the Wizard was, but a little smoother on the highs. Not so forward sounding. Got what I wanted.Using primarily a PRS Custom 24, a Fender American Deluxe Telecaster and a Gibson SG, all 3 guitars shine through it.Overall smoother than the Wizard, which was more forward sounding throughout the whole spectrum, but retaining great definition. On the Blackstar amp, works well either with humbuckers or single coils.Sound is absolutely subjective, so try it out because it is a great speaker, but if you are not happy just return it and keep trying until you find the one you like.PS: also tried a Cannabis Rex, which was amazing, but coupled with my amp, which is already bass heavy, had too much bass."
5,Eminence Legend GB128,"I play blues classic rock and country. My rig consists of a Gibson Les Paul with P90's, a now discontinued Peavey Classic 30 head and a matching Peavey 212 cab which came with Blue Marvel speakers made by Eminence. The factory speakers had a spike in the mid range that drove me crazy and after much research I purchased the Eminence Legend GB128 speakers. These speakers not only eliminated the spike but are without a doubt the best speakers I have ever used. They don't have a catchy name or come with a lot of marketing hype but believe me when I tell you that they are smooth, smooth, smooth. They don't require a lot of breaking in, have a later breakup and the tones a rich and creamy. This is not a heavy metal speaker though."
3,Ragweed; an Adventurous Mouse,"Ragweed is about a mouse who lives in the country but wants to see the world. He goes to the city where an evil cat is trying to kill all the mice. In this exciting story, Ragweed and his friend Clutch must out wit the cat and bring peace to the city."
3,Dissapointed....,"After reading the first 2 books and enjoying them a lot, I expected more of this book. It was intresting learning where Ragweed came from and all but I found this book very annoying. If he writes another one in this series I'll check it out, but I hope it was better than this ons."
5,Adorable!,"I am currently reading this book, its the second time I've read it and it is just adorable. Clutch has got to be my favorite character; she's a rebel, rides a skateboard, plays the guitar, and to top it off she dyed her hair (fur on top of her head) green! This story is exciting and cute and good for anyone who likes the Avi series or just loves animals."
4,"Details, details, details",This book goes over many methods to make an informed decision. I would reccomend this to a person that really wants to know different ways to analyze your deals. Very informative.
3,Let's get technical,"Very technical read. Although the content was helpful in learning formulas and the technical terms, it was not an easy read for me.I foundBubble Proof: Real Estate Strategies that Work in any Marketby Tonja Demoff more suited for me."
5,Very good technical book.,"I got this book for a grounding in some of the calculations that a landlord needs to understand. This book is a good and thorough reference that satisfied me. It may be more detailed than most people want, but I found it good that it is so thorough and deep. I also like the access to the spreadsheets, which are very helpful and useful.I thank the author for sharing his experience and knowledge."
2,Finance 101,"If you have no background in finance, then you may find this book useful. There are really only a handful of formulas that you can use here and they're built right into Excel. The examples are basic."
5,Wonderful edition to my hello kitty collection!It's so cute an,"It's so cute and adorable. I can't speak to how durable it is, since I don't plan on playing with it or sleeping with it, I am keeping this item in pristine mint condition. But it's wonderful to look at and have in my collection."
3,An Artist at work,"Linda McCartney created her art through the lens of a camera. However she then went further creating monochromatic prints using the cyanoprint technique. Her pictures are stark and personal. Some are very impressionist. It is a very interesting presentation of her artistry through the unusual medium of an old technique of sunsensitive printing.Many pictures representing still life, portriats and action photos."
3,lacking...,"There are some beautiful shots in Linda McCartney's Sun Prints. The ancient printing technique often results in photos with a beautiful blue tone, sometimes creating a haunting feeling. While mostly aesthetically pleasing, a lot of the photographic subjects are uninteresting, leaving me wanting more."
1,"Disappointed - ""Mass With Mary""much better","This book is a teenagers view, not an adult realization. The new book written from inside prison with Ms. Letourneau is much better. ""Mass With Mary: The Prison Years"" by Christina Dress gives more insight to the woman, the story, and life for Mary since her prison sentence began. A very worthwhile read!"
1,NO THANK YOU,"I watched Mary Kay's friend on Good Morning America, Christina Dress wrote a book with Mary Kay called Mass With Mary: The Prison Years and it was a great read so I thought I'd read the book from Mary Kay and Villi. What a let down. This book is awful."
2,Frustrating - Not for real inground pools,"I purchased this item thinking it would do a reasonably good job in my 44 foot by 20 foot in ground pool. This item is probably fine for smaller or above ground pools, but was very frustrating for a larger in ground pool. The net was very small and cheap feeling. The unit seems to be cheap plastic. It would not stay on the bottom of the pool and kept wanting to ""float"" to the top. The brushes fall out all the time, which makes them useless.My advice is to buy a much more ruggedly designed one of these leaf vacuums from your local pool store, or online if you can find it. Get a bigger leaf bag in the unit, and make sure it has adequate weight to stay on the bottom of your pool and they wheels actually swivel properly. You will end up paying 2 to 3 times more for a quality leaf vacuum but at least you'll not be wasting your time with this ""toy."""
4,Works good but it small.,"This product works really good, but I did not notice that it was quite a bit smaller than the one I was replacing."
2,Not very well made,Mesh bag would not stay on base and water leaked around where the hose hooked up.I would not recommend this product.
3,decent tool,"I purchased this last year for our in ground pool. I don't know the exact measurements but our pool is about 6ft deep and about 30*15 ish.This certainly isn't the most powerful but it does a good job. We have palm trees in our pool area and the prawns end up in the pool a lot. This helped even with those. My only complaint is that when we went to set this up this year the bag was useless and we had to buy a new one. That being said the bag is only $10 and I think that we got our moneys worth. Only so much you can expect out of a $25 product.I say purchase this one but have realistic expectations. Pools are a lot of work, no getting around that."
2,Leaf Vacuum,"Not as big or powerful as I would like, but gets the job done. Just takes longer and more times to empty the bag."
3,"Not a toy, good tool though","I was suprised how well this worked. It is frustrating at times when the bag detaches in the middle of cleaning and in the deepest part of the pool. For the price though, a good tool."
2,Too dry and way too overpowering salty teriyaki flavour,Could do with a touch of sweetness as the salt is far too over powering and it seems over dried. I bought a box and can't get rid of the rest
2,Ok snack,"This was recommended as a snack, because I eat 3 meals a day and needed 2 quick non perishable snacks. But I did not care for Turkey Jerky.It was not satisfying for me. I ate but won't buy again. I just don't care for this type of snack"
5,Great Jerky,"I love Jerky. I use to order it on eBay and other sellers mainly from Seattle. Like pizza, everyone has their preference to the type of jerky they like best. My preference is the harder type and then I'll leave it in my mouth and slowly chew on it. I don't like the soft gooey type. To me, the hard dried out jerky is the best, as 20 or so seconds in your mouth will soften it like a piece of gum ready for chewing. Being a vegetarian my preference is the salmon and tuna jerky. SnackMasters makes both. I ordered a box of each. It arrived in short time and I could not wait to jump in. You must watch out when your friends come over as the jerky will be consumed in record time. I had a friendly poker game with 6 friends and we went through 5 packages of jerky! My friends are now all sold on SnackMasters jerky. This by far is the best jerky I have ever had and I highly recommend it."
4,Great low fat snack,"I've been buying this product in local stores but over the past 3-4 yrs, it's been hard to find. It can be a bit dry but it's good chewing exercise! I do wish that the packages would stop getting smaller and the price going up"
5,turkey jerky,This is the best turkey jerky I have ever eaten. Can't stop ordering it!!! Reasonably priced too!!!
5,Very Tasty !!!,Best and most natural Jerky available. Minimal processing and better for you than Beef Jerky.Can't go wrong on the price either !
5,Excellent & tasty source of lean protein!,"SnackMasters Teriyaki turkey jerky is a great option for high-protein, low fat snacks. It's tasty stuff & I use it all the time. Just keep an eye on the sodium intake!"
1,Not very good...,"Jack Link's turkey jerky has not been available for a while, so I tried this.It tastes like jerked worcestershire sauce. There isn't much I can add. I'll not buy it again."
5,"Hood Pins....what you would expect,",I bought these for my various 1:8 nitro monster trucks and they are exactly what you would expect in a body pin.
3,broad coverage but not in depth explanation,"It has a broad coverage in topics and gives you a reasonably good introduction as well as some tips such as pros and cons of getting into certain types of transacrtions, etc., when you want to look up an topic that is not familiar to you. However, naturally due to the neture of any reference book, you would need to look for other textbooks if you want to dig into more. One thing that needs a little improvement is that there are at least a few errors in calculations and/or application of formulas (e.g. calculations related to lease transactions), which may bother you, especialy because you are looking to this handbook when you want to have a good idea on whatever the topic you are looking at since you are not too familiar with the topic...."
3,"""Overview"" more like it.","I expected a ""handbook"" to show more useful detail. Not bad, but there are better desk books for the money."
2,Beware,"Nicolosi is a master at this kind of music, and here he delivers his usual performance. I agree with the other reviewer that the Norma paraphrase is the delight of the disc, though I enjoyed everything here. Well...everything except the first selection. There is an extended trill here that came out sounding just like an old fashioned manual typewriter, or an antique machine gun, on my copy. This was definitely a problem with the CD-R transfer by Amazon, not a scratch or other blip, so one would never know there was a problem without playing the CD. Since Amazon will only refund 50% for an opened CD, it's money down the drain.Luckily, some vendors in the UK still have this item in stock, so you shouldn't have to subject yourself to either Amazon's defective merchandise or ludicrous return policies.Four stars for performance, 1 for product."
1,RETURN TO SENDER,"Got this camera, right out of the box defective. Had to returnit and get a refund. The LCD screen would not go on, so youcould not review any pictures or go to menu. The veiwfinderbutton switch was operational so you could view, click andshoot, but could not use the LCD screen for anything."
1,NO POWER ADAPTER,"How ridiculous is it to get a brand new camera for 220 dollars, open it, taken nice photos with it and then when the battery runs out have no way to charge it. NO power adapter nor battery charger is included! How ridiculous is that? Not to mention the 32megabytes of included memory. Seriously is Kodak high?"
5,Proud Owner,"I started out with many smaller cameras and finally got introduced to the Kodak Z650, without even trying i can capture things i have been trying to for ages. The on screen green brackets let you know when you are in focus and as long as you have a steady hand, your going to take wonderful pictures. My only problem is the battery gets worn out as i take too many pictures, but that's my fault. This is an awsome camera, being able to zoom in on the moon night or day, it's was worth my bonus check."
2,"eats batteries, long shutter delay","This thing wears out batteries in nothing flat. I think a design flaw is responsible. It takes only 2 batteries and that just doesn't cut it. I use rechargeable. perhaps the way expensive non chargeable battery would be better?As expected, kodak has that long delay between the time the shutter button is depressed and the time the shutter deploys, ruining most shots as the subject changes in the 1-2 second delay.Don't bu"
4,Camera Kodak EasyShare Z650,My experience with amazon is very good almost excellence. The products are like description and specifications are exactally functionality of the products.I brings my thanks to you for the great services and fast work to complete the orders.
2,Didn't last 2 months,"I loved this camera when I received it and used it a couple of times. Then, it just stopped working. I have since purchased the same camera elsewhere and it is works great. Maybe this was just a bad egg. Good camera, but 2 months of use for the money wasn't good."
5,You'll like it,"I just purchased the Kodak z650 and have taken a number of pictures. It's easy to use and learn all the functions. Before buying this camera I looked at a number of cameras. I picked this one because of cost, zoom, and mega pixels. I looked at the Kodak z740 which is being replaced by this model and for a few more dollars you can get this model which takes better quality pictures and has the histogram feature.A read reviews and a number of people complained about having the zoom without image stabilization. Well, when I took pictures at full zoom, even using the digital zoom, the picture was shaky in the view finder but came out clear. The 10x zoom is very nice even without image stabilization.The price of this camera for the features is incredible. That is why I picked this camera over others. Read the reviews. This camera gets good reviews, even from the professionals. For the price you won't go wrong."
5,Great little camera!,"This was a birthday gift I bought for myself, and I have been very happy with it! My only complaint is that my computer system is not that old, and I was unable to install the accompanying software because I don't have Windows 2000 or higher. Luckily, I had already installed an older version of EasyShare software, and that works just fine. I have used the camera to take fabulous shots of my 10 year old playing soccer (10x zoom works great for this!) and also of my newborn. Both types of pictures turn out great! Would recommend this camera to anyone for general picture-taking."
5,Best Photos Ever!,This camera makes the best photos ever. The photo are crystal clear and the color is fantastic. Easy to use. Love it! :-)
2,focus problems within six months,I bought this camera for my daughter for her birthday. There were focusing issues after less than six months. Since it was under warranty we followed Kodaks instructions and sent it to United Camera and Binocular Repair. They said it was damaged and would not replace it under warranty! After several contacts with Kodak and United Binocular...I had to trash the camera because they wanted $158.00 for the repair!!!!!! We also have the docking printer and now both investments are a total waste...by the way when I contacted custoomer service...it was in the Phillipines. We loved the camera but...what a waste. I will never buy another Kodak product!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Selling this camera asap!,"I bought this camera with the bundle for a really great price. It was the last camera and bundle in stock for the price so I snatched it up before researching it. I was impressed by the 10x optical zoom at first. But, when I started using it I found myself very disappointed. Almost every picture I took after zooming in was blurry. I have a pretty steady hand so this was completely frustrating. What's the point of having 10x optical zoom if the pictures turn out blurry almost every time? I also HATE the delay after pushing the button to take the picture. I've missed many great shots because of this camera. It's horrible in low-light situations too. I'm sure there are some pros, but I haven't found any yet.I'm selling this camera and buying a Canon or Panasonic that has image stabilization, face recognition and less of a delay when taking a picture."
3,Z650 review,"This is a good camera except for the fact that the lens cap does easily come off.I highly recommend getting the next model up that has the image stabilization built-in. Very difficult to use without it when taking shots of high zoom subjects. Also, the shutter speed is a little slow and recommend you manually set the scene to get best results.Otherwise, when taken with a steady hand the pictures come out really good."
4,Somber and sweet,"Somber and sweet.This graphic novel has truth. I remember feeling the pushing weight on the characters. Perhaps the blue color or the art in general just provides a melancholy tone. Somehow even the sweet moments were colored in anxiety. Reads well all in one place, over the separate comic book issues.Worth multiple readings!"
5,Get off the Hamster Wheel,Many organizations have lost their way; trying new elixirs: market gimmicks and downsizing have not cured the fundamental issue. The concepts in this book created a change to my thinking about truly understanding how to improve business operations. I have leveraged Rob Lawton's principles for seven years in every client engagement. Few books get a re-read - but I learn additional approaches every time I pick it up.
2,Disappointing,"The National Geographic name prompted me to buy this book, but I was very disappointed. Yes - it covers the major roads through the park and briefly describes the features along those roads. But it never really describes why you might want to go on specific roads, what the most important sights or features are, and what might happen if you got out of the car and actually wanted to see something.On the plus side, the maps are detailed and list features with short descriptions.This book is far too basic. I returned it within 24 hours and will look for something better."
4,Good,"As a tour guide at Glacier National Park, I found this to be quite useful as a reminder for what was coming next. Seems to be accurate."
5,Like being home again!!!,"To all of us who grew up enjoying Jones Beach this is like a day at the Beach. I learned alot about Jones Beach I did not know, and I worked there for several summers as a kid.This is a very well done documentary on a place many of us love. If you ever spent any time at Jones Beach, buy this DVD. It's like going home again."
2,Pool Alarm (Not a toy),"I bought this alarm for my Intex above ground swimming pool. It was too sensitive to wind and slight waves in the water. It went off so often, I stopped using it."
4,Just Like The Real Thing,need to build a platform for the inside of my Tahoe that cover the gap between the 2 back seats when they are folded down. This carpet was almost a perfect match and can easily stand up to the abuse that my dog and I put it through.
2,Good Price - Poor Quality,Large number of films for a low price but picture and sound quality very poor. Do not recommend. I gave mine away.
3,It was ok.,I was expecting something bigger Thant that. I didn't like the pink whiskers.It would be nice if they put measures.
5,Very Best of Frankie Vali and the Four Seasons,I have always been a big fan of Frankie Vali. This CD has brought me many hours of total enjoyment!
3,could be better,"The first few songs made for Veejay, Walk Like A Man, Candy Girl, Sherry, Big Girls Don't Cry are very good. But the Phillips stuff is a mess. Rag Doll, Dawn, Save it For Me & Lets Hang On are mono & good stereo versions exist. Big Man In Town, Tell It To The Rain & Don't Think Twice - 3 great songs were omitted! Rhino sucks in my opinion. This is for the beginner fans only."
5,great music,"love oldies that you can listen to and not get a headache from. I like this music, it really is music"
4,Everything I Wanted from Four Seasons,This CD has all my favorites from Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. They had a long career with a lot of hits. I intend to feature the CD on my website www.PlatinumPearls.com with a link to Amazon so everyone can find it and buy it.
3,Not what I expected,"In February we went to see Jersey Boys. Instead of buying the CD at the show for a premium price I decided to wait and go through Amazon. Good move except I should have bought the sound track from the Show, which was available through Amazon instead of this CD. The sound quality of this CD is weak and somehow the songs themselves didn't have the same punch. It's boring to my ears. I recently listened to the Sound Track from the show and was blown away. If you are looking to recreate the Show sound, buy the show CD."
3,Great CD,"Honestly, the recent release of Jersey Boys is better, but if you're a fan then you'll enjoy this CD."
1,very best of frankie valli and the four seasons,"I purchased 2 copies of Frankie Valli.The quality of both of them was extremely poor, to the point I could not understand either of them after the first 3- 5 numbers.Amazon was excellent in crediting me for the purchase.I need to add that all other Amazon purchases have been very satisfactory."
2,Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons,"I had a copy preiously of this CD and someone stole it, so I thought I'd buy another on Amazon.com. When I got it all it did was skip all over the place. I usually have no problem with your products and don't know what happened. I was highly disappointed."
5,Brings back great memories!,This is a great CD. It has all the best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. I am enjoying it!
3,Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons,"I ordered this CD because unable to locate it in any store. Due to popularity of Jersey Boys, this group has florished. Delivery was on time--the only complaint is that the case was cracked in a few places. Possibly packing with bubble wrap might have alleviated this problem. Due to being a gift I had to find another CD case."
5,LOVE,"I convinced my parents to buy this CD, and I'm SO glad I did. I can listen to it ten times in a row and never get tired. I'm 18 and its definitely one of my favorite CDs. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind men singing in high-pitched voices haha."
5,"Arrived promptly, well packaged, no damage, Great CD",No problems at all with the order. The selection of music is great. The quality is great too. I think this CD is a good choice if you want a good quality selection of Frankie Valli's music.
5,The Definitive Collection and Good Sound Quality!,"This has got to be the best one-disc compilation of the band that's out there. Rhino have once again done a great job in remastering this album so that the sound quality is very, very good. All the great Four Seasons tracks are here as well as the great solo works of Frankie Valli like ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"", ""Grease"", ""Oh, What a Night"" and ""My Eyes Adored You"". With 20 tracks on one disc, you also get great value for money in addition to the great tracks selections and great sound quality. Highly recommended."
3,Good cross-section of group's hits,"Going through the decades of their hits and from the start, it rocks with classics and memories and singing...few songs of theirs and his that I did not know."
3,"Fast shipping, But Skipped","Shipped quickly, but after opening it and directly inserting it into my CD player, the CD somehow played as though it was scratched. Unfortunate. Don't know how that happened."
2,I think I have a theory of sound quality,"I don't have this disc yet. I cancelled my order because of a few reviews stating bad sound quality on a lot of tracks. I found a similar track list on The Definitive Pop Collection Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons by the same publisher, but it's 2 discs and has no sound quality complaints. Could the degraded sound quality be from squashing the same set list into one disc instead of 2? Since they're from the same publisher it's probably the same remasters."
4,A Four Seasons Compendium of hits,"After seeing the stage musical Jersey Boys, I had to have their greatest hits CD! The music has more significance than a nostalgia ride for this child of the early 1960's. The stage show coupled with the CD gave me the Four Seasons' history as both artists and hardscrabble New Jersey and New York Italian- American kids from the other side of the tracks."
4,AWESOME,Love the CD!! It brought back all the GREAT memories of the Broadway play Jersey Boys! AWESOME BOYS!!
4,Jersey Boys music,I chose to get the original group singing rather than the cast of Jersey Boys. Great way to remember the Boys. Sounds good.
4,Good Music,The products has come home on time and in excellent condition and plays excellent with crystal clarity. Valli is a great song artist.
5,Great collection!,Must have for any Four Seasons fan all your favorites are here. Sure to have you singing along with every song!
5,Great Collection,"I truly enjoy these Songs&they bring back so many flashbacks for me growing up.""My Eyes Adore You"",""Can't take my eyes off you"",""Grease"",""Big Girls don't cry"",etc.. round out this Collection.this is a Solid Overview."
5,Very Best of Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons,Outstanding!! Every popular song from the 60's and even a few from the 70's - all in one place - what more could a fan ask for?!!
4,Four Seasons-'Very Best Of Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons' (Rhino),"Twenty track anthology of the Four Season's work spanning 1962-78. Doo-Wop bands as such has never been my bag. Guess they were before my time. But I have to admit the sound quality here is very good,plus Frankie Valli and crew had some wonderfully created vocal harmonies. Tunes most of us remember are here, like ""Sherry"",""Big Girls Don't Cry"", ""Walk Like A Man"" (perhaps my Four Seasons favorite), ""Candy Girl"", ""Let's Hang On(To What We've Got)"", ""C'mon Marrianne"" and ""December,1963 (Oh,What A Night)"". Also sort of liked the solo hits from Valli. Honestly, it's been SO long since I've heard and of this. Would make a great gift idea."
4,Four Seasons' CD Spices Up The Day,"Having thoroughly enjoyed ""Jersey Boys,""and reliving the unfolding of the Four Seasons from Year One, I just had to hear again the original recordings of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. This CD did not disappoint. Frankie's unique falsetto voice backed up by the boys from Jersey was never better heard. The anthology is not complete but it is more than sufficient to emmerse you into a state of being there, pop hit after pop hit, and the enjoyment only increases as the sequence reveals richer and richer tracks. Listening to the Very Best of Franki Valli and the Four Seasons really spices up my day every time I play it."
5,Frankie Vallie,"Now this is great party music, excellent sound, puts everyone in a great mood! Nice addition to my collection. A1"
2,Great music poor sound quality,After watching Jersey Boys and listening to the original cast CD I decided to try the original tracts. Great music but this CD is what gives CDs a bad name in audiophile circles. Bright (and not in a good way) glaring sound with hard left-right mixing of channels. Pretty unlistenable. I cannot imagine the original pressings sounded this bad. Rhino should be ashamed of themselves. This disc will probably not sound too bad on most audio systems but on a high resolution system ear plugs are recommended.
5,A riveting read!,"This is a book I couldn't put down! Great characters, great plot,great pacing-- this book has it all. Do yourself a favor and buy it today!"
4,Worth Persevering,"This is a very different look at the people involved with the UFO phenomena. It looks at (in my opinion) some less credible witnesses to abductions and UFOs without ridiculing them. It allows the viewer to make their own decisions about the events that have plagued a section of society. Certainly the witnesses are sincere about their experiences, admitting to doubts about their own interpretations of the strange events in their lives.By the end of this documentary you may well come to the conclusion that something peculiar is definitely taking place without being forced towards a view point on the subject. This documentary is well balanced and seemingly without agenda.In a market flooded with tales of Grey Aliens, Reptiods, surgical procedures and breeding programes, this film endeavors to show the larger, more complex phenomena.Ultimately: Definitely worth a look for serious investigators and enthusiasts."
3,Decent Little UFO Doc,"Fairly entertaining, somewhat informative independent UFO documentary, it is limited, just speaking to a handful of ""experts"" and witnesses/ contacties most come off as sincere, but flaky, but when your interviewing people in and around Hollywood, who isn't flaky. People who are hardcore enthusiasts on the subject may want to check this one out, but this isn't a great or definitive doc on the subject."
3,The Best that Never Played,"""Fly in a Pail of Milk"" is the autobiography of Herb Carnegie, the 3-time, Senior League MVP and career minor leaguer, who should have broken the NHL color barrier 20 years before Boston Bruin Willie O'Ree. Despite being referred to as ""the best that never played,"" the Ontario native never realized his dream of playing in the NHL for his beloved Toronto Maple Leafs, most said, because of the color of his skin. Though the pacing, at times, is a bit slow, the book is a worthwhile read, primarily because Carnegie is rarely mentioned in hockey history books, and few of even the most versed hockey fans could tell you who he is."
3,$24.99 for a coffee table cover,This is 100% cotton and requires ironing out of the dryer. It is as pictured.
3,"Decent blanket, but over priced","This blanket is cute just not quite as thick as I expected. It feels pretty delicate, not sure how well it will hold up."
5,Beautiful knit blanket!!,I purchased this for my grandson's room which is nautical. I had his initials monogramed on one corner. My daughter loved it for his crib. Great quality and makes a lovely baby gift for loved ones.
1,Horrid print!,"Must've been taped off a TV broadcast....Horrific English dubbing, 1:1:33 aspect ratio, grainy, scratched . Only purchased it because it's the only available print out there...Hope that's corrected....The sunflower field sequence still amazing though."
2,Seen it once and never again.,"This would have been a good movie if they actually showed the reality of the war. It was good enough to watch at a friend's house and a lot of discussion on the accuracy. Seriously, this is a movie only a war ""afficionado"" would love. With ""Enemy at the Gates"", this one qualifies for a remake."
1,A bad purchase,"I'm very disappointed in this book. The author skips whole passages, and those he he does deal with he does so in a very shallow way. Save your money and buy something else."
1,Didn't work,The card was defective. Have applied for refund from amazon and have bought another to see if this one works. hopefully won't have to keep doing this too many times... have already wasted a lot of time on this. Pretty frustrating.
4,Review of HP 802.11g printer card,The product came on time and was easy to install. The HP instructions were very difficult and getting the card to work was very time consuming. I finally got the HP460 with the card to work with one of my laptops. I could not get it to work with both.
4,American Mystic,"This, the authorized biography, is less revelatory since the publication in the past decade of Merton's voluminous letters and journals, but it is still an indispensable source of telling details, provocative commentary, and precise chronology about the life of the famous writer and monk.Like many biographers, Mott adopts something of the style of his subject. His episodic, often elliptical narrative mimics Merton's prose and compellingly evokes the feel of Merton's life. Despite its style and size, however, The Seven Mountains of Thomas Merton is not entirely successful, in my view, in providing a definitive portrait of its subject.Mott seems more at ease appreciating Merton's considerable literary talent and analyzing his often enigmatic psyche than in assessing his theological and spiritual significance. To fully appreciate Merton's place in American religious history, one may want to supplement this generally fine biography with more recent and theologically oriented appraisals."
2,"Overblown, overwritten, confusing","It's a shame that John Howard Griffith was unable to finish his authorized biography of Merton due to illness. Unlike Mott (who replaced him, he understood monastic spirituality.Mott seems more interested in cramming Merton's life into his ""Seven Mountain"" construct, resulting in confusing chronology.The portion of the biography that Griffith was able to complete was published by his estate--it is clear that his would have been the better book."
4,How does one surrender ?,"A very well written account of the Japanese government in the last days of the 2nd World War especially on their difficult decision to surrender to the Allies.As the Japanese never expected defeat, but as it became clear that they could not win, the surrender became one of the most difficult exercise for the Japanese government and for the Emperor to make. I have always thought it was a simple surrender but how wrong I was.This book is a thriller, which pleasantly surprised me - it has the palace intrigues, asassinations, failed coups, sepukus, plots and sub-plots, acts of heroism as well as treachery. At times it became hard to follow and I had to re-read certain sections because so many characters were involved and so many discussions took place between them.But in the end, it was well worth it."
3,the blue line on the glass runs when put in the dishwasher.,When these Nautica glasses are put in the dishwasher - the blue line printed on them runs....and comes off and some of it remains on + looks distorted.
2,Mundanious.,"Atrocious (Fernando Barreda Luna, 2010)Completely generic shakycam feature about a family who heads off to inhabit the ancestral pile, which is surrounded by woods in which a legendary ghost supposedly will guide lost travelers out. When they get there, they find out that maybe the ghost isn't quite so helpful as the legend would have it... in other words, this is a movie you have seen any number of times before, and you probably liked it a lot better the last dozen times you saw it. *"
3,Creepy little film,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie when I read about it but I decided to give it a try. It was way better than I thought. I did jump a few times during the climax, and the suspense and the big twist make up for all it's shortcomings."
2,Extremely Average,"Found footage movies are a dime a dozen these days, so they have to be really good to stand out. The Paranormal Activity and [rec] series prove that they can be done well, so when something comes along like Atrocious, it's a sad day. The characters aren't likeable enough to care about, and for a 90 minute movie, there's only about 10 minutes of action. Despite having an *awesome* trailer, the film itself fails to deliver. The final 'twist' can be guessed from a mile away.Thoughts? Stay away if you want to see anything new or be scared."
2,Enough with Blair Witch Ripoffs,"Oh brother. First there was Michael Meyers, then there was Jason, soon to be followed by Freddy Krueger. What seemed to be a rapid-fire of the same slice and dice genre has now stooped to the levels of first-person in the house camerman pursuing/being pursued by who-knows-what. Such is the case of ""Atrocious,"" a recently released Spanish film. Not very long (only 75 minutes), you would think you wouldn't get bored, but brother would you be WRONG. You're given no backstory; a family sets out for a idyllic weekend in the country, in an old house, that might/might not have a story behind it. You're given a red herring, and what the viewer does for the next 70 minutes is watch various and sundry people run around lost in the dark in some sort of off-connected forest. I was not scared; I was just bored. In Spanish with subtitles. I didn't find the movie atrocious--just irritating."
4,A useful tool for those learning French,"In my French 1 Class, we used this book and its companion workbook. I found it to be very useful, and an enhancement to my learning experience. I think that --by far-- the most useful feature of Bienvenue! are the French-English and English-French indices in the back. If you weren't completely sure what something said, it was easy as tourte to look it up."
2,Not so steamy,"Compared with other erotica I have read dealing with the smae topics, this could have been better. At best, it was mildy erotic, here and there."
5,Hard Not Love Lost & Found,If you like Lost & Found you will love this cd! Will be looking for more Lost & Found cd's.
5,A Readable and Intelligent Book,"A well written, charming book for a first time introduction to the most prominent religions. This book does not patronize or speak down to children. It is written simply, with intelligence and wit. I would recommend this book for parents as a good way to open a dialogue with their children."
3,Derroll Adams,"I heard of this on Arlo Guthrie's ""Live in Sydney"" album and decided to buy it. Not disappointed and glad to get to know someone ""new"" . It has quite some of my favourite singers from today and the past paying tribute to Derroll."
2,Not one of my favorites,"If I had an opportunity to listen to samples, I would not have bought this CD. I really wish Amazon would provide more samples. This isn't the first time I have bought a CD without the benefit of listening to samples and regretted buying it."
4,The other side of porn,"Overall, this is a good documentary. It was a little more explicit than I expected, but definitely not hardcore. This is a dated title: one of the topics discussed is the lack of work for black porn actors. This no longer seems to hold true with the plethora of black and interracial titles flooding the market. It was good to see the lighter side of some of the actors and Jeanna Fine's drug addiction was also a major subject of the documentary. It would be nice to see a documentary about the health hazards inherent in the porn industry, which was mentioned in passing maybe once or twice."
1,Mediocre and inaccurate multimedia content,"Don't waste your money on the content contained within this CD, you can get superior content on the internet for free. It looks like Blausen Medical cranked this out in a weekend. The text is riddled with typographic and grammatical errors, the medical content is out of date with current understanding of the human body , and the interface, usability and programming is rushed and buggy. Definitely not worth your hard earned $$$."
5,General Hospital Official Trivia Book: Best GH Book Out!,"Being the ""expert"" GH fan, I will have to say that this is THE VERY BEST GH Book out there! It contains interesting factoids, trivia you may have never even know (I know I didn't) and so much more! This is a MUST HAVE for any GH fan out there... a first time watcher or people who have watched GH since day one! Hurry out and buy it today!"
5,Neglected Classic,"What a shame there is no customer review for this CD, so here is one. Perhaps this album is neglected because it is not identified as a Claire Lynch album. She is the main vocalist here, along with husband Larry Lynch. Claire is now one of the true geniuses of bluegrass, but this earlier album also consistently rises to the top of our collection. The song ""Where Dear Friends Will Never Part"" is worth owning the CD, and was indeed the reason I originally bought it. But the whole album is a gem. Claire Lynch simply has one of the greatest voices currently singing American music."
3,Coping With Lupus: Apractical Guide to Alleviating the Chall,"I have found this book to be a helpful well rounded guide to Lupus. From the symptoms before diagnosis to after diagnosis, and how to deal with every day challenges and side effects of the disease and treatments. I beleive it is a great jumping off point for the newly diagnosed. It dispells myths, and give a newly diagnosed patient comfort at a time that they may be feeling overwhelmed and desperate by the diagnosis of Lupus. It is a very easy read, as the doctor speaks in layman language rather than complicating things with lot's of medical termonolgy and anatomy terms. For a person who is looking for beginning over view of the disease it is very helpful. But, if you are looking for more datailed information on specific tests, treatments, or the physiology of the disease one would need to look further."
1,Rubbish if your in the UK,"I brought this product and then two days later recieved an emali from the USA company telling me this product is only available in 110V so i went and canceled my order.When the refund comes it is not the full amount, so i emailed to ask why and three weeks later i still havent heard back.ONLY AVAILABLE IN 110v dont get caught like i did, it doesnt say this on the web site"
2,Leaves a burr and rough surface,"I wasn't very happy with this sharpener although I found it easy to use and put a good shape on the bit.If you look carefully you'll find that the cutting edge of sharpened bits have a small rolled over edge and that the face of the bit is pretty rough. I think the cutting wheel is too coarse - probably a compromise between speed and quality of the sharpen but that's a guess.The proof is in the usage and I found that the dullest bits that I sharpened were somewhat better but that any bit that was only marginally dull wasn't noticeably improved. I did notice that on bits larger than 1/4"" that were marginally dull that you could tell a before/after difference.Bottom line, on bits in the 1/8"" range it's just not useful and I would not repurchase this product as a result."
4,Drill Doctor Review,"So far , so good. A little more difficult than expected to use the first time,however I am starting to get the hang of using it, so I'd rate to a 4 star device. Ruined a few very small drills at first, but overall I like the product."
3,Good for larger drill bits,"Small drill bits are much harder than the larger ones. Unless you are using drill bits a lot, it may be cheaper to buy new bits, especially smaller ones. Since large drill bits can be expensive, the cost of a Drill Doctor is more justified."
2,Drill Doctor DD350X Drill Bit Sharpener,"Extra grinding wheel was not included, as promised at purchase time. Called customer service and got a recording. I left a message, they never returned my call. Typical bait and switch sales method with no customer service. Do not buy !!!!"
2,Disapointed in Ten.,"After all the good things I read about Drill Doctor It was a huge disappointment to finally own one. Its a light weight total plastic tinker toy of a tool.After approximately 30 turns of the handle it gave me a moderately sharp drill bit and a possible carpel tundrum rist. Don't waste your money on this product,instead buy new drill bits for the money you save by not buying this toy.The lager more expensive model may be better? But then its out of the price range for a home owner like me."
1,Garbage!,"I have watched the video multiple times trying to get this to work as it claims. None of my bits come out sharpened, none of them! I have tried multiple sizes as well. The smaller the worse they get. They come out with a rounded head and wont cut anything at all. I went to Youtube and watched a video on sharpening drill bits on a grinding wheel and found this to be much easier and quicker to do! The time it takes to put the bit in the chuck, tighten, place into drill doctor, push in, remove, retighten the chuck then turn the sharpener on.... I would already have a few bits already sharpened on the grinding wheel!! Dont waste your time or money!! Mine is now in the garbage can!"
3,course sharpening,"I had read one review about the coarse sharpening on the drill bits and it's true. This results in a slightly uneven hole though it isn't too bad. It was stated in the manual that the ""standard"" sharpening wheel was supplied so I'm assuming the finer of the two wheels was supplied. If that's the case an even finer wheel should be made available. I'm hoping that after the wheel is broken-in the finish will be smoother but time will tell."
4,C. Williams,"Great little tool and well worth the money. I've been waiting a long time for an inexpensive tool to recycle about 40 years of dull drill bits I've been collecting. Like one reviewer said, ""it's already paid for itself"", and for the 50-60 bits I sharpened today I can't agree more. The learning curve is short, no more difficult than using a pencil sharpener. The only complaint is sharpening smaller bits, 1/8"" and smaller, but most of my older bits are the larger variety. Small ones are so cheap they're almost disposable. I love this new toy and would recommend it highly."
3,Glad I bought it.,"This is the most inexpensive of the Drill Doctor line. It has the least amount of features. If you want to just sharpen high speed drill bits like I do, this is the one for me. Maby it's just me, but I had a long learning curve in the beginning. Once I got it right I have only sharp bits."
5,Amazing tool,This is a amazing drill bit sharpener. I have tried several un-successfully and was a little skeptical about this one but it was definitely worth it. I tis very easy ti use and works great.
4,"gave a gift of drill doctor, he loved it!","Because he hasn't used it yet, I just did 4 stars because he was thrilled when he opened it up!"
4,Drill Doctor,"A bit tricky to use but the included CD made the manual clear. Made a mess of the first masonary bit, but all the other bits cleaned up nicely."
5,Too much fun,"I have owned several different kinds of sharpeners over the years and cannot believe how simple the Drill Doctor makes sharpening.Way too much fun and way too easy. OK, so I will quit complaining and enjoy the fruits of the inventors labours. Thank You whoever you are!"
1,Good luck if you purchase this sharpener,I followed the instructions on the video as closely as I could but dulled 3 drills. I was able to sharpen them using my grinding wheel and a clamp on guide. They were very good about refunding my money in full. Lee
5,Great compilation of early Fito Paez,"Standing at 20 songs in length, this album is a very good compilation of the Argentinian rock artist's work in his early years, before his 1990 album, ""Tercer Mundo"". With tracks like the song to a friend in trouble -Charly Garcia- (""Cable A Tierra""), the tale of two young ones in love (""11 y 6""), a look back at his childhood and teenager years (""Del Setenta Y Tres"") and ""Ciudad de Pobres Corazones"", one of his most politically charged songs ever, this album offers powerful testimonies of the songwriting that made him famous during the eighties and a rock legend in Latin America through the nineties."
3,Pick up.,"I've read Theresa Alan's other books and some were okay and one I really enjoyed. I was hoping that this would be one of the better books she's written. I was wrong. It was an alright book. At about half way through I was hoping it would get more interesting or that something would happen to move the book along. I just found that I couldn't relate to any of the characters or any of the situations that were happening. With that said, I say pass this book up and wait for the next which may or may not be better."
5,Wonderful Movie,This was one of my husbands favorite Christmas movies! We had is on tape but lost is during a move. We looked for it everywhere last year because my husband was ill. He died recently and never got to see it again. I would love to be able to watch it in his memory. I really hope they will release is on DVD very soon!
5,Highly Recommended,"Superlative. Outstanding scientific thinking and a must read for every neuroscientist. A few parts are too scantily discussed, but the text is (overall) of the highest caliber"
3,gaaang,"It's ok. It's the classic drug, dead and sex story in the Brox. An ex- gang member looking for a normal life after his fiance and best friend are killed... and he has a reggae group...*** sponsored comment"
5,Great,"The video was amazing not only in the detail that Maria gave but also the quality. I will state that for the avid wrestling fanatic, she knows how to dodge a question or only give a glimpse of information."
2,Lots of interesting information at the cost of a story,"A lot is happening in this film. Unfortunatelly, it is a bad thing. We see a glimpse at the life in the occupied Russian city and then events in and around Stalingrad. Many characters are introduced but many of them disappear or get killed before we get to know them better. Some interesting facts are presented about the events that happened during the Stalingrad battle. However, they are again presented very clumsily, making the film seem disjointed. The style of this presentation is: ""This is what happened, now get out"", leaving no time for emotional reactions from the participants in the event. Our hero, who's story is mostly followed throughout the film, goes through phenomenal character changes despite years of Nazi upbringing. If someone takes this as a half-documentary, it's a pretty good one, as a film, it falls apart."
1,Worthless,"Harriman edited and altered Rand's journal entries without noting it. This makes this book worthless. And this kind of dishonesty from Harriman is, to use one of Rand's favorite words, evil!"
1,Waste of time,"Ayn Rand lived and breathed truthiness long before Stephen Colbert invented the term. She defined reality as she wanted to see it, despite the fact that reality did not support her perception. Ayn Rand was a deeply flawed individual and this is reflected in her writings. If you are a psychology student, there may be some value for you here in how far astray from reality human perspective can wander."
5,"Too long, but fascinating nonetheless","Although this book does not contain any of Rand's personal journals, it is still a worthwhile read. Most interesting is her outline for 'The Little Street', a novel in which the hero is a man who kills a priest who betrayed him. Rand regarded the character as heroic because he dared to stand up to society. Proof positive of her Niezstchean roots."
4,Not Bad!,overall pretty decent the only one i thought was a complete waste of time was feeding grounds (the only reason it got a 4 instead of a 5) this collection is great if you are having some friends over for a sleep over or just to hang out or even to watch by yourself here are my ratings on the movies.The Craving: 5/5Sheltered: 4/5Hell's Highway: 3.5/5The feeding grounds: -1/5worth the buy like i said it would have been alot better without the feeding ground you can either buy this from amazon or go to walmart ang get it for 5 buck brand new.
1,I was the main victim of these films,"Man I love horror movies but this collection is trash. I'm not overly picky and can tolerate low budget films and find some enjoyable but this is by far the lousiest garbage ever to be put on DVD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$. I would rather of sat through tremors 3 and 4, honestly. Even all the TnA isn't enough to salvage this collection. If I'm not mistaken, Ron Jeremy is in Hells Highway or whatever its called and gets his goods cut off. Yes it sounds cheesy, stupid, comical, BC IT IS! FYI i was only able to sit through sheltered bc I just wanted to know who a cpl ppl were that kept popping up outta nowhere. Not worth it, dumb story Almost as horrid as the other 3 movies. This movie cost more than the allotted budget for all 4 films. Perfect ex. of u get what u pay for. Learn from me ppl."
5,Corvette Flag,"This flag is simply beautiful. It's very well made and it exceeded my expectations. The only downside is that shipping took a month to arrive. It was a Christmas present that I ordered within the first few days of December and it finally arrived in January. It came from Argentina; therefore, it might of just been the country's postal service at fault for being exceptionally slow. I can really say as I have never bought anything before from outside of the USA. Maybe customs are to blame. Anyway --- you won't be disappointed with this beautiful flag. I contacted the seller and he or she was very courteous and helpful to my questions. I highly recommend the seller and the product. Just order well in advance if you plan to give this product as a gift for someone."
4,Very Inspiring,"I'm now using Donald Maass's ""Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook"". Great for the aspiring novelist."
1,Manipulative,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book - felt as though the author used this as a means to further his own career, rather than help the careers of others. Most of his points, advice, etc. are easily found gratis on websites, etc.If you must buy it, buy a used copy."
5,This one delivers what it says,"I have read writing, formatting and marketing books until I'm sick of them and my eyeballs are about to fall out. There is a lot of useless fluff out there.This, however, is a must-read with truly useful information. It gets to the point and makes sense.It is one of only four books that I've recommended and linked to in the writer resources on CCRBookCoverDesign(dot)com."
4,"Interesting reading, although I hope he's not right about everything","This book is put together well, and it hammers home the author's opinions. He believes that if you want to be a commercially successful writer, you have to follow certain rules, rules that can be articulated--and he articulates them pretty well. He also seems to imply that most writers are primarily looking for commercial success. Because he's a top agent with a lot of experience, I respect his opinions--but only up to a point. Let's face it, the most commercially viable products are often far from the highest quality. I hope there's still room for people who aren't trying so hard to follow a formula for success. Commercial success for such people may be rare, but the stories they create sometimes endure across the generations. That said, I learned some important writing tips from this book--mostly about stakes and how to raise them. A book worth reading."
5,Good for serious fiction writers.,"If you've written a novel or burn to write a novel, you need this book. If you're a nonfiction writer or a new writer, wait before you buy this. It's for serious writers."
4,Great book..... But,"The book was very helpful, answer many of my questions and if you follow his suggestion I beleive, I think it will improve your writing and (hopefully) your chances of being published. Now for the ""but."" There are lots of good and even great writers not getting a chance. There are too many agents and publishers that are looking for ""types or formats"" not great stories or books. As a reader and hopefully a writer, I am looking for something a little different...The book is well worth a read and it will help the writer understand the process of the New York agents."
5,Great Help,"My book, Howie Weener Unclogged: A Colonic Noir Musical Memoir, was born from the guidelines from this book. Thank you!"
2,Pretty painful reading,"I tried my hardest to ignore the bad reviews here on this book...but it was pretty bad. I felt like I was reading a scooby doo book. Especially towards the end when they almost literally pull a mask off of someone. I guess I suggest this to dragonlance lovers of course. and I suggest this to mystery book lovers. But if your looking for action or strong character development, its not here. Also while i can usually look past dragonlance flaws, its really hard to accept, not just one baby dragon who may have woken up on accident from its stasis, its very hard to accept that its mother would come searching for it. This makes me think that Mr. Roberts hasnt, in fact, done much research on the dragonlance world, which is disappointing."
3,"Good enough, but not accurate relative to history of Krynn","The book was enjoyable to read and the caracters were interesting, but one thing is dead wrong with this Dragonlance novel: it happens between the Cataclysm and the War of the Lance, a time at which there no dragons (they were gone since a thousand years and more, see Legend of Huma), yet Roberts has put a black dragon right in the middle of his book. The dragon appears and nobody knows that they are supposed to be children's tales, not real beasts, nobody is affraid, nobody find this unusual at all!So much for history..."
2,If you like Karaoke,"""Pistas"" is the spanish word for ""tracks"". This is a cd of music tracks so you can sing along. The arrangements are pretty good. But it isn't Ricky - No Ricky voice here."
2,The download skips,we ordered this music because we love it. But the download skips in 2 different places everytime we play the download. We did not get our moneys worth on this download. We will not order downloadable music again.
5,better than the sequels,"This book was took some of the best articles and advise on drawing,writing, and inking from Wizard magazine and placed them in one neat volume. It was a great idea. It sold very well. Too well! Because the masterminds at Wizard decided to make several sequels to this book. The only problem is that they aren't sequels there the same book! Broken down in various chapters. Oh they have added a new chapter here and there. However, many of the same article and advise are cut and pasted in the follow-up books. Then they go about making this book go out of print. So if you find this book buy it! Don't waste your time buying the other books with repeat info. Or spending more for them when it was originally all in one volume."
5,Holy Smokes!,"I got this book a few years back from a comic store for verrrry cheap. Little did I know it would end up being worth so much! I guess it's gone out of print? Either way, it contains a lot of really good insight for aspiring comic artists. A+"
1,If You can get the original articles or a good photocopy of them go for it!,"I get this book 'coz the original articles were really cool, I mean, you can get actually hot-tips from ""real"" comic book creators, and after years and years of waiting for wizard to finally collect the articles, the comic book magazine, changed most of them to FIT with a deal with marvel, so many of the most good articles were left out and the few that made it, were changed to ONLY show marvel characters!, this situation caused the book look crappy!!!, I don't know if wizard plans to put another compilation with the articles that did not made it in this volumen, but if this is true I hope this time they RESPECT the originals and do not try to change them just because any stupid deal with an editorial; this book is just another one like many others about the drawing subject."
1,"Product is fine, but you deal with this vendor at your peril","This product -- while 50% higher in price than the competition, with no increase in effectiveness -- is fine. But beware if you get into a problem with Wine Enthusiast. Their approach to customer service is -- ""It's not our problem."" No attempt to help, just ""deal with it."" Life is too short and money is too hard to come by, to deal with vendors with this attitude -- I will not buy anything from them again."
3,Wagner: Die Walkure Act 2,"Since I have Act 1, Act 2 was a necessity. It is very well done, and I particularly enjoyed the performance itself separate from the miracle of even having a live recording of this performance in such good shape. Sound wise, it is as good as can be expected, I think."
4,comprehensive explanation,"Perkins offers us a deep explanation of how RTP can handle real time audio and, more importantly, video across a standard Internet connection. RTP has now been around for some 10 years, and has been extensively built out, based on practical feedback from its earlier usages.As you might expect, much of the text concerns the packet formats used in RTP. There are subsidiary protocols within RTP, like its control protocol. Naturally, these are explained, as they are a necessary part of the overall RTP.Some chapters delve into specific timing issues. One, called lip synchronisation, refers to the difficulty of synchronising the audio and video portions of a video signal. Other chapters discuss how to conceal lost video packets. Error concealment is a very practical necessity in this field."
4,Excellent coverage with numerous photos and drawings.,"Four fifths of this book is 1930s or earlier, and the book is not dominated by photos of the rich who could afford photographers. There is a wealth of photos depicting daily life of everyday people from the numerous ethnic groups making up Hawaii's rapidly changing past. The text as mentionned covers not just events but the underlying social, economic, and political calculations made. Many events of Hawaii's past are controversial, and the authors achieve good balance and a neutral point of view. Although it has strong appeal as a coffeetable book, unlike many volumes this richly illustrated, the text stands on its own. This book would be a good addition to a library if it had taken the form of a sparsely illustrated reference book."
2,Neither the best nor the worst,"This recording is particularly notable for its rare inclusion of orchestral accompaniment in the *Scaramouche*. While the orchestra itself is unfortunately not in top form, it's still worth listening to.It is disturbing that Ryo Noda, who composed the ""Japanese Improvisation"", receives not a single mention or credit on the CD or in the liner notes! The last work included, it does not fit the rest of the disc, being neither classical-style nor ""for orchestra"". Sohre Rahbari's performance is acceptable; however, she lacks technical polish.The remainder of the recording rehashes works which all saxophonists should already be familiar with, and there are plenty of better recordings of these available."
1,Smoked and exploded in my hand,"I have only used my hair dryer a few times and I would notice that the handel would get so hot it would burn you to the touch. Since this was my only hairdryer I kept using it, I just changed my grip. Well this morning I was drying my hair, it switched itself from High to Low, sparks flew and black smoke started rolling out from the handel and it burned my hand. This hairdryer was to expensive to de this defective. I will never by another Belson product again!"
2,"Gets hot, but attachments are flimsy.","It is absolutely essential that I have a comb attachment to dry my hair. This one broke within 2 washings. First the barrel seemed to be cracking, such that the attachment would fall out. Then the attachment itself broke. I can still use the dryer. It gets hot, but I can't attach anything to the barrel. Also, the buttons are ackwardly placed making it hard to hold without depressing the 'cool' button. It just didn't work for me."
1,Do not buy,"I bought this dryer, after 2 Months it started to smoke and sparks started to come out of the dryer. Buyer beware."
4,Great hair dryer,"This hair dryer works wonderfully. I only gave it 4 stars because the comb attachment was falling off a bit. Not a big problem, except that it's HOT! Of course, perhaps it was falling off because of user error."
1,Not As Represented,"I was looking for a Hair Dryer with a Turbo Boost Button (like the older Conair model I still have), and the description for this item indicated Turbo Boost Button, but it did not have it. Mis represented!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,An excellent book that has me waiting for the next one.,Jim Rockford has always been one of my favorite television characters. This book lived up to my expectations on all counts and struck the right balance between humor and action. I particularly enjoyed Angel's side plots.
4,Not a bad read,"Very fluently written, but Rockford, the PI who got bad knees, is a really pathetic character. The law couldn't do nothing and has to let the rich doctor go away with the triple murders is just another bad laugh after the OJ Simpson's trial. A pathetic, small-time PI struggled to make a miserable living in LA after so many years is another hopeless irony that we could do without. The story itself wrapped up roughly in the end after a too-long and tiresome merry-go-around plot that also going nowhere."
4,"Nice flatware, elegant setting",Being a fan of upland game birds is what attracted me to these pieces. They are large and heavy. Made a nice setting for our Christmas table.
2,Not as it appears,"this shirt did not look like the picture shown online when it arrived. the colors of the design were different once it arrived. I would not recommend this shirt at all, unless you just have bad taste in clothes."
2,Not Special Enough,"A cursory examination of a number of relatively mild disorders along with a few paragraphs about general instructional methods for each. For a book touting itself as ""how the brain works"" it contains an embarrassingly basic discussion of brain function, consistent with a high school anatomy and physiology textbook. The chapter on autism, while (finally)addressing a true ""special need"" would only be new information to a complete neophyte. This book is a disappointment. The title is the only weighty thing about it."
3,"Good product, no screws to attach to camper",My wife really wanted one of these for the camper so our kids can get in easier... Only problem is no screws to attach the handle to the camper...
3,I won't KNOW without another bone scan,"Since my ""youth"" I have gone from 6'1"" to 5'9"". I am now shrunk. My bone scan shows thinning bones. These pills do not make you feel different or youthen your skin. Their action, if any is invisible without x-ray. The literature on the chemical herein reports good effect. I believe I shall continue to take them. Where is the pill to make me six one again???"
5,Just Show Me,"I don't always need a long technical explanation when learning a new application - just show me how to do it! And that is what this book does beautifully. Verbage is minimal with the accent on high quality, easy-to-follow color graphics which show exactly how to accomplish basic through fairly advanced web design and publishing procedures. For getting started, it is instantly useful and is much friendlier and prettier than the tired old ""Dummies"" books. If you are like me and have stacks of unfinished 800-page snooz-o-matic computer learning manuals taking up a large corner of your office, you may want to try this book for a quick, easy intro to Frontpage. This is the best new line of computer books I've found in a long time. Next I need one for PhotoShop."
5,"For the Beginner, Making a Web Page","I am a rank neophyte at making and publishing web sites. I bought three books: 1. Quick Course in Microsoft Front Page 2000, Online Press. 2. The Complete Reference, Front Page 2000, Matthews and Poulsen. 3. Teach yourself Front Page 2000 Visually, by MaranGraphics. The authors of the first two books made unwarranted assumptions about the level of my expertise, used words not in my vocabulary, talked about things I could not find. I was considering giving up, when I started studying ""Teach Yourself FrontPage 2000 Visually"". Whenever the author used a term not in my vocabulary, she defined it in language I could understand. When she told me to click something, there was a red line leading my eye straight to the thing I was supposed to click. In spite of the precarious state of my expertise, I am now the proud author of a published web site, and beginning to explore some of the fine points described in the first two books. This is THE book for a beginner."
5,Great book to start with,"I am currently developping an intranet application and needed a book to get up & running quickly. I bought it along with FP2000 Unleashed. It tells you almost as much as the first half of the Unleashed book but with much less words. Obviously, it won't cover subjects like accessing to database or Office components .. But then you can go to a more advanced book if necessary. For some people, it gets very basic sometimes like using a mouse or cut & paste stuff that you normally know if you are slightly familiar with computers and word processing (strange that somebody tackling website development might not be computer literate ?) But who cares, it gets straight to the point and you get away with a sound knowledge after all !"
3,Great for Beginners,"I had dabbled a bit in web design for a couple hours before reading the book. It was VERY BASIC and I would recommend it highly for people who are recently becoming interested in web design, but it was too basic for me. I was hoping for the book to have more intermediate information, and it did not. Now I am shopping for another book because this one was not complete enough for my taste. I would not have purchased this book if I knew it was so basic."
3,The Penguin Book of Hindu Names for Girls by Maneka Gandhi [Paperback],I have seen Menka Gandhi's book Full version The Penguin Book of Hindu Names. I thought I would save few books when I ordered The Penguin Book of Hindu Names for girls. Many names are missing even within girl names which were found in Full version.I suggest to buy full version not this Girl Names or boy names seperately. Full version book is good one it has all the names you know and many more new.
2,Sucks,I had high hopes from this book but this didn't meet my expectations. Names were weird and old fashioned.
5,Y si quieres bailar...,"Tuve ya la oportunidad de escucharlo completo, y simplemente es genial para todos aquellos que buscan un buen ""collage"" de musica electronica con el toque del maestro Gustavo Cerati. Personalidades de distintos paises juntas en un disco que explora los diferentes rangos que la musica electronica ofrece. Un disco para bailar, relajarse y disfrutar. Algo nuevo para Gustavo Cerati."
1,Una mierda descartable,"Pesima propuesta desde el principio: como remezclar temas que ya fueron paridos remezclados? La respuesta fue: el consultar con el pueblo: Se hizo un concurso en la pagina de cerati donde se entregaban las pistas claves de cada cancion (comprimida a MP3, claro!), y desde ahi, cada potencial DJ reconstruia las canciones su gusto, y la entregaba a cerati. Si tu obra es seleccionada, te ganas un kilo de zapallitos, tu nombre en el disco, y muchas gracias por todo. Por ser fiel a gustavo lo compre: y aparte de 2 mezclas buenas, el resto es una porqueria que JAMAS debio haber sido lanzado al mercado. Espero que el dinero que se ""gano"" cerati con esta basura le sirva para pagar a los medicos en este momento. Una pesimo proyecto con lamentables resultados."
2,Disco dañado,el disco estaba lastimado con una gran raya no puede ser q suceda esto en una caja sellada espero una respuesta
1,Se le dio igual trato a todas las canciones,"A un disco como Siempre es hoy no se le puede hacer una version de remixes y tratar a todos los temas por igual, fue la impresion que me dio al escuchar los samples, era como escuchar la misma cancion una y otra vez, nada los identifica o individualiza y con Cerati ya estamos acostumbrados a que en un disco, cada tema tiene vida propia. Lo unico que se hizo fue borrar la genialidad de cada tema y agregar lo necesario para colocar el disco en una discoteca."

5,Fits in Nursery,This product fits into the nursery and carries the Hello Kitty theme in lilac throughout the room. Would love to see more purple or lilac Hello Kitty products
1,incorrect pad,The pad was advertised to fit a 1997 Ford F150 parking brake pedal. It does not fit my 1997 F150.
5,better than expected,"What a deal! After looking for wall mounted make-up mirror at other stores I came to amazon looking for the best deal and I found this mirror. Better yet it is easy to install. Unlike the previous reviewer though, I feel that the mirror is actually 7x because I have a 5x already and this is much stronger. I gave this as a gift to my mother and now I'm thinking of one for myself since it ended up being better that expected."
4,Wife Loved It!,"I wasn't that impressed. From the photos I had expected the stones to have a larger appearance in the ring setting.The price was right though -- about $700. I had expected to pay more, and probably should have done so by buying something else.But...........It wasn't bought for my enjoyment, and it seems to have fit the need!"
2,Where's the Music?,"The best part of the film is when she is in Paris in the yellow jacket and ""La Vie En Rose"" is playing over her walking. Where is it on this CD?????"
3,So much stuff missing...,"I watched the movie, and i thought, 'Man, what awesome classic songs... I gotta get the soundtrack. So much good stuff in one place.' Took one look at the song list, and NOTHING looks familiar. I was expecting something like the Wedding Singer soundtracks with all those awesome classics, but this is all unfamiliar territory. I think I'll opt out of this one."
1,Fiona...Annie...Sarah...must've missed the memo...,"A futile attempt to reignite feminism. Note the Lileth Fair-esque listing of tracks. Likely the reason Journey and others were left off. Rent the movie, skip the soundtrack."
3,"Was That My Life, Only Decent song?","But I may be Biased, since I LOVE JO DEE MESSINA!! But, I wasnt to thrilled about any of the other songs, now ""Downtime"" is SUPPOSED To be a Bonus track... Thats also a good Song"
5,"Bad English title, but great movie","I love this movie! I saw it when I was in Austria, learning German. It's a gem of a story and the cinematography is genius; you can't help but be drawn in. The quality is a little lacking, but considering that it's foreign and from the 60s AND subtitled, hey, it's superb. Being drawn into the story, you'll stop noticing the ""bad quality"" of the VHS or what have you. Oh, and the English title is not the best choice. The literal translation of the German title is ""Chess Novel"" and the man was never brainwashed--although he did lose sanity. Anywho, I don't want to give much more away. Watch and enjoy."
2,"One extra star for camp value, otherwise a completely worthless film","Darren Aronofsk'y latest film Black Swan would make for a marvelous double header either with 80's cult classic Mommy Dearest or perhaps Tommy Wiseau's The Room. Is this supposed to be a serious film? If not then bravo, Aronofsky was able to pull one over on the film going public better than Verhoeven did with Showgirls.Oh man, there's this dame and she's all prissy and sweet and then there's this other girl that shows up and she swears and smokes and she's all naughty and stuff. Something about an abusive mom, vincent cassel keeps trying to act (and continues to fail) a few cliche insanity scenes and fade out to death.Awesome.For a vastly superior depiction of a woman losing her mind do yourself a favor and sit down and watch John Cassavetes' film A Woman Under the Influence."
4,"i wasn't blown away,but i did enjoy it,","i wasn't blown away by this film,but i did enjoy it.for me,it was well acted,creepy and bizarre. i guess you could classify it a horror/thriller.it might make you cringe in some spots.if you're squeamish,this might not be the best movie for you.but this is also a movie that really makes you think.you never really knew what's real and what's fantasy.Natalie Portman really immerse herself in the role and is very convincing.and the film is never boring.there is always something going on.if you like your movies straight forward with everything laid out neatly,this probably isn't the movie for you.otherwise,i'd say give it shot.for me, The Black Swan is a 4/5"
1,Unbelievably bad for an oscar,My wife wanted to see this because of the oscar nominations. We could barely finish it. Didn't know Portman was such of a bad actress. The plot ended up so rediculous that I predicted the death scene. Last time we buy a movie based on Oscars nominations.
5,best dvd,"This was an awesome movie. It is so good, I watched it twice so far. It came very quickly after the order. Amazon is great!"
2,I liked this movie better when it was called 'Perfect Blue',While I love most of Natalie Portman's films and was excited to see Black Swan I noticed almost immediately that it borrows heavily (at some points practically copies frame by frame) the brilliant Satoshi Kon film Perfect Blue. The only problem is that Perfect Blue didn't need feux erotic drama and pretty ballet scenes to deliver the same message that Black Swan tries to make. It seems that many American filmmakers are taking storylines from Kon as Inception admittedly 'borrowed' the plot of Paprika. Too bad Inception made a better homage than Black Swan does.
2,Confusing,"This movie was confusing. Portman played her role well however I did not like the ending. You wonder what happens to Portman. Then I was wondering who put the scratches on her back and how did she get hurt in the end. From this movie I got and agree that parents need to let there children grow up and decided what jobs they want to do in there life. There are parents who put pressure on there children to do the same job as them. For example if the parents are doctors then they want there children to be doctors,etc. I think this movie shows how stress and perfection affected Portman's character. Also, competition stressed Portman to push herself to get the dance of the Swan Princes down to perfection. I think this movie is showing a lesson of how stress and perfection can stress a person out and affect there mind. This movie also states that parents should let there children grow up and be who they want to be."
3,Another Disturbing Aronofsky Film,"Darren Aronofsky certainly knows how to make dark psychological dramas: ""The Wrestler"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" were both gritty, disturbing films that seemed almost like documentaries. Aronofsky typically gets stellar performances from his Actors and ""Black Swan"" is no exception. Natalie Portman's performance as the fragile ballerina who descends into madness is wonderfully dark. Winona Ryder's brief role as an aging, broken ballerina is outstanding as well. But the film founders about half way through and suddenly becomes twisted, dizzying, and hard to follow. The backstories of a carping ""Mommie Dearest"" and an ""All About Eve"" understudy are cliched and add detract from the film's success. But stay with it if you can and the ending is spectacularly twisted."
3,Finally Saw It...Wow!,"I've heard many references to this movie, but never anything specific. I had no mental preparation for it. Interesting in parts, insane in others. Nothing really bad, or good to say."
4,ENGAGING CHARACTER PIECE,"This film received an AA nomination for Best Picture. Tale focuses on a young ballerina who gets the major part as the Swan Queen (in Tchaikovsky's SWAN LAKE) but there is an issue as to whether she has the personality for the Black Swan. The stress only increases her mental illness which leads to a sometimes wonderfully creepy experience. Cassel does a great job as the head honcho of the studio, exhibiting a difficulty artist personality who you have to listen to if you want to have a career.Good focus on the subcultural life of ballet, especially in body expressions. Winona Ryder has a small part in this film (yes, she's still around). I thought they were going to ruin the ending but they pulled it off. Portman won Best Actress for this picture and the director was nominated.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; BALLET SUBCULTURE: B plus; MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of August 2011."
2,It was dark,"I didn't care at all for this movie, it just didn't make a lot of sense to me. Her mother pushed her to dance and be a prima ballerina because that was what she wanted for herself when she was younger and Natalie basically cracked under the pressure. it disturbed me but didn't really entertain me. I left the theater feeling like I ate the appetizer but not the main course and was still hungry. It moved dreadfully slow at times but was the kind of movie you stayed in to see what happened. Too artsy for me I guess."
2,I did not like this movie,"I love Natalie Portman, but I thought she's given better performances than this. I had a lot of questions as to her depressed character. I supposed her mother, played by Barbara Hershey, whom I also enjoy as an actress, could be said to have had the most negative influence on the Portman characters neurosis for being to pushy. But overall, the movie was just too disjointed for me. I also think that the ""real"" ballerina, Sarah Cohen should have been given attention by the producer/director of this film after Natalie claimed the Oscar.So for me, this film was depressing and not entertaining. I'm glad I didn't waste money going to the theater."
2,A bad year for movies......,"Sorry folks. I had very high hopes for Black Swan. I have loved almost everything Natalie Portman has done, from ""The Professional"" to ""Beautiful Girls"" to ""Garden State"". But in all honestly, I thought this movie pretty much sucked. The only reason it gets 2 stars is Portman being in it. I found it boring, with bad cinematography. I was very dissapointed. And I find it annoying when the filmmaker shows you one scene that he makes you believe is true, then later springs it on us that it was just in her head. Of course they have to add the semi-lesbian scene, which really had no purpose. The overbearing mother was like acartoon. I was actually blown away that this was even nominated for best picture. But the films this year in general were just not quality. Do NOT see ""Blue Valentine or Winter's Bone, unless you need a good sedative. I mean my goodness, what happened to entertaining us????"
2,Freaky,"If I knew a person anywhere near as freaky and sick as the actress Natalie Portman displays in this wreck of a movie, I would steer as clear as I could from them, as I have on many occasions in the past while living in NYC. I guess this ""sicko"" mentality is par for the course for New York. This woman shouldn't be dancing, she should be in a psychiatric ward - full stop! We will look back on this over-pretentious attempt to be artistically ""inclined"" in a decade and think ""what was that all about?"" Sort of like ""American Beauty""."
2,blu-ray transfer shows substandard film stock quality,"This is a gem of a movie from a content standpoint, but the DVD version looks better than the Blu-ray transfer, which is consistently very grainy. The film was shot partly in 16mm, so is not quality film stock to begin with.In short, do not waste your money on Blu-ray for this movie. You will feel cheated. The DVD is as good as it gets.As an aside, the Black Swan Blu-ray disk also demands (for no apparent reason) that you put a memory card into your Blu-ray player. Doing so makes no difference to what you get for picture quality."
3,Meh,"What a great trailer this movie had! Too bad it didn't live up to the hype. There wasn't much by way of building tension and the plotting was evident to a blind person. All in all, a disappointment (except for the person who conceived the trailer. That one deserves a raise.)"
3,Black Swan,It was not what I thought it would be like. It was more of a mental thriller. It was slow throughout the movie and hard to keep yourself interested in it. It will take watching it more than once to give it a proper review. I would have liked to see more action. The best part was just the one scene when she turned into the Black Swan.
3,Good but not great!,"The acting was spectacular, but I rated this a 3 because I thought that it was too dark! This movie is very subjective...either you like it or you don't! I was impressed with the acting, but I did not like the darkness of the story. The movie was very disturbing to me."
1,A bit boring in an artistic way.,"The film had its moments but they were very few and far between. You,ll love the film if you love balet and lots of it. The acting was excellent and so was the basic script but in my humble opinion they wove in too many dance scenes."
3,Blatant rip-off of Perfect Blue (1998),"Another American remake (by another Hollywood thief) that fails to live up to the original,Perfect Blue. So, two stars off for that.Still, as a standalone film, it was worth a watch. It does convey the intense anxiety, stress, complete dysfunction of severe mental illness (in this case it looks like acute psychosis) very well, so I have to give it 3 stars for that. And even though I came into this film with the intention of hating it, I have to admit that I didn't hate it at all. It kept me interested and entertained, and that's what matters.But there still needs to be a penalty for stealing (technically he paid for it, but I still consider it artistic theft) someone else's work and then DENYING that you've done so. A shame."
5,black swan,"This is a very good movie. The acting, the story and the surreal presentation were great. It does not seem to be a movie for everyone since it is rather surreal but I highly recommend it for those who like to think while being entertained."
1,"Low quality, bad movie.",I am rating this movie low both on the quality of the image and the film content itself. A bad movie with bad image quality. Avoid at all cost.
2,An Oscar for THIS?!,"I watched this movie the day it came out on PPV. Worst $5.99 I've spent lately. I love ballet, took dancing lessons for 15 years and this movie is just disappointing. Further, I cannot believe Natalie Portman got the Oscar for her role....all her character does is react, react, react to everything and everyone around her. She is a cipher. Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis were great!"
1,To watch it is to condone it,"Silly, cliched, repetitive, derivative, shocking, intellectually childish, and worst of all incredibily pretentious. The worst type of US 'underdog-fights-like-crazy-in-order-to succeed' movie. Avoid at all costs."
1,Very dark movie - hard to watch (& understand),"I read a few reviews but just did not expect the very deep, disturbing and dark side of this movie. I love Natalie Portman, and just could not ever picture her in this kind of role. Her acting was AMAZING - she is wonderful in the movie. I just hated to plot of the story - too dark for me and the ending was horrible. I am giving the movie away to a friend - with the warning to them that it is disturbing and not to let any kids near the movie (a sex scene inappropriate for kids under 18)."
1,I would rate this movie with an F,This movie was extremely disturbing and made me feel very odd. The main characters' mental state caused me to feel a lot of tension and took away the enjoyment of watching the movie.
1,not that great!,Dark which is cool. Way confusing had no idea what was going on. Didn't really have a point and the thing I hate the most it just ended. I get it it is artsy and dramatic ok whatever please give me something to follow along to. I love Natalie she is great in whatever she does that is no issue but the movie as a whole was not a must see.
3,Black Swan movie,I found the dancing to be beautiful. The story was a little hard to follow and the subject was not what I would have bought if I had known. If I were rateing this movie I would give it and X rateing. I wouldn't let my 21 year old see it.
5,Portman Finally Does Some Acting...,"I've never been a fan of Portman, but in this movie she was fantastic because she actually dared to do some acting. Maybe the storyline itself was the influence, as Portman's character had to do some real internal dancing as well to fill both aspects of the role she'd been cautiously chosen for--that of both the White and Black Swans.Gripping from the beginning without a breather, this movie makes the most of all its cast, but I'd expect nothing less from an Aronofsky production. Thankfully this wasn't the usual ballet-snoozefest; I never dreamed a dancing film could be so dark."
2,Becomes too implausible to fully enjoy,Nearly everything in this film is spot on until the final act; Aronofsky takes the story from deliciously dizzying to borderline ridiculous. You could feel the audience collectively refuse to suspend disbelief enough to have any sort of satisfaction at this curtain call. A shame that the bad ending spoils an otherwise beautiful and intriguing experience.
1,What dancing?,"I'd heard the dancing in this movie was good. That's why I bought it. There was only a minuscule amount of dancing that looked like it could have been done by any decent actress, so I don't know why a ballerina needed to be hired to help out. Also, I'm no prude, but I didn't need to see graphic lesbian sex. That part was disgusting. Please!And that guy who played the ballet master, there was something about him that just totally turned me off. He was a real pig, and it really showed in his face. Just a revolting person. I watched it with a friend, who knows a lot about ballet companies, and she hated it too, for the same reasons, but especially because there was no dancing to speak of in the movie and the graphic sex was disgusting. Natalie Portman's acting was very good, I will admit, and the woman who played her mother was even better. If that ballet master was trying to be utterly repulsive, then his acting was good too."
1,What was this?,"This movie was a waste of time. My wife and I sat and watched it (she read the Chinese subtitles), and I listened to the English. Afterward, we were both confused (in our respective languages).The director/ writer tries really hard to be cute/ cerebral/ esoteric (in only that way that Weird Artistic People can be), but succeeds mostly in just looking foolish.Save your money."
3,Just ok,This was not at all what I expected. As far as psychological thrillers go I didn't feel it was one of the better ones. It did not have a lot of moments of anticipation. I didn't see what all the fuss was about.
4,Intelligently written thriller,"Very intelligently written film. Entertaining, suspenseful, and definitely worth the watch. It's something you can watch over and over again. At least I can."
3,A bit too predictable,"The only think keeping this from getting zero to one stars is Natalie Portman's great performance.While beautifully shot and directed, the story becomes utterly cliched and predictable. For all the hype and bravado this film had received, I went into it with a ""devil's advocate"" frame of mind. I admit, it was ""enjoyable"" some of the time and kept my interest. That said, it isn't at all the great ""psychological thriller"" so many have made it out to be. I was not on the edge of my seat at all and roughly one quarter in, I knew exactly how this would all turn out. The plot devices fail almost every time.The failure here is in the writing.Worth a look...but not worthy of the stellar reviews."
3,Only good thing was Natalie Portman,I had big expectations for this movie but was let down. Natalie Portman did an excellent job & any praise given to her was well deserved. I wish I could say the same for the movie. It had potential but just seemed to go off in different directions leaving you confused. Some instances you were just left to wonder what actually happened. The sexuality in the movie was just odd. The relationship between the mother & daughter strange. Portman's role comes off as someone that was already suffering from mental illness before she gained the role in the ballet. 28 years old but living like a child. The new role pushes her over the edge and at the end I was left wondering... that was it? If it hadn't been for Portman I think this would have been a total flop.
1,Terrible Movie,"I found this to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Acting was good, plot was terrible."
1,Worst movie I've seen in years,"The good thing is the music, which is still as beautiful as the day it was written.The movie itself is predictable, pretentious, stereotypical and exceedingly gross. Avoid."
1,Don't view this for the ballet,"I was misled into thinking this film might be about ballet and Tchaikovsky. Well up to a point it is but if you think to watch it for the ballet or the music be warned. This is a psychological thriller with strong emphasis on sexual perversion, lesbian scenes, jealousy and murder. The dancing as far as it goes is terrible using cut and paste techniques rather like Invictus to disguise the fact that the actors are not dancers (or rugby players as in Invictus) and the arrangement of Tchaikovsky's immortal music is ghastly. I found this film most unappealing with no merits at all. If perversion and evil is your scene then you may like it but just be sure you are not giving it or showing it to a ballet lover."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"Reality shows, jiggly TV commercials, and stupid sci fi have accustomed us to watching cinematography that looks like it was done by a six-year-old. Why have supposed art films joined the craze for awful, inarticulate camera work? When will this spate of visual blather end? Fifteen years from now all this crap is going to seem soooo dated and stupid, even to the people who made it in the first place. Let's get back to meaningful cinematic language, people! Thank God there are still some directors around who know how to use a camera. Aronofsky's obviously not one of them."
1,"Awful Story, but love Natalie Portman","This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Not really worth the review except to express my disgust for the movie! I love Natalie Portman, but I couldn't wait until this movie ended! It was gross at parts, sick, twisted, confusing, and boring! If you want a good movie go see something that will make you smile like Burlesque! Now that movie was worth every penny!"
2,Black Swan,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
1,Hollywood...get a brain...we have our own!,"This is another case of Hollywood trying to force garbage as art on the public. I can think for myself, thank you very much. Details: not worth my time or yours. BS...the acronym says it all."
1,Nightmarish piece probably will be imitated by girls with issues,This thing was like watching a trainwreck. I hated this movie. I can think of several girls I have known in the past that would see this movie and emulate the tortured main character.
1,Hackneyed storyline; horror story ballet,"If it weren't for the lesbo sex I don't think people would have been talking about this movie so much. Natalie's character is not very likable nor believable (anyone that fragile would not make it in the competitive world of professional ballet). Not an original screenplay in terms of themes and I found myself fast forwarding thru quite a bit. Is this movie about someone buckling under the pressure for love, for work, or is she seriously mentally ill? The movie can't seem to make up its mind.The music is great though. Good ol' Tchai really knows how to deliver!"
1,disgusting,"This movie is a dark waste of time. Don't bother to enter into such tragedy. There was nothing redeeming about this movie at all. Keep your minds and hearts on good things, not this movie."
3,Substitutes Shock for Substance,"Nobody can deny that Darren Aranofsky can use the camera, but in Black Swan, he substitutes shock and style for substance. Using a narrative framework that is as old as the movies itself (backstage melodrama) and cliche characters in thinly-veiled pseudo-Freudian roles (the self-doubting ingenue, the dictatorial stage mother, the worldly free-spirit), Aranofsky uses the camera not to disclose but to shock with David Lynch-like surrealism and suspense more derivative of Brian De Palma than Alfred Hitchcock. Natalie Portman's physical preparation for her role was heroic, but her performance is unidimensional (insecure anxiety). Aranofsky has done some brilliant work before (Requiem for a Dream, most notably), but this lacks depth and subtlety. To paraphrase a former senator, ""I know David Lynch films. I am a fan of David Lynch films. And, you, Mr. Aranofsky, are no David Lynch."""
1,How to wreck a great ballet OR mummy dearest has a nutty daughter.,"Think of all the perverted self loathing thing you can put in one movie and you've got it all in Black Swan. It could have been summed up in a 5 minute, or less film."
3,black market swan,"It seemed, when I received it in the mail, like a black market dvd. It didn't have the usual ""security"" stickers on it and no booklet on the inside of the cover so it felt as if I was getting one of those black market products made in Mexico....oh wait... this dvd IS made in Mexico... my bad hahahaha All-in-all, the story isn't half bad except for the corny bits...yeah...legs bending backwards- made me laugh."
2,Difficult to get into the movie due to poor quality of the delivery (streaming),"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, based upon all the comments and feedback I've heard over the past year or so.Unfortunately, due to choppy and generally poor streaming integrity, there were too many moments where the scene paused (sometimes for several minutes!) or equally distracting the audio and video became out of sync. It was near impossible to remain in the mindset of losing oneself in the entertainment when the medium was front and center (and acting like a petulant child that demanded attention!).Maybe it will become available on Netflix or I'll physically rent a disc - either way, this experience leaves me reluctant to waste money on another HD movie from Amazon."
1,Thumbs down!,"Really a disgusting movie. Obviously required some intense acting skills from Portman, but nevertheless I would not waste another moment watching it!"
2,Morbid Tragedy,"This movie was too sad, though the dancing was terriic. It was very depressing because the main character was so depressed."
3,"OK, rather dreary production","Not a bad movie, interesting to watch, but a very dreary interpretation of life as a ballet dancer. The performances are solid but not exceptional. Don't expect any smiles and giggles or the soaring exhaltation of success; this story's all about pain and depression and struggle, reflected at every moment in Portman's face. The dull, almost monochromatic colors accentuate the somber mood. If I wanted to be a dancer, this movie might convince me to change my plans."
2,Triple D,"Dark, dreary, depressing. I saw no purpose in the story and almost didn't make it to the end. Don't let the amount of award nominations fool you."
2,creepy movie,"this movie to me was bizarre and creepy...a lot of what was going on didn't really make sense, the girl was delusional, I couldn't tell what was real and what was in her imagination sometimes at first. The ending was strange didn't really tie things up. I felt like I wasted money by renting this."
