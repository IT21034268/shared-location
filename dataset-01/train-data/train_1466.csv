5,Wow! Haunting,"It only took me 2 hours to get through this book, yes it's not much of a reader but the mugshots truly tell the story of these people who 6 months to 2 years later would be dead! I highly recommend this book to anyone or everyone who is intrigued by the justice system or capital punishment."
3,Jurassic London,"The TARDIS returns the Doctor and Sarah to London, which is strangely deserted. Trying to stop some looters, they are arrested by soldiers who are part of the force policing martial law. They do not know why London is abandoned, but escaping from captivity, but soon come face-to-face with a Tyrannosaurus Rex.Where did this (and other) dinosaurs come from? Who is behind the return of these mindless creatures?A Doctor Who serial I have never seen (it was not rated for General Exhibition, so Australia's ABC didn't show it), my only experience of this serial is this novel and some photos. Some of the ideas underlying it are good (I won't explain about how the dinosaurs arrive, as that would give away the book...), but the main problem is that the story is repetitive - every so often, dinosaurs will arrive.Malcolm Hulke's adaptation of his own script is quite readable despite this repetition."
5,Sunday best,"Jim Gibson has dressed these hymns up in their Sunday best without the slightest hint of pretension. His inventive improvisations give a place of honor to the melody, which allows them to feel fresh and comfortable at the same time.You might want to also see ""Favorite Hymns"" by Gibson, which treats in the same manner a wider variety of hymns, including some more contemporary selections."
2,Salieri is not Mozart,"This DVD is nicely presented visually, but I found the sound on my admittedly ancient TV to be quite distorted. It seemed as if the sound was recorded at a level above what the recording equipment could take. Most of the singers including Falstaff seemed reasonably accurate, but the apparent distortion made the quality seem mediocre. The dialogue was quite good and the comic acting was excellent. On the other hand, the quality of the music was just not very good. Maybe everyone should hear Salieri's music (origin of 2 star rating) but I don't believe one needs to invest $30 for this privilege. My copy is going to the library because in spite of good orchestral playing and decent singing and acting, I will never waste my time watching and listening to this again."
3,"good, detailed map","A good map but in fact is a little over detailed. Somewhat hard to use for quick overviews, our intended use."
4,Clear and precise,"Michelin maps are simply the best! Very clear, up to date and precise. We were on a trip in Canada and never got lost :)"
2,Heavy Watch of Unknown Origin,"This is an elegantly styled watch with little or no pedigree. Lucien Piccard is a Swiss company, implying that the watch is of Swiss origin too. The fact is that there are no indications of the country of manufacture, giving me the belief that it is probably made in China. The watch is much heavier and thicker than I thought.If you want a genuine analogue self winding mechanical watch this is a bargain, but do not be convinced of its pedigree by the name on the band.Overall disappointed since it is so much clumsier than I thought and it is true that you get what you pay for!!"
3,Nice value but....,"I purchased this watch in December 2006. It is deeply discounted (75% from quoted retail), however you get what you pay for. It is an attractive classic chronograph with black leather band. However, when the watch came the 24 hour hand at the 6 o clock was one hour ahead (so at 11 pm it says 2400). It holds time for about 36 hours without wearing it. Overall it looks nice, but you can get better values for $140..."
1,No customer service,"Timezone123 replaced my first watch after one of the hands fell off. The second watch lasted a couple of weeks and two hands fell off. After repeated emails with no response I have given up on them. If two in a row are defective, then LP must have a manufacturing quality issue. Maybe that is why they are wholesaled out to Timezone for liquidation.Beautiful watch with a classy look and feel. Just wish they would back the product."
1,Bad product and worse service,"Received the watch and 2 weeks later, the push button for dates spoilt. From the transparent case, can see that the connector slided out. Contacted seller and sent the watch back for repair and now it's as good as gone. No news from seller. Bad watch and worse service. Purchase at own risk."
3,3 Eye,Attractive watch but the 3 eyes are hard to read.Watch picks up about 30 seconds every two days.The luminius dial is not bright enough to read the time (the hands do not show up).
2,Not so good,"The watch look's great but just in the early morning, forget to see it at night, even in the daylight it's imposible to see the small dials, i'll sell it for less"
4,living off the land,"I was hoping it would tell me more but for the basics of living off the land, it was good."
2,Not exactly what I needed,This is not too good of a book. There are so many good ones out there. I would not recommend.
1,Motor experiment is wrong,"My wife got this book when homeschooling and my daughter picked out the motor experiment. We followed the directions but could not get the motor to work. After looking at the design I realized the armature winding was incorrect. The winding must go around the cork in parallel with the axis, not around the axis. Needless to say a child trying to build this would be extremely frustrated. I have a feeling the author did not build all the experiments. The lack of explanation of how the motor works is also a drawback."
2,"Not scientific, but a 'cookbook' of entertaining activities","The activites in this book are enjoyable for children to perform, but there is very little science taught.My daughter very much enjoys performing the activities listed, however, I need to heavily supplement the material and description given in order to provide any scientific explaination of what she is doing. Additionally, the scientific method is completely missing from the 'experiments.' The simple activites are prsented in a ""do it and observe"" form, with no specific idea or result which is tested by the activity.A good book for entertaining activities, but not for teaching science."
5,Simply Magnificient!,I loved it! The experiments are so much fun! They were interesting and fascinating! A *Must* for any scientific youngster.
3,Small booklet not a real book.,The information in this booklet is not detailed when it comes to minerals. It mostly covers vitamins. It's okay but not highly recommended.
2,Adequate but spend a little more to get better quality,Well...I've never own a babyliss but heard that it's a great brand in europe. Gave it a try...it's nothing like Chi or Hai....The quality is more similar to revlon or conair. I'm keeping it because I don't want to deal with returning. If you're considering this item....do some research but you buy. I think there's a better one out there.
3,hot flat iron that snags,"This products gets very hot, but snags your hair. You have to be very careful using this product, or it will tear your hair."
3,The Emperor has more new clothes,"Eno's work sounds increasingly like someone running as fast they can without moving. His new work is a decisive step to a more accessible sound, and is very proficient and pleasant listening. I suppose his 'ambient' work does ironically require some concentration to reap full rewards, which is why people keep listening. Me? I'm beginning to feel he hasn't much more to say."
4,Pomo Hphp Glideslide,"I wonder what's turned Eno toward space jazz. Too much time on the autobahn? The sickly romance of St. Petersburg's future? Lovely decadence as panacea? Although I prefer the purer ambience of releases like On Land, Thursday Afternoon, and The Shutov Assembly, I can't fault Eno for reaching again (as he always does, but in different directions each outing), but I find the vocorder cheesy, Schwalm all but extraneous, some of the guitar sounds a bit too obviously Frippish, and, in general, a bit too much use of things from the old bag of tricks. Of course, they are mostly tricks he invented, so I really can't complain. Eno's truest gift is here (again as always) in the music's ability to travel and chart a subconscious terrain, sometimes seashore, sometimes highway, sometimes cityscape, always Eno's own avant garde."
2,A sleepy decline into the ambient spaces of Grandma's sofa,"I've been a listener/fan since 1974. Good lord, this is the same old salad he's been tossing for 10 years now, enlivened only by the employment of a different spice: bass on one album; percussionist on another; repeat, etc.He can't even muster up enthusiasm for titles anymore. These look like they were lifted from a Kitaro album. Sorry."
5,Old and new,"This album goes where Eno has been unwilling to go since, oh, ""Music for Films"" and his earlier rock career -- into the dangerous realm of the pretentious and dramatic. It isn't ambient any more ... it's music to actually listen to, for its sharp peaks and valleys, tensions and resolutions. Eno has always brought a remarkable mind to his music ... but here, for the first time in a long time, it feels reunited with a heart. I like it a lot."
5,Very good stuff!,"This microwavable dipping chocolate has just the right consistency and flavor and couldn't be easier to enjoy. It's the best product of its kind that we've tried for both taste and texture - Also, fun and easy for the kids to use as a special treat, with the added benefit of all the fresh fruit they consume in the process. No mess to clean up afterward either. I have had a hard time finding this in the grocery stores though, which is why we recently ordered a case of it online. We keep ours hidden in my husband's workroom!"
5,Outstanding Printer,This printer really does a great job. It is nice to have individual color. The black for printing documents is larger the others. That is a good touch. The best thing after the great printing I like is the two paper feeds. This really save on the photo paper. Overall I'm very happy with our printer.
4,pixma ip4300 photo printer,Good product. Printing photos is a little slow but color is good. Final product looks great.
2,Dies soon after 1 year warranty,"I am frustrated with this printer and many others. They seem to die on me soon after the 1 year warranty is past. Printer says yellow ink tank is out when, in fact, it is full, and it's the second new tank I've tried. Every print job stalls: I have to open the cover, reset the tank and start again. I read online that soon it will die completely. Customer service suggests taking it for diagnostic review at unknown cost--closest place is 1 hour drive. And then to replace the print head would be almost as much as a new printer. This is apparently a common problem.Quality of prints was very good but I am so annoyed with the planned obsolescence on these products, especially considering how expensive it has been to keep replenishing ink tanks."
1,Don't Buy it,"I bought this, within a month the print head went out.Canon replaced it.Now, I have had it over a year, and it has stopped working.It says:Document printing cannot be executed because the paper output tray is closed.But the paper output tray is open.I don't know where to get it fixed, or if it is worth it.Maybe I will have to throw this one out and buy a new one.Problem is, I have bought cartridges for this unit."
2,Driving me crazy,I have been battling the yellow ink cartridge from day one. It refuses to work. I have replaced it and that pesky chip still doesn't register 75% of the time so nothing will print at all. It's positively infuriating. When it does actually print it works fine- quick and clear- but it takes at least 20 minutes to get started.
5,Outstanding Printer,This printer is amazing. Where else can you find a printer that will print on both sides of the page? Could not be happier with the printer and with the service from Amazon. It was delivered overnight - without any special request - and it was free !! The price was as good as I could find anywhere. I could not find this printer anywhere locally so I was happy to get it so quickly from Amazon.
5,LOVE IT,LOVE THIS PRINTER. IT WORKS. IT IS SO SIMPLE AND RELIABLE. NICE LOOKING.PICTBRIDGE ALSO. JUST GREAT SO FAR
4,Excellent all-around printer,"The iP4300 is super-fast on black & white text and has great quality on photos. Be sure to tell it what type of paper you are using. I mostly print high-quality graphics and text, but on occasion like to print photos at home rather than uploading them. This printer does well at both. The only con I see so far is its relatively large size and the cost of cartridges (cartridges are expensive no matter what these days...)"
5,No complaints,"Inexpensive to buy (but, like any inkjet, not to operate), fast, easy to use, attractive (if you keep the various doors closed). I love the duplexing feature--being able to print to the front and back of a page saves trees and make for thinner printouts."
2,Can't print text with black only,"It's a nice printer--until it thinks a cartridge is low. The magenta is half-full but it says its empty. I only want to print black and white, not color, but it won't allow me to print b/2 until I replace the magenta (in other printers, you can choose to use the black and white or the color).It does a great job of printing, but pretty expensive upkeep if I have to keep replacing color cartridges so I can print black and white text."
4,Canon makes another good printer,"I mostly use this printer to print text and Internet graphics. It prints quickly and clearly. Having 2 paper trays saves me from constantly switching paper. I use the bottom tray for paper that I use most often. I use the top tray for special jobs, like envelopes. Although I did not buy this printer to print photos, it does an excellent job. I printed a 8x11 photo that looks like it came from a professional photo lab. The printer also looks good on my desk. When it's closed, the printer looks like a sleek black box. I didn't give 5 stars, because the printer is larger than I would prefer. I recommended this printer to a family member, and he loves it."
5,exceeded expectations,"Thinking that this might be a reasonable ink jet printer with separate cartridges, I tried it. I wasn't expecting much in terms of print quality - just something to handle the occasional need for color i.e. I wasn't expecting magazine quality photo printing.WHAT a SURPRISE this turned out to be. It prints beautifully and FAST. It has two paper sources; I use one for good paper and the other for recycled (print on the back side) paper. It cleans itself and parks the cartridge carrier after a few minutes of non-use; so, you can leave it ""on"" all the time, if you like; it doesn't consume any power (I measured it.) when unused. The cartridges are nice and big - not the thumb-size of HP. Everything folds up into a nice sealed box - to prevent dust from collecting during non-use.I'm delighted with it ... `couldn't be happier. Yes, I would buy one, again, without even thinking about it."
4,"good, fast, expensive printing","Brochure printing is relatively fast. Print quality is good. Ink cost is relatively high. You pay extra for the ink cartridge to have a light in it........ and whenthe printer decides that the ink is low, it stops printing. period. You CANNOT print until the ink runs out. Every time I've had to change the ink, there is still visable ink left in the tank."
1,My first and my last Canon printer,"I will never buy another Canon printer. I've always had HP printers in the past and had good luck with both a laserjet and an inkjet. Then I got this piece of junk. Like other reviewers, I had problems with the ink cartridges (won't print if one is low) and the paper output tray. My only consolation was that even though I thought my Pixma was a worthless piece of junk, I got a $50 credit for it when I traded it in for a new HP printer."
2,Doesn't live up to expectations,"I bought this printer because I had read good reviews on it. However, I've had it for maybe a few months. Every time I turn it on it gives me an ink error. I have to open it up and just re insert the ink cartridges for no apparent reason. There is nothing wrong and it just keeps doing it. Sometimes even when I leave it on it does it at random times.I also think it is stupid that I could buy a brand new printer with a full set of ink for less than it cost me to replace the ink in the printer."
1,Still have not received product,"Terrible! Ordered on Aug 7th and still have not received. Have a feeling Amazon is selling product that they do not have. Make sure yourpurchase is in stock. Amazon's prices are great, but one can sell product they do not have for any price!"
4,Pixma ip4300 use it while it works,"This is an awesome Printer the ink the photos are lab quality without question. The sofware is so so, but who care use your own. Use this machine as much as you can all the time because after three years if your lucky enough that it last that long. I went through only two sets of inks in two years and one day it just would go on. Nothing! with full inks in it I had just replaced. I called Canon and they told me that they only last two to three years. Then you call them and they give you a great deal on a refurbished printer wioth two day free shipping. Thanks canon, for nothing."
1,Bum printer OR Seller who's a bum,"I ordered this printer because it's exactly what I had already and we didn't know if it needed a new part or was dead. But, even though this was used but 'hadn't run in awhile', it didn't print. When I contacted the seller, he said he had personally checked it had it ran ""perfectly"". BULL!! My IT finally found some cleaning solution online and now both printers run perfectly. As for the seller, he told me to use Canon cartridges only- which I already did- and made no other overtures or responses to compensate me for the Bum printer he sent for $96."
1,Piece of carp,It broke after 2 weeks of use.Canon recalled the item and replaced it with the awesome i4600.
2,After 7 months - belly up,I bought this printer based on its good reviews. It does print beautiful photos BUT I haven't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon. Canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only. The problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly. After several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual I contacted Canon. They ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body.
4,Great Printer,"This is a great printer that I've been using lightly for over 2 years. Printing speed is pretty good and I like the auto on and off feature. CD/DVD printing is really nice too. Photo paper prints are also very good. I did not give five stars because of one annoyance. Apparently the ink cartridges have an IC chip on them that can go bad! With the first set of cartridges, my printer would print fine one minute and fail to find the yellow ink when I try to print next. Removing and reinserting the cartridge would sometimes cause the printer to work again but the only real fix is to replace the faulty cartridge.Also if the chip goes bad with a full cartridge like mine, the ink just goes to waste. This has only happen once in the two years that I have had the printer though but I have only gone through maybe 2-3 sets of ink cartridges in that time."
4,"speedy delivery, speedy printer","We love the printer and it arrived in 2 days from when we placed the order. The footprint is a bit big, but it's the only printer we need now. Love the duplexing and multiple paper areas."
3,Noisiest printer I have ever encountered,"I was convinced to buy the 4300 because of the glowing reviews that I had seen and have been very disappointed in its performance. Specifically, I have been unable to generate printed pictures that match the color of an original digital picture. While some of the issue is with personal taste, my old HP printer can produce replicas of the original that was printed commercially.A second more irritating issue is with the amount of noise the printer makes when warming up, warming down, and seeming adjusting the print head location. The noise just continues for at least a couple of minutes after the printing has been completed. I would certainly not recommend this printer. I just keep reminding myself that it was not very expensive."
3,Wish I liked it better,"I've had the printer for over a year now. It prints good and crisp. Nothing to complain about that. Works great with my Mac, too. But there is one gripe that I'll mention. When I put something in the queue to print, the printer does this ""pre warmup"" routine. Little motors start a turnin'. Whirring, whirring and more whirring. 30-40 seconds later, it's ready and actually starts to print the document. Then if you print another document, it loads up and prints without the buzzing and whirring. But if you turn off the printer, expect to wait another 30-40 seconds when you press print.Can I person wait that long? How long does his sanity last? I wish I liked the printer more. It hasn't failed me yet. But waiting so long to print a document is tiresome."
1,Weak Software/Driver,The software and driver installation requires that the printer be direct USB attached. This precludes this printer from any type of USB-to-Ethernet connectivity for print sharing. I wish I knew this before I purchased an ip4300.
4,Great while it lasted!,I got this printer free when I purchased my MacBook. It has always produced quality printing jobs but recently would not turn on. I've researched this problem and apparently there is nothing you can do to fix it. I have had this printer for almost 5 years and use it every so often. It was great while it lasted but I will be purchasing something different because of the increase in price.
3,Solid printer while it lasted,"We owned this printer for about 4 years then it died with a paper jam error. We have searched carefully and there is no jammed paper. We tried using dust off to clean it to make sure there was not any dust in the way of the paper jam sensor but we could not get the error to go away so we could print. Photo print quality was good. The other downside is that there is no scanner attached. I am happy with how long it lasted overall, I just wish it still worked now."
4,ENGROSSING + EXOTIC,"THIS MOVIE TELLS OF A SUCCESSFUL AND ""LOOSE"" YOUNG WOMAN WHO SUDDENLY LEARNS OF HER BROTHER'S SUICIDE. SHE RETURNS HOME TO TRY TO FIND A REASON THAT DROVE HIM TO IT."
2,Bleak...,"A rather unusual approach to filming a drama. The sequences appear in a chronological order but presented from different angles of involvement in this murder/kidnapping case. The movie is slow and bizarre. I'm very familiar with the civil war in former Yugoslavia where all of this is happening, but even with understanding of the events that took place back then I still dislike the movie."
1,I would recommend a different book,"I have been practicing numerology for years and found this book confusing. His perspective in not new; he just seemed to rename concepts that I already know. His layout of each chapter was difficult to read. He would combine the concept, the introduction and examples in one paragraph. I prefer to read numerology books that have a breakdown with the chapter stating a concept, introducing the concept, then show where to get the math and doing the math, show one or two examples, and finally show what each number means in that concept. His number definitions were good but it was too much work trying to figure out which concept he was working with. I would recommend Numerology: The Romance in Your Name by Judy Juno is a great introduction book for those who want to get started. OR Numerology has your Number by Ellen Dodge is another good one.I have many more, but these ones are books every numerologist should own or start with."
4,Wonderful Double Digit Information,"Unlike other numerology books this book focused a lot of attention on the double digit before reducing to the single digit. The information gleaned from this process was very informative and interesting. In fact I felt it was one of the most informative books on the subject that I have read.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the way numbers are used for prediction. If you were born with a 3 birth path why do you become your birth month + birth date + whatever the year is? In my opinion (and what seems to make more sense) if your path is a 3 (and to stay on that path) you need to add 3 + the current year = peresonal year(x), x + current month = personal month (y), y + the current day = personal day. You are the number you were born with. The date of the year you were born is part of what you are. Why is that left behind when configuring numbers in prediction? It works, try it. I would love to read a book with this type of prediction. Open to recommendations."
1,Forget it!,I am very concerned with the other high ratings. I have never been so discouraged as I was reading this book. I will never recommend this to any of my friends
2,Newmerology????,"I have always been intriqued by Numerology, and after reading the reviews, I rushed out to buy this book. Sadly to say, I was disappointed. Don't waste your money. Nothing new here. I found Dan Millman's LIFE YOU WERE BORN TO LIVE, and Carol Adrienne's THE NUMEROLOGY KIT much more enlightening and useful."
3,"Good Coffee, Behaves Strangely","We've used this coffee maker on several car-camping trips and at home on the stove. It creates a good, quality cup of coffee. We have had trouble getting the coffee to come out without sputtering and spraying coffee all over. It also seems to go through a phase of ""making coffee"" and ""sputtering"" coffee several times before completing its job. We've tested this on our stove at home, so it does not seem to be a function of uneven heating.Ultimately, we'd love to take this on backpacking trips, but with the difficulty controlling the output of the coffee, its not quite ""leave no trace"" -- nor advisable in areas with bears or other potentially dangerous animals. For that, I suppose, we are again relegated to the realm of instant coffee.But, for getting my caffeine fix for low-key car style camping events, its perfect!"
4,Good nutritional value,Increases nutritional value of soups and smoothies and tastes almost like nuts.
3,These Guys Follow The Gothic Rule Book Too Much,Corpus Delicti were a French gothic rock band during the 1990's. These guys obviously know the gothic rock rule book inside and out. They sound like a cross between Bauhaus and Siouxsie and The Banshees. The singer sounds a lot like Peter Murphy. My problem is that they play by the rules without thinking outside of the box. Their music is 1980's Gothic Rock 101. I wish they had experimented more with their music. Every song that is on here is nothing out of the ordinary for typical gothic rock. There are three songs on the album that I really like:Noxious (The Demon's Game)SarabandPatientThe others are nothing special.
4,Please Ignore Other Review,"This mini-album was released a full year before the non-stop erotic cabaret recording. These are NOT remixes but original versions of the songs, which were then retooled for the album release. This CD contains a great version of what, and a favorite song of mine, insecure me, which is unavailable elsewhere. But anyway, I just wanted to set the record straight and inform y'all that this is NOT a remix album, but an original issue mini-album..."
1,ingredient mystery,It seems impossible to find out what ingredients the soap *does* contain. The full list of ingredients is not available on the Nature's Plus website either.
3,Gentle & natural but not moisturizing nor a good scent and pretty gunky,"PROS: I am trying to go natural with all of the products that I use on my body and so the fact that this cleansing bar has two simple ingredients is pretty great. It was even non-irritating in more intimate areas, so the gentleness is top of the line. Also, it lasted a pretty long itme.CONS: Several things annoyed me. 1.Ideally I would like to enjoy the scent of my soap, but I'm willing to take a hit on this for the sake of being natural. But this not only fails to provide a nice scent, but it actually provides an irksome scent. (note: there are natural soaps with a nice scent so this trade off is unnecessary) 2. This soap is MESSY. For example, if I used the soap for a quick face wash, there would be yellow gunk all over my sink and faucet. 3. It is not great for shaving. My legs would be kind of dry after shaving with this soap and I normally shave with soap."
3,too small,I purchased this item to carry my 8 lb. cat in. It is way too small! Looks way larger in the photo. I think maybe you could fit a hampster in it. I guess I should have gotten a clue when it gave the weight. I must say it is made very well.
1,Check the pages before you use.....,"General speaking, the book is good with alot of details for control and DA process, the reason I gave it 1 star is after some time of using the book, I reached a chapter which I didnt read before, and I discovered 30 missing pages with 30 others repeated, the replacment was also defected, I think the publisher should have fixed the problem by now."
2,I'm not saying it sucks but............,If you've never heard of Buck O Nine then this CD might interest you but if your a fan then I don't suggest buying it because it will be a let down. The songwriting is still good but they have lost their edge.
4,Well worth the cash.,"This CD has its up and its downs but overall youll like it. The tracks are filled with up beat horns and guitar riffs. the best song on the album is defenitly ""Here We Go Again"". But thats just my opinon. Buck-o-Nine is a change, if your looking for something that has an edge and you got the cash then go for it."
4,uniquness in the midst of adversity,"I am extemely disaapointed in the negative reviews of this cd. This cd is an aweosme Buck09 cd and should be collected by all buck09 and ska fans alike. Libido brings a more melodic mellowier and much more mature sound to Buck09...many of the tunes show that Buck09 has finally reached a point in there careers where they no longer need to prove anything to anyone, there place in history is set. So Libido brings a more relaxed mood to your speakers...with a reggae/rock/ska mix BuckO9 shows there expeirence and eclectic range of music. Libido in my eyes will always be looked at a nice ""icing on the cake"" to a group of awesome guys and wonderful musicians who have reached the top and are enjoying the view."
5,Crazy Super Stuff,"Oh, my goodness. It's about time this album came out. I've been waiting forever. This is a great album, all the songs are great, and it was worth the wait. Everyone should like it."
5,I like the new one just as much as 28 teeth,"Hey, no matter what it is, as long as it sounds good.. WhO CaReS????? heh, i like it a lot, finally something else from them, i almost got tired of 28teeth (previous release) but now ive got something else to MEMORIZE!"
4,Big band sound with a youthful theme,The bands album is a cross between big band brass sound music mixed with a youthful theme. The music can cross over the generation gap. I am in my late 40's and liked the music. I really liked the sound tracks #1 & #13. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the big sound and some interesting lyrics.
4,Big band sound with a youthful sound.,The big band sound with a youthful rebel theme. I think some song will cross the generation gap. Giving people a taste of big band brass sounds and with good youthful themes. I recommend the album and I am in my late 40's. I think the younger generation will really like the words to the sound tracks. My personal favorite tracks are #1 & #13.
2,Buck O Nine trying to reach a larger audience - they lost me,"Libido is a lame attempt to disseminate the band from the deluge of ska. Gone is the fast, fun, edgy BON. Enter the bland watered down ready for mainstream radio BON. With the exception on Falling Back to Sleep and maybe Who are they the rest can go into pop music oblivion. Time to put on the old stuff and remember when......."
4,"Helpful, Clever, Fun","This is a great guide for anyone, no matter how internet savvy you are (or aren't). Very easy to find exactly what kinds of sites you're looking for, with clever, smart summaries. Also gives lots of helpful hints for navigating the internet in general."
3,Internet Savvy in a SIlver Clad Bundle,"The book is the first that I have seen that comfortably guides a person with multiple talents, tasks and hobbies to surf the net. If I hadn't been sent this book by some friends in New York, I think I would have missed out. I have told as many people as possible about ordering a copy, so I decided to post it here in case anyone had any doubts"
3,"interesting, valuable as well","'Unintentional Music' is an interesing book, all though it was not what I was hoping for. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually go into finding 'your deepest creativity', which is why I bought it. It deals with the process work of Arny Mindell, directly here in application to music. However, it is still understandable by those who are not familiar with Mindell's work (kudos for that). Basic subject: using the unintential 'mistakes' made in creative acts to discover deeper psychological (and subconscious) elements effecting our outer life. Probably will be most appreciated by musicians, and open minded therapists."
5,;),Got here fast and in great condition. It works well with my chalk and long arm machine. This is much cheaper then the computer and laser stencils.
4,Not for the squeamish.,"If you've grown weary of the cartoonish spectacle that is Marilyn Manson, and if the antics of the likes of White Zombie, et al, no longer titilate, maybe it's time you gave the Swans a listen. This is genuinely disturbing music at times, and won't be to everyone's liking, but Michael Gira and company were the real deal.This compilation is an overview of their later output, and is a good place for the uninitiated to start. Check out the great covers of Joy Division's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" and the beautiful ""Can't Find My Way Home"" by Blind Faith."
4,"Beautiful, sometimes","I forgot how good The Swans could be, sometimes. Haven't listened to them since their college-radio heyday (basically the period covered in this compilaton). They definitely have a capacity for creating beauty (""Blind"", ""Her"", ""Love Will Save You""). They also have a capacity for somber tedium."

1,Good for laminate but not real wood,"It did do an okay job on any of the laminate woodwork and window sills, but I wouldn't recommend using it on any solid furniture pieces because it leaves streaks and a dull film."
2,the pics are better than the words,"I love the way this book looks...every page made me hungry. But the recipes are bit difficult to follow and they all seem to be missing some essential ingredient. In fact, 3 out of the 3 recipes that I made--following the recipe faithfully--were terrible. Give this book a miss."
1,Disappointing,"Although I enjoy exotic recipes this cookbook offers very little more than eye candy. The instructions are multilayered and intricate, often involving hard to find ingredients. Should you actually be able to finish a recipe in one go you will find hardly enough to feed one person and the taste does not equal the effort exerted. Definitely a disappointment."
2,Just another ho-hum Harlequin...,"A typical bad-boy-turns-good ho-hum Harlequin. Cal Markham needs to improve his image if he's going to take over the family company, and he and his image consultant, Annie, fall in love.There wasn't much to set this novel apart from all the other monthly offerings. It was simply a typical Harlequin. I found it to be good for a quick distraction, but there wasn't anything of lasting substance in the book. If you're looking for a feel-good quickie, this will do."
5,Tremendous!!,"I have worked as a personal fitness consultant for over 12 years training a range of clients, including plenty of competitive athletes. With this background, I have seen a number of books on this topic, but The Athlete's Ball (neat title) is by far the most comprehensive so far. The author gives a wide range of exercises (with excellent technique descriptions) to challenge even the fittest athlete - there are several exercises here that even my highest functioning clients have some difficulty with. He also did a very good job discussing the rationale for this type of training. My only gripe is maybe the pictures could have been in colour? All in all, this is easily my favourite book on core conditioning. Awesome job."
3,Suspect product.,"These balls are OK for the price, but they don't play as well as Butterfly 3 star orange balls. These seem lighter. I doubt they are authentic Butterfly balls."
3,its ok,"At first i liked the ball but then i realized that they are way to light, they are very durable but waaaaaaayyyyyy to light!!!!!!!!"
3,As advertised,Item arrived quickly. Ping pong balls seem to work fine. I liked the price. Good deal. I would likely purchase from this vendor again.
4,great balls (of fury),"My son and I are amateurs but we really like these large, bouncy balls. They're definitely more expensive than the cheapest brand but they seem to hold up well. I went for this large count size (72) because it's amazing how often a ball gets accidentally stepped on, paddle-smushed, or buried in all the junk in our garage where we play. I'm pretty sure I'd buy these again (if we ever make it to the end of our stash)."
1,Not worth the money,I don't understand how there could be 3-star and USTTA approved tournament ping-pong balls.Its roundness is so poor that the ball gives ugly bounces and it flies very unsmooth.What a waste for my 25 bucks!
1,Do not buy this,"Terrible, aweful, unplayable quality. These balls are lucky to be 1 star balls. I doubt the authenticity of this 3 star Butterfly markings. These balls will last forever because I cannot play with them. So irregular in bouncing. I have played the sport for over 25 years. Please beware. Don't buy the balls from Amazon. Get them from your usual Table Tennis equipment stores."
1,"Low quality, be aware!!","Since you are looking at an item that contains 72 balls, I am going to assume you are a serious player who wants to improve your game and intend to use these balls for multi-ball drill or for tournament/league play. I would strongly advise you to stay away from this item. Here are the reasons why:1. These are not ITTF approved as the original Butterfly balls are. The label says USATT approved, which does not translate to quality.2. I found each ball are off different weights.3. Many of them are so unbalanced because of the seam and uneven weight distribution of the two parts. If side spin is applied, the ball will display a vibrating motion as it would if one side is heavier than the other.I seriously doubt that this is a genuine Butterfly product. My guess is that MK(Martin Kilpatrick) is branding these balls as butterfly and selling it for cheap price. I have been using butterfly balls for a long time and never ever I have seen such low quality."
1,These balls are very poor quality,"this package has inconsistent quality, several of the balls I used cracked within a 1-2 minutes of moderate playing, and some of them easily crush with light pressure. I have ordered balls of this type from butterfly online several times and none of them were like this. This is the first time I've ordered from this supplier and I am very disappointed. I don't think they are selling genuine items. Don't risk $$$ buying from here, your wasting your money!!!!"
1,THESE ARE FAKE BALLS!,These balls suck so badly they're not even U.S.A.T.T approved. Also the image of the product doesn't even look like the image shown on the web..
2,I doubt it is genuine Butterfly,"I show the ball to my friends, more than half said it's not genuine Butterfly ball, compare logo with expensive ball of butterfly, it miss the circle."
1,where are my balls?,I ordered these balls on April 1st and the delivery estimate was 2-4 weeks. I checked back in late April and the delivery date estimate had moved to May 1st-May 20th or so... it is now May 24th and the estimated delivery date is now June - July. I would have never ordered this product had I know this was going to happen. The ping-pong table is currently being used to fold clothes as I wait for my balls. I hate this seller. I did not receive any notification that they were put on back order.
3,Good product but didn't receive the one ordered.,I bought this for a baby shower. It arrived quickly but I ordered the flowered towel and received the stripped one. I didn't have enough time before the shower to try to exchange it for the correct item.
4,Simple and precise,"I had checked this book out at the library and found it so useful I purchased it. In only 80-some pages, it contains all the grammar/spelling rules you'll need. For example when to use m instead of n, v and b, etc. A handy reference for the bookshelf. Oh, and this is written all in Spanish, no English translation in this book."
5,Worth every penny!,"I knew the basics of the Korean War, but that is about it. This book opened my eyes to the daily hardships suffered by the soldiers and marines who served in that ""police action"". Mr. Gilbert has written a fascinating book that details small unit armored action in Korea. He doesnt overwhelm you with tons of names you have to remember and most of the book is told in the veteran's own words with Mr. Gilbert adding the ""bigger picture"" so the reader can fully understand what is happening. There are few maps in the book, but they are extremely helpful when it comes to understanding where the armored units operated at. Overall a very well written book. My money was not wasted."
2,Marine Corps,Found this account accurate and personal. Found names of former Marines that I served with. Great resource for Marines.
5,No Long Story,"This is everything and more , my 1994 caddy was dead , no joke it had very little power i had changed plugs and wires , i got new oil and filter , but someone told me it maybe the coils so i ordered 4 of these bad boys , put them in myself very easy just do it one at a time an follow the instructions. when i was done i started the car and i was alive."
4,Some amazing music,"I'll start off by saying, "" The first song, Just Drifting (for Caresse), sucks. I don't understand why it's on the CD let alone opens the CD."" Just Drifting is so sickly sweet that I want to dismember John Denver and force feed his remains to the members of ABBA. Enough said...Overlooking that first song, the rest of the CD has some absolutely amazing songs. I'm especially partial to Stolen Kisses and Ov Power.I'm an avid Throbbing Gristle fan and didn't know what to expect from Psychic TV. I was surprised at the range of sounds and emotions. I was even more surprised by the occasional pop music. At times, I heard Soft Cell type music and rhythms.I strongly recommend this CD."
1,Do not buy this CD...,"...if you are legitimately interested in the album. Cleopatra Records, rather than mastering the CD from the master tapes, decided it would be a good idea to master the CD from an old vinyl copy from their personal collection. The sound quality, overall, is poor, and the stereo separation is off dramatically. If you really want this album, search out the Japanese 2CD, typically referred to as ""Force the Hands of Chants,"" which also contains the ""Themes 1"" album. This was actually mastered from the original tapes and is crisp in quality. Also watch out for the Cleopatra reissues of Kraftwerk records, as they were mastered in the same fashion, and I would not be surprised if other ""classic"" reissues from Cleopatra (Hawkwind, Syd Barrett, etc.) were done in the same way."
3,"A different, kinda catchy sound after a few listens...","I really enjoy Psychic TV, rank them up there on the top of the list. But I started with Ultradrug and Kondole I, II, & III (a more ambient album). After hearing these ingenious musical pieces I *had* to have more. So 'Force the Hand of Change' was my third album and I was somewhat let down.After a few listens the sound grew on me but it's nowhere near the previously mentioned albums. It has a very acoustic feel, violins and guitars, and 'earthy' vocals (for want of a better term).But then, I'm more into industrial sounds which are in abundance on the other 2 albums.I'd still recommend Force the Hand of Change though; it's a good listen. All a matter of taste!"
5,Very Pleased,The book came in a reasonable amount of time and there was no damage to the book. It was priced fairly and was in great shape.
4,John Barry's Suite of light orchestral music,"John Barry recorded a couple of CDs of light classical music in the form of Suites that he had composed - this was the first to be released. Although the harmonies are unmistakably like those we got to know so well in the James Bond movies, there is a mystical calmness about the 12 pieces here and some gorgeous orchestral sounds. If you have enjoyed the atmosphere that Barry's music has created in the Bond movies, and in very many other movie themes, then you will enjoy this CD. The pieces are performed by the English chamber orchestra conducted by the composer.John Barry: The Collection"
2,Pablum,"The pieces all lack any ""edge,"" and ,therefore, the music often seems wearyingly sentimental and saccharine."
1,I didn't like it,"I bought this cd as a fan of John Barry's melodies but there are only two or three melodies that I liked from this album.I did'n like how the electric guitar sounds at the last part of the last theme.I think his album ""Eternal Echoes"" is much better."
4,Definitely worth it if you are a Barry fan,"John Barry, who was made famous many years ago for striking themes like James Bond, has been one of the most spiritual and romantic composers during his latter years. His music is quite soothing and really speaks to the soul if you're heart is open. I think it's great that he can release original music that isn't pinned to a movie score. This collection is very good, though I think there is too much harmonica recorded throughout the cd."
2,"Collector's Encyclopedia of Cookie Jars, Book III",This book was not helpful at all. I have many older McCoy cookie jars and none of them were listed. This book mainly has new cookie jars listed. So if you are looking for a price guide for older jars this is not the book.
2,That bad huh?,All I'm saying is that the available PDF preview corroborates what the other reviewers are saying.
4,"The book is for class, so it is what it is","This book was for use for one of my masters courses. It's good for what it is written for. Would I buy it just to have, probably not, maybe I would borrow it from a library."
1,BORING!,I am currently in a MAT program. This book was required for one of my classes. It is so boring and so not worth the money. There are other books that are so much better in teaching the topic of measuring and assessing student performance.
3,What I needed for my class.,"This text is very hard to read and interpret. However, it was exactly what I had to have for my class."
1,I hate this book.,"This is the worst textbook I have ever bought for any class! It is a huge waste of money and super frustrating to read. This book is horribly written. The explanations are boring, drawn out, and unclear. The early chapters draaaag on forever. The later chapters get a little better, but they state a lot of obvious or useless information. I have spent hours and weeks studying from this text and learned very little."
2,"Quite possibly, the driest text book ever written.","Used for my Measurement & Evaluation class for my MSEd. program, I've already convinced the professor to find a new book for his next group of students. The book has inadequate explanations - all too open ended for my taste, dry writing, and hard to decipher language. It says so much, while saying nothing at all! As if the field of assessment and testing wasn't dry enough, along comes Linn, ready to make it even worse. There has got to be a better book! Needless to say, I relied on the i-net for supplementary information to our class lectures. I did not crack this book once beyond the intro chapter!"
2,I never want to see this book again!,"This book was used for an assessment class I took at TN Techological University. I'm sure the authors did not mean to, but the book is very dry and hard to read at times. However it gets easier the farther along you get. The sections with sample test questions were useful. Everyone in my class complained about this book. Our instructor used notes and powerpoints from other texts to supplement. I definately do not recommend this title."
1,Poorly written and difficult to comprehend,My classmates and professor all agree that this book is horribly written and incredibly difficult for a non-expert to sift through and comprehend. The authors contradict each other continually and the specific ideas in the book are not well explained. I cannot imagine that there is not another text out there on the subject that is more well-written.
1,Dryer than the Saharan desert!,I don't understand why any professor in their right mind would select such a terrible book for their students. I do not agree with the reviewer who said its easy enough for the college level. If I could give it a negative score I would. The terminology is extremely technical and math focused.
1,What A Waste.,"Wow, this is a horrible book. I don't need to go into detail as many of the other reviewers have already explained, but this is quite possibly the worst book I have ever been forced to read. If you don't absolutely have to read this book...don't.The only saving grace for the book is the summary at the end of each chapter. They really contain all the information you would need in regards to the material. I feel like they just tried as hard as possible to bloat the chapters with meaningless content to make the book bigger because they couldn't make a full textbook out of the summaries alone.Avoid this if you can."
4,"Very informative, but a dry read as well","I would recommend this book to teachers who would like to have a better understanding of the various types of assessments available. It is very informative, but also a very dry read."
2,Puts me to sleep,"I hate this book. I wish I had a say in what book to use for class, but this was required reading. It was so dry and boring, full of statistics-type language, no interesting graphics. The few text boxes they had were often irrelevant or confusing. As a future teaching, the entire Part I (chapters 1-5) were essentially useless to me. I wish they would have less theory and more practical applications for the average teacher. I don't feel like I learned much here."
1,what happend???,"The overall series of sailor moon novels were okay. They were at times very childish. All so, there were parts in it that were from the japanesse series of sailor moon, no the american one.But the main reason for me to five the book such a low rating, was that the author stoped at this book. There are more sailor moon novels after this. I found this horrible when sailor jupitor was just about to be introduced. Maybe the author was lazy and tired of sailor moon, either way we will never know."
4,Very interesting.,"This was a very interesting book. I liked it a lot. I read it over and over, and I am still reading it over and over. I recommend that you get this book. But only if you know Sailor Moon. If you are new to Sailor Moon, you will not understand anything that happens."
2,OK...,"...P>this book was so-so. It's NOT anywhere close to the manga (which is the BEST!), but it's better than that ""Meet Sailor Moon"" book that has 15 pages. It's a good book to get children introduced to, but if you're an ULTIMATE SAILOR MOON FAN, like me, you might as well get the manga, which is the REAL THING."
3,Throbbing hardcore beats and explicit dialogue samples.,"DIGITAL SEX HARDCORE is a decent compilation of relentlessly pounding trance hardcore offerings that won't disappoint--though by no means will they fully satisfy a true enthusiast. The album's tracks get your blood pumping--if the cover art doesn't--and may even inspire you to shake your tail-feather. As the name suggests, however, this music is much more tailored for ""driving"" (you decipher this double entendre). Lacking the all-too-important segues and build-ups of the current most popular trance CD's, D.S.H. really is just for listening--not dancing. Far from the worst, but not quite the best, I would go so far as to give this one 3.5 stars (if amazon.com would allow)."
3,Just a tad to small,I wish they had a 3 1/2 star rating. It needs to be just a little bigger but it does work and looks great. Being from grooming lounge I would expect a little better product.
4,Concise information,"This booklet is quick and to the point with great starter drawing activities. It is a bit pricey for the number of pages, but overall a good little book."
2,Poor Quality,This item may be considered a good value but is certainly not good quality. If you are looking for a disposable umbrella and live in an area that is not windy this is the umbrella for you. It is true that you get what you pay for.
1,Had to return wrong size sent,"I ordered a 7' Umbrella and received a 9' umbrella. Sent it back just this week May 26th via UPS with Return Sticker and are waiting for the original item ordered. When I receive the umbrella I will certainly write a review. However, I did receive the products in a very timely manner."
1,You get what you pay for.,I like the color and it works but the pole is pretty cheap. I am not sure how long it will last.
4,User Friendly/Low Cost,I am a first time cloth diaper user and was amazed at the low priced AIO diapers that were offered by Baby Soft! I was very overwhelmed by all the choices out there and wasn't sure what to buy. Baby Soft made it easy! Everything I needed was included with the diaper and I don't have to worry about sizing because the diapers really do fit up to 35lbs! I tried them out on my 3 year old before I had my newborn just to test them and they fit my 3 year old very well...now I'm using them on my 6 week old infant and I LOVE THEM! I can't wait to add them to my Christmas list!!
2,The Test of Time,"Well, this isn't something I'd watch multi-times if I had it at home. Like all BBC productions from 70s, it is cheaply made, though probably exact on the details, but stagebound, in that it's all set in rooms, the set decor really nice, but somewhat claustrophic. Cheap/regular video rather than film. Makes it look sketchy on screen instead of precise. I don't find the lead character to be that interesting. Though it is still a cozy mystery (takes place betw the two World Wars) it is excessively talky, the actors physically plain, sometimes irritating, and lacking in charm. Makes it more REAL that way, but less FUN. It's nice to see something NEW, but at the same time, if given a choice between seeing again my least favorite Midsomer ep or any Miss Marple or Poirot or one of the lesser-known sleuths, or watching one of these Wimsey's, I wouldn't be grabbing for Lord Peter."
4,Entertainin' and Don't Seem At All Dated,"This series really holds up, thanks to the solid source material and Carmichael's sensational star turn. His Peter Wimsey is all ""g"" droppin' mannerism and he crisply rattles off reams of dialogue with an effortless charm that brings to mind Johnny Carson who he resembles a bit. Yet, he's also a thoroughly believable character played with deft naturalism. It's a performance that should be held in the same regard as Guinness' Smiley and Leo McKern's Rumpole.The mystery here is involving, but kind of quaint, that is until we get to the final scene, which is a knockout."
5,Very good quality and reasonable price. Quick shipping too.,If you are using CPAP this item is essential to have. This is digital type and very clear to see the result. It comes with cover and gives you good protection in case you drop it.
5,Does the job,"I ordered one for everyone of my plumbers. They use it to diagnose problems with residential and commercial gas water heaters. No complaints, works great and gets the job done. Ordered from amazon, showed up on time and was exactly what I wanted."
4,"Some Good, Some Bad",But the good over weight the bad. Just ignore the two witches on here butchering music and you'll be happy. I like this album and use it a bit when I DJ.
1,BAD BAD TYPICAL CLEOPATRA RELEASE,"All I can say is that this cd is terrible, the only highlights are The Shrouds version of ""The Passion of Lovers"" and Ikon's version of ""She's in Parties."" The rest of this cd is absolutely worthless, go out and buy REAL Bauhaus!"
2,"Looks Decent, But Don't Expect Much","Cheap is the keyword here. It looks okay, though if it wasn't advertised as ""Squall's Gunblade"" then there'd be little way to tell since there's no markings on it like he has in FF8 to really make it clear and it has a weird hook-like curve to it at the tip of the blade. The part that has the Griever chain (the one thing that on this Gunblade that lets us know it's Squalls) fell off after a few months - and this was with it just sitting on a shelf. The swordis not durable at all, and if you do ever have to move it more than a few times then expect to regret it.If you want a cool-looking sword, which I do agree that it is, and never plan on touching it... ever, and don't mind that it doesn't really look like Squalls, then go for this. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere."
5,Gunblade Galore!,"I'd only heard of places that sold Gunblades and was told they were about 150$ by a few friends I met over the years. I had no idea where to find one so I went straight to E-Bay and found nothing even close (Well, besides keychains) , and then one day I went to amazon just to find some Final Fantasy stuff and stumbled on Swordstuffcom selling a gunblade for a little under 40$. I was very excited and purchased it almost immediately (I say immediately because this was my first online purchase and I got confused, lol). I recieved it a little over a week later and it looks great! I is not exactly like Squall's, which was a bit disappointing, but I think it's fantastic! The stand it comes with takes all of 10 seconds to put together and it makes the blade look even better. I highly recommend this to Final Fantasy 8 fans because of it's awesomness."
5,Excellent Offering of Shoujo Manga,"Peach Girl is one of the most enjoyable offerings of shoujo in English that I have ever read. The first story arc(covered in volumes 1-4) is my favorite!It is a very angsty teenage drama and at times it's almost painful to watch poor Momo suffer, but all ends up well in the end....until the next story arc =-p The romance and drama are well mixed and a love triangle forms slowly without you really realizing it.Fans of shoujo should be sure to pick this up!"
4,Really Fun,"If you're looking for a light, fun manga to read then pick up the Peach Girl series. The story isn't hard to follow, it has a lot of high school drama, great characters and it's really cute. While I wouldn't pick it over something like Paradise Kiss or Mars, it is charming in it's own way."
5,"Great Manga for Us Ladies, For Once!","As a young woman who enjoys manga, but who also enjoys associating with strong yet feminine female protagonists, I must say that at last a series was sent from Japan that WE Shoujo fans can enjoy! It is also a series with an important message about learning to distinguish between physical stereotypes and the reality of a person's personality. ""Beautiful"" Sae is not beautiful inside, but even protagonist-Momo's boyfriend Toji cannot get past the association of beauty with purity; Kiley, the one character who can distinguish internal/external beauty is himself stereotyped by Momo as a playboy, when he is much more. And the artwork is Grade-A! Read it or miss out on a good one."
3,Your fly is unzipped!!,When i first saw the cover of this manga it really sacred me. This poor girl didn't even notcie her fly was down. How pathectic. I probably wouldn't have read it exept that one of my friends was always going on and on about how wonderful it was so i decided to give it a try. It was actually better then i thought:-) The plot and action was tight and the characters were interesting and fun but the reason i am only giving it 3 stars is because i really don't like the artwork and the covers all make me feel like i'm gonna be sick so..... If you like fun shoujo mangas you will probably enjoy Peach girl a lot. The main characters name is Momo meaning peach in japanese that's why it's called peach girl for those who are curious.
5,Pinecones,This is another one of Mary Summer Rains beautiful books that have brought great joy to me. I also want to thank Amazone and your supplier for getting the book to me in excellent shape.
3,For review only,Quite good for a quick review of the basic concepts of all your lower division math courses AFTER you took the courses. You CANNOT study new material with this book.
5,"Book Great for Students, Working Engineers and the Layman!","I got this book because I wanted a more modern reading on numerical techniques. This book delivers this and more. Not only does it include psuedo code, but it also includes actual USEFUL code in matlab and in C++. The examples are all useful for doing either problems for the workplace, or as a textbook/supplement for a course on numerical analysis. The book also gives good physical and 'numerical' insight to the code and technique involved.If I had one numerical book to take with me, this would be it. I'm sure I would develop other techniques based on what I learned from this book."
5,Great Singer,During my trip to Italy I saw her perform on a TV show and was amazed with her music. All the songs on this CD are great!!
2,Similar to eating a really spicy citrus wet wipe...,"I had the opportunity to try this product when an error was made in my order for Patak's Hot Mango pickles and several jars of these Hot Lime pickles arrived instead. (The design on the jars is almost identical.) Since I absolutely love the Patak's hot mangos so much, I opened up one of the jars of hot lime.I wished I hadn't. The closest thing I can compare the experience of eating spicy pickled lime rinds was eating a chili-dipped citrus wet wipe. UGH!I suppose that if you have already developed a taste for eating lime rinds AND for really hot stuff, then this may appeal to you. Otherwise, steer clear."
4,The Christmas Charm,"An absolutely charming book. The spunky half Italian heroine is a nice change from the usual English miss. Nice hero, too, plus the interesting, well-researched coach trip.A delightful read!"
2,Video Quality is Barking up the Wrong Tree!,"The quality/clarity of both videos is poor. Although viewable, the picture is fuzzy and not clear. Again, you can see and follow the story. It's just very poor quality viewing.The second movie is a collie, but the name is Shep and is not ""LASSIE""."
1,Not Good,"His Girl Friday is fairly good, but My Man Godfrey has extremely erratic sound quality and the second half looks like it was clawed by wild turkeys. Buy only if you want a cheap DVD of His Girl Friday."
5,Two first rate comedies,"Normally, I would say that a film like ""His Girl Friday"" stands entirely alone. However, although I would not say that ""My Man Godfrey"" is as brilliant, it does provide for an excellent second movie to put in this package. Both films are very good, and would be enjoyed by most anybody."
5,Super Good!,"Some of the best I've heard. I don't even own this; I heard it on the radio & think this is excellent. If you like good drums? Buy it. I promise, you'll love it. These folks do a great job."
1,Poor product,I placed an order a couple of days ago for 2 sets of color and black in for my Epson printer as it was running out of ink. The cartridge packaging looked new and even had an expiration date of 11/2006. The ink cartridges printed as if there were no ink. It was worse than my cartridges that were running out of ink.
4,I loved it.,"This is the first Amanda Quick book I have ever read and I truly loved it. She did a great job making me love both Augusta and Harry. Augusta had an incredibly wild spirit that wasn't forced into being a tamed and dull wife. Yes, she began to mature...stopped breaking into studies and such, but her spirit remained bold.I also loved the secondary characters such as Peter Sheldrake and the Angel aka Claudia Ballinger. Yes it was obvious they were going to get together, but the idea of them as a couple made me smile."
3,Not Quick's best...,"First of all....I looove Amanda Quick, but this book just failed to move me..for the life of me I could not understand what Augusta saw in Harry. I was far more interested in Peter and Claudia. Harry was way too domineering. I struggled to finish this book... Not awful, but not great either..medoiocre at best."
3,"Good, but not up to par.","Harry Fleming, Earl of Graystone, was looking for a wife and mother for his daughter now that his spy activities were completed. He was looking for a demure, obedient, virtuous woman. Augusta Ballinger, last of the reckless Northumberland Ballingers, was loyal and virtuous, but definitely not demure or obedient. She went her own way and gave little thought to society's dictates. Therefore, it took London by surprise when Harry requested Augusta's hand in marriage. The couple must learn to accept each other while trying to clear Augusta's dead brother's honor and searching for a dangerous enemy spy.Lovely tale, but a bit weaker than most Quick novels. Augusta kept going on and on about her family traits for recklessness and stubborness. It got a bit old before long. The ladies club, Pompeia, was a wonderful touch. A good beach book or for a cold winter night in front of a roaring fire."
3,...,"My biggest problem was actually Augusta. She was very alive and different and a good role model for women at that time, however, she was terribly childish. She would have an attitude, throw a fit, stomp her feet, not be nice to Graystone who, to be honest, was never really cruel to her, even though she accused him of it.Another reviewer acknowledged the lack of romance. Indeed, in the beginning it was steamy, but after that it was over. The scenes were implied, but we never got to read them.And finally the mystery: oh, come on, who wouldn't have guessed the answer? There are no other suspects anyway..."
4,Fascinating,"Brava! This book is one of the most facsinating biographical works I have read in years. Ms. Watts's discussion on Mae West's life, her times, and heritage is a significant contribution to 20th century historical and cultural analysis. I am a fan of Mae, and appreciated how this book opened up a discussion on how fluid race is in American society."
4,Well-Done!,"This book is, perhaps, one of the best researched books about the life of Mae West. Yes, some readers (fans of Mae) may be offended by the author alluding to West's black heritage. But, as Mae West showed us, her ethnic identity was more complex than who her parents or grandparents were. The important thing is not that West was white or black, but that she personally identified with the culture of black people in America. What matters is that the author has intelligently revealed this aspect about Mae West, whose life time achievement was tricking us all."
1,"OH, NO! EVEN MAE WEST IS POLITICALLY CORRECT","Well folks, here we go again! Let's take a unique, popular icon -- an uneducated (in the book learning sense) woman who stood up for herself and blazed a new path in show biz -- created an indelible character that is still universally recognizable more than twenty years after her death -- and probably did as much for good ole 'woman's lib' as all the modern feminist combined -- Let's take an accomplished comedienne whose better movies to this day can ilicit genuine laughter and whose basic style and mastery of nuance were second to none ---BUT, let's not be satisfied until we expend thousands of recurring words in a hackneyed attempt to prove that Mae West was Black! Good, Lord, who cares?! Go rent a Mae West movie and you'll learn more about Mae West (and have a far better time at it) than this awful, misguided, pneumatic attempt at scholorship. Get a life Ms. Watts!"
1,Not a Good Example of Biography,"The book, Mae West, An Icon in Black and White, was one of the worst biographies I have read in recent memory. The whole premise of the book is that Mae West's grandfather may have been black. There is not a lot of proof given, just conjecture. Just because Mae was friends with Bert Williams and he visited her home, and that Mae enjoyed jazz, doesn't make her black. People of different ethnicities can enjoy many features of the culture of other ethnicities but they don't have to be of that ethnicity to enjoy it! You don't learn a lot about Mae the person from this book. Everything is discussed in racial overtones. There has to be some other books out there on Mae that will give folks a better idea of what she was like as a person."
2,disappointed,"I'll agree with the lid being a challenge to get on and off. But worse, mine leaks like a sieve."
5,FABULOUS Cocktail Shaker.,This is the one nambe gift the men will definitely enjoy (women appreciate all nambe produts) GREAT price....50% less from Frontgate
1,the lid did not fit properly,the lid did not fit the shaker properly. I would of made this review shorter but there is a character minimum.
4,Awesome gentle yoga,"I do fast yoga in the morning and was looking for a gentle wind-down yoga for the night. This is a perfect fit. The music is soothing, the voice gentle non judgemental and pace is just perfect to unwind after a long day and let those muscles relax. I use it every single day and love it. The only reason I gave it one star less is because some scenes freeze for a couple of seconds before moving to the next. I realized after a few times that the recording is that way, easy to think the DVD is not playing right. Can be corrected."
5,Lovely,"This is a gorgeous and useful DVD. Exteremly well produced. There are 6 practices - levels A and B both have practices of around half an hour, three quarters of an hour, and an hour. I've tried 2 of the level A practices so far, even though I'm not a beginner, and really liked them. They are gentle vinyasa, but one does work. Very thorough and well taught work... The extra chapters on individual poses are extremely well done also.I love this dvd. The day after a weights workout I find it impossible to do power yoga. This is great without being too easy. Tones and stretches every part of your body and as a great bonus the shavasana is a yoga nidra which leaves me feeling totally mellow, relaxed and revived.Oh, and the instructor besides clearly knowing her stuff has a very nice and mellow voice.Highly recommended."
5,Very Nice Video,"It's been YEARS since I have done any form of yoga, so I was a little hesitant as to which beginner's video to choose. I am very happy with this choice. I love the pose guide on the menu, she does a very good job explaining what the pose is and how to do it. The A part video (I have not moved to the B part) is very well done. Zyrka does an excellent job transitioning from one pose to another, describing the pose movements that I could easily listen to her and follow the cues. THAT is a nice touch, for most videos my eyes are glued to the screen to find out what to do next, so I do appreciate being able to truly get into the poses without looking to see if I am right. Overall, this is an excellent product and I am very happy with it."
1,DVD does not work.,"DVD is faulty. It stops about 5 minutes into the only 2 programs I wanted to use. This is a problem with the DVD facility, as it apparently was not checked before packaged. Need to return, and that's a total pain. Plus I pay shipping. Not buying DVD's here again."
5,Love this DVD,"I just got this dvd the other day and, for me, it is the best yoga dvd that I own. The pace is easy, but perfect with clear instruction. My other yoga dvd's are more strenuous and energetic and not what I want all the time. If you are looking for good vinyasa flow routines that are easy to follow, gentle and move from one movement to the other in a slower fashion, you will love this."
5,If Lovin this book is wrong....,"I for damn sure don't wanna be right!! Please believe me when I tell you this book was HOT!!! I could not put it down, I started reading it this morning around 8 AM, I just finished and it's about 9:30 PM. Yeah, it's that good. Reading about Holiday, Lance and Roman the 2 best friends she's torn between was really addictive. I just had to keep going to see what was gonna happen next. The drama on a scale of 1-10 is off the meter. You will not be dissapointed in this novel. I e-mailed Alisha Yvonne and she responded back, and told me there will be a sequel. All I wanna know is, when is it coming out??!!"
3,The Ending Is Wrong,"It's hard nowadays to find one good man. Well how about two? Holiday Simmons has found a few good men. So what's the problem you ask? These two men are best friends and former co-workers of Holiday's. Each man brings to the table different things that Holiday desires in a man. Roman adds adventure and thrills with his thug passion. He's a conformed playa (or is he?) slightly rough around the edges. Lance is the perfect gentleman. He treats her like a queen. She loves them too much to choose. She loves them too much to leave them alone. As time passes, feelings grow, and jealousy rears its ugly head, this trio is on a collision course. Will any of them be strong enough to leave well enough alone?While I liked the concept, I found this book to be unrealistic a great deal of the time. I didn't care for the dialogue. The EXTREME over usage of terms like ""baby girl"" and ""boo"" were sickening. I applaud the author for her efforts, but better luck next time."
1,I did not enjoy this book,"Lovin You Is Wrong was not a good read. I found it hard to get attached to the characters. I thought the storyline was simple and I could not relate to any of the characters. I thought Holiday was underdeveloped and I was highly dissappointed by the ending of the story. I hope that the sequel is better, Ms. Yvonne may be able to redeem herself if it is. I would not suggest that anybody go out and buy this book. It is a waste of money and time."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book was garbage, so unrealistic. I know it's suppose to be fiction, but give me a break. These characters were so dumb. No one should go through all that before they wake up and smell the coffee. Very disappointed with this purchase and will not recommend to any of my family or friends. Really wish I could get a full refund. Total garbage!!!!!!!"
2,Reading this was wrong!,"This book was so slow getting started & it is very ""Jerry Springer"" worthy. I can not believe that 3 grown professionals would allow themselves to not only get to caught up in but stay in the crazy bizarre relationship!!It was just too much. I am glad I borrowed this book & did not purchase it."
1,Keepin' it VERY REAL...,I'm not going to surgar-coat it...I'm going to be VERY REAL. This book was straight G-A-R-B-A-G-E from page one. I was initially pulled in by the storyline...working sistah caught in a love triangle with 2 men (who happen to be friends).That's where it QUICKLY ended for me... this book failed to pull me in and I expect that within the first 2 chapters. I often found myself struggling to figure out where the author was going with this story...how she was trying to introduce us to the characters. As for the characters...they were weak at best and I read as far as 10 chapters before I finally gave up. There didn't seem to be a connection between the characters and they just didn't appeal to me nor did they draw me to their story.Yet another book for my fireplace....
2,2 better than 1?,"I did not like this book at all. It started off pretty good, and then lost me. It was a struggle for me to finish. I just think that these two incredibly smart, handsome, and successful men fall so deeply in love with one woman that they will risk everything to be with her, is a bit far-fetched. Okay,I know this is fiction, but come on now. I did not enjoy this book, and was glad I borrowed it from a relative."
1,Unusable in Belgium,"I can't use it because it's protected for use in the USA only, I'll think. My dvd player says 'wrong code'"
5,So good,"If you are interested enough to look up info on this, you will love it. Totally great entertainment. Just a wealth of talent and legendry on these three DVDS.Voice Lessons To Go Volume 2: Do Re Mi Ear and Pitch Training"
3,Great Concert with AV Synching Problems in Disc 3,"In this day and age it is unacceptable to find DVDs with Audio Video Synchronization problems.This DVD is full of great performances, the audio and video are top notch, and it is a must buy, however, it is a shame that Disc 3 with the ""bonus performances"", is marred with audio video synching problems.As stated by another reviewer, the producers should have moved all the material cut from the HBO special (the bonus performances) into the regular concert as it was performed during October 29th and 30th, 2009, for a better viewing experience. And in the process, they would have been forced to fix the audio video sync.Hope future editions are fixed as this is truly a gem."
5,Lots of Great Rock Entertainment!!,Length:: 2:47 MinsI love Rock N Roll. So put another dime into Amazon's pocket baby...or soemthing like that. This is my first video review of a concert. I hope you like it!.The 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame Concerts (2BD) (Blu-ray)
4,Rock and Roll will NEVER die!!!!,"For those of us that were children of the 60's and 70's this DVD is a must for your music library!!!The complete E Stree Band, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Jeff Beck and the list goes on and on. And I believe this was the last public performance made by Clarence Clemmons."
4,Wish you were here,"Best multi-artist show since ""The Concert for NYC"" in the aftermath of 9/11. Amazingly, the two best performances are Fergie with U2 on ""GimmeShelter"" and Tom Morello pairing with Bruce on ""Ghost of Tom Joad"". CSN with James Taylor, Stevie Wonder with Sting and Jeff Beck, and Metallica backing up Ozzy and Ray Davies are highlights as well. Love this DVD. Great bluray video."
5,Rock & Roll,Some concerts you must have well lady's and gentlemen this is it pure legends on stage to me I was in amazement !!!
5,The 25th Anniversary Rock 'N roll Hall of Fame (3DVDs),"This DVD is an absolute joy. Mick Jagger and Fergie are magic. Bruce and Bono are brilliant. Matalica are magnificent. Aretha amazing, Stevie wonderful. So many fantastic artists. We are so fortunate to see them together on this fantastic historical DVD. It is musicaly and visually awesome."
1,Disappointed in purchase,When I ordered this item I thought I was getting the DVD. My husband just opened it and it is a set of 4 CD's and no DVD. Am disappointed in the way this was presented.
1,Two copies both defective,Two copies of this Blu-Ray version. Each copy had audio drop outs on the first disc in exactly the same spots. It is like the master is no good.2nd disc has some good stuff
5,TOP QUALITY !,"Very good concerts.Great sound and perfect quality od video.A blu Ray top quality I recommend to all the rock and roll lovers ! And so many artists performing ... quality , interest , everything we would like to finf more often ...Hope you understand my very bad English knowledge ... but : BUY THIS BLU RAY !Michel"
5,Blow You Away Concert,"I was there, an incredible concert. One might have a tendency not to expect much, with artists 'behavior' on stage getting out of hand on many of these 'get togethers', BUT this gathering was chicken skin moments, especially Mick, Bono and Fergie doing Gimme shelter. You will not go wrong buying this, if you have remote interest in these artists, you will love the job they did."
2,concert great - DVD quality control lacking,"I received a copy with defects in the DVD - it hung-up/ stuttered during the 4th or 5th song on each disc. I contacted the seller who was great about shipping a replacement but alas, the second copy had the same problem (actually slightly worse). Note: I reproduced the problem on 2 different DVD players to be sure it was the discs and not my player. After seeing that this defect affected more than one copy, I contacted Time Life for help with their manufacturing defect. They offered nothing except to refer me back to the seller who had already gone out of his way to help but had been unsuccessful. I'm really disappointed with Time Life but, if you're lucky enough to get a defect-free copy, you'll get to enjoy a great concert."
1,not happy with quality,"We bought this dvd. It played to a certain point, then it would not continue. We returned it, ordered another one, and the exact same thing happened in the exact same place on the dvd. Very disappointed.I wonder if anyone else had this same thing happen."
1,Defective Product,"Really wanted this DVD. On disc one, the volume cut in and out throughout making it impossible to listen to. Returned to Amazon for a replacement. I asked that the replacement disc not be from the batch/lot of the original. However, the replacement DVD had the same problem. Gave up and asked for a refund. The picture quality looks quite good, and for those that are lucky enough to have one with complete sound, I'm sure it is a good product. You would think Time Life Entertainment would produce a quality product and have quality assurance and control procedures in place to keep defective discs from being distributed. These could be bootleg reproductions. I did give a one star rather than zero because Amazon was very quick and helpful in returning the item. Just wish that Amazon could have found me a good copy."
3,Amazing Concert but DVD is a Ripoff,"This was one of the most amazing concerts of all time BUT this DVD was advertised as having additional material that was not included in the HBO special. The additional material is not very exciting, nor from the key artists or performances. So if you DVR'd the HBO concert, don't waste your money here."
5,I never buy discs...,but made an exception when I saw this concert on Palladium. One of the greatest gathering of rock musicians ever.
3,The Discs Do Not Play Correctly They Freeze UP,"The content is excellent as expected. There is something wrong with the DVD's themselves. I have a new Sony DVD player and these DVD's freeze up! I have no problems with any other DVD's in this machine, so it is this set that is defective."
4,rock and roll,great video.. except for language in the ozzie osborn segment.. the begining of the dvd was great and the end was good the heavy rock with ozzie just not for kids.
5,Engagement with the Big Boys,"What a spectacular DVD set loved every track and give you a very diverse musical package - thank god someone wrote some decent liner notes - what a pleasure which you do not get when you download. Highly recommended for anyone who like great music.PS Watch the U2, Jagger, Fergie track man what a hot track. I did not realise how good Fergie was !! Go Girl. PPS Jagger and Bobo were no slouches.Dave Sydney"
5,Wonderful!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this account of Chung Ju Yung's life and the rise of Hyundai. The son of impoverished farmers, Chung managed to build the world's largest shipbuilding company, create a competitive Korean automobile, and sped the development of South Korea into one of the world's foremost economies--all with little more than sweat and determination!Steers does a great job of detailing Chung's personal and business character, along with providing a detailed history of the growth of Hyundai in the larger context of the Korean economy. I highly recommend it!"
3,A sugar-coated biography,"Steers' book is well-written but is so sugar-coated that it could easily have been endorsed by Hyundai and Chung Ju-Yung himself. For a more realistic picture of Mr. Chung, read Korean dynasty: Hyundai and Chung Ju Yung by Donald Kirk. Kirk pulls no punches in showing the fact that many of Chung's employees secretly hated him for his despotic style of management. The revelations about Chung's personal life are truly shocking."
5,What a wonderful book!,"I have most every book on costume jewelry; seem to collect the books as much as the jewelry. This one is wonderful--full of hundreds of COLOR photos, great examples shown, and it's not all the rare stuff but pieces I actually own. The value guidance seems to be pretty accurate with what's selling in my part of the country.Mr R has done a great job--thank you!"
3,"Good commentary, poor photos.","Overall, the commentary in this book in wonderful. But the photography leaves something to be desired. Some of the photos are too dark to be very beneficial in identifying the items.Many are just not up to the quality which one would expect in a publication of this topic. Where's the sparkle in the stones? Why is the metal so dull looking? I'm happy to have the book, but found the photography a big disappointment."
3,"It doesn't suck, but somehow doesn't quite fulfill either.","This is the same sort of comfortable, entertainingly pretentious and self-consciously melodramatic goth-rock you'd exect from anyone in this corner of the genre (i.e. Sisters of Mercy/Sisterhood, Nefilim/Fields of the Nephilim, Mission/Mission UK, and/or Rosetta Stone), and it does have one of their best tracks on it. But somehow this just doesn't seem to live up to its potential, even within the narrow confines of this ""trying to sing as deep and angsty as possible"" gothic subspecies. If you're a diehard fan of this sort of dark pop, you'll surely dig this album. But if you only like 1/3 of what the Sisters ever did, and don't like more than a few Rosetta Stone tracks, you can safely skip this album, since they all might as well be the same band, and this release isn't one of the shining stars of that particular firmament."
3,griller,"product is good but there should have been an added feature to allow for easy removal, such as a zipper or tie."
4,"Great cover, not so great in the desert heat.","I have this covering my beautiful Weber Summit series grill. It's a perfect fit and works great! The 110+ weather in sunny Arizona does not fit well with this cover as I've owned the cover for just over a year and it started coming apart at the seams from direct intense heat. If you lived anywhere but the desert and a place with humidity, i'm sure it would be just fine.I would recommend this grill cover to anyone that owns a weber grill. It's a nice solid, heavy duty cover to protect it from the elements.This cover comes with a 2yr warranty. It was a quick 2 minute phone call to weber support and I now have a new cover on the way. You really get what you pay for when you buy a weber."
3,"Good, but not perfect...","I bought this product thinking it was waterproof all over - as it seemed to be so on the pictures here - and even on the box it came in. However, on each side there is a mesh vent which is quite large. That means that if it rains, the side trays of my grill get wet. They probably take no harm, but there are not so pretty water marks as a result. The vents are probably there for a reason, but I would prefer them to not be there... Apart from that, this product does exatcly what it says in the tin... I mean box :)"
5,Outstanding Sci-Fi Adventure,"I've read this and the sequel (Starfollowers of Coramonde) many times over. One of my favorites of all time. The story is fast paced, and the characters are extremely believable. romance, humor, pitched battles and hair raising terror all under one title."
3,"Good book, but...","This is a reprise of my review of the 'Starfollowers' half of this duo (see the reviewThe Starfollowers of Coramondewhich in 25 words or less is: ""know that this version's format is the exact 4x7 Del Rey paperback version in a 6x9 paper size - for $18 I expected more."" I know, I know,'buyer beware.'TIP: unlike the 'Starfollowers' product page, this one has the 'look inside' feature which would've instantly tipped me off...had I bothered to look."
4,Good blend of scifi with fantasy,"""The Doomfarers of Coramonde"" is a fast paced book that fictional people from real world events (the Vietnam War) and has those characters from that situation get transported magically into a fantasy world. So you have an APC with its crew facing a dragon and magical people. The characters are well developed and the story flows well.It sounds hokey, but in this rare case, it actually works and the book is a good read. It is rather dated now, and it also has some science fiction elements in it about parallel worlds and such, but that seems to work in the plot as well."
2,Fun series - tragic technology,"I enjoyed this series when I watched it live, and the series is fun to watch on DVD. Fast, spicy and interesting. The DVD quality earns this product a low score. The picture is jumpy - almost constantly; even when played on numerous different players. I am going to request a replacement from Amazon. UPDATE - I received a replacement set - the quality of the picture is equally bad. For the record, I did a count and there are about 20-25 dropped frames each minute. This series is worth it, but these are the worst DVDs I have ever owned."
1,How bad can it be?,"It can be and is bad. A long time fan of crime drama, I purchased Silk Stalkings as for viewing with exercise. I have had it for months and haven't been able to get past first two episodes. Dialogue is pure drivel. The producers clearly thought a couple of pretty faces and short skirts would distract from the terrible acting. No one is that good-looking and the wardrobe it would take to carry this show has yet to be designed."
1,silk stalkings,Terrible picture/sound quality...like it was shot by an amatuer. Only lasted about 5 minutes and gave it up.
4,"""Rich, sexy and decadent""","I watched ""Silk Stalkings"" when it first aired and I never missed an episode. It is a crime drama set in Palm Beach, Florida. Palm Beach, a place where the rich and beautiful have a different set of rules and if you like provocative and fun, you'd enjoy this show.The show is like ""chocolate"". It is sweet, delicious and decadent; you know it is probably bad for you but you keep endulging.I have purchased all five seasons of ""Silk Stalkings"" for my library and I recommend this series. Keep in mind that season 5 has dramatic surprises and changes.For a show that takes you to a world of the rich, sexy and dangerous-it is another winner created by Stephen J. Cannell. You can't go wrong by paying a visit."
1,VERY BAD QUALITY,The DVD's are VERY POOR QUALITY - very grainy/fuzzy and out of focus. It was so bad I couldn't watch it. We have ordered many DVDs from Amazon.com but this is the first one we've ever received of such horrid quality. My husband says he'll keep it and watch it for only $8. But I am very skeptical and will probably not order any more DVD's from Amazon any more because of it. I personally would like to have a replacement. I feel cheated out of $8
5,The best dvds ever..!!,ive been getting a few dvd's from amazon for a while now and i must say they are great..i love my old tv shows..i will be getting more very soon..!!
4,More Than Just Sex & Cops -- Great Series,"Start out thinking this is going to be a cheap sex & cops show, follow through the end - it really captures your heart, especially but not limited to the final series. (Recommend starting with later than first, and DEFINITELY get the final show !!! Deep, surprise ending to series)."
5,Just in time for summer...,"[...] After a friend of the family recommended the book to me I decided to include it with my summer reading. I was surprised when it arrived because I did not realize the Lulu book was a new and revised edition. It was a nice surprise, though. Bottom line is I loved this book. It was the perfect book to start my summer reading with I have already passed it on to another friend. Yes, I recommend this book to others and I am looking forward to Mark McNulty's next book."
3,"interesting to some, not to most","_Seige and Survial_ retells the experienes of the author during the 3 year seige of Leningrad by the Nazis. The bitter cold, the near-starvation, the shelling and bombardment - all are presented here. But the book lacks a sense of the real-life drama and the sense of urgency and danger the event warrants. For the historian, or those interested in first-hand accounts, the book has its value. For the rest, a better book by far is Stokesbury's _The 900 Days_."
2,This book is confusing and relatively poorly written.,"I am a hands on designer in need of clear, concise design data on DC - DC converters. This book has been difficult to use. My associate also has tried to use this book with somewhat the same impression.I have found mistakes in circuits and poor derivations, missing important intermediate steps. The author relies heavily on papers by Middlebrook, so you might as well read them yourself."
4,This CD rules!!!!,This cd is awesome. it shows that small punk bands are very underated. this is my fav. cd and u should get it b-cuz it has reaaly awesome songs and music! get this cd!
5,give it some time--this CD will grow on you!!!!,"When I first got this CD I considered it to be ""ok"" by Lagwagon standards (which means it is still awesome), but it began to grow on me and I am definitely into their new sound now, just as much as I was the old stuff! the lyrics are so deep and meaningful, one of the reasons lagwagon never gets old and every time I listen I respect the band even more. And to see them live is even better--the new stuff is awesome because it breaks down into a type of sound original to Lagwagon--it can't be called punk or emo or hardcore, it's something totally original, but awesome!!!"
3,Halfharted,"This album isn't the best, and it isn't the worst. If you like catchy punk, try the frist two Lagwagon albums ""Duh"" and ""Trashed"" , ""Hoss"" their third album, was the border from which the band produced briliance and setteled for this weak trash. My advise save you money"
5,this cd KIKS,"this lagwagon cd is the best of them ALL. I just got into them, and i've been wondering where the hell i was this whole time, missing out on such good punk. There are catchy melodies, so it rules. But its still punk no matter what."
3,Now for something in English...,"Lagwagon is without a doubt my favorite punk band. They have the pace of NOFX paired with melodies and vocals that get me everytime. But this follow up to Double Plaidnum came out of left field. I think Double Plaidnum was strong enough to keep fans satisfied well into '99. Granted, any Lagwagon is good Lagwagon. I've only listened to once, and it usually takes a few listens to fully absorb the catchiness. What hit me first was the stunning simularities some songs have to older stuff by the band. I fear the guys may be running out of steam. Good tracks include the first one and number 10, The Kids are All Wrong, which starts out with a piano and has a nice,slow, haunting melody. But when it picks up into what sounds like a great song, it's just a new song. In the classic style of Lagwagon, the songs are continuous."
2,Getting worse.,"Lagwagon used to make really good catchy punk rock. But they don't anymore. None of these songs would be good enough to be on their brilliant ""Double Plaidinium"", and not even on ""Hoss"". This wouldn't be ok even if it was a B-side collection. I think they're getting old...probably."
1,A waste of time,"A simply awful book. From the absurd ""plot"" (if there really is one) to the completely undeveloped characters this book will waste a couple hours of your life. I decided to actually finish it to see how stupid it got. I shouldnt have."
2,Use It To Get A List Of the Topics,"Please don't expect too much when you buy a ETS published test-prep book for a ETS created/administered test. If this book REALLY taught you and guided you on how to pass it, they would lose millions on prospective teachers who must continually shell out money to retake it again and again.Instead, you get a book that features one very good practice test and more detailed lists of the topics that it displays on the online Test At Glance for this exam.Use on those levels, but not really worth buying. Please try and borrow a copy from someone."
4,satisfied customer,"I received this book from amazon in a timely manner. After completing the practice test and reading the tips, I felt more confident on test day. I do not have my scores back yet so I can't whether I passed or not, but o definitely feel like this book helped me feel well prepared and gives accurate simulation of the real test. I recommend this book for nervous test takers who need practice before taking the actual test."
3,praxis II study guide,"It broke down exactly what to study, which was somewhat helpful. I could have just read my notes and looked in my text books' table of contents and have gotten the same info...so its good for the lazy, or distracted like me. The study guide itself, no problems with it."
2,So So,"This product not only took over 3 weeks to arrive, but is not extremely helpful in preparation. It does contain a practice test with explanations but it is not very helpful in the actual studying for the test."
3,"It's fine... a little flimsy on the wiring, but gets the job done.",Didn't want to spend a lot... this is fine for the money. Not a bad buy.
1,Buyer beware,Do not buy this book used without the computer codes if you are going to be using an online supplement - it either will not have codes or they will be expired and you will have to pay extra to buy them from the publisher.
3,quick delivery ... smelly product,The item was delivered pretty quickly but I had to put air fresheners and then air dry it in order to get rid of a very over powering cigarette smell. After doing that the book is great.
1,Don't Buy This BOOK!!! It's a WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!,"IF I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS I WOULD!!!I bought this book thinking that it would actually help me pass the exam. Boy was I wrong!!! I read this worthless fertilizer cover to cover and I've failed my practice exam everytime!!! I can't begin to tell you just how useless this book is, there is nothing good to say about this book. You will need to find another answer as your soucre of study material for this exam; cause this exam cram is the wrong route.Just play it safe and don't buy this book!!! It's useless."
1,Want to pass the Exam - Don't Buy this!,This book was worthless. It only provided the most basic of information that would be usefull to someone who hasn't even attempted to see the service in question. It doesn't even cover all of the areas in the exam.
4,Great!,"Very nicely built, although it LOOKS flimsy in some places. The box it came it, however, tore, and UPS had to rebox it, so i had to go through two boxes. The item was dusty and dirty when i unboxed it, and screws were all over the place. But the product was definitely useful. A bit over-priced though. just a few bucks though. no big deal."
3,"Will do the job, but not impressed.","So as the product goes it will do the job. But you can tell that they sent me a product that has been used on another vehicle possibly returned. Lots of scratches on the hitch. The welds look pretty bad. They need to learn how to do a proper weld. I would not be surprised if after a length of time these weld fracture under stress. And the nuts and bolts were just loose in the box. You really couldnt spend $.02 on plastic bag. 1 washer was missing. As I said, it will do the job, but not impressed. I had high hopes for this product, but I guess you get what you pay for and who you purchase from."
3,Functional only,The main support tube is welded on to the frame assembly crooked - makes it look lopsided when installed. The paint/finish is barely on; out of the box the paint was coming off in a few places and after the first trip - the tie downs rubbed off even more. I have this for a Mazda CX-9 and it's pretty low to the ground and sometime the rack scrapes (like step drive ways).On the plus side - price was good for something that sits to the garage way more than it gets used.
4,Reclaiming Intimacy by Heather Jamison,I bought this book for a friend because it came highly recommended by my daughter. Both women felt the book helpful to many aspects of newly-married couples even when the circumstances were not similar. My daughter (now 28) hopes it will be made readily available to High School aged girls.
1,waste of time,"When I began reading this book I was unaware that it was the third in the series and by the end of it was glad I hadn't bothered to purchase the first two. There is nothing arousing about this book, just gallons of come (literally!). The book is about 3 sisters who are trapped in a German schloss of a half mad, half genius man (according to the back cover). The writing is really annoying with sisters repeating themselves in a rythmn which I gathered was intentional but I found quite pointless. The supermarket scene was just sick (and I like my books weird!). The sisters are forced to eat products made out of their milk, mushrooms grown in their own excrement at a table decorated with orchids grown up a certain orifice. The sex scenes are brief (2) and if you don't like sister involved with incestuous spanking give this a miss. The ending was left open to allow for another book and all I can say is to the author - don't bother."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT,"This product clams to be compatible with the Epson Stylus printer, but THEY ARE NOT. Do not buy this product for you epson printer becuause you will end up having to return it to amazon.com. when you put it in the printer, it doesnt print anything at all, even though it fits into the slot and everything. Your best bet is to go with the Epson brand of cartridge, becuase these so-called compatible brands do not work at all."
1,Had to throw mine out!,"Initially I planned on writing this review as a direct challenge to the last person's. ""How could it just not work?"" I wondered, ""after all, the Black Nectron cartridge that I installed two weeks ago works just fine!"" Needless to say, after installing the Nectron color cartridge my Epson StylusScan 2500 won't work at all. PERIOD. Worst than the last person's review, it won't even work without generating a printer error! And, yes, I installed it properly and tested it several times by going back and forth between it and the earlier Epson cartridge I was ready to replace (it still had a little bit of ink left in it). Every time I put the Nectron into the printer she makes a loud clunking noise during startup and the red ""error"" light goes on. As soon as I put the Epson cartridge back in it starts to work again. I was so sure that the reviewer before me had just received a fluke cartridge, now I'm wondering if the fluke would be to get one from Nectron that works!"
3,It's O.K. but...,"I have a brief rule-of-thumb for evaluating techincal books; ""If it saves me an hour, it was worth the price"". This book saved me an hour. However, if you have a fast, reliable internet connection (ie. T1 or better) then I would recommend just using Netscape's Online Developer Reference and save a few bucks. By the way, Netscape has done a first class job with their online techincal references. This book is really just selected sections from there. I do like having a good ole book for late nite reading and the material is relative, but somewhat shallow. This book is advertised as a Windows NT and Unix reference, but it's really targeted to the NT users. I have not read any competing books and the only thing I can compare it to is Netscape's Web Pages which really out-shine!"
3,"strong on human interactions, weak on cycling/scenery","At age 50, the author travelled by bicycle from the West Coast to the East Coast in three separate trips. The first segment was undertaken with his older brother, the second with his young daughter, the final leg mostly solo. Experienced touring cyclists will likely find neither much fascination nor actual ""information"" in this account, since the author often reveals (and readily admits) a lack of both adequate preparation and planning before and during his trips. Technical aspects aside, however, Stan Purdum displays and shares a keen, sensitive insight into the personal interaction component of his journeys. This book is certainly not in any way a ""how to"" book on cycle touring; it's really more of a personal journal, shared with the reader. I can't honestly say that I loved the book, but it's certainly still a decent read. The title comes from a line borrowed (with proper attribution) from a jazz tune. Roll on, fair winds."
2,Perfectly pleasant but not much there,"I really want to like this book: the author's earnestness and obvious interest in sharing his story shines through. Unfortunately, I just didn't get much from it: virtually none of his anecdotes or philosophies are memorable. I felt like I was reading a daily diary with some 'theory' interspersed throughout. This was a really quick read (which isn't bad) that left me feeling unsatisfied (which is). I've read so many very good narratives over the years that this one just didn't make the cut. I wish it had."
2,pretty bad,"I absolutley love Fastball's Are You Ready For the Fallout. It's a wonderful catchy song. I also like Third Eye Blind's Horror Show and Greenday's Nice Guys Finish Last. Unfortunately, most of the rest of the songs are pretty bad. My Hero and Hot For Teacher are alright, but I've always hated Run. The remainder of the songs just blend together."
4,Great Soundtrack!!!!!,"It was a great soundtrack I was almost tempted to give it 5 stars but then I realized that deserved the best and this soundtrack was great but not the best. Great songs from Collective Soul, Foo Fighters, Loudmouth and a whole ot more to throw in but if you aren't a rock type person STEER CLEAR as a friend of mine learnt!!! but if you are then this is one fantasic soundtrack.."
3,Good but not great...,"Maybe it's just me but Sprung Monkey sucks compared to AC/DC. The worst thing they could have done was use their awful cover of ""Thunderstuck,"" and that exactly what they did. Maybe I was too hopeful of the ""Thunderstruck"" from the movie being on the soundtrack. I still gave them a chance, and gave Sprung Monkey's cover a listen...and threw up a little in my mouth upon doing so.Everything else was good, but the lack of AC/DC on the soundtrack just killed it for me."
2,Few Good Tunes,"I'm one of those people who buys CDs for one or two songs, and lucks out if the whole CD rules. In this case, I bought this one for ""Hero"" and ""Run""...I didn't luck out. Although there were a couple of good ones in addition to those, the rest sucked and I was greatly disappointed in a soundtrack that is supposed to represent people my age."
4,YOU WONT REGRET BUYING THIS ONE!!!,I just got this cd this weekend and I thought It really rocked!!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I didnt like the remake song that much...The people who orginnally sang it were alot better!!!! Contact me and talk about it.
4,Good tunes but disappointed with ThunderStruck track,"It's a good CD and I am enjoying it, but I was disappointed that the ThunderStruck track was not done by ACDC and the remake was bad.I'm pretty sure they used the real ACDC cut in the movie."
2,Alternative trash,"Astoundingly lacking in creativity, the 'artists' here who have released 'original' songs on this soundtrack really ought not to have. Stereotypically whiny and boring, as one would expect from a soundtrack to a teen angst movie."
1,Deceiving Title - Save Your Money!,"If you want to see naked women giving lap dances, then this is the video for you. However, if you want to learn how to give a lap dance and lap dance techniques, there really is no Lesson in the Lap Dance Lessons video. Save your money and spring for The Art of Exotic Dancing for Everyday Women and The Art of Exotic Dancing for Everyday Women II."
1,LAME,"This video is not what I expected at all -- teaching me how to do a great lap dance for my husband. It's not ""lessons"" at all, just cheesy porn. Don't waste your money on this if you want to get a great lesson, get ""Erotic Strip Dance."" Much more instruction, good instruction, for your money."
1,Strictly for viewing pleasure,Each striper discusses what makes a good client for them and does not provide with lessons for women who are interested in learning moves.
1,no talent,"These women displayed NO talent, and they all did the EXACT SAME moves! they just took their clothes off and touched themselves. It didn't teach anything at all. In many scenes, there wasn't even a chair, much less a person for them to give a lap dance to."
1,Save your money buy something else........ STUPID video,This should be called a documentary of the x stripper/ porn star this video didn't teach me anything except I wasted 19.99 It is more for a man to get a tv hard it teaches a women nothing about the art of the lap dance. Hated it. Buy Carmen Electra's version of anything they are great.
1,Misleading,"This is not an instructional video. It is only a bunch of woman performing. I found the title and description very misleading. If you want to learn to give lap dances, don't buy this video...it will not teach you anything."
3,Great gift for a guy!,"No, you won't find any direct lap dance instruction on this dvd, but it will put the special guy in your life in the mood for a ""homemade"" lap dance!I gave this dvd 3 stars because the interviews are good and I was able to pick up some new moves from some of the performers in the video. All performers displayed good routines, but there was no spark or extra creativity displayed. None of them used props or toys and the transitions between the moves were edited out or just plain not filmed in some scenes. Nevertheless, I was especially pleased to see women lap dancing with each other and the African-american performer was a treat to watch!If you're looking for actual lap dance instruction, try Sheila Kelly or Carmen Electra's videos. This dvd is definitely performance only."
1,NO lap dance lessons here,"Not worth purchasing to learn something. This was definitely NOT a video to assist learning some lap dance moves, it is only a lot of females grinding on each other, I gave it to my boyfriend, maybe he will enjoy it."
1,Dissapointed.,"The sound and picture quality is really the only good thing this DVD has going for it, which is excellent by the way. But the footage and music was a bit boring actually. For home entertainment don't bother, this DVD is best left for a store to run on constant loop to display sound and picture quality of home theater systems.I was hoping this DVD would have some really exciting race footage combined with heart-pumping rythms and beats. But it doesn't. The music is rater subdued and the race footage, although skillfully shot, doesn't really excite me, and I'm a *big* motorsports fan."
1,PRICE GOUGING!!!!!,"This is WAYYYYY too expensive at $1.84 per bar. Yes, Bounty bars are the ultimate chocolate and coconut experience (especially the Dark variety) but this price is outlandish. A more resonable price would be $4.29 which represents a 20% discount from what you might pay at your local supermarket and which you don't have to wait for DAYS to receive. C'mon you british clowns, Americans are not as stupid as you think."
2,It's ok...,"The book is nice, but there are other sources which have been around for awhile which are just as good. The author talks of the Paschal Mystery...over and over and over. Granted, this is a part of our lives as Christians, but she didn't ""invent"" it. It just seems if you're not following her writing and theology, you're not being a good Catholic christian and don't know how to worship. However, I still use the book from time to time."
2,Very Fragile,"While this item is beautifully made, it is also very fragile. The glass is so thin that one minor mishap will crack it. I broke the lid the very first time I used it. It works well for brewing tea, you just have to be careful with it."
3,Reconciling different dreams in the Australian outback,"If you have seen other movies by Werner Herzog (e.g. Aguirre the Wrath of God), this movie might remind you of his familiar theme of the collision of modern out-of-balance civilization with savage or state-of-nature blissful mysticism. A land dispute pits a powerful Australian mining company against a group of Aborigines who believe this sacred land is where mythical green ants dream (the title of the film). But unlike the straightforward good guy vs. bad guy movie, this plot unfolds amidst a slow but definite transformation of the characters on both sides of the dispute (and the judge who medaties the dispute), all of whom live through this encounter in different ways. Don't worry -this movie does not beat a pious message into your head."
5,"Is the word ""GEM' overused ?","This movie is Bruce Spence as wished for. It's Australia on display, it has become one of my favorite Australian films of all time. The aboriginals are really good. I can't say exactly what hits me, because its not a flashy pop culture type of thing. It's about a big truth heading our way, and everyone has a different name for it and various ways of understanding it. If you don,t have any any depth or imagination it will just sail on past you. Feel lucky if you haven't seen it yet, because it's something to look forward to."
2,"Well Meaning, but...","I have a great deal of respect for Werner Herzog and have been moved by many of his films, but unfortunately this isn't one of them.Stunning visuals. The Australian Bush is an amazing sight. An Aboriginal face has something about it that makes you think you're looking back through all 40,000 years of their history, into something wise and mystical.""Are you enjoying the movie?"" I was asked after 30 minutes.""I'm still waiting for it to start.""I'm sorry, but there is a sole conflict throughout. A timely conflict, a timely topic, a very important and worthwhile cause for consideration. But alas, the characters are as flat as the landscape, and the resolution of the plot is one you can predict before you finish reading the cover blurb."
2,"Good plot, but movie doesn't match it","Another movie from Werner Herzog that's a disappointment. He has a knack for coming up with great sounding plots, but once I sat through this the first time I felt cheated. The movie's plot is interesting in that it deals with man's total disregard for the environment, aboriginal people, and nature. The movie is just sluggish and uncaptiviating. Not recommended."
5,Impressed By the Man's Non Existant Ecclesiology,"Gerhard O. Forde was a brilliant theologian for which all Lutheranism can be thankful. This book a collection of essays, shows his brilliant mind at work.Upon receiving the book I devoured it. It was actually hard to put down. It forces you to look at subjects in completely new light, and is perhaps somewhat a corrective to both the most conservative of Lutheranism, and the most Liberal of Lutheranism.I found especially helpful his essay on the meaning of Satis Est, and its implications for modern Ecumenical dialogue that seems to want to focus on everything but what is actually needed, agreement in the gospel and the sacraments.His other Essays and sermons hammer home salvation by Grace through faith, in clear and compelling language leaving the sinner dead, and bringing the new man to life. Perhaps not all is to be agreed with, but none of it is to be ignored, and the Christian is impoverished for not reading and grappling with this book at all."
4,Mother Gong - 'Live 1991' (Mother Gong),"Heard this CD just once. Believe it was actually recorded on a tour that Mother Gong did of the U.S. in summer 1991. I believe that I, personally know the fan who's responsible for capturing this live show on tape. Total of 18 tracks, with a duration of 74:46. Makes for a nice Gong spin-off project. Tunes here that I was most impressed with were ""In The Beginning"", ""Hungry"" - where Tom The Poet recites a spoken word bit, the quirky ""Big Daddy World"", ""Wild Child"" and ""Wilful Housewife"". Line-up: Gilli Smyth - vocals, Harry Williamson - guitar & keyboards, Rob Calvert - sax and Tom The Poet - recitals. Not a bad cosmic rock title. Definitely, should-have."
1,THE BAG DON'T LOOK AS IT IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I received the bag and this have a green and red colors that you DONT SHOW in your pictures. I need my money back... The bag is awfull!!!!!!!!!!
4,Small Town Saturday Night,"I have to admit the only reason I wanted to watch this movie is because my favorite country singer Wade Hayes has two songs in the movie, one during the movie (Good Day To Go Crazy) and then one playing while credits roll (Population Sign).Place To Turn AroundI really liked the movie but I could do without the foul language. Sometimes I think that takes away from an actors performance. Chris Pine and Shawn Christian were awesome in this movie. I've been a fan of Shawn's for quite some time and this was the first time for me seeing Chris and WOW!I think you will be pleasantly surprised by this movie. I wasn't certain where they were heading with it, I thought it was a movie about a guy moving to Nashville but it's interesting how all the characters lifes are entwined in this movie.Give the movie a view. I think you will be pleasantly surprised and again it contains excellent music."
3,Meh. Ho hum.,I have just started to see Chris Pine in some movies. So I thought I'd check this one out.This movie is kind of boring. No real story there. Just a small town guy looking to leave to follow this dreams. All the other characters are pretty messed up so you'd think he would leave right away but then I guess there wouldn't be a movie at all...
2,Small Town Saturday Night - not so thrilling,"Bought this for my daughter, who is a huge Chris Pine fan. We both were not fond of this movie. Pretty boring with a poor plot."
4,One of Jim Brickman's better efforts,"I really like this CD - Jordan Hill's vocals on the title track and Michael W. Smith on 'You are the Love of My Life' make it even better. This is great music to relax to, with vocals or without"
5,Truely an inspiring artist!,"I am a giant fan of Jim Brickman! I have all of his CD's, except his new release. I think his piano music is the most beautiful music I have ever heard. Bravo, keep up the wonderful Jim Brickman!!!!!"
4,Inspiring,"I have only heard one song on this CD, ""Love of My Life"" with Michael W. Smith, and it was a wonderfully written, emotionally moving piece of music. I can't wait to hear the rest of the CD!!!"
4,Different from the rest of his collection.,"There are a lot more vocals on this disc than his previous works. Some of the songs work well without the voices, though. Brickman has a gift for transforming musical notes into beautiful arrangements. However, the voices detract from teh talent."
4,This is one of the better Brickman albums,"If you buy this album you'll get what Jim Brickman is known for, a lot of good piano playing.Unfortunately here at Amazon you'll only get to sample the first 5 offerings, but they are good. #2 Bittersweet sounds very good, it does have some violin accompaniment, not at all intrusive. #4 Rendevous has Herb Alpert guest accompanying with his trumpet. I like the song but think the trumpet is a little strong at times. #5 Hush little Baby has someone singing, you don't get much vocal work on this album which is fine by me."
1,"He yelled ""WHAT IS THIS CRAP!?""","At the local WalMart you can preview CDs on a listening station. A good friend of mine, put on this album and within seconds loudly exclaimed ""WHAT IS THIS CRAP!"" and threw the CD down in disgust. I work at a gift store that sells this album, and blows have almost ensued over playing it. It is vapid, asinine, torpid, pop-trash. There is nothing of any real musical substance here. If you like piano, check out Robin Spielberg or the classics like Mozart and Beethoven. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BUY THIS!!!!"
4,Hard To Listen To Alone - Needs To Be Shared,"""Destiny"" is the first album I have purchased by Jim Brickman and definitely will not be the last. The vocals were a welcome surprise and added to the overall mood of the album. This album would be good to share with the one you love ...."
3,Brickman's 'Destiny'ideal for family listening!,"Noted for his original songs and a piano style that's fresh, contemporary, yet rooted in the classics, Jim Brickman enjoys a burgeoning national audience. While Destiny doesn't quite capture the charm and pace of his live performances, it's an ample showcase for his obvious talents. Subtle orchestration adds depth and sophistication to the material. With vocal or instrumental help from guest artists Pam Tillis, Herb Alpert, Carly Simon, Michelle Wright and more, Destiny works on several levels and for all ages. There's even a lullabye on each release, (this time, it's Hush, L'il Baby). Want to introduce your family to accessible, quality modern music? Then this fine album is one way to do it."
5,"Relaxing, Soothing, Wonderful","The first time I heard this music was on an international trip. I immediately ran out to buy the album. Now, it is the first thing I listen to when I come into work. Jim Brickman has a way of touching the keys so delicately that you fall into a void while listening to his music. Beautiful music that opens your mind and heart and reminds you of those who have touched your life. A must buy for anyone who is stressed out."
5,Destiny,What an amazing CD. An awesome combination of instrumentals and vocals. The title track is my absolute favorite !!!
4,Too much singing!! Please play the piano only!,"Why spoil a beautiful album with mediocore singing!!! I purchased an album that I knew would be excellent and it was except for the singing!! I would have purchased an album with singing if I had wanted one. I will be careful in the future. If you love Brickman, try John Boswell. Purchase anything.. you'll love it or try John Tesh!!"
2,Average to Boring....,"I borrowed this CD from the local library. I can see why the donator gave it to the library. The CD is too generic when it comes to New Age music. Most of the instruments sound authentic (nothing too synthetic) but the music itself sounds cliché' and inside the cd cover the insert pops out to a poster of Jim. With the way this product is marketed I find it makes Jim appear egotistical and cocky (if that truly is the case). There isn't a wide arrangement of instruments, I know that it's trying to sell as a piano featured CD, but without a variety of instruments almost all the songs sound the same (and even in similar keys). Personally I find it boring to listen to, but I know that others would enjoy this."
4,For my body only?? Truth...for My special body!,"Finally, a guide to 'my' chemistry. I always thought that we were different from each other. And we are! Way back when vanity first began in my then young body, I felt that there was a code and that it could be cracked if someone understood the chemisty. My chemistry. Well...Dr. Tefft and his method address my body and yours...differently. Thank goodness...It's about time! Feeling better already...with energy. Even at 50. It's not too late!A BIG thank you to Dr. Gregory Tefft!"
2,Not great,"It's cheap, but to view an LCD screen through it on my car stereo deck (I didn't get this for a Palm) it's pretty crappy."
5,Quick Delivery,"Couldnt be more impressed, delivered within a week and was very securly packaged. Terrific service!"
5,Fresh,Baby blue jeans is a fresh lemmon and baby powder scent. After is settles it becomes smooth. Versus is a versace brand. It just so happens that this brand was switches over to versace's versus lable. You cant go wrong. You only live once
1,Better know what you are getting,"It is a great looking book, but that's where everything good about it ends. The book is big and has great animation but it's not really about cooking. Granted, it has recipes but nothing particular stands out. Also, it skips a fundamental step, FIRE. What is the best way to set it up, best wood to use, how to manage it?I was disappointed."
5,It will make you fall in love with slow food.,"The Magic of Fire is that rare coffee-table sized book -- it's the one you are going to use for more than just drooling over the pretty pictures. (Mind you, the pictures are quite droolworthy.) Rubel carefully describes the techniques of hearth cookery, and then provides a number of recipes to practice upon. Tantalizing glimpses of how fire is and has been used around the world add more spice. A must read for anyone who loves traditional foods, or even just the warmth of a good fire. I recently took my copy with me to the mountains, just because I'd have a chance to play with a campfire, something I can't do at home, and found myself looking at the fire in whole new ways."
3,Time money and skill required,"Time required: 12 to 16 hoursMoney required in addition to this item: roughly $330Skill: I'm no ace carpenter so I read and re-read the instructions to make sure I was not making a mistake. I didn't do a perfect job. Some would say that I'm good with my hands. I'd say that maybe I'm above average but not nearly as good as some. Still, without practice with making accurate cuts at angles etc. it's doubtful that you'd be able to do nearly as well as just buying a unit for a few hundred more that was factory made.Fun factor: if you like building things and assembling things though there's a certain amount of fun that comes with doing it yourself and being able to say ""I did this""."
2,Low quality swings,"I received a package of two swings, bolts, nuts, flat washers, etc. However, flat washers and nuts are short. In the middle of building swing set, I had to go to local hardware store to buy them. That was very annoying and waste of my time. So, make sure you have it all before start to build yours. I would recommend to buy extra carriage bolts, nuts and washers.The quality of swings are very low. I am 175 lbs and it can hold me. But, I don't feel safe from its appearance. For 3-5 year old kids it should be fine. For bigger kids the chains are off from seats sometimes. I know how tough those kids can play on that. But, it's actually easy to come off."
4,Careful,I received this package in a timely manner but parts were missing. Very discouraged that I had to go to hardware store to find replacement parts that are not readily available. I also don't know who to call to find out about swing parts that are missing... Be careful when ordering.
4,Good alternative to expensive kits,"This was a great alternative to all those expensive kits that come with all the pre-drilled and pre-cut pieces. The directions say that for the top beam if you can't find that size of wood you can screw two smaller beams together. My advice is to find the one size that it calls for. We combined two smaller beams and ended up replacing it with one solid piece. It's too hard to drill where there are two beams and it didn't seem nearly as sturdy until after we replaced it with one beam. All in all, it's a good value."
4,Meditative,"Both this book and Turning the Mind into an Ally are meditative, and encourage contemplation. While I am mostly turned away by ""self-help"" books, or books resembling these, Mipham's approach is thoughtful, and his assessments of human being often accurate. Of course, anyone who is serious about self-betterment will realize that a book--any book--can only take you so far. I treat this text as a starting point. It's a place I go to remind myself of the simplicity of being."
5,Wonderful!,This is my favorite book. It can change your life by teaching you to be more in control of your thoughts. I read it at least once a year. It is simply written. I am going to have my teenage son read it.
1,Understanding your world should come first.,"Ruling without sufficient understanding has led to enormous difficulties in human history.If we truly understood our world, and wanted to help it and the people in it -- then developing intelligent networks would make more sense than creating authoritarian hierarchies."
4,a useful book,this is a useful book for environmental planners and people who are concerned with environmental planning. its full coverage of environmental issues can help to understand these problem well.
5,"Great, couldn't be better!",The book is very clean. It has helped me do well in my class because it arrived on time. Thank you!
1,"A book about acronyms, mostly","Really, that's mostly what the textual information in this volume amounts to. After all, what were you expecting from such a great title as ""Environmental Land Use Planning and Management""? The content suffers from the same pedagogical lackadaisical tone that most of the tomes in this genre trend towards. It would seem that John hired a couple copywriters and instructed them where to start. But don't worry, if you have insomnia you might have just found your cure!"
1,Washed out colors,This was the first time I have tried a non OEM ink cartridges in my printer. Output appeared washed out and green.
4,Bible Time Nursery Rhyme Book,"I ordered this book new and it was delivered damaged. I returned it to seller. I glanced through the book and it seemed to be good, although the illustrations were not that great. Customer service from seller was very good and prompt."
5,What a rush!,"I have never been compelled to write a review. Until now. This CD is a brilliant trip - a frightening voyage into the unknown. Turn off the lights, put on your headphones, and let go. You will be impressed."
2,Lack of a review section + too much hist. documents = bad,"I bought this book in preparation for the AP test. Thankfully, I recognized the fact that this book is completly worthless and I litereally gave the book to a friend, who did not have one at the last minute. This is the worst review book that BArrons has put out becuase it does not review any of the actual history and focusses way too much on the analytical part dealing with essays. The AP US test prides itself on the need to understand the facts in US history through the entire exam (the multiple choice questions test specific topics and the essay questions require teh incorporation of outside information). Do not rely on this book if you are aiming for anytyhing higher than a 2."
1,THIS BOOK [IS BAD],"DON'T GET THIS BOOK! All it has are other people's essays and some questions. Although the answers to the questions are available, as well as the explanation, it does not help! There is NO information about US History. It was a big disappointment. [....]"
3,A Disappointment,"This book was a complete disappointment. This book had no review material at all. 95% of the book was a tutorial on how to analyze and respond to the various types of essay questions. The book was divided up into sections, with about 5 possible essay questions for each of the various time periods in U.S. History. The book then gave a sample response to one of the essay question and teacher comments. This book also explained how to analyze multiple choice questions.There was only one full practice exam included. Also included were a glossary of key terms and a chronological timeline of important dates.Do not buy this book if you want review material or have a good understanding of how to answer essay and multiple choice questions. This ""review manual"" will only be useful to a person who does not feel comfortable with there ability to comprehend what an essay or multiple choice question is looking for."
3,Fair.,"The tips for writing essays are excellent. However, they are mostly common sense tips that AMSCO APUSH has. The review section is lousy. The lists of events mean nothing and many of the names listed under key names will never be on the APUSH exam. The first part of the book gives tons of tips on how to study history but the review chapter (only one) neglects those tips by just listing events chronologically. The questions, however, are realistic like PR and AMSCO questions. However, AMSCO has more questions and AMSCO also has lots of review. Don't bother buying this book, unless you want more questions."
2,ehhh....not worth the 12 bucks,"this book was not very helpful in preparing for the exam. the practice tests and timeline in the back of the book were extremely helpful, but the essays were terrible! any student should know that an essay should be way more organized than those in the book! their tips were not helpful at all. my friends had a book that had something like 10 tests in it - this was a good study tool. you can also find practice tests all over the internet. find something that will tell you the basics about the test, and maybe a timeline, but most u.s. history courses should cover enough that this book won't be helpful. i feel confident that i got at least a 4 on the test, but only because i studied with kids who had books besides this."
3,"No Review of Material, Only one Practice Test","this book is pretty good, and it has a nice chronology of events in the back. nevertheless, the chronology lacks some important elements, and the book contains very little review of the course (other than the chronology). There is only one practice test, and generally i prefer to have multiple tests, and there is no diagnostic test. There are numerous practice questions, which are pretty good, but I personally felt this book could really use more course review."
3,Not that good of a book,"I bought this book to review for my AP Exam, but unfortunately it didn't prepare me at all. I mean, it does a good job by explaining the different types of essay questions that may appear but that is all. There is only one Pracitice Exam and a few multiple choice sections. I really didn't like the outline either... Instead of getting this book, I would recommend the REA addition which contains 6 practice tests and a COMPREHENSIVE review of almost every event in U.S. history. After getting the REA book, I never touched this book after. Although, I haven't recieved my AP Exam grade (for some mysterious reason), I know for a fact that the REA book helped me prepare more than this one."
2,"Not Enough Historical Information, Too Many Student Essays","My mom bought this book so that I could study for the AP U.S. History test, but I was a bit disapointed. I was hoping to get a thourough review of history, but instead, the sections on historical time periods list only questions that you SHOULD know the answers too without giving you the facts. For every chapter, there is a sample student essay with teacher critiques. Reading one or two essays might be helpful, but reading student essays won't help me to understand the history. I am already a good writer. What I need is to review the facts.My Thompson's/Peterson's SAT II Prep book has been much more helpful since it includes concise summaries of key people and events for each time period (even though I bought it to study for a different test).This book is helpful in learning how the test works and has some useful practice questions, but if you want to review the history, this is not the book for you."
1,Awful,"I recently purchaced this book and returned it. I attempted to study for the test by brushing up on the history. Yes history! Well, it was nonexistant in this book. It was just a big fat tip book for scoring a 5 on the AP exam."
2,Not a book for a quick review,I wouldn't highly recomend this book for students who want a quick fact review before the exam. The book would however be good for students who might have trouble writing or organizing essays. The only part of the book I found really helpful was the outline at the back of the book which goes over such things as causes of various wars and famous people. I used that to review the nigh before the exam. But be forwarned if you do buy this bok to help you with the essay it will take you a while to read!
3,No Review Section,"I wanted a comprehensive review before the exam. Barron's had more tedious questions rather than something to read. I made a 5, but there are better books. The Princeton Review or REA (if you read quickly) is more helpful."
4,Great Performance TV,"I got this 2 days back. By this I moved from 29"" to 42"" - what a jump - life looks pretty cool now!!!This TV is just great. Picture resolution is good. Easier to hook. Little heavier than I thought. My wife had to give me a hand and she struggled too. Easier to install.Pros:1. Very slim.2. Various view modes3. Can use TV speaker as Center speaker for the receiver - GREAT!! This itself saved me straight $200+4. Parental locking feature seems to lot advanced - havent used it yet5. Digital input and HDTV ready.6. Affordable price - good bang for the buck7. Picture off feature is great.... You can use the speakers but not burn the plasma screen unnecessarily.Cons1. No Picture in Picture - not sure if it is a standard in all plasma TVs2. Lack of SD Card kind of input - Took one star out for this...3. Gets hotter quickly - not sure if all Plasma have this problem4. TV remote doesnt seem to work with other equipments - maybe I did it wrong....(...)Mahesh"
2,Consider purchasing a different model.,"After owning this unit for just over one month it developed an annoying hiss.Sony's repair service initially diagnosed the problem as a faulty video board. A new video board was installed but proved defective.The repair service man plans to return to put in another video board, but they are no longer sure that this will solve the problem. The repair service gentleman's second guess is that the annoying sound may be coming from two internal fans, in which case they say that we'll just have to live with the problem.Beware of this unit. The hiss that we hear can be heard from two rooms away and is a constant reminder that we purchased an inferior product.p.s.In case you think that we are bashing Sony, think again. In the past we have enjoyed many of Sony's products. While we may purchase other Sony products in the future, we recommend that others stay away from this particular unit."
3,Beware--Defective Copy,"The copy I received has duplicate pages 193-224 and is missing pages 249-256 (a good part of the ""drop cookie"" section).Maybe that's why the price was so good?Unfortunately, I didn't notice this until the 30 day return window had expired, so it doesn't pay to return.Aside from this, it's a wonderful collection of cookie recipes--probably the only one you'd need--if you're lucky enough to receive the entire book. There are even recipes for long-forgotten Italian favorites my relatives used to make years ago.I've contacted KAF to see if they'll rectify the problem, but I'm guessing they'll tell me I should have bought it from them, directly."
5,Wonderful addition to any cookbook library,"My copy was an early Christmas present which arrived in plenty of time for holiday baking. There are lots of tempting cookie recipes with numerous options...many are very easy to follow. The book is also an excellent source of baking information. Definitely a great compendium.One of the things that I noticed about the recipes is that the amount of sodium (salt, baking powder, baking soda) is a lot less than any other cookie recipes. Having switched to a low sodium lifestyle, I really appreciate how these recipes were developed with this in mind, without impacting the final results, especially taste.I'm glad I asked ""Moma Santa"" for it. Thanks, Mom!"
5,Look no further,The King Arthur Cookie Companion will not disappoint! I have made seven of the cookie receipes and every one of them were wonderful! If you want options - this book has them. It is the best cookie book I have seen.
2,Big disappointment!,The cookies were dry. The recipes sounded good but when made the results were disappointing. The cookies were dry and stiff or difficult to reproduce-- the bullseye in particular.I would not reccommend purchasing this.
5,when reading this you are in cookieland,"I have been searching for a book that gives you wonderful recipes,but goes beyond. This book is a great teaching tool.Full of so much help and great tipsA must have."
5,All you need to know about cookies,"I love this book for a variety of reasons. It's comprehensive, covers the chemistry that makes baked goods delicious, is written in a friendly (but not too folksy) manner and best of all, offers recipe variations for soft and crispy cookies. (My husband loves the former; I, the latter.) It's also great reading if you love food history and culture, and it made me want to be part of the delightful King Arthur Family. I highly recommend this to all who love cookies and baking.Bazaar Baker"
3,Beautiful to look at but try not to read it,"Visually, this book is beautifully produced and designed, and a joy to flip through. It's easily one of the very best fusions of contemporary Middle Eastern/Islamic history, politics and art that's been published. The text, though, is some of the densest bunch of lit crit, post-modern gibberish I've come across. Still, the visual half of the book succeeds brilliantly and makes it worth purchasing."
5,Hill Street Blues Season 2,This is a classic police series with alot of characters.It can also be enjoyed by all the family without shocking people I can highly recomend this
4,Wonderful,"Wonderful, just as we remembered the show. Made my husband happy. Nice set for anyone who is a Hill Street Blues fan."
4,Sound a little disappointing,Wonderful to see the old episodes again. Wish there was season 3. Would be nice if it indicated the year of season one.
5,Great Release of Classic TV show Writing and Characters,"Season 2 along with Season 1 are great releases but FOX may decide not to release more seasons of Blues they say sales are low... FOX seems to love to play this game release a TV show and never finish the releases.... There was DYNASTY (now Paramount has the rights maybe a release in early 2007) .. MARY TYLER MOORE ... How long did it take for season 2 ! Now where is season 5? COME ON FOX don't release a few seasons and stop! It looks as though FOX is set to release another cop drama PICKET FENCES in 2007 This is GREAT news HOWEVER ... Why does FOX think that those sales will be better than Blues? No offense to either show, FOX just likes to release a few seasons of every show they can and never finish releasing other seasons. Why Release Picket Fences when they can't release all of HILL STREET BLUES? come on FOX follow thru don't let your customers down .. release more Blues and FENCES but release them all."
5,One of the Best TV Shows,"This Show was my favorite, I was looking forward for the release on DVD, this is THE FATHER of the COP's Shows."
5,Let's Be Careful out there,"Hill Street Blues was the first Police series that truely depicted what goes on in the station and out on the streets. It shows the personalities of several groups of officers both on and off the job and also touches on the dark side that some Police officers have.The writing and plots are superb, and the actors couldn't have been better. Charactor's like Renko, Belker, and Lt. Hunter, head of the SWAT Team are priceless. It shows very deep emotions both tragic and comic at the same time, and showed the vulnerabilities that Police officers do have and that they are human afterall.As a former Police Officer myself I cannot say enough about the quality and realism of Hill Street, and over the years only NYPD Blue has come close to equaling Hill Street.The Disc quality is outstanding and there are some extra's. It is a must for any fan of Police or Criminal Dramas, and is truely a ground breaking series."
5,I get the blues,"One of the best series never made.All is great in this show : characters (except Davenport), actors, stories, musics...I don't see better until now.Please, I want all others seasons !!!!!!A French FAN ;)"
2,Disappointing compared to the first volume,"The sound quality is great and the playing is top-notch. However, only a handful of tracks here (including ""Caroline, No"" Elliot Easton, ""Liz & Opie"" Victor Wooten, ""Wings of the Morning"" Doyle Dykes and maybe one or two more) seem inspired. Taken on it's own terms, the collection overall sounds pleasant enough but the weaker tracks come across as being here just for the project theme- to demo the Taylor Guitar sound. If you can only get one of the two volumes, Vol. 1 is absolutely the one to go with. This one is for serious guitar enthusiasts only or music collectors/completists who want these tracks because they may not be available elsewhere."
5,Beautiful music,"If you like, even just like, acoustic guitar you will like this record. The perfect record for a candlelight dinner or peaceful quite evenings. I love just about every song on this record. Lovely, intricate guitar playing.Listening to this record on the couch, with the lights off and my eyes closed, makes me feel like I am lying by a crackling creek, in the grass, under a blue sky, temperature about 80 degrees, when I was ten years old."
3,"great, colorful soft block set","Although there are only 6 (and these arent cheap) this is a great, well made block set for baby. They're colorful and feature different textures and images including the black and white ones babies can focus on. they're wonderful for stacking and then having baby knock down and a few rattle and crinkle for even more infant interaction. they've held up well so would recommend despite the $$. cool pictures, colors, and feel for baby."
2,"Poor fit, cheaply made.","These didn't fit properly. They were just a little bit off, but enough to easily notice, especially while installing. I had to decide to cover the window fully, or have this fit in its intended spot. I had to bend these to get them to fit. About 15% of the 3M tape is serving no purpose because of improper fit. From far away, these look fine. They do their job keeping rain out and they are still hanging on, so 2-3 stars based on that."
2,Li-ion battery for Samsung SCH-A670,"This battery is advertized as being equivalent to the standard battery supplied with a new phone. Unfortunately, the standby time with this one is only about 50% of the standby time with a new Samsung-brand battery. On the plus side, this battery does allow one to continue to use the phone and the price cannot be beaten."
3,Should be only 2.5 stars,"I this straightener because of the ceramic plates and are able to use it on DAMP hair. So far I have used it 4 times. It heats up nice and hot and flattens my waves, however it doesn't glide through your hair like my other straighteners. Actually, it pulls my hair out because they get caught in something which I haven't been able to identify yet. As for the steam vents so you may use it on DAMP hair (notice I said DAMP and not wet hair), I didn't see or feel anything different from my other straighteners. Also, this appliance doesn't ""sit"" nicely and falls over when you put it down to grab another section of hair. I don't want to use this anymore will probably give it away. The positive points of this straightner are the reasonable price and long electrical cord."
2,Not good!,"I purchased this at more than half off, and never liked it. It pulled my hair and didn't glide through my hair like the FHI I have (which is great). It felt really rough on my hair and I would not recommend it."
2,What happened to the old one?,"I've used an earlier model of this stand (from the early '90s) and it was *much* sturdier. The top on this one is so flimsy that a thick book placed on one side causes it to bend. I guess it's functional if you only put sheet music on it, but it's a waste of an otherwise well-made foundation."
5,Nice stand,This stand easily holds 4 sheets at a time. Great for two people to have their own sheets at one time or for those pieces that have multiple sheets (less page turning!)
2,Mehhhhh.....,Slightly interesting but not much else. No footage at all just interviewing witnesses and some comical recreations of witness accounts.
2,Ouch.,"If you do not have super thin toes, do not buy. When I recieved the item, I excitedly put it on. It was fine for the first 2 minutes then it began to pinch. Also, when I went to remove the toe ring, it almost broke.But other than that, its pretty."
3,"Beautiful, but not for fat toes","I agree with everything the person said it the review titled ""Ouch."" My toes are about a size 5 and this toe ring wasn't very comfortable and it pinched. Also it was realllly hard to take off, and doesnt bend easily at all. mine almost broke too. but its so pretty ): im so sad"
5,channel set cz toe ring,"I new I would love this toe ring, from the minute I opened the package and saw the precious blue velvet drawstring bag it came in. It is adorable and looks so real. It is also very comfortable. I will definately buy from this company again."
5,Simply lovely!,"Wonderful experience all around: great product, terrific price, shipped quickly and packaged very nicely in a nice little velvet bag. Great if you're thinking of getting someone a nice little gift. Beautiful sterling silver with good quality CZ stones. Haven't taken it off since I got it."
4,Toe Ring,"I was happy with the look and feel of this product. However, if you do decide to order it, be careful not to over stretch the band. I bought 20 of them for friends and a few of them have broken in half."
4,A CostaRican folktales,"I would love to read this book in class so I would enjoy singing the ""Dias de la semana"" in Spanish to my students. It is very interesting, how there are authors that even though they are not Latinos or from Latino descendant, are interested in folktales around the world. I also like the lesson shown at the end of the story."
2,Cute puppet but...,"I think a twenty word review would be longer than the book. The undersea setting is intriguing, but not surprising for a story about a generic crustacean (Snappy), the main character. While the plot was quite linear, but there was no back story for Snappy. There was little conflict, but there was some suspense. The resolution was not satisfactory. (Plus, my dog ate the puppet.)"
2,NOT a Capacitive Stylus,"It's an awesome idea. The pen and the pencil are both great. However, despite the fact that this thing keeps showing up when I search for a ""capacitive stylus,"" it is NOT a capacitive stylus. If you can use your screen with more than 1 finger, this is not the stylus for you."
1,Pilot touch screen stylus,"I bought this for my iPad (touch screen, right?!?), neither my iPad, iPhone, nor iTouch recognizes this stylus. This product CANNOT be used with any of these products. Very misleading."
3,Does not work with Droid,I should have known this but the stylus does not work with a droid. The idea is great and would have avoided the constant screen smearing caused by using a finger but it did not work.
3,"Good, Could be better.","The PILOT Pentopia works great for what it's used for however for the price I was expecting some better quality control from PILOT.I have always liked PILOT products however when I used my Pentopia for the first several times I was very disappointed to find that the Ballpoint Pen aspect of this 3 in 1 did not work. It required me to purchase a replacement just to use this pen as it was intended for.For the price I am not statified with the need to purchase extra items to use something which should work ""out of the box"" for at least a month of light use."
5,Samuel Pepys.. The full picture,This book is easy to read and gives a good picture of the man as well as the difficult times he wrote in (late 16th century). Personally I like it better and found it easier to read than Pepys' diaries. I would recommend if anyone plans to read the diaries to read this book first and so gain a clearer over-all picture.
5,Presents Great Character with Great Clarity,"2003 -- the 300th anniversary of Pepys death -- accidentally turned into the year of Pepys for me after I bought the audiobook version of his diaries read by Kenneth Branagh.I fell in love with the diaries (read so well by Branagh), but was frustrated by my lack of knowledge about Restoration London. So, I did some reading in other history books, but eventually found this book. Tomalin has written a very clear biography that manages to give enough of the historical context without slowing down the personal narrative.Better educated, I listened to the audiobook diary again and enjoyed them even more than the first-time around!I highly recommend both the audiobook and this biography to anyone interested in becoming acquainted with a man who is fascinating and charming and frequently amoral, but remarkably honest! 1660 London doesn't seem so long ago or so foreign to me anymore!"
1,Silly & Reckless,"The author states that she's writing this book to help people understand kundalini. While I appreciate her intention, this book promotes reckless techniques that promise instaneous kundalini awakening just by deciding to turn it on. The author promotes the erroneous idea that kundalini is set up like a heater's thermostat that you simply adjust by turning metaphysical knobs. Thankfully, as most responsible spiritual teachers advise, kundalini is not so easily tampered with. The techniques simply do not work and are a complete waste of time. My advice is to go online and get some responsible, effective tips that are safe and actually work from serious, respected spiritual teachers. You don't need a guru for kundalini but you don't need this book's unfounded advice either."
1,What a Load of Rubbish!,"Jeanie Mack I cannot believe I actually paid 40 dollars for this rubbish. This woman goes on and on about how scary kundalini can be unless of course, you've got her (and her gargantuan ego) and her book to save you from its evils. On and on she goes about the evils that happened to people who didn't listen to her advice. Of course, when she gives it it's not advice--no, from what I gather in her book when she speaks, it's actually the word of God Herself. And if you don't believe me or her, she'll sit you right down and ""connect"" you to God, Jesus, Mary or whoever who always agrees with whatever clap has come out of the author's mouth.It's amazing what owning a printing press can do for a person (and their ego!)"
1,"Kundalini Rocks, This Book Doesn't","Wanna have an author make you believe she's the foremost authority on the subject and scare you into believing that without her fabulous knowledge the flame of kundalini will rip you to shreds? Wanna be lured into a cult? Wanna have a meglomaniac convince you that she's got all the answers? Wanna spend hundreds and thousands of dollars ""learning techniques"" that the author herself states are simple kindergarten exercises? Then get started reading Mary Ellen Flora's books!Flora promotes her books as the answer to gurus when in fact all she's doing is offering the same stuff that you get get for free on any of 10 billion web pages.What Flora does offer that you'll find nowhere else is a gateway into her cult of a ""psychic school"" that you too can join and then be forced into writing bogus reviews to keep her ego stroked."
5,Loved it !!!!,I loved the book. It really helped me. It is simple but has a ton of excellent information. Everything that is written is done so that I can read it without getting confused or overwhelmed. The book has really assisted me in my spiritual growth.
1,Kundalini: This Book Should Go Up in Flames,"This book are promotes one thing and one thing only: fear. Fear of kundalini, (don't believe me, check out her review asking you to google kundalini--not for wisdom, but to find scary stories.) Without her or her sage wisdom kundalini will flame up scare you to death and God knows what else. Only she cares enough to demystify the experience and keep you free from needing gurus. What you will need, however, to keep you safe are her classes which cost hundreds of dollars. Please keep away from this manipulative author."
5,Kundalini Rocks!,"Bravo to Ms Flora for demystifying Kundalini. Prior to reading her book, I had quite a bit of fear about this powerful energy (try Google-ing kundalini for some good scary stories). With my first read of this book (all in one night, I might add), I was able to access and work with my kundalini in a safe, productive way - and now I can't get enough. Folks, this energy can really change your life! This book is an essential read if you are curious about Kundalini and want to try it for yourself."
3,Girlfriend,I will review anything that I here are see.This is the latest single by the Black Boy Band B2K this is just there latest single for the little 12 year old african american female teenyboppers to bob to not close to Uh HuhLyrics 7/10 Production 4/10 Overall 5.5/10
4,"Scarey, Creepy, Great Ending.","English horror film abuot a hypnotist up against a sort of demonic spirit who learns scientifically and spiritually how to be reborn in other bodies to essentially live forever. This movie will scare the crap out of you. It is smart, well acted and fun."
1,Don't Close Your Eyes Or You'll Fall Asleep,"Somebody just woke me up to give this review. I fell asleep watching this movie because it was so boring, but I did rewind to finish it so I could give a fair review. It's a story about a hypnotist who is helping the cops track down a serial killer. He can see what others see. Sounds great right? Trust me, it's not great at all. I am glad to give this movie it's first 1 star review. If it was up to me I would give it 0 stars. The acting was horrible. The story was silly. It wasn't scary or suspenseful. The ending was so bad that it made me chuckle. Not to mention that the final twist was very predictable. I would have expected something much better from BBC than this failure at a horror movie. Don't waste your time seeing this film. In fact, don't waste your time reading any more of my words about how bad it is. Keep moving along... nothing to see here. I think the writer and director had their eyes closed when they created this garbage."
1,Close your eyes,"I was very dissappointed that when I tried to view the DVD I could not, as it could only be viewed in Region 2, and I live in Ireland not America. This was clear on my order as my address is in Ireland. I would like a replacement DVD or my money refunded"
3,Good film that warrants a closer look,"Close Your Eyes is a creepy little film. And that is what it is intended to be - a creepy little thriller.We have a hypnotherapist who can help people quit smoking. He and his family have just moved to London from the U.S. because of some problem which we are not immediately told about. During a session with a female detective, he accidentally reveals his ability to see into people's minds. She blackmails him into assisting her on a serial murder case where one young girl managed to escape from the killer. The kid's in shock and not talking and they need to catch the killer before he kills again.It has a good pace, and excellent production values along with very good acting. It's not a big budget or big name picture, but frankly I find that blockbusters are usually lackluster. It's the workmen films that really deliver - and this does.Check it out."
2,Only for those with good ears...,"""Close Your Eyes"" is a fine suspense story with hints of the supernatural and more than ample gore. I'd probably rate it a 3 or 4 star DVD but it was, strangely, lacking captions for the hearing-impaired (which includes those of us who have difficulty comprehending some severe British accents). Amazon's listing shows ""closed captions"" but the only captions are in Spanish."
1,Warning! NOT Closed-Captioned,"The product details show that this is closed-captioned. It has Spanish subtitles, but NO closed captions. If you depend on them like I do, buying this is a waste of your money."
2,"Yes, it's copper.","All five pieces failed to meet the minimum length and width of 4 inches. All five pieces exhibited moderate to severe scratches on both sides despite the protective film. The 12 oz sample was slightly bent. If you are looking for jewelry quality copper sheet, shop elsewhere."
1,Mirror too small,"I bought this mirror a few months ago and reviewed it I believe directly to the vender. I found this mirror too small to be of any use if one stood it on a dressing table. I was unable to comb my hair or put on make up using both hands. If I had to use this mirror it would have to be hand held, not much larger than a compact. Perhaps I made a mistake when I viewed it on the computer and thought it much bigger than it is. Would not recommend it to anyone, unless they just wanted a hand held mirror and then why not just use a compact mirror. Sorry..."
1,Disapointment,"I bought this pack for my nephew for a Christmas present. We were unable to get any of the DVDs to play on any of our players. They would not play on any DVD player, computer or our PS2. I don't know why. My nephew was very disapointed."
5,A must for any Newsboys Fan,"This is a GREAT live concert recording of the Newsboys doing what they do best! If you know them, then you already know how good they are and if you don't know them, you won't be reading this anyway, so I don't think anything else needs to be said. If you're a fan, you must purchase this!"
3,do not buy,if you are going to waist mony this robot then go to E-clec-tech and spend $160.00 on a pino dx.
3,A little on the pricey side...,"Don't get me wrong or nothing, Robosapien is totally fun to mess around with. None of the functions work quite as well as I would like them to, but they're all still pretty cool. Getting him out of the box is annoying, but it's not too different from some other toys and boxes you've had to deal with before. The control is a trip. It looks like a huge universal remote to control your house or something, but no - just Robosapien.I'm going to go with these other peeps. Wait for v2 and try to find it on sale."
3,"OK, But Not Great","The reason I rated this three stars Is because at first when you just get it, it's fun to play with, but after about one week it gets SO boring."
4,What did you expect?,"If you are expecting this toy to do your laundry you will be very disappointed.If you are expecting this toy to excite your actual or inner child I believe you will be pleased with its purchase.The Robosapien and its (discontinued) big brother are exceptional bits of robotics engineering. To get this much functionality at such a low price is a major accomplishment. Its entertainment value is good, but relatively short lived compared to the educational value as a learning tool for programming and animatronics.Once you get tired of playing with it you should take it apart to see how it was designed and built. This is the most educational part of this toy. If this doesn't get your child interested in mechanical or electronic engineering I suggest you consider a piano as your next purchase."
2,Awesome toy!.......for about 20 minutes!!,"I got this originally for my 5 year old who is now 12. He played with about 20 minutes then its over and forgotten about. Then we had two more kids, a boy and a girl. Girl is 6 now and boy 5. Same deal they pretty much think awesome....for 20 minutes then forgotten about. It doesn't keep kids attention very long. To me it seems like a such a cool toy but the proof is in the pudding as they say and I have now tried it on all three kids and its a no-go, now headed for yard sale or sale online. Very disappointed in, considering the price. Keep your money and keep looking. All three of my kids have loved legos and the little lego action figures. We would have done much better getting legos instead of this. Same for the Roboraptor, we tried it too and for our kids neither one was a hit. If you do decide to try it and your kids don't play with it much, don't keep it like I did thinking maybe 'later' they will play with it more because mine never did."
2,"Unfortunately, Disappointed, Expected a different & Great toy!","After receiving the Robosapien (purchased in November) I had wrapped the gift for the Holidays and there was no way of testing this product prior.Unfortunately, from great expectations the remote does not work, I am still working with the company to come to a resolution on receiving a replacement remote and have gone through a lot of communication, and two months later have not been able to use the toy.Recommendation: If you plan on giving as a gift, it would be a good idea to open the toy and conduct a simple test to ensure no disappointment occurs."
3,"OK, But Not Great","The reason I rated this three stars Is because at first when you just get it, it's fun to play with, but after about one week it gets boring."
4,Robosapien Rules!!!,Robosapien is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!! He is SO realistic!! He can do EVERYTHING!! He even toots!
3,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"I got this gift for Christmas this year and I was SUPER excited! The first ten minutes were great. After that there was nothing else to do with it. My cousins thought it was cool when they came over for the Christmas party, but then after ten minutes with them they got bored. Then the next day I tried using one of the arms and it wouldnt move properly or open! I did NOT drop it, DID NOT shake it! And I did NOT move the arm manually. So now we have no use for it and my little brother uses it for completely stupid things. Maybe I might be lucky and get something cooler like a Roboraptor, or even a Robosapien V2!"
4,Quite amazing - even for a skeptic like me,I'm a single mom who gave this to her 9 year old son for Christmas. Yes - this robot was quite a bother to get out of the package - good thing I didn't have to return it. My 9 year old was very pleased with it (and still is). We've just barely touch on all the functions of the toy. He just enjoys seeing it dance. One thing I must say is - I'm glad I got it. I hit it lucky and found an all-gold one at Spencer's - which seems more like a robot than the one that is white and black. (...)
5,This Toy Rocks!!!,"I bought this toy for my 7 year old son and he loves it. The biggest problem he has with it is getting my husband to put it down! My son's favorite features are the farting and burping abilities. My 3 year old daughter loves to watch it dance. It has some difficulty with picking up objects, but can pick up the cup that comes with it fairly easily. We have had it for about a month now and my kids still love it!"
4,Good toy for the price,"I bought two for my kids and they loved them. I am using them to teach them how to think when top down programming. We play games by having them write steps to do certain functions move and place items in specific spots, or navigate through obsticles. The only negative I see so far is that when you have multiple units they cannot respond seperately to their own controllers. I should have only purchased one."
4,Very delicate,This toy is expencive and very woth while but the first day your like cool this is the best toy ever but the second day you love it more than after a month or year it starts to break down now my robot cant open his left hand or move his head. well now they have a new upgraded robo thats reflective and doesnt have as many bugs but u must buy this before any other robot for starters it helps you learn more about how wowee works on they're robots so u should buy this first.
2,Weak,Looks cool but really doesnt do much.Walks very slow. Maybe 1 foot in a minute and takes about a minute or two to turn around 180 degrees. Very hard to pick up objects as the hands do not reach very low and it can't carry anything weighing more than a paper cup or a pencil. Many of the limbs are articulated together so like when the robot want to grab somehting it can only do it to near its ankle at its side while leaning. The voices all sound like a grunt so not much personality. Version 2 of this coming out fall 2005 with some other variations like a dinosaur and dog that may move a bit faster so stay tuned.
3,It's fun!!,"Bought this for my robot obsessed 7 year old last year for Xmas after seeing all the videos online at what this guy is capable of, I was pretty impressed. Looking back a year ago and how I HAD TO HAVE THIS for him and how this was going to be the highlight of Christmas it turned out to be the opposite, he's barely played with it and it sits up on his shelf. I think it turned out to possibly be a little too advanced or too much for him so I'm hoping that as he gets older he'll get more into it. It's still a really awesome robot especially if you are capable of adding things to it and programming it, it just wasn't something MY son NEEDED at 7. But as for durability, mechanics etc.. this gets 5 stars."
2,Piece of junk,I asked for this for Christmas last year and since then it hasn't been that great. It probably occupied me for about 20 minutes and then I wanted to play something else. It's get's so boring quickly. I was so dissapointed that I told my mom to take it back. I guess it wasn't really what I thought it would be:(
5,Four-year-old son LOVES it,"If your kid is into robots this is a great one for the price. My four-year old loves it, and has figured it out no problem. A good buy and a great toy."
2,IT BROKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,After one day with this toy I thought it ruled. Then something happened that had convinced me other wise. On the second day It's arm broke. The arm would not open or close. IT was cool for one DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Son played with it once!,"I was more excited about the toy than my son until I took it out the box and started playing around with it. My 12 year old son looked quite bored and I was not very impressed after the first 30 minutes or so. My 9 year old thought it was more interesting, only he had alot of trouble with the commands and grew very frustrated."
1,Over Priced,It would be better if he had wheels rather than those stupid legs. It can't move straight forward on those. It is very fragile too after two days right hand doesn't operate anymore. It's only a kid's toy nothing more. I think i'm just gonna open the cover up and use the interior parts for a school project or smtg.
1,What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was'nt what I expected!Warning don't buy this toy if you have young children in the house or pets.The robosapien be running full speed into them.Your child or pet will be very hurt.Probably a broose or worst.I am currently selling mine [...].That person emailed me and said ""The only reason why im bidding is so I can take it back to that company and tell them whats going on.""I know as much as you do right now because before I got this toy it looked like the greatest thing on Earth.Except it's not!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very Bummed Out,"I purchased this toy today and will return it tomorrow after reading the reviews. Why would a toy maker put rude behavior in something aimed at 8 year olds? I do not want to encourage rudeness in my children. Frankly, I am surprised that the people writing reviews use the f--t word so casually. It's just gross!"
3,Any decent robots for kids?,"My 5 year old was dying for a ""robot"" for Christmas last year.I picked this one out on Amazon as it was one of the only ones that really seemed to fit what I pictured a Robot to be.It really does a lot compared to anything else that I have seen. The batteries also lasted longer than I would have thought for this type of electronics.The only thing that disappointed me was that my son barely ever plays with it except when guests are over to make it pass gas.Maybe it was just my child or maybe he was too young, but I was a little disappointed with the reaction."
3,"Eh, so-so.","This is a neat toy, but not quite as cool as I thought it would be. I got the book to go with it, as I expected to do a lot of neat stuff with it. Well, it is somewhat less programmable than you might expect. I got this for my son, and had planned to use it as a fun learning tool for him. Well, the programming is so limited that you can't really do anything very interesting with this toy. My son has played with it, but not enough to run out a set of batteries yet. The biggest fun he and his friends have had with it is getting it to make the crude noises it will make. Maybe, being an engineer, I just expected too much. I thought the programming would be to a finer level than simply setting up a sequence of pre-programmed actions, but that's all it will do."
3,Toy is fun while it lasts,"I bought this toy for my 6 year old son as a Christmas gift. It was great fun while it worked. My son could easily program it and he was delighted with the different actions and noises that it made. However, after only 5 days of normal use, the toy would no longer work properly. It's leg would not return to its ""start"" position and so would not balance properly. Because it was unable to balance, it could no longer walk, turn, etc. without falling over. I contacted WowWee customer service for a replacement, as per their 90 day warranty; a month later, I am still trying to get them to honor the warranty. This is not a pleasant company to deal with. I would not recommend dealing with this company. In my experience, the cost of this toy is too high considering that it may no longer work in only a few days of play."
1,Received in broken and seemingly used condition,"I bought my Robosapien directly from Wowwee. When it came, it did not appear new, it was a little dirty with marks all over it. And it did not work. It would not walk at all or do anything really but move its arms and burp and fart. What a bummer."
2,Not so great,got these for my boys for Christmas last year - one boy aged 6 1/2 and one 5. Yes they're cool for the first 5 minutes- after that - forget it. They've been very expensive dust collectors. I'm sure all the programming is great.....but not a good toy for younger boys. A waste of money.
2,Not worth the money.,"The robot has some entertainment value when it first comes out of the box, but that goes away fairly quick. The motion is not very fluid, it kinda shuffles to walk, you don't have direct control over opening or closing the hands, it basically only has one pre-programmed pick-up motion. It says that it's programmable, which it is, but it doesn't remember the programming after it shuts off. This simply is not the NASA designed, fluid motion, humaniod robot that I thought I was getting. I would wait till retailers realize this isn't a hundred dollar toy, and get it on clearance for under fifty bucks."
3,"Meh...unless you're rich or a techno-geek, skip it","My seven year old sister decided she wanted this and saved up her money for a year to get it. At the moment, she loves it, but I can just tell she'll be bored of it within a week. Sure, it has some cool moves, but $100? Nope, unless you're rich or a techno-geek who can program it. This is worth maybe $25, not $100."
2,Extremely disappointing,"I was really looking forward to getting this as a present for my son, and what a let down.In Demo mode it has a few cool moves, but thats about it.Very clumsy movements and a complicated remote - can only pick up a supplied plastic container placed in a certain position, and then makes a couple of grunting sounds - big deal!!If this is what we getting from ex NASA employees then it makes one wonder - did we really get to the moon...."
3,What a huge disappointment after reading good reviews.,"I read a small handful of reviews before purchasing two of them for my boys for Christmas. The first few minutes it is pretty ok, but then, it gets really really old shortly thereafter. I have spoken to a few other parents who also got these for Christmas gifts and were disappointed. For $100 or close to that, it should do more than grunt, dance and only attempt to pick things up."
4,Great Robot!!!!!!!,Robosapien is a great robot really fast & funny althohe is very limited on this actions i.e he can only pick up objects the same size as a paper cup . Kids will love him.(...)
2,What the........,"This toy is pretty cool but it is a bit wierd.For example it walks pretty wacky by moving its waist in awkward pistions.It also makes weird sounds when it trys to talk like ohh,eee,uhh.So this thing is pretty fun but really weird.I would rather get somthing less werdoish like Robosapien V2.I would have gave this 4 or even 5 stars if it was not so strange,werid,and well you get the point. If you can't afford V2 you might want to pick this up if you don't mind the weirdness."
1,Only the Uninformed would consider this book documented.,"I first encountered this book when I was attracted to the gaudy cover in the Galeria de los Artesanos in Las Vegas, NM, one of my favorite bookstores since it was operated by truly professional Western book authorities. I asked about the book and they said: ""It's a joke!"" After reading it, I have to agree. The art work is good, done by the author, but if the pages were spread on a gymnasium floor and shelled corn thrown at them, a kernel would seldom miss a historical error. Many of the photos are not who they are claimed to be. Later, in Tombstone where this sort of books sells like mad, I discovered the local bookstores were calling it the Psychedelic Doc. Save your money."
1,Oh dear lord,"This is a terrible book if you're looking for facts, or any kind of reasoning at all. The writer seems to rely heavily on his reputation and his art. The complete lack of bibliography (no, I'm not joking) made me toss this book in disgust."
2,Kinda Boring...,"I made the typical mistake of buying this CD based on reviews and hype. First, the pace of the music is mid-tempo to slow most of the time. Track 5 ""Skippy"" livens things up a little. Otherwise, this sounds to me like a million other piano trio CDs or lounge acts I've heard, nothing new or groundbreaking here, thank you. Bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge Rossy are competent but do nothing overtly interesting. If you're looking for straight ahead traditional piano trio music, this is Ok. Those seeking something new or different should look elsewhere."
1,Oh Come ON!,"Good old Brad Mehldau has once again shown that he can take any pleasant little tune and turn it into something ugly enough to have made Alban Berg wince. This is the kind of stuff that poseurs love to intellectualize about but no one actually wants to listen to. If Bill Evans had been immature, ignorant and narcissistic he would have been Brad Mehldau. Don't waste your money."
1,Waste of Money,"This is not a book, its some type written pages that were copied. The content is stupid. If you want real insight read ""The Brotherhood"" by Aruthur Veno. Its current and accurate."
3,It's an old class lecture with a book cover on it.,"I liked the book.I especially like that it was put together as an instrutor's lecture outline first then a cover was slapped on it to make it a book.But my advise to anyone who is even concidering investigating a motorcycle club or gang is to leave it to the professionals.Do not buy this book,read the investigation techniques in the back,get""hip"" on some terminology used,buy some leathers and think they won't figure you out.They will,and you my friend,are in some deep do-do.One more thing,there are more than six outlaw bike clubs in Illinois,try around sixty,and it didn't even mention a well established Hell's Angles in Chicago.So if it's off that much just think how bad you can get hurt if you use the book as a tool.I do think that the book is great for anyone interested in outlaw bike groups and would like to have some feel for what their about but used any further than that would most likely be a big ""no-no""."
3,An informative look at biker terminology and lifestyle.,"This 43 page publication provides a good look at the terminology and lifestyle of outlaw motorcycle gangs. The book appears to be a training manual used to train law enforcement personnel, and it even includes a chapter at the end of the text on ""investigative techniques."" Other chapters include organizational structure of outlaw motorcycle gangs, their basic philosophies, money-making endeavors, their intelligence network, and even a chapter on the renowned ""motorcycle mama."" Not too much action in this text, but it definitely provides some good insight into the world of the hardcore biker."
4,Nice Band,"He loves how hefty it is (takes it off and shows it to people - feel that? Doesn't it have some heft to it?!) He would prefer it to be a little less round, but finds it comfortable. Would definitely recommend it. :0)"
4,"As long as you know you're getting a reprint, go for it!","Kay Hooper is one of my favorite romance authors, even from when she was writing as Kay Robbins. This is one of her very-hard-to-find Robbins SECOND CHANCE AT LOVE romances (originally published in 1986, #378). It's entertaining (as are all her books!), with appealing characters, great dialogue, etc., although it doesn't have the paranormal/fantasy element of some of her others among my all-time favorites."
4,I Enjoyed This Book,"FROM THE BACK COVER:The worst kind of man-or the best opportunity?Her isolated Colorado cabin was a far cry from the limelight-but that's how bestselling author Erin Scott liked it. Ever since her divorce she steered clear of love, sharing her mountain retreat with only her faithful dog...until Matt Gavin turned up on her front porch. With his piercing gaze and forceful presence, the charming city slicker was just what Erin wanted to avoid. But as he awakened her desire, she gave in to his tender kisses and easy smile-and risked everything for a man who could turn her world inside out..."
5,Toddler loves,"This book mesmerized my 15 month old daughter. To an adult, it seems like it's about nothing. But it's a quiet simple description of a baby/toddler's day. We both like the cadence of the text, she loves pointing out things in the illustrations, and the book mirrors some of her experiences.This is a great in-between book - she was getting bored with the simple board books, but wasn't ready for the wordier picture books. And some picture books are just beyond a toddler's scope of knowledge/understanding. Other books on this same in-between level are BABY TALK by Judy Hindley and TEN LITTLE FINGERS, TEN LITTLE TOES by Mem Fox. I hope Scott Beck writes more like this!"
3,'Wired Injections' (Cleopatra) Various Artists,"Boy, Cleopatra sure knows how to put a good compilation CD together, don't they? The sixteen cuts here features music from industrial, electro wave and goth bands. Tunes I liked the best were Psychic TV's ""I Believe What You Said"", Switchblade Symphony's ""Clown"" and Christian Death's remix of ""Lost Minds"". 'Wired Injections' runs over an hour so you can be sure of getting your money's worth. Not a bad find. Nice cover."
3,Racist is as racist does,"The previous reviewer missed the point of this book entirely. It is the perspective of one man who did not try to apply the sensibilities of today to his recollections of the past. Saginaw was very divided and ignorant of race when Mr Douglas grew up. He writes from that perspective. Thank goodnes we've come as far as we have since then but it is foolish to deny that the old days were as they were or to call his perspective racist when viewed through our ""politically correct"" glasses. I would be fascinated to hear a similar perspective of Saginaw by someone of color. This book is appealing only if you already know your way around Saginaw and that is why I only gave it 3 stars."
2,Not all there,I was pretty disappointed because the kit doesn't have much of what you see. I should have been smart enough to know that the wood wouldn't come with it (although it doesn't say) but it doesn't even come with the slide in the picture.
5,Better than kegels!,"Better than kegels! Easy to follow, effective exercises that are easy to fit into your daily routine. Great for strengthening the pelvic floor and toning the lower abdominal muscles. I highly recommend it to any woman!"
2,Music Train,"It's a good first effort. Two of the songs on the album are good. The production sounds the same on all of the songs, it needs some variety and a little more bass."
3,After the dance. . .,"Most long-time fans will know that this album was released after her journey into dance music so I just wanted to point out to new fans, this is NOT a dance album!"
1,Error,No he comprado este producto. Por lo tanto no puedo emitir juicios al respecto. Espero que puedan solventar este error.
2,Eagles Nest Kit,Not what was advertised on the website. I thought that there would be more material within the kits when it arrived. Will probably return the product to company.
5,Finding Your Father's War,"This is one of the very best all round books you can own. It has unit break downs, ranks, what regiments are in what divisions, dog tag information, research information, just about anything you would need to know to research most any unit or someone in the family. All the information in it, for the price, is one heck of a deal. All the books I've ever seen by Jonathan Gawne are outstanding, especially his 'Spearheading D-Day' book. This book 'Finding Your Father's War' is outstanding."
5,Excellent WWII Resource,"This is a great book to get you started with your WWII research. Even if you are a pro at research, this is a reference work you should keep on the shelf. I just love this book and it has helped me immensely in understanding the research sources available and what things actually mean."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Everyone who wants to know what their relatives did in WWII, this is the book. It has amazing clarity, pictures, scanned documents with explantions, unit histories, etc. Wish I had this book a few years ago. What took me months to figure out, this book had it all."
5,A Great Resource,"This book is a fabulous resource for those searching for lost relatives, those who died in World War Two or survived but said little about their experiences, and now, having passed away, their survivors want to know more. Highly recommended for those searching for answers - logically laid out, resources aplenty, and an easy writing style."
2,Not enjoyable,"I had to force myself to finish this book. I purchased it from a few good reviews, but I did not enjoy it. It starts out OK, but gets worse."
3,Not bad,"I thought this would be a heavy duty pan like what pizza parlors use, but it wasn't. Has a rolled edge which can trap water and the aluminum is not very thick. Heavy duty edges are solid and the aluminum is thicker. It's not a bad pan and it works, but not what I expected."
3,"When the lights burn out, there is no way to replace them.","Great, till it stops working. Seems a waste to have to throw it away when the lights burn out, I'd happily replace them. But without the lights, it isn't a very cuddly toy."
2,Quite expensive for a night light,"For the price, I hoped for a little more. This product is the equivalent to a cardboard box with holes punched in it, with a penlight inside. For 40 bucks I would like to see the constellations slowly rotate across the ceiling, or a music box feature, or the colors slowly change...anything that I could call a feature! There's really not much to this turtle."
5,Twilight Turtle,I love this nightlight. Bought one for my grandson two years ago and just bought one for a friend. It's a great gift.
4,great response!!!!,I recently purchased this item for friends with a newborn and had it delivered directly to them and they were very happy with the gift. I have heard no complaints.
4,Twilight Turtle,"This little night light is cute and have purchased another one as a gift for our 3 year old niece, who loves it. It is pretty basic but kids 2-3 years old appear to be entranced by the different colors and stars on the wall."
4,Helps Kids to a Calm and Dreamy Slumber,"This is such a perfect gift for my 5 year old son. He loves it. He love everything green, and the option to have 3 choices of light colors is great. You have green, blue and amber to choose from. Includes 3 AAA batteries, now, that you don't hear very often. It has a built-in 45-minute timer in case you forget to turn it off.It comes with a cute tiny story book about the little turtle who was able to find his home after a great flood by tracking the constellation of stars. His dad was very proud for this accomplishment who spoke about and taught him about these special group of stars.The turtle is cute, the shell is made of hard plastic with holes of stars and the moon. The light is projected to the ceiling and makes my kids start the bedtime pleasantly calm and ready for a dreamy slumber.I will be buying more for gifts if this goes down under 20$."
5,Great soothing bedtime object,"I just purchased my 3rd turtle. Now all three of my granddaughters will have one (ages 5-1/2 4, and 2). The first one was such a hit, that I continued to purchase more. It is very relaxing for children who sometimes have difficulty going to sleep and comforting for those who are afraid of the dark. Works wonders without having to have a hall light on for them. I would recommend this to anyone with small children. Too bad there wasn't such a product when my children were little!"
5,starry nights,"Bought this for my 3 year old who was saying she was afraid of the dark at bedtime every night. She already had a nice nightlight, but this seemed to be a different way of combating the fear. Love it b/c it is not too bright but makes the ceiling and walls beautiful for her. Every night she chooses the color for the stars and we turn the turtle around so she can find the moon. I didn't even realize that it came with a little constellations guide, so that will be fun when we need to get creative again. Also love the 45-minute timer."
4,no plush turtle,"The lamp turtle is just as advertised, but I didn't receive the plush baby turtle that was supposed to go with the order."
2,Pro-American; Anti-arab,"If you want a book that will describe Saudi culture from the perspective of Saudis themselves, look elsewhere. I was disappointed to find that the author seems to focus primarily on the things he dislikes about Saudi culture. He almost seems to go out of his way to make Saudis look ridiculous.On political issues, the author seems almost like a mouthpiece of the US government, agreeing with official US positions on everything. A ridiculously large portion of the book is devoted to terrorism and re-hashing the 9-11 attacks. I wish more pages would have been devoted to telling me about customs and taboos that would actually be useful for a visitor to Saudi Arabia to know about. It does include some of this, but not enough. The section on the oil industry is pretty good.And no, I am not an Arab or a Muslim."
1,Perfume,"I received this perfume wrapped in some tacky newspaper which I didn't care for. The box the perfume came in looked like it was old, and the product was not like the one I had seen and tried several times in a department store."
1,Water,This cannot be the real thing. The scent doesn't last 5 minutes. What a waste of $50.00. I am so disappointed.
5,gorgeous & great price!!,"boy was i surprised to find this on Amazon. i had just come from shopping at a local dept store & their price for the eau de toilette was double what i found here on Amazon for the parfum! i bought it right away & am really pleased to have it. i love the smell - a bit old fashioned floral, but just beautiful! nice to know there are less expensive options for buying perfume - it never goes on sale in the dept stores!"
5,Vera Wang Eau De Parfum Spray,This is my daughters most favorite parfum. I give this to her every holiday and she loves it.This makes a wonderful gift.
5,Great price for a great perfume!,"The price of this perfume is half of what I would pay for a 3.4 ounce bottle at Sephora, and with shipping it's still cheaper than the 1 ounce bottle at department stores.The perfume itself is amazing with a light,floral scent. I really dislike the harsh fruity/zesty scents. I used to use Michael Kors perfume for several years but decided to try something new. This is even better than the Michael Kors scent I used for so long! It's perfect for a subtle, fresh, romantic, warm scent that stays with you the entire day. This is definitely a great perfume if you're a fan of light floral scents!"
5,Excellent starter for first time users,"This is an excellent, concise, self paced beginners tutorial on Filemaker 8. It gets you started immediately in the development of a database (investment minder) covering the main features of the program. It is not a detailed tutorial covering all the aspects of Filemaker 8. Still you will come away with a good enough understanding of the program's basics to create a database of your own design. My only real criticism of the book is that I would have liked to have had more illustrations showing what instructions should actually look like once entered on the computer screen. This is especially the case in the section dealing with scripts. However this is a minor issue in an otherwise excellent book. I would highly recommend the book to anyone wanting to learn the basics of Filemaker 8."
3,Filemaker Pro 8 Visual QuickProject Guide,"Get a regular FilePro 8 book. This is cumbersome, and expensive for what it does for you."
4,A Good Pick for Toddlers and Preschoolers,"Feast For 10 is a warm, rhythmic story about a family taking a trip to the grocery store and preparing a meal to enjoy together. Each page introduces a number with an action: ""One cart into the grocery store/ Two pumpkins for pie/ Three chickens to fry..."" and so on, counting up to ten twice.The book has much to commend it: on a cultural level, the story features a large family, which is cheerfully cooperative and hardworking without being annoyingly sweet. The children play an important role in the food preparation, and the ritual of sharing a meal together helps underscore their familial unity.On an aesthetic level, this well-written book is illustrated with high-quality collage art, and it easily incorporates the counting exercise without detracting from the story. Because of its rhythm and rhyme, it will be well received by a preschool and early elementary audience."
5,Husband Loves Them!,Got for my husband as a Christmas present. He hates using a car or truck without these. He was very happy to receive them. He says they work great and are a good fit. Nice product.
3,diseño moderno,"el diseño es bueno, claro que los materiales me parecen delicados, sin embargo mi hija esta feliz con sus tennis (que de fondo es lo importante)."
5,Skechers Advantage,"This is a terrific shoe. I found it true to size and it provided great support. Working in nursing, eight hours on your feet demands excellent shoes. These get top marks for the job."
5,"Mailer, finish this before you die! Get to work.......","Russia is moving in so many directions. Pick one, Norman, and complete this fine piece of work."
1,What a waste of time and paper,"If a book were ever measured by its weight, than Harlot's ghost would be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, you may want to read the book. Once you open Harlot's Ghost and try to sit down to enjoy it, you realize you are not reading a masterpiece, but instead a long-winded, boring tale about characters that you really could care less about. This book is such a waste of time and paper, it breaks my heart to think about how many trees died to print this..."
5,Harlot'sGhost,"Norman Mailer's novel, ""Harlot's Ghost,"" keeps the reader engrossed in page after page of beautifully written and insightful prose about the development of a CIA operative. Only Mailer could pull this off, with brillant twists and turns of character and plot development, offering an education unto itself."
4,For Die Hard Reggae Fans Only,"Good stuff, but you have to enjoy Reggae immensely to get this CD. Yellowman, one of the more accomplished Reggae stars has his defined nitch. Christmas music is not it at all, but its fun nonetheless. Interesting permutations on old Christmas classics, and a few new ones of his own. Good beats too."
5,Deeply personal and infinitely creative,"From the very first few notes of this CD I knew that Iwas up for a very special treat and I was right.Ardizzone and Pogossian take youon a fascinating journey into the magical musical world of Spain.Their playing is deeply personal and infinitely creative.They make you listen to this CD over and over, and you areguaranteed to discover something new each time.Pogossian's brilliance at drawing the ripest colors offhis violin adds yet another dimension to the wholeexperience. In my opinion, every serious music lover shouldhave this CD. It is like nothing else you have heard before."
4,Marcelo Carnicelli - structural engineer- Sao Paulo- Brasil,A good and explanatory book about deadening and devices to are used besides the purpose about vehiclesLike the title proposes : hand book
3,"Not his funniest, but not all that bad","This is not Weird Al's funniest CD, but for some reason, Istill like it alot. There was a time I listened to at least 70% of itevery day! . I think I like this CD mainly because of the music, not really alot of Weird Al's lyric. ""Eat It"" is not as funny as everyone says, but its got a good beat! I love ""Midnight Star"" both for its music and lyrics, me and my friend always marvel at the line...""they're keeping Hitler's brain alive inside a jar"" As for the other songs they are decent but only a few are worth mentioning. ""That Boy Could Dance"" is amusing with a good beat and the parody ""Theme from Rocky VII"" is a better; I always disliked the original song! ""Nature Trail To Hell"" is really messed up but shamefully funny!(I usually don't laugh at gory details!). All in all this is a good CD, but there is better from Weird Al. Purchase this album after you've heard his newer ones."
2,"Sorry Al, a bad review.","""In 3-D"" isn't really worth the money. If you're into Weird Al, get either ""Running With Scissors"" or ""Bad Hair Day"". If you want comdey, get Ray Stevens."
3,Not very good,"The songs on this cd are mostly the worst songs Weird Al ever made. The only good one is ""Eat It"", with the rest being sub-par at best. This cd has certainly not withstood the test of time."
4,Yankovic Continues to get stronger,"In this album, Al seems more developed than he was in his debut album. His originals continue to strengthen and Al's humor is often at its best in this album. He continues to show his unbelieveable knack for comedy. He has a great gift, and he really knows how to use it. His parodies are still his greatest strength. ""Eat it"" is probably one of the funniest songs I have ever heard. Weird Al continues to show his tremendous talent and great sense of humor, and while this album is not his best, it is still very good."
2,Could've Been Better,"There are only four songs on this that are funny. Eat It, Midnight Star, I Lost on Jeopardy, and Nature Trail to Hell. Other than those, the rest of the songs are just plain boring. I would have to say that out of all Weird Al's albums, this one is probably the worst."
4,Finaly was able to get on CD,"I wore this album out when I had it on cassette in the 80s, glad that I was able to find it on CD. Very happy with the speed at which it was shipped."
2,News Flash: Boring!,"Let me begin by saying that I really wanted to like this book. A story about a television news station and all of the diversified characters working at the station sounded interesting. Unfortunately, however, interesting does NOT always translate into entertaining! The characters are thinly written, the dialogue is at times juvenile, and the plot (if you care to call it that) has NO staying power. The author does succeed in painting a picture of how a television news station operates, but you can get a FREE tour at your local TV station that will save you both time and money."
3,So-so read,This novel was interesting at times but not exactly what I expected. There was so much going on that at times it was hard to follow. The characters never seemed to come together to make this a great read.
3,"It was an ""OK"" read.","It took a while for me to get into the book. I don't believe this is one of her better books. I must admit that this book gave me a little insight on what goes on behind the scenes at a television station. I will continue to purchase her books. I do believe she is a good writer. I've read her previous books as well. I just don't believe that this book is what I would call a ""Page-turner""."
2,wait for the paperback,I also was eagerly looking forward to the next book by Yolanda Joe but I have to say that I was very disappointed it was very hard to follow beacuse of so many many main characters I am still reading the book but only because I spent the money on it but I just didnt care about any of the characters. Take it from someone who spends quite a bit of money on hardback books do not waste your money. wait for the paperback
3,not as good,"i bought this book because i am a big fan of ms. joe's work. however, i found this book to be a difficult read. there were entirely too many ""main characters"" to keep track of. this book can in no way compared to ms. joe's previous novel's, he say, she say, and bebe's by golly wow. i agree with another reader's review and say wait for the paperback. ms. joe, i'm waiting eagerly for your next one."
3,This One Was Just OUT!,"I liked Yoland Joe's previous novels, but this one was so boring I had to force myself thru it. The host of characters was truly unnecessary to the story, their stories unnecessary to the story, and the main character didn't have a story. Yeah, another reviewer said it, wait for the paperback. Peace and love, Breezee"
4,This Just In,"Excellent! Wonderful! I loved TJI. Working in televison in a technical capacity, I was glad to see some of the hidden aspects of television written about. Many times people think TV is all glitz and money. They forget that not all the people working in stations make millions. Ms. Joe even showed great skill and taste in presenting issues without getting preachy. You draw your own conclusions from this sneak peak. I hope to see more of Ms. Joe's work including the new stuff on her web site. I like the variety she shows in writing about different venues. Show off all your skills and introduce us to the many worlds outside our own!"
3,Tastefully Written!,"I admired Yolanda for the style in which this book was written although I was somewhat dissappointed with the contents. I could feel the atomosphere, but something was missing, but I did not stop reading. The book was a easy read but it was as though she was protecting her relationship with CBS. She could have taken this piece to a new level (best drama), but with the business mind that she has, it was tastefully and respectfully done. If you have never worked in the corporate world, then you will not appreciate this novel. You have to read the book in its entirety to appreciate this factual piece of fiction. She covered just about every issue, from rasim to cat fights, but it was presented in the newsroom environment, I enjoyed that part. ALso, there is one part of the book that makes me appreciate Yolanda as a person and it was; ""You never really understand a person until you climb into their skin and walk around in it.""That is deep!Cecelia Jones Circle of Friends Book CLub II"
2,"Disappointed, let-down, definitely not best work. . . .","After anxiously awaiting the release of Yolanda Joe's latest novel, after preordering a copy and having it delivered to my front door, to say the least, I was very disappointed. I was expecting the humor, dialogue and entertainment that I was accustomed to from her previous novels. ""This Just In"" was slightly interesting because of the newsroom tidbits that were provided entailing the day to day activities of a busy, Chicago station. However, I felt that Yolanda wanted to vent and express her frustrations from her previous newsroom experiences. I usually read a good book in two to three days. However, this one took me almost two weeks, I never felt anything for the characters. I didn't care what happened to them. Loyal fans should wait until this one comes out in paperback!"
2,"If it Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It ....","I am a Yolanda Joe fan but, I was disappointed in this book. I met Yolanda when she visited Dallas to promote BeBe's By Golly Wow. This increased my interest in her work. I loved BBGW and He Say, She Say. They were outstanding. I purchased this book simply because it was written by her. After reading this book, I will be more hesitant to buy her next book without investigating it more first. I understand that artists want to expand their horizons and tell different stories but, I think she should have done a 3rd part to the old line of characters. Those books were really what won her fan base. If it ain't broke, why fix it. It's not too late to do that 3rd part to the lives of BeBe and Sandy. Yolanda is very talented. Continue to do your thang girl, but I say to beat the horse until it's dead! :)"
2,"Yo, Joe!","This book started out well and interesting. Behind the scenes of a newsroom. But soon the characters started sounding the same. Issues were mounting with no closure. Back and forth the chapters go. It makes you dizzy. No flowing. For these people to be high caliber professionals, it was like reading a bad script of highschool girls cat fighting. 2.5 Stars on the SmithScale."
2,This just In,I read the book This Just In and was really disappointed in it I have loved all Yolanda Joes other novels and loved them but I just could not read this one. I think you would have to be interested in the story line in order to follow it. Still can't wait for her next one!
2,Journalism/Broadcasting - Racism 101,"This would be a good book for readers/students who are interested in a career in TV broadcasting. The book gave too many definitions of newsroom terminology & the entire book was based off the stories and characters in the newsroom. I was quite disappointed as the book did not give background information about the characters outside of the newsroom or go into detail about their personal lives. This book was not a page-turner despite the chapters having ""Teasers."" I have read Yolanda Joe's other books which I enjoyed and I still have faith that she will get back on track with her next book. Maybe she wrote this book to vent her frustrations or to educate the readers about the challenges of people of color working in the newsroom, which was not entertaining for me a reader."
4,In the Hall of the Dragon King,"If you have ever read Stephen R. Lawhead, you will know that he is a great author with an epic imagination. This shines though in many of his books and ""In the Hall of teh Dragon King"" is no exception. It is a great epic about the coming of a boy that feels an urge yet doesn't know that it was destiny beaconing him forward. I can't wait to get the rest of the sereies though I have only one reason why I gave it a 4 stars and not 5. It went too fast. Though close to 400 pages....I felt that the plot was a bit rushed."
4,Very Disturbing but quite true,"Of all the Burke novels that I have read which would be all of them, this one disturbed me the most. It struck a nerve in me and it scared me because the truth can't be denied. False Allegations is a testimony of how to keep a rape society going. If you are interested in transforming our society than this is the book to read. Burke enters the controversial ground of recovered memories but not for the reasons he thinks he is. He meets Dr. Bruce Perry who is not a fictional person. I have made use of Dr. Perry's research in my career as a teacher of children who have been abused. If you like poetic justice, this book also includes that in such a way that one can't help but cheer. This is not a novel to take lightly."
2,The one disappointment in a great run.,"If you've never read a Burke novel, don't start here.Vachss has used his fictional Burke to advertise the non fictional work of CIVITAS, an admirable effort, but it just did not make for an entertaining read. False Allegations starts out strong, but the last half of the book has Burke standing around talking to people. Yawn. This one was an effort to finish"
2,Not the Vachss book to judge by.,"Sorry, but for a novel by Andrew Vachss about Burke -- this is just not the place to go. If you want the information that is usually provided at the end of most of his books, go ahead and slog thought this one. There is some great descriptions of cerebral functioning tests and what's up with that; but, hey, that was not why I picked up the latest Burke book. O.K.?"
3,Not up to Vachhs' usual standards.,"This book is more like a watered down version of Burke than the real thing. Vachss must be hard up for material, writing books quickly to fill the market rather than create the literary challenge Burke usually provides. The other characters from the previous Burke novels are almost non-existant, eliminating many opporutinites to expand the story. In the future, if Vachss wants to include information about a ""real"" subject (the works of Dr. Perry), he should write an essay for the American Journal of Medicine. Let's get Burke back where he belongs, the mean streets"
5,Hungarian Heritage - Grandma's Cooking,"The recipes in this cookbook take me back to the days of my grandmother's country kitchen, the smells & flavor's of her Hungarian cooking. She came to the USA from Hungary as a young bride. I can remember her dishes were full of flavor and prepared farm fresh. When we would ask for a recipe she would answer with a a few of those and a bit of that. Nothing was written down. This cookbook is a welcomed addition to my collection. The recipes are authentic and taste as I remember them as a young boy spending my summers on the farm."
1,Keep reading,"I admire the respect and curiosity for Hungarian cuisine because it is fantastic. It's a nice try to explore other nations' heritage, but when you write a book about it, make sure that the facts are right. I was born in Hungary, and I've lived there for 20 years, so I know how most of the dishes in this book taste like and what goes in them. Some ingredients are missing from the recipes and the recipes included are just scratching the surface of Hungarian cuisine. Sticking the ""Authentic"" in front of everything won't actually make it authentic! I had fun reading the Hungarian names of dishes. The spelling is way off! All in all my advice would be: if you are looking for a GOOD Hungarian cookbook, look for a Hungarian author..."
5,"Authentic, delicious, concise and easy to follow.","These recipes flood my mind with memories of my childhood. My wife can't cook like my mother, but the book is so easy to follow that her food even tastes like my mothers. Great book."
2,"More Soundtrack Crap, But A Surprise Too","I had this soundtrack on a past Double Features CD which included Kissin Cousins also. I only bought this to get the full effect of the added non-soundtrack tunes on it. The one song that really rang my chimes was ""A House That Has Everything"" which believe it or not, is an actual soundtrack song. There are a bunch of half decent tunes on this CD, both soundtrack and non-soundtrack; there are also a few rather pedestrian songs too like ""Confidence"" and ""Hey, Hey, Hey"" (real garbage). Other than that, this is one CD I think most folks would enjoy if you can only get by the title song ""Clambake""... take about absolute crap!!!!"
4,Japanese Aircraft of the Pacific War,The book came in a timely fashion and it was in near new condition. I am about as satisfied as I could be about the condition of the book and the content of the book.
4,russian edition,"What a surprise when I found it was a russian edition, despite the title in french on the cover. Luckily there were options for language and subtitles. The russian dubbing is awful, you can hear the original speeches behind the dubbing, and they used the same dubber's voice for many characters..."
3,Hugs is great!,"I agree with other reviews that the game recaps are dull, but the philosophies or world according to Hugs is great. I loved his take on why officials need to be reviewed more. I also love his story about chasing some bums who threw a brick at his car. Hugs also gives some great feedback on his recruitment of marginal student-athletes."
3,This book drags on and on.,"It what could of been an interesting book about the sometime volatile coach, Huggins spends too much time discussing season after season, game after game. The early part of the book is better. This is where he discusses how he came to be a coach. I wanted more about the behind the scenes look at coaching rather than a game by game summary"
3,Hmm,"This is certainly an odd one......First of all if you like myself have been trying to track this one down the dvd is a must, the extras alone warrent the purchase as most of the mystery surrounding the film is solved.As for the film, its very nasty but the first 45 mins are quite disjointed and a little slow. The last 30 minutes are something else alltogether with all the gore you can handle. The transfer is poor and very grainy but this does not take from the film, it compliments the locations and the sleazy tone of the film."
5,Good golly!,"What a treat to finally be able to see this movie when for many years I only read about it in horror and exploitation magazines!How is it?A very deranged flick,like a cross between a Charles Manson home movie and an H.G. Lewis gore epic(BLOOD FEAST,etc)with some David Lynch thrown in.This 2 dvd set is awesome,with extras galore giving a clearer understanding of this one-of-a-kind creepfest."
5,Excellent. Bravo to Barrel Entertainment!,"This release of Last House On Dead End Street, is quite possibly the best DVD release in my entire collection.Barrel Entertainment really put a lot of effort into this release, and it shows. This is probably the best print of the film that you're likely to see anywhere, and the extras and booklet are simply amazing.And if you are a rare horror fan, like me, then you'll truely love this release. Why? Because it contains the complete disembowlment scene, (or the surgery scene as it is also known.) It's all here, in all of its gruesome glory.So unless you have some way of finding the 175 minute cut of this film, this DVD is definately something you should pick up. Trust me, its very worth the money."
4,You Bet Your ... This Is For Real,"This is sadly not the 175 min. cut, but still a damn good movie. I just saw it last night and i must say this movie really kick['s] ... the first 15 min. of the movie was very slow and boring, but then it starts.. and when it does.... the rest of the movie is one big bloodbath. the movie is really great and gory, you should make sure that you're not alone the first time you see it :-)"
2,Last House On Dead End Street.,"After All The Hype And Delays I Though This Film Was Total...The Film quality was ""Grainy"" The Film Was your Average Horror Film.Overall It Was A Let Down.The Extras Where Better Than The Film."
2,Save time and read the reviews.,This book did not add a great deal to my understanding of the cult of the saints. I got more out of the reviews than reading the primary source. At least the Kindle version was inexpensive!
4,The sainted and how they got that way,"The Cult of the Saints is a scholarly look into how the saints, who were after all only human, came to occupy such exalted places in the minds of Catholics. The entire Christian world, it must be remembered, was nothing but Catholic for centuries. Peter Browns series of essays shows how, far from being a pagan holdover, the use of saints as mediators between earth and heaven became so popular and so accepted.This is not a book to breeze through; rather, it requires careful, line by line reading. Recommended for readers who have the patience necessary to glean understanding from this scholarly material."
4,The other history of the early church,I've always like Peter Brown's works. This one covers the early history of Christianity that you don't read about in Bible class. Lots of weird practices and almost a general argument on why it's good to have some organization in your religion.
5,Best KoRn DVD Ever...,"This DVD is great all the backstage, behind-the-scenes footage, and just great footage YOU WANT TO SEE ABOUT THE BAND. This DVD is much better than KoRn Live i definitly recommend this way more than KoRn Live.The only thing wrong is the labels you cant find anything you dont know if you are going into a different room or going to watch something. It is very confusing. I cannot find the duece menu but i will keep looking though.Over all this is the greatest KoRn DVD so buty deuce not Live"
2,Menu overload,"The shame of this disc is that you sit there toggling your remote for hours trying to get clips to play. The real pain is that the clips often only run to literally 1 or 2 minutes and then you have to start toggling to find some more. If there's a ""play all"" function then I couldn't find it and it's definitely something that's needed here, with some 50+ sections that you have to find and play one at a time.The menu's are good looking, but they seem to be what the entire disc is all about, rather than the band and their music. Which really is a shame.If I wanted to play a game I'd buy a game, I wouldn't buy a DVD. Sadly, given that it's so much of a pain navigating around this disc and trying to remember where everything is, I doubt I'll be watching it much, which kind of defeats the object of buying it.Someone somewhere thinks they're clever. They're not. I honestly think I'd rather have it on vhs."
4,Navagation Tips,"This dvd is quite hard to navigate. The thing that I've discovered is that if you play it through Window's Media Player on a computer with a DVD player, you can get a complete list of all the chapters, and each segment can be viewed that way. I had the dvd for a year, and upon watching it just last weekend I discovered that I could do that, and I found a lot of new things on it that I hadn't seen before."
4,Really cool! Really funny!,"Great DVD. Shows behind the scene footage of..well, everything! If you are a hardcore fan of KoRn, (or if you just like watching these guys do stupid things such as drink out of the toilot, bite each other, or try to smash a TV with a guitar and end up having to go to the hospital) then you should definetly buy this DVD!!!"
1,"MENUS, MENUS, MENUS!!","If you want to pop a DVD in and watch all the Korn videos and some cool rare stuff.....THIS IS NOT THAT DVD.What you get is a ""puzzle"" dvd that lets you have the ""joy"" of spending (aka wasting) tons of time trying to find the good stuff though countless interactive menus.You can't pop it in and play. That is out of the question.I like Korn...but hate this DVD."
4,awesome,This is an awesome DVD but it's very tricky to figure out! you have to use the remote every five minutes. It has over 2 1/2 hours of footage thou which makes up for this inconcvieniance. Also nothing is labeled so when you click it's like ageuss of whats going to come up. Without the origonal who then now video included on this DVD i think that this woulda suffered a lot because Who then now is so funny and really cool. I would give who then now a 5 and the rest of this video a 3. Thus the rating of 4. This isn't for fair weather fans of KoRn because most of them would just give up on this enigma of a DVD Yet i thought this was one hell of a video and i picked it up at Coconuts for 12.99 so it's a good deal for the money. So true KoRn fans this is a must. Also if you are a kid you dont want to play this around mom and dad for the awesome KoRn style of lots of profanity !!!
3,Not bad,"Extremely confusing to navigate, but great footage once found. This DVD combines KoRn's first VHS Who, Then, Now? with some brand new footage as well. The funniest part is the cover of BBK, and the woodstock footage is great as well. Unless you are a diehard KoRn fan, I would not recommend buying this DVD, unless you haven't seen any of their videos."
2,if it will play! :(,"I have a toshiba DVD player and never could get this to play right, However my brother had a generic brand, and it played it fine! This is the only dvd I owned that did this (and I own a ton, including just about every rock DVD they have put out sofar)When I put it in mine, it had alot of lines in it.Anyway, I went watched it on my brothers DVD player and I thought there was way too much time killing on this and not enough music. Picture was sharp (on his DVD) sound was good, BUT the ""korn:live"" DVD is 10 x better!!!! way more material!"
4,"Good DVD, but hard to navigate","Overall i think this DVD is excellent for its content, but the only problem i found with it is that it can be hard to find your way around it. Unlike other DVD's where you have a menu screen and choose your options from there, this DVD takes you around what appears to be some kind of morgue/asylum, with options to view along the way. The video's themselves are great, providing lots of information and humour. I would say it is worth buying, but i think you would have to watch it twice to make sure you cover everything."
1,NO STARS,"This is the biggest mess I have ever bought. The videos are split screen or doubled...the same image twice throughout the whole video and the ""who then now?"" video. you have to navigate an ENDLESS array of rooms in a morgue and click things to see something... very VERY time consuming. I can't believe that this was even released. I have been a longtime Korn fan but this is really really pushing it. They should recall this DVD. An absolute must NOT buy. Even if your a diehard fan. This is criminal...I can't believe they released it."
3,Totally Rad. But kind of Annoying.,"Ok... The content on this DVD is overwhelming. There is soooo much footage to watch, and the menus are very (hmmm...) interesting.The whole idea of making the menu an interactive insane asylum could have worked out well, but it didn't. The different items scattered across the various rooms of the asylum can be selected, and each item has different footage. The concept is lots of fun until you realize that NOTHING in the asylum is labeled, and you don't know what you're getting when you select an item. You just have to memorize what is what, or blindly choose items and hope for what you want to see.Well, the menus are the only complaint that i have about ""Duece"". This DVD is every KoRn fan's dream. There are tons of music videos, short biographies, the entire ""Who Than Now"" video, random clips of the band, and more. Much Much More.If you love KoRn, you should be able to get over the frustration of the menus and love this DVD."
4,what?,"There's supposed to be a map you can download to help navigate thru the DVD, but the map is non-existent. So you're on your own as far figuring it out. There's a lot of things I still haven't found on the DVD because I'm frustrated & have given up. But some stuff is easy to find & it's entertaining although you can pretty much watch it all for free on Youtube.com. If anyone finds this map, let me know!"
2,A BIG waste of time,"Ok, first the interactive asylum of the DVD is very good and all the clips, video footage, backstage are very interesting. If it was'nt that we cant just let play them i would have give 5 stars. The problem is that you HAVE to navigate all the time to watch small clip here and there. You cant watch this dvd all the time because it way to long the see what you want."
4,almost but not quite,korn is genius in almost everything. i liked the content (except the creepy stuff)and i liked the extras. the only complaint that i had was on some parts you'd had to know either a particular order or password to access that area (in which korn wouldn't release for at least a month after the dvd). other than that i would say i enjoyed enough to watch it at least twice a week.
2,Poor Quality,"This set is only a few months old and the ball is weatherched badly, won't hold air. The pole has broken off at the base twice because it is of such thin material, and is being used by 6-8 year olds. Very flimsy, I would not buy again."
1,Cheap stuff.,This Tetherball set is probably one of the worst sets that I bought for my kid. The post was too flimpsy and wobbles too much. You need a strong solid post to really enjoy the game. Don't buy this.
2,not that great,"This set wasn't very stable. We considered using some cement to help anchor it, but didn't want that kind of a commitment to where we wanted to place it. My small kids enjoyed playing with it, but when older kids or adults played with it, it got pretty wobbly pretty quickly. Better for younger kiddos."
4,"Outdated, simplistic, but useful","A new edition is due by Fall of 2008, and is needed. This remains a VERY useful guide for first-time cruisers; for those with several cruises under their belt [given the amount of food on a cruise ship, this may be a double entendre] this little book is probably of minimal use."
5,A great book for first time cruisers!,"This book is a great help,especially to first time cruisers . Being one of those, it answered all my questions and several I did not even think of! Jim West has written a gem!"
5,"The ""Must Have"" book ~ Cruise 101 and beyond!!","Everyone should read, and re-read, this wonderful little book. By reading before your first cruise you will gain the knowledge you'll need to make all aspects of the cruise the best it can be. Take it with you to answer questions you will certainly have while on your cruise. Each time I open this book I learn something new. A true gold mine of cruise ""how to"" and ""do's and don'ts"". I buy one as a gift for everyone who is embarking on their first cruise."
4,Right from the heart,"I found this cruise ""booklet"" earnestly written straight from the heart of the author. It's refreshing to see passion in one's work being translated into print! Way to go, Jim! (PS. The book is indeed an integral tool to our editorial team at Asian Cruise Passenger Magazine)"
2,Not for experienced cruisers,"I bought this book because it said in the title that it contained secrets from a cruise director. I have been lucky enough to go on 10 cruises so far. So, I thought to myself, ""Secrets? I can't wait to hear secrets."" This book does NOT contain any secrets. It is common sense info and things you may not know if you've never cruised before. Don't waste your money if you are an experienced cruiser."
5,Wonderful book of tips!,"My family is planning a cruise to Alaska this year and I purchased The Essential Little Cruise Book through Amazon.com. What a great surprise to find dozens of really great tips for our Alaska cruise. You might consider telling people this book not only has a lot of general tips, but there is an entire section for Alaska and the Caribbean. Anyway, Jim West, who I understand plans cruises (I was reading previous reviews) sounds to me like the kind of person who ""gets it!"" Had I not already made my cruise plans with my travel agent, I would have at least given him a call to see what kind of price I could get.My personal opinion for anyone planning a cruise, especially your first cruise, GET THIS BOOK. It is worth the little money you will spend for it and I promise, you'll be glad you did."
1,bogus reviews,"Most, if not all, glowing reviews on this book are from one or two sources that *oddly* list the authors 800 number for booking a cruise. Beware."
1,Not worth it!,"A waste of money. It's just a way of getting business for his own agency. He sounds like he's talking to a group of children not adults.Not the type of help I want and I'll find my own agency thanks, not yours."
1,"Many cruise etiquette tips, but nothing about cruise lines","I purchased this book to get general information to help me choose a cruise but it only provided simple, common sense advice written in sound bites. This book is not for someone conducting research for the perfect cruise. There is no information on the different cruise lines, and the different packages offerd by these lines. Destinations are also overlooked. It is very lite reading and I felt not worth the expense for information that should be covered in any book on cruises."
1,Not Particularly Useful,"The gist of this book is: ""Have a good time, no matter what. Avoid bugging the staff, your problem's not that big."" Very little in the way of stuff which could enhance your cruise or keep you out of trouble."
2,"over-hyped, under-delivered","A waste of money and a big disappointment. There were no ""insider"" tips offered. A very general overview of cruising. There is far more good information available from internet cruising blogs. Anyone want to buy a slightly used book?"
1,The Essential little Cruise Book,I am returning this item.Its a small little book with just general information nothing specific or insightfull.
4,Some of the best of its time,"Thirty-nine steps were hyped something fierce circa 1987 (MTV, Rodney from KROQ, blah, blah, blah), and this hard to find album released through the efforts of Joan Jett is an amazing slab of raunchy glam rock and dirge-ballads. Originally from Toronto, the band was jettisoned by 2 major labels before Joan Jett got ahold of the recordings. If you dig it, there's even harder to find DIY vinyl from their days in Toronto . . ."
5,All Day Wedge,"This shoe is completely comfortable for walking ALL day. Yes, I would walk the mall in these. I liked them so much that I ordered them in both colors Black and Brown. If they came in Red or any other color I would of bought them too. I wear a 6.5 went up to size 7. So, if you are between sizes go up to the next size. Amazon's shipping is great. Received them super fast:) Happy."
3,yes but...,"This book is deep into 60s and 70s reggae and precursors that I am glad to find more about, has a few token efforts from the 90s, but simply nothing from the 80s (Charlie Chaplin, Fathead, Nicodemus, Eek-a-mouse, YELLOWMAN!!!!!!) The authors say up front their recommendations are colored by personal preference, but boy their tastes don't seem very reflective of the breadth of reggae out there."
5,A trip into the mind of a man who killed for a living.,"Quite interesting documentary about Richard Kuklinski, who whacked people for the Gambino Crime family and killed anyone who could testify against him & also set up his own ""kill for money"" operation. Although I was sympathetic to his ""wanting to take care of his family"", but truly the guy was sick & should have been given the death penalty.The stories of him doing contract hits are really interesting & it was even funny to know that one of his accomplices (who he later killed) used a ""Mr. Softee"" Ice Cream truck while going out on contract hits.It's a good documentary although a bit shocking.I recommend it."
3,Moderate,"This guy was crazy, he took alot of lives, but there isn't much in the way of detail that pulled me in, I think the they could have given up more and not had to stretch truth, but perhaps there are legal reasons or possible implications as to why it wasn't as revealing as I would have liked."
1,No Review,"I returned this item because it was the wrong DVD and ordered ""The Iceman"" a different DVD."
2,Killer Charisma,"The DVD contains 2 short HBO documentaries with the 'Iceman' hitman for the Gambino family (now behind bars 'for life').I have an interest in Mob/Mafia fiction (film) and non-fiction (book), but was disappointed with these documentaries.The killer is not much of a talker, and the interviewers don't really get much out of him.Yes, he killed people im shocking ways, but this could have been established in 10 minutes.The 'films' contain a handful of photographs of real crime scenes, and some poor reconstructions.It was interesting to see a killer talk about his job, and also interesting tha one of the first things he said is that he was beaten by his father (so are we meant, therefore, to now think that it's not his fault that he turned out as he did?!).This is a DVD to rent and not buy, unless you get it cheap and second hand. Mine will be advertised very soon."
5,Price/Performance Bargain!,"4GB can really make a difference and I am now a believer.I recently got a newApple iMac Desktop with 24"" Display MA878LL/A (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo)and ugraded from 1GB to 4GB. (2 of these memory chips - works for the 20"" display iMac too)All iMac Core 2 Duo systems have two user accessible slots and may be updated with one memory module at a time. For the maximum performance benefit possible, two modules of the same size can be installed to enable 128MBit memory addressing. This makes the best use of the new duo Intel chips and really speeds things up, esp. when using more than one application. I see a difference esp. when using memory intesive programs like Photoshop or Bryce, and my system is more stable as well.It is a bit early to comment on longevity, but so far, so good!"
3,Four year old iMac gets a pacemaker,"I had this in my iMac within five minutes of the product arriving, and like everything I've purchased from Crucial, it worked without any problems. I saw an immediate increase in speed.The reason I gave this three stars instead of five is that it came with no directions. Having installed RAM upgrades before on a Mac before -- which is both simpler and trickier than on a PC, I didn't have a problem, but this should at least come with a simple one page diagram."
4,Weird Al gets no better than this!,"Yankovic's best, hands down. Though a comparatively early work of Weird Al, _Dare to be Stupid_ is right on target with its impish wit and nasal parody. Such classics as `Like a Surgeon' and the title song will persist in the Weird Al canon along with the best songs from _Even Worse_ and _Running with Scissors_."
5,endless hits,If you like good music you've come to the right place. It's filled with great hits. There's only one bad song
3,"If you want to hear some good parodies, get this album!","""Dare to be Stupid"" has some very clever parodies of popular songs like:""Like a Virgin"", and ""I Want a New Drug"". But the songs may get old after a while."
4,Dare To Buy This cd?,"Well, that depends if you like mega stupid. Some of the lyrics are so stupid even I can't handle it. And I like stupid.Although, there are some high points. The polkas are always funny. ""Like a Surgeon"" is pretty funny. Dare to be Stupid is really stupid. The best is Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch, which made me laugh pretty hard.I really wouldn't buy this cd unless you can get a good deal. I'd burn it if you can, or just forget it."
4,Great!!!!!,"This CD is great. Even though some of the songs are kinda or just plain dumb, you can still listen to all but about 2 tracks. The stupid tracks are Cable TV and Slim Creatures from outer Space."
5,5 stars for the five songs i've heard,I only have heard five songs here we goLike A Surgeon had me laughing hard.Dare To Be Stupid is very peculiar.Yoda is good and catchy.One More Minute is a good slow song.This Is The Life is a 50's song.
5,Definately an Improvement Over 'In 3-D',"I bought this album and his other one, In 3-D, on the same day and this one reallycheered me up after the boring 'In 3-D.' This is one of Weird Al's best albums, with such great songs like Yoda, Like a Surgeon, and I Want a New Duck. Those are the top three on this album my opinion, but don't worry, almost all the other songs on this CD are great and funny to."
5,Are you stupid?,"Dare to Be Stupid is thirty-seven minutes and four seconds and was released on June 18, 1985. Dare to Be Stupid reached #50 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Albums chart and has since gone Platinum. Only one of the songs manages to chart. This was Weird Al third studio album. The music on the cassette is very funny. Two of the songs were feature in movie; This Is The Life from Johnny Dangerously and Dare To Be Stupid from The Transformers: The Movie. I like listening to Weird Al. I am giving Dare to Be Stupid an AAA+++.Side 1Like a Surgeon#47 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesDare To Be StupidI Want A New DuckOne More MinuteYodaSide 2George of the JungleSlime Creatures from Outer SpaceGirls Just Want to have LunchThis Is The LifeCable TVHooked on Polkas"
5,He will always make me laugh,"They always seem to get funnier, and they do. But, even though this one is unbelievably hysterical, this one I don't listen to a lot. It just seems more of the songs then usual are just plain stupid (in a funny way). This album is definitely a buyer, but it's also not as funny."
4,clever dicky,"Dare to be Stupid was the third Al-bum I ever bought and I think it's fantastic. Granted I don't listen to it as much as Greatest hits Volume II it's still really clever. I listened to this a little while ago and it really rekindled my love for it. I did a lip synch at my intermediate school last year to ""Girls just want to have Lunch"" and they loved it. Afterwards one kid came up to me and said ""hey, not as hilarious as the laughing policeman"" (another one I did the year before) ""but it's still pretty funny!"" I think I've proven my point. No matter what age kids are they still appreciate the wonderful world of Al!"
5,Classic work,"This album will appeal more to the Al fans that grew up in the 80s, since the music has much of that flavor. The music and songs is in this album are simpler than most of his later releases. But they are catchy and upbeat. A quick note on ""Cable TV"" - I find it somewhat prophetic, with a parody of all the many channels that would become available. Only thing is, he suggests ""83"" as a ridiculously high number of channels. Seemed like a lot back then!"
3,O.K. need's the rock sound.,"Hilarious!!! Amazing!!! Crazy!!! Those words can describe this CD, but the true word i'd choose is ""AlYouNeedToGetALife"""
2,A little too childish out of all his work,"I gave Al's In 3-d album 4 stars, but I'm giving this one 2 stars because I find this one to be verry stupid. No, really."
5,I love this book!,"I liked Bookseller in Kabul, but this lesser known memoir--set in the same locale at the same time also written by woman--really outshines it because the author, Irris Makler, is so full of life, openness, generosity of spirit and amazing courage. Her joie d'vivre is contagious and she paints her portraits of a strange, dangerous and really alien world in luminous colors and with great style."
5,"Professional, easy to use and fun","I love this camera, I've been using Nikon FM10 for years, it was a great camera, the only problem was with its view finder, it was so dark that I couldn't use it properly in dim light and this made it hard to focus. For a camera with the same quality but a clear view finder, I went for Nikon FM3A. Now am able to have same quality pictures using manual options for more creativity and am able to focus clearly. I recommend this camera for professionals as well as beginners who want to take creative photography depending on manual options."
4,The Encarta Dictionary By Microsoft,"As a collector of modern englsih dictionaries, I found the Encarta to be a refreshing change when it comes to definitions. The definitions don't leave you guessing after you've read them like other dictionaries do. Also, the definitions reflect the ""modern"" senses of a word, for example, ""Aspect"" is defined by using the word ""part"" whereas other dicitionaries dont.I found it to be a good investment. Easy on the eyes as well. Trust me!T"
1,Worst Dictionary EVER,"This is the worst dictionary ever. Seriously. It's only definition of ""delete"" referred to computers. Pardon me, but I think that word predates the PC! We tried to use it for my child's vocabulary lesson but it was woefully inadequate on each word we tried. It does not even give the common definitions of most words. To describe it as ""terse"" would be a compliment. ""Woefully inadequate"" is more to the point. We actually threw it in the trash."
3,mounts slowly on Mac G4 PowerBook running Tiger,"On my Mac G4 powerbook running Tiger OS, this device requires external power and mounts slowly (sometimes 30 sec. or more) and sometimes doesn't mount at all - the firelite needs to be unplugged, powered down and started again several times before mounting."
1,Beware,"The product, while being small, portable, and convenient, poses a few unforseen problems. I've had this for almost a year. Though it worked fine most of the time, it's recently been acting a little strange. I too started to have problems with the image being mounted, and had to plug it in again quite a few times before it was recognized. Each time I've encountered this problem, the amount of times I have to unplug and replug inreases. At the moment, I can't access any of the data on this drive. I'm looking into a solution, but don't know how I'm going to get my 45 gb of music back. Not everyone may have this problem. I, however, have run into quite a few people online who have."
4,Best way to travel,"This is the best way to transport a golf bag on the plane. The coverbag encloses everything, zippers shut and you don't have to worry about snaps coming off and clubs falling out. Everything is protected and you can place your shoes and such in complete comfort."
3,Our tyro assassins are growing up...a bit.,"Well, Jen and Thib continue their pre-graduation assignments with a body guarding job in an environment of ""total"" corruption that reads rather tamely. Aunt Vera and Absalom are working on the same problem from another angle and all four assassins unite to find and eliminate the master drug lord. We see a lot more of Vera's past, although Absalom remains a mystery. Thib is growing in confidence and skills, while Jen learns a lesson the hard way. I would suggest to the author that she had better improve Jen quickly, if she intends to complete the Jen/Thib relationship. Thib is starting to recognize himself and his talents...Jen hasn't got much more than her good looks and her reflexes going for her. Not as good as the last entry in this series but still an interesting read."
4,Great read!,"I think this is my favorite ""Cloak and Dagger"" book so far. The writing style is definitely maturing. The plot is pretty tight, the characters are fun and the relationships are very well done. I enjoyed it and I look forward to future books about Jen and Thib!"
2,Bland and Unoriginal,"Although it's set in a fantasy world, 'Cauldron..' is more romance than fantasy. Everything is secondary to the relationship between the main characters. Don't pick this up if you're looking for fantasy.The dialogue is stilted, the plot is paper thin and the characters are by and large cardboard cutouts (Only Aubrey can be considered a complete character. He agonizes over right and wrong. The other characters are either completely moral or the exact opposite.)In her defense, Ms. Groell has created two intriguing lead characters. Intriguing enough that I'm likely to overlook any technical deficiencies and give another one of her novels a shot.The short biography of Groell mentions that she is an editor, proving once again that it's not how good a writer you are, but who you know."
4,hmm....,"I have really enjoyed reading the other two books in this series. This book fell just a little short of my expectations though. While i found it to be entertaining, it lacked action.However, it was nice to see Thibalt beginning to emerge from his love-sick follower role. Personally, I'm glad to see him start to become his own person, cause frankly Jen is starting to get real b**chy.All in all, pretty good. I look forward to the next one."
2,Horrible Study Guide,"Where do I start? The passages are incredibly convoluted and painful to read. Also, they serve 10 questions per passage (even if it's a short paragraph), so lot of questions aren't anything like what they use in the SAT.Also, some of the sentence completions require basic historical knowledge. The real sentence completions NEVER require you to have any previous knowledge of anything except the definition of the vocabulary.Don't bother at all with this travesty. Get Barron's instead."
3,spider man,"My son likes spiderman , but with this tent it's will not get back to the original if one of the bars broken"
5,Lots of Fun!,"This is a really fun book. It gives you a lot of history, verbatum stories by the ""old folks"" who really believe these superstitions, and lots of good info on pirates, mermaids, superstitions and customs, and the like. I thought it might be a dry tome since it is so big but its not, if you like history and learning about cultural differences. It is not humorous but written in a light style so it doesn't get boring. Plus you can pick it up and open it to whatever subject you want, there is no chronology so you just read what you fancy that day. A pleasant surprise and highly recommended."
3,The Eyes Don't Lie...,"Alice Eastman didn't recognize the sinewy body or raven locks of the unidentified man hit by a car on her Wyoming ranch. But his eyes were unmistakably Dylan Nolan, her childhood sweetheart, her only lover, her husband, who'd disappeared without a trace the day of their wedding - accused of murder....But like the strong, silent type, Dylan neither confirmed nor denied his identity or his innocence. Only his body spoke to hers in the dead of night, professing love, promising protection. For one thing was certain; Someone was out there, stalking Dylan and his bride. And Alice didn't know if she was in more danger from the man who hunted the icy mountains for his prey...or the sinfully sexy husband who ignited her passion."
5,Taken,"This novel is built upon several elements that set it apart from the mundane--a bit of irony, some humor, and believable characters. ""Taken"" is not your run-of-the-mill ""who-done-it"" novel. Rather, it is an engrossing, page-turning thriller that does not insult the readers intelligene. Beyond all of this, it is a fun read!"
1,Beautiful!,"Beautiful! That's one of the few words this author knows. Someone please get her a thesaurus! This is one of the poorest books I've ever read. I bought it because of the great review in ""Entertainment Weekly."" They're usually right on target, but this time I was TAKEN in."
1,Taken In,"I thought George's book looked like a mystery when I bought it. Unfortunately, it is one the most implausible, silly stories I have ever read. Just reading the official blurbs will tell one that. Taken might please an incurable romantic drama buff with delusions of grandeur (e. g. one who wishes to aid innocent children, meet a macho stranger, solve crimes the cops cannot, etc), but I suggest this sort of thing is done better in Steve Martin's Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid. Of course, Martin knew he was being silly. I am not sure why other reviewers have not been as critical. Then again, George is a drama professor in Pittsburg, and many of the reviews (oddly) come from there as well. Hmmm."
1,Waste of money!,"I'll make my review short, sweet, and to the point. This is absolutely the worst book I've ever read. The characters aren't believable, the plot has no substance, and to put it politely is quite boring to read. I'm appalled I actually spent money on this. There is zero suspense involved, considering you can figure out from the the first chapter, the ending. I would highly advise thinking twice before reading this."
2,Didn't Like,This book was almost a pain to read. The characters were hard to relate to and I personally found them unlikable. I think the author dragged on the plot too much. I stopped reading almost at the end because I realized I did not care about these characters that did not seem realistic at all.
2,Boring,"Unfortunately, I have to say this book was boring. It was so hard to read. The plot was so poorly put together, that I had a very hard to finishing it. I'm sad to say I can not recommend this book."
1,1 star is being generous,What a bunch of drivel written by a narcissist that clearly did not use spellcheck.
2,Can not relate,"I read the book from cover to cover in about 2 hours. I'm a 28 year old white male and I doubt the author had someone like me in mind when the book was written. I also found many grammatical errors and misused words throughout the book. It seems like there was a lack of editing. I found the book lacking in sophistication, it was a more rudementary rendition of nightclub ethics than a handbook for healthy relationships. However, the collection of ideas seems to be unique."
2,Strange Place,"The 4 year old that loves dinosaurs liked the mini series, but even he I think thought it a bit strange and only really likes the T-Rex parts. The rest of the story is a bit wierd adn probably explains why I had never heard of it. The quality of the production is fine, but its probably not something I'd spend money on again if I were to do it again"
1,Mix-up,"Somehow my two disc set of the Dinotopia Miniseries ended up as Disc One from the TV series and Disc Two from the actual miniseries. So now I have half of the TV series (which I have no interest in) and half the Miniseries. Did anyone else have this problem? Not the best experience with Amazon. Other than that, I'd recommend the Miniseries but not the TV show. Hopefully you'll get what you actually order."
1,BORING!,"Dinotopia is a great concept, but this movie/miniseries is terrible. It was so boring, I had to force myself to keep watching. Though true to James Gurney's books in visual terms, that was the one saving grace of this version. It was plotless, the acting was bad, the dinosaurs were underused as characters, and the editing often left you wondering what had happened. It was hard to feel sympathy for any of the characters, especially the insular, self-righteous Dinotopians as they try to brainwash the two newcomers to their world. I found myself most in sympathy with Cyrus Crabbe, which is surely not what the makers intended. Whether children would find this more watchable, I just don't know.What did this version of Dinotopia most remind me of? The recent movie of ""Dungeons & Dragons"". Hardly a compliment."
4,Dinosaurs,"I bought this DVD for my boys ages 4 and 7. They absolutely love this movie. Since it is a mini series they never actually get through watching the whole thing but they do like what they end up seeing. The story is, of course, completely unrealistic but what isn't these days? The acting is just OK and the story is a little over my younger ones head but there are dinosaurs...and that's all that really matters.. It is worth it if your kids like anything having to do with prehistoric creatures."
2,Dinotopia (TV Miniseries),"Not worth the money, not the original. This second order, thought it was the original. Did not state Miniseries"
4,wrong disc,"I saw this movie on t.v. and loved it. I ordered the movie as well as the series. First they lost the package. But they were quick to get a replacement. However, when I received the package and went to watch the movie the 1st disc is actually the t.v. series not the movie mini series and the second disc is the correct second half of the movie mini series and it appears to have come from the manufacture that way. It had the security tape and was in the original wrapper too. Has anyone else had this problem? --I received the second one and still the same problem."
3,An ALRIGHT Script and Acting.... by FilmBoy,"A dad and his boys (Carl and David) get planewrecked. They think the dad drowns. Did he?? Carl and David are planewrecked on Dinotopia, a land with dinosaurs and people. They meet a nice girl named Marion, who likes dinosaurs. They both have crushes on her. Carl gets a little baby dinosaur to take care of and David gets a pteronadon flying job. They both don't exactly LIKE their jobs. They see T-Rexes, which were cool. The island's source of power is rocks that give light. Sometimes they'll go black and won't work. So Carl and David go with a professor guy to find more rocks in the World Beneath. Will they find more rocks, and will they survive????My favorite person-character is either the girl or Carl. My favorite dinosaur-character is the T-Rexes or the brachiosaurus buses. I think it's an ALRIGHT script and ALRIGHT acting. Ever After has much better acting and script. See that!"
4,"Great Story, Great Graphics, and Bad Acting","Just like The Snow Queen, this movie has a really super storyline and keeps you interested, if you can grin and bear the acting, or lack there of."
4,One thing I've noticed on the dvd was..,"I recorded the full version, off tv when it first aired. And noticed that the commercials were cutting some of the scenes. Now that I seen what the dvd had. I know what those commercial-cut scenes were. So I would say, the dvd/video is worth it."
3,Great story but WAIT FOR A REISSUE!!,"The storyline is great!! I agree with the other great reviews written about this movie.However, there are serious manufacturing/production mistakes. Right now the best copy I own is the one I recorded from broadcast.I bought the VHS tape to replace my TV-recorded copy. The picture wasn't very good so I exchanged it. It was actually worse on the next tape. I then thought ""Hey, get a DVD."" It was terrific except for a 20-second dead silence when Marion goes to replace the prime sunstone. When I went to return it, the service person checked the new one for me and sure enough it had the same problem. (Another serviceman also had the problem.)So if you get the VHS you get bad tracking and if you get the DVD there's a tiny problem with the sound. I'm waiting for all of them to be recalled!"
3,"Fluffy start, gets great!","This three-part ABC-TV miniseries was based on a popular series of novels about a place where humans and dinosaurs live together in a controlled but somewhat tenuous peace.Part 1 barely kept my interest, mostly because of the overly cute and fluffy tone. Still, I loved the special effects and the mythology, and decided to watch more, thinking it would get better. Parts 2 and 3 not only showed improvement but also surpassed my expectations.I enjoyed all the actors, especially Alice Krige, best know to scifi fans as the Borg Queen (Star Trek: First Contact). I also enjoyed the tension of scenes such as the rock climbing, the skybax rides, and the T-Rex invasion.Now the miniseries is out on DVD (with lots of bonus features), and will soon become a weekly series on ABC-TV (Thursday nights). I'm not sure if the series will keep the freshness, excitement, and wonder that the miniseries eventually captured, but I'll certainly give it a chance."
2,Little too much girl/boy stuff,"It's geared to younger kids, all the fantasy, talking dinosaurs, etc, A great story line... then they have to start injecting boy/girl nonsense. Pretty disappointed in that."
3,Not as good as I remembered from,"I watched it super hyped up because I loved it from childhood. Yeahhh, not that good. Special effects were pretty terrible, which I guess was to be expected. Super cheesy, but it is a good family movie."
4,Dinorific!,"Along with my kids (ranging in age from 5-17), I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The graphics are excellent and the storyline kept us all glued to the television. Violence is at a minimum and there is no swearing or nudity. Clean family enjoyment."
5,Hot stuffing.,This is a hot movie like jurassic park with talking dinos.Its a shame they dont have giganotosaurus.Well 3 people crash land on a contenet dinotopia with a waterfall city as a capital.So they meet a young girl and find proffesor Zippo(Segnosaurus).they discover a sunstone is the key to let dinotopia live.they get separated and Carl goes to a hatchery where he gets a female protoceratops wich he named 26.while David goes to canyon city and learns to fly with high flyers(not pteranodons)I think.a fellow discovers Zippos wonders are correctand tries to help him but he is also a thief.But david and carl reunite and go with the guy while the princess and zippo have to stay on land.the sunstone power in water fall city is failing and canyon citys people besides flyers have all died by pteranodons...
4,Dinotopia DVD,A fun family movie. Probably more suitable for 6yrs and over due to some violence. My young grandson loved it and re-watches it every now and then. I enjoyed it as well. Recommend it to all ages who like fantasy and dinosaurs.
2,poor quality VHS tape,"I loved the colorful illustrations in the Gurney book, Dinotopia, and was SO disappointed in the quality of the VHS tape. How could they sell something so blurred and grainey? Can anyone tell me if the DVD is clear and sharp? The colors in the film were dull and muted. The story changed for the worst and the acting quite bad."
5,execellant,"this movie was both entertaining for young kids and adults,my family really enjoyed it.It came on television in a two part series meaning two different days,and boy my kids couldnt wait till the next day to see the ending they just loved it as well as me and my husband. ya gotta see it just once!"
2,Medievil meets Jurassic Park! Shakespeare without Swordplay!,"Talk about your FAIRY TALES!DinUtopia would have been a better title, just as the whole plotline needed a lot of work. Even the basic ideas of this Communist Paradise where everyone can run around in such a primitive environment without even knives for defense (WEAPONS ARE EVIL!!) strikes one as even sillier than Mother Goose or the Brothers Grimm, especially when one is supposed to accept THIS fairy tale as near serious work. About the only saving grace for this is the CGI work. This one is definitely going back to eBay!"
4,blockbuster success,I think that this is going to be a good dvd.I saw dinotpia when it came out on tv May 13-15. I think it hads a good imagination and stoy line. I am going to read the books now.I can't wate for the series to come out it comes out this fall. I am going to buy this dvd whene it comes out and I hope that the seres will come out on dvd.
1,Dinotopia,Very disappointed. I bought this movie for my grandchildren to watch an after many attempts to open it after downloading it the movie won't open.
3,"I would have given it 5 stars, but...","This was one of my favorite things as a kid, I could spend days watching over and over. But, nowhere does it say that it is in ""full screen"" and you don't find out until you open the case and read the discs. ""full screen"" doesn't make it better in any way, it just takes almost a third of the movie out of the screen."
3,way too long,"Two half-brothers and their father in a plane, crash in the sea. The brothers survive and enter the world of Dinotopia, a world in which dinosaurs live with humans... David will try to become one of the Dinotopians, while Carl wants to go back to his world.This is quite fun - at times - though I found the CGI was not that great; the acting isn't the best either; and the dinosaurs are... well... entertaining at best.My problem with this tv movie is that it is way too long. Those five hours could easily have been crammed into a regular feature of two hours; there was just too many scenes that weren't needed.Enjoyable for the family. Most kids would love this!"
3,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT AKIDS REVIEW! although a kid!,If I could I would give this movie three and a half stars it is definetly not four star material. It is an ok movie. The dinausours look like cartoons. (Where is spielberg when you need him?) The characters are wooden. Who hired these People? I mean the blond haired kid is absolutely the worst actor Ive ever seen in my entire life! The black haired guy isnt that bad but still not a good actor. It has a great story and a great fantasy on how dinasours and humans are living together in peace. Some good action not a great movie but not terrible either it has some enjoyable parts in it. Definetly not something that I would get on dvd. You can tell that this movie is made for little kids. Im not a little kid. Im twelve years old going into seventh grade and still dont have an email adress thats why I write that stuff up on top of all my reviews!
4,Great for a one night gig or the toy box!,"I purchased this wig for a school production of Annie. The front of it looked like a bit of a mess, and all the teasing in the world couldn't save it - and this was fine for Orphan Annie, but when she went to the Warbuck's mansion she was a bit out of place. Nonetheless, it was a one-night performance and the wig did its job. it now lives in the toy box where it is a favorite play item, so all in all a great purchase."
3,it was ok. Wasn't as expected.,"This product was ok. The picture of the wig was a lot different than what I received. The wig I received was not as full blown out as the picture. We tried everything to make it fuller, but nothing worked. All in all it was ok,"
1,Disappointed,"Proof you get what you pay for. I need a wig for my granddaughter who will be singing a song from the musical Annie in school. What curls there were when it was made came crushed and matted in a plastic bag. I don't know what to do with it. Can't comb it, shake it out, or pick it out. Definitely not like the picture. I didn't expect it to be high quality but it was the only one offered so I took a chance."
5,GREAT for beginners and the not so flexible,"I have tried many different Beginning Yoga Routines. This, thus far, has been the most compatible with my level of expertise. The routine is very much for beginners and each of the subsequent routines build on the beginning sessions to provide a well rounded practice. I recommend it for all beginners."
3,Annoying dialog,"This is a great DVD if your looking for one that will show you how to do the positions, but the dialog is so annoying I have to mute it!"
2,Depends upon how limber you already are,"I figured a ""gentle practice"" DVD would be a good way to get my 65 year old muscles into yoga. Unfortunately, her basic postures - which are all nicely and slowly done - start from the sitting cross-legged position. Since I can't get into that position, the DVD is useless. I may go back to using it after I find some other way to get more limber. If you are young and flexible, this DVD should be fine. Otherwise, I can't recommend it."
2,Too slow,"I didn't need a fast or over exercise yoga video so I thought I'd give this a try, but I agree with what others have written here, this was way too slow for me and actually made me sleepy. I give it two stars because after trying to watch it three different days in hopes that it would improve, it is going in the recycle."
2,Boring,I am not sure how this video got such great reviews. She is VERY dull and very slow. I know it is for beginners (which I am) but I couldn't make it through 10 mins of it.
3,Great IF you can sit cross legged,I bought this DVD based off the reviews that said this was a super gentle yoga practice that helped the majority of people. I believe this DVD would be great for me if I could sit crossed-legged on the floor - unfortunately I cannot even using props. The first 10 minutes of the 30 minute routine are spent crossed-legged (and other alternative positions on the floor do not allow you to perform the arm and neck stretches she does while crossed-legged); I reviewed all of the routines on the DVD and they all start out this way. If you cannot sit crossed-legged then you cannot get through the beginning of the routine and I would not recommend this DVD. After the first 10 minutes the routines seem good but probably not for me.
5,Absolutely Lovely,"I have tried a number of yoga videos that left me a bit cold, but Yoga Gentle Practice earns all those five-star ratings for a good reason. The instruction is excellent. The poses work for all fitness levels. The production values, while simple, are perfect for the content, and the music is just right. The instructor has a wonderful soothing voice as she gently guides you through the sequences. By the way, the value for money is outstanding. You get six programs of varying levels. Two are 30 minutes long. Two are 45 minutes or so. And two are an hour. In addition, there is an hour long pose guide that will instruct you on practicing the individual poses. In short, this is my favorite yoga DVD. In fact, it might be my favorite fitness DVD."
5,Excellent yoga video!,"This is an excellent yoga video. The instructor gives very clear instructions and moves at a pace that is easy to follow. I also appreciate the simple, basic, down-to-earth format and style that allows me to focus on just learning these basic yoga poses. There is a separate section on the dvd that provides more detailed instructions for each pose which is helpful. I wanted to do yoga to help alleviate my upper back/neck/shoulder pain, and this dvd provides a lot of gentle stretches that have helped. There are 6 routines organized into 2 different series. They build off each other but also provide a nice variety so I don't get bored. I'm really glad I found this dvd and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to develop a gentle yoga practice."
2,Disappointing product,"I've actually owned two of these. I wanted to upgrade from the RS200, and initially was very satisfied. However, about a month after purchasing this, the watch face became very scratched for no particular reason. Then the watch just died (after only 3 months) - no new battery would help. The watch eventually was replaced after a month of arguing with Polar. I've now had my second watch for over a year. It is working fine, but the watch face has become so scratched that it is very difficult to read when you are working out. I know that the scratched face is undoubtedly because of me, but the design of this watch is clearly different from that of the RS200, which never had the same problem."
1,Avoid,"I got this watch in April. In May, it began to have troubles-- switched screen even when buttons were locked, zoomed in on screens and the manual gave no clue how to fix, deleted profiles. I contacted Polar twice-- no answer. In June, it stopped working altogether. I gave it to my healthclub who gave it to a Polar rep, who held on to it for 2 months, and then gave it back saying that I needed to mail to Polar directly. So, I've had the watch less than five months, it's worked less than one month, and Polar has been disappointing. Garmin, Timex and others have similar features and can't be worse in taking care of you after sale."
1,Polar Junk,I have had 3 Polar watches and bought another as a present. Although the RS200 and this RS400 record data they are cheaply made and the buttons don't work first without pressing numerous time. Very disappointing - Do not recommend.
4,Love This!!,I have been using this HRM for 5 months and I love it! I figured out how to use it in just a few minutes. The hardest part is uploading the date with the infrared usb device. It has to be lined up perfectly (hence the 4 stars and not 5)in order to download the info on the computer. The watch is easy to use and the band is also picked up by my treadmill.
4,Really Beneficial for my cardio workouts,"I have owned my Polar RS400 for four years. The watch does a lot. So, configuring it was a little involved, but once you know how to set things up, it becomes fairly straight forward. It is menu driven. I like having the local software on my computer. The irDA, as others have noted, did take a bit figuring out. You literally need to align the watch very close to the irDA for the transferring of information from my watch. The wrist band is a rubber like material. The one problem I had was after a year and a half, the wrist band tore. I talked with the trainers at the gym and they noted that there had been some issues early on with the wrist band. Fortunately, they had a spare one as I had difficulty trying to find replacement band. I also wore out my Wear link chest strap. So, it has been well used and recently bought a new one. The watch synch's nicely with the cardio machines at the gym and helps me keep focus on zone training."
4,RS400,Great buy... use it daily. had to buy a usb infra-red since product doesnt work with the bluetooth connectivity available in laptop.
1,Poor design,"I bought the heart rate monitor for some of the additional features. It works, but the menu to operate the heart rate monitor seems to require a lot of button pushing. The menu for the watch could have been done a lot better. It is annoying, but functional. Then the wrist band broke. It is a custom wrist band and you need to send it in to have it replaced. Personally, I would rather support companies that have better design practices."
1,Short battery life,"I've had the RS 400 Polar HRM for about a year and I have to say it's been a love hate relationship. I loved the watch when I first bought it but now, after dealing with a defective watch that eats batteries every 3-4 weeks, a Polar representative that was rude on the phone and the inconvenience of shipping my watch a second time, I wish I would have bought a GARMIN. Despite only using the chest strap transmitter or foot pod only 10 hours a week I continue to change batteries every 3-4 weeks. When I first encountered the battery life problem I was instructed to change the battery MYSELF by one Polar representative and NEVER change the battery myself by a second Polar representative. I have used different battery brands and distributors. I have cleaned the terminals of the transmitter and chest strap WITH MILD SOAP frequently as instructed. I have followed every instruction given to me by Lifetime Fitness and Polar. My advice.... steer clear of Polar watches."
4,So far so good,"Bought this for my wife, who's training for an upcoming road race. At first it seemed hard for her to adjust the max pulse rate alarm correctly, but she quickly got the hang of it and now loves all the features. It helps us run together and stay under control in terms of exertion levels."
3,Excellent watch,"Excellent watch, the main problem is that when running in the gym with the Life Fitness machines, the heart rate lectures vary drastically."
1,Polar WebLink is useless,I have been using a RS200 for a few months. The unit works fine capturing the data but the hassle that one needs to go through to get the data uploaded to the Polar site via Weblink is very very cumbersome. It is a hit and a miss and I have given up on transmitting my data because of this useless feature.
4,Spastic Guitar Pop From Glasgow,"Imagine if Bjork was asked to join Sleater-Kinney as the new lead vocalist. Oh, and imagine that Bjork contracted Tourette's immediately after joining. That's the best way I can explain Life Without Buildings. This record apparently came out early last year, but I only recently saw it at one of my local record stores, so it must have just come out in the U.S. I just happened to see it in a listening booth, skimmed through it, and bought it on the spot. Much like the Strokes' record, it's just an exciting record, pure energy. It's all quick-strum, jangly guitars and manic vocals from the lead singer(her name is Sue) who sings the lyrics sort of like the guy in ""Shine"" talked - words are repeated over and over again, Lou Reed-ish talk-singing is employed, stuttering, you get the picture. Rather than being annoying, it's actually quite electrifying. I would highly recommend this record to anyone seeking a much-needed jolt of rock and roll adrenaline."
1,Should have been so much better,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. When a story is as reliant on plot holes and the stupidity of the characters as this one is, you know you're in trouble.This story should have been epic. Instead, it was perfunctory and rushed. There was no real sense of the crisis the reappearance of the Borg caused; everything was focused narrowly on the Enterprise, with no recognition that anything else counted. The direction was very flat, and the writing so bad as to be laughable in places. The special effects, make-up, and art design needed to be a lot better, too.Worst of all, there was no emotional depth to this episode. Moments that should have been shocking, or moving, or chilling, just weren't. Nor was there any sense of how very much all this should have mattered to Data.""Descent Part I"" needed a comprehensive re-write, a better director, and about twenty more minutes to really highlight what mattered. It was throughly flat, when it needed to be the exact opposite."
4,Brilliant!,"Carl Sagan was, if this book is any example, an extremely intelligent and caring man. His voice intertwines the stories of history, philosophy, and science, and every sentence is both brilliant and fascinating. But the best thing about Cosmos is that it makes ME feel really smart. I can follow everything Sagan says, even though it's some pretty deep stuff, because he's so good at telling it on the level of the intelligent, interested layman. The last few chapters of the book may seem dated, but they really aren't; the ""enemy"" has changed but the issues are still the same. I heartily recommend this book for anyone who is the least bit interested in science. It is wonderful!"
5,COMOS,"COSMOS IS SIMPLY THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ . IT IS CLEAR AND THOUGHT PROVOKING , I HAVE READ IT THROUGH TWICE AND READ BITS AND PIECES FROM TIME TO TIME . IF YOU LOVE SCIENCE I GUARENTEE YOU LOVE THIS BOOK"
3,its alright so far,I havent finished reading it yet but im pleased so far so i will have to update at a later time
4,Stands the Test of Time,I read this book in 1989 after watching a public TV rerun of the Cosmos series. The original book I bought fell apart at the binding after a few years for some reason. Re-reading books sometimes is a wrong move on my part as the 1st memory is often better then after the 2nd look. Not in this case. The book offers as much food for thought as it did over 2 decades ago.
5,one of the best on the subject,"Reading Carl Sagan's book is just pleasure, I wish my textbooks were like this! Once you start reading the book, its difficult to keep it down.The book talks about variety of topics about cosmos and it's cousins. The scope of the book is just too vast making the book a must read. The book starts with some of the very basic concepts and stretches to the deep corners of the universe.As always, his language is simple makes even complex subjects easily understandable.""Biology is more like history than physics. You have to know the past to understand the present."""
2,Carl Sagan Writes This More Like An Essay,"Carl Sagan, I believe wrote this book more out to be an essay of what he believes. That sometimes can be a little over-the-top. Usually a long essay will not put out the message fully. The ending of this book didn't truly fulfill what I wanted to read. The book does have some good points about the cosmos but it perhaps put too much emphasis where the book should not have went by doing too much info on the scientists of the cosmo. The truth is, this science book didn't fulfill what I expected of it. And thats all I have to say about this book."
1,Cosmos by Carl Sagan,This is a very elementary work with phoney designs and pictures that are unrealistic. No one should waste his time on such books.
5,Yay!,"I decided that for every negative review I write about a book I didn't like, I'd also write a positive review for a book I did like. So this is a positive review. This book stood out as one of the best books I'd read in the past five to ten years, if not longer. If you want to know how the Universe works, read this book now.This is the type of book that youngsters read in middle school that inspires them to become scientists. So if you want your kid to become a scientist, get him/her this book."
5,The foundation for a future in science!,"This is the first book that I've ever read by Carl, and I'd have to say that I'm hooked! I have already purchased many other books written by him such as Contact, Cosmic Connection, Pale Blue Dot, and Billions and Billions. As I was reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I actually looked forward to reading a science book! He does a marvelous job of explaining the history of the cosmos to the general public-- you don't have to be a Harvard graduate to be able to understand it. His mild amusement throughout the book keeps you hooked, and the charm he has even more so. I'd give this book a BILLION stars! I reccomend it to anyone that would like to learn more about the history of the cosmos, and its future."
5,The BIG Picture,"For me, Sagan brought EVERYTHING together in an incredible and inspirational vision in Cosmos. I think he was the ultimate bigger picture person. If I had not read this book I think I would be forever lost in the details. While I find the parts to be interesting, the WHOLE is where I find MEANING. I have found a reality based understanding of my existance and it is profound."
5,Great!,I love Carl Sagan and I like the Cosmos series. This book is awesome because it comes with a lot of pictures and information. Loved it!
3,Good episodes,"It's very interesting and informative. You can learn a lot about the cosmos. Sagan is, however, somewhat dogmatic about what some others believe in and not him, e.g. astrology and extraterrestrial visits.I liked this series on television. It showed 3 times. However, the last 2 repeats included updates at the end of a few episodes, like the ones about Venus and Mars. This book excludes those updates. (It's probably the same with other editions. The video/DVD sets include them.)"
2,Flawed history,"I can't speak to the science but his history is very flawed.Case in point, p280 ""lost opportunity for the human species"". No human progress for a thousand years really Carl??? So from the year 500 to 1500 everyone just sat on their hands huh?"
2,Fonts of the book are way too small for me!,I am sure the content is great but the font used is so small that I will have a hard time reading the pages
5,"Amazing, couldn't put it down.","The pictures Carl Sagan paints are unforgettable. The descriptions of Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, the imaginative portrayals of extra-terrestial life, and the vast wealth of knowledge (explained at a level for the lamen) is just the icing on the cake. His insightful statements about the way our own world is progressing is serious cause for reflection. I was so inspired by this book that I actually wrote a review for it (I have never written one before). I would highly recommend this to anyone of my friends. It's as much of a book about astronomy and science in general as it is a anylasis of our global social, religious, and political culture."
5,This began my career in Science,"I am honored to say I began my career as a physicist when, as a young child, I watched with utter awe the television series ""Cosmos"". With that series Carl Sagan opened my mind to what can be knowable, given the right tools - and I have not looked back since. He has been called a great communicator and not a great scientist. This I question - because he was more popular than other scientists, that makes him inferior? Regardless of his credentials as a scientist, he undoubtedly began many other scientific careers in addition to my own. Certainly one of these ""academic progeny"" will change the world for the better, and for this we all must salute him. Cosmos the series, and Cosmos the book, are brilliant for expanding our minds to both what is knowable, and making the knowable knowledge."
3,Nice Science but Dated,As I said nice science explained in laymen's terms but due to the 80's issue time frame it is somewhat dated. Still a very nice read for someone interested in the universe around us.
5,Previous reviewer missed the point entirely,"This book is not about the scientific accuracy of Sagan's predictions and musings. If Sagan wanted to be purely scientific, this book wouldn't have been written. The fact is that we don't KNOW enough about what's out there to make scientific predictions. What we do have is our imagination, and our knowledge of how the universe works. Sagan does an excellent job of using his imagination to come up with different possibilities for us to ponder. He speculates about which might be more likely, but he doesn't claim scientific accuracy. This book will expand your mind and give you a mature outlook on the world and our place in the universe."
5,"watched the dvds of cosmos, just finished reading this. great stuff","i love cosmos both the dvd and the book, it is truly some mindblowing stuff, great for the thinking mind. being a graduate history major, i wish i could find more stuff like this. I tried Brian Cox wonders of the universe episodes who studied carl sagan... but i dunno he is just not as good as carl sagan was. but still good."
5,"CARL SAGAN, ONE OF THESE PERSONS WHO NEVER SHOULD DIE.",Carl Sagan is the answer for the people who is able of watching farer. He always tried to explain the knowledge with simple words. Sagan became the knowledge a funny play. Really he was a wise person!!!. I'm sure Sagan will be always remembered in the future like one of the men that opened the path for the route of the man to the stairs.
5,"Everything that ever was, is, or will be in less than 300pgs","After reading Cosmos you'll feel like a new ""informed"" man. By far the best book on the subject. Everything is explained in such a way that even the layman can understand. Ever wounderd about black holes, relitvity or extraterrestrials, then this the book for you."
5,A jargon-free book that invokes the imaginaton,"The best science book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Sagan describes the Cosmos in such a wonderful way I actually regret never having pursued astronomy at a younger age. Cosmos should be made required reading, if not for the insight it provides about the universe, then for its ability to make one imagine limitless possibilities. From Thales math to Keplers physics to Hubbles astronomy, Sagan is coherent yet entertaining. Cosmos is excellent."
3,Tight Binding,"I bought this book for grandfather for Christmas this year. Carl Sagan is one of his favorite authors. He enjoys the book very much. However, the binding of the book is too tight. It makes reading the pages on the left hard. We both agree that it's better to look at the books in a store rather than ordering them online."
5,Excellent,"With very simple words Carl Sagan introduce you in the magic of our universe, part of the astronomy story, tells you about Mars and our solar system and gives you a complete vision about many topics.If you have ever asked yourself how is it ""up there"" and how we got here, you may find some answers (and ask yourself more questions, too) in this great book."
4,The writer is a genious...,"Because she knew how it all ends, and it will end in Japan at the end of this year (2009). Start from the beginning and know that unlike mangas like 'One Piece' and 'Bleach', this is a tangled web of seemingly vague threads that slowly knit itself into a grand and terrible Epic that I'm biting tooth and nail for.Stupid company in America is bleeding out the volumes at a horrifically slow pace and I doubt we'll see the end till half a year or more after the series ends in Japan!"
4,Enjoyable Read,"I liked this book. It was a decent end to the Sheik's series. I thought the heroine was fleshed out fairly well, not just the caricature the other reviewer felt she was. Yes, there were euphenisms for various body parts during the love scenes. This is fairly standard for romance novels, and the heroine was definitely not a coy miss. It's funny how two people can read the same book and each feel very differently about it. (I agree that Mahil was presented differently in the first two books of the series. Ms. Mallery clearly didn't have her books fully planned out.) Mahil was a most giving lover and husband."
4,like the author,i really like this author she has a way with words that will always want you to read more i have all her books read them more then once and that is the thing you want
2,From Back Cover,"LIANA AND THE KING.Single mom Liana Archer had read her share of romance novels featuring dashing, passionate sheiks. Still, she was astonished when sinfully handsome Malik Khan, Crown Prince of exotic El Bahar, hijacked her and her little girl off an airliner and into his lavish palace. Why would the sexy desert prince want a passably pretty schoolteacher from San Bernadino? Dazed, breathless and mesmerized with desire, Liana quickly became Malik's royal bride. But dare she entrust her daughter--or her heart--to a man who would give them anything but his love? Or might a caring American mother and child finally move this proud, imperious monarch and make his kingdom complete?Third in the Desert Rogues series"
5,Terriffic glimpse into Native Culture,This book is a rare glimpse into the culture of northern peoples. A real treasure. If you are intersted in Inuit culture this is a MUST HAVE.
2,Rather disappointed.,"I was so looking forward to this book since I had loved the first trilogy so much I ended up rebuying the first two books in hardcover. I've been turning over in my mind just why I won't even keep this one. Dart-Thornton's sometimes annoying quirkiness (e.g. long lists of things, words you need the OED for) is not here as much in this volume but the BIG STORY is unsatisfying. Maybe it works best as a lead in to the next book. Much time and detail was spent on some days or weeks of the hero's life and then years were just glossed over. That jarred with me a bit. Sections of the book were terrific, lovely little stories all by themselves, but it didn't all tie in very well for me. The reader is taken down one road for an adventure and then poof! the story changes into something else."
1,Skip it.,"The other reviewers are dead on. Do yourself a favor and read the Bitterbynde. I was disappointed that such an innovative writer would besmirch her career with such a shoddy, formulaic bit of drivel."
2,"Beautiful prose, leisurly tale","""The Iron Tree"" is the story of a young man, J--, who sets out to seek his fortune. J-- has grown to adulthood in a desert village, with fairly primative technology. After visiting a nearby fair with few other young men from his village , J-- decides to see the world, and discover what else life has to offer.The setting of this novel is approximately mideval. J-- has a magical talisman that protects him from harm, but otherwise magic plays a rather subdued role. The point-of-view changes occasionally.""The Iron Tree"" moves at a leisurly pace and encompasses many years. The prose is beautifully crafted, and provides wonderful descriptions of culture and scenery. Readers who enjoy Frank Herbert's writings (e.g., Dune) will likely enjoy this novel. For myself, I found the pace too slow and soon became quite borred.If you enjoy this pace and appreciate a highly visual book, then I warmly recommend ""The Iron Tree."""
1,'A' level english submission,"Previously to this book I'd only read Tolkien and CS Lewis fantasy, as well as Potter, so after reading the blurb on the back was quite intrigued and bought the book.I wish I hadn't, it was a waste of time to read. The reviewers that gave it a low star rating are all correct, and yes the prose is drudgy and repetitive, very much like an 'A' level student creative writing piece, or even maybe that's too harsh on 'A' level students.There are so many better fantasy books out there, please don't waste your time. Try Robin Hobb if you want to read a female fantasy writer...."
2,Why?,"I must say that after reading the Byyterbynd trilogy, I was reluctant to pick up another or CCT's books, after it started so well, only to finish in a horrendous rush, which ruined the story. And apparently my reluctance was justified.After reading this novel, it is no where near her previous standard. Lots of description proved that she could use a thesaurus, but after the first few chapters, the same phrases begin appearing again and again. Barely a touch of realisim that even the fantasy genere requires was present, the entire book a string of endless cliques.I can only hope that CCT listens to her proofers before releasing the next book, and if not, that the editors have the backbone to reject it until there is some form of story line."
2,Deeply disappointed,"Having enjoyed the Bitterbynde trilogy - ornate and flowery though the language was, the trilogy had a fresh take on an old story - I quickly rushed out and bought the Iron Tree in hardcover.And quickly regretted it. The plot is unconvincing and the incredibly capable wise young protagonist is challenged by little that life throws at him. He lacks the 'flaw' a good character has to have to engage the reader's interest; heck he even has a charm that prevents all harm from touching him. No room for a character to evolve here! Ultimately, after having read about three quarters of the book on auto-pilot, I stopped and returned the book to my bookstore.If you are hankering for your fantasy fix, and MUST read this, wait till it comes out in paperback."
2,"Lush description, limited plot","The descriptions of the Four Kingdoms of Tir, the people, the vegetation, the mythological creatures are lush and beautiful. However, the plot and characterizations are very thin. The two main characters, Jarred and Lilith, are not engaging, and the limited conflict that they failed to resolve was not worth an entire book. As I came toward the end of the Iron Tree, it was clear that they were only there to set up a further story in which their daughter would be the main character."
2,Save your money,"This pan arrived packed pretty well, but it had multiple scratches on the surface of the top and bottom. There were some deep scratches as well so it's going back to Amazon. Not impressed. Will go back and purchase the Wear-Ever half size Natural Finish Aluminum sheet pan. It is a lot sturdier and arrived in pristine condition. Unlike this pan it's much better made."
1,On it's way back,"I was excited when this arrived, as it appeared to be the same size and weight of one that I've owned for years and love. Unfortunately, it warped after only one use and is on it's way back.Updated - I didn't manage to actually send this back in time, so decided to go ahead and use it, warp and all. After pulling it out of the dishwasher we realized that where the sides roll back into the bottom of the pan isn't solid, there's actually a gap that allows water to collect.It's going to be have to be hand washed to ensure that dirty water doesn't pool inside.I predict that it's getting thrown out soon. Very disappointing."
2,"All songs have same, strained sound - Not Christafari","This album has little variety. Not much depth of performance. Although the artists once played with Christafari, they do not have the originality of presentation and unique sound. The comparison between Temple Yard and the new Christafari album ""WordSound&Power"" is like night and day."
5,A charming narrative!,"I am an academically trained and practicing medieval historian who has written some ""serious"" stuff on medieval queens, and I was enchanted with this author's approach. It isn't a traditional biography -- it isn't supposed to be...it's part travel journal, part memoir, part tribute to the marginalized women of th European past; part talented amateur engagement with the middle ages.The author's attempts to engage with and appreciate Constance of Sicily are wonderfully narrated, and I think very effective over all. I am giving a copy to each of my female grad students to read over spring break."
3,Hyper Cow!,Very very good track. The extended mix alone is worth the price of the whole single. I highly recommened this for people who love Scooter.
2,bonito diseno mala calidad,"Es un t-shirt muy bonita, pero la medida no es lo que esperas y la calidad es muy mala."
1,Disappointment,"After a couple weeks the mouse starty stopping, skipping around, etc. I do a lot of graphics work and can't even reliably draw a stright line with it. We're taking it back and buying something else."
3,Mouse wheel wears out!,"Love the mouse shape as I have long fingers and this mouse fits my hand nicely.The problem is the mouse wheel keeps wearing out and then won't scroll.Otherwise, this is a great mouse."
4,Microsoft quality computer mouse.,"Very functional computer mouse. Be sure your computer has a CD Rom reader, as that is how the driver software is supplied. Well built, has better application for a sophisticated computer. Seems a bit much for simpleler needs and it requires a driver installation. Not a plug in and use mouse, but it works fine and has features like the scroll wheel and magnification.If you have these types of desires for your ""mouse"" this is a good one.If your needs are more simple and you wish to supplement a lap top or net book, it requires a bit of an effort to hook up. It is very dependable and it's ergonomical. Your needs dictate it's value to you. All said, I again wish to say this is very dependable with nice features although a bit large for portable use."
5,Best mouse,This is the best mouse for a desktop. It is ergonomically designed (comfortable in the hand) and has a very long battery life. Works on almost any surface.
4,A good standard issue ergonomic wireless mouse,"I use this mouse as the ""standard issue"" wireless mouse at my workplace. It has the best balance of ergonomics, price, functionality and low failure rate. This was my personal choice for a wireless mouse for some time until I moved on to the VX Revolution mouse. The average user who just wants to get rid of the cord seems to be very happy with this mouse. Finally, on a Windows machine the software doesn't have to be installed, so it has a small footprint for helpdesk support."
1,Nice feel except for the scroll wheel,"If you are used to being able to accurately scroll a sreen up or down one or two lines, forget about this mouse. Most times, moving the scroll wheel a bit does nothing, until you move it again, then it jumps up or down half a page and overshoots. I tried all settings in the driver to no avail. The pointer/cursor, though, moves very accurately, why not the scroll wheel too? Very annoying behavior that I cannot seem to get used to. Hopefully an updated driver will fix this SOON!I like the heavy feel of the mouse. I use a wired Dell/Logitech at work that is too light and has a cheesy feel, but the scroll wheel is accurate. This one feels nice, but then, I also have big hands. Battery life seems not to be an issue. Been using it since Christmas."
4,A good product. IT ROCKS!!!,"Bought the mouse as a replacement for another Microsoft-brand mouse. The ""back"" button is a nice feature. The mouse has a really natural feel to it. Personally.... it rocks!!!"
3,It is not for left handed mouse users,"I couldn't tell in the picture that it was ergonomically designed for a right handed person when I ordered it. I'm left handed, and it really hurts my hand to use. That feature should have been in the description of the item. If it had, I wouldn't have purchased it.The following is in Amazon's description: ""This mouse features an ergonomic design that fits comfortably in either hand to help you point and click in comfort during extended use.""It clearly was not designed for a left handed person. I hooked it up, and it worked fine. but the overall shape is twisted for a right handed person. My wife is right handed, and she thought it fit her hand just fine.Fellow Lefties, avoid this one."
4,Great wireless mouse,"This is an excellent wireless mouse, the pointer glides smoothly over the page and the reception has always been excellent even in a small dorm room with with alot of possible interference. The reason it gets a 4 star instead of 5 is because the scroll wheel is sometimes too loose but that is just my opinion. Overall this is an excellent choice for a low cost wireless mouse."
4,Very Good,"price, Software, and how it works. The best so far that I have owned.and it has a heavy , kind of solid feel to it. Not like the cheap empty feeling light mouse that comes with you computer."
3,Sticky sides!,"This is my first wireless mouse and it works great. The shape fits right in my hand BUT mine came covered with a sticky, gluey surface on the sides - new, out of the box! My finger and thumb actually stuck to the sides which was very annoying. When I took my fingernail to it, it scraped off lines of goo and it also left black residue on my fingers. I couldn't stand it, so took the product ""Goof Off-The Miracle Remover"" to it and scrubbed it all off,which took awhile and left white streaks on the black plastic, but at least it is now smooth and my fingers don't stick to it! Maybe some people like to stick to their mouse, but I don't! I couldn't find anything on the box or Getting Started manual about this sticky surface or why it is on it. Weird."
4,Great with one little exception,"Had a scroll/tilt wheel mouse that died. Wanted another. This was one of the few that I found. Works great, except the tilt and scroll will not work with all programs. Don't know if there are ways to take care of that or not. Other than that, like it a lot."
2,Logitech is a better choice,Already replaced this mouse. I had difficulty going back and forth from magnification to regular mode mouse. And the navagation wheel moved too freely. Difficult for me to use.
1,AMAZON: Change your Product Details !!!,"""Designed for comfortable left or right hand use"" has no right being on this page. This mouse is CLEARLY for use with a RIGHT HAND !! You don't even have to pick it up...just LOOK at it. Why play head games with your customer? Change the text. Simple as that. Do it. Now."
1,Not compatible with Windows 7,"This mouse is not compatible with Windows 7 operating system and that is not clearly spelled out in the item description. Also, it comes with a device that you plug into a USB port that is almost the same size as the mouse, which is conveniently left out of all but one of the pictures."
2,Button Stops Working After One Year,"Even after changing the battery, the button takes several clicks to register. This is the second Microsoft mouse that's died after a year of use, and I don't spend that much time on the computer. Look elsewhere."
5,Good!,"I own the wired version of those mouse, bought it because often the wires in mice get caught being things on my desk making mousing a pain. Unlike past logitech wireless mouse, this one tracks just as smoothly as my wired version. Came with good batteries. The packaging was NOT hard to get into like most plastic bubble packages."
3,Right-handed only,"This mouse is fine. Works great.The problem is, there are both right-handed and left handed people using our home computer. This mouse is ""ergonomic"" only for right-handed people. For left-handed people, it's as nasty and wierd as any strictly right-handed device.If there were an amidexterous version of this mouse, I'd buy it in a minute."
4,Does what it says,"It's a wireless mouse. What can I say, except that it's wireless and it works and has a nice ergonomic design.I was skeptical b/c of the Microsoft brand b/c Microsoft is a software company and this is hardware.I'm not curious enough to learn all the button, but the right, left and scroll wheel are very helpful."
1,Frustrating delay,"I'm having the same delay problems mentioned in some of the other reviews. When I move the mouse, sometimes there is a slight delay before the pointer moves. Also clicking on something sometimes takes 3 or 4 times before it finally registers with the receiver. I've even tried placing the receiver just a few inches from the mouse, to no avail. If it wasn't for this very frustrating problem, my rating would be a 4 or a 5."
1,Performance is not all good,This is the worst mouse i have ever used in my life. Doesnt even catch a proper signal from even 2 feet away. what the use of having a wireless mouse. The left click is the worst part. The double click doesnt work at all. I guess this mouse needs more optimization even now after it is released. I wouldnt advise anyone to buy this rather go for logitech mouse which gives atleast better performance with double clicks.
2,Wrong Type,The mouse was not the type that I was expecting. I needed a usb wireless mouse. That is not what I got.
4,"The only way to go,","Wireless, Yes!!!! Many great features. It's a little heavy but you get used to it. My only regret is that you can't turn it off to save the batteries. Most of the time when I remember to, I just open the battery door and take one out, it does help."
4,Great Mouse,"Great MouseI expected the wireless mouse to have problems responding with the receiver, but that is not the case at all. I really like the programable buttons. The wheel does not have detents like my old mouse and takes a bit of getting use to. It has a magnifier feature I thought I would not use, but it comes in pretty handy. Also I went to the Microsoft web sight and download a free update of IntelliPoint software which has a feature called Instant Viewer which I really like.I would have no problems purchasing this product again but I have been staying with Microsoft hardware products for quit a few years."
5,"Big ""G"" Wireless Mouse Review",I ordered the Microsoft Wireless Mouse to free up my desktop of inconvenoent wire that restricted my mouse movement. The product works great! I would not ever go back and there have been no peformance issues.
2,The left mouse button problem is real,"The bottom of this mouse doesn't say Wireless Mouse 5000, but is actually labeled Intellimouse Explorer 2.0. Not a big deal, but it will help you find more product reviews that will verify what I'm about to say. For many, including me, the left mouse button stops working. It becomes intermittent so that sometimes you have to click 5 times before it registers. The wireless has a delay that makes the computer feel slow, but it is really the mouse signal taking a long time to travel to the base unit. There is some kind of quality control problem with this particular model. I replaced it with the Microsoft Comfort Mouse 3000 and this one is more reliable and just as nice."
3,Mac compatability.,"This is a smooth operating mouse with a great set of features... If you have a PC. Functionality is very much limited on a Mac, and even the few remaining features are finicky about performing in different applications.This apparently is a known issue, and yet the package makes no mention of these problems and the updated driver on Microsoft's website did not help the problem at all.I really wish there was some mention of the limited Mac functions on the package. It purports to be fully compatable and isn't."
1,Does not work on all apps in Vista,A word to the wise - this mouse will not work properly with Quicken or iTunes. I am replacing this mouse as I have experienced problems with both of these apps. A quick web search will turn up many others with the same complaints. Okay to buy this mouse if it is known to work okay with the apps you use.
5,Microsoft M03-00090 Wireless Optical Mouse 5000,"I have bought this mouse from Amazon before and reviewed it but that review appears in a different location ( probably because that mouse was listed under a different model number but it was the same item )This mouse is a winner ! It fits my hand perfectly, is very responsive and the programmable buttons speed up my work. I bought this one to put on the shelf as a backup, because this design seems to be getting harder to find, and I don't want to be without one. I get about 3 years service out of one of these and I am on my third one ( about 5 or 6 hours use a day during the work week on graphics programs and database manipulation - - - and some use on the week-ends also )I have not had any compatibility issues and installation was easy. If you are right-handed this is a very good mouse."
5,Quality Tool,"This is a great heavy-duty quality tool. It has a good weight in your hand when using it. If you have ingrown toe nails and don't want to go to the podiatrist to get toe surgery, this is the next best thing. It is a unique tool that you will not find in any kit. As a runner I can't say enough good things about this tool."
5,Works perfect!,This stuff works perfect! I would recommend it to a friend. It was a very successful purchase - must try!
1,Pinball Madness 2,"This is for Windows 95. Couldn't get Pinball Addiction to run on my win XP (Pentium 4). Timeshock has ~ 3-5 sec delay with the flippers. Did not bother with the rest. I am giving them away, may be throwing them away if no one else wants them. Just wasted my time and money."
1,Biggest waste of money ever!,Warning: do not even consider buying this piece of garbage. One song on this entire CD is done okay (squealer). The rest are absolutely horrible. Not only that but the song selection was bad right off the bat. The furor? Badlands? Gimme a break. The remake of Back in Black is quite possibly the worst thing I've ever heard. Was this CD a joke? The bands who particpated in this should be boiled alive. HORRIBLE!
1,very displeased with this cd.,I feel this cd should be in the reduced section. It is not ac/dc and these bands need to find a job at mc donalds.they cant hold a candle to the real ac/dc.
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,This is the biggest load of crap I've ever seen. Every single one of these songs is the equivelant of walking to Bon Scott's grave and urinating directly on it. Calling it a tribute is just bringing down one of the greatest bands to ever live further.
5,If highbrow literature were set to kickass music,"This is my favorite Thermals CD. The first time through it may sound like they are just another loud punkish trio, but the lyrics are at a cerebral level not often found in music. The ideas give this CD much more replay ability...good for those of you like me who can have fickle and fleeting music commitments.Hutch's songs have a self awareness that is clever and brilliant.Your body will be happy rocking out and your mind sated with the conundrum of future moments and repetition in a song about keeping time."
2,Freakin ok,2 1/2Thermals briefly blaze through a better constructed set of still-battling-mediocre indie punk.
5,(In French) La magie opère...Like a wind of love & mediation,"Les Nubians nous offrent un fabuleux mélange de sonorités qu'elles imprègnent de leurs délicieuses voix. Par toutes les méditations et réflexions, nous pouvons traverser les frontières des couleurs et des appartenances et les accompagner pour délivrer un message de tolérance, de respect, d'amour et de vérité sur l'histoire des peuples, noir notamment.Elles nous manquent sitt l'album fini...They're amazing, by the way of singing, the subjects of their songs... They find a way to ask for justice... (for black people History and morover for everybody) so beautiful. They speak about love, music, etc. with tenderness & fluidity. I love them. Thank You is the better word."
5,On a scale of 1-10 it's a 100!!!!,"I myself enjoy this duo of beautiful ladies, they are what real music is about. I am glad they are coming to L.A. to do a concert. I will be there with my C.D. in hand and hopefuly meet them. That would be a treat for me. This is my favorite group as far as R/B World Music goes. I am from NY and they used to perform out there a lot and glad I can now see them in L.A."
2,one fantastic song,"I bought this CD on a reccommendation that I would like it because I love MC Solaar. I bought it and listened to it, only to find it had much too much ""soul"" for my taste. The only song that made me consider keeping it is ""Les Portes du Souvenir"" which is an amazing song. However, for 1 song, I'm not willing to listen to an entire disk of stuff I don't really like. For those who like this type of music, I'm sure it's a great album, but I don't think the Amazon suggestion was quite right in this case."
5,tres bon! very good!,tres bon! c'est un cd merveilleux qui a un bruit doux du monde je jazz/african/hip hop/ new a lui.very good! it is a wonderful cd that has a smooth jazz/african/hip hop/new world sound to it.
5,"Tres magnifique, plus des autres!","I'm not a fan of R&B or hip-hop but this album has taken me over. I don't need to say that Les Nubians have integrated something I enjoy to make it mass-marketed appeal. This is just well done music that I can listen to. ""Makeda"", ""Embrasse-Moi"" and ""Sugar Cane"" are only 3 of all 15 great tracks. Tout a fait, il n'y a rien d'egal."
5,Execellent CD,"This is an excellent CD that I first heard two months ago on broadcast.com. By far the best CD I've bought in the last 5 years.Thank you, Les Nubians, for resisting the temptation and industry pressure to make formula music. Now if only more R&B artists could follow suit and avoid offering the cookie cutter, mind numbing hip-hop dribble that is so prevalent today.Much success to the two the artists; I look forward to seeing them on tour in the Baltimore/Washington area.By the way, what about a fan club, or at least a Web site? I want to know what you two are up to nowadays."
4,C'est Magnifique!,"When I first heard this duo on a local radio station a couple of months ago, it was so hooked by their smooth vocals that it was a couple of weeks before I realized that they were not singing in english! However, that makes no difference in this case. These sisters are awsome and I hope they have a long and bright future ahead of them. I personally recommend ""Makeda"" and ""Domain"", but by the cd and decide for yourself. It is wonderful to listen to, well produced and easy to like. There is even a cover of Sade's ""Sweetest Taboo"" called ""Tabou"" and sung in french. I plan on buying extra copies to give as gifts. This cd is definitely worth adding to your smooth jazz collection."
5,LOVE IT!,"Just one more voices of praise for Les Nubians. Beautiful voices, great grooves, such a smooth relaxing sound. The whole album is wonderful. I have been telling everyone about it..."
5,"An Insightful & Refreshingly different CD, A definite Buy !","This CD by Les Nubians offers a blend of everything different to what is out there when refering to Urban music. Don't let the difference in language put you off, just open your mind and you'll soon enjoy the ride this CD gives you again and again. The ethics of the so called 'nu classic soul' are used as a basis for this album that make it become such a listening pleasure. Check out tracks as diverse as the 'Tabou' feat Roots, the drum & bass inspired 'Sourire' and the infectious 'Makeda'. Basically if you want a quick review there's no need to think about, just add this CD to your collection, but if you're narrow minded and unable to get with this album's non-existence of bump 'n' grind jiggyness, this is not for you."
4,A treasure!,"I bought my first copy of this book over twenty five years ago. At that time, there were not many cookbooks that contained recipes using Caribbean fruits and vegetables and using techniques familiar to us. Now, many years later, I have bought my second copy and may even purchase a third to give to my God-children to teach them how and what to cook. Although a classic and harkens back to an earlier era in the Caribbean, it still reminds us of who we are, where we come from and just how good Caribbean cooking is. And the recipes, they all still come out wonderfully! Update January 2011 - Just ordered my 3rd copy of this book!"
1,Seemed Ok...then broke in under 3 weeks,"The unti seemed Ok, although I thought the swivel function was far too stiff. Then the top tab broke off after 3 weeks of use, while I was snapping the phone in. Save your money!"
3,"List Price of $15? Yea, Right!","Just got this, and it seems to fit pretty securely - we'll see. The thing that gets me is the ""List"" price on this (and a lot of other stuff that you see on Amazon). This is about 20 cents worth of plastic. Looks like something that your neighborhood dollar store would have on the shelf. That said, if it works, I'm OK with paying a little over $6 for it. Had to have something for my new E815."
4,No problems so far,I've had this holster for a month now. It's very convenient -easy to use (once I figured out how the razr fit into it) - no problems so far.
2,"Nice design, but they keep breaking","I've bought a few of these. Each time one breaks, I buy another. I've tended to blame myself for being careless. But I've concluded that the plastic is weak and poorly reinforced at the top-of-phone latch. Every one cracks in this area. Next, I'll look for a case-type holder that hold the phone like a wallet, instead of this clip-on style."
2,OK for the price,"Basically, it's a crummy clip. I've read reviews of the Brand name one and they don't seem to be much better. So If i had to I'd go for the cheaper model as they both will break.I dropped mine in the street and the top clip broke just as someone else said. Overall, the design is bad and there are NO good cases or clips for this phone."
1,Gone in 1 week,"Bad holster, don't waste your money on this holster. After 1 week of purchase when i tried to remove my phone from the holster, the top notch got broken, now i spent $20 to buy new one from circuitcity, the verizone brand."
2,Picture book,This book is a collection of exercises and drills you can do to train for football. It's just a bunch of pictures with descriptions. There is no guidance on how to sequence your training. Dissapointed.
1,Dont buy this,"My main beef with this book is that, like everybody has already said, it's just a collection of pictures and description with some ""rah-rah-rah"" pep talk included in between about being a renegade. Although, some routines are laid out like the speed and jump rope exercises, there was no explanation on how to incorporate it in a training plan. There was not even an explanation of basic physiology and training principles.It's probably okay if you already have a basic foundation on training methodology but for a beginner or a novice, it's better if you look somewhere else.Plus, you can actually find in the internet 90% of the stuff in the book in John Davies's past articles."
1,Not what was expected.,"When ordering this book, I thought that it would be a comprehensive guide to football training, with sample schedules, routines, etc. Instead, it's mostly photos of exercises with weights, agility drills, and flexibility drills.I would not recommend this if you are looking for a complete football training guide. It may be good if you want a few different exercises to try, but I find it hard to believe that most football coaches don't know these drills already."
3,A review by an average Joe,"Okay, I'm not a football player, or a football coach. I'm a guy who wanted a book about training. Football players are some of the best conditioned athletes - even if some of them don't look like it. I'm a regular guy who wants to be in good shape. So from that perspective:The Good: There are many exercises to improve your agility, strength, and power. Things that can benefit anyone of any sport or sportless background.The Bad: As someone else said, there is no guidance. In general, there is no mention of amounts of sets, reps, or how often. No recommended routines or schedules. Just an explanation of how to do the exercises and drills.That being said, this book does serve as an ""idea book"" so I can incorporate new things into my workouts. If you are looking for a book with a collection of interesting exercises (though someone may say some of them are not practical) and can deal with the lack of guidance, get this if you are willing to pay the high price. ..."
1,Exercises Not Training,"This book promises a lot, but doesn't deliver. Its simply a compilation of exercises. Most seem reasonable and useful, but it makes this a picture book and not a training book. While exercises for the various aspects of football are provided there are no routines or program recommendations. For example in the strength training section there is no discussion of reps, sets, % max, etc. On static stretching there is no discussion of how long to hold or how many sets to do. The same applies throughout the book except for the skipping rope section. In other words, other then talk about how hard his program is, Coach Davies doesn't provide a clue as to what it is. There are much better references for training. Save your money, there isn't anything here other then pictures."
5,Coach Davies,"We are having great success implementing Coach Davies' ideas into our summer strength and conditioning camps. If your goals are to develop maximal speed, acceleration, power, explosive strength, agility, flexability, body awareness and good, old fashioned mental and physical toughness then this is the book for you.Derek AlfordGarland, Texas"
3,SATANISM MEETS GLAM DISCO SEX AND GROOVE?,"Electric Hellfire Club is a very talented band but its hard to believe that they are really Satanists or if it is all a show.Ive seen them live and they perform with great dramatics/theatrics unlike other ""Satanic death metal""bands.But Im not sure whether it is a mock or a sell out on Satanism. On this CD there are groovy dance tracks with great electro beats that a non-Satanist could enjoy. It is not as dark as their debut ""Burn Baby Burn"" but it is still enjoyable. I dont label them on their religious beliefs but on their talented, fun, erotic, groovy music. Hardcore Satanists may embrace the fact that they could be in a sense ""Satanist missionaries"" or they may be appaulled by the fact that a band is exploiting their beliefs in a non-serious way that seems mocking. All in all, ""Calling Doctor Luv"" is a great album whether you are Satanist or not."
4,an awesome cd,"This is an awesome cd, ehc provides the perfect dark satanic music to accompany there purely satanic lyrics."
4,well- done music by a medium rare group,"this is a truly must have Cd for all satanists, goths, and rave junkies. a fast moving cd, which conjures images, as well as provokes many emotions, also holds sentimental value for me."
1,Open Theism' Roots,"I bought this hoping for some good information. Only the first chapter or so is worth reading. His position that God really does not know everything and that if God cannot learn anything would make His life one of stagnation are seriously flawed. I realize that he is quoting others, but they were not worth the space.This book will not help an extreme Calvinist reexamine his position, it will only drive him further into his system. The seeds of open theism are seen in the appendices. Quite frankly I was shocked when I read the book.I hold to an unlimited atonement so I am not giving this book a bad review because of its position, but on how the case is made. I would not waste my money on this one again."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought this compatible inkjet cartridge for the BJC-6000 printer to save a few bucks over the genuine Canon replacement. Not long after installing the replacement cartridge, my printer stopped working. I was told by a Canon technician that I would need to replace the ink tank altogether. Although the ink tank is a wear and tear item and needs to be replaced every so often, the Nectron knock off inkject cartridge probably hastened the replacement schedule. The Canon technician suggested that the knock off cartridge probably clogged the ink tank. Oh well. I guess the adage applies to ink tank cartridges as well - You get what you pay for."
4,Her Very Own Husband by Lauryn Chandler (Mills & Boon Hardcover),"Review for ISBN 0263170888, the regular print hardcover edition from Harlequin Mills & Boon.Description from the book back cover:Gift-wrapped husband! Rose Honeycutt wasn't wishing for a husband when she blew out her birthday candles. But when a handsome stranger showed showed up on her doorstep she began to believe all her dreams were coming true ... Skye Hanks found Rose incredibly attractive, irresistibly charming and ultimately his perfect woman. But Skye hadn't come to town to find a wife; he'd come to find the son he'd never known. He couldn't let love get in the way, could he?"
3,A CAUTIONARY TALE...,"The book is a mediocre thriller that is purely plot driven, as none of the characters are particularly well-developed, and, for the most part, are not particularly intelligent or all that likeable. The dialogue is nothing to write home about, though the plot itself is somewhat interesting.It is a cautionary tale about the internet that involves a serial killer who preys on lonely love-starved women on a fantasy site on the internet. That being said, it has a somewhat anachronistic feel to it, as it is a bit outdated, as those operating on the internet are giving DOS commands to maneuver around in cyberspace. This is understandable given the fact that the book was published sometime in the mid nineteen nineties.Overall, this is a book from which fans of the author or those who enjoy the thriller genre may derive a modicum of enjoyment. If so, borrow it from the library rather than buy it."
4,Good Way To Pass Time,"I liked the main character, and the book in general. I did not find it to be super scary, but you could definately see how it would apply to real life.I had a hard time understanding all of the people into ""cyber"" sex. I was surprised by the amount of it. I guess I am not that computer literate, I don't even know how to find these sites. It was a pretty different reality. I also had the impression that this book was written several years ago.Had 2 different story lines going on, and what you thought was happening wasn't. It was not quite that predictable.Good way to pass the time. I would recommend buying it used unless you are in love w/the author. If you like this book, you would also like books by Kay Hooper, Helen Myers and Erica Spindler. Also Lisa Jackson and Iris Johanson.Good luck!"
3,Patience Required,"Bethany Campbell's writing style is a lot like that of her character, Brooke Tharpe. You have to keep plowing through endless, boring details before you get to the actual story. I almost gave up reading this book before I got to the good part.The characters in this book are so stupid, I couldn't feel sorry for them. Carrie Blue is supposed to be a former policewoman. Shouldn't she know better than to give information to a stranger on the phone asking where she lives? They ALL should know better than to give personal information to people they meet on the internet! ""Stupidity 101"" would be a more appropriate title for this book."
5,Good book for engaged couples!,"This book is great to help couples discuss important topics before they're married. Each chapter is broken down to a couple pages of reading and then a worksheet to be filled out by each person and then you discuss what your answers were and why you might have disagreed. It takes a lot of time to get through and it's not something just one person in the relationship can do, but if both partners are dedicated to it I think it's a great tool to have access to."
4,Good to discover more things about each other.,"This book might be a little old BUT all the questions posed in it are still the major questions today's couples deal with and talk about. There are 7 major areas: Communication, Attitude, Resolving Conflicts, Religious Orientation, Money matter,s Sexual Relationship, & Family planning/children. Each area has T or F questions for YOUR opinions (Both what your personal one is and what you this His/hers is)! You each do the same questions, apart from each other then come together and compare results, and on areas you are totally different on it helps you to discuss through them. I would recommend this book as a fast questioner book, maybe after you've read a book like ""Things I Wish I knew before we got married by Gary Chapman""."
1,No good for any but religious nuts,"This book is only do for the extreme capitol C self-proclaimed christians. Anybody else, forgets - you don;t count."
5,Greatest Instant Camera,"This camera is great! Not only is it extremely affordable but it takes instant pictures. It's small enough to fit in your pocket and the smaller sized pictures are great for small picture frames. Also you have the option of buying regular i-zone film or sticky i-zone film which the kids just love! The film is also cheaper priced than other polaroid type cameras, and when you consider the cost of developing film its even more reasonibly priced than regular film. I definately recommend it for children, teenagers, or someone looking for an extra, more playful, camera"
5,The Queen's piper is the ultimate piper!,"If you like bagpipes, Jim Motherwell makes them magical! Something every good Scotsman should own! Excellent collection! What more needs to be said?"
1,Not the Product Shown,"The product shown is labeled and described as standardized to two constituents, Hypericin and Hyperforin. The product I received is labeled as standardized to only one, Hypericin. The standardized Hyperforin content was specifically why I chose this product. Although I did receive a prompt refund, I would have been far happier had I just received the item as described in the first place."
2,Not the voice he had during his film career,"I jumped at the chance to get this without investigating much about it. What I found was this was recorded relatively late in Astaire's life when his voice had lost its brightness and youthful beauty. I didn't realize this when I purchased it. The older voice just has no zing for me; the timbre of his voice completely changed. While this set is indeed a pretty comprehensive collection, you may not like what you get if you are looking for the younger Astaire sound. Astaire also makes numerous comments throughout, which I find interesting at first, but intrusive later.In the same vein, I've learned that I don't enjoy the very young Sinatra or Tony Bennett vocals since I didn't grow up hearing them, but love their more mature voices; often I don't even recognize them as the artists in their earlier recordings as a result. Lesson learned: Determine which phase of an artist's career is on the CD before purchasing."
1,Suze needs to go back to the drawing board.,Don't waste your money. All she does is strike poses and wear trendy glasses. A bad source of investment information. The sad thing is there are a lot of good female money managers. Suze is good at marketing Suze.
4,Great tool to put the stratgies to work,"Not only does this complement 9 Steps to Personal Freedom, more importantly, it shows how to utilize the techniques. It's almost like having Suze as your own personal coach."
5,Great Information,I highly recommend this book for getting your money in order and keeping track of where it goes. It teaches you how to develop good tracking habit. A great guide for someone who has little or no experience successfully handling their money.I bought this book because I had no experience and I found it to be a complete guide book.It is easy to use and straight forward. Not at all complicated.
3,Just ordered another but have second thoughts.,"We were thinking that these were helping with our youngests' learning issues, but that help turned out to be the ""Attentive Child"" wafers (some DMAE in the mix) and Fish oil supplements that were responsible for most of the increase in cognitive function, rather than the small amount of DMAE and soy Lecithin in the Pedi-Active. I have ordered another bottle to compare to results of the other 2 in combination, but for the $$, Pedi-Active does not make the grade at a significant cost increase over the other 2."
1,Very Disappointing,"This was the first of two audio purchases that I made from theHynosis Network series. I was very disappointed in the qualityof the recording and the quality of the material.I am a Southerner with a mild accent; however, McNeal's deep southern accent was extremely distracting. I found hertechnique lacking. The cd excludes (IMO) effectivebackground sounds and music.I would not recommend this product as an effective measurefor fine tuning test taking strategies."
3,Short Video,"This video was ok. It did not contain a lot of presentation by Louie Giglio, which was why I bought it. The entire video only runs 24 minutes, which was very disappointing for my total cost of $12.98. The whole concept was ok, it was just very brief."
1,THIS IS CRAP,"To put it mildly, this cd is crap. I am a long time fan of Siouxsie and the Banshees, and I had no idea what I was expecting when I got this cd. The two covers of Night Shift were ridiculous! I like the band Collide, but I have to say that their cover of Obsession really sucked. If you love the Banshees, DO NOT buy this tribute unless you wanna puke all over your cd player."
1,"This album is an absolute ""silly thing""!","While some of the tracks contained on this album are mediocre interpretations of Siouxsie's songs, most are truly terrible. 'Night Shift', possibly the Banshee's eeriest song, is misrepresented twice: Stone 588 tortures it in an absurd mockery, and Swithblade Symphony mess up the lyrics several times..... BAD!"
3,"Just OK, But Not Worthy of Siouxsie!!!!","The cover of Red Over White is SUPERB on this album (dare I say it? better than the original? sacrilege!! well, in true Banshee tradition, The Shroud covers a song and makes it their own!), however, things are a bit downhill from there. Too many of the tracks sound like they are the same band, too synth-heavy and simply not interesting enough. Love them or hate them, the Banshees' music was so multi-faceted you can listen to a song a hundred times a find some new twist to it. Not the case here. I was terribly disappointed by Switchblade Symphony's version of Nighshift! So flat! The vocals are OK, a bit haunting, but otherwise dullsville! I suppose what this points out is that NO ONE can adequately cover the Banshees. They are in a class, a world ALL their own."
3,"Just OK, But Not Worthy of Siouxsie!!","The cover of Red Over White is SUPERB on this album (dare I say it? better than the original? sacrilege!! well, in true Banshee tradition, The Shroud covers a song and makes it their own!), however, things are a bit downhill from there. Too many of the tracks sound like they are the same band, too synth-heavy and simply not interesting enough. Love them or hate them, the Banshees' music was so multi-faceted you can listen to a song a hundred times a find some new twist to it. Not the case here. I was terribly disappointed by Switchblade Symphony's version of Nighshift! So flat! The vocals are OK, a bit haunting, but otherwise dullsville! I suppose what this points out is that NO ONE can adequately cover the Banshees. They are in a class, a world ALL their own."
3,3 stars for the Inkubus Sukkubus cover,"BR>There is one saving grace: Inkubus Sukkubus's portrayal of ""Spellbound,"" which was truly great. However, that one excellent song isn't worth the price of the horrible screeching and cthulhu-growls adorning the rest of the album (I expected much more from Switchblade Symphony)."
5,A 2005 Best Seller!,"A Cry for a Hero will be on the BEST SELLERS list for 2005! Read and believe in this dynamic new author, Jonathan Womack and what he has to say about his very own out-of-body experience and how he so intimately weaves it into a thrilling tale of superhero adventurer vs. terroist.Written before 9/11.... the author's virtual premonition will astound you as to the similarity to our history's real turn of events.Nancy Cullis, Literary Guild - Evaluation Specialist"
2,Cueing hard to follow,I found this video hard to follow. You need to watch her as you're doing the flow because her verbal cues come after the poses - which is pretty much impossible. I tied to follow it a couple times and then gave up.
5,Great workout,"This is a great workout that is definitely geared toward an intermediate to advanced practitioner, at bare minimum a beginner with a high degree of flexibility. Even the beginner flow (39 min long) includes some poses that you may not get the first time you try the DVD. There are 2 other flows that are 70 and 71 minutes respectively. These flows provide a great mix of beginner, intermediate, and advance poses done in a flow that will more than likely make you sweat. The DVD also includes a section with 20 or so poses that gets very detailed about how to enter and hold the poses. Overall the DVD quality is good and the instructor is excellent. I would suggest at least several years of experience before trying this DVD unless you have a gymnastics, a dance background, or a good enough understanding of yoga to otherwise be able to modify some of the poses to suit your level."
4,Great addition to your collection!,"I have only used the 39 minute flow. With that being said, I enjoyed it so much that I had to post. This is great for everyone. First timers will not be able to do the entire thing, so just watch the parts you can't do a few times and gradually you can work up to them. I highly recommend this one and I have tried many home practice dvds. The 39 minute sequence was well-balanced and the instructor's voice and delivery is not agitating at all."
5,Fantastic for what it is,"This CD is really excellent in its genre. Generally, I listen to more mainstream things, though I really enjoy most talented female singers. Karan Casey did not disappoint. I heard her live at an Irish Festival and her haunting vocals, often teamed with gorgeous accompaniments, keep me a big fan. The other reviews have covered her style quite well, so I won't even try to.If you have an appreciation for talented female singers and enjoy moving, traditional pieces, this CD is absolutely for you. And that's coming from someone who is about to go write reviews for Outkast, Linkin Park and TuPac."
3,"Irish is not ""Celtic""","I'm gradually being driven nuts by the misleading use of the word ""Celtic"". The Celts are only one influence on Ireland and that applies to music as much as anything else. No-one in Ireland speaks about ""Celtic"" music so please drop it."
3,Nice light; difficult install.,"I am very pleased with the appearance and functionality of these lights, but installation was difficult for me for the following reasons: a) there is not enough clearance for a standard conduit grommet nut; I had to file down one side in order to get the nut screwed down securely, b) the exposed end of the internal wires should be longer, c) care is needed in closing the cover because the wires want to slip into the seam. I'm not sure I'll have an easy time lowering the wire cover if and when I need to replace a bulb."
1,Do not buy the Aegypan paperback version!,"As another reviewer said:""The Aegypan (hardcover) edition of this book is a scandal and should not be on the market: almost every page boasts its typo -- most are harmless, but some, such as ""whore"" instead of ""shore,"" leave one breathless.""The same is absolutely true of the Aegypan paperback.Save your $$$ - buy another version - not that one! The typos are awful. Totally distracting and an insult to both Tolstoy and the reader. (I'm here on Amazon buying a replacement for that awful version of a truly great book!)"
5,Tolstoy Review,"This is a fascinating look at a man's journey to religious enlightenment. He is lost and he struggles to make sense of life and religion, asking the age old question, ""Why are we here?"""
1,Aegypan needs a proofreader,"The Aegypan (hardcover) edition of this book is a scandal and should not be on the market: almost every page boasts its typo -- most are harmless, but some, such as ""whore"" instead of ""shore,"" leave one breathless."
5,LOVE these vent shades!,I have a 2001 Impala and ordered a set of these. I can't believe how perfectly they fit. They were notched to fit around an obstruction and look like they came built in to the car. The plastic is good quality and the tape seems like it will hold forever. I couldn't be more pleased.
5,REO Trucks,"Excellent photo archive of REO and Diamond REO trucks along with some information about each photo, and basic information about the company. It's a little light on the history, model and production information, but then again, it didn't claim to provide this detail. This is a great photo companion to the ""The World's Toughest Truck"" by Ebert, Neal and Fijalkovich and ""REO Joe"" by Fine."
4,Quiet novel of painful migration,"Hardly any of the book is set in Laos and the previous review is totally out of line. The narrator is clearly of Chinese descent and swam to Thailand. About half of the book takes place in a refugee camp in Thailand, and most of the other half takes place in America. The communist disruption of his schooling prevented him from school study of Laotian.The book is very insightful and often funny about the affronts a sensitive young man faced in a succession of foreign settings, and the rejection by Laotian Americans obviously makes another one. I think the book is honest, the previous reviewer not."
2,Reinforces the notion that government knows best,"Kelman is preachy and high-handed as he equates self-interest with selfishness. He calls for ""public spirit"" as a credo for government officials, and refuses to acknowledge that the rewards received through service of others may provide sufficient motivation for leaders to serve the public interest. If one subscribes to Maslow's theory of self-actualization as the highest form of human fulfillment, one will have a difficult time reconcilng Kelman's approach"
3,Positive approach and full of hope and excitement,"I believe that Mr. Kelman has a refreshing and unique approach to government and the direction it needs to head. Facing the many difficult challenges in today's society, Kelman's approach is one that needs to be recognized and implimented. People in general believe in their government. If not, explain that to the many government employees who proudly serve this great nation whether it is in local government or in our armed services. Mr. Kelman, thank you for your approach!"
2,So bad it's bad,"I was hoping for ""so bad it's good,"" but instead got ""so bad it's bad."" Looked like an assignment for high school film class, with long sequences of people chasing each other through the park behind someone's house. It was quite similar to the scenes in the original Star Trek that take place on the surface of a ""strange"" planet, located somewhere outside Los Angeles. And adding colored filters to the camera lens somehow makes this a horror film?"
4,Great dirt cleaner,"Just started using this product cus of the reviews i seen online, must say this product has been good so far, I wash my face in the shower and use this after the face wash and it still removes a lot of dirt that my face cleaner was leaving behind even after i exfoliated .. So far so good ! !"
3,Not quite sure yet.,"I have been using this product for over two weeks on a daily basis. I have yet to see any improvement in the severity of my acne. I will keep using until the product is gone. Hoping it's a delayed action. I love that the ingredients are natural and then I read the main ingredient to be alcohol. Alcohol is very drying and acne doesn't react well, from personal experience. Hopefully it works for others."
2,far too drying and fume irritates eyes,"2 stars because it is natural and might be right for a different skin type- I have combination skin.It's interesting to note that the second ingredient in this product is alcohol. This is very apparent when you apply this product on the face. As soon as the pad got close to my face, I had difficulty breathing because of the strong alcohol AND tea tree scent. Not only that, but the fumes also irritated my eyes. I had to close my eyes to finish wiping my face with the cleansing pad.Your facial skin is one of the most sensitive areas on your body. Something this strong is not good for it. It left my skin parched. my t-zone more oily than before and my cheeks flaking."
4,I found this a Trader Joe's for $3.99,"It works pretty well. I like a lot of products with tea tree oil and I've had acne since I was 8. If it's too strong I would put a little virgin olive oil or water. I use to think I should never put any oil on my face because I have acne but, in my older years I'm finding out a lot of natural oils or healthy oils work good for moisture. Happy hunting!"
5,Great product for a cheap price,This really works for people with sensitive skin like mine. It removes all dirt and oil from your faces. You'll feel refresh after each use. I actually like the smell but its kinda strong. I will definitely buy this product again when I run out.
3,Think it helps for acne prevention...,"I'm pretty sure this product is helping prevent more breakouts from occuring and keeping small pimples in check if caught early-on, but I don't think it does anything to existing acne. It has a pretty strong smell, but that does go away once dry. There is a stinging sensation when used directly on acne flare-ups.Overall, I would recommend it, but only as a prevention product, to be used after cleansing. I would not expect it to cure acne.... at least it didn't for me."
4,best cleanser ever,I tried the cleansing pads because I read about the benefits of Tea Tree Oil. These pads work great ! I also love the cleansing lotion . In fact I've ordered several other products from this company and have been completely satisfied with the results. The products do what they claim to do. Oh Yeah my face looks smoother and clearer and cleaner without over drying. Much better than those expensive high profile products you see on TV. Will continue to use this.
2,Bad ingredient,"I bought this mainly for the tea tree oil , because I thought its easier and more convenient than mixing tea tree oil and lotion at home. But after reading the ingredients, one of the main ones is alcohol, and the bad drying type Denatured alcohol. I was surprised and very disappointed. This ingredient will cause dryness and irritation and make acne much worse. I will not be using these pads and I recommend you be careful before you do, especially if you have dry skin and fighting acne."
3,don't inhale,"The chemicals or oils in this stuff is strong! when i inhaled i started choking. That aside, I give it 5 stars for back and chest acne and only 2-3 stars for face acne because it's sooo DRYING! i don't need to use this stuff often because it works on other areas great but i wanted it for my face and it's too harsh for that."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this because it has tea tree oil in it. I applied it on my face since i have blemishes. And since i have back pain, it's hard to was my face. I bought this, thinking, all i'll have to do is wipe my face (sitting down).But oh my goodness! The smell is so strong! I couldn't even open my eyes (Of course, i didn't apply it on my eyes!!!). I just threw the whole thing out! All i have to say is buyers, beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Guys, watch out.","I only used this for about a week, and only nightly because I couldnt stand the very strong feminine smell.The smell can knock you down once you open the bottle, its that strong. It lingers on your skin afterward.It does do its job in cleaning your face though."
5,I'm in love with Desert Essence,"I'd like to know how I didn't hear about Desert Essence until now. All of the products I've used from them have worked wonders for me. I design, sew, and wear costumes along with lots of makeup. For those of you with skin like mine, you probably cringe at the thought of wearing makeup.Before I started using their products, I was embarrassed of my oily skin and how foundation seemed to drip off of my face after an hour or two after application. My huge pores sucked some of it up, and my goodness it wasn't pretty.I've tried so many facial cleansers, masks, ect. Nothing worked as well as these guys. These facial pads are great for a quick clean if you don't have time to properly wash your face, and if you work outside and sweat, then this product is definitely a must."
5,Best. Bra. Ever.,"I recently purchased this bra after being sized at a local lingerie store. It is the most comfortable and best fitting bra I've ever owned. I am a 38 DDD and was looking for a bra that I could wear with a plunging neckline for my wedding dress.This bra totally suits the purpose and is way more comfortable and easy to wear than I ever could have imagined.It is soft, comfy, and very flattering.I will definitely buy more Natoris in the future."
2,WET,THE USED BOOK ARRIVED ON TIME IN GOOD CONDITION EXCEPT THAT IT HAD ONCE BEEN VERY WET AND ALL PAGES WERE LIGHTLY STUCK TOGETHER AND RUMMPLED. AFTER SEPERATION OF PAGES ITS OK.FRED
2,SSSSSSLLLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWWW,"This production looks great! The concepts are clever and fun!The tempi are.....slow......painfully slow.....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.This can only be considered ""rollicking"" if one finds a chess game ""rollicking"".It's a good game, though, played on a lovely board by very fine players. It's just, with this kind of work, a farcical satire by Offenbach, they should be running around the court playing hand ball, not sitting at the chess board. It needs to have life, it needs to jump, it needs to Can-Can! But instead, musically we get a lullaby....a dirge!I suggest the CD version with Dessay, Naouri, Fouchécourt, Beuron, Podles, Petibon, Smith, Gens, Cole, Minkowski.....which you may purchase here, BTW. This version with no visuals is much more preferable than this sluggish DVD version."
3,It's a Hell of a Story,"Although I must admit I was somewhat baffled by the plot (most likely because I was trying not to read the subtitles and simply listen to the French), I thought the singing and acting superb. Our 14-year-old son understandably was not as enthusiastic nor was my husband, but there were times when we all laughed out loud. I personally like the opening scene - and wonder if the actor/singer were actually playing the violin (it looked convincing, anyway). Perhaps if we knew more about the 2nd Empire or a European lifestyle we would have ""gotten it"" more, too, but it was enjoyable."
3,A good tool,"I have just finished reviewing Investing 101. As the title implies, this book takes a detailed look at finances (personal) but more to the point it takes a look at what is a financial market and how to invest, as an individual, without, hopefully losing your shirt.There is a handy quiz to find out just how high (or low) your tolerance to risk is and based on this, the book continues to explain all the fundamentals about investing wisely.This book is written for a novice and the terms used are everyday and easy to understand. This book also describes the various financial terms that are used in the market and this feature was quite helpful.While I enjoyed this book, it focused more on families and less on singles - which is something that I was interested in. Also, this book's audience definitely is novice as there is very little in the way of intermediate financial information.This is a great book for somebody who is starting out or who needs to polish their knowledge."
4,"Easy to understand, great for ANYONE, surprisingly interesting read","Definitely not boring. I was expecting a rather dry, but informative read that would take quite a while to finish because of the topic. Yet, the author's style of writing actually engages you, and would engage just about anyone, young, old, poor, rich, or someone in the middle. I accidentally ended up with 2 copies and I actually did not return one, instead I have it to my boyfriend to read and he is also surprised that she was able to make a topic that to some can be painstakingly dry pretty interesting and really reach anyone who wants to know their financial options when it comes to investing. I would recommend to everyone, even those who think they don't make enough to invest.PS- This was written by the daughter of the account holder (Steven Ross daughter, NOT Steven Ross)."
4,Good Introduction to Investing,"This book is designed for beginners. It offers a broad introduction to investing in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. To my surprise, it also covered socially responsible and tax-favored investing. I really liked that the author spend some time explaining to readers how to read financial statements. This is not the only book that investors should read, but it is an excellent start.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
3,Investing 101,"An Overview of Investing in the Stock Market with emphasis on stocks, bonds, 401-Ks, pensions that is relatively easy to understand- even for the novice investor."
3,I didn't finish the reading,"I really tried to keep reading, but I could not go on...Perhaps investing is not an amusing subject to me. I have to say, for the beginner, it covers all the different types of investment options available. But in the end, I guess I still need to find that investment book that is a little more fun to read, for someone who wants to get started on his/her own."
5,the mani i admre my whole life,s orry m r dylan my english isn't justgood enough to tell you ow good yournew cd is.s jut tis thank you
5,Detailed and Powerful,"Booker displays an excellent knowledge and a passion for the word of God in this read. We as Christians feel the pain we go through here on earth for ourselves, others and the signs of the times. Yet, God is not a man that he shall lie and the author perfectly executes depicting this prophetic work truly from God. Compiled with biblical references and revelations this book will open any reader's eyes to the undeniable truth."
5,A Rhetorical Guide esp XXII,Should be required reading. A most excellant series of guides- revealing and dry rhetoric mask the heart beat of the American Experience. Easy to understand for those who even read @ a 5th grade level. The red leather tooled 61 volumes provide a most excellant sensorium.
4,they did their part,"i was happy to find this book because my father was in the 8th armored, 53 rd engineers during the war and i was able to follow his path from ft polk to europe. What i enjoyed most besides the historical content is that is written by a vet who 'just tells' his story as he lived it. It is a good supplement to the 8th story in 'tornados wake' it talks about the years as a cadre unit training others before deploying to the battle themselves. in addition to the combat experiences this piece is also a significant albeit sometimes thankless contribution i appreciate that the author took the time to memorialize his adventure"
5,Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii,"Bought the Logitech wireless mic for Wii. I did a lot of research, and there are not very many mic clips that fit the Wii wired and wireless mics. This one fits like a glove. If you are looking for a mike clip for your Wii mic, look no further. Make sure you buy the MY330, and not the MY320."
4,good generic alternative to canon inks!,don't notice the color difference between this brand and canon...I like having the choice of a cheaper brand that works the same!
4,can't have this one without the first!,"I really enjoy this compilation. It has a couple more tracks than the first Greatest Hits CD, and it plays for considerably longer --- although you can't really have it without the first, in my opinion. Taken together, these two CDs serve as great overview of Al's career from his very first days to the mid-'90s. I personally found the 2-CD Essential collection, which came out much later than the Greatest Hits CDs, to be disappointing, and it included 38 tracks overall! Altogether, the two Greatest Hits CDs only have 22 songs, but I don't consider even one of them to be a waste of space on the discs. Sure, the CDs are each sold separately, and they don't include any of Al's recordings from '96 onward, but they're still better than the so-called ""essential"" collection, at least if you look at them as a single entity rather than two separate collections. (In fact, you could burn them onto a single disc, but you'd have to sacrifice a song or two.)"
5,I LIKE ALL OF THE CD's,This cd i recomend for the yoda song. It is really cool. I saw on tv the there is a new wierd al cd coming out and is out because i looked it up. They say it's GRRRRRRRRRREA
3,Good....... again,Wierd Al is funny. This cd not as funny as others but it is pretty cool. So listen to it. You might agree
3,"Funny, but not even close to 5 stars.","His second collection of hits surpasses his first, and they're a tad funnier, but not HILARIOUS. Really kinda pointless."
4,Weird Al Yankovic Greatist Hits vol. 2,"Like the previous collection, Weird Al's Greatest Hits volume 1 (from 1980-1988), volume 2 is another histarical collection of the weird one's parodies from 1989-1994. The album has a newly recorded parody on it called Headline News, a parody of the acoustic, Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm by the Crash Test Dummies. This collection also includes Achey Breaky song, a parody that says what a terrible song Achey Beaky Heart is, and also Jarassic Park, a parody that talks about the book/movie. Then theres Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit parodied, Smells Like Nirvana. A song that makes fun of how no one can understand what Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain is saying in his songs. Among the songs this album, one of my favorites is UHF, a classic Al original that he wrote for his very own major motion picture also by that same name.... ..."
2,A couple of chuckles - but that's it,"Weird Al's CDs don't usually get stocked in this part of the world, so I came to this on the basis of his reputation and having heard a couple of his better known songs. I was sorely disappointed.First of all, Weird Al isn't really that funny. Sure, he's amusing in a sort of 'this is something the whole family can enjoy' sort of way, but he's not edgy and he doesn't take risks.Furthermore, he doesn't even really bother with most of these songs. I don't know if this is meant to be a genuine 'greatest hits' or a hilarious parody of the greatest hits format, but I'm shocked if it is, because a lot of these 'songs' are mish-mashs and melodies, with very little in the way of coherence or humour to recommend them.Anyone with a functioning sense of humour should look elsewhere. Perhaps there are better Weird Al albums, but I don't plan to waste any more money finding out.(The two stars are for the two chuckles I got from this)"
1,Gmat book not what I expected,Book was an old addition - 2000. No indication that I was being shipped an old addition.
4,He made my Brown Eyes Blue!,"This album is great. It starts off with a great heart felt tune ""Blue eyes blue"", which to me is probably the second best song on the cd. But, ultimately my favorite song is ""Bad Love"", what can I say? I love it. But this album truely is the best of Clapton, because it shows how diverse he really is. It has him playing blues, acoustic, and more rockin' type tunes, which shows how he is developed over his years of playing.OVERALL: I recommend this album to any Clapton fan, and to anyone who wants to become a Clapton fan."
1,The king of repackaging,"How many times can Mr Clapton (try to) rape his fans by offering up the same tired, repackaged music. This set is especially offensive as it compiled all of the MOR product this former guitar great has thrown at us in the last decade or so. Great for soccer moms to blast from their SUVs, just a huge disappointment for the rest of us."
3,Adult Contempary Clapton,"The Clapton Chronicles gathers together Eric Clapton's work from the mid 80's to the late 90's. There are some stellar tracks on the album including ""Bad Love"", ""Pretending"", ""Tears In Heaven"", the Unplugged version of ""Layla"" and ""She's Waiting"". But most the album is comprised of the glossy 80's junk he did with Phil Collins including one of his all time worst songs, the insipid ""Forever Man"" and his easy listening hits like the Babyface collaboration ""Change The World"" and ""My Father's Eyes""."
2,Clapton's best fluff recordings,"I really like Eric's work and listen to this CD quite a bit, but it showcases Eric's transformation to an adult contemporary artist, not the blues guitarist people know. ""Running on Faith"" from the Unplugged sessions is really the true bonus of CD."
2,Clapton was GOD,"If you want a good CD that is solid and you can listen to more than once, go buy Cream Of Clapton. It represent Clapton during his years with the supergroup Cream and also when he went solo. Cream of Clapton is a great CD and is my favorite. All the songs on this so called best of CD are nothing to compare to his early work. And to the guy that said that a lot of people weren't born when he wrote Layla, well no one alive was born when Beethoven wrote Fur Elise."
3,Eric Clapton Review,Clapton Chronicles CD is is pretty good I would recommend it to someone who likes to listen to this type of music.
2,"I may be a bit extreme in my view,","but in retrospect, I think everything after Cream is superfluous. Cream was willing to experiment, and Clapton's guitar style still had that ferocious and precise ""bite"" and exhilarating cleanness you saw on the first John Mayall record. What is there really to get truly juiced about after that? All his recent stuff is just so sadly tired..."
4,Good stuff in it,"This is an excellent compilation, but I think the last 4 songs are not worth being in this cd. More like filler material. Nevertheless, it's got some memorable tracks."
1,a nice cd to go to sleep with.,"This cd starts out slow with some soundtrack and Pilgrim songs. Then it starts to liven up with his '80s material but the last song with it's Madonna dance beat is completely out of place. A soothing mix of ballads and rockers. You would be better off to buy his other 1999 collection, Blues."
2,A horrible misreprentation of Clapton's career,"Considering that this compilation only covers Eric Clapton's career after 1981, I suppose I can't complain too much about the choice of material. But it is still painful to hear former ""God"" Clapton ape Michael Jackson on ""Change The World""...he might as well have been singing ""Heal The World"" while trying to keep his nose in place, and his older material, which consists mainly of slick pop-rockers and lounge-like ballads, is overproduced and sounds lifeless and bland.If you are just looking for a single-disc compilation, go for ""The Cream of Clapton"", which, although not perfect, is much, much better."
5,Perfect Clapton for my ears.,"I love whatever Eric Clapton writes and sings, but this CD is good music period. IMHO it is better than the Cream of Clapton. It has the obligatory Unplugged version of Layla, as well as Tears In Heaven; but it offers the listener the multi-level ear-candy of Running On Faith and the beautiful string-fingering on River Of Tears. A best buy in my book."
4,"Alternative to ""Complete Clapton""","When I bought the recent ""Complete Clapton"" album, I didn't realize that it was missing some Clapton songs I like, particularly ""River of Tears."" This doesn't have as many tracks as the ""Complete"" album, but I think as a listening experience, I will enjoy it as much. It would be nice if there was a ""complete"" album that really WAS complete..."
3,the new clapton,The cd is for you if you like eric's new music. It is really slow and has a good beat. I gave this cd 3 stars because I love eric's old music instead of his new.
2,What a letdown...could've been should've been...ISN'T,"just a disgraceful marketing ploy put together with very little thought. Sure a couple of soundtrack inclusions make it a nice item for completists...but what about a couple of gems like unreleased tracks? I have a bootleg ""UNplugged"" with a beautiful ""acoustic"" version of My Fathers Eyes...and Circus left Town. Too much Pilgrim..and nothing from several of his WarnerBros bluesier efforts...like ""From The Cradle""...a botch job on more counts than I have room for...too bad..Clapton IS the man...Warner Bros..should stick to cartoons."
4,OVERDUE 80'S-90'S GREATEST HITS PACKAGE,"""Clapton Chronicles"" is a long overdue 80's-90's hits package from Eric Clapton. Is is nice to see Eric recognize these hits, because he totally forgot about his 80's hits on his last tour for the then new ""Pilgrim"" CD. This is a nice package, but like all greatest hits by rock veterans, this misses some big hits ""No Alibis"", ""I've Got A Rock & Roll Heart"", ""Tearin Us Apart (with Tina Turner)"", and the recent rocker ""She's Gone"". However, this is still a nice package to have. ""Forever Man"", ""She's Waiting"", ""It's In The Way That You Use It"" and ""Pretending"" are the highlights here. The 2 new songs are good as well. The sound also sounds crisp and clear. No we can hope for Eric to put out a more ""rockin"" new album next year!"
3,This Clapton isn't really for me.,"For starters, this cd doesn't contain the stuff that made Eric Clapton a legend. He is one of the greatest guitarists to ever live, but in my opinion, he was made to rock, not roll. Some of the songs on here are very good, namely Change The World, Running On Faith and Tears in Heaven, but the rest seem unctuous and forced. I'm just a kid and I have absolutely no real grounds to call this music banal, but I think my preferences may be similar to kids like me who would rather a collection made by a rocking legend, not a lachrymose geriatric. So for anyone expecting Mr. Clapton's classics fresh out of the oven, beware. These songs are frozen, not baked."
1,Seriously?,"IMHO, this is the worst of Clapton. His early music was awesome, this music is main stream pop @rap they play on the radio. This version of Layla is terrible. It lacks the passion and desperation of the original. Somehow I think if Pattie Boyd had heard this version over the original she would have thought he was kidding around. You want to hear some good Clapton? Check out Cream, Derek and the Dominos, Blind Faith, The Bluesbreakers or just some older stuff before the radio friendly muzak started coming out."
3,Perhaps we need Chronicles two?,"Is it me or are greatest hits compilations becoming more and more problematic. Greatest hits are for the casual fan, the buyer who doesn't want to buy all the albums to get the hits he or she wants. the serious fan buys all the albums.But greatest hits packages lately try to have it both ways: by having the casual fan buy an additional two or three albums to get the hits missing from the anthology. He is being forced to spend money as a serious fan.Take Eric Clapton's latest--this greatest hits comp. Most of the hits are here, but where are the hits songs from the albums From The Cradle, or Money and Cigarettes. ""Motherless Child,"" and ""I've Got A Rock and Roll Heart"" are curiously absent.Basically, if you owned Unplugged and Journeyman you've got most of the tracks from this album. At 14 tracks there was room for much more--as in hits."
5,The Legend Continues,"A better name for this album would have been ""Eric Clapton: The Latter Days."" You will find more of a pop-rock sound than Clapton's typical blues-rock on The Clapton Chronicles, but that isn't all that bad. You will still get ""Layla,"" perhaps Clapton's most popular song, ""Before You Accuse Me (Take A Look At Yourself),"" and ""Tears In Heaven."" ""Blue Eyes Blue,"" which was written for Runaway Bride, and ""Get Lost,"" are the new songs. ""It's In the Way That You Use It,"" ""Forever Man,"" and ""Change the World,"" are my favorites, even though they have a new sound to Clapton's music. This isn't what your looking for if you want a greatest hits album, but still a great all around collection in many ways."
5,He's still the BEST,"In a career as long and as varied as Clapton's, there are bound to be different styles and a need for a variety of ""best of"" volumes. Some of us who are getting older like to hear different things at different times, and while this is great ""background"" music as someone else wrote, it sure beats MUZAK. . . and who wouldn't want to get on an elevator and hear Clapton? He is an artist, a musician, and he is entitled to take his music and package it as he feels at the moment! I love the old Cream, Derek, and other old stuff, but it's hard play that in an office. This music brings back so many memories, and the songs are all great songs that I love! I guess I'm just so totally in love with his work that I love to listen to it ALL!"
5,All my faves on one CD!,"Jewel case had a few minor cracks, but could hardly pass this up for the price... All my faves on one CD!"
3,This is all right....,"I am not an Eric Clapton fan, but I have enjoyed the songs he has put forth from the past few years, which are on this album. I believe you would have to be a fan to appreciate his entire collection on this album, otherwise it's not worth getting, unless stuck in the used soundtracks section."
5,Best grill I've ever cooked on!,"This grill worked so great the first time I tailgated with it I started backing my QX4 into the driveway and cooking in front of my house. The neighbors probably thought I was crazy but I've never had better steaks. I've put close to 5,000 miles on this and it still cooks better than anything else. I never take it off. I love the attention when I'm out too. Great conversation starter."
2,Bigger then expected.,"Holy cow this thing was hung like a horse. If you're into something that really takes up space, this is your toy. If you're looking for a toy with mild to moderate girth, this is not it. I'm all for rabbits and venus butterflies, but make sure if you get this one, you are a well seasoned player!"
4,WELL ACTED - BAD CASTING,.....It is difficult to imagine that Robert Young could beat out Errol Flynn in the lover department. The fact that Flynn makes it believable is evidence of his acting ability. This was probably Flynn's greatest acting role. Greer Garson was never lovlier and she must have been really lonely to fall in love with Young. It is a credit to her acting ability that she pulled it off. Robert Young was totally unbelieveable as the Bohemian lover and Janet Leighs part was a throw away that could have been played by anyone......The only pairing that made sense was Garson and Pidgeon and though somewhat contrived it is the way the movie ended.
5,so good,if you like errol flynn you will like this movie.its different from his other movies. its like a love story.but different. buy it and see what i mean
5,Very good movie,"I enjoyed this old movie very much. However, all the way through it, I kept saying to myself ""why didn't they cast Robert Young as Soames Forsyte and Erroll Flynn as the young ardent architect."" It was just the strangest casting I've ever seen. Walter Pidgeon was wonderful as usual. It was a wonderful cast and a good story well acted, beautifully filmed and well directed. I think any fan of old movies would enjoy this very much."
2,What to do with Errol Flynn?,"By the time Flynn made ""Forsyth"","" his debauched lifestyle had made him unable and too""old looking"" to play dashing swashbucklers. So, in an attempt to redirect Flynn's career, a string of studios cast Flynn in a series of high-dollar films that just didn't quite work, ""Forsyth"" being a prime example. Flynn was a considerably better actor ""in motion,"" than sitting in lavish drawing-rooms."
1,Filemover,"I wasted money on this purchase, my primary reason was to obtain the usb link cable, I found out there are no drivers for XP. So I wound up buying the JetLan USB 2.0 transfer cable which works great."
1,Bad shipment,"The product only arrived to me after more than a month... And in wich form? The box was soaking wet and also was the content.If the people at Amazon wants, I have pictures. The shipment was through Lanboxusa, so I can`t say who has the resposability of both, but the product arrived in unacceptable conditions.Miguel Cervi"
5,This is THE industrial CD.,"If you love industrial, you must own this CD. In my opinion, ""High Tech Low Life"" itself is worth buying the entire CD. It is one of the best songs I have EVER heard."
2,Santa Barbara habanero olives,"While the heat was there, we found these olvies to be soft and a bit mushy. We did chill them but this did not help. We would not purchase them again."
3,Great funny movie...,"I have seen this movie before so it was a blind buy for me...When I did get around to watching it, I though it was funny compared to the more recent teen movies. I find it funny when the full sized guy in the movie goes to some girls house he just met (a waitress) and saw a teddy bear in the house that looks just like him then the house is set on fire...The movie has many laughs but it does have some scenes that it can do without."
1,"I wish there were a ""no star"" option","I don't have a problem with people writing or reading porn, but there is a HUGE problem with this guy writing about little girls who get systematically raped by animals to harden them up for a life of prostitution. Is this what he thinks about? It has to be. He put way too much thought and detail into how girls got raped and controlled. It's disgusting and its wrong. I want to see how the party of ""family values"" will react to this and I hope they condemn him. He should be ostracized from any political and religious organizations."
1,Nasty Neocons,"For those who enjoy right-wing erotica, such as The Starr Report and Bill O'Reilly's newsroom sex tale ""Those Who Trespass"", Scooter Libby's ""The Apprentice"" is sure to please. Clearly inspired by his experiences in the White House, Mr. Libby uses vivid imagery and poetic language to take his readers deep inside a world of political intrigue, child prostitution, kiddie rape, and bestiality. The cigar scene in The Starr Report set the bar high, but Mr. Libby topples it completely with his titillating depictions of young girls being raped by bears. In a scene sure to anger PETA, a man has sex with a deer and urinates in its nose. If you like your novels nasty and neoconservative, ""The Apprentice"" will not disappoint."
1,Pedophiliac bestiality by a member of the Bush Administration,"Any review that omits the ""10-year-old girl in a cage raped by a bear"" is extremely disingenuous, as is the author. This is an illumination of a perverted mind. No wonder ""Scooter"" had/has no problem with bombing the youthful population of Iraq.Make that ""0"" stars."
2,Grimm Fairy Tale,"Mildly interesting but not a page turner, Libby's first novel is rather stilted but not a bad piece of work. With its lack of fully or even minimally realized characters and rather fantastic plot, it reads much more like a Grimms Brothers' Fairy Tale than a novel: goulish and wicked figures, crime, cruelty, mysterious events, and some strange an distant ""heroes,"" and stick figures who seem to represent a concept more than a flesh and blood person."
1,Ick.,"Why is it necessary for ""authors"" to go to such lengths to shock the reader? Did the pornography in this book add to the plot? No. This guy gives Laurell K. Hamilton a run for her money in the porn without plot department."
1,Who will be the bear?,"Soon, the Scoots is going to find himself a big ol' bear in the penitentiary...."
1,"Waiting for his next pillow-biting, page-turner","It's probably not fair to rate Scooter's masterpiece without reading it first. It's on my to-do list, after reading his forthcoming book, rumored to be titled ""Diary of a Jailhouse Snitch."""
3,Scooter's bizarre sexual scenes!,inclides scenes such as:a story about a girl who's kept in a cage and raped by a bear to train her to become a prostitute.
1,"First a corrupt Republican, and now a pervert?","It just doesn't get any better than this. What ever happened to ""traditional moral values"". It's traditional values to want to have sex with animals and talk so pervertedly, as Libby wrote in this book?And what's with Lynn Cheney's lesbianist talk in her own book.Something reeks of self-repressed perversion in the Republican Party...What is the saying? ""whoever smelt it, dealt it"". Well, looks like we have a lot of Republicans decrying the fall of morality when they themselves are prime offenders!Don't even waste your time with this book. Not only is it perverted, it's not even good literature."
1,Creepy!,"I couldn't recommend this book less because there is no option for no stars. Forget the bad prose and the total 'orientalism' of the plot (sad!) the whole pedophilia ring is just too creepy. I can't believe more people don't comment on it. And bestiality with bears and a prepubescent ""girl-child"" is just creepy and weird. Is this the lengths he felt he had to go to sound edgy? This book by Libby is horribly written and the subject is awful, sad and tasteless.And he worked in the 'family values' white house for the vice president himself!"
3,How many of you idiots have actually read this book?,"My guess is none. You read the lies and propaganda posted at your favorite leftist websites, then flood over here to write disparaging reviews of a book you've never read. Why? Because the author is Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, the demon du jour of the political left. How childish.Here's a little tip for you. Take a look at the reviews prior to November 2005. There is no mention of bears raping little girls or any other bizarre sexual scenes. Curious, no? I can't believe some of you aren't embarassed for being such credulous dupes.I hope Amazon.com will preserve their integrity and delete the flood of reviews that have come in the last couple of weeks by those who've never even seen this book much less read it."
1,"Go to Japan, my man!","Thank god this book is out of print. I lived in Northern Japan. I took the time to learn the language and the culture. The mystery of this book was not the murder that took place in the middle of a snow storm it was that it was published despite a weak plot and even weaker characterization. Stick with what you know, Mr. Lewis. Writing novels and Japan are not it!"
2,"Exotic setting, pedestrian writing","This reminded me of those romance novels where a computer program takes conventional plotting and the ""author"" applies it to an exotic setting and characters and spits out a story. For more complex, interesting characters read Snow Falling on Cedars or Amy Tan."
4,Interesting little novel.,"It's not a bad little book. Can't say as to whether it's accurate as to the setting but the language is crisp, the imagery is vivid. Would make a good screenplay. Give it a chance. Sort of like Mishima meets Stephen Crane with a nod to Umberto Eco.I'm no fan of Libby's crowd but it's better than I could do."
2,Apparently no black color available,"Ordered the dual zip & velcro opening Danielle Enterprises Monaco BLACK travel kit and received a FOREST GREEN one. This item was for a gift and I needed it within days of its arrival. After calling amazon customer service, I was ASSURED that it was a mistake and that my gift recipient would receive a BLACK one if I reordered the item and had it shipped directly to the recipient. My recipient received another FOREST GREEN TRAVEL KIT. Although he says that he is happy with the green one and will be keeping it, it does not match his black luggage and it is NOT what I selected for his gift. I am very unhappy with this amazon order.The opening of the bag itself is wide, which is good for finding items inside and getting them in & out easily. The 3 plastic compartments are somewhat cheaply constructed, but overall it is a good size and shape. Would be happy with the item if it were the appropriate color."
4,dealership level quality.,comes in a nice case. quick and user friendly. i am a dealership technician and i use frequently. very good
3,Nothing a strong editor couldn't fix,"There's a lot of good material here. But there's a lack of discipline in Faludi's book that detracts from the overall effect. First, she tries to do to much. There's good data and some very insightful anecdotal stories. But Faludi apparently felt compelled to through in every anecdotal example she could think of that had any relationship to the topics she addressed. After a while, it becomes too much noise and a distraction. Also, she seems unable to distinguish between truly compelling arguments -- of which she makes a number -- and forced, attenuated anecdotes. At times, rather than letting the evidence form her concusions, Faludi tries to force evidence to fit those conclusions. Not that I necessarily disagree with her conclusions, but Faludi's refusal to confront her theories' limitations ultimately hurt her credibility."
4,disappointed in book's heterosexism,"As a woman who is non-heterosexual, I had difficulty relating to this book. I'm now on page 400, and there has yet to be any mention of the backlash against lesbian women. Are we not women too? It's all well and good to read chapter after chapter about ""Women Who Love Too Much"" and dealings with the ""Man Shortage Myth,"" but these are issues that lay outside the scope of women who don't/can't date men.I would expect this sort of lesbian invisibility out of a Christina Hoff Summers or Dr. Laura book, but I guess I'd expected more from a self-proclaimed feminist."
4,Putting words to our experience,"A hard, serious look at the New Right's attacks on feminism, and the slow erosion of the hard-won victories of the feminist movement in the 1980's. I lived through this as a lesbian feminist pornographer, and its ramifications still affect me."
5,Pure Fact,"Isn't it increasingly obvious that the backlash figures Faludi writes about are among us? They have written comments on this very book that seeks to unveil their incompetence and shaddowed conspiracy. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps, since they never finished the 8th grade, most of Faludi's concepts are beyond their comprehension. The work itself is truly magnificant! The research is overwhelming and exhaustive - to a good point! I reccommend this book for women and men everywhere who want to read about the truth."
1,Narrow minded and inflammatory,Reading this book will enlighten you about one of the core problems in male-female relationships caused by extreme feminists like Faludi. She doesn't seem to understand the real differences (biological and otherwise) between men and women.What's sad is that some women buy into this propaganda and believe that they should do what they want when they want and how they want even if they've chosen to be married where one needs to compromise often.
1,Absurd by-product of Anita Hill brouhaha,"This became an enormous hit right after the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas brouhaha (remember that?). It's thesis -- that the media is anti-feminist -- was utterly disproven by the insanely large amount of hype the book received in that same media. At the time, I looked up 40 reviews on Nexis and 37 were positive.A curiosity from a strange era now long gone."
1,Gives feminism a bad name,"As a feminist, I find it crucial for other feminists to report the facts accurately and completely. The facts support our points about the outrageously unequal treatment of women. Unfortunately, a close reading of Backlash reveals wild, wild inaccuracies. When she was challenged about this by responsible critics in print, Faludi responded that, in essence, the facts were less important than the thrust of the argument. No dice. Poor reporting, and poor writing (which Backlash is full of), undermines advocacy. To get a sense of how spectacularly well a feminist agenda can be advanced, the writings of Julia Kristeva, Marina Warner, and Helene Cixous are a great place to start."
5,Great book.,"Susan Faludi's research and presentation of this long-overdue information was excellent. We used BACKLASH as a reference in some of our Gender Studies classes at Indiana University East and for information to help support some presentations during our annual Gender Awareness Week. Although women had no trouble identifying most of the situations described with their own experience, most men felt uncomfortable and defensive about the information in the book. Women tend to feel that their experiences are not isolated and that this book might lend credence to their dissatisfaction with the way women are still being treated as second-class citizens. Most of the men who were exposed to the information in the book, tended to believe (or wanted to believe) that the issue is exaggerated and that the research is flawed."
1,Feminism is Fascist Sexism Against Men,"Feminism is a philosophy of hatred, gender apartheid, and male bashing. It seeks to divorce men from fatherhood via abortion and maternal preference in custody cases. It is completely gyncentric, illogical, and unconstitutional. Men of the world, don't let yourselves be steamrolled by the Lesbian Left. Stand up and fight for your rights!"
1,not good quality,"I have an Oxo Good Grips Soap Squirting Dish Sponge. The sponge does not stay on; I have it fixed with a rubber band. I had a previous Oxo dishwashing sponge that filled from the end and did not squirt soap. The sponge did not stay on. The last Oxo dishwashing item I bought, in the hope that they finally had a quality product was an Oxo dishwashing brush. The soap doesn't squirt out properly. So, as far as I am concerned 3 times and, Oxo,you're out. I won't buy another of your products. Designs seem good; something is wrong with their execution. Martha B. Ashton-Sikora"
5,Great sponge for OXO good grips dispenser,"I bought these to use withOXO Good Grips Soap Dispensing Dish Brushand they fit and operate great. Soap flowed on them and they adequately sponged any surface with it. They lasted about a month a piece for a family of 3. Even rinsing after every use and keeping them in a holster - they seemed to get dirtier/nastier quick. I preferOXO Good Grips Soap Dispensing Dish Scrub Refills, 2-Packthey're sponges with a blue hard (brillo type) end. They lasted longer and stayed cleaner longer.All in all a great product, while no dish scrub brush seems to last long, OXO seems to do the best (I've tried at least half a dozen other brands)."
2,sponge,"They work for cleaning dishes with the handle that is sold separately. These came in a box that did not protect the sponges. I do not know where they were and what could have gotten on the sponges before I received them. They looked clean, but you would think they would actually be covered when they are new."
5,"OXO Good Grips Soap Squirting Sponge Refill, 2-Pack",The OXO Good Grips Soap Squirting Sponges are just what I needed at a fair price.
3,banshees&dust,"I remember loving this album way back when, and yeh, you read right: ""album."" I bought this originally in vinyl; I was a youth with angst and all that stuff; and the soundtrack to the early to mid 80's was colored with various textures including this package.Sadly, I don't think it stands the test of time, and a lot of the sounds are quite dated. Don't get me wrong. I love Siouxie's voice, and ""Cities in Dust"" IS a true timeless classic, but I don't think the same can be said about most of the rest of the tracks.But hey, if you want to discover or re-discover some of the more unique, underplayed-unerhyped sounds of that era, this is a good one to tour."
1,NOT ACTUALLY MADE IN THE USA,"I could have easily picked up a similar item from my local sporting goods store, and saved myself the shipping charges. But I couldn't find any that weren't made in China, so I decided to order online.Imagine my surprise when this item arrived at my home with a MADE IN CHINA label."
3,Good Show but a bit too wild at times..,"I thought that this was a good concert but at times he gets a bit too wild on stage... His shining moment was the April 24th 1981 tribute to his father... All in all a good show.. the video ""Dance this world away"" was a laugh riot..The thing that I did not like about it was he was crawling around onstage and at another point he is pointing at his head with his middle finger...I think that you should prescreen this for the younger set of Springfield fans..."
2,What kind of fool am I to buy this???,"A big one. This is very old. It is representative of what was so pathetic and tacky about the 80s. I was not sure what he was doing writhing on the ground like that. He may have been possessed by an unseen evil(he did date Linda Blair for a short while) or was feeling the effects of some type of social disease that was so prevalent in the pre aids 80s... But who knows,who cares?? This was the eighties at it's worst. This is for die hard fans only or for someone wanting an 80s flash back. Just keep the remote handy as this is something that can only be enjoyed in small (very small)doses. Did I love it? NO! But Rick loves himself enough for the both of us. So who cares??"
4,Go figure,"This is a great concert! This was made in '85 to help promote his album TAO which included the songs Celebrate Youth and State of the Heart. Was he too wild? No! The wildest thing he did was a somersault during Don't Talk to Strangers. Be sure and cover the kid's eyes during that. No foul language or lewd acts of any kind (middle finger?? what?). Even if he did, which he didn't, he's a ROCK SINGER! Wow. As far as looking funny - I guess she makes it up as she goes. Besides, I don't think anybody cares to remember what they were wearing 17 years ago. Why write a review on the same item twice and say practically the same thing? Someone needs to grow up and move on. I've noticed that after reading her ""see more about me"". I didn't know the Monkees were such music icons."
5,Rick Rocks!,"A great concert video that is now FINALLY available on DVD.This is worth having for several reasons, but I would have bought it just to have the video for DANCE THIS WORLD AWAY. What a classic. It's a shame this was never in heavy rotation on MTV. This song should have been a big, big hit."
4,Bought it for a NASCAR race,"We bought this cooler to take to a NASCAR race but decided not to take it in because it looked too big. It is 14x14x14 not including the wheels or handle. Instead, we used it at the campground and it worked great. The wheels are sturdy too. If using it inside, you may want to put something under it. It sweats a little. Worth the money for a large cooler on wheels."
1,no driver for cable,My windows 7 computer doesn't recognize the cable no driver came with it and no info other than cablemass inc. So now I have just another cable to throw in the box of cables.Waste of money
5,"Fabulous deal for the price and ""Sturdy"" ~ easily adjusted","It fits my dynamic microphone easily and snuggly ~ The material is hard rubber not cheap plastic and should last for years. Brass threads to scew onto mike stand very well tapped~no wobble. Easy to adjust to differant angles(pivots) and holds in place well, allowing good pick up of microphone for both voice and harmonica, without need for constant annoying adjustment ~ well worth the money."
5,No-shock mic mount.,This stage mount MY325 for microphones is quite flexible and well built. It Helps take out the noise when you need to adjust the stand or walk on a hollow stage.
5,Best Dynamic Mic Clip!,This clip is amazing. I originally used the one that came with my microphone and it was OK until it broke. This one is 10x more durable. It is made of thick rubber which allows it to keep its place and grip the mic much better. It's about a dollar more then the cheapest one I could find on Amazon and it is so worth it. You wont regret it.
3,unfortunately lacking in info.,"This had the potential to be a wonderful book, but it is lacking in the information that you would expect to get in the books of this series. The diseases and disorders section is esentially non-existant and the specific care of the different species is far too generalized and totally lacks detail. It is a very good book for beginners or those looking for overviews of the major species and their care, but that is about it. Still waiting for the Tortoise Manual - which is long overdue."
2,Too much peanut butter!,"I bought this book because I was looking for some alternatives to PB&J. Both of my children are now attending peanut-free/tree-nut free schools. This book has lots of ideas, but too many of them are variations of the peanut butter sandwich."
2,Disappointed,"Although this book has a few useful tipsI was disappointed with the recipesSuch as Pickle Roll.Piece of cheese and a dill pickle.Roll cheese around pickle is the recipe.Tell child how to wrap pickle around cheese and eat.Or ""prepare ahead of time""I was disappointed I paid money for a book to tell me to wrap a piece of cheese around a dill pickle and called it a recipe.Also I noticed repeat recipes.Even one side by side on two pages. (pg. 40)Peanut Butter sandwich with some orange juice.Next page, exact same, but add some raisins.Seemed to be nothing more than a page filler."
5,Purell Lover,"I've owned a Jelly Wrap Purell keychain for around 2 years now. I can't tell you how handy this is especially with young children! How many times have you been out and about shopping and suddenly decide that you want to eat at the in house joint at the store / mall? A quick squirt and your kids are ready! Playgrounds!!!!!!! Lord only knows what those little hands can find on the ground (feathers, trash etc) so when we get back in the car I have piece of mind by cleaning their hands with this and I always know where it is.I never replace my bottle, I don't want to rip my jelly wrap over time so I just refill it. Long story short, I can't just run out and buy a new one as I bought mine in the USA and don't live there any longer. Where I live they aren't sold and I can't tell you how many people have commented on mine hanging from my keys in the last year! Awesome item IMO!"
1,Waste of Money,"This is a complete waste of money unless you live in a 3rd world country with no access to soap&water. It leaves a sticky residue behind, with the consistency of slime mold. If you can stand having slime on your hands, this is good for you. I'll stick to good old soap&water."
2,Save your money,"Intriguing but dull, easy to listen to but hard to care about--critics can ""re-evaluate"" this period of Miles till the cows come home, and it still won't hold a candle to his earlier work or the scattered peaks of his later work. Parliament is funkier, Jimi Hendrix's guitar is more exciting, other people's minimalism is more compelling and fun. Buy it if you are a Miles collector and have to hear it for yourself. But if you want some quality electric Miles, get ""Live/Evil"" instead."
1,5 star performance 1 star treatment by Columbia,I won't go into too many details here. Others have written excellent reviews about this incredible release. This might very well be the finest of the electric era. The only problem is the complete garbage version that is still on the market. The contemporary masters CD from 1991 is terrible.I just got my hands on the Japanese mini LP from 96. the sound is amazing. When I compared it side by side with the US release the results were clear. Sonny Fortune no longer sounds like he was playing sax in a cave. Michael Henderson is clearly audible and dominant throughout. Finally Al Foster's Bass drum is present. Columbia needs to make availabel the most recent DSD remastered versions of this and Pangaea NOW!!!!!!!!!!
5,Original Fusion,"This is a true album for the artistically oriented. The clear-cutting sounds of Mtume's percussion playing compliments the rhythm section beautifully providing the baseline for Pete Cosey's rich feedback and otherwise unheard of guitar work and Sonny Fortune's versatile sax and flute playing. Miles leads this ensemble with his deeply melancholic horn playing and takes this group into musical territory that had never before, and hasn't since, been explored by a major recording artist."
4,excellent,"Miles Davis has a bad hip, was exhusted by drugs and the road by 1975. This, and its companionPangaea, were among the last gigs he did for six years after nearly thirty years of work.This does not have the inventionLive-EvilorDark Magus, but it is still an amazing slice of blues and funk jamming. The long funk excursions here eccho around that Japanese Concert hall. Stripped of the avant-expermentation Miles allowed his early 70s bands, this may be Davis at his loudest: the clostest he actually came to straight rock and funk.This might not be cutting edge Miles. But it sure as hell is a show not to be missed."
5,baddest,Miles lays down some of the twistedest organ lines ever put to tape. Guitarst Pete Cosey speaks of the devil in flaming tongues. You'll be hearing this music in your nightmares.
2,Often dull,"This is a funky electric live album with some distorted guitar solos and beautiful flute and sax playing by Sonny Fortune. Miles does not solo at anywhere near the peak of his powers--he sounds depressed or ill to me. The first two sides are generally cohesive and strong, if rather simplistic. Sides 3 and 4, everything after ""Maiysha"", are not nearly as interesting and are often downright dull. Once you get past the fact that the music is sometimes exciting on the surface due to its funkiness and screeching guitar solos, there is just not that much substance here. Miles' playing is certainly several levels below what he was playing on ""Bitches Brew"" and ""Jack Johnson"". Novices coming to Miles should also be aware that this is from the height of his weirdest electric era, which some like and some do not--but which was usually devoid of his lyricism and conventional beauty of large sections of his recorded output."
2,Kirkus had it right,"I loved Wild Girls Club and anxiously awaited Sexplorations. The Kirkus review is dead-on. This is the most boring book about sex I can recall reading. Where Wild Girls Club was witty, this is uninspired and derivative. Worse, it's not even a retread of Wild Girls Club. I might have put it down before the end (the ultimate criticism) but I was on a cross-country flight and needed all the reading material I could get..."
1,"Angled Photo Cell Night Light, 7 Watt",zero stars.. does not turn off unless near sunlight... even during day it's still on.
3,Elmo Mini Backpack,My boy loved this backpack merely because it had Elmo on it. We have not used it nearly as much as I had hoped. It is almost too small. My son could only fit a couple of small items in it to carry. We have had it for a couple of years and it has held up nicely.
4,Hard to Listen To,"When I first got this album, I thought that ""Without"" and ""Thunderstorm"" were good, but that the rest of the album were throwaways, but after awhile, it really began to grow on me, and the music slowly reveals itself to be more than simple industrial metal; with reversed drums and bizarre sound effects creeping in all over the place, I eventually came to appreciate this album a lot."
3,Better Speaker,"I wanted to read this book both because of the Speaker Series and because I will be going to London later this year. It has taught me about some of the culture and politics of that great land. Yet, John Major drones on about topics in way too much detail. I usually enjoy the first 10 pages of every chapter at which point he chooses to drag the subject into areas that often don't seem related."
1,Denial of Responsibility,"When the man who was head of the British government during the Rwandan genocide doesn't even bother mentioning the genocide where up to 1 million Tutsis were slaughtered in the most horrific carnage, or take responsibility for his government's deliberate undermining of UN actions to stop the bloodshed, then I find it hard to give this book any credibility."
1,do not buy out of respect for james browns body of work,"This cd is total garbage.I bought it expecting the old payback mix which melded all the old hits.This is that cheesy disco beatbox synthesised horn trash rehash of classic grooves.Something a DJ with aspirations of being a real artist would put together to make himself seem like he has some kind of talent.If you like that technopop trash fine, but if you crave the original styles and musicianship of the original tracks try finding the payback mix its like one big JB tune.Stay away from this one."
4,Mega 3D volume with ample audio range,"No gamer should be without this system. The sub moves some serious air while the flat panels pick up the subtleties in the mid and high ranges. The remote volume control + immediate mute button is a great feature - especially if your subwoofer is in a non-accessible area. The manual controls - volume, bass, and bass boost work just fine - but it's hard to tell a major differences between bass and bass boost when it's cranked.The mega transformer seems a bit chinsy - but hasn't detracted from the overall quality and reliability (1 year). Minor peeves include static when you change the volume quickly and lack of wall mounting for the speakers. But overall great looking speakers that create a great 3D surround sound affect - even for medium/large sized rooms.Compared to the Microsoft's USB Sound System 80 - I'm still staying with pure digital rather than out my sound card. 4-stars for the lack of USB option and the slightly premium price."
2,"Great book, but too many errors","I'm a teacher learning to create learning software for high schoolers. I bought this book in 2002 to learn AW6. It's been a great resource that has made me a proficient user. However, I'm disappointed that the files for chapter 16 were missing from the CD which are the meat and potatoes of the program. That alone cost it 2 stars. Along with other errors people have mentioned. To the publisher, stop being sloppy, lazy and cheap. CLEAN UP YOUR EDITING!!!"
1,Wait for Updated Edition,"I don't see how anybody can recommend a book which is obviously missing entire sections. I thought at first that the book's organization was just confusing me until I realized that critical parts were not there. For example, in Chapter 21, the exercises are all missing the actual step by step instructions.The index is also a joke which really hurts a book like this which people will want to use as a reference. This is really unfortunate since if you thumb through the book there are useful bits of information hidden away, but finding them is nearly impossible.They should pull this printing, burn it, and reprint after the corrections have been made."
2,"good for your library, not much more","alright, but a delves a little too much into theory and Instrucitonal design... not as much advanced info as I would have liked."
1,Nothing Great,"I recently went to a bookshop to see some books on multimedia. I went through the Table of Contents and flipped through this book. Took about 20 minutes to go through the book.The book is for the beginner level only.Nothing great about it. Some websites like ARC, Authorware Tutorial by Apurva and many more when combined together provide a whole lot of material.Too costly for a beginner level book. Waste of money."
1,authorware 6,"This is a HUGE mistake in buying this issue. Wait until the reviese edition comes in, there are too many mistakes throughout the book. Its fustrating not being able to finish most of the excercises because of typos or left out information."
5,A Perfect Gift,"This book offers something many guides lack: context and a true passion for the topic. The rich history and current culture where food and wine pairings are developed, is delightfully described with rare energy and insight. This is an ideal gift item for those you know who love wine, or are curious to learn more."
3,I bought it in June and it stopped working on Sept 1??,"It WAS a good camera, took very nice pictures and it seemed to depend on each packet of film for the colors??? I used it a lot and all of a sudden... just barely into 3 months of ownership,it broke.The film dragged after each picture and then it died....still drags but nothing comes out and I tried several packets of film....So much for a good camera. KMS"
2,Not As Good As You Think,I have an older polaroid camera that takes better pictures than this one. One must be careful about the distance between you and the object being photographed. Outdoor pictures seem to be the most problematic. The picture quality just isn't as good or consistent as it should be.
1,Polaroid Spectra 1200FF Instant Camera (Purchased on 03/03/2007),"cheep ,i return and didn't get my money back"
3,"Great Results, Easy to Follow","This Exercise DVD is easy to follow and you will see results if you stick with it. I always find that you are more likely to stick with the exercise if it is not to advanced. If you are a beginner, begin with this tape, it will get you motivated and this will help you stick with it. I love the tape and love the inches I have lost in the last 6 months. My tummy is where I pack on the weight and pilates help concentrate on your center. If a bit pricey for you try purchasing the cheaper VHS format.T. Alexander"
3,Good for beginners...,"Personally, I was a little disappointed with this dvd. I bought it after reading the other two reviews, but I found it rather slow and unchallenging. I've been using the Crunch Fat Burning Pilates and Burn and Firm Pilates for several months, and they both provide a much more challenging cardio workout along with the pilates moves. The instructor on this video also has a rather childish voice which got very annoying.However, if you're a beginner, this is probably a more ideal workout. The tips and motifications are extremely helpul and informative and the pace is good for not over-exerting when just starting out."
4,Good for beginner like me,"I like the instructor on this tape. I have knee problems too like someone else said in their review, so I liked the mat portion better that the standing portion. The standing portion does however work my upper thighs fairly well."
4,Easy to follow,"I've had this for a while and recently pulled it out of the closet and tried it again. I forgot how good of a video it is. Tracy is very plesant to listen to and she describes the moves very thouroughly. It's not a high impact video but it does get my heart pumping during the standing portion. It's only 30 minutes total so it's probably not enough if you're looking for cardio, but it's a wonderful way to change up your routine. You'll really feel like you did some good burning in your legs!"
3,"Good for stretching, bad for weight loss","I've been interested in Pilates, and since I'm a fan of their kickboxing for dummies dvd, I thought I'd give this a try. There's lots of good stretches and moves included, but I don't see how it can be called ""weight-loss pilates."" Yesterday I tried this dvd out and was hoping that my abs would be sore, but I barely worked them. I did the exercises and breathing as instructed; maybe the intensity needs to be higher? There's about 20min of standing exercises and 15min on the floor. Don't use this dvd exclusively for weight loss. I'll probably use this dvd once or twice a week to help limber up."
4,pilates weight loss for dummies,I am trying to lose the last 10 pounds. I tried this workout and I really could feel it the next day especially in my legs. I like the workout it is easy to follow. I just need to do it more often.
3,"Easy, yes. Worthwhile, no.","While I do feel that I would like a different pilates work-out, this one just didn't cut it. Her standing work is decent, your legs will get a work out. However, her mat work is a waste of time and left me feeling like I'd just had a warm up. After doing this workout, my quadriceps are sore. That's it. This pilates dvd did not feel like a complete work out. It focused more on the legs, specifically the quads."
4,great video,this is a quick and effective workout that doesn't leave you exhaused and panting. Not overly hard but hard enough to challenge you. I really enjoy it and use it 3 times a week.
5,fitness,"One of the best pay per views of the late 80's early 90's era. The whole entire show was good. Nwa WcW were cranking back then. It's too bad wrestling is not like this anymore. I would recommend the buy if you are interested in the old wcw nwa days. Since I recently bought the item, I would be willing to re-sell again in the near future because the tape is in perfect condition. Once again worth the buy!"
2,Dense for non-English / member of the realm,"As a U.S. high-school history teacher, I was looking for a mid-level biography / story of the Hanoverian kings to compliment my more ""American"" sources. Got through only the portion of this book on King George III, but found it to be dense and hard to comprehend. I can't say I have a strong knowledge of nobility system in Britain, and only a marginal understanding of British political history, which may have detracted from my enjoyment of this volume, but I found it almost incomprehensible. And rather than build my knowledge base, it left me zoning out every couple of paragraphs or so.If anyone knows of a better introduction to British politics in the 1700-1800s, I'd be appreciative to learn the title."
3,"Buy the previous three ""LIVE AT THE APOLLO"" albums first","With all the other JB product out there, I don't know why anyone would buy this if they didn't already own all of the man's classic albums first. That said, this 'greatest hits' live package proves that even in the '90s, James Brown is very much capable of bringing down the house. His voice these days is a rather pale reminder of the nearly supernatural capabilities he once possessed. But, as anyone who has seen him live recently can testify, his touring band is a force of nature and that is why this album is ultimately worth listening to."
4,Entertaining but not his best,"James BrownLive at the Apollo 1995This is an entertaining CD. This starts routinely through the first couple of songs but the energy picks up after Brown's rant during ""It's a man's world"", however, the energy is more labored than uplifting. One gets the impression that others are trying to lift JB up rather than JB lifting the audience. There is a nice live version of ""Living in America"" and the bonus track (""Respect Me"") is a very fine addition.This is a Four Star release."
4,Different view,"This is the first Sartre book that I have ever read. I liked it enough to read more from this author. There were 2 (maybe more) other sub plots going on that just left you hanging, I thought.I have not read much literature that dealt with WW II that wasn't directlyrelated to the Holocaust(sp?) or from an American perspective. That made, for me, all the difference in the world."
5,The best male singer in all of Latin America.,"Limitless numbers of Latin American male vocalist have had great impacts on their listening audien-ces throughout the years. But none have done so with the great intensity of Luis Miguel. He brings not only depth of voice, but unique presence of delivery. He is captivating not only for the sound he delivers but for the connection he makes with his audiences. He is truly the best and all who enjoy his works are pleased to have been here and passed through these moments of pleasureable lis-tening."
3,not a full album,"It pains me to complain, but this release is only 33 minutes long. Not a full length CD, in my opinion, yet it's definitely priced as one. It was a sad surprise."
3,Nothing outstanding,"This CD includes traditional ceremonial wedding music, and well as popular love songs. It includes both the processional and recessional marches. Canon in D major is a beautiful and romantic song. The only other songs on the album worth listening to are ""If"" by Bread, and most notably ""The Wedding Song (There is Love)"" by Petula Clark. The other ones are basically fillers. (Prime example: Corey Hart sings ""Can't Help Falling in Love"") I wouldn't recommend this album; search for a better wedding album."
2,could be better,the cd was ok but not what i thought it to be. it was not the original artist and it just was not that good. it worked becuz i didn't have time to go get another. but would not use again
4,Jewish magical realism,"I feel as though I know Karpstein personally. Reading this book, I was struck by the evocative prose and how the story held my interest as it wove a tale of a person that many Jewish Americans would recognize. The book creates a world that is familiar, and yet foreign, as in a dream; it is a synthesis of the monochromatic city (New York?) with its air vents and subways, and that vague sense of being pursued that many Jews feel instinctively (and for good cause), plus supernatural elements that rise from the landscape like subtle delusions.This novel is a work of Jewish magical realism, in my opinion; does this genre exist?It is sad, in places, and sometimes angry; but it is not bleak -- the author has even found some room for humor. I recommend it to anyone interested in the Holocaust, in Jewish-American fiction, and in hearing a new voice with something very interesting to say about survivor guilt."
1,Broken within minutes...,"I have used my other pair of e-drum sticks for close to 10 years with no issues and I just switched to the anti-vibe sticks to try them out. Within the first SONG one of the sticks broke half-way through, and I was playing on a rubber E-DRUM set... I don't even know how that happens! I rarely break sticks on an acoustic set and I have NEVER even heard of breaking sticks on an e-drum set. Maybe I just got a bad pair, but man, I am not going to gamble again with these. Terrible."
5,BUY THESE,"i have some cheap drumsticks and after using these drumsticks, i've realized how much the other ones are garbage. these are great and so far unbreakable."
4,Zildjian 5AWA//:Drummin it up!,I am really enjoying them thus far even without a drum kit to play on..THX!
1,glad i never saw the first one,"wow, after i saw the first reviewer give it 5 stars i had to share a piece of my mind on this movie. saw it a little while back and i'm glad i never saw the first one cause it reallllly must have beeen bad, wow. you'd swear this movie followed right behind the first one and was made in 73. this movie is incredibly badd! and i do mean bad. i don't mind some low budget b-movies but this tops the cake. you've been warned! movie is extremely boring and the costumes and storyline are just completely cheesy. no gore or blood even though you'd think otherwise from the cover. stay away or you'll be really sorry if you picked up a copy of this one. peace out"
4,"Scary Stories 3 By Micheal Jackson!!! at Pinecone High,NJ.","the book had all kinds of stories,one of theme was""The girl who stood on a grave"" That storie was werid and scary.It was about some kids haveing a party by a graveyard and they told this girl that if you stood on a grave the body under you would come out and pull you under.She told them that she was not scared.So they told her to put a knife in the grave then they would know she was there.When she got to a grave she wanted to stand on she stood there for a while then when she was ."
5,illustrations!!,"I read this book about 11 years ago in first grade, and I have to say that even though the stories weren't particularly frightening, Stephen Gammel's illustrations are still in my mind today. Especially that one of that dead lady's face. That always scared me. The other ones were only mildly horrifying."
4,Enjoyable And Fun..,"I reread this book tonight. I normally re-read this series around Halloween time and since it is near Halloween time, I visited that tradition. I still love this collection and the art is still stellar but it didn't shake me as much. But still a lot of fun."
1,BEWARE!!!,"Why would any adult let a child aged 9-12 read a story where a wife takes the liver of the dead lady next door and feeds it to her mean husband? Why would anyone with any common sense of decency allow any child to read about killing dogs, children getting a gun to scare off a ghost, and an adult KILLING A CHILD slowly & painfully because of grudge by using a ""voodoo"" type spell for revenge. What is wrong with the man who wrote these books? My opinion is that Mr. Schwartz is a disturbed and depraved person and he should seek help - not write childrens books. Even more is wrong with the reviewer who decided these disgusting and morally void stories were appropriate for young children. It seems to me that Mr. Schwartz gets his thrills by taking away the innocence of a young and naive audience. I hope he's happy with the psychological damage he is responsible for. PARENTS BEWARE of this author in your home, your schools & your public library."
2,"Wanted used, recieved new...","Was actually disappointed with what I received. Was trying to find the original prints of the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark series, mainly for the original art work, but received the new reprints with tamed down art work."
5,Yet another excellent story in this series!,"This is a reallllllllllllllly good book. Especially when Addie Fitch gets voodooed (ha, ha!). Well, but is the story ""The Wolf Girl"" true or not? It's hard to find out, but this is a really good ending of this series (well, except the only lunatic story is ""No, Thanks"")."
5,Scary Stories 3 Was A Tale to Chill Your Bones,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark 3 is a good book. I like it because I like scary stories. I would recommend this book for third through sixth graders. Some of them are gruesome tales. I like Sam's New Pet. Sam's parents are going to Mexico and a strange Mexican Hairless Dog (As they think it to be) is following them around. The thing is, it's not even a dog! You'll be on the edge of your seat as you read these spooky tales. The author is Alvin Schartz. He has written a lot of other scary books. I hope you like this spooky boooook!"
3,mixed review,"one sponge came unglued from handle after a day or so ... the other was fine ... my husband used epoxy to reattach, but that shouldn't be necessary."
3,A bit leaky,"Sometimes the soap doesn't come out, other times it spurts out in gobs or leaks out the sides. That being said, I haven't found anything better. So, we keep buying these. =("
5,Affordable and effective!,"For some reason, I initially thought that $7 was a bit high for just two replacement heads, but these are very durable, stay fresh, and are safe on my non-stick dishes. I found these replacement heads to be longer lasting and more effective than the original head included with my brush.Installation is a snap, and the heads stay connected even through my sometimes aggressive, ape-like dishwashing techniques.Overall, you get a great price on a solid product."
3,Quality gone down?,"I'm on probably my 5th refill set of these. I haven't bought them for a while, and never (until now) from Amazon. Usually I find them at the Container Store, or the grocery store or whatever. I'm not sure if that's relevant. Anyway - I was surprised at the quality of these... it seems they have gone downhill a bit.Sure, they still work, but they seem to get worn faster than I'm used to. It's possibly I just got a set from a bad run. I'll buy them again. I still like the soap-dispensing dish scrubber, and OXO is generally good stuff."
2,"Good brush, bad glue","The brush works really well. The pads are well designed and clean well. However, major draw back as other reviewers have noted is that the glue holding the pad to the base comes off after a couple weeks well before the sponge part shows any wear."
2,These things are upside down!?,The curved part is now closer to the handle. Seems to me that it should be the other way around.
2,"Okay, but not great","Actually, the scrubber refills are fine, but the OXO scrubber is not a very good product. The soap doesn't dispense as it is supposed to do, so I have to squirt dishwasher liquid from the bottle onto whatever I am washing and then use the scrubber to clean the dishes. The refills are not bad, just the actual wand. The Amazon price was good, and since I can't find a better wand scrubber system, at least, I can order the refills from Amazon at a good price."
2,Get a grip,"I was so happy when I discovered this dish mop and even more happy when I found replacement heads with the scrubbers.My problem is that the last four I have bought came unglued from the base while the pads were relatively new. I don't throwthem away. I use them without the base. I have to put soap on them, but, c'est la vie. Anbody else have that problem? Thefunny part is that the many I have bought without the scrubber remained glued together until I had to throw them away. Evenfunnier, I will continue to buy them--and hope they stay together. It's a great idea."
5,these have become what i grab first.,i initially tacked these onto my order because of the deal amazon had new good grips soap squirting brush and the replacement pack of brush heads when i intended to replace my long suffering Oxo dish brush but i am really glad i did get these extra brush heads and kept the old brush. i prefer this scrub pad to cleaning out the sink and my dishpan to the brushes. it cleans better and faster. i now grab THIS scrub over the brush for that chore. Actually its no longer a chore and my sink is happy i'm sure. It also did a quick and thorough job to my very burned on marinade and cheese encrusted nonstick grill pan that i have to hand wash. i love Oxo tools anyway but this i will reorder.
3,A good read,"This is a good read. Love this medieval period. Great research. The big problem is the lack of hard facts regarding Roger Mortimer (see the problems trying to get to grips with Hitler, who lived more recently!). The author does admirably regardless, but there's too much conspiracy theory here for my liking - the author might have all the facts, but the way he interprets them should be included as a bad test case in all LOGIC 101 courses. See where he states that a certain source is not believable on one topic, and then later on says that this very same source must have good inside information on another topic. Isab. pregnant is bad enough, but Ed II living to a ripe old age is a cracker (sure, the moon landings might have been faked too)."
2,Livro datado...,"Embora fosse importante na época do seu lanamento (há mais de trita anos) no se pode deixar de falar sobre este livro em um contexto atual.Em se tratando do tanque Matilda (do tipo II, i.e., Infantry Tank Mark II (A12)), o texto infelizmente discorre mais sobre as batalhas às quais o referido blindado participou do que propriamente do tanque. Para aquele leitor que espera encontrar uma história sobre sua evoluo, aplicao, virtudes, defeitos, curiosidades e detalhamento, uma grande decepo se apresenta. No que as operaes citadas (em Arras na Frana e em Brevity e Battleaxe no Norte da África) fossem importantes, mas ao final do livro pouco se sabe mais profundamente sobre o tanque.Os Apndices so importantes sobre o ponto de vista técnico com trechos retirados de manuais da época além de reprodues de esquemas mecnicos. Mas do ponto de vista mais didático, fica faltando um tratamento mais detalhado. Uma pena."
3,Not the current version of AirPort Extreme,"Please take note - this is not the current version of the AirPort extreme, it DOES NOT support Gigabit Ethernet. The current version is hereApple MB053LL/A AirPort Extreme Base Station (New)."
5,Great router!,"Got mine about two weeks ago and all I can say is that it just works beautifully. Setup was a snap, no webpages or reading a manual to find out what the default IP address is, or anything like that. I configured this thing in 5 minutes literally (I'm a geek though) and have not touched it since then. I'm using all the features, cable router, wireless, sharing two disks and printing (using a small Belkin 4 port USB HUB) and all this functionality is just transparent on my Mac. Wireless signal quality is surprisingly good considering there are no antennas hanging out the device. Also, the disk sharing feature works quite fast over wireless, but you really feel the difference if you are wired though (I'm using G). It has a couple of minor drawbacks in my opinion, (1) lack of GigE, I don't care about it but can be a dealbreaker for some guys and (2) pricey if you just want a router. Although, if you think about all the features it makes sense to spend a few extra $."
5,AirPort is Awesome,"Setup is easy and it works seamlessly without regard to OS. I have my iMac, Vista Laptop, XP Laptop (I need it for certain legacy programs that aren't compatible with Vista), and Linux all working off the same router without any problems. Definitely the best router I've purchased, over Linksys and Belkin routers I've owned previously."
3,Signal range is mediocre.,"The signal strength of this product is mediocre and I have experienced many dropped signals. I have an Intel Core Duo iMac and it is not able to take advantage of the n wireless configuration. Apple requires an Intel 2 Core Duo iMac in order for this to happen. Additionally, this is the Extreme that does not have the 1 gigabit ports, so even with the wired configuration, this router is lacking. I'm going to return this and find something much less expensive."
4,good hub and features; great hub after setup!,"Connected to this hub: 7 macs of various vintage, wired ethernet lan via ethernet switch, 3 AirPort Express base stations (for remote connection via ethernet port, AirTunes port, and USB printer), USB2 hard drive. All features work well. Faster and better range than Express; using all 3 ethernet ports and AirDrive for family shared drive (great for backup or shared files). Covers entire house over 4 levels and entire length from one end where base station is located.Only hitch was in configuring the AirPort Express stations, which required hard reset and use of WPA2 security instead of the old WEP; this required a couple of hours on the phone with AppleCare, but could be viewed as a comment on ""Express"", not ""Extreme"". After setup, everything seems to be great.Would recommend this if you plan to use its features."
5,Works Like A Charm,It was a little difficult to get it working with the AT&T 2-Wire modem. I had to call in to both Apple and AT&T before I got it working. I still am not sure how it started working but it does and it works as expected. I have a hard drive connected to the network and I am very pleased with the higher level of security.
4,"Easy setup, fast transfer, but low range","This base station was installed between a Comcast cable internet connection and a new iMac computer. Installation was easy.Compared to our old DSL service, the cable wireless combination is very fast.The range is limited to line-of-sight spaces in our house. The signal does not reach upstairs from the main floor. I thought it would reach further so that is a disappointment."
1,Returned it,"I bought it cause it could serve files, but that feature never worked properly for me... anytime transfers of any size happened, it would lock up and drop the connection. It was picky about which drives would work with it. Actually, it dropped the connection fairly often. I know someone else who has the same problems with the base station dropping the connection.I went back to using my graphite UFO base station to serve G, and started using my iMac to serve N to my MBP. Find a better solution like I did and skip it."
1,"NOT ""Apple Easy"" to set up.","My setup should have been super simple. (It was super simple for my old Airport Extreme) Mac G4 Desktop without an internal Airport card and an Airport Express. My simple goal was to send iTunes to my stereo via an Airport Express. After five hours of trying to get it working myself, I called AppleCare.After an hour on the phone with AppleCare, we finally got my Extreme to link up with my Express. We had to do three hard resets on my Express. We had to temporarily hardwire the Express to the Extreme with an Ethernet cable. Moreover, we had to manually copy and paste the Airport ID number from one unit to the other. This procedure was NOT in the owner's manual or in Apple's online self help!I have been using Macs at home for 21 years and this is the biggest headache that I have ever experienced in the world of Apple Macintosh.I think that the PC Guy on the Apple commercials got the last laugh on this one."
5,Wish all things worked this well.,I bought this to replace a Max G router and have never regretted it. I'm using a MacBook Pro and it works so much better than the other router. My old router used to have to be reset every couple of days because it would drop the wireless connection. This router has never dropped the connection in 2 months and it's smoking fast. I read some of the other reviews and can't understand how it could take five hours to set up. I was up in about twenty minutes. If you want a fast router that doesn't drop the ball this is the tool for you.
1,Make sure you buy the NEW updated 1GB version,Don't buy it without knowing you have the latest version that came out this week unadvertised. It has 1GB eathernet ports now. I have had some difficulty with devices dropping from teh USB port. Using and not using a USB hub.
5,Fantastic Router,"High quality interface with many top shelf features, this is not a watered down router. 11n speed is very nice, and the range is great. An added bonus is the ability to share disks and printers on your LAN."
1,Didn't like,Could not hook it up! Isp and apple customer service where no help. just plain didn't work!
5,Sounds as good as my $1000 home stereo!,"I bought the MH-700 speakers after reading a positive online review. I was not dissapointed. If you are sitting in the ""sweet spot"" (which is not a problem with a computer) the sound quality is simply amazing. The flat pannels have as clear a sound as I have ever heard and the subwoofer delivers crisp clean base. The volume control is convienient an easy to use. I found only one minor issue. In order to get the best sound you have to be in the sweet spot. From the side, the sound in not as clear. But hey, these are computer speakers so they are meant for you to be sitting at the computer. Overall, incredible sound for the money."
5,Pretty darn good,I am really pleased with the sound quality of these speakers. They image very well and are not offensive. I did have to bend one of the stands so the rake angle would match it's mate. The panels are made in Canada and the sub in China. Highly recommended.
2,Sounds great (when it works),"The first Monsoon MM-700 that I purchased was DOA (dead on arrival). The subwoofer had a ""short"" since sound would only come out of one speaker. When I returned it, the seller didn't raise a fuss. He implied that he's been having a high return rate for Monsoon products because of defect.I received a new subwoofer and it worked and sounded terrific for three months. As with my first Monsoon, the subwoofer ""shorted out"" and sound is only coming out of one speaker. I couldn't get any warranty work from Monsoon and the cost to get it repaired out of my own pocket is high.If it wasn't for the poor quality work control problems with this product, I would have given it high marks."
4,"Where the action's at, baby!","Is the guy who wrote the previous review dead or somethin'? How could looking at hundreds of different naked women ever be boring? Street of a Thousand Pleasures has some of the most beautiful women you'll ever see in a movie, period. I was expecting Way Out Topless to be more like Russ Meyer's Mondo Topless (a classic of the genre) so I was a little dissapointed but there's plenty of vintage teasin' action to be seen. Pasties and g-strings are the thing here, bub!Be sure to check out the extras too! Lot's more action on tap here also.."
5,Blackwell,"My wifes cousin Preston Glass produced this first CD for Alfonzo and their collaboration is great as is this CD. Hermina, the song for, and named afer her will be a saxaphone classic. I had to have this CD."
1,Not worth the registration hassles,Software isn't bad. It's actually quite usable. But you'll feel like a circus animal after jumping through all of the hoops to get the software registered. If you have to wipe out the machine and reinstall the OS after a virus or change machines then you're almost better off forking out the money for a new copy. My time isn't worth more than the time required to deal with trying to get in touch with someone and get the software reregistered. 3 stars for doing what it claims to do reasonably well but 0 stars for treating the customer like a degenerate criminal when trying to get the program registered to work.
3,Just trying to help,"I am 70 and not very fast at learning complex things. All I wanted was a way of scanning text files, like Tables of Contents of music books, in order to put them into an Excel file for searching. I can scan them into Word, but I get the editable text in a frame that I can not transfer to Excel. The clue must be in the manual. I will keep looking.Such a project used to be simple, but today's software programs are too complex."
1,Outdated Software,Product should be given away free. Even then it would be over priced. Company was of no assistance and only wanted to sell you something else to replace it.
1,Readiris Pro 11,This product didn't work as well as the Readiris Pro 9 I was replacing. I upgraded as I had a big project of scanning obits for my genealogy society. Don't waste your money on it as I did! I should have listened to the other reviews.
1,Software,Doesn't work at all! Do not buy this software.Can not convert to Word or Exell when you scan.
4,Readiris User,A very fast and accurate orc software package. Very good for the person who needs an occasional document scanner. I haven't used it enough to determine the full capabilities.
1,Fool me once - shame on you,"The good: works like it is supposed too! scans to pdf image over text which is allowing me to shift towards a paperless workspace.The bad: you need to request an CD key over the internet for every time you have to reinstall - hard disk crash - or reinstall because the default installation is incomplete - or re install for a second or third language - install for a second computer at home.The ugly: Not only will they not send me a CD key - they won't even answer my emails! - The link in the customer service section for support in North America is dead - check it yourself - 404 - and the first email is ""We are sorry to hear that you are having problems with our software - please send us your machine ID."" - So you send them the information and you don't get a reply. Now I have been ripped for 100$!Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."
1,Horrible Customer Support,"Similar experience to many others here. Despite paying a lot of money for a physical product (not a download), including a unique serial number, every reinstall requires a new ""registration number."" US customer support always rolls into voicemail, and calls are never returned. I finally chose the menu choice for their server products and got a real person. He stayed on the phone until I was connected to John P. in customer support. He gave me the number I needed within 15 seconds. When I asked why calls were not returned, he said there were 5 technical support people and they had three promotions running. Not much I can do now, except vote with my wallet in the future."
2,disappointing performance,I had to look for the setup.exe file since it would not come up automatically. text recognition kept crashing which was really frustrating because it would not save anything. Crashed about five times then I uninstalled it and returned it after wasting a weekend trying to give the software a chance.
1,Worst design ever!!!,"The angle of the handle keeps the sponge/scrubber head from flatly touching the bottom of a pot, even a small 3 quart pot. The handle hits the rim of the pot and all you do is scrub with the tip of the sponge unit. Unlike other soap dispenser scrubbers that drip a small amount of soap into the sponge this one has a hole in the center and you have to shoot out about a quarter size amount of soap with every item you clean. The scrubbers last about 2 weeks with dishwashing 3 nights a week.OXO if you read this you should scrap this and start over! Do not buy this product."
2,A rare miss for Oxo Good Grips,"Pluses: soft brush works well on everything, including non-stick items. Grip is comfortable.Minuses: the brush leaks. the cover on the handle opens up when cleaning glasses because the bottom of the cover sticks out too far. doesn't always squirt when it should. sponge falls off frequently.In short, stick with the cheaper brushes you can get at the supermarket."
1,Leaky,"This thing leaks. I've got two and they both leak. If you store it sponge-side down, you'll have a puddle of soap in your sink. If you store it sponge-side up, the handle will be covered in soap. There's an older model where the sponge sort of ""twists"" on that doesn't seem to leak so much, but I cannot find refills. I hate how much money I've wasted trying to make this work!"
4,"Not perfect, but better than anything else","I've tried 4-5 scrubbers. Most wear out or clog up quickly. The ones from the supermarket are always changing, so when I need replacement sponges, they never fit. This one is more expensive, but it works and it last a long time, so it's cheaper in the long run.I have two. The other one has the pot scrubber head. It works great on badly stuck on pans from pot roast and the like.I have only had the head come off a couple of times and I use it for everything. When it did, there was gunk on the mating surface. I just cleaned it off and reassembled.Neither of mine leak at all. We store ours sponge down in the corner of the sink. I've never had a puddle of soap."
1,"Good looks, but dysfunctional","Pros:Looks goodComfortable handleCons:Mechanically dysfunctional - both I've owned:Leaks.""Squirt"" button breaks easily.For over 20 years, I've owned lots of dish sponges, mostly no-name products that have worked reasonably well. The Oxo product is the best looking, but least functional of any. I've purchased a few other Oxo products, but ultimately returned them due to poor quality."
1,Rubber 'squirt' button breaks easily,"I have had 2 of these and they are both terrible.* The rubber button which you use to squirt soap breaks easily (ie. ruptures) at which point there is no more pressure and it doesn't work anymore.Even before the rubber breaks, it doesn't fit well and leaks soap."
4,C.O.C.,Yea so it's a bootleg. Deal with it. I haven't seen it elsewhere and its a great cd. Plus all the tracks came up on my itunes. It's worth the 3+ week wait.
4,Mr.Food ... Good recipes,Have used several recipes out of this book. Pleased with results. Prompt delivery of item. I would recommend to anyone interested in grilling recipes.
4,An interesting look at an underrated coach.,"In this autobiographical book, Jud Heathcote discusses his career. There is an interesting look back on his pre-Michigan State days as well as his championship run. He also spends time discussing many of the great players who have played for him, including the most famous, Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson"
1,NNNOOOO,"Well yes the girls are definately hot. The biggest problem is with 2 scenes. The first is a bunch of naked guys playing hokey. and the other was a bunch of naked guys, I threw out the DVD before I found out what was happening. if you're into this then great but it definately isn't for me."
1,Very Disappointing,"Based on earlier reviews, I had high hopes for this book. The jacket cover made it seem promising. I was very disappointed. There was never a time when the book caught my interest - nor made me wish to finish the book. At page 100 I put it down to pursue other books. If you are a Christopher Rowley fan, you may like this one too - but if you are not, I recommend that you stay away."
1,Was this written by a child?,"The language is incredibly simplistic (it starts with the equivalent of ""Once upon a time""), the story is full of stock characters, and the book never held my interest for a minute.Don't waste your time or your money."
1,DiplomaticMarine,This video is terrible! It is very boreing. Not much action goes on in this video. I highly do not recomend it.
5,Songs of the Civil War,"This is, simply said, just a great album. You won't be disappointed if you buy this one."
2,Low budget documentary,"Interviews of average cosplayers at a convention go on and on with the same boring questions. Example: ""Do you have a vast knowledge of cosplay?"" Answer: ""Yes."" Another example: ""What's your favorite anime on TV?""Besides the tedious content, the video and audio were amateurish as well. Disappointing."
3,candy box,This box looks cute in the picture. I actually didnt like it as much. It had scratch marks and lookssmall. Not what I expected quality wise.
5,Absolutely wonderful,I just received this book two days ago from Amazon. I casually opened it and began reading. I could not put it down other than to run downstairst to try the different aspects as George and Lorne describe them.It is extremely cold here so I drove over 30 miles to the dome to try the concept as I understand it. It seemed so easy. I cannot wait to get on the course.
2,"Very little substance; lots of ""all about me""","This book contains very little actual ""instruction"" on how to have a natural swing. Mostly, the author talks about himself and what he did over the years...but not instructions. I was looking for actual ""steps"" on what to do to improve my swing, but did not find it in this book."
3,condition,"the condition of the book is not as described, back binding is worn out, pages are ready to fall out"
3,not impressed at all,This book was written many years ago and it seems dated. I say this compared to Ben Hogan's 5 lessons which was written 50 years ago but still seems relevant as ever. It was OK but not as great as the reviews I read. The instruction seemed a bit vague for me.
1,total crap,"Do not waste your money. This film sucks. The acting is horrible,it is not scary in any way. Save your money for something better."
1,A Real Waste of Money!,"This was the slowest, cheapest, more boring movie I have ever bought, and I have over 1,600 movies. When you read the description, you think that at least you will see the actors performing the satanic ritual that gets them into trouble. You don't. They go for a ride into the hills. After that, you watch them un-die through what seems like a painfully slow moving 2 hour acid trip. I don't think I'll even give this movie away to get rid of it: it's going into the round file."
3,Falls short of expectations,"It does not appear to be a bad book. However, too much time is spent discussing the ingredients and not enough space is devoted to recipes. Certainly some discussion of raw ingredients is useful, but fully 1/3 of the book is devoted to it. If that's what you want, this is the book for you. There are other books covering Hawaiian recipes that are better choices if your emphasis is recipes."
2,Roy Cooks but must have more to offer,"Book is really a disapointment. It seems to suffer from being a companion book to a TV program and so does not stand up as a cookbook on it's own right. I buy cookbooks for inspiration and ongoing learning but don't care for watching TV Chefs. Chef Yamaguchi it seems is a very creative cook ,but if you are going to try to sell books for $32.50 it needs more stuffing. I want to know more about how he thinks and were his insparation comes from. I feel that bought Sam Choy and Alan Wong offer more of this to my understanding. I would have also liked to have the English names listed in the recipes. I spent a lot of time looking in the Pantry section to find out what the differant ingredants were."
5,"Good holster, buy it from amazon","This is a good holster for my V220. It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did. For a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt. One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be, so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well. and also because it holds it where the strap is, it adds a little wear to that area. Other than that its a good holster for the price. And thats another one of my problems. I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall, which was highly over priced for my standards. Amazon seems like a great place to buy it, but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories, then you can find a site with free shipping for it, and its 7 bucks. Theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks, but with shipping. I trust amazons shipping though. So if you want a functional holster, get this one."
1,Stop the phone abuse!,"This holster offer's your phone ZERO protection. Not to mention the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster. While it does allow the phone to swivel, thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated, I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead.Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement.All in all, I would NOT recommend this holster. I'm shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak..."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"While this is a functional holster, be aware that you may -- like me - find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster. I know, I know. You can turn off the ""answer phone when opened"" option, but that is not preferred by everyone.You may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely."
3,The Best of Nakai: In Beauty We Return,"I was expecting only flute music, which I like. This was found in the first part of the album but later the music began to sound more like jazz, which I'm not partial to.Donald McCrory"
5,In beauty we return by carlos nakai,as usual carlos nakai leads the mind and body on a fabulous journey with his mystic music. He is a favorite of mine since I first heard his flute music in the early 80's and will continue to be a favorite addition to my collection. Thanks for always having what I want
3,Bai Ling's Goodies are the Best Part of this Movie,"Gene Generation is another Lion's Gate Special direct-to-video opus. Its a CGI filled Sci-Fi actioner based on a comic called ""Gene Hackers"" or something.In the future, scientists have created a way for people to wear their intestines on the outside. One really bad scientist (played by Faye Dunaway - no kidding) gets really caught up in her work and must find another scientist and his special gene morphing glove (sure, why not?) for a cure. Bai Ling stars as an assasin who lost a bet (I am guessing about that) and must wear Joker makeup and crazy outfits in public while murdering and committing other acts of mayhem.Is this movie worth watching? Well, not really. The music is nice and you do get to see Bai Ling's booty, there are some decent action sequences but the rest of the film is kind of a mess. The CGI is cheesy too. 2 stars for the booty, 1 star for the movie."
3,Futuristic Scare,"I bought this video because I love the work of Alec Newman, one of the main actors. He was amazing."
1,Awful. Just awful. So awful it was too awful for words.,"I have read tons of cyberpunk books and seen the related films. I have seen Ghost in the Shell the movie and the TV show. I have seen Gattaca. I have seen Outland with Sean Connery. I have seen Solaris in the original and George Clooney version. I could name most of the Hong Kong action films of the 1990's and most of the sci-fi or anime films of the last 20 years.But it doesn't matter. My credentials don't matter.I found this listing purely to warn others. By any possible use of any human standard, or alien standard, this movie was awful.The plot was laughable, the characters were absolutely sophomoric, and the special effects were primitive. It was so boring to watch that we turned it off halfway through and wished we had done so a lot sooner.It was so bad, even beer didn't help. Bai Ling tried but it was hopeless. Do not buy, rent, or watch this movie. You will waste your money."
2,FX FX..N' MORE FX,"I went into this one expecting..nothing. I usually will watch a Bai Ling film, and then ask myself why, surely it is not for the obligatory [...] shots..surely. This one was a bit better than most anything else she has done in a ""star"" capacity. The computer generated effects though obvious where not that bad, and the action sequences where fun and well shot. Bai Ling has not yet reached the level of 'actress' yet, but does pull off about 75% of this flick pretty well. Unfortunately her talent, or lack there of does show through in enough scenes to reinforce the rumors of her inabilities. Costuming was a hoot. Bai Ling spent most of the film running around looking like an stand in double for Tomb Raider, and I thought the colorful make up detracted from the character.All in all this was not a complete stinker...but it did fall to pieces in the last fifteen minutes...it was still entertaining."
2,Bai Ling,"One of the reviews I read on this movie compared it to Blade Runner, that and Bai Ling supposedly showing a lot of skin was the two reasons I bought the movie. Bad Choice. The CGI was pretty good and Bai Ling wasn't as bad as usual in this sci-fi action wanna be. The spurting blood scenes looked like they were produced as a high school project, the story was uninteresting, the characters were not likable enough to make you care. Good for a rental but not something to add to your collection."
