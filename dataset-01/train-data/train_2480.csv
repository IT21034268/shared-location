3,"Fun, but SHORT!!!!!","I loved this game at first, I was addicted!!!! But I was so very annoyed that it took me forever to be able to play it, it had so many glitches that I had to put it on my Dad's new computer in order fo it to run at a good speed. Word of advice, if you have an old computer or a computer that runs the least bit slow it won't run fast at all. Another thing I was annoyed about is that after the week it took me to play it, it was OVER!!!! I thought that maybe you would have advanced to Chief of Staff instead of Intern but it just congratulated you on becoming a resident at the hospital and then the game was through!!!! So if Legacy Interactive does make an Emergency room 2 I hope that they let you continue and make the gameplay longer!!!! But other than that the game was fun, for a little while!!!! Hope this review helped!!!! Meghan :)"
3,Cheesy but cute and entertaining,You can tell its from the 80'sIts very cheesy but also entertaining watching the guy pursue his dream girl

5,great show,forgot how much i missed this show! hope they bring back all of the great old shows from Nick in the 90s
5,I HAVE WAITED FOREVER FOR THIS SHOW TO GO ON DVD!!!,OMMMMGGOOSSHHHH I love Hey Dude so much....when I was a lil girl I used to watch it & pretend my couch was a horse & Brad was my sister & Ted was my boyfriend...this is my favorite show of all time. For real. Thanks to whoever for finally making DVDs of the series!!
5,Saddle up for another gift from Shout Factory,First of all thank you Shout Factory. You guys are great. First you release Designing Women and make me very happy. Yeah Im a guy but I don't care I love those chicks. Then you make all my dreams come true by releasing the remainder of Dragnet. Yay!!! And now Hey Dude. I loved this show when I was a kid. I was six when it came on and the only thing I ever watched on Nickelodeon was Nick at Nite so this show was perfect for me. Mr Ernst was my favorite character. Why? I guess I'm not sure. I remember hating Brad and thinking she was very unatttactive. Boy was I wrong. Kelly Brown (Brad) is smoking hot. So after watching one episode and not really liking it like I used to she kept me watching and I rediscovered after 22 years just how good this show was. Can't wait for future seasons to be released. Again thank you Shout.
5,5 quart chili pot,This is the bast pan i ever had i just love my new pot what more i can i say about my new pot
1,Not to be deceived again,"First Amazon doesn't make it obvious, if even possible to address problemsor place orders by phone.So this being my first order from them it will be my last.I did not want hard-anodized. The product description that I went bydid not say hard-anodized as other product descriptions did.But that's what I got.Now I'm stuck with something I don't want and still have to shop for theitem that I do want.You suckered me once Amazon, never again."
4,Use it all the time...,I love this pot and use it all the time. The only thing I don't like about it is that it has a cheap non stick coating. It's not the good Teflon coating.
5,Calphalon Chili Pot,"Arrived in time for Christmas with 3 days to spare. And I waited a little late to order. Pheeew! Well wrapped, A-One condition. Very good, on Special price. I do like to buy Calpalon on sale! Wife loves it. We eat a lot of chili, stews, soups- things requiring 1 large pot- and this fills the bill."
2,It was NOT what I thought,"I returned this Chili Pot immediately. I was terribly disappointed with the cheap-looking appearance. It was nowhere near the quality of my other Calphalon products, including the ""Kitchen Essentials"" line. The price should have been the tip-off, or more likely the ""rip-off."" The handles felt rough, the pan didn't weigh much, which was probably the best feature and I wasn't convinced about the non-stick coating. To be fair, I didn't use it. I have no idea if the pot will hold up to my chili recipe. I decided to recoup some of my money and return it. Maybe Calphalon can re-submit a clearer photo of this product. I will continue to purchase other Calphalon products of higher quality."
2,Warped bottom,"This seemed like a nice pan, but after a few uses, the bottom is warped. It won't sit flat on a glass cooktop."
5,Terrific all-purpose pot,"I received this pot as a Christmas gift and have used it already for so many things - sauces and soups, of course, but also to boil chicken (it holds 4 ample-sized chicken breasts nicely). I imagine that it will hold a dozen or more eggs for when I boil them to make Easter eggs, too. I like that it's shorter than a stock pot and I feel the contents get heated more quickly. I have some of the more heavy Calphalon pieces, but appreciate this chili pot's lighter weight. The handles and lid seem just fine - it was made for household, not commercial, use after all. Worth the price and a great gift for the cook in your family."
2,Wonderful but bottom warped after a while,"Wonderful at first! - but bottom warped after a while. I have a glass cooktop and, like the other reviewer, the pan warped. Maybe I cooled it off too quickly by putting it under cold water, I'm not sure, but it doesn't heat evenly now of course."
1,Poor Quality I returned the item,Poor QualityThe weight and gauge of the product was not up the Calphalon products.
4,"Excellent saw for the money, for contractor or home owner.","I am a contractor with over twenty years, and ten circular saws of experience, I'm very impressed with my new Bosch saw. This saw felt heavy ended and awkward the first time I used it, but, it didn't take me long to adjust, it's very smooth starting and very well balanced while making cuts. The power is what really impressed me though, I have been doing a project using a lot of rough cut, air dried hemlock lately and this saw never bogs down, even when cutting through a twisted knotty piece 2 full inches thick! The saw dosen't ""jerk"" when you pull the trigger, which is very impressed two of my carpenters enough that they asked me to replace my 2 Makitas with new Bosch saws! I admitt I purchased this saw because of the price first, reviews second, I'll buy my next one for the superior performance. I have only one complaint, the bevel adjustment is hard to move above 30 degrees, I'm hoping that will break in."
2,Poor sound quality,"I got several Membran 10-CD sets for 9.99$. Most of these are old mono recordings and I've been very happy with their quality. But this one is an exception - the sound quality of many tracks is very poor, showing hissing and distortions. Unless there is music here that you cannot get from somewhere else, you should avoid this set, even if you can get it very cheap. Keep an eye for other Membran collections though."
4,Another solid chapter in Bruce Jones' Hulk saga,"Collecting the five part storyarc, Hide in Plain Sight finds Carl Creel AKA The Absorbing Man with a new ability that allows him to jump in and out of peoples minds. This little technique proves handy considering he's trapped in an underground prison, and who just so happens to be in the middle of this? That's right, good 'ol Bruce Banner. Hide in Plain Sight ie yet another more than solid chapter scripted by Bruce Jones, undoubtadly the best writer of the Hulk since Peter David. The story is a bit of a sidebar to Jones' continuing conspiracy storyarc, but this is a welcome distraction. Leo Fernandez's art seems a bit cartoony for me, he doesn't give Hulk the gritty look that is done so superbly by Mike Deodato, but the art isn't bad by any means. All in all, Hide in Plain Sight is yet another more than solid chapter in Bruce Jones' excellent Hulk saga."
1,Very Disappointing,"After booking a holiday on Grand Cayman next year I was excited to watch the video to find out what to expect. I only managed to watch the first DVD as my life isn't long enough to have to sit through the photographs second disk. The content of the filming is that of a poor holiday video and shows nothing of what to expect when visiting, no tourist attractions or information on what the Grand Cayman Islands has to offer visitors - however it did show us a lot of detailed shots of iguanas. Definitely not worth spending alot on. Definitely not a tourist guide and I'm unsure who this DVD is aimed at."
1,What connectivity???,"Device is crappy. Cannot pick up any signal unless hub is practically next to it. Even then, the signal strength and link quality are irratic at best. Customer support for the device is nearly useless. In summation, the equipment is just a a hair above a mere child's toy -- nonfunctional and breaks down at the slightest movement. A must-not buy!"
1,plugged but won't play,"although the box says works with Windows98, mine has a problem ... win98 can't recognize the driver in the installation CD which is also the latest version at the trendware website.(note that maybe the product requires win98SE, but the package doesn't say so) I've posted a request for support at their message board and have not heard back within 24 hours. good price but isn't worth the aggravation so far. will update this if I get it working."
4,The Meaning In Make Up,"The Meaning In Make Up is more than a CD. It's the truthful story of life. ""Every day's another fake across the street"". The true meaning about life and the way people act just so others are satisfied."
5,a CD that is worth your money..,"If you're still debating whether you should buy this CD or not, well then, i think you should definitely buy it. My American Heart's music is original and not similar to any other band. If you've ever heard any of their earlier music, then you already know how driven and awesome this band is. Their new CD is certainly a change from their older music, but this is much better and they have taken it to the next level.These young adults are full of pure talent and they prove it through this album. From the dramatic intro/song..all the way to the climactic end of the CD, it makes you beg for more. With catchy guitar rhythms, deep bass melodies, unique vocals, and solid drum beats, this Debut LP will not leave you unsatisfied. The lyrics are full of raw emotion that you can feel. Even if you are not a fan of this genre, this CD and this band will change your ways."
3,"I like this name more then when they were ""No Way Out"" but...","I wish they didn't get mainstreem and start produceing this only half way decent music. It listenable, but not up to par with what they used to produce in the begining when they were No Way Out, and the early days of MAH.My faviort track on this cd is ""In Between"", but only because it is just ""Busses and Blogs"" from the Certainty Kills EP remade.and I also wish he didn't start getting vocal lessions cause I love how orginal his orginal voice was, before he got skilled.Overall it is deffantly a great buy but only if you have never heard there stuff before this album.-If you have heard there stuff before this album I suggest you borrow a friends and give it a quick listen before you make the desicion on makeing a purchase. If no one you know has it, sample the songs. PEACE!"
3,Excitingly Good,"If you're new to My American Heart, than you will find out that this debut album is like nothing you have ever heard. The Vocals are unique, the lyrics superb, and all the talent on the instruments is amazing. Coming from 5 guys who are all younger than 18, they deserve your attention. For those of you who know them, get this CD! It's great, not only are the new tracks really good but some older classics like the remake to ""Ruins"" are so highly improved on! You won't regret the purchase of this album unless you don't like asians (joke). In any case a great album from a great indie band and it probably deserves to be put on the radar. MAH 5 Stars all the way!"
5,MY AMERICAN HEART - THE MEANING IN MAKEUP,"Hey whats up everyone, my name is Brad and I listen to alot of (...).I stumbled upon My American Heart threw (...), I have been jamming to their music ever since.I bought the cd the first day it hit stores. I feel like I can relate to the music alot, and i study the lyrics alot.From Track 1-12 this cd is a classic in my mind. My favorites include, The Process, Dont Sleep, The Keys To My Organ,In Between, and Runaway.I love this Cd, and love the band.Keep making great music for the fans!!NOW BUY THE CD! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!"
5,Americana,"Great book on a vanishing life style in America... Met the author, great guy tells a wonderful story both in person and through his works."
2,disappointment,"I thought it had a lot of recipes in it, so I was kind of disappointed. I may donate it to a library or something."
3,too small,"The person I bought this for has a big head--lots of brains! The XL was still too small, but he kept it anyway. Should have a better size guide."
2,HOW IS ANIMALS BEING SHOT AND KILLED GOOD FOR CHILDREN?,"When I watched this video, I was suprised on how much violence this film shows! The back of the video sez it's educational for children? HA! You see a hunter shoot and kill a rabbit, a fox being shot, etc. How is violence going to help children learn anyway?"
2,Technocratic,"As a friend of Bill Johnson and a longtime racer and race fan, I looked forward to the book, but after 100 pages it was clear the technocratic writing style would not bring Maier's compelling recovery to much life. On the facts alone one feels deeply for Maier personally and respects his incredible rehab, but oft cited medical reports,training charts and plans, and media strategy do little to tell us how Maier personally coped with his losses and regained his form. Clearly Maier has great courage, on and off snow, but the book reduces him largely to a re-engineered man and athlete, rather than someone facing human and career death who by family,will,passion,faith and science recovers. That story is there, but barely. To be fair, the book seemed to be a function of Maier's stoicism, which is clear throughout the book. I think there is more to Maier than he was willing to tell."
1,The Race of My Life by Hermann Maier,"I was terribly disappointed with the 100 or so pages I forced myself to read. I had looked forward to reading about Maier's incredible courage and expected to be inspired as I was by Lance Armstrong's book. Maier's book fails to re-create the experience of the extraordinary event, and his miraculous return to competition. Hard to believe that a story such as this could be made tedious. It reads as though Maier dictated it into a computer program which translated and transcribed it. I also suspect they rushed it to print without the revisions it needed desperately. I found myself skimming pages, and I was shocked by how poorly the story is told and written. He is clearly the uber-athlete, but he should stay on the slopes and leave writing to the experts. Waste of time and money."
2,A little disappointed,"This book gave me insight into the competitive world of ski racing and I found it very informative. Maier's comeback from his horrible accident is indeed inspiring, but I found the book way too long and detailed to keep my interest from waning. I finished it, but it was tedious. A good editor and a little more flair could have made this a great book."
3,Amazing Comeback,"Herman's book can be subtitled ""Don't count me down and out just yet...."" And this is the recurring theme throughout.Perhaps it's the translation into English, but the Herminator comes across as not only a great athlete, but a little too self-centered! It's as everything revolves around his being and return to winning, no make that crushing his competitors and not just the race hill. You can almost ""see and hear"" the snorting, growling, grimacing in the start gate as you read this book - yet you don't really get a true feeling of what all this means to him other than competition, endorsements, and being the all conquering focus for the Austrians - not even his team mates. But somewhat like Bode Miller, Maier came from ""outside"" the alpine racing mainstream and perhaps that's why he appears to remain somewhat outside the norm.I read Bode's book at the same time and in the end, you sure know which guy you want to sit and have a beer with or ski a run with."
2,Disappointed,"Like the other reviewer I was really excited to get the book and get started. After the first 20 pages or so I thought it would pick up and get more personal. It however, dragged on as Maier described his injuries. He was not as humble as I thought many moments and I didn't find it as ""inspiring"" as I was hoping for. The writing is very bland and the book far too long for the story he presents. Some of the details are not important...I ended up skimming the last 1/2 of the book. It is an incredible comeback but this book is not so revealing."
3,Ya'll want a single?,"Not really, no. It's a very good song and Twisted Transistor is great too. But again . . . this is a single. Single's kinda suck . . . honestly if you ""need"" this song, the entire CD itself is mere pennies more than this. Plus, this gets two of the songs that saw the most radio airtime, and misses sevearl other great songs on it. In my opinion, Coming Undone isn't the best song on the CD anyway. I do agree with many people that the direction koRn has been taking is sorta . . . disappointing, but that's for another discussion. I wouldn't get this. Just get the CD."
1,Not as pictured,I was expecting a selection of colors as per the picture (a little mending kit so to speak) and I received one spool only of black thread. SO misleading!!!!!!
3,Solid and engaging read,"I read this book as part of a class I took on environmental chemistry. It is thorough and extensive in the subject matter it covers, and was not too difficult to read. Alas, I find the subject matter boring before reading this book, and left with my opinions unchanged."
4,Becoming a Yo-Yo Man,"Perfect for sharing with my 7 year old grandson. It doesn't have all the tricks I learned at that age, but most of them. Illustrations and text make them easy to comprehend for kids at both ends of the spectrum."
1,Very disappointing ... Just another general cookbook,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is very complete and nicely done, but seems to have little connection with its title -- which was what prompted me to buy it. There aren't many recipes that even won ribbons (and not all of them were even blue ribbons). I'd probably be very enthusiastic if this had had a general title, but IMHO, the title indicated that it would contain blue ribbon winners -- not 1% red or blue ribbon winners <sigh>."
3,There are a few errors,"I agree that the book is not a ""Bible"" of American cookery, but it does get shelf space in my kitchen. It's a workmanlike book of middle American cuisine. However, I've also found a few proofreading errors in the book, such as the ""Dream Bars"" recipe on p. 598 that calls for a cup of coconut and a cup of pecans, but never uses them in the text of the recipe. It later refers readers to a diagram on a page, but the page referent is wrong. I like to compare recipes when making anything for the first time, and always like to read the recipe thoroughly. Dream Bars is the reason why!"
5,A blast from my past,"What a great cookbook. My mother's family is from Nebraska and this book is like a view into my grandmother's kitchen. Wonderful, glorious Midwestern rib-sticking cooking. Remember, this is cooking for farmer's who worked from sun-up to sun-down and worked hard. Pie at breakfast and lots of fried food. So, go easy on the portions. Also, for those who think Midwestern cooking is bland, you need the sides. Those wondrous pickles and relishes. If you have the sides everything else falls into place and what might be considered a plain cuisine becomes nuanced. Complexity is not only achieved by sauces, but by pickles as well (because my great-grandmother was Amish we had the seven sweets and seven sours at big family dinners). Grab this book!"
4,Fun Read,This was a fun read and has a lot of interesting historical facts to understand better about why we are where we are today vis a via drugs.
3,Light and meandering,"The book is an easy read, but it doesn't really seem to have a point. It goes thru a lot of different drugs and a lot of historical snipets and you sort of feel like you a learning something, but in the end you get nothing. There does not seem to be enough depth about any one drug or any one aspect of the drug trade or any anything. It is not a bad book, but it is not a good one either. Certainly not great."
2,Disappointing -- for an O'Reilly title,"This book is long on the classical Unix-of-yore (awk, sed, five different shells) but short on really useful 'hard' Linux stuff. Many configuration commands, networking, etc are missing. There's a big overlap with my five-year-old Unix V reference, also published by O'Reilly.Similarly, I think the large Perl section is misplaced in a Linux reference book. If you need this level of detail, you get one of the camel books.Also, the index leaves something to be desired -- and that's a big minus for a pure reference book like this. Indeed, as some other reviewers have noted, once you know which command to use, man pages will in many cases be just as convenient."
4,Not what I expected,"I get dissapointed. I expected a lot more about the ""core"" or the ""kernel"" of linux, but the book is 80-90 % of the concepts are just what you find in any unix (Some of the chapters are: perl, vi, patterns, shells..). Is good if you want to have a basic overview of unix based on linux. That's all.Me decepcionó. Esperaba un poco más del núcleo o del ""alma"" de linux, pero el libro en un 80-90% trata de los conceptos generales de cualquier unix. (Imagínese: Algunos de los capítulos son sobre vi, perl, el uso de patrones, etc.). Es bueno si lo que uno desea es una visión general de unix, tomando como base linux. ...y ya."
2,Not as good as expected !,"This book does not impress me as much as it should mainly because it does not carry much details about each of the commands, like defining what some words stand for.Maybe I had hoped that it will be something like the DOS6Running Start ISBN of 981-214-445-5 which is a superb book that has examples for each and everyone of the command unlike this nutshell one.All in all, the book fails to express out the OS fully which Linus had created."
1,very bad,Don't buy this book for starters of Linux. It contains a lot of information but little to help you start out with Linux. Crucial stuff like X windows are left out completely and who doesn't know that X windows is one of the many pains in Linux. But the greatest worry for buyers of this book is that Linux kernel 2.2 is coming out soon and will render a lot of the stuff here redundant.
3,Useful but somewhat flawed.,"The list of Linux commands is the most useful part of the book. It can be a lifesaver at times, but problems sometimes creep in, namely incomplete or erroneous information. Command line switches, such as those for adduser are either incorrect or missing. This could be because it was written for a version of Linux other than Red Hat 6.0. In any case, this caused problems for me in configuring systems.Also, explanations could have been clearer.Still, it was a useful addition to my Linux library."
4,A good buy,"Great for quick reference. Little on GUIs, but no GUI is really standard. Good stuff on PERL and shell scripts. Helpful to the somewhat Linux experienced, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who's just started."
2,Its nice to have....,"I'm a descendant of James Boisseau and really just purchased it as part of family history, its nice to have. It is not a very thick book at all, quarter of an inch thick really, I would recommend it for historical reasons anway."
4,Wonderful,I love this book! As a new gardener and one who's primarily focused onveggies and herbs it's the perfect book for me. I love the photos and descriptions that are provided. I originally borrowed this book from the library and had to have my own copy!
4,Different Way of Gardening,The book will help new gardners or those who are trying container gardening for the first time.
4,Good book for container gardening,"I gave it 4 stars because I couldn't find much information about diseases/pests for vegetables in it. Otherwise, good book!"
5,The Best Book for Self-Watering Containers,"This is an extremely thorough and well-thought-out book. This book tells you about the veggies and herbs that work well in self-watering containers, as well as providing the same level of planting advice for veggies and herbs that should be planted in traditional containers. This has been a great addition to my library."
2,Very Average,"This book starts out good and states that it's going to tell you how to make your own self-watering containers. However, once you get through all the initial fluff, I found the details necessary to actually follow through on the author's suggestions to be extremely limited. The author discusses how to make any pot self-watering, but uses a ready made insert. Then he does not say where to get the ready made insert from. Parts of the book read more like a pat on the back to his own successes with pictures from his own garden. That's great, but I bought the book to learn how to set up my own self-watering system which I still am at a loss after reading the book. I was very disappointed."
2,Not as good as Vegetable Gardener's Bible or Bountiful Container,"I learned a great deal from Edward Smith's other book, The Vegetable Gardener's Bible, and I use it as a reference on germination and growing soil temperatures. So I did not hesitate to order his Incredible Vegetables from Self-Watering Containers when I decided to buy some books on container gardening. I ordered this book and McGee and Stuckey's Bountiful Container. Bountiful Container is comprehensive, thoughtful and very helpful. However, this book reads like an ad for self-watering containers, which were apparently provided free to the author with the hope that he might endorse them. Unlike the author's first book, this lavishly illustrated book is short on information, more suitable for a coffee table than a container gardener. If there were a money-back guarantee, I would request it."
3,Didn't live up to my expectations,"This book claimed that you could ""even make your own homemade"" self-watering containers. I bought it to find directions to do so. However, the book does not contain any directions for making our own. This was quite disappointing. It did have colorful individual growing instructions for veggies, and Ed's container gardening method is an improvement over putting veggies in regular pots, but for the experienced gardener the ""amazing POTS system"" has very little new information. I gave mine away as a gift to someone I thought could benefit from it."
1,Don't waste your money on this book.,"If you're into gardening at all, you already know the stuff in this book. It's one big advertisement for Earth Boxes and the like."
1,braindead default configuration,"Once configured, the thing seems to work Ok. Getting there, though is a nightmare.First thing to note: If you use Linux, DO NOT BUY THIS THING. It ships with the AppleTalk, SNMP, Netware protocols enabled, BUT NOT TCP/IP. To make matters worse, the built-in web-admin tool does not allow you to change settings - just see what they are.If, however, you choose to ignore the warnings above, here is how to make it work:1) Install Wine2) Connect the ethernet cable to printserver3) Insert the CD4) Browse to the 'manualinstallation' folder5) Type 'wine Setup.exe'-This will install the printer manager software into your 'fake windows' directory6) Run the printer manager using WineMore pain than it needed to be, yet not more painful than expected...."
5,Indispensable,"This book is a must read for anyone involved in the ever-changing world of technology. Reading this book provided an amazing plain-english understanding of all issues surrounding network security especially as they relate to my businesses and my clients. As an attorney, this book gave me the ability to understand the language my clients speak and to relate to the specific needs of their different businesses - especially in light of today's regulatory environment (i.e. Health care, Securities, etc). It has also proven to be an essential tool for my own IT department regarding our own issues when dealing with sensitive and confidential client information."
5,AN AWESOME FIND!,"As hard as it is to find littlest pet shop figures anywhere, i'm glad i found these....my grandchildren love them.... and this set is so cute. The bobble-heads just top the toy. It's something cute and fun and not violnt for kids to love, boys and girls alike."
2,You Have Got To Be Kidding...!!!,"O.K., I'm a Mr. Budd fan....but I try & stay away from early to mid '90's ambient recording since they are usually overblown synthesizer Yanni type productions ( ie...early Patrick O'Hearn) but since I saw the *GREAT* reviews concerning this particular compositions I figured I'd bite....Well...talk about a Jon & Vangelis rip off..even down to the Jon Anderson type vocals & echoing electronic piano!!! I'm glad Mr. Budd progressed beyond the point of copying the early pioneers of ambient/space/TD type music. This early work is nothing more than that! Not that it's bad.....it rates a C-. But is REALLY DATED! Just be aware! It's is like purchasing the Beach Boys ""Surfin' USA"" album after hearing ""Pet Sounds."""
3,BT Accessory,"Was helpful, but could have been shaped better to not cause the talk button of the headset to be pressed so easily."
1,Not feasible,"I got this product so I wouldn't have to wear my bluetooth all the time. However, when you put the piece in the case and either bump it or bend over it activates the bluetooth and calls the last person dialed. After doing this several times I have taken the case off and not used it.This case will only work if you have a bluetooth that you can easily turn on/off. The Motorola H350 is not one of them."
3,Case your headset,"This is a good case for your headset, but I wish they hadn't made it so bubbly (the case is too wide) I didn't know it would be so big when I received it. The belt clip is good, they should've had a removable clip so you can store it in your pocket."
2,nice and useless,"There have been many times where I needed to stow my headset for one reason or another, only to have the magical does-everything button get mashed, turning the thing on and calling the last person I talkd to. I bought this pouch in hopes that it would prevent this, but it only does so if clipped to my belt. The pouch isn't completely rigid, so if I stuff it into a pocket or bag, the button on the headset can still get mashed. The pouch is small, and the clip is short, so it seems liable to get bumped off of my belt and lost, prompting me to want to stuff it into a pocket anyway. This is a well-made product, even if it isn't well-engineered. It would have been perfect if it were rigid enough to protect the button, but as it is it's largely useless."
4,Bluetooth headset carrying case,This is a real handy thing to have. I used to keep my bluetooth in my desk at work. Now I feel better it is with me. Easy to take out and a nice clip that is snug and won't come of your belt easily. The only thing I was concerned about in the beginning was that it would turn on the pairing button because it was snug at first. No longer does it do this...
3,Bluetooth headset carrying case,"Nice little pouch, however if you bend or twist the headset has a tendency to slid up out of it. Mine did not come with the strap over the top to hold the headset in."
3,MOTOROLA BLT-04 BLUETOOTH HEADSET CARRYING CASE,"SKIMPY IN SIZE, NARROW AND DOES NOT FIT THE MODEL WITH EXTENSION. ON/OFF BUTTON TURNS ON VERY EASY."
4,Motorola Bluetooth Headset Case,"A very nice case and well worth the money. But, as some of the other reviews have stated, it you use the strap to secure the headset in the case you will more than likely hit the ""ON"" button and activate the headset draining your battery. I have had success by cutting off the strap, allowing the headset to merely sit in the case.....Also makes it easier to remove from the case. Be careful not to press on the case or it will turn on the headset."
2,snap crackle and pop (off),"I have gone through three HS850 Motorola headsets. After the first one expired--largely due to the inability to recharge, brought on by exposure to pockets, etc.--I bought two BLT-04 cases to take care of the replacement headset I got. At first, the case seemed to be a godsend. It fit perfectly and clipped on effortlessly. Then I realized that it also clipped off just as effortlessly. I figured I'd be careful enough and kept the case. While packing boxes for moving, I did not notice that clip slipped off and fell into one of the boxes along with the headset. By the time I realized what happened, all the boxes were packed, sealed and ready to go to storage. It's not as bad as losing the set on a street, but, still, I am unable to use it until boxes get unpacked. Luckily, the price dripped from $80+ for the headset to around $30 and I did not hesitate to get a replacement. But I am not putting it into the case--it's safer in my pocket."
1,Did the Guy Who Designed This Test It?,"Like everyone else, I bought this for my Motorola H700--the item this was supposedly designed for. Really? Did anyone at Motorola test it before they started selling it? The fit is great, until you realize that just by putting your Bluetooth headset into the case, you have turned it on to Pairing mode--real drag on the battery. This should have been a hard case. Oh well, the search continues..."
1,presses the headset button!,"This case is worthless with my Motorola HS815 headset. Every time I put the headset in the case, the case squeezes the activation button on the headset. Maybe it will work with headsets that do not have the activation button on the outside surface."
2,Carrying Case,I am stuck with a lemon on this one. It doesn't stay closed and it is so flimsy that the bluetooth gets turned on in my purse.
1,terrible case,I lost a $60 earpiece because of this case. The lip has velco that can easily catch on a shirt and be opened. The earpiece does not sit snug so it can easily fall out when the lip is open. would not recommend this case.
4,Almost perfect,"Inexpensive, lightweight, protects the headset from my other junk - a great deal. It is a teeny bit skimpy - a bit of the earpiece sticks out - but on the whole satisfactory."
3,Motorola Headpiece Case,"This case clips onto my belt quite easily, but tends to fall off at times and because it has no strap across the top and is a little large for my headpiece, the Motorola H700, the headpiece tends to fall out of the case at times. Unfortunately, I don't always notice when the case has fallen off my belt or the headpiece has slipped out of the case. Fortunately, I haven't, yet, permanently lost either. Otherwise, the product is satisfactory."
5,Cool Little Holder,"I either lose headset's or break them by sitting, dropping, and/or various other ways of destruction. The cool thing this carrying case is now I have 1 place, a SPECIAL place, to put my head set. If you use a headset, I highly recommend you get one of these.It was a good value for the price and I received it much faster than I expected it to arrive."
5,Bluetooth Saver!,"I lost my previous bluetooth to an auto-accident (yes, it was run over and ended in many pieces!) - all because I dropped it from my pocket! This carrying case clips on my purse securely (or my pocket) so I no longer slip my bluetooth in jeans pockets and then end up fumbling to get it out (which is how I dropped it over a deck to the road). Great product at a very reasonable price!"
1,Don't buy this case.,"The major issue I've had with this case is that it fits the headset so snugly that it pushes the button and activates the headset, which runs down the battery. Ironically, I bought the case to prevent the headset from being accidentally activated. I can't imagine why Motorola would produce a case with such an obvious defect. Apparently no one on the design team actually tried the case out with the headset. Since the sides of the case are elastic, I'm hoping maybe it will stretch over time."
1,Terrible case for the H500,"Ordered from Amazon for use with Motorola H500. The case is not rigid and when compressed under normal usage, the case pushes directly on the button of the H500 (causing redial). Also, the velcro strap is very flimsy. Recommend that you look for another case for the H500."
3,Bluetooth heaset case,I find myself not realy using this case. As soon as I take my ear piece off I just throw it in my purse or glove box.
4,It's a must have....,"I have had the bluetooth headsets before, this was the first one that I purchased a carrying case for.... It's a must have item if you are going to carry your headset with you and not have it in use all of the time. The carry case prevents any ""accidental"" phone calls. In the past I've dropped the headset in my purse, the buttons got pushed with looking for other items, with this carrying case, those phone calls are eliminated.I love it."
5,Motorola BLT-04 Bluetooth Headset Carrying Case,Works great. Help protect the Bluetooth while not in use. Practical case.
5,Nice set.,"Great product. Love the carrying case. Plus side, it always correspondes with all my Motorola phones. A keeper for sure."
2,The Case of the Weak Closure,"It is definitely an item that is needed, but the design flaw of the Velcro closure is very weak. It ends-up being a holder with a very poorly designed mechanism to close and secure the Bluetooth headset. Also, over priced when you add the shipping charge. You would think that the designers of the Bluetooth would be capable of doing a better job with this carrying case. I DO NOT recommend this item."
2,needs some work,"lost my headset out of the case,velcro is not good at all.case will not stay closed,but the case itself is great."
2,Case not as I wanted,"I purchased the carrying case to be able to carry my Motorola headset in my purse since I don't use it frequently. Sad to say it does not work well for that! When the headset is pressed against something it will turn on by itself == not good! However, it does work ok outside the purse; that is attached to the outside of the purse. The case is some protection to just having the headset laying around. I know it was quite inexpensive but I did expect more out of it."
4,keeps it from being lost,gets the job done. holder keeps the hands free from being lost. the velcro feels flimsy.
2,"Good Case, Needs a Few Improvements","I'm using an 850. This is a quality case, but it could use some improvements.The strap is too short; when strapped it causes the case to squeeze against the headset - turning it on. (Even when the mouthpeice is closed, in the off position.) I will probably cut a small piece of double sided velcro to fix the problem.The sides are made of elastic, they should drop the elastic and make the whole case using the front and back synthetic material. Essentially making a molded case.If I lost it, not finding a comparable molded case - I would buy another one."
1,Good looks but bad design.,"When I purchased this item for my Bluetooth it appeared from the pictures on the website that it would work well but, that was not to be. The appearance of the case is nice but, when it comes to design and functionability this is where the designers got it all wrong. The case/cover does not allow enough space for the bluetooth unit to fit inside the case/cover properly without the case/cover squashing the bluetooth unit and turning on the programming power button and keeping it on. If the case was an extra 1/8""-1/4"" deeper this would prevent this from happening. I even tried using the case/cover without the elastic strap that is supposed to keep the bluetooth unit inside and still the problem occured. As for looks the unit is great but, I didnt buy it for the looks. I bought it to keep an expensive bluetooth unit safe and now the case/cover just collects dust!"
1,Openings is to large for small bluetooth.,I lost my bluetooth twice from that case. Openings is to large for small bluetooth.
1,Not a good buy.,The case sets the bluetooth off with-out warning and the belt clip is not strong enough to hold on the belt.
5,"buy it, since it is useful.",I never used my blue tooth ear piece since it is inconvenient to be carried if you don't make a call...........now problem solved.........stongly recommended
2,Promotes premature turnons,"I'm not very happy with this case. When I put my headset in it and then accidentally lean against something, my headset gets turned on. The way the case was designed, it puts potential pressure right on the on/off button."
1,piece of junk,"Hits the buttons when its in the case!!!! on and off ,or make that call you where un aware of."
3,Mike in Antelope,"I have been looking for a carrying case for my wife's bluetooth headset for close to a year ! The Motorola BLT-04 carrying case is the only one I have seen . No stores even offer an item like this ! So, I purchased 2 of them . One for me & one for my wife . I like it because it makes it easy to store and carry my headset . It also fits on my belt or on my wifes purse . It's not particularly attractive but gets the job done . My only complaint is that it pushes on the call button & causes my headset to light up momentarily each time you secure the strap . So far it doen't seem to affect the battery life . I think it works well for my H700 & HS850 but the H500 might have problems turning on by accident .This has been a problem for us with the H500 with out a carrying case .I have not been able to confirm this yet. So I can't say for sure.It's a good carrying case but could use a little more space away from the call button.Mike."
5,Bluetooth holder,Convenient and easy container for bluetooth - means it isn't always getting switched on and the earpiece won't get snagged on something in the bottom of my bag. Neat thing. Thanks!
1,don't waste your money,"bought this and hated it. wasn't worth the postage to even return it. The clip to hold it on your waist or belt is terrible, doesn't stay in place. The velcro closure on the top/front is cheap and small. Not well made. I expected better from a Motorola product. This one was a total disppointment."
3,met expectations,It was as advertised. Not sure there really is a good way to carry these little things'
1,Practically Useless,"Comment: I am disappointed with this case.Purchase Reason: I was looking for headset protection and prevention from scratch or marks. Was also looking for prevention of accidental calls (buttons protection). Was looking for a carrier that fits well.Pros: Fits my headset Motorola H500. Allows headset to be clipped onto a belt.Con: Call button on headset fits right onto the seam area where it protrudes so when in my pocket it makes random calls to the last person I spoke with. (really annoying). Like reviews said Velcro area is not large enough for proper closure. I don't think this case gives any protection, bluetooth can still be crushed with this as well as scratched. Price was not really cheap either. *I do not recommend this case for anyone unless you are ONLY expecting a bluetooth carrier for your belt*"
1,functional but REALLY chincy,"Holds the headset, but the strap is really flimsy and too long, and the whole thing is cheaply and badly made."
4,very convenient,"if it's not on my ear it's in this case or on the charger. sometimes it slips out, but i just have to check it from time to time. keeps the shiny coating on my motorola earpiece scratch free from not being bumped by things in my pockets."
3,Wish I had read the reviews before purchase,"This is a good idea that needs tweaking.My Motorola H700 fits in - but like the other reviewers, it doesn't protect the button from being pushed.I also couldn't get it to stay in the pouch, until I slid the earpiece in first and twisted it to go through the bottom elastic and back up the outside of the case. it's the only thing to keep it from falling out.If that was the intent, instructions would have been helpful. I got such a good deal on it that it cost more to return it than it was worth."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this item. I bought it b/c I lost my last bluetooth. It does have a clip, which is what I wanted. It does Not have a closure on the top so my new bluetooth kept falling out. I did get in touch with customer service and they said the new style will have a top closure...wait for the new style."
3,is not to good,the product is not to goodi think there will be other case in the market to protect your bluetooth
3,Works great but no strap,"I am using this with a HS850 and it fits perfectly. The case itself is very rigid and much higher quality than I had expected. I don't regularly wear this on my belt, rather, I just use it to protect the headset when I toss it in the glove box or in a coat pocket. For my needs it works excellent and I'd rate it 5 stars for my application. The case does not have the strap as shown in the picture. The headset is secured in place by groves in the case but this is not a guarantee that it will not fall out if bumped or turned upside down. If you're looking to sport this thing on your belt full-time you'd be better off getting a case that actually has a strap to secure the headset in place (like the one shown in the picture). For this reason I gave this an overall rating of 3 stars."
4,Hands Free Carrying Case,"I have a H721 Motorola bluetooth device. Even though I could not really find many references to this device when I searched for a carrying case, I took a chance and purchased this one. I am very happy with the purchase. The device fits inside without a struggle to get it in or get it out of the case. So far, I haven't had any problems with it accidentally turning on as referenced in other research I saw on carrying cases. The only slight downside is that the velcro strap isn't as strong as I would prefer, but it doesn't appear that the headset will slide out easily anyway."
4,Pretty good unit,"The product is VERY handy!! It clips onto almost anything and holds the earpiece VERY nicely. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it has a tendency to jump off my belt at times. The clip is not what it could be but overall, I like it rather than keeping it on my ear or shoving it someplace on my person. For the price, you can't beat it!! Hope this helps!!!"
4,Great for your BT headset,IF you can get it for less than $5 with shipping. We each got one and use it with our H700's and haven't had the issues others have mentioned. Good protection for your BT headset!
3,Too small,"It's a cute little case, but it was too small for my bluetooth. It was made from top quality materials and is a good product and well worth the price."
2,it's...,"the carrying case is ok. it serves as a holder for my bluetooth. however, when i put this case with the bluetooth in my purse, it continuously turns on the bluetooth and dials the last number i called!! i know of this because the person that it dialed was with me that time and it did it several times. so i guess when you use this, you have to be careful!"
3,"does hold headset well, don't know if it's pressing the button","This carrying case does an excellent job of holding the headset, but the entire point of me getting it was to avoid having the big ""call someone"" button get pressed while the headset is loose in my pocket. I was using this at work yesterday and one of my old highschool buddies called me saying ""did you just call me?""...I don't know if it's because the headset's button got pressed despite being in the case, or if the smaller speakerphone button on my cellphone itself got pressed while the phone was loose in my pocket."
4,Motorola BLT-04 Bluetooth Headset Carrying Case,"Headset fits in the case nice and snug. Pleased with it overall. Clip seems a little cheesy, but I haven't had it long enough to test out it's quality."
4,Case for everything,"I got this free when I bought the bluetooth, but am glad I got it. I think it's good to have so you don't lose your earpiece and it protects as well when transporting & not on your ear. If you spend a lot of $ on a bluetooth, then spend a couple more bucks & protect it."
3,Looks good but...,"...it tends to be too tight on the on/off button, which causes inadvertent turn-ons and offs."
1,Headset case is poorly designed,Case is not useable. The side presses against the function button and turns the phone on. Couldn't adjust so it went to the trash.
1,"If you are putting a Motorola Bluetooth headset in this case, beware!","Bought mine from Eforcity via Amazon. Thought I would be happy because:A. Made by Motorola, and I was using it for a Motorola headset - what could be better?B. It looked kind of like something Batman would wear on his utility belt - so wouldn't I be the cool dude!When I ordered it, the photo showed it having a velcro strap across the top that retains the headset in the case.The case I ended up with is like the photo here and does not have a retaining strap.My Motorola H-850 headset will not stay in the case, which pretty much defeats the purpose of having a case for it in the first place.It was like pulling teeth to arrange for a refund, so my advice is:1. Don't buy form Eforcity2. No matter who you buy from, make sure you are getting the case that works.P.S. I had to give this turkey a star in order to post this review. Given the choice, I would not give it any positive rating at all."
4,Works For Me,"Good luck finding these offline... Maybe I'll start selling them myself.I ordered one a while back, when the price was still arnound $10.00 or so. The only flaw is that it comes with a thin flimsy velcro strap that will eventually wear out if you are active in life at all while wearing it on your hip.So, I gave $5.00 to a guy that works with leather to add a wider strap with a snap and it's just... Beautiful!So, when my lovely wife lost hers (Along with the Bluetooth Earpiece she kept in it), I came back to Amazon, saw that the price had dropped waaaay down and I got 5 of em. One for the wife, one for my dad, 3 more for whenever/whatever I might need em'.Trust me, this is ultimately worth having. While I know second-hand that you can lose the case, you're more likely to lose or even damage the bluetooth earpiece without a case... And the few bluetooth cases that you actually can find in the stores are just freakin' ugly as crap anyway."
2,Consider an alternative,"Given all the complaints about this case's design and how it inadvertently presses buttons, consider the Motorola Leather Bluetooth Headset Carry Holster instead. SYN1572A. List $14.99. (Found at the hellomoto website.)It's designed to lash around the headset's ear hook and leaves the rest of the headset dangling underneath the leather clip/loop - no pressure points on any of the buttons.Blurb:Simple modular design offers several options for easy access to Bluetooth headsets. The ability to wear on a belt, pocket, purse, arm, and neck accommodates many lifestyles.* Compact unique design* Magnetic closure allows easy access and secure retention of headset* Modular clip attaches to belt, purse, shirt pocket, armband, lanyard* Works with most Bluetooth headsets"
1,Dissapointing with H700,"Like other reviewers, I had problems using this case with the H700. It alternately put it into pairing mode, or worse, cause the H700 to redial the last number called. During one morning commute, I made 23 calls to my wife and filled her voicemail up with sounds from my radio. Imagine if I had been with my mistress!"
1,I Agree With the Others - A TOTAL Waste of Money!,"This case is a waste of money if you are buying it for use with the H700. The description for this item calls out the H700 as one of the compatible headsets, but that is so far from the truth. Yes, the headset fits into the case, but as all of us that were tricked into buying this and wasting our money have discovered, it turns out to be totally useless, as it keeps the headset button pressed in, placing the headset into ""discover"" mode. I threw this on my shelf and forgot about it until I was asked to write this review. Bad move, Motorola! I also would rate it ZERO (or even Negative) if the system would allow it. Don't you be tricked into wasting your hard earned $$$ ! ! ! ! !Motorola BLT-04 Bluetooth Headset Carrying Case"
4,Bob Bondurant on Race Kart Driving,I recently started racing go-karts and wanted to buy a book with some racing secrets and of course tips on proper racing techniques etc. I found that I knew most of want the book had to offer. In other words I did not find the book helpful to me in improving my racing skills. I felt that this book would benefit a first time rider someone starting out with 3 to 6 months or some one that just does not have the competitive edge due to lack of racing techniques and skills. I did think it was easy to read and explained racing techniques very well. I wish I had red this book a year ago. I learned these techniques the hard way (trial and error). I was able to read the entire book with in 2 hours and it was easy to refer back to curtain techniques that I wanted to share or simply read again. This is a great book for some one new to racing.
4,You should have it.,"Well, I do have some experience in karting and thought that it will be very difficult to find out something new. But from that book I've learned at least a few new tricks. Don't think that I could have reached them by my self. But still there is a sense of some mention failure (as if the author leaves something for him self or just want you to learn the most important thing only)."
5,Examine how you think about software development,"Why is software development so often plagued by crisis? Weinberg helps the reader step back from developing software and examine the dynamics and patterns of software creation. By discussing patterns of quality, patterns of managing and patterns of software faults, the author shows that quality software begins with keen observation and clear thinking about software development. The text is extremely thought-provoking and is spiced with anecdotes drawn from decades of software experience. When my software team considered the book in a study group last year, our insight into our efforts and understanding of each other took a leap upward. Highly recommended"
3,Good not great,"I guess I under-estimated how much I already knew. It isn't that the book is not good, it just didn't give me much that I didn't already know."
3,Mediocre,"While I generally like Weinberg's more humanistic take on managing software, sometimes I feel like his lack of rigor is a detriment. His strategies and ideas are all well and I good, I agree with them completely, but his models are often too vague and he usually doesn't provide the beleaguered manager with much to go on besides platitudes. Overall I would say there isn't much (if any) new information in this book. Of course, I guess that depends on what other books you have read prior to this :-)"
4,Avg size only,"Not for a bigger size person the material is on point but the face does look a little goofy, but its a good costume"
3,"Looks Great, fits poorly","The costume looks great, the fit however is poor. The inseam was to tight and ended up ripping 1/2 way through the night."
2,"Too small for anyone 5'10"" or taller","I was very excited for this costume. The price was GREAT!I waited in anticipation, and when it arrived, I immediately undressed and donned my outfit. Terror ensued as it was Oct. 29 and this costume didn't even hit my calves. I've never had such a wedgie and the head made it almost impossible to look anywhere but straight.The costume was made well, and looked great, but it is definitely NOT one size fits all."
4,Great Costume for Shorties,Cute costume - got lots of great compliments.Warning: I am 5'4 - I can't imagine anyone taller than 5'7 or 5'8 fitting in this costume. We actually bought it for my boyfriend but he couldn't fit it but its fun for me! :)
4,It will get the job done.,"I'm 6'1"" and 180 pounds and this barely got the job done. If you're any bigger at all, don't order it. The sleeves were way too short for me. I also ended up cutting the hands off. By the end of the night the back (were the spot is sewed) had ripped. I would be a little more upset about it, but it's a costume I'll trash after tonight."
3,Tight,"Kids loved me wearing it at work, but was too tight in the crotch.I am a 5' 9"" person, not exactly too tall but it was tight.So be aware before you buy it."
4,music fan,"Check out this band! The Porcelain Productions label out of Richmond,Va. is putting out the best music these days and this is yet another jewel in their crown.Fast, tight and a drummer that kicks with a rightous fury.If you like your rock with the beef to back it up,order this cd. My favorite new label and band."
4,Good buy at $50,"Bought these on a 1/2 price sale. The best looking $50 shoe I've ever bought. The sizing is accurate, and the finish is good.However, they are not worth the suggested retail of $100. The quarter lining is non breathable plastic that gets hot, the composite soles generate static electricity as you walk, and the sides cut into my ankle (less so now that they are broken in)."
3,Nick'swife,Bought this for Halloween costume for 5 yr. old. Hat was too small and you could barely make out the sounds on the walkie-talkie - my son seem disappointed with that. Liked the watch and the pocket in the vest. A bit over-priced.
1,this should get 0 stars,this is the worst xbox game! its not even fit to be put in a hole and buried! how could microsoft let this sucky game be relesed for the xbox? who knows...
1,A Game with Flat Tires,"The models constantly jerk, and the levels look bland. The game never even attempts to hook the player into playing. There is a poor mixture of music and sound effects, and there is absolutely no game design at all."
1,Worst. Game. Ever.,"This game is the worst game I have personally ever played. It has bland graphics, horrible music and laughable game play! The Offical Xbox Magazine has rated this...the worst game ever. This game isn't even worth the money, time, or even breath asking to buy this game. Please avoid at all costs!"
1,The Worst Game Have Ever Played.,"I bought this game because it is notorious for being absolutely awful. And is it ever. The developers of this game might as well be giving you a paper cut and pouring lemon juice on it. It's that bad. If you go to fast, keep in mind this is a racing game, your driver will have a heart attack and stall your vehicle. Just plain bad from graphics and gameplay all the way to the horrible cover art."
4,Zip the Cat,"One of the original cats and getting hard to find now. Not for rough kids. Great for any cat lover or Beanie Baby collector. Also, if you like the smaller McDonalds version, you'll like the bigger version."
5,Fun!,"This is my favorite stuffed animal. It's so cute! I used to play with mine all the time when I was little. It is definitely hard to ruin! Mine has been through a lot, being dragged through sand boxes, going in the washing machine, even being buried!"
1,Stay away from this p.o.s.,"I bought this mouse for the geek factor of having a fan built into it to cool off my hand. Not terribly practical, but a neat little touch. At $15, the price certainly seemed right. There is a major problem I've had with this mouse, though, and after a little bit of forum searching I've found that I'm not the only one. Now and then, seemingly at random, the mouse will stop responding and I'll have to unplug it and then replug it back into the USB port to get it working again. Not exactly convenient when I'm in the middle of a round of UT2004 or Battlefield 1942. I would recommend staying away from this cheapo mouse and spending the extra cash to get something sturdy and dependable from Logitech or Microsoft."
2,"Poorly written, incorrect conclusions, and just overly confusing","As a student of science and someone who does research in the animal behavior field I had to comment. The author makes a pale attempt at writing a book both for a scientific and a layman audience. It was a good effort, but the amount of oversimplifications and just incorrect information makes this book a waste of time. It is rife with spelling mistakes and a lot of the text is fill"
2,But I'm not a scientist . . .,"I got this book because I'm a dog behavior consultand and am very interested in wild canines as well. The book was more than a bit disappointing. It reads like a science text book and although school was fun when I was there I really don't need my pleasure reading to feel like studying. I would have prefered something more readable - not bad to fall asleep to though. However, the biggest problem I had with it was that too much of detialed other animal species. I bought the book to learn canine social behavior and the book goes into everything from birds to deer. All in all it was nothting like I expected. I still gave it 2 stars for the people who want a textbook. For them this might be perfect. I think the typical amazon shopper will give up half way through this short book."
1,Don't Order From This Person!,"It took forever to receive & they sent Cinderella, I obviously ordered Peter Pan- they never responded to my emails or fixed the issue- HORRIBLE SERVICE, if you can even call it that!"
4,"An all round excellent game, but there are still issues...","I thought Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine was probably the best Action game i've ever played. The graphics are amazing, very clear, and the pure sense of adventure in this game are awesome. I enjoyed the gameplay and storyline, but there are a couple of issues that need to be resolved with the game. There is a nasty glitch in the game that will keep you from proceeding to one level to the next, and another problem in which a key will not work on a gate even though you have it with you. Fortunetly lucasarts has released a patch, downloading it helped. Even with these minor glitches, Indiana Jones an the Infernal Machine still remains a strong action game."
5,Very cool game,"If you're an Indiana Jones fan, there's no question; you're going to love this game.Excellent, with a story that, unlike many other games, makes sense and makes you care about it.I don't find this game so difficult as some people say it is. You just have to think like good old Dr. Jones in order to solve the puzzles and beat the bad guys."
3,Better than i thought...,"I was put off this game initially by people saying 'it was to much like tomb raider.' I don't actually like tomb raider but i went out and bought this game anyway. With the light out and some practise with the controls, this game becomes quite scary.. Glowing skeletons and snakes that bight, gave me a real fright.. It has excellent graphics and sounds like waterfalls etc.. All its custom controls like turning on hints and setting difficulty are helpful.. Finally it is nothing like tomb raider, it is an indiana jones with a style of its own.."
4,A solid game which kept me playing for hours,Well I just recently completed this game and I must say I was very pleased. I have a short attention span and hate to get hung up on a part of a game which I can't get around witout cheating. This game while sometime difficult kept the puzzles easy enough for me to keep playing. I had never played a tomb raider game either so I didn't have a lot of knowledge of such games. The levels were laid out nicely and the graphics were good enough to make a couple screenshots worth while. I can only say this is a must have for any Indy fan and a good buy for a true gamer.
1,Major-league disappointment,"More than any other game released this year, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine was a thorough let-down for me. Indy moves as if he's walking in a molassses swamp, the controls are awful, and all the game amounts to is a weak Tomb Raider clone. This one is likely to hit the bargain-bins fast. LucasArts really messed up on this one. If you want a Tomb Raider game (which this tries desperately to be, yet only achieves in a very lackadaisical manner) stick with the best: Eidos games and Ms. Lara Croft."
5,I am certainly amazed!,"I just finished playing Lucasart's latest Indiana Jones thriller, and I am certainly amazed by it! I find it hard to believe that this excellent game has gotten so many poor reviews. Come on people! Don't we buy computer games (especially when they're run offs of our favorite movies) to try and journey into another world? Isn't that exactly what Indy and the Infernal Machine does? It great gaming at its best!The only draw backs to the game were a few errors, such as appearing in a new level without any of your items (which include some Infernal Machine parts which are critical to getting through most levels.) Aside from that, the game is very good.So whether you're dashing along a beach on a tropical island in the Philippines, busting commies at 75 miles per hour, blasted your way off a Soviet ship, or hiking through snowy mountains, you'll find every level in this game to be excellent!So.....what are you waiting for? Buy it!"
4,indy pushes on,"This is a great follow up to Fate of Atlantis, and it's nice to see Indy jumped into 3D. The textures are really nice, and it carries a lot of Typical Indy puzzles. Sure it looks a lot like Tomb Raider, but you know Indy was there first. This game needs to be ported to PS. The only downfall is theat the programming is a little tempermental in Win2000, but then again, what isn't? Plus there are patches for this game. this is worth the buy. You won't be disappointed."
2,Did they change this game or what!,"I was extremely disapointed when I started playing this game. I love the Indiana Jones series, but this is a totally different game! You hardly encounter any people you can talk to. Is more of a game to explore and watch and fight. Boring! And I hated the graphics."
3,Not Great,"This is not what I expected. After finishing ""No One Lives Forever"" and ""Half-Life,"" I picked this game up. I was majorly let down. Making Indy move around is tiresome. Having to hold the shift key to make him run really stinks. I tried making him move off the mouse, but all he did was spin around in circles. Anyway, tough to get around. Also, when you have to fire your weapon, be prepapred to die many times because it's ""auto-aim"" and it sucks. Try a crosshair next time Lucas. Too much to remember here, with respect to the number of keyboard combinations you have to remember. Whoever designed this game needs to follow the lead of Cate Archer. Probably should have called this ""Indiana Jones and the Save Every One Minute"" game."
1,Abysmal,"I was majorly disappointed with the game control and graphics. It was too much like tomb raider for me. I expected more from Lucas Arts, especially considering their excellent efforts with the x-wing/tie fighter sims. Also the fact the game was delayed for almost two years led me to believe that the designers were trying to improve it, but they still released a half ass effort. DON'T buy this game."
2,WAY TOO COMPLICATED FOR ME !,"I bought this game a few days ago and was exited to try it out. It looked pretty impressive from the box. When I found out how it was played with the keyboard I almost gave up right away. There are too many ways to do things .Every time I move I have to look in the book. Another thing is like other games I have , like roller coaster tycoon the graphics are way too dark, I hate that. How can I jump when I can barely see where I am standing or where I supposed to jump to? This kind of thing can be extremely annoying. The graphics are very good, but too dark, Im sure it has plenty of puzzles and things like that people are looking for. I just find the interface awkward and complicated without having to be. Try it and see for yourself,"
1,Game does not run without 3D Accelerator,"Got this game for my husband for christmas. We loved all the previous Indy adventures and were looking forward to playing this one. What a disappointment to find out that this game needs a 3D card! None of our PCs, one of them less than 1 year old, have such a card. We will have to shell out a lot more money in order to be able to play this game. The tiny label on the box informing the buyer of this prerequisite is way too small, especially when buying it online where the box pic isn't life-size! Check before you buy!"
4,A Great Game,"If you like Indy, you are automatically going to like this game. It has lots of action and puzzles in it. This game was a challange. The graphics were amazing but the only flaw in the game would have to be it gets stuck sometimes between a wall and a rock or something. The characters were developed very well and it gave you only a little of the plot at a time. The way the story comes together makes you hungry for more. Can't wait for the next Indy game if it is like this. Most games I beat i toss aside but I have played this one three times over. A must for all adventure fans."
4,Great beginners book,"Honestly a few days ago I did not know a thing about 3D Studio Max 8. All that I knew was that I needed to learn it. This book Ultimately is the beginner's bible for those out there that have no clue about how to use 3d Studio Max. It is divided into sections which cover all the bases from the Overall user interface, modelling, Animation, texturing and finally rendering.If you want to get started on 3D studio max 8 this is the book, But!!IF YOU ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCED AT USING IT THIS BOOK IS MORE OR LESS USELESS TO YOU!!!(Maybe as just a reference but that's it)"
4,Great book,"Great book for 3D beginners, but that's about it. Some tutorials on ligting and shadows are pretty good."
4,Quintessential Bible,"This is exactly what the beginner needs... it's not massive in its scope and it sticks to the meat and potatoes of 3dsMax. If you want to learn the basics and aren't a fan of frills and glamor then this is for you. I suspect that intermediate users would like this book as a refresher or reference. A must own, for a used copy price of course."
1,Trendnet 56K USB Modem,"I was not able to get online using dial-up with this modem. Trendnet's customer support was no help (giving scripted answers that correspond to problem, with no knowledge of what they're talking about). Returned product to Amazon (& received refund) after eliminating all other possible reasons for being unable to connect. Nice little USB modem - if it had only worked."
1,TRENDNET not the best for Macintosh,"I won't buy from this manufacturer again. No Mac drivers.Wrote my own which works great (very reliable, never a dropped connection).I offered to GIVE them to TRENDnet for disc or online distributionand even emailed it to them. They did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!Their software developers must be very lazy. Writing for the Mac is a BREEZE.Their hardware is good, their software is WEAK. Maybe someone will buy them out and restructure. It could only get better."
3,BUYER BEWARE: Good Modem - NO Fax Utility Software - Barebones Tech Support,"While the hardware works exactly as specified (and please make sure to run the driver installation *before* plugging in the modem) be advised there is NO fax software included in the package in spite of what TRENDnet is trying to tell you. This is very misleading.To make up for this glaring omission, I researched a lot on faxing software and became enamored with EssentialFax ([..]). At [..]it was one of the least expensive yet quit comprehensive faxing software I could find.But, of course, it adds another [..]to your fax modem."
5,"TRENDnet 56K USB Data/Fax/TAM Modem (V.92, Kflex56)",USB modem worked like a charm under Windows Vista OS after downloading the latest software from Trendnet's website.
5,another stupid review,this thing worked fine my computer did not have a modem in it I rented a house that only had dial up so I need this thing never again
3,"Works, but hard to fit into some USB ports","It seemed to work fine as a modem, but it was difficult to fit into my laptop's USB port because the plastic casing reaches quite close to the USB connector. Your mileage may vary."
5,usb modem,"Don't use a pots modem often, but needed one to try out a computerized answering system.Works great and at the right price."
1,"It might work, but...,","This may be an alright modem, but I never had a chance to find out!With so many calls, mostly to Hewlitt Packard...without whose help, I would have been lost...and to Trendnet...whose personel - if you could communicate with them at all - were completely untrained and hadn't a clue!- were actually not aware of the fact that the driver cd that came with the product was NOT THE RIGHT ONE. After a week, Amazon allowed me to return and replace it with the US Robotics, which was beautifully documented and worked immediately."
1,TrendNet USB modem,"The item was returned because it doesn't work with Macintosh computers, which is contrary to your advertising of this device."
2,poor product,"Modem never worked out of the box. Computer recognized modem and installed drivers. However would not dial out. No dial tone was detected. Installed internal modem and had no problems. Item was returned for refund. If internal modem is what you are looking for, I would look at other brands and models. This modem also seemed to be cheaply made."
1,Junk....,poorly worked and died a week after I got it. but I was concerned when I got a warning saying reccommend do not install becasue cerifcate was not certified by microsoft! anyone who have to use the modem for fulltime internet dont waste ur time on this or money.
1,Worthless,"Do not buy this modem. I purchased one, installed it and it ran one time then died. What a waste of money."
2,Not a good match for windows 98se,"I was able to install the modem on my old Dell machine with windows 98se and access the internet. However, I could not reboot the machine without removing the TRENDnet modem. I returned the Modem for a full refund."
1,"Forget it, Mac users!",You would think Trendnet could write a driver for this device that would include users of OSX but no such luck.
4,works once you get it set up!,"Drivers on the CD and Manufactures website did not work with Vista 64bit, (not tested with other OS's) Had to actually bring the device back to my house. Connect the laptop via my connection to get on windows update which loaded working drivers. Its on the bulky side, and blocked access to AC plug on the side of a Dell inspiron Laptop. If you have USB ports on top of one another rather then side by side, its recommended you use this modem in the Top port. The design on the housing would block access to said port, if the modem was plugged into the lower one.Now that I know how to get them setup and working, I've purchased 2 of them for customers, . Aside from having to connect to Windows update to get working drivers (vista 64 as least) It was able to connect and function with minimal setup. It's cheap enough to justify the minor setup problems."
1,Never worked Vista 64,"I bought this for my new Dell Inspiron laptop for dialup access while traveling. The software indicated it installed correctly. When I plugged in thisUSB adapter it installed the drivers successfully. The modem never worked. After repeated de-installs, restarts and reinstalls, the unit never worked. There is no support on their webpage and the toll free number for support is in Europe. I'm returning it.I just bought and installed a USR5637 US Robotics modem from Amazon. I installed it in 5 minutes and it works like a charm."
1,Junk,It didn't work. The software did not install properly. The modem itself got hot and I had to remove it.
3,Awesome modem,"I live in a rural area, and have tried several PCI modems, but couldn't get better than 31.2K connect. This TrendNet modem installed easily (Win98SE), and connects at 44K all the time. I'm pleased!"
1,Controllerless = WinModem,"The product info doesn't mention this, but this modem is a controllerless modem (a.k.a. WinModem) which means it only works on Windows (not Linux or Mac). Also, controllerless modems usually perform slightly worse than controller-based modems."
1,Install corrupted my operating system,"Tried to install on a Samsung NC10 netbook running on XP. Got a message saying that the driver software hadn't been certified by microsoft, warning me not to continue. I did not believe that the company would create incompatible software, so I continued with the install.Presto! XP was corrupted, could not re-boot without my system disk, had to reload OS and lost everything on the hard drive.Purchased a new laptop and thought I might use the device on it, but apparently it's not made for Windows 7... I dare not experiment."
2,Nope,"Bought this for the price. I was very suprised, worked wonderful - for 3 months. Then fell apart."
3,"Performance OK, bundled software not so much.","Modem operated as described, later found I did not need it. Bundled software was way more than I needed and didn,t operate as expected. Needed simple phone dialer, not all the ans machine and FAX stuff. Hardware required extended USB cable because it does not smoothly fit in packed ports, not a big deal but not handy to carry. Amazon was terrific on the return!! One of the reasons I shop here first."
4,USB Modem Works Fine,"I am running a Vista Home Premium 64 configuration and bought the Trendnet TFM-560U modem because I understood it would work with Vista. Installation was simple enough. Unfortunately it comes without fax software, and the Vista Home versions apparently do not provide any. However a $20 program from Essential Fax solved the problem as well as providing useful advice on their web site, including the critical fact that some modern phone options, notably VOIP, do not support faxing at all, or may support it only for local calls. The Trendnet hardware therefore may be only a beginning to solving your fax problem. You might start with a query to your telephone company. If buying fax software, you may want to start with a free trial period. In my case, it has all worked fine in the end, and I am able to send faxes as I did before Vista and cable telephone service came into my life."
2,"Great at first, not built to last.","UPDATE: After only a couple months, this modem was found to be fragile (it got bumped lightly, but the case cracked easily). Now I keep getting disconnected, too. I bought the StarTech modem and it's much more durable for only a few more dollars.Small Compact Lightweight Modem Ideal for Users Who Need To Connect To A Dial UpAT FIRST:My new laptop had no dialup modem, and my rural location has ONLY dialup...what to do? I made calls to local vendors and they wanted over $60! Amazon came through as usual, and for less than $30 I'm connected! This thing worked right out of the box, no problems at all. Small size makes it super-portable, too. I love it!"
3,Didn't do what I needed.,I wanted to use this modem with software to record my phone calls. The modem in my PC is 'digital' so I needed a 'voice' modem. The phone recording software did not recognize this as a 'voice modem' as advertised.
1,Completely Worthless!,"I couldn't use it. Nothing but a piece of JUNK! Don't waste your money because that's all this modem is, a total waste of money!"
1,Don't buy this product!!!!!,"I purchased this product for my new computer & it worked fine for 60 days. When I called in, I was told it was the software that came with the modem, but TRENDnet won't support the software. When you call the software company they won't support it because you have to purchase it directly from them. Now I have a modem that won't work & I can't return it. I will NOT but a TRENDnet product again."
1,Only works for awhile......,"Purchased this modem for our nonprofit clinic in Africa. Email is about our only communication tool, so this modem was important. It worked fine for a couple of months, then just quit. Since it's in Africa, I can't really try to return it. Now I need to replace it after only a couple of months. A waste of money that should have been spent on medicines."
3,Vista 64-bit drivers,"The modem drivers on the installation CD and the drivers on Trendnet's website do not work for Vista 64-bit. With the USB modem connected, you need to go to ""Windows Update"" which will load the correct drivers from Microsoft's update site. After that, the modem works fine. This product would have earned more stars if it had not this issue."
4,works better than anything else I have tried,"I have had the weird chronic hives for over a year and a half now. These pills don't ""cure"" them but they work better than anything else I have tried. Benedryl also helps to some extent, but the side effects are incapacitating. These don't make me sleepy or anything."
3,it didn't work for my hives,"Hope it works for others, but it didn't work for mine. the result is similar to other reviews that have been posted."
1,bad,this product does not do anything for hives. it is just a pill that melts in your mouth and does not taste bad
3,Cannot tell if it works,"I have chronic hives and when I've taken this product, it is unclear whether it is working. I suspect that if my problem were purely allergic (it is not), then the product would clear them up."
2,Disappointed...,"Unfortunately, I have not seen any improvement with using this product. Once you have suffered from hives for any length of time, you pray for a miracle cure. Unfortunately, this is another product that does not work."
4,"Interesting, only if it was not theory!","It has in depth coverage of theoretical issues surrounding the field of accounting, but this in depth of coverage makes it long and the dosages of information are condenced. Very heavy for accounting newbies, but pretty interesting for advanced ones.Can be a good companion in the cold, lonely, and long winter nights of an accounting student;)"
5,Accounting Theory is enjoyable with this book!,"I found this new edition of Belkaoui's book which I saw it in a book-fair in Tehran,very well constructed and enjoyable for my students and me,too.Belkaoui arranged the chpters so much better than previous editions of this book.The fourth edition can be more user friend for students.I think it will be one of the best selling books in accounting field because it can introduce a lot of refrences to lecturers and students which think accounting can not be an active dicipline of science.Belkaoui when use the ""Multi paradigm science"" adjective for accounting he means that accounting can leads us to a variety of other diciplines of science that each of them can be a new world for all of accounting students."
1,"Awful, awful, awful, awful","First of all, I hate myself a little just for having bought this book - regardless of whether it came out of a bargain bin, or not. Second, this is the single WORST love advice book on this side of the sun. Serve multi-course meal in a different room for each course? Sure, let me straighten my tinfoil hat first, because the only people that do that think they're being watched by the CIA Brain-spiders.If you have any respect for yourself, or your partner, DO NOT shame yourself by so much as opening this ""book""... and by ""book"" I mean paperback monstrosity... even that is generous of me."
2,I NEED Ideas,"I thought this book would be full of ideas on fun, creative and perhaps unusual dates but it was really more about Mr Godek's thoughts and quips about love and romance.I found The Romantic's Guide to have a good source of dating ideas."
5,Dorati & Haydn Via Australia,"Thank you Amazon for carrying such a large selection of titles from the Australian ""Eloquence"" series! While the majority of the performances in this mid-price import line are available stateside (but as different titles or with different packaging), many are not and needless to say I am snapping those CDs up quickly. This delightful disc features Antal Dorati and the Philharmonia Hungarica performing Haydn's 24 Minuets. With each piece logging in at under 3 1/2 minutes, this ""dance music"" is certainly lighter fare than Haydn's Symphonies though nonetheless enjoyable. In short, these are delightful performances, particularly as played by Dorati & Co., unparalleled Haydn authorities who were the first to commit all of the composer's Symphonies to record. The only thing surprising about this disc is that it is only available as an import. Haydn fans should not hesitate!"
2,Death by Minuet,"On the eastern seaboard of Sinai, the notorious Blue Hole has claimed any number of divers over the years. It looks so becalmed from the majesty of its surrounds and all those tinctures of blue but it is a death-trap all the same. No-one knows how many bones lie at the bottom of the abyss . . . . . .This recording is just as lethal. Yes, Haydn is the master of the minuet but twenty four of them in a row is too much of a good thing. Surely this was the last recording made by the Philharmonia Hungarica: come the final bar, most of those poor devils must have died of the bends. And Dorati reputedly went to his grave with a tremor in his right hand.Here on Amazon, I am a Haydn gladiator - hence the trident-and-net show. But there are limits and the line is here."
3,"Not the most exciting music, loud as you want it. But unique","Strong contrast with rhymic pulses, quiet pieces of almost medival chant - Leifs is trying to create an Iclandic read Viking sound landscape. He likes things to sound primal, forboding, clanging. I'm not sure why people keep saying atonal - it's not like late Schoenberg, or Boulez, not even close. He works more on throwing Thor's hammer around. Some of the works have tuned anvils if I remember right. So, imagined what a tuned anvil would sound like and you are getting in the foundary.As for loud, well it is only as loud as you turn up your speakers.I just found it a little boring. Try Edda instead. Glorious sound, weirdness abounds, unlike anyone else you have heard. And that's a good thing."
5,Great remote replacement for gas fireplace wall switch,"I installed the receiver of this device in place of the simple wall switch used on my gas fireplace. It works like a charm. Now I can lay in bed and turn the FP on or off, and set a timer for it to go off automatically. I think I am a little spoiled with this new luxury!It also has an interesting feature that checks to see if the remote is still nearby while the FP is on. If the remote is no longer nearby after half an hour, the FP shuts down for safety's sake. I believe it does this because, in timer mode, the remote has to send the signal to shut it off, and if it is somehow missing, you want it to shut itself off anyway. It also has a manual override on the wall unit receiver, which is also a nice feature."
2,Slightly misleading,"I am frustrated by this because so many of the remotes that have a display and note anything about temperature are capable of actually turning the fireplace on and off based on the room temperature, this one is not. Why anyone would make a remote that can display the temperature but not turn the fireplace on and off based on that temperature is beyond my comprehension."
2,Didn't work,"I followed the directions to the letter and couldn't get this to work. It does require curing in UV light (no shortage of that in middle Georgia), which was not apparent to me when ordering."
2,Tegner dropped the ball on this one,"Although Bruce Tegner has lots of good things to show people regarding juijutsu and karate, on aikido he has nothing of any real consequence to contribute. He starts the book off by saying that Aikido doesn't really work for self-defense and should be approached solely for art and exercise. Anybody who has seen Steven Seagal in a movie recently knows that aikido can be very effective; what Tegner should say is that it can be awesomely effective, but to get to that level you have to practice for 4 or 5 years."
1,this guy knows NOTHING,"This guy knows NOTHING about the effectiveness of the martial art of Aikido, he says in this book that Aikido doesn't work as self defense, i've been practising Aikido for about 2 years and i know very well that Aikido is a VERY effective art for self-defense and NOT for show. If you want to know about Aikido DO NOT buy this book i recomend Total Aikido by Gozo Shioda."
3,Good...if you know what you're doing.,"I first bought this book long before I learned any Aikido, and it made little to no sense what so ever. Now I am an Aikido-ka and I find this book a very good study aid. In short this book is not a self-contained guide to Aikido merely a study guide for student. If you're looking to learn Aikido from a book...this is not the book."
5,Two Scholars Who Speak the Truth -- in Love,"Living in a frightening world where religious extremists kill innocent people in the name of God, you pray that someone, somewhere, will have the courage to step forward, stop the hatred, and lead us on the path to reconciliation.""Encountering Jesus--Encountering Judaism"" represents an inspirational joint effort on the subject of Catholic-Jewish dialogue by two of the greatest thinkers of our times.It should be no surprise to discover between the pages of this small but powerful book that Karl Rahner and Pinchas Lapide had fundamental faith differences that would never change. What changes most dramatically in this intense, inter-religious dialogue is the reader's heart, as one begins to grasp and respect more fully the holiness of the other. It is a scholarly work and a tremendous achievement."
1,ok but cold be better,"I purchased this faucet because of the look and because I have hard water with sediment. I thought that if I purchased a 2 handle faucet that this would eliminate the need to replace a cartiridge on a single lever faucet. I hate to say it but this faucet has very little pressure. I have very good water pressure but this faucet eliminates a bit of it. The faucet handles turn in the opposite direction than normal so I would have to give it points off for that. Overall, I would not choose this faucet again choose another."
5,DrAGoOoN Fly,This is cool yoyo to play and do string trickshere is the review:1.Time Sleep: about 30 sec and goes haier2.String state: there is two string at first for advise buy duncan string with the yoyoFeatures:*Balance *nice shape *fun to play *havey *strong body outside and moreDefects: *easy string cut
5,Dummies happen.,"I have been an amateur programmer for 27 years, and a dummy for longer that. I have studied Basis, FORTRAN, Pascal,and dozens of other computer languages including C++, and Borland C++ Builder for Dummies is as good an introductory book for C++ as I have read and is very useful even after the dozens of C++ books I have read. The book is in perfect condition and not a pen or paper bookmark. Great product and great Amazon store."
2,Adolescent Tales,"Omaha can count Bright Eyes, Cursive, The Faint, and (in part, since they live in L.A.) Rilo Kiley as its minor league musical successes. On its full-length debut Wild Like Children, Tilly and the Wall have a ways to go before joining the company of their peers. There is an appealing childlike feel to their music (you could also call it rudimentary), and a cynical edge to their lyrics, but the group vocals (redolent of bad high school choruses) are a distraction to these adolescent tales of ennui. The rockers are like an indie-touring company of Grease. Their pop is feckless. That leaves the folk music (""Bessa"", ""Let It Rain"") - proving once again that simplicity has its rewards."
5,A Great Sequel To A Great Game,"Vigilante 8:2nd Offense is a great game. It,like its prequel has great features that every gamer is looking for. You can play it for hours just playing the different combinations on arcade mode with different enemies, arenas,and your chracters! V82 also has great FMV's for each character, with tie-ins from the first one that veteran V8 players will enjoy. The good new features are the new flamethrower,great specials,power-ups that allow you to go over almost any terrain, music, and the awesome upgrade feature that allows you to get cool parts added to your ride, and eventually getting a new chassis for each car! The best feature that really sticks out is the great playability, with the different modes for single and multiplayer play. V82 is definitely a top 5 one of my favorite games."
3,Dreamcast version much better,"This is one of the games I still play on Dreamcast. In an effort to keep the fewest amount of equipment around my tv, I decided to get the playstation version of this game. I must say that I was disappointed in the graphics and how grainy it is. You can't see to far in the distance. I thought it was going to be the same. Oh well. If you've never played this game before, it's still the same fun. I can give it that. I don't want to draw any comparisons to Twisted Metal. I like both. For the price, it's worth a shot but if you still play Dreamcast, get that version instead."
2,Crash's Law Crashes,"Don't believe the hype with this book. Pretentious, deliberately opaque, and just plain boring, this is one of those books that leaves you nonplussed at how the judges of the National Poetry Series justified giving it an award. Yawn."
5,new art,"Karen Volkman's is a voice one does want to see continue. In this book, she offers her own insights & ideas -- poetically, unuquely, metaphorically -- & embraces lyric poetry while remaining as experimental as she weants to be. Clearly she's smart, individualistic, & I'm interested to see what more poetry she proves capable of, as early books tend to be regarded as primarily only formative after the career has been attended to further."
1,"What ""films""?","What ARE the ""films""? Are they movies? What are the ""topics"" of each of the ""films""? The ""description"" of this product is woefully lacking any detail. I would want to know WHAT I am buying. How am I know to whether or not I already own each/some of these ""films""? I have NOT purchased this product because I don't know what is in it; thus my rating is not a review of the product but rather a critique of its description on Amazon. Details needed!"
2,Dvorak in Prague,A 1993 recording and in terms of image quality it shows. The performers ? The Boston Symphony is a shadow when compared to the modern European orchestras. Yo Yo Ma was the star of the evening - played Klid from the Bohemian Forest with great interpretation and feeling. von Stade's interpretation of Rusalka - Song to the Moon was when compared to Fleming's interpretation at the Waldbuhne in 2010 was like chalk and cheese. She sang it like a song that had to be sung - nothing more. Fleming made one feel the emotion of love that I think Dvorak wanted to bring across. Overall a great disappointment as regards quality on all levels. Not money well spent.
2,Might as well watch PBS,"I really enjoyed Yo Yo Ma's short performance on Botti's Boston bluray. So I searched for some others.My displeasure with this DVD is with the sound and picture quality. The performances could have been the best in the world, but I couldn't tell the difference. I received two DVDs on the same day, this one and Grieg, Chopin & Saint Saens Piano Concertos / Previn, Rubinstein, London Symphony Orchestra (2006). The difference in audio and picture quality between the two is vast. I hope to find another video performance, preferably bluray, of Yo Yo Ma and Perlman."
4,the marine band returns to its origins,"Colonel Albert Schoepper is the conductor on this disc and it displays his energetic , take no prisoners personality exactly. He brings out all the drive and energy of these Sousa pieces very well.However, it sounds a little dated. The present-day band is certainly more nuanced and musical and less, ""in your face.""Nevertheless, the Marine Band is here in all its glory and glory it is, indeed. March lovers will love this CD which was probably recorded in the 1960s as Colonel Schoepper retired in 1972."
3,Not Great Sousa!,"Despite the fact that this is the Marine band playing Sousa I would not rcommend this product. The selection of Sousa marches is standard, the length of the CD is too short for the price, and the recording quality is poor. There are better Sousa albums elsewhere."
1,wrong battery for S100,Could be a great battery but wish I had read this review...Wrong battery for S100... it's true it's the wrong one!
1,NOT FOR POWERSHOT S100,This battery is not for canon powershot s100 as they say in the description of the product !!Now I will have to return it
1,Imitation Item sent,I received an imitation battery and not a Canon battery. It did not have any packaging. Buyers please be aware before buying from this seller.Amazon can you please change the description of this item and tell the buyers so that they know that a cheap imitation replacement will be sold and not a Canon battery so that customers dont waste their time and money.
3,So Far So Good,"Seems to be working just like the original batteries did at first, I'm hoping it will last at least a year, so far so good."
1,wrong battery,"yup, wrong battery doesnt fit the canon s100.. sure would be nice if the description was corrected. wasted money and a pain to return."
5,Fantastic replacement battery,I received the product in very short order and have been most pleased with its performance. My camera can snaps many flash photos without running dry. My old battery had seen too much action and could no longer cut it.
1,Does not fit S100,I hope people who own a Canon Powershot S100 read these reviews because it most definitely does not fit! Now I will have to return it and purchase another one. Bummer. I wish the seller would fix the product description.
1,Used batteries are probably not a good idea.,"Bought a used battery for an older Canon S410, but it doesn't hold a charge any better than the battery being replaced, so it was not a wise move."
1,Way too expensive!,"Can't complain about how it works but the price is outrageous. I've had problems with ""compatible"" batteries."
4,"It replaced a damaged battery, it is ok","Why did the old battery swell up and stop working? I dunno. But since the camera uses this battery, I am up and running after a quick delivery."
5,Don't Leave Home without It,If you have a Canon Powershot for more than a couple of weeks (and use it) you will inevitably come to the conclusion that you need a second battery. I have the S410 and the battery indicator only comes on when you have around 4 flash photos worth of power remaining. Then you're out of luck until the battery is recharged. If you have a spare you can go on shooting until the other is recharged. It's a win-win situation and worth the price. My brother-in-law has an earlier powershot and has experimented with non-canon batteries and his conclusion is that it is worth the premium to buy canon's battery. My recommendation: get an extra battery and go with Canon. Plus if something goes wrong you can call up Canon and not worry about voided warranties and what not. You will not regret this purchase.
2,Canon Battery Review,The original battery that came with the camera (Canon S500) gave out after over 1 year of use. I ordered 2 of the OEM batteries through Amazon. They appeared to be the same as the original but they would not hold a charge over 24 hours. I returned them and Amazon sent me 2 replacements. I am having similar problems with these also. I must carry my charger with me at all times.
3,Canon Camera Battery,"I purchased 3 rechargeable batteries for my Canon Elph S110 for the price I would have paid for one elsewhare. The price was great, but unfortunately the batteries don't last long before they need to be recharged. I took them with me on a trip to Sweden thinking 3 batteries would be enough to last for 9 days, but after 5 days, all three went dead. That is not the fault of Amazon though. My old batteries didn't hold a charge well either. Canon needs to come up with a rechargeable battery that holds a charge longer. The price, however, was unbeatable."
5,I recommend it,I bought this as a gift to my girlfriend and we have both watch the first 4 seasons in sequence (not all at once). The product is of great quality and you can see people put alot of work into it. Not a hasty production. It is full of extra material and interviews and making of and deleted scenes. The pictures in the cases are all different and it is all done very well.I strongly recomended if interested.
5,Arguably the best sitcom ever,"Seinfield is the rare bird that appeals to both sexes and has characters who are morally reprehensible in many ways. The 1st and 6th seasons are inconsistent. In the beginning the show was still finding its way and the actors were still trying to define their characters. By the last season the writers seemed to be trying too hard and the humor was over the top. Still every episode has several storylines so some of them are great while others may falter. Kramer sliding and falling is not my favorite part, but that doesn't waste too much time in each episode. The outrageous situations such as the Whale & the golf ball, the fire at the ATM, the Soup Nazi who turns down business showcase what is right about the series. Repeat viewings are still funny and since syndication cuts out parts the dvds are welcome relief."
1,Hiro's Worst Book,"I have read Dilip Hiro's other books, which I am a big fan of, and this one is terrible. It is totally biased against America. It seems that Hiro is questioning Bin Laden's and Al Qaeda's involvement in the 9/11 events. He also seems to have a soft spot in his heart for the Taleban regime, and defends them for not turning over Bin Laden to the US.The historical background he gives on the different nations and religion of the region is excellent and well written. When the book gets into the time of the 20th century and later, it seems that Hiro sides with the radicals, or makes excuses for their actions.America and the West are not perfect, and are part of the cycle of violence in the middle east, but to totally dicredit all of our policies and actions is rediculous. I do not recommend this book, unless you like Al Qaeda and the Taleban."
5,An impressive English translation,"Vergil's Aeneid: Hero, War, Humanity is an impressive English translation of Vergil's classic work of literature. G. B. Cobbold renders Vergil's Aeneid into a novel format with sidebar summaries, which reads very much like an exciting modern adventure story! Enhanced with illustrations, a map of Aeneas' voyage, a glossary of characters, family trees of main characters and gods, a book-by-book outline of the plot of the Aeneid, a timeline of significant events in Roman history, reading group discussion questions, and much more, Vergil's Aeneid truly makes classic literature come alive. Highly recommended for study and discussion groups, and a welcome alternative interpretation for those who are more familiar with Vergil's Aeneid in verse-by-verse form."
4,Action! Action! Read all about it!,"This translation of Vergil's epic is gripping! This version is important for it's expressive language and simplicity. It does not weight the reader down with obscure background, minute details, and lengthy accounts and presents the story in a way that can be read with excitement and immediate understanding. I enjoyed the little whimsical pictures which are on almost every page. This is a fun book to read for anyone interested in adventure narratives or the classical world. It could be particularly useful for a student reading the epic for the first time. Anyone would enjoy it for the intensity of the story itself."
4,I only wish I could see it again and again,"Although this movie is no Pokemon, it does have some great merit. If I could skip school or anything else just to watch this movie, I surely would. Good, God, how I loved this movie. You will love it too."
2,Expensive rooibos that lacks flavor,"I bought this more expensive Rooibos tea (compared to other brands) hoping it would have more flavor. Although the teabag seems to contain more Rooibos it really isn't much more flavorful than the cheaper brands. I am forced to use 6oz. of hot water to steep the tea so it has adequate flavor. I am very dissapointed, especially considering the price. If anybody finds a more flavorful Rooibos please let me know. I am still searching."
5,Not Bitter and Good for You,"I've drinking Rooibos tea almost exclusively since I read an article that Rooibos tea (also known as red tea or red bush tea) has the highest antioxidant content of all the teas (five yrs ago). It is also significantly less bitter than black tea and a lot more flavorful than green tea. It provides many vitamins, minerals on top of the antioxidants. Research it and do your body good!"
3,VERY sheer!,"The costume is nice, the silver material is really pretty, but it seems like it will catch on everything. The sleeves are a very tight. (I'm a size 10). The biggest issue is the white material. It's completely see-through! Be sure to wear a slip or something underneath. The lace is very heavy and not too intricate."
1,Artifice not art,"This album is a big tub of artifice not art. Brian Adams is awful and simply has no voice and probably has nodes on his vocal cords. Pavarotti obviously stands out because he chose the other singers and despite the enormity of his talent (benefit charity or not) offers up shlock. Gustafson has a nice voice, but shouldn't sing Moon River until she learns the words - her voice serves the classical genre better. As for Boceli; I would rather eat worms than listen to another of his tremulous renditions. Sorry, this is pure junk for the ears, regardless of its attempts to raise funds. It does not raise artistic standards!"
1,Worst Hair Product Ever,Got this along with the Rice conditioner and am so disappointed. Leaves hair dry and pastey.....going back to my old product!
2,Ok,I have the shea spray and saw rave reviews on this leave in so thought I would try it..not too impressed. First of all it was VERY expensive and the ingredients weren't very different from other leave ins I have tried that weren't as expensive. I used it once...about a nickel size amount and knew I would never use it again so I contaced the seller to return it and I was going to have to return it as a used item and have a percentage taken off and pay for return shipping. This little bottle was almost $40...give me a break!!! If I bought directly through Amazon I could have returned it for a full refund...just like if I would have bought it from the salon. From now on I will only deal directly with Amazon. I am keeping it and putting it the graveyard hair product box. Huge disappointment!
1,Horrible,"Horrible, horrible movie. Total waste of time and money. Whatched for about 20 minutes, could not take it any more."
3,Silly with humorous moments,Not enough humorous moments. Typical try-to-hard to be funny but falls flat. But that's just me. A 15 year old may get more out of it.
2,Not Funny,I did not like this movie. It just wasn't funny enough and boring at times. Maybe I didn't get the humor.
1,this movie was AWFUL,ugh...total waste of money. I can't believe I really wasted $4 on a movie I watched for 30 minutes and then turned it off.
4,Good Modern Power Metal,"Pyramaze is consistently good. I'd start with this disc and move forward if you like what you hear. Good, clean, heavy, melodic power metal is what you get. Anthemic vocals that never resort to growling with a decidely fantastic feel to the themes/lyrics. Really, this is just excellent metal with some great riffing and production. Buy with confidence. All three of their albums are strong and inter-changeable imho."
3,Not much of a value,"Got this set for $119, which was a decent value for what it is. At the current price of $179, I wouldn't recommend it. I find that I primarily use the Santoku knife anyway, and considering 2 of the 5 pieces aren't even knives---the block and the sharpener, $179 for 3 knives is bit expensive. Try the Pro S 7"" Santoku, it's great, and it's pretty much where the value is in this set, so save your money and just buy the santoku."
5,Perfect Mix,Perfect Dark Zero is one of my favorite video game soundtracks of all time. Its the perfect mix of electronica/techno and epic score. The composer is the very same from the N64 Perfect Dark hit game soundtrack... So old school fans have a reason to grab this one as well. There is even a few vocal songs included from female musicians. If you're a fan of the Xbox 360 game then you NEED to get this soundtrack! You won't regret it. High recommendation!
3,Has its good points,"I bought this book to read alongside Ramsey's text on the Catiline conspiracy for a course that I am taking. I noted that the translation is from 1920 and the writer admits to losing some of Sallust's writing style in the translation. I like the fact that you have the Latin text on the left side and the English translation on the right so that you can compare the two but it is a very interpretive translation. It will do if you simply want to know what Sallust wrote but I would have preferred if it could have preserved some of his style of writing.He is not quite as plain spoken as Caesar but does not have the run on sentences that make Cicero a difficult read. All in all, it is a decent read but an old fashioned translation."
3,The Jimmies/The Weaklings - It's a Split!,"Here I am treated to a double disc collection of punk music from The Jimmies and The Weaklings. I enjoyed it, that much is for sure, but I wouldn't call either band ""amazing"". They're both good, both putting out some solid punk music, and I liked it, didn't love it, just liked it. Not much else I can say about this, two above average punk bands making average punk music. Enjoyable."
2,Images and writing are lacking!,"Pooh uses his five senses to discover his favorite treat - honey. ""SIGHT. Winnie the Pooh has two round eyes. Pooh SEES with his eyes. Yellow and black, fuzzy and fast - he SEES a honeybee."" The Learn and Grow Board Book series is an adorable sequence of educational books for babies and small children; however, ""Senses,"" is my least favorite of them all (8 in the series). I prefer the rhythmic cadence of Lisa Ann Marsoli's, 123 and ABC's, and Andrea Doering's, Colors, in addition, the images and writing in this book are lacking. Birth and up."
5,My kids love this 100th Day book,This is easy enough for my 6 year old and her best (7 year old) friend really likes it too. A fun read for the 100th day of school.
4,Fender,"My 4 year old son wanted this as soon as he saw it on the computer. I had never heard of it before, but it was soft and I thought it would be good. It is, and since then I have also bought the movie. My son sleeps with this toy as well. The stitching on one arm has come undone, which I can fix. Otherwise, nothing has broken yet. yeah!"
2,My sore [rear] proves you can not learn boarding from a book,"You can't learn snowboarding from a book, and I have the sore [rear] to prove it. I am one to try and learn almost everything from a book, be it oil painting, politics or golf. But [,] let me tell you, I studied this book front to back for a few days prior to hitting the slopes, and even practiced in my living room. It does not help. I am a reasonably fit 30-something and I can tell you that the only way to learn snowboarding is by getting on a board, getting the feel of it, taking plenty of lessons and spending plenty of time on the bunny slopes. Whereas skiing is a bit more technical and possibly could be learned through reading a book, boarding is much more feel and you'd best be advised to not kid yourself. As far as the book, it reads more like a snowboarding glossary than a how to book. Bottom line: save the money and buy some ben-gay."
4,All The Numbers!,"If you need the numbers for the T-6, this is the book for you! Dan Hagedorn gives us model numbers, serial numbers, construction numbers, dash numbers and production numbers. He also divulges little known facts about the AT-6/NA-16/SNJ. A truly fantastic piece of research!"
3,Why censor?,"I have a copy of the full version of this movie on VHS and was looking forward to owning a copy on DVD. After receiving a copy of the DVD, I noticed the PG rating. To my dismay, I found that they had censored the 'juicy' parts of the movie. The 'juicy' parts actually portrayed the relationships between the King and his mistress and that between the future Queen and the King's twin brother. I did not find the 'juicy' parts to be offensive in any way but rather it contributed to the storyline as a whole. For censoring the movie, I give it 3 stars. However, I must commend the Studio for the quality of the transfer. The video quality is relatively good compared to the tape version but the audio quality in some parts of the DVD could be improved. I hope that the Studio will produce the full version in due course."
4,I love the musketeer-stories.,"Since I was a kid, some 50 years ago, I am fascinated by the Alexandre Dumas stories about the Musketeers. First by reading the books and later by watching the movies. The 5th musketeer is well filmed and the story is very captivating though somewhat different from the book ""The man with the iron mask"". I am still waiting for a DVD of the movie ""The return of the musketeers"" (1989)."
5,Landmark Anthology,"Dark Forces, edited by Kirby McCauley, is THE horror anthology. It has the best of the best.This is where Stephen King's The Mist, was first published. In my opinion, The Mist is the best thing Stephen King has yet written.You can't go wrong with this anthology. Each story represents the best of each author included. The other standout for me was Robert Bloch's The Night Before Christmas.It is GREAT to have Dark Forces available on Kindle. You owe it to yourself to read this collection if you haven't read it in the past."
5,The other high water mark anthology.,"Dark Forces is the 'contemporary author' equivalent to the other required classic Horror Story Anthology, Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural. Editor Kirby McCauley had a frighteningly accurate eye for not only quality horror, but for literary merit as well. Each tale is a nearly perfect example of the richness the Dark Fantasy/Horror genre has to offer. This anthology is required reading for anyone who loves DF/H or is just curious to see how truly great it is capable of being. An essential collection."
2,Shorter life than expected,This was the big Christmas gift for my husband. He is an elite local player and his team mates loved the ball perhaps even more than he did. We were all very disappointed when the ball stopped holding air after less than a year of regular play.
5,Goalllllllllllllllllllllllllll!,"We gave this soccer ball as a gift to our 11-year-old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She brought it to her soccer practice and all the kids were checking it out. My daughter says it 'plays' really well, has a good feel and bounce to it. This ball was well worth the splurge!!!11"
1,Stay away,I would avoid these as the connectors on them are very poor. We bought one and had two bad ports (1 and 5) that when punched didn't connect through. Spent a lot of time troubleshooting and determined it was the patch panel. Buy the ICC for a little ore money. Sometimes you get what you pay for.
4,TRENDnet 48 Port Cat5e Patch Panel,"The product comes easily marked and has no ""real"" defects or flaws. The problem as I see it is that during termination, you have to hold the block of ports in with your one hand while while punching down with the other hand. If you do not you may have the ports come out. Since this is the only real issue I had with this I still gave it 3 stars but I may go back to my more expensive brand next time."
2,Cheap,"Quality didn't seem to be there. I have never seen a punch panel that you terminate a port on both sides of the panel. Turns out I punched it down wrong and had to redo it at 8pm the night before the live date. Keep your wiring scheme in mind. Not a traditional wiring scheme. Also you must work from the middle out, or your terminated wires get in the way of the open ports."
1,waste of money,we bought these CD's and when I tried to burn the CD's as audio all of them failed after burning one or two songs.
4,Heightened danger or just hype?,"The book covers the intense competition between McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics to be the prime support company to Japan for their FSX program.The book is easy to read. It presents an interesting overview of many of the issues impacting releasability of high technology and American competiveness, and the U.S. Government's participation in sensitive areas of international business. For someone with zero exposure to this arena, the book is a good place to start. Keep in mind that the book is written with an agenda in mind and has a very pessimistic view of this process. If you are pro-American/anti-hi tech export, you will love the book. Otherwise, keep a bag of salt near by during your read.Of course, the so far unwritten sequal is how miserably the FSX program has performed. Did Japan pick the wrong supplier? Were the 'keys' unable to unlock the box? Or was the box Pandora's?"
3,Civil & Structural Engineering,The book is informative but i find it not using SI. In the Philippines we are using SI so it will be time consuming for conversion works. Also the topic for bridge design is limited. I hope it can be expanded by the author.
1,Wouldn't stand up to what I had to do,"Before I bought my Milwaukee, I tried this one. The first one had a faulty foot adjusting mechanism. The second one broke where the blade fits into the chuck.I'm tearing down an old house, so the tools I use get a workout, but my Milwaukee hasn't failed,and I've used it ten times more than I did both Bosches."
2,Just .....OK...,I've heard so much about Tom Kenyon.....The Ghandarva Experience.....was just not for me....nothing special...and I will be donating this to the public library!~
3,Calphalon Stainless-Steel Potato Masher,"I thought I would get a real good sturdy masher and this certainly is one, but I think it is too heavy and the slots should be wider, I use it to start off the mashing and then finish with a regular fork to fluff them up. Not sure I would buy it again."
3,A Decent Iteration of Family Feud,"This Family Feud DVD is entertaining but slow and, at time, fails to hold attention. Players divide up into teams then begin. It will then alternate between teams per round. The downfall is as soon as you get one strike, it goes to the other team to steal. It is a big box that houses just a simple, yet slightly thicker-than-usual, DVD case. Overall, I would give it a C-, it passes but not by much."
2,Need Game Instructions,The video didn't come with instructions so we are to really sure how to play it. It gives you the answer in sequence so there is not way to tell if your answer was the 1st on or last one because they are turned over in order
2,Underwhelmed,Write down answers as a team and then show the answers on-screen. Miss and you're out. I expected the game to be more like the show. One word summary -- disappointed.
3,Family Feud 3rd Edition,"I liked this game, unfortunately it had a glitch or scratch or something so it would only ask 3 questions and then get stuck - we never got to play all the way through. The stealing part can be a little confusing. But we had fun anyway."
1,Inappropriate Reading for Ages 4 - 8,"I bought this book for my [...] grandson but thankfully, I decided to read it before I gave it to him. I have discarded the book. There is an episode where a dirty old drunk with evil thoughts pulls off the towel of the teenage girl who just stepped out of the shower. This is totally inappropriate reading material for young readers. There are also two other similar references. The book should be pulled off book shelves."
5,Listen to a real mariner . . .,"Anyone who has read Joe Upton's other books knows that he has forgotten more about the sea and its changing moods than the reviewer from the School Library Journal will ever begin to understand. If the language is a bit challenging, so much the better. Kids love this book!"
2,SO DISAPPOINTED:-(,"THIS WAS NOT A GOOD BOOK. I'M SO SHOCKED SINCE I LOVE TC BOOKS. FIRST, THUIS GIRL STACY IS NOT THE GANGSTA B7432 THAT THE AUTHOR HYPES YOU UP ABOUT.FOR ONE, I HAVE WATCHED TOOOOO MANY MOVIES, READ TOOOO MANY BOOKS, AND KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN JAIL, TO KNOW THAT YOU DO NOT DISCUSS UR BUSINESS OVER THE PHONE. THE UNTOUCHABLES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SO SMART, SO UNTOUCHABLE, THAT THEY DISCUSSED EVERYTHING OVER THE PHONES. STACY IS STUPID.I WILL NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO READ THIS, UNLESS YOU JUS WANNA READ ALL OF TP BOOKS, OR UNLESS YOU ARE BORED.THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE BOOK, WAS HOW I THOUGHT THE SNITCHED WAS STACY'S ROLL DAWG, LISA AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE SOMEONE ELSE. BUT, THE SNITCH SEEMS TO ALWAYS BE THE ONE WHO IS STRUNG OUT ON THEIR OWN SUPPLY."
2,I didnt care too much for this one....,"I too, am a TCP fanatic...I go to the book store and look for the 3 crowns...However, I bought this book by MISTAKE...I was unhappy with the author's debut novel Keshia...and being that I look for anything with the 3 crowns on the cover I picked up Stacy not realizing who wrote it...With that being said, I dont want to give away the plot but I do believe that the author made a poor attempt to write from a woman's point of view...A lot of the emotions was played down and most of the story was just plain unbelieveable...I mean I know that it is fiction and all but I think the author over reached with this novel as well as his debute...I am a TCP fan thro and thro however, I will NOT purchase another book written by this author"
3,Slow Yet Steady,"I would have to say that I am also a Triple Crown Fanatic, and I usually love all the books that TCP push out. However, Stacy was too slow for my taste, I put down the book more times then I picked it up. The story started to pick up towards the end, but thoughout the book, the story was not so good. I do have to say that the grammer usage, editing was really good, especially with it being from TCP."
3,EXPECTED MORE!,"LETS SEE HOW CAN I PUT IT, OM STACY ENDS UP IN JAIL AND THEN SHE JUST SLIPS UP ALOT IN THIS BOOK LIKE EXAMPLE EVERYBODY KNOWS NOT TO TALK ON THE JAIL PHONE, BUT HEY SHE DID. ALSO REVEALING THE SNITCH TOOK FOREVER I MEAN I WAS LIKE OK ALREADY. A LOT OF PARTS JUST DIDNT OR SHOULDNT BEEN A PART OF THIS BOOK I READ IT THREW DOE AND IT WAS ALRIGHT JUST EXPECTED SO MUCH MORE...SORRY!!!!!"
2,Not Happy,Out of all the TCP books I have read I would have to say this is not the best by far. It didn't seem real even if it was movie.
1,HATED IT......,STACY WAS ONE OF THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IT MADE SO SENSE TO ME AND THE ENDING WAS DUMB DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY TRUST ME.
2,not good for the car,"This product is not spill proof, plus is very difficult to empty out the last of the water, which makes cleaning it a problem."
4,I have conquered the kitty(ies)!,"Ahhhh, no more water all over the floor. It's a perfect design for this...however the only flaw is emptying it out to clean it...it's virtually impossible to get all the water and floaties out without taking a towel or rag to it...otherwise...NO KITTY can topple this one!"
3,OK product,This bowl has it's merits. It does cut down on the spills on the floor. It would be an awesome product if the top came off for cleaning. It is a real pain to try and clean and get all the dirty water out because of the lip. I have to take about 20 minutes cleaning it in the sink every time.
5,Perfect for puppies!,"I really like these bowls. They are great for puppies and don't spill like it says. The spill-less top is attached to the rest of the bowl, it is one piece. Because of this, it makes it a bit harder to clean to get the soapy water out, but I would rather that than the other adult size bowl I have, which the top comes off, making it easier to clean because, if you have ever had puppie before, they will get the top off it somehow. I really like the overall quality of the bowls, made very well, are very durable, and very easy to use. I will continue to use these for my puppies."
2,Still Spills.,"This product is supposed to prevent spilling, and yet my dog still makes a huge mess with his food. Its not even a smaller mess. Also, this bowl is HUGE for my 16 pound dog, but its the only one like it. They really need to make a spill-less bowl for small dogs. This bowl is the size my dog!"
3,Surprised,"Not quite what I expected. It travels the realms of many types of fetishism, some a bit more distasteful than I expected."
4,A good way to begin to internalize the Odu,"I think this is a good book for those that want to read and understand the Odu within some context. (especially those that do not have the right to perform merindinlogun, but want to understand what they see when it during divination sessions) I only wished it was larger."
1,Biased Presentation of Judaism,"I would give this book zero stars if it were possible to do so. Kugel's presentation of what it means to be a Jew in the world today has a heavy-handed Orthodox bias that is most present in its presentation of other Jewish movements. The most disappointing aspect of the book was Judd Lewis's (Yehuda HaLevi's) failure to raise any serious questions to the dogma and doggerel laid down by the man who is supposed to convince him not to intermarry. If you are seeking a good book about what it means to be a Jew today, check out any of Joseph Telushkin's books, which, though written from an Orthodox viewpoint, manage to present all forms of Judaism without bias/"
5,Great Workout!,This workout is great! You get a great cardio workout with no impact and no need for shoes. I workout 3 to 4 times a week. I love this workout because it is challenging without being hard on your joints. It is not for beginners but is a great way to get in shape and burn some calories.
4,Cardio Barre,"I really enjoy this dvd. I use it when I want to get some cardio in for the day and I don't feel like going on the treadmill.Pros:-As the dvd promised, there's no jumping or similar strenuous moves.-Lot of repetition which I like and I generally enjoy barre workouts.Cons:-Some of the movements are too quick that I'm not sure if the movements are effective for me.Some people complain of the music, but I don't really notice because I'm concentrating on the workout. I recommend this dvd to people who want a fast paced, cardio and love barre workouts."
5,Beautiful,"A wonderful love story and that really captures the life she led. As I read the letters, so many Judson and Marion memories came to me."
3,Breaking the Missional Code:Your Church Can Become a,"The book is great for developing a vision for transforming a dying church into a vital part of the community. The book seems to repeat itself. Great information, not fun to read."
2,Some good content,"This book has some good content, but in its attempt to present methods for people to use, it ignores the fact that the Bible has shown models and methods that make a ton more sense then reiterating over and over terminology that has been created for the point the authors are making. Read the book, but look at what the Bible says. Hopefully you have studied the Bible first."
5,A serious and inspiring read with a movie related title,"This book is a MUST READ for any pastor/church leader serious about reaching people for Christ and not content to just ""play church""."
4,Good luggage knife,"I bought several of these to give away as gifts and kept one for myself. This little knife definitely has it's place. The only problem I have with it is that it's all knife and no blade - the blade itself is very small. On the other hand, that's what makes it useful; I can put it in my luggage without worrying about it being confiscated. When folded, it just looks like any other bottle opener.If you're visiting places where they are sensitive about the type of knife you are carrying, this one is perfect. It's utterly inoffensive, small, light and the bottle opener even works.I carried it around Ireland for a couple weeks and it did fine for all the little jobs you carry a pocket knife for. I keep it in my luggage and it has traveled dozens of times with me."
2,"As a bottle opener, I didn't find that it worked that well",I read most of the reviews and bought this product and maybe I'm the only one but I had trouble with the bottle opener in that it would slip off the bottle cap. I would get it under the bottle cap and start to pry and it would start to come off but then it would slip because you couldn't get proper leverage. I let my friend use it at a party and gashed his hand up pretty badly when the thing slipped off the top of the bottle cap. I found the knife to be pretty useful when opening packages or anytime you needed a small knife. I know some people have said they can get it past security but I just saw a TSA agent confiscate one on my last flight. Overall I wouldn't buy this product again and would just a regular Swiss Army knife which I can get better leverage.
4,another Buck quality product,"I own several Buck knives, and have always viewed them as a quality product at a satisfactory price. As per my expectation, this product lived up to my ""Buck standard.""I rated it four stars, as the blade could be a bit longer.The blade fit very tight, and does not move when locked open. The bottle opener feature will certainly come in handy."
4,This is Fire!,This old school NY sound is what got me into house music in the first place! Todd Edwards is the master of making syncopated beats with clipped and chopped drum samples. This album for me is like a snapshot of where I was at in the Early/mid 90s. Full of soul - and highly recommended.
5,superb,This is a absolute must have album. I have admired Todd's work for many years. Please deliver more albums.Any body that is in to garage music should have this in there collection.
5,Execellent Document of Martin's World,"Very detailed, artwork is solid, if not outstanding. Gives a fine format for exploring Martin's world."
3,Go for a studio release instead,"The clock-punching production mutes any potential vibrancy the live setting might have lent the songs, and the ""setlist"" leaves out enough gems that the disc won't work as a ""Best Of"" set, either. If you're new to the band, you're better off picking up any one of the studio releases first. This is an amazing band, and I suspect you'll be back for the others no matter which you choose. This one might not have the same effect. Longtime fans who have seen the band live might be a tad disappointed that the immediacy doesn't translate to disc, but how could it? It's still an essential recording for the devout."
3,Sunny Day Real Estate- Live,"When the famed real estate company released ""Diary"" way back in 1994, their production quality was marvelous. Unfortunately, it's still the same now. I say unfortuately because of ""Live"" being, well, a live album, and half of the concert seems to be edited out. But besides that, ""Live"" has all the right songs (""Every Shining Time You Arrive"", The Blankets Were The Stairs"", ""In Circles"") as well as an excellently recorded version of ""Guitar And Video Games"". Eingk's voice is truly uplifting, and so are his lyrics; which make a splendid combination of emotion and ruggedness. The guitar work on ""Live"" is quite good too, with the sound staying in one place instead of flying aimlessly around the venue like it so often does. However having seen Sunny Day Real Estate live myself, I feel ""Live"" doesn't do justice to their incredible on-stage show. Despite this, ""Live"" should be a good introduction to new fans and a wonderful memoir of albums past."
3,Pleasantly Disappointing,"Having seen Sunny Day in their first live show after recording How it Feels, I was hoping to relive some of the that sensational performance. Unfortunately the production of the recording was second-rate. This draws the listener into an uninteresting and inaccurate account of their live shows. Due to the poor recording, the intensity and emotion of the music are stripped away and this being an emo-core band, the release of the album does Sunny Day a disservice. The upside is that this is Sunny Day and it is hard to wrong with any of their material."
4,A great sounding live album,"I was a bit hesitant buying this, but it sounds great. I have to say the high point is ""Song About an Angel"", a song that I think sounds much better here than it does on Diary, especially considering that I think ""How it Feels..."" is their best album. ""Pillars"", ""Guitar and Video Games"" and ""Every Shining Time You Arrive"" are wonderful as well. Highly recommended, especially to any Sunny Day fan."
4,Of course it's good...,"Sunny Day Real Estate is almost the very definition of what a rock band should be. They've got such an embarassment of riches, that it almost isn't fair. For those of you have never seen them live, then please do. This album just gives you a taste of their brilliance, but it doesn't do everything for you that attending an actual show would. For now, it is good enough..."
2,A contractual obligation,"Sunny Day Real EstateLive; 1999Sub Pop RecordsMy Rating: 4/10This was a ""contractual obligations"" album I guess, released by Sub Pop after the band jumped ship post-HOW IT FEELS. The performances themselves are muscular enough I suppose, but as far as live albums go, the recording and production are pretty flat. The one highlight is the closer, ""Days Were Golden,"" magnificently executed live. Other than that, would it have hurt to fill all 80 minutes of the plastic disc with music? Surely SDRE was playing more than 11-song sets on their first reunion tour. For fanatics only..."
4,"Repsonse to Music Fan from Bflo, NY's comments","Obviously you are incompetent. Opinions aside, the fact that you said only two songs were not on the last album is grossly incorect. Five of the eleven songs, almost half were older, with three from Diary (In Circles, Song about an Angel, & the blankets were the Stairs), and two from the pink album (J'nuh & Rodeo Jones)"
4,almost,"Sure, it is SDRE alright, but i was mildly dissapointed with this one. Don't get me wrong, Sunny Day is fab, but I expected a wee bit more out the guys than this. The drumming is tight and the guitars sound marvelous, but the bass and Jeremy's vocals leave something to be desired (please don't hate me for this). It's not to say that Mr. Enigk doesn't sound good, he just doesn't sound great (esp. on ""Song About An Angel""). Oh, well, it is a must have for all you broken hearted rock fans out there."
2,"poor recording, poor engineering, poor representation","i bought this album and video. they both are horrible as faras audio quality goes. what a joke. any fool could record this better on a microcasette recorder. the drums sound like cardboard boxes. blah. good songs, just a horrible job with realease. and to leave songs where strings are broken and the guitars fall out of tune! what fools. don't buy this, instead give the band an extra $20 when you see them live"
4,In the nick of time...,"I needed this out-of-print book for a holiday gift to my singer son. Priority shipping options were not clear, and the book needed to cross the country, from California to Maryland. Happily, it arrived on December 23. So, after some anxiety all turned out well."
1,Poor image quality creates anti-alaising artifacts,"Perhaps the worst issue with this unit is that the resolution is so low (vastly lower than even a $59 digital camera) that text edges are extremely rough with huge pixels. With small/narrow fonts, this makes character recognition very difficult. After short periods of use, I get serious headaches from the poor image quality.I tried ""snapshot"" mode on one page, then did the same thing with my Sony camera in closeup mode. The Sony image is sharp/crisp and even though the magnification is not as high and the screen is much smaller, the type is far easier to read on the cheap Sony. It's also no where near as clear an image as a KindleIn this day and age, they should be able to provide a far better image, particularly for this extremely high price. Almost $600 for something only useful for short looks at bills, signing checks, etc is absurd."
4,third time reading,"pages was cut off but best read,the characters are well told and make one see visuals them in the head"
5,A GREAT LOVE STORY!!!!!!,I loved this book!!! I read it in one day. The book was well written and told an excellent story. This is the 2nd book I have read by Keisha Ervin and she is becoming one of my farvorite authors.
5,SMOKIN LIKE A JOINT !!!!,I LOVED IT !! THIS BOOK KEPT ME EXCITED AND CURIOUS..... ANDREW GOT WHAT HE DESERVED !!!! VICTOR AND MINA ARE A PERFECT COUPLE... THIS WAS A GREAT READ !! I LOVED IT
5,Amazing,Read this series of books you will not be disappointed. Several 5 star reviews have already broke this down so I will just say AMAZING.
5,Well Done above 5 stars,"If it had more than 5 stars it would have 10 this is the best book that i have ever Read. Keisha displayed that you should be your self and you should not let any one change you for nothing. She also made known that no matter what you look like that there is someone that will love you for you. With Mina this is what happened to her soon to be husband Andrew , was not all he seemed to be and that soon came to the light , Mina finds her true love in the end and almost risk her life in the processes. Please read a very excellent book. YO go Keisha Ervin.... hope this was not the end!!!!!."
4,"Sad, Fun, and Hilarious",I really thought Mina's Joint was a good read. I like how she not only gave you a dramatic side but a funny side as well. Thumbs up for me.
3,I don't recommend Minas Joint,Minas Joint was to me an OKAY read. It kept my attention most of the time but the story was unrealistic & predictable.I read Minas Joint right after I finished Chyna Black (Which I really enjoyed) so needless to say I was expecting a lot.The book was a let down because in my opinion the story line and the over book just could have been better.
5,One of your Best!,"Well Keisha, you did it again... Mina's Joint was worth waiting for.. but I have one question.. Do you plan on writing a sequel about Mina and Meesa establishing a sisterly bond? That would be a great sequel. I was loving how you had us on a roller coaster ride with Victor and Mina wondering what they was going to go through next. Excellent Job! Keep up the great work!"
3,Did I want him? OH YEH!!!!!,I tell you Victor is unlike any man that I have known. Do they really make men like that? If they do I am definitely looking for one cause I definitely fell in love with Victor. The best parts of the books was Victor's. That other dude really sucked I really don't see why she would want to be with anybody like that in the first place I don't care what amount of money that he had. The book was alright it had some good parts in and than there were some get on with it parts. I realy did like that the author made the main character in this book a thick girl. This book would make you want to fall in love if you already haven't.
4,Very Good Read....,"I read Torn first, then decided to purchase Mina's Joint. I was not disappointed, but I thought it would be heart-wrenching like Torn and it was not. The best part of the book was Mina's family. Her mother and Auntie had be rolling...... Good Job Keisha."
4,Love it!!,I really love this book..I have all Keisha books..I think she is a very good author..I just love how the book show u both ways of how ppl reeally act..
4,A GOOD BOOK,THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK IVE READ FRM THIS AUTHOR AND I WAS HOOKED FRM THEN IVE READ ALL OF HER BOOKS NOW
1,A poorly conceived and poorly performed version,"I would have given it no stars but that doesn't seem to be possible. This version is set in New York and that doesn't work very well. For example, the Eisensteins live in an apartment in a high rise building and the tenor (who normally comes in from the garden) comes on a window washers platform. Even worse, the singers are mostly barely acceptable. The Austrailian opera usually does much better."
4,"It's a fatty, but it does what it's supposed to","This adapter works perfectly fine with my usb cable, keeps it charged up, no problem. I got it from one of the new/used vendors for about $4, and I've got no complaints. It is a little weird though- One, it is HUGE, not so big as to make it a liability, but big enough to make you say, ""really? that big?"" I kind of want to open it up and see if it has a lad weight in it to justify its bulk. Two, the usb plugs in the middle of the back of it; I expected it to plug into the bottom so it would hang when plugged into the wall. This orientation makes it stick out from the outlet by a good two inches plus, which is a little awkward, but I've got it plugged into a power strip, no prob. Worth the four bucks plus shipping I spent for it, but honestly, I'd just go get one of those generic usb ac adapters that are slightly more diminutive if I were to do it again."
5,LOVE IT!,"This thing is so awesome....I have my Zune hooked up to a small sound system in my kitchen and pretty much keep it plugged in there most of the time. I hated having to fire up the laptop to charge it every time it died. Now I just keep this plugged in right there by it and it's so easy to recharge when needed. AND because it's a USB plug, it'll charge anything that uses a USB cord. Itouch, etc. Wonderful little thing, you can take it anywhere, fits in your purse!"
5,Pleased!,"No problems - nice price! Charges Zune more quickly than aftermarket models. Only negative is the size of the unit - not convenienet to plug into power strip, otherwise great unit."
4,Just ok.......,"I bought 2 and they work ok, but they are a little bulky. I have a couple of other usb adpt'r and they are a lot smaller, but have a higher rating than these. Considering the price I paid for these I'm happy"
5,Works great!,"My hesitation to buying an AC Adapter for my Zune was the price, but the cost has dropped drastically. It is very easy to use. I usually just leave it plugged into the wall outlet (or powerstrip) and then just remove the usb cord whenever I need to update my zune. It works great and looks very nice for an adapter. It has a usb port on top, so it also works great with other mp3 players with a usb cord for a charger - my ipod charges just fine with this adapter, leaving me no reason to purchase another adapter."
4,Wise investestment...,"I checked online for a way to charge my Zune without a computer and the cost was about $20!!! Purchasing this charger saved me over $15 dollars and it does exactly what I need...BTW, the charger uses the same sync cable that comes with the Zune."
5,Great item Awesome seller!,Got the item sooo quick my head spun!! The seller packaged the item well and shipped lightning fast. I REALLY needed this and I am pleased with the whole process.
3,An AC Adapter,It works. What else can I say. I wish it were designed so it didn't cover other outlets when I plug it into my power strip.
2,"Adapter, but no cable","Note that this product includes only the AC adapter but no additonal cabling to attach to the Zune. So if you were thinking about having one cable to hook to your PC and another to charge if you are away from you PC, remember to take the Zune cable with you. For $29.95 I expected them to include the 25 cent cable."
5,Must have for Zune or Ipod,"I got this charger for my Zune 30GB and my Zune 8GB, it has worked just as to should, plus it will also charge my cheap MP4 player and even my friend's Ipod Touch 16GB. I love the Zune look to it and the feel of it.Update 1/11/2010, I ordered my adapter from LLYtech They are selling them for a penny plus shipping, The adapters they are selling are Genuine Microsoft Zune Chargers. The only difference between the one I ordered direct from Microsoft 2 years ago(for $40 plus shipping) is that there is not packaging with the one from LLYtech, it is still very easy to tell that it is brand new and Genuine.Update 1/28/2010- I bought another AC adapter and Zune USB Cable from LLYtech, both where OEM true Microsoft and worked perfectly."
1,Static shock,"When I had my Zune connected to this device I used a surge protector, however every time I'd touch the buttons on it static shock would cause it to act erratically. Eventually my Zune locked up completely. I was able to sync it again with my PC and get it to work again, but it tacked on to the end of the corrupt hard drive space and I lost space overall to add media to my Zune. You are better off just charging the Zune with a PC."
2,Shame,Microsoft and Apple both should be ashamed for providing wall chargers without the necessary cabling--that's false advertizing and greedy---$30 for the little box that goes in the wall--probably worth only $2-3 and they couldn't provide the cable. Now I gotta unplug the cable from the back of the computer every time... ugggh!
3,"Neat, easy to use","Small and simple. Easy to use. You can use your zune anywhere, no need to take your laptop to charge it."
3,Very good but could have been better,"I purchased this flashlight to go with the 14.4V Porter Cable drill I purchased a month ago. I appreciate the flashlights bright light, nice ergonomics, spare bulb, solid construction, good looks and of course, the main reason I got it, compatibility with my drills charger/battery. I would have liked it more if the beam was adjustable (like Maglights are), and if it had an intermediate switch that allowed for quickly flashing the light on/off without having to fully click it on then click it off. If you already have a 14.4V charger and battery then this flashlight is worth getting; but it could have been designed a little better."
3,Check your battery pack first...,"If, like me, you purchased a Porter-Cable Cordless 14.4v Drill/Driver and are looking to add the convenient flashlight, take note: not all Porter-Cable 14.4v D&D's are alike. My drill, purchased just a couple of years ago, uses batteries with a protuding stem, Battery Pack #8720. This light uses a battery pack with a nearly flush top (#8723). Learn from my mistake and save the frustration (and return shipping cost)."
5,Hand Light,"I bought this on a whim. Thought I could use it in tight places and under tables on which I do wiring for a model railroad. This lamp is far superior to the ones I had been using. You can direct the light, it stays steady on the floor and no cord to drag along. Wish I had purchased it years ago."
3,The missing bird & what to do,"I got this book and was very taken by the beautiful drawings but when I looked at the book more closely it didn't have a 9th bird on page 17. I finally figured out that the bird got swallowed in the binding. I solved the problem by scanning page which shows all the animals, cutting out the missing bird and carefully taping in. Voila, I can read the book to my preschoolers--but I really think this book deserves better production. Check it out carefully and count all the animals before you throw away your reciept!"
3,The content is not the problem,"My daughter fell in love with this book after taking out of the library, so we decided to add it to our personal library. The quality of this book is not nearly as good as the copy we borrowed. The paper doesn't feel the same, you can see the binding when reading it and it's not as heavy. The best thing about this book is the artwork and the subpar printing quality definitely takes away from it. My daughter (who's 18 mo) doesn't mind, but we're currently looking for an original printing."
4,Sweet and simple,"This is a very sweet and simple counting book, good for babies and toddlers, but even older children can enjoy its beautiful artwork."
3,"A little overacted, but ok","It's a cute movie, but animals trying to help a human in relationships... it was a bit much. Worse that his character was actually taking their advice (ie peeing to mark his territory?). Not a big fan of them portraying a guy as such a loser. The loser part was a bit overacted.... as usual. Oh well, it's entertainment right? LOL All in all, don't expect to be impressed. Expect a silly movie and have fun."
1,Same old formula talking animals - sooooo cute.,"Dumb, stereotypic juvenile talking animal humor for adults (or juvenile adults depending upon point-of-view). Same recycled multiple times storyline of loser lover finding himself (with the help of the animals of course) and gets the girl some girl in the end. NOTHING imaginative in the writing, acting or whatever. Overspent valuable time even writing this much. Good fit with Horrible Bosses.Some naturalists believe that the cute zoo animal syndrome is actually contributing to species extinction by humans because they don't look so cute in nature thus who cares."
4,"Expected a BIT MORE, but it was ENTERTAINING....,","I thought it was ok. A light romantic comedy. Suitable for kids. I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, but the kids wanted to watch this movie, so I went along. I did expect a bit more of it, it was quite predicable, but it was entertaining. And the kids liked it. Talking animals always seem to have magical effect on kids. Kids favorite was probably the gorilla, and his reaction when they got to TGIF. That TGIF scene, together with the scene where the zookeeper (Kevin) is imitating the bear's walk, and the scene where the lion first talk to Kevin, (""... we need to talk"") are the best, and most memorable scenes. Our 6 year old, and 11-year-old, still repeat those lines, and are still having fun with it. It was a real fun movie."
3,Kevin James' movies always seem to exceed the expectations set by the previews,"The previews for Kevin James' movies always look stupid; focusing on pratfalls and juvenile humor. The movies always exceed the previews, revealing heart and grace the previews never hint at. A great movie? No. A movie I enjoyed? Yes.Plus: Rosario Dawson!"
3,"Harmless, and mindless, fun.","Kevin James is a good comic actor, when the comedy is slapstick physical humor or one-line zingers. He has the emotional range of a bowl of porridge. So this movie is fun when he's doing pratfalls or exchanging quips with the animals. When he puts on his plaintive face and tries to be serious, it descends to mush. He's not helped by some of the most trite dialog ever written and a plot that is obvious within the first five minutes.Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb do their best with caricatures rather than characters. I wish they'd been given something more meaty to work with- both could have played good comic roles if they'd been given the chance. However, the animals aren't expected to be serious so they get most of the best lines and the best action.This is a light-hearted way to spend an evening when you don't want anything thought-provoking and you'll get some good laughs along the way. That can't be a bad thing."
4,Fun Movie,"Movie is fun and funny too. Both for kids and a bit older too. Great job with animals especially the gorilla, wonderfully real looking and moving. Great with other animals talking too. CGI has come a long way."
4,cute and funny,I like the actor Kevin James. And I think this movie was very cute and funny. Great for a family night.
2,Not even our 4yr old was interested!,We are huge Kevin James fans from King of Queens! But some of his films are flops! This is one of those flops! Its got talking animals so we thought our 4yr old would like it. Not even she was interested. Unfortunately it was more dumb than funny!
5,"Funny, funny, funny",I like movies with animals. With the fact that these animals talk makes this movie even funnier. Kevin James always play in funny movies.
5,Love it,This is clearly a very funny movie with all the characters. Great movie for the entire family. It was exactly what I wanted and needed: a good laugh.
4,Christmas gift,This was a gift for my daughter-in-laws father he had seen the movie before and laughed all the way through it
5,zoo movie,was a great family movie very enjoyable something children and adults will enjoy might even want to own in their home to view
3,Better than i expected,"Much better than his Mall cop movie, this one has a pretty good story, is funnyat places and there are less embarassing moments than i tough there would be,especially when your dealing with a overweight zookeeper and 2 lovely women.It was fun to see what they did with the animals...by making them talk. Theanimal script was pretty good and not too stupid. Each individual animal hadhis/her character... and the best work came from the Gorilla character. Whenyou check the special features you;ll know what i meant.So for a light comedy i do recommend this movie."
3,"Light on laughs, good first date movie",The movie was just ok. It really wasn't that funny. Like a typical Kevin James film it has a lot of physical humor but the humor is typically low brow. The underlying story line is a love story and unfortunately even that has very few surprises. It is suitable for a first date movie but won't hold a kid's attention.
5,Love it!,Such a wonderful and lighthearted movie; you'll be happy to have this as a part of your DVD collection.Donald the Monkey: Throw poop at her!
4,It was a funny cute comedy - dont take it to seriously,"I am a big Kevin James fan and also love those silly ""animals can talk"" type movies. I thought this was really cute and I enjoyed it. Kevin James plays the usual funny chubby guy that you cant help but to love. Dont take this movie to seriously. Just enjoy it for the many funny laughs and the in general silliness. Dont expect a complicated story line. Just enjpoy Kevin James doing his thing and appreciate the cuteness of the talking zoo animals. Good for kids and adults. A nice clean comedy:)"
3,ZOOKEEPER,"I'M NOT MUCH INTO JAMES KEVIN, THE MOVIE WAS NOT BAD AND SOME ADULTS MAY GIVE HIM MORE STARS THAN I DID, I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER SAID IT WAS GOOD AND FUNNY, I GUESS WHAT I CONSIDER FUNNY, IS NOT THE SAME. I DID WATCH THIS ONCE ALL THE WAY THOUGH."
1,Did not live up to expectations,"We had high hopes for this movie. I know it was not Academy Award material, but we just wanted to laugh. It was painful to watch and I kept thinking how embarrasing for the main actor. We are adding movies to our library and enjoy watching good movies over again. This is one we will not be viewing again."
2,Awful,"I really like Kevin James, but this movie was awful. We did not even finish watching it. Would not recommend."
5,Hilarious,You just gotta love Kevin James! This movie was just great. Really love the main character and also the part Rosario Dawson plays. There are still some parts that I smile every time I think of.We've watched it a few times and I'm still not sick of it yet.
5,BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!,You gotta see this movie! A great FAMILY MUST SEE MOVIE!!! It will have you laughing!Kevin James is such a great actor and the rest of the cast is Wonderful!
4,Better than I had antisipated!,"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Expecting a silly, sophormoric comedy, I had many laugh-out-loud moments and was entertained throughout. Was it silly? Yes, some of it was. But I would watch it again!"
4,The Chubby Zookeeper,"The starting scene just caught my fancy with the failed proposal in that I wanted to see this movie through. I loved Kevin in his supporting role in Adam Sandler's Grown Ups and I just wanted to watch him again but this time the lead actor of a comedy. He was so funny in imitating the animals in his cubby-ness. The movie had some voice over in the animals with personalities such as Sandler as the monkey, Stallone as the lion, Cher as the lioness, and Nick Nolte as the gorilla. If you are a fan of movies like Babe, Cats and Dogs or any movie with talking animals, this might interest you. The movie is a hit with my kids and we all loved it."
5,Hilarious Comedy,"I was pretty skeptical of this movie at first glance. I mean c'mon, talking animals? It couldn't be THAT good. After watching the movie I have most definitely changed my view. This movie had me laughing from beginning to end! In fact, I enjoyed it so much I watched it again the same evening with my family of four, and they all loved it just as much as I did! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind and is ready to laugh until you cry! Kevin James continues to be one funny guy!"
3,Good rental.,"It is a good, but no a great, movie. However, in a landscape of mediocrity it shines, and it is not offensive.The plot and storyline are simple, and at times predictable. This silly romantic comedy is valued as just entertainment."
4,Zookeeper is just ok,This movie is slow but has some highlights. It is a good family movie but could be more exciting and less boring. Seems like the same old stuff.
5,zooleeper,I loved this movie really enjoyed it Its funny romantic so enjoyable to watch. I liked it so much my grand children watched it on my. Kindle fire also and some friends also a must buy a movie you can watch over and over
3,conservative review,"I watched this movie from one of the reviews listed. They said it was clean and fun, for the whole family.If you are a conservative Christian you may not enjoy this movie. The summary of the movie is a man that works at a zoo and the animals talk to him and coach him on how to win a woman's heart.A wolf teaches him to urinate on his territory, a bear teaches him to show his ""pudding cup"", his groin.The gorilla seem to be the only animal who had wisdom.I didn't enjoy this film because I'm tired of this generation that thinks the only premise of a movie is sexual undertones in a rated PG or PG-13 and sadly some G rated.I feel the movie industry has truly lost their ability to produce family films. They forgot what righteousness is."
1,Shouldn't it be at least a little bit funny?,"This is the first review I ever write, and the only reason I take time to do this is that the movie is really terrible. Don't waste you time and your money!"
5,movie,Purchased for a gift at Christmas. The intended person has not received it as of yet. After all it is Christmas morning. Wow you people are quick
3,A few funny moments,"The film has a few funny moments, but the most entertaining moments were shown in the trailer. It's worth watching, but not necessarily worth buying... only reason I bought it is because my dad loved it and it's a Christmas gift for him."
5,awesome and funny,I would recommend this to anyone. It is good to know there is still some clean humor in our nation which good families can watch together and enjoy.
4,Good,This a real good movie and the copy was good as well we have watched it several times and will watch it again
5,One of our favorites,"We love this movie. Family friendly, great message about people and relationships but not so deep the kids won't like it."
2,Good for kids i guess,I thought this movie was boring. Might be good for kids t ough..... I would not recommend it to anybody.
1,"Good line up, big let down","There were some big names in this movie and it had such great potential but it was a big let down. They took it way too far in terms of animal and human interaction. I mean, bringing a guerrilla to TGIF and he ends up dancing with a girl and the girl whispers ""I'm so glad I met you!"" Come on!Definitely some funny parts, but overall I would pass on it. I don't know that it would even appeal to the younger crowd. I think Dr. Doolittle was better in terms of the storyline mixing animals and people."
2,Who's the target audience?,"1. Anytime there's a movie with talking animals, I get it because my kids tend to love those movies. I knew going into it that it was a PG movie and I can say that it is a PG movie. However, you have to wonder who these folks targeted the movie for... because it just misses on all levels. Most ""normal"" adults aren't going to enjoy this; it's not bad, but it's basically juvenile. Some scenes and episodic language isn't for those below Jr High... and those young kids are the ones that are typically going to watch talking animal movies.2. Bottomline, this movie could have been pretty good, if it just focused on one target audience; ie young kids and their parents and cleaned up the language / certain situations... but they didn't and as a result, this movie is already headed for the trash heap of has been films that will be lost to memory etc..."
2,Neither My Kids Or I Got Many Laughs Out of This,"Talking animals are usually a sure hit with my kids, and I generally like Kevin James and his affable humor. But we were just too bored with this one. James plays the zookeeper of the title, with serious romantic problems, and a zoo full of animals that he finds out can talk and decide to try and coach him through his romantic woes. There are a few funny moment - a favorite was when he takes the gorilla to TGI Fridays - but mostly it's just a bit too slow. Having the plot revolve around adult romantic issues also just didn't work - talking animal movies are usually skewed to a young crowd (my own are 5 and 7), but they just don't get some of the romance/mating related jokes. So unfortunately, I think this one was a miss."
4,My daughter loves these boots!,"Yes, these were for my daughter, not my son. LOL! She loves camoflauge for some reason and she loves wearing them whenever she can! I'm just glad I was able to get them so quickly and easily!"
2,So Cute! But they fell apart after a month's worth of use.,"I bought these for my 3 1/2 year old son, because he wanted army boots for Christmas. They came in an extremely cute little box, and seemed to be exactly what he wanted. He wore them for a month, (from Christmas Day almost to the end of January) and they have split on the side just above the sole. This means they are no longer waterproof and the split is getting bigger by the day. Too bad because I probably would have kept coming back to get other pairs. They are so cute.."
5,Perfect,"These boots were a gift for my 20 month old nephew, he loves them and can put them on by himself."
5,perfect,they are exactly what I was looking for. Too cute. they are perfect for my toddler. He loves the boots.
5,Love this product!,"With rainy season approaching, we bought these boots. Our son loves them and wears them during some heavy down pours."
2,I give up,"Western Chief has really cute boots, but they fall apart in a matter of a month or two. My son loved to tromp around in the backyard in these camo boots, but the rubber has split apart in so many places already that they are not longer water proof."
4,Good Buy but Run Big in Size,These boots are good quality boots but are at least a half size too big.
5,Adorable,I bought two pairs of these boots for my nephews and they were awesome. A great gift and everyone loved them. Very cute!!!
2,Extremely dull.,"""If Ever I Return Again"" felt like a very incomplete book. All the action was clumped at the end, at the end of a two-year voyage. To make it interesting, Celia should have drawn things on the letters she was sending to her cousin, Abigail - since she said she enjoyed drawing. The crewmembers were underdeveloped - we only heard about Mr. Grimes, Isaac, and Nate in great detail. Surely there must have been other men Celia conversed with on the ship, of interest? The relationship between Celia and her mother was very predictable and the mystery of Celia's father's first wife was not really a mystery. I wish there had been more colorful explanations of the ocean, whales, dolphins, the ship, and hurricane. I do not recommend."
4,Excellent learning tool for incoming 2nd graders,"My daughter is very interested in workbooks that teach her a variety of skills. This workbook is great; you can work at your own pace, you earn stickers and rewards as you go along, and it teaches reading as well as math skills, with lots of fun activities along the way. At the end, you earn stickers and rewards that eventually complete a certificate. IT's a great way to get ready for 2nd grade, and to use throughout the summer and school yr. too. SHe brings it along in the car and to her grandmothers and is very enthusiastic about learning because of it. I highly recommmend this and others in the ""Jumpstart"" Series of books and cd's."
1,Jumpstart 2nd Gr : Jumbo Workbook (Jumpstart),"I oredered this book on Aug. 5, 2005, but till now, Sep. 7, 2005 I didn't receive it. How can I write a review of this book?"
1,Hands Free Adapter Cumbersome,"Although the adapter works well after I modified it, it would be a lot better if the speaker was not part of the cigarette plug-in. It sticks out so far that it interferes with other car functions. The speaker should be separated so it can be mounted away from where the cigarette lighter is. In one of my vehicles, it sticks out where it is regularily kicked by someone in the passenger seat, and in my other car it sticks out so that I can not use the beverage holder. In my third vehicle, it interferes with my shift lever. I had to buy a cigarette lighter extension cord so I could lay the unit in my center console. Other manufacturers have designed much better adapters for their phones. If I had know this was what Qualcom (Kyocera)had, I would never have bought their phone. I live in NYS and hands free operation is required by law."
3,Monterey Jack,This is a great techno/dance to trance type CD. This is different for Monterey. I say it is a quality CD to buy. My favorite song was apperception by Manjaro.C
4,good but could be better,"having recently purchased the director deck chair I found it to be sturdy and of good quality however, I recently received a similar chair which was much more inexpensive and had more features to it including a side pocket for magazines, etc in addition to the side table with cup holder. The quality was good if not better than the more expensive chair at Amazon. I was told it was purchased at Sam's.I was also not too happy with the expensive shipping cost. $25.oo was in my opinion a little to high for shipping 1 chair."
1,TINY,This came after about 7 days and it is so small I cannot even fit my arm in! When will internet stores improve the return process. Now I have to take a trip to the post office and wait weeks for a refund! ugh
3,"Interesting, but the writing could use some major work","I certainly agree that Getting Even was an interesting look at revenge and it moral defensibility, and the book is worth a read if one doesn't have any other gripping texts lying around. However, I do whish the Barton had cut out some of the redundancy from text. One doesn't need to say the same thing five times in a row to get a simple point across. Also, better proof reading would have been nice (chapter four was esp. bad, IMHO)."
3,Far Too Academic--I Returned It,"I really tried to enjoy this book, but after about 45 minutes with it I realized that it was just too academic. I was exposed to much of this material in graduate school (back when the NTL Institute was just called National Training Laboratories), but I thought it might be useful in my consulting practice with government and military leaders. Unfortunately, it reads like any other book of readings about OD. I simply couldn't justify the expense of keeping a limited-value book on my shelf, so I returned it.Don't get me wrong; I love OD, Change Management, and Leadership--all subjects I teach. It's just that this is a stereotypical 300-400 level or graduate course book--a book of readings by various OD practitioners.There is far more usable and readable material out there."
5,NTL Handbook Review,An excellent compendium from the leaders in the field of Organizational Development. A fine reference.
1,Very disappointing....,"being a fan, I had never read Dodd's earlier work. Turns out, I wasn't missing anything. I loved the originality of a blind female and male, but the plot never went anywhere. William was entirely unlikeable, a flat character. Saura was equally so. I had to push myself through it, even through the very predictable ending, which was a big let-down. Don't waste your time!"
4,Classic Medieval Romance,"I love a good medieval romance and this one did not disappoint. The heroine being blind (and not helpless) was a great premise handled beautifully. The swoon-worthy hero is a mighty warrior who appreciates more than just her beauty. A side romance with a mature couple was fun, and appreciated. The writing could have been tighter; there were scenes that were nice but really did nothing to move the plot along. Forgivable, since I believe it's the author's debut book (first published over 20 years ago) and the story was overall a satisfying and entertaining read."
3,So-So.....,"I really enjoyed ""Castles In The Air"" by Christina Dodd and looked forward to reading this book. However, I wasn't very impressed. There were a few funny moments and the overall story was good but it didn't grab my attention. I finished the book but it was a slow read. Not a bad book but not a keeper, in my opinion."
2,I just couldnt get into it..,"I thought that this book had unbelievable potential, but I just couldnt like it no matter how much I wanted to. I absolutely loathed the characters.. I thought that Saura was annoying and William was such a pig I wanted to jump right into the book and belt him upside the head..needless to say, I did not finish this ..why waste time reading something I dont even like a little when there are so many amazing stories out there to be read??? I have many books by Ms. Dodd and I have enjoyed the majority of them..sadly, I cannot say the same for ""Candle in the Window"" This is not a book that I would recommend."
2,"Cute, but couldn't bring myself to finish it.","Well, normally I really love Christina Dodd's works, but this one just didn't do it for me. At all. Frequently the writing was choppy and distracting (a la Cathrine Coulter), and the story as a whole I just found weak. True, I loved the first 150 pages or so, when Saura first went to ""help"" William, but then he conveniently got his sight back and it all just went to pot. I'm very suprised too, because Christina is usually a much better writer than this.Though this wasn't enough to put me off this author entirely, I'll definately be checking to see whether the books I pick up in the future of hers are the early attempts or her better, later works. My advice, if you just HAVE to read all of C. Dodd's books, wait until this one shows up at your local library. Don't waste your money."
3,Candle in the Window,"I was not enthralled by this book. I read an advertisement for this book and felt like it would be a good read. But, upon reading the book I found it lacking and could actually put it down and skipped through to get to the ending."
4,This is great for general use,"We have been using this extensively while camping. We bought two, this one and a higher power one. One for each vehicle. We have been very happy with them. A word of caution however. If you use it for a long time (for days)and then don't drive anywhere you can end up surprised with a dead battery. Common sense usually prevents this. We camped for six months and were constantly charging various things.We hard wired this one in. We don't manually connect it every time. We wanted it permanent, but this power level did not come in a hard wire version. So we made it that way. It is nice to have a background in auto electronics :-)UPDATE: I just wanted to add the discovery of one annoyance. The outlets are too close together to plug two things in at once unless they are the slim old style plug. So you may need to use an extension cord or outlet strip to have more than one thing plugged in at a time. Other than that, this is still working just fine."
1,I was good while it lasted,I bought this item last august to run fans at an outdoor flea market. It worked great last year we used it until the end of september and put it up for the winter. When I tried to use it yesterday may 24th it no longer works. Will try customer service and see if they stand behind what they sell.
5,Pretty nice procduct,"I have purchased many of this item for some friends and I, and we all agree this work great you can run lot of AC things in your car. I've seen similar models but with this one you get quality for a low cost."
4,Lets talk about Tattling,This book maybe an old book but it is one of the best in the series. The pictures are wonderful. You should really buy or read this book. Very good.
2,disappointing,the concept is good but the game is boring. I purchased two and once i opened and played mine with my family. i returned the other one that i purchased as a gift. I had read a review in a magazine which enticed me to buy it......very disappointing.
5,A must play!,"This game is great for anyone who goes out and actually lives life. I'm not talking about true adventure seekers, I just mean if you get out of bed everyday, you should play this game! From learning how to protect yourself from a shark, to how to treat a burn or cut, this game is loaded with little tidbits that everyone should know if you ever find yourself in that ""worst-case scenario""---like I do, all of the time! I played with some friends, but I could see this being a great game for all ages."
3,Misplaced hyphen?,"It appears that the hyphen in the game's title has been misplaced: it should read ""Worst Case-Scenario Survival Game.""As many reviewers have commented, a lot of the ""answers"" are just plain wrong. The game is, however, rather entertaining, mostly because it gives you a chance to mock the bizarre wording of the questions and answers. If you are looking for serious survival information... or a challenging game experience... look elsewhere! If you enjoy goofing around while discussing piranha-infested rivers and electrical shock victims, this is the game for you."
1,Worst game ever,"I am a game collector, I have lots of them and love playing them. This is the worst game ever. Not only are most of the card question and answers stupid, but there are some that are plain wrong. Out of the small box of questions, (Dont let the size of the game fool you. It is mostly empty.) I found about 20 of them that seemes like fun questions. The rest were stupid. Like, ""How do you keep from being abducted by an alien?"" It is not a joke, it is serious! Dont waste your money. Unfortunatly the place where I bought it wouldn't let me return an opened game. That is the only reason I still have it. If you must buy it, buy mine, I don't want it!"
1,Bad game,"The questions and answers for this game are horrible. An example question, the one that finally made us pack up the game, asked something along the lines of:How do you keep someone from choking on their tongue?The 'correct' answer was to stick a needle or wire through the choking persons tongue and tie the wire to their shirt button.Gimme a break!In addition, as other's have mentioned, the board is very boring.A couple of the questions were slightly amusing, but most of them were just dumb. I love games of all types but this game was pretty oogy."
2,Poor design of cards ruins this game,"It seems like a fun game with interesting questions, but I found that I was very unhappy with the cards in the game. Let me explain...When you play Trivial Pursuit, part of the fun is when you are reading off the question to your opponent, that in your mind you try to think of what the answer would be. You flip the card and then you see the answer and think, ""oh I was right"" or ""oh I was wrong"" or ""oh they will never get this"".But with the Scenario Game, the card posts the question and three multiple choice answers all on one side. The correct answer is in bold. Now this is no fun to read the question, because you immediatley know the answer as you read it. There's no guessing for the question asker.Plus the board itself is a very boring start to finish game. Board games are much more interesting when you have to travel around the board many times."
1,Needs something more,"We got this game for our eight-year-old son and played it with him and his 9-year-old friend. The concept of the game is very simple - counters move around the board by correctly guessing the answer to a 'worst case scenario' question. The questions were difficult for the children. Some of the words were hard to read and the situations difficult to answer for children of this age group with their limited life experience. The most glaring problem, however, was the justification as to why that was the correct answer. Nowhere was that given. This would have given the game a much more interesting spin and made the trip round the board that much more worthwhile. It did give rise to some discussion but the answers were so esoteric that after a while we just gave up. We never did finish the game."
4,Unusual and fun,My husband and I had a ball playing this game. I think people take this game too seriously- it's just a game.
1,Ridiculous,">A completely original approach to learning how to create a manga comic.Sure it is original. A How-to-draw-manga book by two guys who can't draw manga (or anything) at all. The worst book on How-to I have seen by far.If you want to learn how to draw manga, you'd better use your money buying something like a hamburguer. You will learn the same but you won't be wasting your money."
1,"The funniest ""how to draw"" book","I don't know for sure who encourages people who can't draw to write books explaining their technique. So, I will have to blame the mothers of Mr. Gibson and Mr. Marcos for this travesty. Guys, I'm sure that between you, someone knows how to make the little stick figures, and someone knows how to sketch, and maybe someone knows how to draw the outlines around them. So when you started out on this book, you should have assigned those tasks to the author who was competent in that area! Just looking at the front cover of this book will give you a nice clue of how the authors draw manga. But please, don't look at it too long-- the wiggly outlines and misplaced eyeballs might be contagious!"
4,Just as described - great condition,Camcorder was bought for transfering Hi8 tapes to digital format. Worked great. Unfortunately no cables but no big deal. I should have asked. Very happy with transaction and speed of shipping.
3,Good camera for the price - but make sure you check specs,"I bought this camera slightly used in mint condition and I'm fairly impressed with it. The steadyshot function and nightshot are excellent features. However, I'm selling it, because you cannot take still shots, and it costs you an extra [money amount]for a media converter if you want to review/edit your videos on your computer. But, it is a good camera if you like watching home videos on your TV."
4,"Smells like a campfire, works like a charm","Remember finally noticing the scent of wood smoke on your clothes halfway home from a weekend of camping? I expected this soap to smell of pine, but the dark, resinous scent is more smoky than green. It is quite pleasant on the body, however, lending a slight woodsy edge.I've used it for three showers, and the combination of this soap and water a bit less hot are calming my itchies marvelously."
4,"love the soap, no one else does","I love this soap and I actually like the way it smells. But my main purpose in writing this review is because many others have claimed that the smell fades quickly and the co workers won't mind.I have to disagree with that. My girlfriend hates the smell but when I used it in the past, before going to work, my coworkers started to tell me that I smell and that I need a shower. Many thought it was BO. Now I theorize that these comments were made because my co-workers are idiots. I'm not saying you have to like the smell but I am saying that only an idiot would think that pine tar smells like body odor.""It smells like pine trees,"" fine. ""I don't like it,"" fine. ""You smell like you haven't showered in week,"" you're not that bright.Great soap, but be warned, others may have a problem with it even if you don't"
3,"Seems to work pretty good, smells like a campfire!","I got this product to help with my chronic hives. It seems to calm down the itching for a little while, and the soap is non-irritating and very mosturizing. It does, however, smell just like a campfire, not joking. Which is odd. However, once you wash it off, you don't notice it. I wouldn't call it a miracle soap, but a good natural soap."
4,"Makes me think of grilled fish, which is a good thing!","I'm still not sure what tar smells like, but this soap must smell like pine, because it makes me think of the fish that my uncles make on the grill, which is an awesome scent to take a shower with. As others have said, the smell is not too strong, and doesn't stick to the skin for a long time. It does leave a perfume in the bathroom for the rest of the day, but again, I enjoy the smell of burning wood in a grill.The company that I ordered this soap from is highly professional, and I wasn't happy with the condition that my soap arrived in, but they offered me a discount when I e-mailed them."
5,Amazing product!,"I remember my father using this many years ago, and I came across this soap searching for another product. I purchased it and have been using only a week and I am blown away. I have suffered with very dry skin and eczema for many years and this soap flat out works. I have tried every moisturizing bath gel and soap known to man. I am extremely pleased with the result. The scent is very strong, but personally I like it very much. My wife, not so much.Buy it if you have dry skin conditions and you will not be disappointed."
4,ooh ooh that smell,"Smells like a hobo and cleans like an angel! Loved by hippies and loggers for generations! I cannot say enough about grandpa's soap. It cleans very well, works as an amazing shampoo/conditioner (pine tar moisturizes as it conditions and strengthens leaving my hair shiny and manageable), shaving soap, and it has cleared up my itchy shin problem in less than a week!However, be forewarned, you, like the soap, will smell like a campfire loving hobo after standing around a burn barrel full of christmas trees."
3,Haha it smells awful!,Be prepared to smell like tar or smoke or something that's been outside for ages man! Yea I smelled it through the package and just chucked it! haha I was merely curious.
2,"May be good for your skin, but oh the smell","Most of use have been conditioned to expect fresh, minty, fruity or woodsy smells with bath or shower soap. So waking up in the morning to the smell of a poorly cleaned charcoal grill is challenging. I hesitate to describe this as a chimney smell, because most chimneys smell pleasantly faintly of wood. This smells like you're standing downwind of a barbeque grill restaurant.As a soap, it works well, and seems to clean adequately. But I won't be ordering it again."
4,I love this soap,I've used this soap for 30 years. Lathers great and smells very fresh. The smell is too strong for some but I love it. I enjoy nature and this soap acts as a cover scent allowing me to gain close proximity to wildlife without being noticed.
1,Soap smells horrendous,"I picked up 183 Pine Tar Soaps (4.25 Ounces) at a going out of business sale. I thought I was getting a good deal.Turns out the Soap smells horrendous and caused me to gag and itch all over when I used it on my [blank]. I had to toss all of them out.If you are prone to skin allergies or aroma allergies, don't get this one."
4,"This stuff is a little ""iffy"".","At first I didn't like it. By the time I got to the second bar, I started to like it. Now that the second bar is half gone, I like it even better. I had to replace the fire alarm in the hall because every time I came out of the bath room, it would go off, it was pretty old. This stuff smells like wet wood charcoal and railroad ties when your using it, but after your done it just smells clean. It doesn't leave a film that I've noticed and feels quite refreshing. I haven't found a wood tick since I started using it even though I bashed around in the brush several days. The only real complaint I have is, it goes away a little faster than Dial and the price is a bit high. Like I said, it's a little ""iffy"". You won't know for sure until you try it."
5,Best bar soap ever.,"I have been using Grandpa's Pine Tar soap for years, after one use I was in love. I know the scent is STRONG, but I really like it. Some people think it smells bad, but that's just because we are used to our skin-care and everything else smelling like tropical fruits or cucumbers or flowers. This soap smells real. And I love it. My skin loves too!"
3,If you like Bacon...,"Than this soap is for you! Seriously smells like some sort of bacon or beef jerky. Great for skin problems like eczema or acne though. If you can get past that initial cured, smoked camp fire/bacon/jerky smell!"
3,Still looking...,"I gave this one a fair shot, despite the smell. It's not bad, just strong and weird. Within two minutes after taking it out of the box, it permeated the entire bathroom. I used it anyway and, honestly, I was a bit glad that it leaves my skin very dry. Tried it for shampoo too, same result."
2,If you can get past the smell,"If you can get past the smell of this product I'm sure that you will love it. The one time that I did use the product it cleaned well and left a clean feeling. However I never smelled clean. Some reviewers say that the product smelled like a lumber yard; another reviewer claims that it smells like a campfire. Unfortunately my experience was much worse, it smelled like a pine tree puked or smells like someone was burning plastic in a campfire. What makes it worse is that I smelled like that all day. Not just a few hours but all way time until I was able to take another shower.I recommend this product only if you like exotic smells."
3,stinky!,"this wasn't some miracle treatment for me, just a really stinky soap. i don't have psoriasis or anything like that but i do have dry itchy skin and i guess it helped, a little. i mostly wanted to see if it would help clear up some of my acne because some people say it helped with that but it didn't for me. i won't be purchasing this again and i don't like coming out of the shower feeling stinker than when i went in lol"
5,Has helped,"I have psoriasis. This has helped keep new spots from breaking out. I had bad itching, using this I'm good till my next shower.The smell at first took some getting used to. Not on me, just the bar of soap sitting there. After a couple of uses that subsided.I'll be buying more."
2,Not a shaving soap!,"As others have said, this is not a shaving soap. I figured it'd be worth trying, in spite of the warnings... But no. Don't. The lather is very thin and by the time you're done putting down your brush and picking up your razor, the soap is already drying up. I tried re-milling it as another reviewer mentioned, but it didn't help me at all.I'm sticking with Colonel Conk's for shaving. It's fairly priced and does the job much better.Now, I really do like the scent of this soap, and I'll continue using it as a general face soap (I already bought it, right?), but it is NOT a shaving soap and should not be advertised as one."
2,"Tried 3 weeks for psoriasis, negligible results","After reading the other reviews, I had high hopes that Grandpa's Pine Tar soap would help with my psoriasis, but after using almost daily for 3 weeks, I can't say it helped all that much if any at all. If anything I would say that the soap leaves the skin feeling dry, and I found myself using more lotion to compensate, but would still end up itchy towards the end of the day. Psoriasis is a weird thing though, so you may have better results.Like the other reviews note, the odor is very strong and takes some getting use to, but it is not entirely offensive either. Kinda manly actually, and not too dissimilar from the smell of coal tar shampoo."
4,Bad smell but it works1,I am pregnant and I got this soap because I heard it works for acne.The smell is bad but after a couple of uses it hardly seems noticeable.I used this twice a day and I have seen an improvement. I have only been using this for about two weeks.
3,"Sleek, compact, but a little irritating...","This is my first bluetooth headset, and I bought it because of price and design. Both are still good reasons, but the piece that fits in your ear (like headphones) can slip out sometimes, especially if I'm wearing sunglasses. I've experienced fantastic sound quality, and it's charge held much longer than I expected. I've never had anyone ask if I was on a headset, which tells me that it has a great microphone too. Overall, I am very satisfied with this headset, especially that it matches my white phone!"
1,Nokia is irresponsible when it comes to spare parts,"There's one perfectly good reason not to buy this product -- Nokia irresponsibly refuses to carry spare parts. If you lose the rubber earbud, you can just throw the entire product into the garbage, because they don't carry spares, and no one makes them. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT or any other Nokia product that is as poorly designed as this one."
1,Another version of old lies,"Certain people have been filling the world with the lies about the history and Armenian Genocide,So far, no one has ever put a credible proof of what they claim have happened.This issue has highly been politicized and being used as a tool to apply pressure to Turkish government. I am sure many other books can be written in the same tone depicting the agony of the people who suffered during those times from Armenian violence against Ottomon subjects.Most of the reviews I see are a continuation of such attitute by which no real evidence can be shown other than emotional expressions.My suggestion is do not buy into these kinds of arguments."
1,"avoid this boot, get the legit release","this is a poor quality bootleg, buy the legit, remastered version:Five Element Ninjas (Shaw Brothers)"
3,Bootleg,Celestial has finally remastered this movie so there is no reason to buy this Red Sun bootleg. The picture quality is horrible and the DVD freezes up like many other Red Sun discs. So make sure to get the region 3 IVL version.5 stars for the movie. 0 stars for this DVD.
2,"Some Good, Mostly Bad","The belt drive and sssembly structure are adequate for the price. It cuts straight IF you throw away the ultra-crappy fence. It is made from totally substandard guage aluminum ( a couple of steps ubove Alcoa Oven Foil) and bows out at the center when clamped in position. I use the fence off the Craftsman 10"" that I replaced with the JET. The miter jig is so loose in the slot that it cannot be trusted. It is a quick-and-dirty-use saw. There is no zero clearance blade slot so don't try cutting small. I wish I spent the extra bucks on a Bosch or maybe even a higher model of Jet"
5,Jet Portable Table Saw,"I very happy with this purchase. Can't beat it for the price. I got it for under $200 including shipping. Like the extensions on right and back and flexibility to move rear extension to left side. Needs tweaking in the beginning, but still a great deal."
5,Jet tablesaw - Best for the price!,"As a home-business owner, I have some pretty big concerns in my budget and do my research for tools. I owned a $100 tablesaw I bought from the hardware store, and have had problems with the blades / spindle not cutting accurately. After going to all the hardware stores in the area, I found the problem was the same with all saws in the class. The direct-drive saws present issues keeping the blades rigid. This tablesaw from Jet was the only one with a belt-drive, that took the tension off the motor spindle allowing it to remain rigid and reduce viabration. It is also supported by all the accessories that Jet sells that are compatible with it. For the price, in its class - it is the best, simply because it uses the v-belt design on the spindle."
2,Yes the price is right but wouldn't reccommend.,Even with a vac attached it is the messiest table saw I've ever used. It can scatter dust all over my shop. There is no zero clearence table insert. Buy a saw with a cast iron table top. Spend a little more and get a better saw...
4,Good saw for the price,"After reading all of the reviews, I still wanted this belt driven saw.The mitre gauge and rip fence were better than I expected after reading the reviews.The mitre gauge and rip fence are about the same as you would find on any other saw at this price. I have a craftsman rip fence that works well on this Jet. The Jet is alot smother running and quiter than most other saws at this price. The belt drive dosen't have as much vibration as other saws have. I am very pleased with this saw."
4,Great value,I really like my new saw. It replaced a Sear's table saw that gave up the ghost and was almost impossible to repair.The belt drive convinced me to purchase this unit and I haven't been dissapointed. I have been able to cut almost anything without hesitation.My only regret is that it didn't come with a stand and I had to adapt my old Sears table to fit it.
3,"Jet 708315BTC 10"" Benchtop Table Saw","Jet is a good name and I have several Jet products, but this one has an alignment problem of about 2 degrees. Cannot get the saw blade to align up. Would recommend an upgrade versus this one."
2,so-so table saw,"I bought this saw for the belt drive feature. I wanted to try a belt driven table saw, and although I find this feature helps with noise and blade vibration, the rest of the saw's design leaves me disappointed. First off, all these other guys that complain about the fence and miter guage being sloppy are absolutely right. Even at full adjustment, the fence will easily lock in at 1/4 "" out of square. Also, every peice of hardware on this saw just feels cheap. From the blade depth adjustment knob to the lockdown screws to even the on/off switch, each component simply feels like just another made in China cheap part. I am a fan of JET industrial equipment; this saw however is just borderline acceptable. I will not brag about owning this saw, and if my wife wasn't pushing me to install a hardwood floor in our house, I would DEFINATELY send it back and get a Bosch for double the price of the JET. I have used the Bosch and it is definately twice as nice."
1,Ok while it lasted,"Motor burned up and seized after 2 years of very cared for moderate use. Mainly building custom speaker boxes out of MDF...and a very good blade, not the one that comes with it. Nice while it lasted."
3,disappointed . . . .,"Its a very small book, about the size of a PDA or a small address book. It has space inside to write very few details about any given wine. This book is not big enough to paste a wine label inside. I could picture myself using this book in a restaurant to quickly jot down the wine I had, but thats really about it."
4,Inner Compass : An Invitation to Ignatian Spirituality,"If you are looking to deepen your spiritual life and do some ""Soul Care"" for yourself, this is good place to begin.Spiritual Exercises are sprinkled throughout this book by Margaret Silf. Exercises such as: Finding God in all things, Discovering who I really am, Noticing God's action in my life, and Making choices in line with my truest self.The title 'Inner Compass' rings true as the author guides you through introspective exercises and spiritual disciplines which can't help but leave you closer to the Father's heart."
4,Sorry to destroy the 5 star rating....,"If you are thinking about getting Tristeza's A Colores then hear is a simple two song test for you.First listen to, Balabaristas when that is done listen to, Liquid Pyramids all the way through. (The actual songs not the Amazon clips)If you get through those songs and still have a smile on your face, then A Colores as a whole cd would definatly be worth the investment.Plus the album artwork is radNow MY reasoning behind four stars...1. A fourth of this cd goes no where and has no direction2. Some of the songs could have cut and added minutes in either direction and been much more bearable.3. Tristeza likes to take classical music riffs and turn them into beautiful melodies, this is really hard to get through sometimes.4. While the cd as a whole is much better than the previous releases, for the musical ability that the band actually has I feel as if most of this cd is just a medicore take of what could have been jaw dropping."
5,From the grandfathers of ergonomics,"This is an excellent introductory review of ergonomics, written by two of the recognised top authorities in this field of study. It is a strongly recommended starting point for students seeking to orientate themselves in ergonomic science."
1,quality below expectation,"I bought a few bags of this product, but I was quite disappointed by the quality. I found most of the cork pieces have very significant cracks/holes on them, and in some cases, the crack goes through from side to side. Only a few of the pieces are usable. Perhaps, the manufacturer needs to look at quality control more closely."
4,Perfect Fits,"I found two corks for some oddball bottles I had, completely worth it - great moderate quality cork and I love AMAZON PRIME!"
2,Poor workmanship,"The watch itself may have been OK, but right away we noticed the band was poorly made. The edges of the links were not completely covered with stainless steel, & were partially open. We are returning the watch for a refund."
2,truly stoopid,"I love Greek mythology and enjoy many modern treatments thereof. For instance, I loved Atwood's Penelopiad and the Lost Tales of Odysseus. Since this book was from the same series, I thought I'd try it, but boy what a waste of time. First, I read thousand-page books all the time, so I thought I'd finish her sparse 100 pages in about an hour. But it is so boring and stupifying, it took me 5 days. Every time I'd open it, I'd fall asleep. Sadly, the author seems very impressed w/her own wit & insight, since she repeats her 3 favorite sentences over & over, like a verbal tic when she's thinking of something not totally banal to say. Also, while I am not particularly prudish, it is just stupid to suggest that Hercules's primary contribution to Atlas was offering to masturbate him(!). Why is this funny, or insightful, or witty? Its just dumb. As is such soft-brained lola-granola epiphanies as ""your first parent was a star."" Total waste of time, watch paint dry instead."
3,hmmm...indifferent,"After reading Grossman's amazing 'Lion's honey', I couldn't wait to get my hands on another book in the 'Myths' series.Winterson's 'Weight' was, well...anticlimactic. It certainly wasn't bad, some passages concerning Altas' contempalions were even interesting, and the ending was rather sweet. But all in all, this book left me indifferent.Heracles (Hercules) had a pretty big part in the story, but being a both unlikable and uninteresting character (a quite amazing feat), I had to resist the urge to skip his part.The gods were little more than props, and Atlas himself was just this side of a zombie. An intelligent one perhaps, but just too mellow.Maybe check this book out in your local library before buying it."
3,Confusion?,"Perhaps I'm confused. Isn't the author conflating 2 different Atlases? As far as I know, there are 2 Atlases in Greek myth. One is one of the sons of Poseidon & Clito. He later ruled Atlantis and gave his name to that unfortunate continent/island. The other Atlas was a Titan and according to the most cited tradition was one of the sons of Iapetus and Clymene. A less cited tradition makes Atlas the son of Uranus. In any case, according to the most cited tradition, Atlas the Titan is not the son of Poseidon, but rather Poseidon is Atlas' (the Titan's) cousin. In addition, in neither tradition is Gaia an immediate parent. If I'm really not confused & Ms. Winterson is actually 1) changing Atlas' parents and 2) conflating the two Atlases to make a point, I think she should have brought this point into her otherwise interesting, absorbing and thought provoking retelling and interpretation of this important myth (relating to Atlas the Titan)."
1,"No plot, no story. Great for hipsters, junk for everyone else.","I picked up this book randomly at the library, without having heard anything about it. The concept seemed interesting. I never would've thought how pointless this book would turn out to be.The plot is a threadbare account of Atlas holding up the universe while his buddy Heracles masturbates and kills people. Insert some pointless drivel about an orphan in the modern world, mix with some ""stylish"" writing gimmicks (such as repeating the phrase, ""I want to tell the story again"") and you have Weight.I haven't read the other reviews of this book yet, but I'm awed that it has such a high star-rating. My guess is that people will give the usual hipster garbage reasons, like, ""Oh, you just don't GET IT."" Sorry, but I'm too clever for that line. This books sucks, the end."
1,Bad book,I'm sorry I love Greek mythology and this is just a mockery of it. This author inserts upsetting almost pornographic imagery like when she included how Heracles masturbated over his step mother and touched her nipples. These images are not the only thing wrong with this book. The author almost beats you over the head about her obvious feelings on her future. My issue isnt with her view point but the fact that by flat out telling the reader it robs the story of any depth. This is just a bad book dont waste your money or time.
2,good tips mixed in with shots of topless guys,"The video is 30 minutes. In those 30 minutes, there are maybe 7 minutes of worthwhile advice and instruction; the other 20+ are a bunch of gargabe. Most of it sounds like an ad for the Nick B. tennis academy, and there are way too many shots of one of his students, xavier malisses, hitting forehands w/ no shirt on."
3,Would like to see this video remade,"Will give three stars. Video incorporates goofy scientist character which might be entertaining for children < 16 years age, but annoying to me. Wish that the video had some commentary directed at the novice player to emphasize basics regarding swing mechanics and creation of low-to-high swing pattern with topspin. Overall, the Bollistic Backhand video in this instructional series did much better job taking time to explain the backhand swing, and this video on the forehand is not quite of the same quality."
3,"3 1/2* Dated Material, But Still Good","This is a very good, albeit fairly old (1983) look at amusement parks, and, especially, the mechanics, painters, maintenance staff, gardeners, cooks, costume designers, and security personnel who work there. The last section ""Working There,"" briefly talks about teen and professional employment.There isn't very much on the art and architecture of rides; the book is written at a more macro level describing the staff needed to run a park. Additionally, most featured parks are in California, and they are described fairly briefly. Still, the text is well written, there are some fascinating facts (e.g., two 450-horsepower pumps get water speeds up to 30 miles an hour at California's ""Magic Mountain""), and some nice color and black and white photos. I think it may be best as a book to read to youngsters; those who can read may want something a little more technical and up-to-date."
2,Pyrex dish,"The quality is great but the size is completely wrong. It is not 14.2 inches, more like 6 inches. So if you are looking for something smaller then this is fine. Not happy at all about the misleading sizes."
4,Great Okinawan music similars to Nenes,"This is great music. In the vein of the Nenes or Shoukichi Kina (and if you don't know who there are, well my sympathies, you are missing some wonderful music). Like the Nenes, the Rinken Band combines traditional Okinawan music with more contemporary sounds resulting in a very nice mix. Haku rates it 4 stars!"
4,Beneath The Snows of Stalingrad,"Many years ago, I becme the owner of Frank's Etched in Purple followed by The Wyandot. The latest ""Beneath the Snows of Stlingrad"" still exceeds the early books.Having had the experience of combat in winter conditions, I marvel at the detail Frank writes. He also had combat experience in winter conditions and it is evident in his book.The detail he picks up is the greatest. One can feel the total despair of the fighting men. He underlines the old statement the ""war is hell"".Frank also brought out the conditions on the home front where those left to do the farming were old men and women.The love story had to be a story that was often repeated in those times.I highly recommend this book as a history lesson."
5,Excellent camcorder great buy,"My son just bought this camera a short while ago and he just can't stop admiring it...Neither can his friends. This camcorder comes with plenty of features including steadyshot, 560x digital zoom and 20x optical zoom. Even though the battery it comes with is for two hours only, it suits him just fine. He has taken many shots and loved them all. The effects are neat:sephia, pastel, negative art, black&white, solarize, mosaic, slim, stretch. The sephia is my favorite and reminds me what old movies looked like. There are also many fades to choose from. Sony really has put a lot of work into this camera. I really suggest you buy it if your looking for a high-quality, moderatly priced camcorder."
1,clean dishes before washing,"Well, trouble with this machine is that it lacks power to clean foods off the dirty dishes. If anything is on the top rack...forget it as there is only a sprayer arm on the bottom. Even with rinse agent our dishes are alway spotty no matter how much or little detergent we use and we do not live in an area with hard water so that is not it either. This machine came with the new construction of our house and we can't wait to replace it. The house we moved from had a real nice one that was stainless inside, had top and bottom arms and never had issues with pulling dishes out and seeing crusted on food scum."
2,Wears out real quick,"I bought this blade for my milwaukee v28 metal cutting saw. The first couple of cuts on 1/8"" metal were real nice, no sparks, just metal files that dropped to the ground. After a few more cuts, the blade starting making sparks as it cut, which it isn't supposed to do, as it's a ""cold cut"" blade. These sparks have made the transparent plastic on the saw almost impossible to see through. Now whenever I cut with this blade, I just get a lot of sparks, which I was trying to avoid by not going the abrasive blade route. Needless to say, I'm dissapointed in this blade. For $40, you expect more than just a handful of quality cuts on 1/8"" mild steel."
3,Life expectancy is Questionable...,"I used it to cut approx 30 lineal feet of 1/8"" steel plate.after which the blade was no longer cutting well.Initially it cut very good/surprisingly good.But dulled..Perhaps cutting sheet steel under 1/16 this blade may last a long time.I would have liked the manufacturer to have put an approx lineal foot expectancyfor different metal thickness's I probally wouldn't have cut 30ft of 1/8"" platefor 30 dollars.= cost of blade.I also used a wormgear saw, wouldn't use a nice saw because of the vibration ."
3,Not the right CD,"I wanted to buy the Jeff Boyle Band's CD, ""3"" but what I got was something called ""Here Comes the Rock Star Club"". Beware. The picture is of Boyle's CD but as you can see under the Artist name, it lists both ""Rock Star Club"" and ""Jeff Boyle Band"". When you click on the mp3 link, you'll see that it isn't at all the product that's pictured.It's only available from third party sellers, so make sure that what you're ordering here is what you want."
3,"Not bad, but in places unintentionally funny.","Like many futuristic tales (from Sinclair Lewis It Can't Happen Here to Margaret Attwood's The Handmaid's Tale), this book creates a plausible future for the time of publication but one which grows dated as time passes. In the end, we learn more about the author's prejudices than about the future. Aikman clearly believed the worst about American left-wing politics (his depiction of two ""mainstream"" reporters and a cabinet meeting composed of factions of the looney left are hilarious, probably unintentionally). He's better when he deals with his heroes and his main Russian villain (though he verges on parody here as well). So we get an enjoyable thriller but not one to take too seriously. Although his prediction of America's fall starting with an economic collapse and a disastrous pre-emptive strike in the Persian Gulf is starting to look credible. But the danger is more from the American right, than left."
3,TANKS! series repeated,"The commentaries in this are the same from the TANKS! Kursk and BArbarossa series and repeat themselves in this expanded series, Scorched Earth. This film is basically a quick overview of WWII battles with a few shots of tanks at the Bovington museum. I would recommend the older TANKS! series over this."
3,"Good, but poorly formatted.","I am convinced that the author left no stone unturned when it came to researching this book.There is, sadly, a problem: Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING, to the smallest detail) he ever learned about the Wisconsin River's natural and social history is shared with the reader; however, the information is presented very ineffectually due to poor formatting. Moreover, the facts regarding the Wisconsin River are all there, but instead of bringing her rich history to life it is merely documented in an oh-so-dry manner.That being said, the book is a very good reference source and deserves three stars for that reason alone."
2,THIS IS THE SECOND ONE IN A YEAR,WE HAD ONE OF THE OLDER MODELS FOR YEARS AND NOW WE HAVE HAD 2 IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS BOTH OF THEM HAD BEARING PROBLEMS....NOT AS GOOD AS THE OLD ONE IT LASTED 10 YEARS...
5,A must buy!,"I think this CD would compliment any music collection. I am especially fond of the song ""Call of the Shofar"" played by a regional university's trombone quartet nestled in the foothills of the Appalachain Mountains. You should check it out."
5,Want to be a High Roller?,"This game gives you the chance to be your own Donald Trump. It is a game of skill, thinking and chance. Fun for adults to play, usually takes about 1 1/2 hours and makes you want to play again and again. Buy stocks, start your own hotel chains and make takeover moves to make big bucks. Be smart with your money, watch what others are doing and be ready to monopolize on takeover moves and you will do well."
5,One of the Best of All Time,"This is a great game and works best for 4-6 players. Turns pass quickly, and tension is high. The rules are short and easy enough to learn. It has great replayability because the board is different in every game. I have introduced many people to the game, and the positive response is universal. Highly, highly recommended. A classic."
2,Legends of Folk: The Village Scene,"This is just an assembly of old video clips which can mostly be found elsewhere. There are no surprises included, and some suprising omissions. Noel Paul Stookey should think twice before doing another one of these. Not recommended."
2,ambient humidity is KEY,works in dry low humidity places like the west coast.DOES NOT work in high humidity places like the east coast or South East Asia.
2,"Good Company, not so cool product","I live in S.CA..now...and while I was not expecting a freezer.I was expecting, some cooling..The product has gone down in price, but still it cooled me no more than a ice pack wrap on the neck would..Then it broke, a month after having it..Its not worth even the lower price it now has, and its to bad for Sharper Image has quality stuff, this is not one of them..Save your money.."
2,Doesn't quite work as advertised,"I live in Florida. Inside it works like a champ, matter of fact it's cold. Outside though, it didn't do that well. Someone here mentioned humidity being a key to its performance. I tend to agree with that. I noticed a slight difference outside and in my shop, but not enough to justify wearing it. I might run my dehumidifier in the shop and try it again."
1,Does not work,"I should have listened to the other reviewers, which I usually do. I followed the directions to the letter. Put it on in 95+ degree weather and never felt cool at all. In fact, after several minutes I actually felt hotter and was sweating as much as without this thing on. Even if it had worked, it was very uncomfortable. I am suprised that Sharper Image sells such a bad product."
3,Too Bulky,"Although this item does cool, it is a little bulky around my neck and thus a little irritating to my neck."
2,waste of money !,I live in New York City where the temperatures and humidity are high. All this does is make your neck feel cold. I was still sweating after an hour! Try it if you want. The Sharper Image has a money back guarantee for 60 days. I dont know about Amazon.
1,no option for zero stars?,"I have read some reviews that say people's expectations are just too high. I work in an office that is usually between 75-80 degrees. I just wanted something to help lower my body temperature a few degrees. This thing is a complete piece of garbage. The fan is a joke. It doesn't do any cooling at all. You can't even feel the fan it's so weak. This thing isn't worth the material it's made of. This is the only thing I've ever bought from sharper image. Needless to say I won't be buying from them again. This thing won't even make you feel a couple degrees cooler in a 75 degree low humidity office. If it doesn't work in that situation, then what situation does it need?"
1,Junk - Don't waste your time or money,"Sharper Image strikes again.I have purchased 3 different items from Sharper Image and have returned all of them. There won't be a fourth time.Sharper Image sells junk.I thought the idea of a ""personal cooling system"" sounded good, and in the picture the device looks cool. But it just doesn't work. I took it on vacation to a hot climate, tried it out and felt nothing. Had to lug it around in my backpack the rest of the trip just to return it when I got home.Buy it and you'll return it too.Don't waste your time or money on this or any other Sharper Image products."
1,Personal Cooling System,"I was satisfied with the price, shipping, and communications. The idea behind the product is ingenious, and the design, engineering, and quality of finish is very good. Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well."
3,Good but not great,"Informative reference but could be much better. A bit thin in places. The Hawaii section is very oddly placed in the book and omits quite a number of words, as does the section on Southern speech. Perhaps the second or third edition will be much improved. Anyhow, this reference definitely fills a need in the world of dictionaries."
3,Not What I Expected,"This is a nice CD but if you think you are going to hear just Glady Knight, you will be dissapointed. It's mostly other artist singing songs on the CD. I think Glady performs 2 songs."
2,Gospel by Gladys Knight,"After watching (more times than I can count) ""I CAN DO BAD ALL BY MYSELF"" by Tyler Perry, I saught out to find any recent gospel by Gladys Knight since no soundtrack was going to be produced from movie. Gladys Knight has such a powerful voice and really added a significant level of quality to the entire movie and I found this cd, reviewed the information, and purchased it believing I'd hear more Southern style gospel like CeeCee and Marvin Winans, Pattie LaBelle, & Mariah Carey have produced. I was so disappointed that the music was much different, lacked her presence at all on some of the tracks, and overall didn't do her any justice she's so deserving of as a Christian Worldwide adored artist."
1,Very disappointed- Where's Gladys???,"They should have named this CD ""NO VOICE"" because thats about how much you hear of Gladys. Very very disappointed. Gladys shows up a few times during the whole CD. Her name should not even be on the cover. This is one of the slowest, most tiring albums I have ever heard."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I actually purchased the CD because it was ""Gladys Knight"" and gospel music, but prior to opening it I decided to listen to the sample tracks and check out the reviews. Boy am I glad that I did! I really thought that Gladys was the featured artist on the whole CD, not so, she is only singing on a few of the tracks. I liked a few of the selections but not enough to keep the CD. Since the CD has not been opened, looks like this one will be going back to the store. Sorry Gladys. I also heard that Kurt Karr produced this one, so now I'm really dissappointed!"
4,I just enjoy it,"Well, I have bought the record two weeks ago and I like it pretty much. It is not exactly what I expected but the surprise whas very good. You may be surprised by the changes in the rhythms. Quiet melodies followed by real gospel music. It makes it not bothering. Words are simple but touching. The duos between the choir and Gladys makes it very enjoyable. I particularly enjoy ""Love one another"" and ""He's worthy"". Good music, indeed!"
2,I think this CD is a bit of a ripoff.,"I was really excited about getting this CD, loving Gladys and gospel music the way I do. But I think that it should be made clear that Gladys only appears on 5 of the albums 15 tracks. A couple of them she only makes glancing appearances on and only really sings 3 songs--and one of them is a duet. This is NOT a Gladys Knight CD--it is a passable gospel choir CD with a special guest appearance by Gladys Knight."
2,Ho-Hum.,"Given Scarlet Rivera's performance pedigree (Bob Dylan, Keb' Mo', David Johansen and Tracey Chapman, among others), I had expected this disk to bring something distinctive to these old favorite tunes--a fresh arrangement, some tasty, well-constructed solos. Alas, the CD is a straightforward reading, throughout which Ms. Rivera essentially sticks to playing the melody line. It is not a bad CD, but I think it's better suited to playing unobtrusively in the background than it is to ""active listening."""
3,**yawns** Did i miss the Mansion party?,"Hmm.. .For a book whose title speaks of the Playboy mansion, you'd think it'd play a bigger role but it really doesn't.. Its mostly about her choosing her dad's carefree and drug induced lifestyle rather than having to abide by her mothers rules.. I think this book could have easily been written in 3 or 4 chapters.. In every chapter theres endless counts of what music was playing and what it changed to and what designer every piece of her wardrobe was made by and all her friends.. It was pretty irritating though i'm into that stuff myself.. Its a book not a fashion magazine.. So it was pretty poorly written and is basically about her making a million bad decisions but never making right with anything, just grinning and baring it so she can keep her little Mercedes and black card and not have to go to mom's ""poverty stricken"" lifestyle of still few boundaries..."
3,Very Disturbing Story,"This is a very disturbing story. It could have dug in deeper into the story line. But, It did give you a idea of what she was dealing with. It really sad that she got into drugs and having sex at such a young age. It is sad & disturbing that she didn't really have parental support. That she was able to do the things that she did. When I got done, I didn't really learn anything new. Just that this little girl was able to have this terrible life."
1,Sad story...even sadder storytelling,"You can't help but be sad about this autobiography... but I couldn't tell if it was the story or the writing. If you love books about random name dropping (without any real reason why) then this book is for you. I was expecting a bit more substance but realized 1/4 through the book that all I was getting was a shallow story of how a young girl received every material item she'd ever want and searching to fullfil the longing for the 'mom' she never had.All I ask if she give me some of her prescription meds to calm my anger of spending money on this garbage. Save your money, time, and anger...this book has a good story, but the author completely misses on any anticipated moral takeaways that you are led to believe will surface."
1,No soul.,"Other reviews have stated negatives about this book which explains much of why it doesn't work. There are no photos, nothing enlightening - nothing unique unless the reader doesn't know who Hugh Hefner is or what he's been doing for decades. Any compassion initially felt for the author as a child becomes overshadowed by her focus on shallow sensationlism. She clearly still has a love-hate problem going with ""Hef"", her parents, herself, her sister. The gist of the story is told in the first few chapters and what follows is indulgent reminiscing where one wishes the author had, instead, invested even half as much time in improving her writing style as she does in focusing on clothing labels. The complaining and finger pointing got exasperating. It's a book that shouldn't have been written because the author didn't really commit herself to a true expose' or personal growth. Not that the reader can see anyway."
2,The Playground wasn't Playboy Mansion,"The title of the book was a bit misleading. The Playboy Mansion was only mentioned in about 10% of the book, and it was not the part of the book where everyone was having most of the wild parties. It was the part where she sought refuge from the crummy life she was living with her father, who was Hugh Hefner's doctor. Her father was a mess.The rest of the book was repetitious- how many times can you tell about parties which all sound the same-- sex, drugs, more sex, etc. Actually, since she was so young, the whole book was pathetic and pitiful. What a life for a teenager. This book is very sad."
3,Horribly Written but Sinfully Decadent,"While this was one of the most poorly written books I have read in a while (typos, spelling errors, grammatical issues, diction choices that made my jaw drop, they were so wrong!), I enjoyed this glimpse into a world I know little about. The story's setting promises interesting and frequent glimpses into a world filled with sex, fashion, and drugs -- and it definitely delivers! If you are looking for a light read that is sinfully pleasurable but nothing to write home about, enjoy.Finally, you can tell that while Saginor is not an excellent writer (and her editor -- was there even an editor?!? -- was not an excellent one) this book must have been extremely cathartic for her. Kudos to her for being able to put to paper the stories of a childhood that obviously had (and seem to still have) such a harsh effect on her. I do hope that writing this memoir served as an emotional release for her."
2,Rather Disappointing,"I was rather disappointed by this book. I was expecting it to be about a childhood spent living at the Playboy Mansion, but it was really more focused on the drugs she used, who she slept with, and naming as many famous people as she could. You learn a lot about her highly dysfunctional family, but there are a lot of better memoirs to be read if that's what you're interested in."
5,A fun glimpse inside the mansion world,"Althought this book is about a girl who ""grows up"" at the mansion, it is more of a story of how poor parenting combined with a playboy mansion type environment can have a lasting impact on the development of a young girl.Yes, you will get a taste of what life and times are like at the mansion, but this is far from a documentary on the playboy mansion.Yes, this book could be added to the pile of cliche ""look at me I had a rough childhood and survived..."" books that are out there, but due to the excitement that comes with having Hef and a few playmates included every few pages this book is far from a cliche and is an enjoyable read for someone looking to enjoy a story about a girl who got to see inside the walls of a place most only imagine of ever visiting.This book is also well written and does a good job of keeping you excited and wanting to read more. Great job Jennifer, and thanks for sharing your story. I enjoyed it."
2,"Totally boring, self-pity","This book is boring. The portions of the book about the Playboy Mansion and the use-and-abuse of young models are interesting, if only because they're relevant touchstones of America's historical popular culture. The rest of this book is a drearily uncompelling airing of the Saginor's family's dirty laundry."
1,Human Degradation,"There is not enough water in the world to wash away the stench of human degradation from the individuals portrayed in this book, including the author. Don't waste your money on this drivel."
3,Underwhelming,"This book was underwhelming for 2 reasons.#1. No pictures. ""Childhood Lost"" is the kind of memoir that cries out for an 8-page photo insert. Let's see the author at 6 years old when she starts her book. Along with some shots of the masterful dad she talks so much about. And a picture of the Playboy mansion, where she spent so much time. And the group shot of those bunnies she spreads over so many pages. Where is ANYTHING more visual than the printed page? To help make this book real.#2. How about bringing it up to date? Published in 2005, ""Lost"" is not at all current, at least not according to the internet where one can find that Dr. Dad lost his doctor's license, and his 40-year-or-so friendship with Hugh Hefner, over an incident involving something sexual with a young girl. Would have made a colorful chapter,But no. Not mentioned.Is Jennifer waiting for book 2?"
1,This book is a perfect example....,"...of the phrase, ""the banality of evil"": poorly written, about stupid people, and with no insight.Worst of all, the author fails to consider the real source of her problems: herself.I, also, would give it a zero of I could."
3,Pyrex storage 3-cup rectangular dish,"I like the fact that I can put it in a microwave and it doesn't stain. I prefer rectangular containers because they use space in my rather small refrigerator more efficiently. I wish it was a little deeper with the width and length the same. When I bought it in February, Amazon didn't give its dimensions with the product description. Now (May 16, 2009) I'm editing my original review because Amazon says it is 12.2 x 8 x 5.8 inches. This is false; perhaps those are the dimensions of the box used for shipping. Embedded in the glass, it says ""3 cup - 750 ml, 7 x 5 x 1.5 in"", which is far smaller than Amazon says. Amazon's error on this makes me skeptical of dimensions on other Pyrex Storage Rectangular Dishes with Dark Blue Plastic Cover, which I would otherwise consider purchasing. I like the product in principle but knowing the actual dimensions is very important to me in deciding what to buy."
4,"Versatile, Functional Food Storage","We're currently trying to replace all our plastic food storage containers and this was among our first purchases.Love the rectangular shape and functionality (fridge storage, microwave, freezer). Terrific multipurpose (storage and serving as well as cooking).And, yes, those lids can be tricky but they do fit.Can't comment on how they hold up over the long-term as we've only had a few weeks. But we use them multiple times each day and consider them a great value for the price.They're easy to stack and store, which is another bonus. And so much easier to clean up than icky plastic.(FYI: Glass is heavier than plastic and if you hand wash, you do have to be a bit careful when handling soapy pieces. If you're used to dropping plastic containers, you'll need to pay more attention.)"
5,Terrific Storage Containers,"I love these containers. As another reviewer said, they are the perfect size for a meal. I usually cook several meals on the weekend, and portion them out into individual containers. Of all the various single-serving containers I have (glass and plastic), these are my favorite. They go in the fridge, freezer, microwave, and dishwasher with no problems.The covers are a bit snug, but I haven't had a problem getting them on and off.I have 8 of these, and I'm about to place an order for 8 more!"
5,Pyrex storage 3-cup rectangular dish with dark blue plastic cover,"I love pyrex to start with. And now with the lid, it makes it so much easier to store in the fridge at any time."
3,Good but not great: Lid doesn't close well,"The glass is great but the lid doesn't close well: it's not made with silicon, just good old plastic so It doesn't close well."
3,Glass beats plastic - but lid doesn't seal tightly,"I have the same product in the 6 cup size, but the lid is red - anyway, the lid does not seal tightly; if there is even a small amount of liquid in the container, and you tip it even briefly, it will leak. But the lid does stay on at least."
2,Slightly disappointed,"The reason for my purchase was due to other reviews about it fitting under my Weber gas grill as a grease catcher.It didn't fit as indicated in those reviews.Being inexpensive in price, made the decision to keep it.I have found if you need those replacement Weber grease catchers underneath the grill, must buy from Weber directly."
3,Handy but leaky.,"I belong to a monthly dinner co-op, and these are the dishes we selected to package our dinners for the exchanges. The are the perfect size for a 1-2 serving meal, can go straight from oven to table and then to refrigerator with leftovers, and are very easy to clean. BUT, they leak like crazy. We selected these dishes because they have lids and can easily be taken to work for meals through the week, but if not kept perfectly flat, even the slightest amount of liquid dumps all over your bag. This is a great product if you only plan to use them for storage at home on flat surfaces."
5,Our Cavalier loves them,"Our spaniel loves these for a midday snack, and we love that they are better for him than rawhides, not to mention they're not messy or stinky."
4,Great Treat,"Made in America, My Dogs have Loved these great Vegetable treats a lot of bulk so it helps in other departments too. Just kinda expensive."
4,Do you really want to change?,This will movtivate you off of your recliner to get up and do something with yourself. It won't allow you to make excuses for your actions and will pump you up with a Navy Seal mentatlity.
2,"Beatable, Definitely Beatable","I was sorely disappointed in this book which purports to reveal practical training secrets from the Navy SEALS for everyday application. The author reveals himself to be a foul-mouthed boor masquerading as an enlightened warrior. The writing style is annoying and clumsy and chockful of UPPER CASE words. The exercises are ridiculous, particuarly the ones about revealing your deep dark secrets to your romantic partner and using your romantic partner as a mentor. The author shares that among the many women he had, he married four and, not surprisingly, divorced three. The other practical techniques are obvious and uninspiring.Skip this self-important tome and check out Release the Warrior Within by Machowicz instead. The same basic material is covered in a far more cohesive, less condescending manner."
3,Caution for small dogs,"We used the product for over 4 years before we learned that it shouldn't be opended and refrigerated for more than 3 days. For a small dog like a Chihuahua who can't finish a can in 3 days, this restriction is an issue. We stopped using it."
5,pretty good,Punisher is awesome no...LEGEN....wait for it...DARY! Kitchen Irish was not the best but it is a worthwhile read. Better than that war journal nonsense. Get all 10 volumes!!!
5,Perfect Bass,Simple if your sub doesn't have any sort of bass management you need this. The on screen display is decent being able to have presets on the remote is awesome. I am running this on some jl audio phantom 113 and they have a base managemet system in them but this one is so much better I use this. I highly recomend this.
1,Can't learn much!,I'm sad to say that you can't learn much through music if the toy quits working after only 1 month of play. I attempted to get support for this expensive toy system and (surprize!) they are not making this toy anymore. I wonder why?
2,Disappointed,This is not worth the money. I bought it a few years ago for a lot less money. Did not hold my child's attention as I thought it would - and she loves music. Definitely more for the lower recommended age group.
4,Luv this TOY!,My grandkids just love this toy. I had to buy 2 so they wouldn't fight over it all the time! Keeps them busy for quite a long time!
2,"Too loud, and hard to see.","While others seem to love this toy, I might not be able to stand it long enough to see the good qualities that others apparently do. It is WAY too loud, even on the lower volume setting. Also, the screen is hard to see, with the targeted lights from the back.But my daughter is only 17 months old, so maybe we'll put it away for a couple of months and see if she's able to get more out of it then. For now it is little more than a noisemaker."
2,"Not age appropriate & screen too dark, dull","Please note that my review is based on my daughter's experience from 18-21 months old. It was purchased for her as a gift. As a mother and an educator, I think that this product would be better suited for an older child as it is quite hard for a child younger than the age of 2 or even 2 1/2 to sustain the attention needed to interact with the games, etc. I would recommend waiting to purchase this for your 18 month old. I am an advocate for Fisher Price products as I feel Fisher Price is pretty accurate in guiding parents to age appropriate toys. However, with this one I feel they missed the mark. In addtion, the screen is simply too dull and dark in color to really see exactly what you are pushing. For this reason, I personally would not have bought this toy."
1,"Ok, While it works","We received this as a gift for our 2 1/2 year old. Like others I felt the screen was dark and hard to see. But since it was a gift I decided to buy a few additional cartridges. Within two months the forward and reverse buttons were not working correctly. The cartridges were messed up and the toy was not reading the page we were on. We tried new batteries, taking the cartridges apart and re-rolling the tape, nothing worked.My daughter enjoyed the songs while it worked but would get frustrated when she reached the last frame on the tape it and it would automatically rewind.IT was fun, but did not last long enough to justify the expnes. If I could give it a 0 for durability I would."
1,disappointed,"I purchased this for my 25 month old daughter for Christmas. She seemed to really like it so I purchased just about every tape that goes with it. Unfortunately, less than 2 months later the forward and rewind buttons quit working. This is not a very durable toy as my daughter really didn't use it but once and awhile. In addition, the screen is extremely difficult to see. I would not purchase this product again in the future."
3,Not interested,"My son got this for Christmas last year at age 1 1/2. We have had it for a year now and he is just not interested in it, even at age 2 1/2. He will pull it out and play with it every now and then for a few minutes, but for the most part it is just collecting dust."
2,"good idea, but poor electronics","when a child that is the appropriate age uses this, it skips ahead. ""where is the red bird?"" child pushes red bird slightly too hard and it says ""no, that's a red bird. Where is the yellow bird?"" It never makes sense - it is VERY sensitive.Wouldn't recommend."
1,DOA,Got the product. In 2 minutes it wasn't working. Mattel is sending me a new one. The basically tell you to cut the mic so it can't be used and toss it and they send you a new one. I thought it was a sad waste of resources that they don't look to recycle the product.
3,A good toy,"My son got this for Christmas when he was 2. He really enjoys it. His favorite thing is to record himself and then listen to it.Overall, I think this is a pretty good toy, but I do have to say that I think its a little hard to see the screen.All in all, I would recommend this toy to any toddler who loves music!"
4,Fun toy,"I bought this for my daughter who is 16months, she loves the music. It took her a while to figure out the microphone, and the screens move very quickly, but she seems to be enjoying the toy."
4,"So much fun, but bulky.","My kids loved these things, they would sit for hours singing in the microphone, and changing the cartridges. Only bad side is they are quite bulky, and a little on the heavy side. Also the more they are used, the harder it is to change the cartridges. They tend to get stuck."
2,disappointed,"My children don't have the patience for this. To touch and listen is asking a lot of a toddler. I have two children is this age range, neither of them have ever been interested in this toy."
4,Is a great product...,although the first one had to be sent back because the forward/rewind button did not work. Amazon was great about replacing it though and my son loves it!
3,Screen is too dark!!!!!,"We just purchased this for our two-year-old's birthday. The concept of the toy is neat, but the screen is too dark to really make out anything. It has circles of lights in the base that go on and off, depending on what screen is playing & what places are being touched, however, this doesn't totally illuminate the picture, which makes it hard to answer questions because you can't see the pictures clearly. Fisher Price needs to design this better."
4,Nice cheap utility set,"I picked this set up as a back-up for lost tools at work. They perform well enough for me to consider a second set, as I tend to destroy bits on an almost daily basis. Not professional, but inexpensive enough to beat on them and replace as necessary."
3,"Nice approach, flawed theology","This book should have been a 50-page monograph. Instead, through repetition and at times forced humor, it swelled to 240 pages. It is fun at times, but the theology is really poor. The author thinks that earthquakes and floods are more likely to occur in a ""godless"" universe, discounting the whole idea of a fallen nature. In other words, Original Sin did not just corrupt man, but all of nature (after the fall God created thorns, thistles and weeds and allowed earthquakes and floods too).What most people, including this author, really mean when they say that God doesn't exist (or that there's an X percent chance of God existing) is that God isn't like them (or God is about X percent like them.) Just look at the arguments, for example - ""Well, if God is good then why do children die? Children dying doesn't seem good to me, so God isn't good."" If you use the author's method, you're more likely to get an indication of how much God is like you, not whether He exists."
5,An Excellent Framework for Consideration,"Some reviewers have focused too much on Dr. Unwin's conclusion, ignoring the valuable and provoking framework he provides for the overall discussion. In an easy-to-read and witty manner, the author provides a mathmatical context in which to discuss not only the existence of God, but the role of faith in our beliefs. Within that framework, Unwin offers up his own proofs, while leaving adequate room (and clear instruction) for the reader to substitute their own proofs. For any reader that wishes to risk examing their beliefs within a proven, established and logical discipline such as Bayesian probability theory, this is a great read. In the end, it is a means whereby each reader can determine for themselves where belief ends and faith begins."
5,Good God,"I really loved this book. It seems to be a completely revolutionary way (at least to me) of looking at belief in God. There is a math part to it, but the author is very good at explaining it. I wish he'd been my math teacher. On top of all this, the book is really very funny. He seems able to work in the humor at the same time as keeping the serious theme moving along. My guess is that this book will open up a whole new line of enquiry into God and religious beliefs."
4,A train leaves Chicago traveling....,"From Bayes to Pascal this book was a flashback to high school math class for me. No, both were not dull and tedious, both were enlightening and fun. My high school teacher would manage to make to dullest problems interesting with his ample use of examples involving ferrets and wombats. Have you ever had a test where you needed to calculate the size and angles of a three sided ferret pen? Weird works for high school students.Dr. Unwin is wise enough to not simply plug in numbers and produce an answer. He escorts the reader through basic and complex concepts as he explains methods of calculating probability. Even if you know the basics of Las Vegas you will learn a thing or two from this book.Not to diminish the question of God, but the knowledge and process provided lends themselves to other pursuits. If only this text was published sooner, someone could have calculated the probability of WMDs in Iraq."
5,It's the little things...,"A wonderful book that is chock full of useful strategies to bring more fun and fulfillment to the work place. This entertaining book was the perfect tool to help me overhaul the mood in our organization. Not only do our employees appear more excited about work, but absentism has dropped.The saying is true ""It's the little things in life"" and those little things can make all the difference for you and your employees."
5,Must Buy!,"Outstanding guide that will put the fun back into your work, and the work of your employees! Great ideas, suggestions, and anecdotes!! A Must Buy!"
5,Love this!,"Amazing price; completely adjustable; VERY flattering. The first corset I ever purchased so do not have another to compare it to, but I love this (and so does my boyfriend)."
2,Check out the wording,"I did not receive a keypad rendering this faceplate useless. I have a 2035a, they sent a 2035 faceplate which is compatible if you have the keypad."
4,Great Little Band Saw,I purchased a Porter Cable 9725 Porta-Band Saw Kit a few months ago and it has performed well. The compact right angle worm drive keeps the tool compact and quiet. Like most of the older Porter Cable tools the Porta-Band saw is made almost entirely of metal with excellent quality throughout.The saw cuts cleanly through everything I put it up against. The two-speed feature allows the user to slow the saw down for hard material like tool steels. Porter Cable sells high quality bi-metal replacement blades that cut fast and clean. The supplied cutting lubrication stick really helps speed up the work and extend the life of the saw blade. My only reservation is the omission of a power lock button. When using the saw with the optional stand (the stand comes with a funky spring clamp) or when cutting through large stock a power lock button would be nice.
3,Comprehensive review of the racing bikes,"While Mick Walker does a good job of reveiwing the entire history of Japanese racing bikes, more technical information about the machines would have been appreciated. The author tends to focus a lot of space on the riders/events/results rather than a technical/specification analysis.Overall, this book is a good reference, but it could have been much better."
4,Does NOT need the Connectivity Toolkit,"This cable is a great alternative to the $100+ Connectivity Toolkit. It is the same cable included in the kit but does not include the software. This is excellent for connecting to Palm devices and other handhelds (the Connectivity Kit software wouldn't work on them anyway) or to desktop or laptop computers if you don't care about the rather sorry image compression provided by the Connectivity Toolkit. The toolkit is NOT required to use this cable OR your Sprint PCS handset as a modem- in Windows just create a ""Generic modem"" on that serial port, set it at 19.2kbps, and you're done. Well worth the $100 savings."
5,"Light, Well Written and Very Entertaining","This is a very well written book on the noise in our lives. I particularily like his definition of noise - it's unwanted signals that impact on our receivers. For the most part this is audio, and it widely depends upon the situation. I'm sure that that jerk in the car next to me with the booming heart-beat frequency music doesn't think the racket he is forcing upon the rest of us is noise.This is a popular science type book. It's written for the interested layman. He uses examples from examples from everyday life as examples. For instance in his chapter 'Fighting Noise with Noise' he uses the noise cancelling ability of modern electronics to enable a doctor (or the prospective mother) to hear the heart beat of a baby before it is born. I also liked his description of the frequency-hopping spread spectrum patent. Besides being one of the most beautiful women ever known, she was clearly no dummy.All in all light, readable and very enjoyable."
2,Far from Fuzzy Logic,"I grabbed this book automatically, having known Kosko's writing in Fuzzy Logic in the 1980s. Then, he took a new concept and brought it to life in a simple, interesting way. In Noise, Kosko basically just re-tells the science of the types of noise. It is missing the simplicity and predictions of Fuzzy Logic. I made it half-way through before decided to save myself the pain."
4,Noise by Bart Kosko,"Noise,Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy LogicNoise like his previous popular book Fuzzy Thinking is another impressive work by the polymath Bart Kosko. Kosko's easy reading humorous style teaches and enlightens making another wise difficult topic accessible to the non-engineering layperson."
5,Read the whole thing if you're going to post a review,"Notice that the ratings bifurcate and that most of the low ones admit to quitting pretty early. Kosko has a deeper emphasis on aspects of noise that are close to his own research, which is what I'd want and expect. If you're looking for popular biz-techno-babble, this isn't it. If you're looking for a classroom textbook on noise, complete with homework assignments, this isn't it either. If you'd like a fascinating introduction to the topic of noise, self-contained but with plenty of references to dig deeper, this is the book for you."
3,Little more than a rumble,"This is one of those books that I picked up as I was fascinated with the topic, ""noise."" Having had a life-long aversion to all types of ""noise"" (in all of its various manifestations) - which Kosko defines as ""a signal we don't like"" - I was quite interested in what I had read while glancing through it at the bookstore Upon reading it; however, I was quite disappointed, this book is quite bland and seems to leap from topic to topic (although some of those had the potential to be fascinating) and I really could not determine what angle the author was trying to take. ""Noise"" could be a book on physics, philosophy, law, pop-science, acoustics, computer science, or many other things (in no particular order). That happens to be its downfall - it's a book in search of focus. Overall, I was greatly disappointed as I had originally hoped this would be an enlightening book: in the end, it was little more than a noisy diversion to my list of books to read."
3,disappointing,"Pop science writing is a tough thing to do well and an even tougher thing to sell to the general public but it seems publishers have hit upon a recipe for creating a dumbed-down pop-sci book: take an interesting germ of an idea, whip it full of air with lots of quotations, redundant examples of any given phenomenon the author is trying to explain, pages of endnotes and an extensive bibliography (which sadly was not included in the Kosko book) and then slap a cool looking graphic on the front cover. Voila! an instant 300 page pop-sci book.This book adheres very closely to that recipe. Sad, as I was really looking forward to this book.The benchmark for an outstanding pop-sci book is still held by James Gleick's 'Chaos' in my opinion. 'Noise' falls very short of that, sorry to say."
2,Rather disappointing,"I had high expectations for this book, but I was disappointed. It concentrated too much on digital systems, rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment. I lost interested in the last 1/3 of the book, and couldn't wait to finish."
2,Meh,"I had to fight every chapter in this book. It is horribly boring. It is clear that Professor Kosko really enjoys noise, but he fails to make it interesting."
2,Not great but think of it as long trailer to watch the complete series.,"This is edited version of 20 hours of drama into about 2 hours. That's 18 hours of story, plots, character development that gets deleted. If I had to say anything positive, it gives you small taste of quality you can expect from the series. The acting, special effects, and style of action it is so you can decide for yourself to collect actual big box set."
5,Great Book,"Well written, great photography, well researched sidebars on significant, influential models, more than I expected for the price. Very well done."
1,"Very low quality, bad experience with seller, I would never do it again!!!!","I purchased this item just few weeks before having my baby. When I opened for my first trial I realized the suction was not strong enough to get milk. The motor is very loud and it was vibrating too much. I contacted the seller by mail (by phone never returned the call) to return or exchange the product. The seller said that it was not possible but they could replece it for an used one, I said what??????? I didn't pay for an used pump so please give me my money back. They suggested to contact the manufacterer, when I did it, they told me that this pump based on the serial number it has been USED and they don't manufacter this kind of pumps anymore due to a recent recall on the product, they are no BPA free and I should return it. I tried, but with any success...So, VERY BAD SELLER, and BAD PRODUCT as well (maybe the new version is much better who knows???)"
4,"a peek at life through death, in all shapes and sizes","Phoenix Tales by Gregory Banks is an eclectic collection of death and rebirth short stories.These death stories come in all shapes and sizes. Among many other topics, there are stories centering around cloning, apocalyptic events, and voodooism. They show characters dealing with regrets and consequences, acting out revenge, cowering in fear, and even embracing the end of this life. Some stories are funny, and some are poignant. One story even rhymes. Another is told from the perspective of the dead person at his funeral.And they're very good stories, filled with conflicts, packed with drama, exploring love and hate and joy and sorrow. Banks's character studies show how versatile he is -- his stories gave me bunches of new perspective on how people live with death."
4,Lasagna Baker,"Great sized, heavy ceramic lasagna baker. The gold dust pattern lends itself well to this piece. If you are not familiar with the pattern, the ""green"" is more blue than green. I love the design of this pattern and am willing to deal with the somewhat sloppy finish. If you are a perfectionist, this pattern is probably not for you. (The irregularities are deemed part of the pottery finish and to be expected.) Casual, yet stylish, this is an excellent buy."
5,Very pleased,I like having everything mathing my dishes to set a table. The lasagna pan came broken and Amazon.com promptly replaced it for me. I am very happy with the purhcase.
2,Too Isolated,"I loved the plastic and the clear, colored markings tha show up real good, but was deeply disappointed that it did NOT show the entire city of San Antonio, as billed. It centered rght on the central part of SA and the Alamo, but when you want to use i to get to OTHER places aside downtown---forget it, it becomes a topography map not a road map and is very disappointing."
2,Not as good and I hoped,"This map was not easy to read, and not as clear to give me good directions. It is laminated, so it is not easily soiled or torn, but that is about the best part of it."
3,Not as helpful as I hoped,This CD is relaxing and might help if used more then 2 or 3 times (as recommended). I was just as anxious as usual on test day and definitely didn't improve my score or reduce my test anxiety after using this CD.
4,Good tool,"I have been using the 6"" Malco hand seamer for several weeks now as I build copper-clad steel chimney caps (around 5'x7' footprints). I have used this tool (and the 4"" similar model) during every stage of copper work from cladding 3"" square steel tubing, to forming and assembling a peaked 1"" double-locked standing-seam roof.Pros: lots of power and leverage from the angled design. 6"" of gripping surface is 4"" more than most other hand seamers. Wroks well for flattening seams after you undo them.Cons: if you want a really clean break more than 6"", you should use another tool, black rubber grips tend to loosen and slide around over time (just an annoyance really)This is a good tool for starting sheet-metal workers."
4,Classical Shuri-Te Karate Kata,It's nice to see someone keep the old kata alive and introduce them to the rest of us. Thank you.
4,I can't help myself. I liked it.,"Perhaps the best way to describe this is to say it's savory but for special tastes. I'm an action movie fan, fond of plots where the hero faces all odds and triumphs. From that perspective, Arena works. The fight scenes are fun, the bad guys are nasty in the traditional sense, and the bruised hero is true blue to the end. Call it cliche (and maybe it is), but it's fun and never boring. If anything, it remindes me of those WWE films like The Marine and Twelve Rounds."
5,Loved it,"I'm a Kellan Lutz fan. I loved the character Samuel L Jackson played, all the qualities he brought the the villain. I love bloody action movies and if you do too, give this one a chance."
3,Eastman ss cooker set,"After assembling the cook, the hose attachment would not attach to the burner assembly, I had to use a tap set on the burner to get it connected. The SS pots are thinner than I had thought. But the cooker cooks really well. The price (on sale) was reasonable compared to the other brands with SS pots. If you can find another brand around this price ( with SS pots )I would definitely consider it for the pots. As far as the propane burner goes it's fairly descent and except for the problem I mention earlier, I would recommend it."
1,Great eyelash remover...if you like styes,"I never write reviews NEVER, but I felt the need to write one this time. Soo I switched eyelash removers and I tried this one out WELL when I put it on not only did it burn my eyes like hell it didn't remove all the glue and gave my a huge stye on my right eye and a smaller one on my left one. So now I'm a makeup artist I have a big even on Saturday an guess what? My eyes are swelled up so bad an how in the world can I look my best? It's embarrassing to go out and I can promise you I never break out have any sensitivity whatsoever. So buyer beware , seriously ...I'm really upset."
1,Disappointing if you are seeking business insights,"A good book if you want resumes of biotech industry pioneers, but written from a strongly US-centric and scientific rather than commercial point of view. I had hoped to gather insights into what it's like being part of a new start-up venture, but instead found little more than generous (if uncritical) praise of the scientific workers involved in the story."
3,Not What I Wanted,"This is not what I was expecting, but it will help us in choosing songs to sing for our choir."
5,A long time coming,"It's taken a lifetime, but what comes from these poems is a corpus of poetry whose strength lies in the long time coming. These are poems of power and poetic achievement from a poet who trained under perhaps the greatest poet-teacher of the century and whose poetry first appeared in print almost half a century ago alongside a then-living Sylvia Plath."
4,A Must For Bluegrass Lovers....,"This disc contains some of the best ""pickin"" and vocals, only to be compared to The Seldom Scene. The CD contains original cuts, as well as, covers. The title cut stands out as the best, with the lonesome vocals and outstanding musical work, it has tremendous depth and feeling."
1,Netting broke within hous,I bought this for my 7 year old soccer player for Christmas. Within 2 hours of opening the package the netting has came undone and the ball will not stay in the net now. I will be purchasing a different type of kick trainer now (no netting).
1,Poor quality on all accounts.,"They may sound good and look good, but look somewhere else for earhuggers. Aside from being uncomfortable, they're unsteady and one-size-fits-all in two plastic wraps that easily come loose from your ears, as well as the actual earbuds dropping from their holders. And apart from all of that, the sound quality is horrific. You would be best doing a search again and finding a new pair."
2,"Um, bad?","Poor quality little buds. I just bought them for the rubber ""earhugger"" piece to be used with other phones."
4,Burn Notice,I enjoyed this show very much and am glad to have it on DVD for future use. It is a very different show and original.
4,Burn Notice is #1,"This show is an easy 5. No problem at all. Out of all the shows I watch (Burn Notice, Psych, Lost, 24, The Big Bang Theory, Transformers Animated & The Spectacular Spider-Man) this is just the absolute best show.However. The dvd is a bit lacking. My main issues is what they say they have and what they have. I want to work in the entertainment industry as a writer and maybe director. I find all the behind the scenes features and commentary very interesting. So when I read ""Cast & Crew Commentary on every episode"". That sounds like a what dream to me with the cast they have. What they fail to mention is that it's not for the entire episode and it's not the entire cast. It's certain members for certain scenes in each episode. And it's not an entire episode.But you should by all means buy the DVD. You won't regret it. It's a comedy drama. Not a drama comedy. It is dramatic, but they are not scared at all to use sarcastic comedy and common sense to make you laugh."
5,Great First Season,"I wasn't sure about this show, I had only seen a few previews but it didn't really peak my interest. I purchased Season 1 to see what it was all about, and ended up loving it! I am looking forward to seeing the rest of the seasons!!"
5,best show on television,"This is the best show on television. Period. It's funny, it's sexy, it's full of espionage and intrigue, and the characters completely grab your attention. Each episode is action-packed, and I love the narrative by the main character, explaining little bits and pieces of the spycraft. And, of course, the best part of the show has to be Gabrielle Anwar. Is this the most beautiful woman in Hollywood, or what? It is impossible to take your eyes off of her. This is an exceptional series, all the way around. I've been waiting for the first season to be released on disc, and will be one of the first in line to grab a copy. Do yourself a favor and get into this show."
5,ZOWIE!!!,"When I saw that 218 people had already submitted a review I knew mine would be short. And besides, 218 reviewers really says it all, doesn't it? Would 218 viewers submit reviews if it wasn't a ""corker""???I came across this rather late and my review only pertains to season one, tho I have since purchased seasons two and three. Here is my review...ZOWIE!!!This is more fun with more thrills and more sex appeal than all the James Bonds put together. Quirky, loads of fun, fast-paced action and great humor, this series has it all. Love the cast. Who needs another corpse-on-a-slab Law and Order, CSI series when you can watch this high-octane stuff? Great on DVD as a billion commercials are by-passed.Recommended. Should hold up after numerous viewings. Buy it. You won't get burned."
5,TV Review,This is one of the most refreshing shows on the air. I work long hours and when I come home I like to relax and watch good television. The show is well thought out and the characters are a good fit. I would like to see who burned him but I guess that is what keeps you watching. It is an excellent show.
5,Brilliant show,"Burn Notice is about a spy who is confined to the lovely city of Miami, Florida. Throughout the series, he utilizes his knowledge, skills and talents to help people and track down the people who burned him and thus forced him to endure a life in Miami. It's not so bad though, Michael Weston(Jeffrey Donovan) has his girlfriend Fiona(Grabrille Anwar) and good old Sam Axe(Bruce Campbell. This series has Bruce Campbell! Need I say more? Anyway, the show remains very intelligent and is constantly narrated by Michael, who explains why he does somethings that may seem crazy. This show is really brilliantly written. Nothing makes for better TV than intelligent characters doing what they do best: taking on bad guys who in the end just haven't got a clue no matter how clever they seem to be. Let's hope Michael Weston eventually finds out who burned him."
4,Burn Notice is a great show,"I very much like this show. It is very entertaining and has fresh new takes on crime fighting. All in all, worth the money. Looking forward to the next season availability."
5,100% satisfied,very happy with the my purchase. exactly what was written about product. would buy from seller again.
5,SPYFUN,"The dvd is fun, a pleasure to remember the early episodes.I endorse this dvd for anyone who enjoys a good spy thriller, comedy and an excellent cast. I found the tv show by accident and it has quickly become my favorite"
5,The best show on television!,"If you like Bond, MacGyver and Magnum P.I., you'll love this show! It's got a splash of everything to tantalize the senses including action, comedy, drama and an ingenious script throughout the series.What sets this show apart is that there is always two stories commencing at the same time and they meld together seamlessly. There's quite a bit of overdubbed dialog from the main actor being reminiscent of Magnum PI days which is cool because it helps carry the viewer throughout the show. The show is set in Miami and the cinematography is fresh, creative and entertaining. Just buy it and you'll watch it many times!"
5,Great Show!,This show continues to grow on me. It's stories and characters are a great mix. Get it now!
5,Outstanding,"I happened to be traveling in the States when I came across this series. I was hooked immediately. While I enjoyed season one on DVD, I'm anxiously waiting for season two to come out. Great action, intelligent writing, outstanding casting and just the right amount of comedy relief. I highly recommend this series."
5,I love this show!,"The Burn Notice is awesome! When it first came on I thought it was stupid and the character, Michael Weston, was too arrogant. But then USA had a Burn Notice marathon and I was hooked! The first season is a bit edgier, but it's all good!"
5,Most fun and casual show on TV,"This show is fun, that's the best way to describe it. I just happened to stumble upon an episode and immediately got hooked. Luckily I caught this show right before the premiere of season 2 so they ran a Burn Notice marathon which allowed me to DVR the whole of season 1. Definitely the most fun show on TV by far. It's light, funny with good fun action. Very original show and cast of characters as well. The locations pretty, the actors and actresses are pretty, the sunglasses are pretty, etc etc. Definitely check this out and watch it when it comes on so they don't cancel it. TOO MANY GOOD SHOWS GO UNNOTICED AND GET CANNED."
2,HO HUM,"I don't get the 5 star reviews. There is nothing original about this show. This guy isn't a convincing character either. He's just a little too cool for school if u catch my drift. I have only seen 2 episodes, so it's possible I missed the good ones. But I doubt it varies much."
2,Good Show Burned By Bad Language,"There isn't a whole lot I can add to the reviews already written by many posters. They are correct, this is a funny original show, however...I stopped watching after the first 7 or 8 episodes because I just couldn't stand the endless blasphemy in each and every episode. The writing is so crisp that I have to say I just couldn't understand why there had to be several uses of GD and the name of Jesus Christ used in vain in every episode. What a shame, I would have liked to continue, but just couldn't because of this lack of respect toward Christ.Always wondered why no other gods are blasphemed in movies and TV show. Hmmm... maybe because they are not around to hear it. Oh well, here's to hoping USA cleans up their act."
3,Decent show,"I like the show, but wouldn't watch it without the DVDs. I may try the second season.The biggest downside is the writing. It just isn't quite as perfect as other outstanding shows on television right now. One show that is similar but a step above Burn Notice is the new series, The Glades on A&E.; Better writing make it a better viewing experience. If you like The Glades, you may like Burn Notice, but don't expect Burn Notice to blow you away."
5,One of my favorite shows ever - can't wait to buy Season Two!,"I think this is a great series, so what can I say, but I love the DVD. Um, sorry this review isn't especially helpful. If you like Burn Notice, you need this DVD of Season One to refresh your memory. There's always stuff you didn't notice the first time around that ties into the series later."
5,What happened to Sharon Gless,"I've often wondered what happened to Sharon Gless after ""Cagney and Lacy"". Now I know, she's still appearing in top notch serials.Now if Hulu would start running old ""Cagney and Lacy"" episodes."
3,Burn Notice somewhat repetitive in style,"I enjoyed the premise of Burn Notice. However, after two or three episodes I noticed similar themes and a lack of continuing originality. It's really a shame because the idea behind the show is very interesting."
1,don't bother,Didn't care for it at all; perhaps I was spoiled after just finishing watching all 8 seasons of 24; but don't plan on renting any more episodes of burn notice.
5,Awesome show.,I bought this DVD set for my husband because he loves this show. He watched the entire season within a couple weeks and now has to have season 2.
5,Take notice of Burn Notice,"Wow, what a great tv show. Think MacGyver meets Magnum PI. Wonderful cast(Bruce Campbell is awesome), great characters, and great action packed episodes. Each episode seems to fly by. At the end of each episode you're left begging for more. Definitely give this show a try!Happy Watching!"
5,One of the BEST shows on TV,I absolutely love this show. It's great fun and gives a completely different perspective on the spy theme. A must watch show...
5,Burn Notice,"This show is well written with dry and sarcastic humor, awkward situations and some action.A truly enjoyable show to watch that is fun and entertaining."
5,One of the best shows on TV!,One of the best shows on TV! Great characters and stories. Action and humor. Gives you hints on how to be a spy in every episode!
4,"Interesting characters, exciting plot","My husband and I both really enjoy this show. We bought it for my dad for christmas and our whole family really enjoyed it (we're all mid-twenties and older). I think it's best described as a newer, improved version of the show MacGyver. The main character is a former spy who is fired (or 'burned') and then reduced to helping those who have been wronged, scammed, or hurt in some other way in order to restore justice for them and earn a living for himself. The main character is resourceful, entertaining, and unpredictable and he is surrounded by an ex-girlfriend, a former FBI agent/friend, and a nagging mother that all add to the dimension and humor of the show."
4,Burn Notice Season 1,"Burn Notice is a very clever, witty, laid back and a very entertaining thriller.It starts out with a spy in a middle of a top-secret mission getting `burned' (fired without warning and left to fend for yourself) he escapes and later finds himself awaking and stuck in Miami with all his accounts frozen. To make ends meet, he basically takes up odd jobs as sort of a Private Detective while he searches for the reason he was `burned'.Jason Donovan is perfect in this role and Gabrielle Anwar whom I have had a crush on since `Scent of A Woman' sizzles in this series! And how can I not mention Jason's goofy sidekick Bruce Cambell who takes this series humour to a different level. The finale for the season in this box set combines both part 1 and 2 into one seamless explosive action packed punch! Can hardly wait for season 2..."
5,Great action show,I never heard of this before i bought the DVD - and i found it was great. lots of action and very interesting plots and wonderful actors. good guest stars and this is good for kids for they explain most of the events as they unfold so no one is ever lost - all can figure out the happenings w/o giving away the end.great for family.andMonk - Season One
5,Christmas gift,"I bought this as a gift for Christmas for someone who loves the show.I'm super glad that it wasn't too expensive,"
5,Great DVD!,"My 2 boys (4 and 2) love this DVD. We own all 3 of Laurie Berkner DVD's to date and I think this is the most professionally done one yet. The first time I played the DVD, they were a little hesitant because it's produced differently than than her first 2 DVDs. The DVD has a party theme throughout - Birthday party, Costume party, and Pajama paty. The music is very upbeat and very high-energy, dance music for the entire DVD. The second time I played the DVD, the boys understood the theme of the DVD and really enjoyed and danced the whole time. The parties are really colorful and effect were just right. There's nothing I can complain about this DVD."
4,Another great LBB DVD,"Another great LBB collection. Their sound has changed somewhat from the ""Let's Hear it for Laurie"" collection, and they've upped the production quality for this one, lots of use of green screen (think ""Blues Clues"") graphics. There are a some really smart, great songs (Party Day, This Hat, Last Night, Where is the Cake, Goodnight) and a couple that are just filler (Birthday Song, Pillowland) Overall, a fun and entertaining DVD that will get the kids up and dancing."
3,Like but not love yet,This DVD is not like the bands first- not as lively as the first DVD. it is taking a few weeks for my son to pick this video - but getting there
3,I wish I could give this 2.75 or 2 and 1/2 stars,"This is currently the best book on the topic of online love searching tools and advice especially for people without special needs which I know is the smaller percentage of those possibly online love searching. But, the books on this topic need major improvement. I will write more of a review latter but this author is connected also 2 more online supports for you on this topic. Through other paid merchandise and love coaching and such. You can find this advice mostly on certain sites for free like e-harmony, chemistry, match, the relationship exchange, and yahoo personals. Or you could easily learn it for yourself using any/some of these sites!"
4,Are We Playing A Game????,"The story takes place during many events in the life of Winston Churchill. The Boer War, WW1 and the beginnings of WW2. Each time the Doctor has a feeling that events to assassinate Churchill are being manipulated by an unknown team. Most impressive was the use of the 6th Doctor to relay a similar confrontation with Churchill during his 2nd persona. Once again, as in the Eight Doctors, Terrance Dicks is trying to smooth out continuity stuff-ups, by having the 2nd Doctor run errands for the CIA (Celestial Intervention Agency) just before his forced regeneration Therefore the 2nd Docs appearance and references to Jamie and Zoe about all knowledge of him being wiped from their minds in the Five Doctors was obviously during this period. One problem though - you don't really get to find out who or what the PLAYERS are. All characterisation is spot on. Well written, easily read, very entertaining - RECOMMENDED to all."
4,Finally I saw this beautiful gem!,"For so many years I've believed this movie was forever lost, so when I found it on Amazon I bought it immediately, also if it's a DVD-R. The quality is fairly good, so I recommend it to the silent movie public, but I would like to see one day a better edition, this is why I put 4 stars and not 5... Anyway I'm completely satisfied and I didn't think for one second if to buy it or not... It's sad so little people loves silents, I believe to be the only one in Italy to have purchased this item..."
3,Earth Mama,"- my baby's head stinks after shower or its probably the after smell of fragrance free lol- soap free so it does not lather well, it washes so fast and it feels like i have to use again and again to make sure lol"
2,Not a fan of the scent,"I've been looking for something cheaper than California Baby Calming body wash/shampoo, which I currently use for my kids. Had high hopes for this, I do like the foaming pump bottle that you can use one-handed. The stuff just smells too strong though. I have never considered myself sensitive to perfumes, but this smell just gets to me--it has a smell reminiscent of vomit. Ugh."
5,3 years and still hooked,"We love LOVE this baby wash. I have used it since my son was first born, and he will soon turn 3. It is expensive, but each bottle does last quite a long time, and its well worth it. The smell is wonderful, and doesn't last long--a good thing in my book, as I don't want him covered in scent, even a naural one. The foam is silky and rinses easily with no residue. When we use a different brand for travelling, I can always tell that his hair isn't as soft and clean as it is with his Earth Mama wash. I only wish I could afford to use it on myself too!"
3,Dull hair and soap scum!,I love Earth Mama products - especially the Angel Baby Butt Balm! So when I was looking for an organic/safer shampoo/body wash I knew I wanted to try their product. I liked it at first but then noticed that it left my son's hair very dull - no shine and it wasn't nice and soft anymore. I also noticed that all of his bath toys developed this thick layer of soap scum that they didn't have before using the product and it also leaves a soap scum ring around the tub. It's also NOT tear free and really did seem to irritate my son's eyes if any got in them. I do love the citrus scent. I also use the Angel Baby lotion and like that very well. I'm saddened this product didn't work for us. (trying Burt's Bees Baby Bee shampoo/body wash and so far like that really well).
3,Really thin,"I like the smell of this soap, it smells like oranges. The major problem I have with it is that it's SO thin and watery. It is not good as a shampoo at all. It leaves my hair greasy, and I normally never have problems with greasy hair."
2,Can't Stand the Smell :(,"I give this 2 stars because it is at least organic and has Zero toxins in it. Other than that, I hate this stuff! I had high hopes and really wanted to like it. I thought it smelled great when it was still in the bottle but after bathing my son and myself in it, it left an awful smell on the both of us. I didn't realize it at first but it was BAD! I honestly think it's the orange oil because it smells acidic. It also dried out his skin :( I would be more inclined to use it if it smelled better and didn't dry out my baby's skin."
2,not great,"Love the smell, but this is extremely drying. Definitely not our favorite. The foam is not great either. I will not be repurchasing."
5,Top 10 baby essential,"This product is definitely one of the top 10 baby essentials for me - and I am not talking 10 cosmetic products.. We only use two products on our baby, this one and a home-made shea butter cream. This wash is so gentle, we bathe our baby every day and he has never ever had any skin issues. His skin is super soft and healthy. We wash his hair about every 2-3 days and are careful not to get any shampoo in his eyes but so far he has never ever cried during bath time, even if some water gets on his face. We also love the yummy orange smell. I used this wash myself a few times and I love it too! I am jealous the baby gets it every day :) We bought the smaller size, which has a very handy foaming pump and this refill size makes it much cheaper and more convenient than buying the smaller size every time we run out. Will be recommending to all my friends w/ babies!"
2,Not a fan,"Well, it's organic. That's about the nicest thing I can say about it. The foam goes nowhere and leaves my three year old's hair so greasy looking. Also, it has a light but odd orange smell to it in the bottle. I could deal with that, even though it's not a delicious fruity smell, more like a light spicy orange smell, but on her hair - oh my. I honestly thought my husband forgot to wash her hair the first time because it smelled like it still had spit up from my newborn on her. But several washes later, I now know that's just the smell. As one other reviewer put it, it smells like vomit. Not horribly gross vomit, really, but baby vomit/spit-up if that makes you feel better. I won't be buying it again."
3,Earth Mama vs Lafes,"We bought Earth Mama Baby Shampoo and Lafes Organic Baby Shampoo after learning about the Johnson & Johnson fiasco. Up to that point, we were using Aveeno, a J&J; brand that had the harmful chemicals in it. J&J; committed to remove these chemicals in the next 2 years, but that's not good enough.Earth Mama:- makes good foam and is certified organic.- has a rating of 0 on Skin Deep Database (0-2 rating means no harmful chemicals)- fragrance is medium-strong (citrus).- not tear-free.Lafes:- makes better foam than Earth Mama's shampoo.- it's not certified organic, but still has a rating of 0 on Skin Deep Database.- almost fragrance free- tear-free formula.Baby seems to like both. We use Lafes on her hair and Earth Mama on her body, but in the future we will stay with Lafes."
1,Burns and itches,"I know others like this brand, and its ingredients ARE very clean, but that said it really burns the baby's eyes. It also has an extremely strong smell. I prefer my baby to smell like himself not like he just bathed in an orange. (and it burns eyes just as though you had squirted citrus into them. I know. I tried it for myself.) I have used this soap several times while showering with the baby and found that it makes my skin and scalp itch like crazy."
4,"Great smell, gentle on baby's skin","I love the smell of this body wash. My baby girl smells like orange sherbert after her bathtime. It's gentle on her delicate skin and gives me the peace of mind that she's not absorbing any toxins. The only thing keeping me from giving it a five star review is that her hair still looks oily after it's washed with this. I know it can't really be helped because the product is made with essential oils to keep baby's skin from drying. Also, another reviewer said that a little goes a long way. That's not the case. I usually have to use 6 pumps of this for a full bath for her and I'm not applying it generously either. But overall, I would recommend this. It does what it's supposed to and my baby hasn't had any skin reactions to this."
1,Not even sealed!,"Smells and looks differently from what I bought last time, not to mention that the product I got this time is not sealed at all. The one I bought last time is sealed under the lid, while this time, I found they use plastic to wrap the lid from outside, nothing inside under the lid. I will never buy from this seller any more."
2,Too liquidy,"Not so crazy about this shampoo. It smells great (orangy-citrus), but it's very liquidy and is hard to get out of my baby's hair. Don't think I'll buy it again."
1,Will burn your child's eyes. Beware.,Worst shampoo ever. My kids were crying when the bubbles got in their eyes. The warning on the bottle was tiny.
3,Earth Mama-Angel Baby Organic Angel Baby Shampoo & Body Wash,"Not as great as I expected. The hear is still a bit knotty. The smell is great otherwise. It says on the bottle that it is over 300 pumps, find it hard to believe because I need more than 2 pumps per hair wash."
5,Smells Great!,We love the smell and it keeps our baby smelling nice and clean. Highly recommend it for anyone interested in keeping toxins away from your baby's skin.
5,"Simple, effective, gentle soap.","I love that there are no chemicals in this soap, that it smells wonderful, and that it doesn't irritate my daughter's sensitive skin. I even use it for myself--for body and face! It isn't harsh at all, and it's nice having one container of soap for the whole family."
4,"like, not love",This seems a little watery in texture and the smell is okay. I prefer dr. bronners baby castile soap over this one.
3,"Good at start, but gets problems quick","When I got this product I was so excited to get it and use it. After the hour it took me to transform it, it was okay even though I never got to fully have it perfectly done. The final plate that is moved when turning it into a tank was blocked by something I don't know what. Also, the main cannon stopped lighting up after a week. Eventually the sound stopped working even though I hardly make do the sounds. I'm also disappointed that the main turning turret would not stay up or completely lock in place in robot mode. In all I do not think I would get it again, especially not for $40! Do not get this, it's got too many problems."
5,Don't buy generic batteries for your M.,"I've tried the power2000 battery, and bought 4 other batteries shipped to me from China. besides compatibility, they don't hold their charge beyond 4-5 cycles. So save your money, get the real deal, and don't worry about whether or not your batteries will work on your next trip!"
3,"Works in an M9 too, btw","Works great. The battery came with Russian writing, which I read about elsewhere online. Some speculated that this was a counterfeit product, but based on research it appears a change in the manufacturing source and limited production in China / Japan caused a shift in supply. I'm not sure on the full facts of this information but the battery holds a charge fine and I have had no problems at all.Still too expensive for a battery."
2,Authentic Leica Product?,"I received my M8/9 Leica replacement battery on time. But upon opening the package, I noticed a couple things that caused me to question the authenticity.The original battery that came with my M9 was rated at 1800mAh. This battery was rated at 1860mAh.Packaging says M8. Odd that the older model camera battery would be coupled with a higher capacity battery.Second, the writing on the battery's back is in Russian.Third, the battery while packaged in Leica branded packaging, was crudely packed in cheap bubble wrap.So I really have no idea if I was sold an authentic Leica battery, or a cheap knock-off."
4,solid case,"i wanted to get away from my leather briefcase, i was starting to feel too old school. so i decided on aluminum. i looked at Zero Halliburton and couldn't believe how expensive they are. This is a solid case that has all the features of a typical leather case. sure the outside is going to get a bit scuffed and dented, but who cares? the case is well made and does the job. the locks are solid. only complaint is that the handle gets a bit ""stuck."" maybe some WD-40 would do the trick. if you are considering a reasonably priced case, this one is fine."
2,Drink & Wet is right...right away,"At first glance, you'd never know this is a drink and wet doll with it's soft body. It is cute and cuddly and my 22 month old daughter likes to carry her around.However, as a potty training aid it lacks completely. I thought this doll was broken when we tried to ""feed"" her the first time as it leaked all over the floor. I thought I overfilled it. I tried again and I saw it leaking out the bottom. Come to find out there is no resivoir to hold the liquid in for you to squeeze like the other drink and wet hard body dolls. This doll will not allow my daughter to ""teach"" the doll how to potty (using Dr. Phil's training method). Like the other reviewer said, you can't undress her as her clothes are her body except for the drop bottom flap and cute little rubbery bottom.I should have just spent the extra money and bought the actual potty doll.VERY disappointed, and it is a shame too because Goldberger has been around since 1916 and is well known."
3,potty so so,"I too tried to use this toy for our daughter for potty training...she is 28 months old and wants nothing to do with the potty...so i thought to try this doll. she wets right away and we get more wet than in the potty, i had to resort to putting my finger over the hole, nice! that's a way to teach my daughter a potty routine.on the only plus side, my daughter is a very motherly child and she loves to care for the baby, we just leave the clothes off of the baby to make pottying easier. she loves to feed the baby and put her to bed. this will be a toy that will last long for play, i am disappointed in the potty aspect of it though."
5,Robert Devoe,I'm a contractor and used this tool for its intended purpose of removing vinyl siding. It's a professional grade tool that works very good. I would recommend it for anyone who has to remove siding.
5,This is a must for doing a vinyl siding repair!!!!!,These tools are invaluable when doing a vinyl siding repair or replacing windows or doors on a vinyl-sided house. It works well to pop the siding loose and to re-hook the bottom edge during re-installation.
5,Right tool for the job,Worked like a charm for a small repair job and a duct/vent installation where I needed to remove some panels. The jobs would have been much more difficult without it. I don't have much experience with vinyl siding but I had no problem unlocking the panels with this little gizmo. I like that the handle is bright red too which will help when I need to find it again after not needing it for five years.
2,buy a Crow Bar,I had to remove a lot of 1980's vinyl from my house and was looking for a tool that would help. This tool did not. My Crow Bar did!
3,not needed,"While handy in a pinch, this tool is not needed if you are putting up new siding. That is what I was doing, and didn't need it once. I suppose that if you were repairing some siding, it may come in handy. I guess I will see down the line if that ever turns out to be the case. So if you want to spend the cash for this tool, the only downside would be that it will sit in your tool box and you may never need it."
4,Great little tool.,Before I found out about this tool I was trying to put the sideing back in with my hands. This tool is designed to do just that. Great little tool.
4,Easy to remove impossible to replace,The tool was easy to use when removing siding. I used it for Aluminum siding. But it was no help in putting the Aluminum back.
3,4AD Nostalgia,"Fans of the 4AD record label, especially those who feel that the label's output has waned since its '80s glory days will fall in love with Post to Wire. The disc has the same haunting production, ethereal vocals and sophisticated songcraft that you'd find on a Cocteau Twins or (especially) His Name is Alive LP. The first track is especially reminiscent of HNIA and definitely the pick of the album. Connoseiurs of dream-pop, though, will have little to complain about here."
4,All Hail to Heather Duby,"Now here is an interesting new cd that scorches past the predictable output of the competition (McLachlan, Crow, Jewel) and capitalizes on the techno-folkie movement started by Beth Orton. Very similar to Ortons' successful debut, ""Trailer Park,"" Duby combines ethereal vocals with electronic touches in songs that border on hypnotic. Check out ""Kensigton Place"" and the stunningly original ""A Healthy Fear of Monsters."" Watch your back Lillith girls because there is a new breed of singer/songwriters (Beth Orton, Lori Carson! , and now Duby)who are going to take music to places you and your record companies wouldn't dream of going. Get this cd!"
2,"Eloquently written, but not engaging","Gentlemen and Players begins in style: the setting is patiently and beautifully defined; the characters are well-introduced; and the central plot of the book--as described on the inside flap--is enough to keep any reader interested. However, after 100 pages of the 400 page book, I felt like the reader was still trapped inside the first 10 pages. The patient exposition that I had welcomed for 25 pages became downright annoying after 100. Joanne Harris writes well, but I feel that the same level of enjoyment could have been gleaned from a 200 page version of Gentlemen and Players instead of a 400 page version. Buy it if you'd like, but be prepared to skip a few irrelevant chapters in the middle to speed things along."
4,Worth Your Time,"An engaging book that twists and turns its way along a compelling story. I enjoyed the characters, their stories, and the plot twists. It was escapist fiction without being too much of a stretch. It is worth reading."
5,Loved it!,"What a great read! It was funny, sad, puzzling, suspenseful. The ending took me completely by surprise and made me want to pick it up and read it again with new insight. You think you've got it figured out? Well, you don't.Enjoy!"
4,Enemy lurking in the shadows,"A thrilling scholarly experience by Joanne Harris, master storyteller who tells the story of a long-time plotted revenge. The story is narrated from two alternate point of view: the plotter, hired in the privathe School of St. Oswald under a false identity, and an old schoolmaster nearing pension, threathened by the rise of new technologies and new department re-organizations. The plotter seeks revenge, and plans the ruin of the School itself, and does that by ruthlessly exploiting the secrets, the rivalities, the contrasts between students and teachers. The finale is memorable, and will be quite a surprise when the plotter's identity shall be revealed. This is an exquisitely crafted, insightful thriller, in wich the Author also tackles sensible issues like bullyism and social discrimination. I loved it!"
5,Such a great read!,"Even though several books have been described as a page-turner, this is the first book that I have read in a very long time where that description is apt. I truly could not put it down, it was that engrossing and suspenseful. I would read as much as I could, then put it aside, but then I just could not stop thinking about the storyline, and I just had to pick the book up again and continue reading. Please read this book for yourself and I hope you'll agree. It's wonderful!"
3,Fun but not her best...,"For fiction, story line starts well and then drifts into the unbelievable. Read author's Five Quarters of the Orange which is a superior work."
5,workings of a diabolical mind,"Joanne Harris, whose books have always been enjoyable, has taken her writing to a new level with this book. The story, which takes place at an elite boys' school, centers on the main character's desire for revenge. A sociopathic personality (if you ask me), the character, whose father is the school porter, masquerades as one of the students for years and pulls it off, using a fake name. This same person later returns as a teacher with the objective of destroying the school, for reasons not fully revealed until the end. The book shows in a most frightening way how easy it is to steal identities,falsely accuse people of crimes and destroy reputations in the computer age. You wont be able to put this book down and I'm not saying any more so as not to reveal specifics of the plot."
2,Tiresome Tale,"I read this book with my book club and I was one of eight who didn't like it. Perhaps the reason is I taught in an English public boarding school for several years and found the subject, good and evil, singularly uninteresting. The main character did not have enough motivation to wreak all the havoc he did. The story and the manner of its exposition was confusing and, for me ultimately unconvincing. Not enough emphasis was put on the main character's sexual identity issues. Pages and pages of missed opportunities for conflict. This book did not fly with me, at all."
3,Liked it but too many twists,"I bought this book because of the amazing reviews in the book's front matter. Although I enjoyed the book, I cannot sing the strong praises offered by other reviewers. There were many things I liked about it: particularly the view into a mysterious priveleged world and a game of players to figure out. However, the plot took one too many twists for my taste. This novel changed directions so many times, that it made the mystery's resolution seem implausable and frustrating to me, rather than elucidating. Still, if you are looking for a pleasant read that's a little bit different, this might be a good choice for you."
3,"Interesting, not gripping!","Lots of strong reviews and an enjoyment of the odd British mystery led me to think I would like this better than I did. Sort of plodded my way through it. Surprised and disappointed in the first 4/5ths, and honestly, a bit confused as to why. Wanted to weigh in on ""stars"". Might give it an extra half star for the last fifth."
3,Witty and stylish,"Joanne Harris writes entertaining books that show us the lighter side of the darker side of human nature. They're like Disney films from the 1980s polished up with a bit of literary verve. This book tracks the revenge plot against the stuffiest of English institutions, the public school, and in doing so, comments a bit on class differences and other stresses for children and adults alike. While it's an insightful look into the human soul, and Roy Straitley is a wonderful character, there's not that much of depth here, so I'd warn away people wanting a ""literary"" experience no matter what the jacket says. However, the clever, funny writing and density of vocabulary made this a wonderful read, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a rollicking good time. It's like the ""Pink Panther"" movies crossed with a Jane Marple novel."
4,Its a very big board,"This board took a lot of work to fit into the case I was using. Another Item I didn't notice was that the processor sits very far forward on the board. Combined with the size of the board, the processor and processor fan tends to interfere with any front drive bays. This really is more of a server board and should not be expected to fit into any non-server case without extensive modifications.That said, I needed a PCI-X slot for my 3ware RAID card and wanted to re-use my P4 and RAM from an older computer I was salvaging, so this fit the bill quite nicely, it just took some *cough* modification *cough* of the case to fit everything in.I'm going to try to find a server case that someone is trashing and move everything into that at some point mostly because this board is huge. It seems to work well though."
1,Confusing and Repetitive,"I am still not sure of the point Mr. Graham is trying to make. I don't know if he's sure why he wrote the book in the first place. He certainly does a lot of name-dropping. There has always been, and will always be, class distinction based upon income, education, family history, physical features, etc. It happens in every race and culture, and I am not surprised that it happens in the African-American race. I believe that many of the organizations that Mr. Graham allude to in his book were initially formed as ""support systems"" for those few Blacks who became educated and successful. During the early years, these organizations were probably nothing more than social clubs. But over years, I believe that many of the organizations' members have re-identified their main purpose and developed a social conscience. I hope that those of us who have blessed to find any degree of success and happiness, must realize that of ""much is given, much is expected""."
3,DISTURBING PORTRAIT OF BLACK AMERICA!,"I am a black college student at an Ivy League School. Currently, there is a book by Joseph Green called Pseudo Cool that is being passed around in our dorm. It's about how hard it is for Black students at predominately white educational institutions. But after recently reading Graham's book, I think that maybe African Americans need to look more at how we treat one another. This book is good though because it brings something to the light that needs to be looked at 'cause it forces us to look at ourselves."
2,This should be an article in a 1950s Negro women's magazine,"lawrence Otis Graham seems to have found his nitch,writing fiction about concepts that really interst no one except curious whites who will get a strange perspective on African Americans. Trite and potentially dangerous are the key words to describe this waste of paper. Some of the revelation should be of embarrasment. How could you identify a group as upper class when this group does not have large identifiable residential communities, no large bank that these so-called people own and information on test scores suggesting that some of the children of these people score lower on standard achiement test than lowewr class whites and asians. When Mr. Graham got his rhinoplasty, the physician should have worked on his brain. Princeton and Harvard wasted their time on him. Since he obviously was not going to make partner at the law form he ""left,"" this must be his new stock and trade. Get a real job Mr. Graham."
3,Why?,"Why are people so resentful of those who have done better in life? So someone has a better job, education, more money, and belongs to clubs. Why care? It doesn't affect your life. Every group of people has a class system, we are no different. Let people enjoy what they have worked hard for, what their parents and grandparents have worked for. No one should feel ""sorry"" for these people because they want to hang with each other, and not on the streets of Harlem. Stop the ""player hatin'"" people! And no one really cares about that whole light skin/dark skin thing. I have never felt I was treated differently by any black person because of how light my complexion is or isn't. Calm down everyone..."
3,Interesting initially then repititous,"This is indeed a very intresting book well researched by an insider.It became quite boring towards the end because it was repititive,then instead of analyzing so many cities it might have been better to just pick 2 or 3.I am amazed at the amount of activities from cradle to grave,every society creates their own aristocracy with strange inclusion and exclusion criteria which he alluded to.This is not where you would find solutions to problems facing Blacks today like increasing H.I.V,Lower life expectancy,employment,Computer gap,also you would not find explanations for why with all the parties there are not many African American owned hotel chains.I wonder why the mainstream organizations are against the school voucher program,when they send their own Kids to fantastic schools.This book is indeed recomended and discusses a bit about progressive organizations such as NAACP and UNCF."
4,good read,I got this as a present for my mum. She liked it. It details the unexpected and largely ignored US history of wealthy african americans during the 19th and 20th centuries.
4,Good Work!,Our Kind of People is very informative. I've learned a lot. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Graham's works.
3,"True, but necessary?","This book points out a lot of truths about the Black community, but is it necessary to really dwell on the negatives? It seems like sensationalism to me. If you're going to read about race, you'd be a lot better off listening to some other folks: Cornel West, Michael Eric Dyson, Farai Chideya--especially her new one ""The Color of Our Future""--Danzy Senna and the ""Black Genius"" compilation put out by Walter Moseley."
2,The Black Elite should toss Mr. Graham from their ranks!,"Our book club selected this book to read at our last gathering. We were all quite shocked and amazed at the high level of snobbery and uppityness that was portrayed in Mr. Graham's work. I commend his efforts to highlight some of the history behind the Black social organizations, schools, and vacation spots. I even enjoyed his chapter on the undercover world of those ""passing for white."" Those interesting tidbits, however, were more than overshadowed by the shallow and egotistical quotes from members of the elite. I didn't think that one of our own would write something that has the potential for being so divisive to our race. Mr. Graham has done this segment of our population a huge disservice. I'm sure they all aren't so petty......Can't we all just get along??????"
1,Too little analysis. Exhibitionistic.,"I grew up in the environment that Graham describes. However, I am not impressed with the book. The author has great material for a study and botches his effort by offering little analysis. He drops names and places, letting us know that he knows this world, but he does not offer much critical insight. He confuses time periods, talking about the Palmer Institute, or Camp Atwater or the importance of certain historically black colleges (Spelman, Howard), without volunteering key facts, such as that Palmer doesn't even exist any more. He doesn't touch on or analyze the tensions between Northern and Southern black elites. Ultimately, the book reads like a show and tell exhibit for white people and blacks who are not part of this world. It doesn't tell insiders anything they don't already know, and it doesn't offer the world at large any coherent ideas other than ""See, these people exist."" This simple notion does not sustain a whole book."
3,On and Off the Mark,"I grew up in the environment that Professor Graham writes about, however it was never really an issue. Everyone I associated with was just like me. Professor Graham is stuck on credentials and name-dropping, but he is like the majority of the middle to upper class in this regard, regardless of their skin's hue. I think it took alot of courage for the brother to write a book this controversial. While I do not agree with all Professor Graham's views, I do believe his book is fairly accurate and I enjoyed reading it."
1,All this fuss over one silly book!,"I had the good sense to take this book out of the library, instead of buying it. What a great decision! The contents of this book could have been summed up in a 5 page article!! I've seen Mr. Graham's other writings (e.g., U.S. News & World Report) and he seems obsessed with proving he belongs to the ""right"" group of people and distancing himself from blacks who haven't, in his eyes, ""made it"". Ho hum. We've gotten your message, Larry. I don't know why people are getting so upset about this silly piece of self-promotion. WHO CARES? If these people want to obsess over such trivial things as hair and skin color, college degrees, summer homes, who is ""in"" and ""out"", etc., I say, let 'em. I have more important things to worry about!"
3,......,"I read far enough in this book to become annoyed at the representation of my boarding school Madeira (McLean, VA). The author would have done well to have provided better documentation as to what time period he was dealing with in discussing Madeira's hostility towards black women. I experienced Madeira as one of the most liberal and diverse all female boarding schools on the East Coast. Such statements, without more background information, are a disservice to all the black women, like myself, who found success and close friendships during their sojourn on campus."
3,"Overall, worth the read, but take it with a grain of salt","I liked Mr. Graham's book. He writes very well and is brutally honest with himself at times. He seems to throw his observations of his experiences out to us and let us draw our own conclusions. I wonder if the irony of the black upper class experience is lost on him, though. Imagine, the Waldorf wouldn't let the ladies hold a function in its facilities until they found out if they were the ""right kind"" of black people, and the ladies were downright insulted. Then, these same ladies turn around and spend their time finding only the ""right kind"" of black people to belong to their exclusive clubs. It just goes to show that snobs come in all colors."
1,An Unworthy Effort,"This piece of trash should be re-named ""How to Succeed by Being White"" and include a fake Harvard degree; a mule-atto spouse; and the business card of a plastic surgeon."
1,"An uninformed, ridiculous tract","The author wouldn't know the black upper-class if he saw it. And his sources count for nothing, as most of them are wannabe types just like him. If his point is that educated and/or monied blacks can be just as shallow, stupid, status-minded and vulgar as their white counterparts, then the point is nicely taken. But the real problem here is the author's vision: he's in love with fancy labels, and bores the reader to death by ticking them off, page after page. Social mountaineering undercuts any pretension of genuine class; the most descriptive term is ""crass""."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this book.,"When I first read the title of the book, I thought pretentious all the way. However when I heard the author speak in person, I said maybe there is something I can learn from this book. I should have stuck with my first instinct. I found the constant name dropping and designer brand name references to be more than I could tolerate. Having grown up with and around many of the organizations the author refers to, I wonder if maybe I was living in some identical universe, because his experiences and mine were so far from the same. Save your money, please don't buy this book."
3,"Informative, if frightening","I guess there are people out there who really believe this stuff. Wow. Talk about division. I did find these tidbits about the upper class interesting. Much of their attitudes struck me as silly, but I won't take this out on the author.However, the author makes at least two references to Isabel Powell in which he describes her as the ""widow"" of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. She was actually the first of three or four wives. His widow would be whoever he was married to at the time of his death."
2,Repetitive and boring,"After reading Jill Nelson's Volunteer Slavery and Shirlee Taylor Haizlip's The Sweeter The Juice several years ago, this is repetitive and boring. By the end of chapter 2, I was only interested in skimming the remaining chapters. But it is indeed an important reference book and should be in all libraries, private and public."
3,Engaging yet sad book,"I cannot believe the vitriol directed towards Mr. Graham for writing Our Kind of People. He has attempted to chronicle the history and social mores of the black upper middle class, warts and all. The result is an engaging yet sad book that unveils the self-hatred that unfortunately permeates the black experience in this country.I don't view the book as merely a gossipy expose. Instead, I view it as a possible catalyst for black people to openly discuss the issues of skin color and class that halt us from making further progress together."
1,A Waste of Talent,"From what I've heard, Graham is originally from Mt. Vernon, New York. His father was a fireman and his mother sold encyclopedias. What I'd like to know is what college(s) did his parents graduate from and when? If his parents did not graduate from any of the colleges he references in his book, does that make him an ""insider wannabe""? It's bad enough other ethnic groups try to divide, destroy & disgrace the values and lifestyles of Africian Americans... it's more hurtful when it's ""our kind""."
1,Quite dull,"This guy really lays it on thick with the ""I know such and such"" name-dropping garbage. Irritating.He is so busy talking about his own life that the people he attempts to write about are diminished even more. I found this book very hard to read because of this.Not a smooth read at all. Use this book for the names only. It has no social value other than that. He would have been better off publishing his roledex in place of this book."
2,Not Quite Right,"With all due respect to Mr. Graham, I think that maybe he was honestly trying to take the reader on an historical journey to explain why the differences in social class within the African American race. Where he failed miserably is while trying to convey this central theme of class difference, he chose to intertwine his personal views and opinions within the text. The reader (myself) comes away feeling as if something is just not right with Mr. Graham......the feeling that perhaps Mr. Graham is a bit of a snob.I give it a 2-star rating simply because the cover looks really cute blended into my current cultural library of books. And also perhaps in the future I can use it as a demonstration to teach young African Americans how the mindset of some confused people (aka: Mr. Graham) can set out to destroy our spirits and divide our wholeness. Other than that, I cant really recommend it as solid reading material at all."
1,Those who know don't tell....,Those who know don't tell. And those who tell don't know. Enough said.
2,Subject was interesting....Book was not.,"Well, first off let me say this. The book itself was terrible. Graham was gossipy and the book was like reading a shout-out list. I read this book after reading some other ( and more informational) books on the subject, and I was thoroughly disappointed. I could go on about how disgustingly shallow he made the black-upper class, but that would be pointless. Also, Graham seems to be talking about a generation that was long ago. I seriously doubt that many of the ""elite"" feel the way some of the old timers do. Anyway, if you're looking for something informative and helpful, look somewhere else. Some of the stuff he talked about was common sense."
4,Good Book,"I was not raised in this group, but I am interested in them since some of my family are ""Black Upper Class"". I liked his book because he told the negative aspects of the group (his grandmother's insults against brown skin; the extreme--and to me--the nightmare/paranoid lifestyle of ""passing""), but at the same time he talks about the positive aspects of the group and he admits that he has not rejected the group--he is an active participant. That is refreshing. It is easy to be a Black nationalist on paper, then to be snobby in your everyday life. This author seems to be saying ""this is the truth I have experienced. This is the upper class. It is a pungent group. Make up your own mind whether you think it is a delicious or repugnant odor."""
3,Interesting...but,"I thought that this book was an easy read and very interesting, but I was expecting an analysis. The author basically provides the reader with some background information about exclusive organizations and gives the names and professions of some of their most prominent members. After reading the book, I knew the names and some historical background about the organizations founded by and for the Black elite, but I felt like the book was more of an overview rather than an ""inside look""."
2,It's A Shame,"You can't blame people for how they were raised but you can hold them accountable for their actions. Granted Mr. Graham thinks this is an important part of American History, but should we be proud of a group of people who bought in to and sold out to the dogma that whiter is better. How could the same group of people that judged based on skin color hipocritcally claim African heritage? The body is just a physical dress for the spirit and what ugly spirits these people have."
3,eye opener,"My oh my, this was an eye opener. There are the arrogant poor who disdain the upper class and there are the arrogant rich who disdain the poor.It's sad that dark color has been such an issue to blacks This is why wealthy our city blacks are insulted when asked to help (hands-on) in the projects. They can say they promote other blacks, but they will not get their hands dirty, unless it's a groundbreaking ceremony for a building named in their honor.After reading this book, I will forever see my black neighbors as hitting a glass ceiling erected by the more fortunate, and maintained by blacks who were born, ""up the hill.""Graham seems like a super nice guy, and seems aware (and a little apologetic) of his ignorance; but, he seems pretty out of touch with middle-class professionals. Too bad when parents so over-protect and brainwash children that they're afraid of being around ""people like us."" When we see a schizoid bag-woman on Peachtree St, we ought to see ourselves."
3,Interesting,"I first found this book to be interesting, then I found it repetative, tiresome, and boring. Also, I couldn't get a grasp on where the author was coming from. Is he now ashamed that he was a part of some of the intra-racism that was going on? Is he proud of his ""upper middle class"" ties? Is he still striving to be a part of this group? I couldn't really read between the contradictions. Also as other reviewers put it, he does seem to be about 10 to 15 years behind the curve on what's really going on in ""Black America"". This could've been an article in ""Ebony"" magazine about 35 years ago and been right on time.It did open up some interesting dialoug, and I did enjoy the pictures. It's almost like looking into my own family album."
1,"Very elementary and in many instances, inaccurate.","I cannot believe that an African American wrote this book. Does the author really know his history of how we Blacks got to be ""blue bloods"". Is he really proud of the white blood that runs through his veins? Does he realize that someone was raped in order to have the straight hair, the light skin, etc.? He needs to read, read, read, and then try again to write a book with a little more substance. We cannot put him in the same class with our outstanding Black writers. Maybe in Mr. Graham's next book, he will come out and let us know where the roots of his inferiority lie. Believe me ""we all (Blacks) will go when the wagon comes"", and maybe the author will learn this before the wagon comes for him, for it surely will. I feel sorry for him and all of those he write about."
1,Self serving,"Despite my upbringing in a Jack and Jill/Delta Sigma Theta/Guardsmen/Girl Friends/Smart Set/Tuskegee/Camp Atwater home, I am delighted not to consider myself in the same ""High Yeller"" society as the author. I know many of the families mentioned in OKOP, but they are not as described (thank goodness)! Perhaps the author should realize that Black Society (at least most of it) went through slavery, racism, Jim Crow, etc. and survived. Maybe he needs a true black experience.As to the book, it could (and should) have been a lot shorter. It became very repetitive, with only the names and cities changing."
1,Tabloid History,"I agree that the attacks on Mrs. Otis-Graham are harsh considering her only crime is loving an unrepentent snob but, when the author himself mentions (time and again) that she too is a Harvard grad--she becomes fair play for ridicule. If she had nothing to contribute to the book, why does her mention her and her education like they are the only black people to ever graduate from Harvard? I read this book. It was okay. It's not worth this much cyber-ink."
1,"Dated,inaccurate,sloppily written ""slam"" book","I rated this book as a ""1"" because ""0"" was not an option. I have lived in Atlanta for 34 years and can speak with some authority. There are many, many errors in this account. An immediate example that comes to mind is the listing of Mrs. H.Nash Chisholm as Mrs. H. Chisholm Nash. The hackneyed writing was tiring with phrases repeatedly begining with ""such as"" and overuse of ""like."" This writer will never have to answer the call offering a literary prize. Now to content: E.Franklin Frazier offers the classic treatment on this subject. This book hasn't come close to changing that. The insecure, pitiful people who need this kind of crutch,(the clubs, color, hair) I feel do no harm to others, they just harm themselves."
4,A must have,"There were a few errors, but the only people who wouldn't enjoy this book are the people who are in the 90%. The Talented 10% should relate to and enjoy it. A classic."
4,Intriguing,"I have not yet finished this book, but it is fascinating. I currently reside in the deep South and one forgets or doesn't really know about generations of the Black upper class. I hope they can keep up the excellent values they have bestowed on the younger generations through the years."
3,Too much material....,"Hey I love a good book and this one would have been good if the author didn't try to tell us every little minut detail. It took me forever to get through it. It's interesting to know about these groups (although I've known about most of this already from family members) but as the saying goes, 'Rome wasn't built in a day.'"
3,To The Reader From Boston,"While you are so busy trying to correct someone else's punctuation, perhaps you need to take the time to check your own. People come here to get opinions on books, not to read your chastisments..."
2,This may be the most boring book I have ever read,"This may be the most boring book I have ever read! If you're interested in the topic, save your money, go to the book store, and just read the introduction and preface there. There's no need to read any further, the rest of the book just repeats these two segments, over and over again."
1,BORING,so what if there are rich blacks or rich whites. the money spends the same. the book was boring boring boring. maybe the author ought to stick with subjects he knows something about.
1,obnoxious and sterotyping subject matter,"This book is a poor excuse for a view inside the Black Upper Class. While some comments and descriptions were true, the content was to the point of being ridculous and embarrassing. I speak from experience having been a member of many of the organizations mentioned in the book."
3,Such a shame!!,"It is such a shame that in this day and age there are still some people of color that still feel the need to distance themselves. I actually brought this book about a year after it was published. After reading it the one thing that stuck out to me was the fact that no matter how much I tried as a black woman I would never belong. ( mind you these are a group of black families we are talking about). For so many years we as black people in this country have had to deal with discrimination on all sorts of levels, but to hear that it still exits and in our own communities. I for one am truly saddend. The only answer I can come up with is the need for these people to feel superior to someone."
2,Repetitive....Repetitive,"Graham's obsession with Ivy League schools and pedigree is nonsense. While a student at Morehouse College, I was mentored by a distinguished dark-skinned Constitutional Law Professor.( Any Morehouse Man and Spelmanite would know to who I am referring.)He taught us never to be impressed with anyone claiming to have Harvard or Yale credentials. Why? Those schools produced numerous Supreme Court Justices who wrote the dissenting opinions to further oppress the black masses in this country. It will take more than a Ivy-League degree to impress this MOREHOUSE MAN!PS. That secret isn't taught at Harvard."
3,Revealing Writing...But Nothing New For African-Americans,"Graham airs what can be considered ""dirty laundry"" within the African-American community regarding the emphasis on skin complexion and social/economic status. Whereas, the latter has been a determining factor within most ethnic groups, the attention he grants the subject of skin complexion is adequately explained and truly authentic. Graham's writing is a bit tedious and eventually becomes repetative. However, I marginally recommend it to younger readers who may not be familiar with the ""paper-bag test"" or even the existance of a ""Black Elite"". More mature readers may also use some of the references to ""The Boule"" and ""The Guardsmen"" as motivation to further explore the significance and history of such organizations."
1,This is a bunch of hot air arrogance.,"Our kind of people, what arrogance? What contributions did your kind of people make to anyone other than their little circle. I didn't waste my time to finish reading this book. It was wacked right from the pictures."
3,RELAX PEOPLE!!!!,"I read the book and found it to be an interesting peace of our history, and again this is a small segement of African American history. Many of the people writing these reviews have deep rooted feelings, which I do not feel should be directed towards a book. I like the fact that an author decided to write about our (African American)wealthy side of history, which is far to often neglected. Yes, his views are heavily intertwined, but all books have the authors view present. I appreciate the fact the author has lived the topic, he is addressing. I wish he would have presented more dates and times, to give the reader a better historical account. Take the book with a ""grain of salt"" and read as much about our history as possible. Again, this is a small segement of our (African American) culture, which is readily evolving."
3,Hilarious. Give a whole new meaning to the term Brown nose.,"A well written and well researched book on a group of people who take themselves much too seriously.The so called ""Talented tenth"" spent much of their time, energy and resources following the Civil War disassociating itself from the remaining 90 percent they considered rabble. To what end?As I read this book in 2011 it is not lost on me that the son of a White Woman and native Kenyan holds the most powerful office in the world. It is ironic that President Obama is a man whose pedigree would not pass muster with the social climbing snobs chronicled in this book while the best that their own progeny have ever achieved is to serve at the pleasure of the very people whose social customs and rankings they take pains to scrupulously ape. I'd say that is poetic justice."
2,It's interesting what passes for elite in Graham's acc't....,"Accomplished these folks may be, but Rockefellers and Rothschilds they are not. Nor are they seriously wealthy and connected like many Africans I've met. Upper middle class is a better word. That said we're all God's children and the divisions we create are surely contrary to His purposes for our lives."
3,Having their cake and eating it too,"The book is an interesting read, although the constant name-dropping is extremely tiring. I find it fascinating that the black elite want to have their cake and eat it too--they aspire to be white&elite yet ostracize other elite blacks who live in predominantly white neighborhoods or attend ivy schools. They look down upon wealthy blacks who do not belong to all the ""right clubs"" but do not seem to realize that belonging to the ""right club"" does not make them any more in touch with the common american black experience."
1,A lightweight treatment with obvious selfserving overtones,"Let me get this correctly. I am a middle-aged, dark skinned African American male, whose parents were both college educated professionals (nurse and engineer) but not wealthy; I graduated summa cum laude from a respected HBCU, but not Howard; received a Big Ten university (but not Ivy League) law degree; am a member of an exclusive, predominantly white private club (but not a frat); earn over 1/4 million dollars annually as a corporate executive; am a tithe-paying member of my church (but not Episcopal); a loyal, once-married husband (to an African American woman who would not be mistaken as otherwise); however, I would never be accepted by the so-called African American ""elite."" My question is: should I care?"
3,This book needs a sequel!,"While LGO did a lot of research and provided a good perspective of America's Black Upper Class there was a lot more information that should be included in this book. I realize that you can't include all of the necessary players but I believe there were some very important players that were not included that could have provided a more complete picture of this exclusive segment of Black history. Specifically, the ommission of Boyd family in Nasvhille. Also, what about the famous architect from Los Angeles. There was no mention of him at all in the Los Angeles chapter. I also found some errors in the book that would not be obvious to the general public. Overall...this was an excellent publication that just opens the doors to one of the many issues that prevents the Black community from working collectively to achieving the rewards that are due to us."
3,an eye-opening and informative read,"while reading this book, i could not help to be astonished by the class prejudices that we have among ourselves as blacks. i found this book to be an informative read above all. just because Otis writes about class differences, prejudices, and put-downs does not mean we have to adhere to them. if anything this book inspired me to overlook socio-economic differences in our community. what i find as disheartening, are the reviews on this website. most of them briefly refer to book and then continue to name call and put down certain classes and groups. why? that does not change anything, least of all what one thinks. the purpose of this book, hopefully is to initiate discussion not name-calling. if you are disgusted with the class system that Otis presents then do something active to change it. Make a difference, be active and go against the grain. Don't simply call people names on this website."
1,Stark nonsense,"This book is an idiotic paean to ""good old days"" of segregation, when Graham's subjects had a tiny black corner of America all to themselves, where they could lord it over the less fortunate. As things now stand, this group wields no real influence, has no real money, and exists entirely on the faded glory of a time long passed, thank God. They count for nothing in the modern world, and someone should inform Graham of this fact so that he can stop ""foolishly looking up""."
1,Black Trash.,"Having worked with Mr. Graham in a pretigious NY lawfirm, I can attest to the fact that he himself is every bit as pretentious and mean spirited as the upper class families he chronicles in this garbage. This is a man who tried (and failed) tirelessly to get into the white ""in-circle"". When this failed, he wrote a trashy expose . Now, it appears the L.O.G tried to pull the same fete with the darker ""in-club"" Once again, in spite of his whiter than thou wife, disfiguring plastic surgery,andIvy League degree, he was unable to get in. Mr. Graham desperately wants all of us to know who is he--an thankfully this time his dream has come true...he is a top notch as*hole and will be until the day he dies. I pray that he has a good and virtuous nanny to care for his son."
5,Greenpeace caelndar is the best year after year,I make a point of getting these calendars every year. The pictures are fabulous and everyone always wants to leaf thru it. Plus the proceeds go to charity.
4,Very nice.,"Although I agree that some of the recipes do suffer from lack of fat and texture, this is a treat just to read. It stresses the importance of fresh ingredients, and uses spices and cheeses to enhance dishes, not overpower them. The philosophy of the spa is carefully presented, and the reader is encouraged--not lectured--to try a new, healthier way of eating and living. A good find."
4,This book is required for any serious cook!,"Bill Wavrin is a GREAT chef. I have been fortunate to have tasted his food at Rancho La Puerta, and it is wonderful. In his book, he recreates many of the flavors I remember and cherish from my visits to the Ranch. Even more important, he credits his staff substantially (and correctly}. Bill never acted like a ""star"" chef although he truly is a star. The recipies are great, and have wonderful asides with important information. My only complaint is that there are no great color pictures of the food or the ranch itself."
5,Porter-Cable 7424 polisher,"I purchased this item from Tool Plus for only $109 and $6.50 for shipping. This was the lowest price that I was able to find online, and I have not been disappointed with my purchase. I use a Dewalt DW849 high-speed orbital buffer (I LOVE IT) to polish and wax vehicles, but I wanted a random-orbit polisher specifically for darker colors and wax removal.If you want to polish/wax your car at home this is perfect because it doesn't cost much, is easy to use, and is virtually foolproof. I would also recommend using a Lake Country Velcro backing plate and CCS Smart Pads with the 7424. Then just get good chemicals and you are good to go."
1,This price is a joke,"I am writing this review because the markup on this tool is ridiculous. I did research on what polisher to buy about 2-3 months ago. I stored this link as it was looked up to a fair amount and at the time listed for 75 dollars - that's right 75 dollars. I came back to a 350-some dollar tool? WHAT!?Look anywhere but here for this tool. CoastalTool currently has it at just over 100 - still not as low as it should be, but 350-some dollars?! Are these people NUTS? DON'T BUY IT FROM THIS SELLER. NO POLISHER IS WORTH 350 dollars! TOTAL rip-off"
5,How To Remove Swirls using the Porter Cable Dual Action Polisher,"the Porter Cable Dual Action Polisher is an awesome tool that almost anyone can learn to use to remove swirls and scratches. I've been using one for about 15 years and have even written and produced a how-to DVD for using this tool which can be found in my Amazon Store here.https://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/ts/exchange-glance/Y02X3281978X2914969/002-0698807-7850407I promise you'll learn how to get professional results faster by watching this ""How-To DVD"" than by reading about it or trial and error.Mike Phillipswww.ShowCarGarage.com"
1,Broke the second time I used it,Polisher broke the second time I used it. I will be looking for another brand.
3,Too much dust !.. Check out other sanders in the market.,"If you are planning to use this sander for woodworking, I would say, To save your lungs, Check out Ridgid ROS or Bosch as they have a vaccume adapter but cost just little more.I bought this to sand the panels and amount of dust made me to stop using it for woodworking.It works great for polishing cars etc. I wish i would have bought the one with vaccume adapter.I like PC tools but this sander did not impress me at all. I can say that this is a basic sander and because of dust it creates, I am barely using it now.Random orbit Ridgid Sander I bought at Home Depot is simply the best you can buy to sand flat panels. ( Made in Germany )"
2,Good for a car that doesnt need polishing.,"Lots of great reviews here. Thats because these cars do not need real polishing. This unit will not ""cut"" paint like a reguar unit will. I even took the scientic approach. I bought some 3m compound designed to clean up 1200 grit wet sanding. I then wet sanded a fender using 1500 grit paper. This unit will not TOUCH a wet sanded finish. Its ridiculous.. I should have read all these glorious reviews closer.. this is nothing more than a high end waxer that you could buy for $20 at your local autozone. Also Toolking has really bad advice.. they dont know what this unit does and sold me products that do not work with an orbital.. so now I am out a bunch o money.. I'll probably ebay the stupid thing and go a buy a REAL polisher."
1,Waste of money,"Me and my friend have both tried buffing our cars, this sucks. terrible experience, don't bother using this buffer or buffers period. TRUST ME."
5,Great Product,"Used this polisher with Sonus polish on my Black 2002 Acura MDX. I almost couldn't believe it was the same vehicle, the shine was amazing. There is no way I could have gotten the same results by hand. This polisher did a great job, was easy to work with and made a difficult job easy. I strongly recommend it."
2,Not so great,"I was surprised to find that, unlike other buffers, the pad oscillates but is not really attached to the motor shaft, so any heavy polishing causes the pad to stop spinning. The motor does not sound good when it runs, it has a cheap Chinese product sound. It starts with a jolt spraying the compound everywhere. Speed control at it's lowest setting is still much to fast. Crummy pad supplied cannot be removed from the backing pad.OK for light polishing but the polishers with slow-start and slower speeds are a better choice."
5,great,"Never used a buffer / polisher of any kind before. But with a little practice, trying the different polishes and waxes, I was able to create the shine I was looking for. I just recently had my motorcycle repainted with a custome paint job, I was a little nervous, but to my amazement, It looks great. This polisher is great for any noob like myself."
4,Automobile Polisher,I own 2 black cars so keeping them looking good takes some effort. I was seeking a polisher that was easy to use and didn't leave swirl marks on the finish. I was able to get professional results with the Porter-Cable Orbital Polisher and was very pleased with the quality and handling of the machine.
2,good songs,"cd was in very good conditions, too bad I was not able to get the list of songs in it, was missing the song I was looking for!!"
4,Superb,"I found it difficult to believe that this was a live recording. Only during the piano intro of Beautiful Love did it sound live. Well worth the price especially if you like a cross between tradition and contemporary jazz. Peter has always impressed me with his tasty guitar licks and the non-selfish way the other musicians are showcased. I saw Peter live in Phoenix about 5 years ago and have been a fan since, unfortunately I was on vacation from Florida, maybe he'll get out here soon. Great stuff.Steve Amari"
2,Respool After First Trip,"Got the 20# line a while back and finally spooled last week before trip. Line is real nice looking and managed to get about 450yds on my ABF90. Line seemed a little thinner than my usual 20# Ande Tournament and stretchy while spooling. Trolled a medium ballyhoo and hooked up on a average king mackerel of 37"". Fought in fine, but I felt like the line could snap anytime. After releasing the fish, I inspected the line and noticed it was unusable after just one fish. My usual Ande line could handle a fish twice that big and not be deemed unusable. No thanks on a reorder."
1,Are you joking? This book was awful,"This book read as if it had been written by someone in junior high. I literally went through the book and crossed out all the terrible grammar and the word ""even"" before throwing it away. I usually like true crime stories, but this one was so terribly written that I couldn't enjoy the story."
3,Questions,"I thought this book was quite good,however I for one would certainally question any woman that had been married 6 times!!!!!!!!! I sure would think there would be a problem with her. Also the author describes her as this BEAUTY, PLEASE, I think not. When she learned of the Doctors past wife with a broken nose a would think a flag would have risen for her. MONEY, MONEY, MONEY. She gets no simphy from this reviewer. All in all a well written book. I would recommend it to all."
2,kawasaki tastes like saki,"As far as wine vintages go 1997 was a bad year in Bordeaux and perhaps as well this cd. Though i truly respect Kawasaki's guitar virtuosity and compostion skills, the music lacks a real backbone and gives way to a schmaltzey, schmazzy aesthetic. Not to diss Ryo because the guy can play and Radha Shoottom on vocals is amazingly smooth but you wonder why is he messing around with this and not experimenting and producing music that really soars."
2,Warning: Cannot operate DVD and VCR---only one!,"I suppose the description technically says this, but it's not highly clear: This remote cannot operate BOTH a VCR and a DVD. It can do one or the other. The 3 modes this remote can operate are: TV, CABLE, and VCR-OR-DVD. (I have a combo TV/VCR/DVD, and this remote cannot operate all 3; it will only do the TV and VCR. So if you have a VCR and a DVD player, this remote will not operate both of them.) I am returning this remote, and will purchase a model that the Phillips' help desk clerk recommended."
1,unusable,"After receiving this item without the codes, it proved useless when they were sent to me. I kept it because I could not take the hassle of returning it."
5,A must for music lovers,"This is how to enjoy various music pieces and fantastic video. Too short, would have loved more. A great value."
3,It seems too short. May be good as a demo disk,I was expecting a little more from this blu-ray. It's kinda short. The singing is good and the quality is good but this seems like it wasonly meant to be a demo disk.
2,"blue ray experience, opera and ballet",Selections are nice but they are very brief. I would have expected lengthy selections. Doesn't matter if they belong to a lower number of events.
3,Cool but not awesome.,There are a couple of goods scenes but in general it is only a preview for using BLUE RAY. It's OK.
4,It is a fine DVD,"Recently, I bought a new TV and a blu ray DVD player. I also have a decent suround sound 7.1 system. the purpose for me to buy this DVD is to check the audio effect from blu ray DVD. After watching the DVD, I found the video is very good, as expected. the pictures are very clear with HD. the Audio is not as good as I expected. I cannot tell different in sound between the Blu Ray DVD and regular DVD. This may be because the recording equipment or setup is not the best, or the lower sample rate was used. Overall, for so low price, it is worth buying and have a taste."
5,Watch Case,This is a great watch case. Now I can place my wathces in something rather than having them layed out all over my dresser. The delivery was very fast and I recommend the seller to anyone.
4,Very Nice,"I ordered this case so that my boyfriend would finally have a (nice) place to keep his watches. We were looking for something nice but not to pricy and this is it. The case looks just like the pictures, if not better in person, and we were both very pleased with it. If you're at all skeptic, don't be. This is a great buy."
3,Ok for seldom use,The product was not well made. I use it to store my seldom use watches just so they stay clean. Get something better for everyday use. I suppose the one good thing is that it is small and compact.
4,Good Gift,"It's a good case for the price you pay for it, relatively inexpensive and it shows. I almost broke the key off in the lock when trying to lock it for the first time... I wouldn't recommend using that function....All in all nice product for the $"
3,Seemed kinda cheap,I got this to give as a gift. Kinda felt bad about it once it arrived. Not as well built as expected.
3,sharp-looking for the price,"It's an unassuming, elegant display case that feels pretty sturdy for the price point. It's not ment to be luxurious, which is ideal for showcasing the watches and having their dials stand out. It is also rather elegant for the price, although the sh./& handling cost was ridiculous. Still, now five of my watches look very sharp. Great item for begginer watch collectors like me."
2,"Customer service was great, but product was cheap.",The product was not well made. The shipping was outrageous. The hinges were something you might find on a little girls toy music box and there was a seam in the back that was quite visible. I found better quality for same price. Customer service was super about it and gave me a quick return.
1,Small watch box,"I purchased this a little less than a year ago. SInce then, i've prchased several ""modern"" watches w/ a larger face (40 mm & up).They don't fit well in this box if you put 2 40mm or larger watches side by side. It's really designed for 25mm to 30mm.Also, the clasp / latch on the front is poorly made."
4,"Nice, simple watch case","This is a nice and simple case to display your watches in. It is made of somewhat cheaper materials, but still looks good enough. The fact that the top window is made of class and not plastic is a plus. Overall, I'm happy with this case."
5,still the best source of balanced info. on home schooling,"As a scholar, working as an associate professor of cultural and interdisciplinary studies at Antioch College, I have a student population that contains a large number of home schooled students. Much has been published in recent years on home schooling, but this balanced collection remains the best source of information available on home schooling. It includes information on state regulation, historical context, the reality of particular family's experiences, the motivations of different groups heavily invested in home schooling, etc...For any academic undertaking a study of home schooling, for any parent considering home schooling of their own child or children, I highly recommend a serious reading of this definitive book."
3,Old orchid classic,"Orchids of Guatemala and Belize is an old classic, with several volumes which have been reprinted in a softcover, low cost format. It's useful, however most of the taxonomy is outdated. This is a volume that surely is a good acquisition for any orchid library, and good value in the relation to the low cost and thickness, however the reader should not expect many illustrations. There are no pictures, and only a limited number of line drawings in relation to the total number of species covered."
3,A bi-coastal mystery,"The possibilities are all there at the beginning. A young newly-widowed mother, Nora, and her 11-year old son, Jason, are befriended by a neighbor, a black man who offers to check on Jason while Nora works. An element of racism is introduced when both Nora and her neighbor, Edward Bishop, begin receiving hate mail. It would seem that they are being watched. They are. The culprits eventually get to Edward, whom they brutally murder, then move on to the next prey, Jason, home alone. As the men are stalking Jason, I kept thinking, why doesn't he do this or that, but it doesn't matter, because of course they find him and wait for his mother. The story becomes bi-coastal when Nora's parents in Seattle are drawn into the picture. Apparently Nora's dead husband has something to do with all this. After a bloody, facile ending Nora and Jason are rescued as are the grandparents in Seattle. So what did the hate mail have to do with the story? Nothing."
2,A classroom exercise in creating tension and nothing else.,"This reading experience was a dissappointment. While the tight writing keeps the reader's interest, the people do not. Bausch, who is capable of drawing a reader into incredibly complex ethical situations, does none of that here. And, while we can all get at least a little excited about pure mayhem, this unrelieved hostage tale provides no such excitement. No moral tension, because there are no moral people. Just grossly denegrating behavior--homosexual rape of an eleven year old, illicit fingering of his mom, violent deaths---why? No, I cannot recommend this one even though I very much admire the author's ability, in his short fiction, to place the reader in a specific part of the human experiment with stories that haunt."
3,Brings Nothing New to the Genre,"This is a very well-written thriller, but it brings nothing new to the genre. I can't complain about the prose, which is full and efficient. I wish Richard Bausch would stick with short stories, or at least stories with gentler and less generic themes."
2,not what I thought,"I too loved Happy Birth Day, but this book just makes having a younger sibling seem like a negative experience. When I read it with my 3 yo I have to leave out parts that are too negative. The child in the book acts out badly in light of all the attention the new baby is getting...going as far as wearing baby's hat acting like a baby herself and competing for attention in bratty ways. I'm not saying this won't happen in my own family...but who wants to give their preschooler these ideas?Almost every page is a picture of the older child making a snotty face at the baby..even at the end..she never really accepts the new baby."
2,Another overly negative book for new siblings,"Our family loves the book Happy Birth Day by the same author and illustrator, so I was delighted to see Hi New Baby! on the bookstore shelf -- it even features the same family as Happy Birth Day. However, when I read this book, I was very disappointed -- like too many other books in this genre, it dwells very heavily on the negative feelings an older child has about a new baby, and only on the last page is any positive feeling expressed. Of course it's important to acknowledge the negative feelings an older child will have -- but a book that presents a more balanced picture of feelings about new siblinghood, such as Joanna Cole's books I'm a Big Brother and I'm a Big Sister, or Martin Waddell's lovely book When the Teddy Bears Came, seems much more appropriate and comforting reading for siblings-to-be."
2,Low budget...WRONG TRANSLATIONS,"This had such great reviews to motivate me to order for my son. My wife commented on the low budget and then found out they did not translate many words accurately from English to Spanish (she is Hispanic, so she would know). So If you are looking for accuracy, it is best to look elsewhere."
4,Mighty Spiders,Excelent book about spiders for the young. Pictures are wonderful. This book is truely for young readers interested in spiders. Keeps them interested without boring them.
4,Australian SF Reader,"A complex tale that is a sequel to the Destiny Makers, as travellers return to Earth many centuries later to find a lot of changes.Some people in charge don't like such wild cards. One man's relationship with a woman will become important, as he is determined to be the appropriate genetic match for her. It is likely to be dangerous for him, however."
4,sweet,you cant NOT smile when you see Joe Swanson!!! I LOVE family guy..and bought this as a holiday gift for my 11 year old son. He wants to collect the whole set!
2,Universal's Second Monster Mash,"This 1944 follow-up to ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" lacks the moody atmosphere and slickness of its predecessor. ""House of Frankenstein"" wastes the Universal gallery of monsters in a terribly contrived story. Though Boris Karloff returns to the fold as Dr. Niemann, the actor wishes he were in another film - preferably a Val Lewton production. Director Erle C. Kenton would do a better job with the immediate sequel, ""House of Dracula"" (1945)."
1,The films ran out of stories to tell,"House of Frankenstein showed how the film makers of these movies started to run out of ideas on how to keep Dracula, the Wolf-Man, and the Frankenstein creature interesting. Although listed as a sequal to Frankenstein meets the Wolf-Man, it pays litte attention to keeping the contiunity of the two films in check. There is no second great battle between the Wolf-Man and the Frankenstein creature, and in the end the two monsters die unconvinceing deaths (althugh they appear alive again in the next film, House of Dracula which is not much better then this movie."
3,"ridiculous, but fun and nostalgic","This one has em all: an evil genius bent on revenge, his murderous hunchback henchman, Frankie, Wolfie, Drac, and a sappy love story with a gypsy. They all happen to be in the same country, almost like neighbors, and ride around in a caravan (stolen from a murdered Ralph Richardson), and keep on blundering onto oneanother, rediscovering the secrets of Frankenstein's technologies and writings (undisturbed and waiting for the picking). All sorts of murderous things happen, but nothing that would stop yet another knockoff (yes, House of Dracula) a few years later. Carradine is not a great Drac, Karloff is the evil doc instead of the monster, but Lon is back as Wolfie.It all adds up to an incomprehensible mix, but what can I say? I saw it on a sleepover with one of my best pals (who had 4 beautiful sisters), and vaguely remembered it for almost 45 years. Thus, while laughing with my kids, I found it thoroughly enjoyable and completely inane."
3,Good actors; poor movie,"I watched this with my daughter to get in mood for Halloween. We got this as a second movie along with ""Wolfman meets Frankenstein"" and watched them back to back. Now the first movie was not so bad. It provided a real contrast with ""House of Frankenstein""; vividly showing how bad the latter is!The three star are just to show respect for the actors and the monsters. Hey if I were Dracula I would be mad. I mean he got fried because we was a bad coach driver? I would have expected more from the count. Why didn't he wear a watch and fly off to some hole before sun came up! Wolfman gets slightly better treatment. Now I have seen worse monster movies. But this one is pretty much at the bottom. Its place is the second movie in a monster double feature."
3,Good have been better,Karloff plays a truly evil mad scientist in this the first of Universal's monster team up. John Carradine as Dracula was a joke. They should have got Bela Lugosi.Glen's Frankenstein didn't do much but lay around;and Chaney's wolfman was lame to. It seems to me that Universal was just cranking these last two pictures out to make money. They weren't bad but the were by no mens as good as the earlier films
3,An enjoyable Hollywood monster bash.,"Escaped convict Karloff, along with hunchbacked assisstant, revives Dracula and the Wolfman and Frankenstein's creature to kill the men who were responsible for his imprisonment. Action and pathos intertwine as the film draws to a stunning climax."
2,cheap,This product is very cheaply madeThey bent the first time I tried to use themOnly use on very thin metal or plastic
1,Useless Lid,The lid does not seal tight. This thing is crap. Why have a big plastics lid that's difficult to remove if it doesn't seal properly?
2,Dimensions misleading,"It's a great dish but it doesn't solve my issue at all. I ordered this because it is dimensioned as 10.4 x 6.5 x 8.4 inches and I assumed it was 6.5"" tall. It is not, it's only 3"" tall. I wish all the pyrex dishes were clearly and correctly dimensioned!"
1,Chinese manufactured garbage,"I LOVE the OLD pyrex. It was the BEST but this new stuff must be made in China and is garbage. If you are lucky enough to have some of the old containers all you have to do is hold them next to the new ones and you will see the difference. The old ones are clear and the new ones have a blue cast to the glass. For some reason the blue tint in the glass weakens it but somehow makes it cheaper to produce. From what I've read all colored glass is more fragile especially when subjected to heat but I have to tell you, it also chips with just regular use. I've never had any of the old pyrex chip. Also, the lids for the new ones are EXTREMELY stiff and very difficult to get on to the containers. I even had one lid split because it would not stretch. Somehow this new stiffer plastic is cheaper to make just does not make a good product."
2,Arrived damaged.,This arrived with a manufacturers defect (a chip under the lid). The two Glass Lock containers I ordered at the same time arrived in mint condition.
5,Great Product,"These glass storage containers are great for anyone wanting to get away from storing your food in plastic. The only plastic part is the lid which seals tight after each use, but doesn't come in contact with food."
5,Perfect Size,I love this pan... works great and is the perfect size for baking a meal and having leftovers for 2 people.
1,DANGEROUS,"In case you haven't read the January issue of Consumer Reports yet, let me summarize: Corning sold Pyrex to World Kitchen, who is using cheaper glass which makes it more likely to shatter from heat. The European Pyrex still uses the traditional Pyrex formula and is as heat-resistant as ever. Consumer Reports says: ""We baked at least five samples of each brand in a 450-degree oven. All of the U.S. Pyrex and Anchor dishes shattered when placed on the wet countertop. None of the European dishes ... broke""Amazon sells the European product:Arcuisine Elegance Glass 2.8 Quart Rectangular Baker"
4,Love IT!,"I have recently decided that glass is the way to go to microwave, and bake! This is a perfect size for two large portions or four medium portions. This allows me to make and save two portions for my husband and I, and more for later. Clean up is always a breeze. Even the most baked on crust, let to soak five minutes in hot sudsy water and it comes clean as a whistle. My husband who hates to clean this type of item, even says it's a breeze. Now that's high praise!"
5,Sheer Maximo-Brilliance,"The sixth single taken off Newcastle band Maximo Park's critically acclaimed album, A Certain Trigger, ""I Want You To Stay"" the album's melancholic love song, the lyrics reading like a classic Morissey masterpiece. With Maximo Park's album being the triumph it is, it is quite fair to say that any song could be released as a single, but the decision to to make ""I Want You To Stay"" a single produces a reaction of ambivalence: it is hardly a surprise - because it is in fact so damn good - but at the same time, it does seem an unpredicted move on the part of the band, since it has less twists and jerks than most of their songs. But perhaps that was the reason ""I Want You To Stay"" was released. It is as if the lads are saying, ""Look here, we are very much capable of variety, thank you"". If the The Field Music/J Xaverre Mix isn't reason enough to go get this album (which it is), it must be bought for ""La Quinta"", which is just sheer Maximo-brilliance."
5,Sway Deluxe,"Delightful selection of music done before, but with a new twist. Very much enjoy their harmonies and humor. Charming and cheeky, like the Ditty Bops, they truely entertain my socks off!"
5,Puppini Sisters are Dynamite!,"From beginning to end...triple digit dynamite! Listened almost nonstop from Wa, thru OR, ID, WY, over the Grand Tetons, thru Yellowstone, into MT and back to WA. I need MORE! When???"
4,Reminds You of A Different Era!,"While the Puppini Sisters have recorded old classics and even modern contemporary hits in this compact disc, they have harmony and sing well enough. They take after the American Andrew Sisters but what about the British Beverley Sisters who also sing ""Sisters"" just as well.Anyway, the sounds of their voices are fine. Their selection is both old fashioned and contemporary with renditions of Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"" in their own unique way and Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" as well. Their first song is ""Sisters"" which is just fine and they pay tribute to the 1940s war classic, ""Bugle Boy.""I really don't have any problem with their music standard but I would like to see them sing more contemporary songs in their own style like ""I Will Survive"" and ""Heart Of Glass."" They are nice trio of female singers who harmonize and vocalize well for the listeners out there to enjoy music."
5,fun,Betcha'll have fun with this CD. Loved the old songs and loved the way the newer songs were arranged.
5,Loved it!,"I really enjoy listening to the Puppini Sisters. At times they sound almost like the Andrew Sisters, as in Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, but in Heart of Glass they have their own unique sound. I discovered them by accident on Amazon, and I'm glad I did. I'm planning on buying some of their other albums."
2,Second Choice,"This CD was offered as an ""You may also like.."" item. Although it is a quality recording I was less than enthusiastic about the content."
3,Betcha Bottom Dollar...,"Four-part harmony really works better with the songs that were chosen. In my view, it just sounds like something (or someone) is...missing. Still, they garner 3-stars for the effort. Find a ""fourth"" ladies!!"
2,Very upbeat music,"I enjoy listening to the CD in the car, especially on long road trips as the music is fun and upbeat."
1,Cheap.,"I loved them at first..dainty and shiny..bought the black patent. Hard to find flats that are stylish. They ONLY LASTED 2 WEARS...and that was at a funeral and church..about 2-3 hours a time. CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!!!! The hole for the back strap stretched so big it's nearly ripped off and I was sitting nearly the entire time so how could this happen?! I thought Nine West had quality shoes but DON'T BUY these!"
2,Connectivity Issues With Macs,"Though they say they support Macs, I've had nothing but problems with this card. The installation went smoothly, but connectivity on OS 10.2.8 was inititially a problem. After many hours of different configurations, I got it to work. Then, I find that it was locking up periodically. My Mac works fine without the adapter plugged in. Who want periodic lock ups? Not me. I don't recommend this item if you own a Mac. Can't tell you about installing on PCs --havn't gotten that far yet--Oh yeah, the updated driver version on their web-site doesn't match the driver version it installs (tech support wasn't able to explain why). What's up D-Link??"
1,Serious problems remain for Mac OS X users,"I was hoping that this product would provide a solution to the problem of how to incorporate an older Mac G3 (Blue and White) into an AirPort network, but my experience with it resulted in more problems than it was worth. I downloaded the newest drivers from the web site and managed to get it up and running rather easily. But I soon found myself faced with serious problems involving an external firewire hard disk connected to the computer -- the drivers seem to have been corrupted to the point where it appears that only a complete erasing of the internal hard drive and reinstallation of the system is going to solve my problems. Obviously, this is more than I bargained on. Perhaps there is a way of getting this to work with Macs and some who have purchased it report good results. But, in my case, the costs have far outweighed the benefits. Let the buyer (or at least the Mac-user buyer) beware!"
1,Crashes my PowerBook,"Since I installed the DWL-122 driver on my PowerBook (running Jaguar), my computer (which never ever crashed before) became very unstable. The computer regularly freezed up completely (so I couldn't even force quit), often wouldn't start up and was generally impossible to use. As soon as I got rid of the driver (which was tough, since they don't include an easy uninstall) the computer started working fine. This product simply doesn't work with a Mac, and I feel deceived that they claimed that it would."
2,Disappointing performance on my Mac,"I bought this mostly because I could use it on my G3 laptop (running 10.2.6) or my PC desktop. However, after a couple days of using it I'm not at all impressed. It doesn't hold a connection on the laptop, makes my system unstable (freezes and kernel panics), doesn't work after the laptop wakes up from sleep, can't be unplugged (kernel panic)... I have to reboot my computer every half-hour or so because the connection just suddenly goes away.I downloaded the latest (beta) drivers from the D-link website, so an outdated driver isn't the problem."
2,Mac OS X problems,"After properly installing the drivers provided on the CD for my Mac I plugged in the wireless adapter and was promptly greeted with a ""You Must Restart Your Computer"" error message. No matter what I tried the device could not be recognized by my iMac with OS 10.2.6. I have found other people have the same problem, and it is specific to certain macs. Do research to be sure you will be fine with this product."
1,What a hunk of junk!,"I installed the drivers from CD. I re-started computer as directed. Computer will not boot! I call tech support, and I wait a couple hours without anyone anwering. I search D-link support board and there is no information at all!!!"
5,Just plain cool and it works good too!,I guess you all know by now not to use on a MAC or Apple. Well I have a PC and this thing was cinch to install and it seems to work quite well for being a 11MB adapter. I have a 802.11G router that is backwards compatable and I can't tell much difference from the 54MB adapter on my notebook. If you want a solid connection in a super tiny package this is your ticket.
2,Good product bad support,"I own this DWL-122 since more than a year now. I bought this for $39 as it was on sale Fry's. Since then I am using it with one of my Sony Windows 98 laptop and is working great. However when I bought my new Toshiba laptop, I couldn't locate the CD ( I am not proud of it but happens with most of the people). So I tried downloading the driver over D-Link website and boy! I spent more than 2 hours but couldn't get to work. The website instructions are very confusing. I tried installing and uninstalling different drivers, none of them worked. So gave up and connecting it using Ethernet cable :(.If I have to buy new adapter just for the driver. I would rather not buy D-Link product itself."
1,If wishes were wings...,"Sadly this doesn't work. Or should I say it works sporadically if at all. What a great concept though. I hope D Link will improve this and make an alternative for Mac users who don't have Airport cards, especially in older machines that need the original Airport card which Mac stopped making. I tried three of these before I gave up."
1,Not really Mac compatible,"I was only able to maintain a connection using the DWL-122 for 2-3 minutes between kernel panics. Without WEP, connections lasted slightly longer. Some channels worked better than others. But the longest I was able to connect was 10 minutes before another kernel panic. D-Link should not be marketing this as Mac compatible. That is the primary reason I bought this particular device. I am returning this product ASAP."
1,Forget it,Claims Mac OS X compatibility - crashes the computer everytime under all flavors of 10.2.x. The driver must not have even been tested - false advertising! Stay away from this one mac uses.
2,Spotty performance with OS X computer,"I picked this device up when our apartment set up a wireless network. Installation on my computer was a pain (I had a iMac G3 running os 10.2.8), eventually I had to reinstall the whole OS. When I did get it working the computer could not go more than thirty minutes before freezing (something that had never happened before). Finally I was able to correct it by downloading the most recent drivers (which are NOT currently on the company website). Even then the connection was still only so-so.Out of frustration I picked up a Belkin F5D6050, and it worked like a charm. Now my connection is twice as fast and umpteen times more reliable. My advice is to skip the DWL-122 product and go straight to the Belkin (much cheaper too)."
3,"Excellent price, but some difficulty in installation","The D-Link DWL-122 is overall a so-so product. Price after rebates was $29, the cheapest product I could find. There was some difficulty in the installation (Windows XP Home), as the drivers needed updating. Took about an hour to get it all set up, Windows finally detected a network and it was up and running.The price is excellent, I don't think you can find anything as cheap as this right now. However, the speed of this adapter varies constantly. My signal reception is ""very good"", but the transfer speed sometimes can be as low as 1.0 Mbps.Recommended for those on a tight budget, but in the future I would go for something like the Netgear Wireless G USB adapter. 3 Stars for the inconsistent signal and difficulty in installation."
1,DO NOT USE WITH OS X!!!!!,"This product does not work at all with OS X. I thought that I would be an exception to all of the negative reviews found online, but I was wrong. This product causes OS X to FREEZE!!! Yes, FREEZE! This should NEVER happen. Do yourself a favor and pick up a Belkin F5D6050. They have OS X drivers on their website and you will find yourself surfing the net from any wireless point."
1,Do NOT buy this crap,"I have a powerbook with MacOSX 10.3, and it only crashes when I'm using this adaptor. I've gone weeks without a single crash, and as soon as I use this adaptor for more than 2 hours, I get a kernel panic. Their tech support is no help either. I needed to buy this because my Airport card can't see the DWL-900AP access point we have (we have an all D-link network... a big waste of money). Go linksys or netgear, but definitely NOT D-link."
1,"Looks sexy, but very bad wireless adapter for MacOSX","- high latency at boot time- failure to connect to wifi network at boot time- high rate of connection drops (every 2-5 min)- crash while going on suspend mode- sometimes the wifi config panel would crash the system- the first driver provided on the cd-rom with the device made the system crash at startupOverall, having to reboot every 5 minutes makes this device completely unusable. I have bought this device on the Internet since its not sold in my country and Wifi adapters for Mac are quite rare. When I called the D-LINK US support, the guys refused to support me because I was calling from outside of America ! And they pretend to be a global company !When I contacted them by email, the only answer they could provide me was to reinstall the latest drivers (which I was already running).DWL-122 = Buggy drivers + inefficient technical support"
1,STAY AWAY if you have a Mac!,"This product will not work for more than a minute or two with my PowerMac G4. The driver hard crashes the entire computer within a couple minutes from a clean re-boot. The behavior is 100% repeatable, unfortunately.I checked on the D-Link website and they do not have a newer driver update.I can't believe that a company would ship such a defective driver. This experience certainly does not endear me to D-Link."
2,unreliable and bad range...,"I work as a PC technician for my local cable company's internet service and install these adapters daily for their customers... as well as trouble shoot problems for them. First off, regarding Mac users, you might as well forget it. They're supposed to work with MacOS X (10.2) but never have... at best I've seen them work intermittenly (and usually you have to plug it into the computer after you've booted it). As for PC users, it's a mixed bag. The adapters themselves seem to get unreliable after about 30 feet... sometimes I get good signals with interference-causing objects in between and sometimes I get poor signals with no apparent objects that should be causing interference. So... for PC I would say try one if you get a good price for it... and for Mac's my advice would be to not use this adapter as you will definitely experience problems with it."
2,Freezes my Beige G3 with Mac OS X.2.8,I have to agree with everybody here. It works great when it works. But after about 10 minutes it hangs my Mac and if I wait more than that I get a nice message telling me to restart my Mac. I'm taking mine back to the store I bought it from.
5,Do you HATE the phone company? This thing can help you stick it to 'em.,"The last thing I needed my local phone company for was my TiVo. Although TiVo was the ONLY ONE WHO EVER USED THE PHONE, I still got outrageous bills. Anything over 15 miles is long distance? Are you kidding me, SBC?So I VOWED that this was it. No more. No more SBC. And I hung up the phone full of righteous indignation. Then reality set in -- I don't have an alternative. Life without TiVo nearly made me bawl like the spoiled American I am.So I did what I always do in this type of situation -- I asked Google what to do. Google and TiVo told me what to do. Be sure to check the TiVo site to get the right kind of adapter for your version of TiVo.Buy this. Plug it in. Shoot the bird in the general direction of the phone company.*Sigh*It's so nice to beat a utility for once."
1,Very Poor Mac Compatability,"Despite advertising claims to the contrary (i.e. ""Supports MacOS X 10.2 and Later""), this product DOES NOT support 10.3. The drivers cause 10.3 to crash (seemingly randomly) after about 10-15 minutes or so -> nothing else has been able to bring 10.3 down on my machine, but the DWL-122 manages to cause a good ol' OS 9 style complete freeze. I emailed the company asking about a timetable for new drivers, but they have not responded. The connection is also intermittent (despite being about 10 ft from the router) on an eMac running 10.2. Unfortunately, it seems like the best option is to save your pennies and buy an Airport card - a dispointing option for those of us who wanted a USB adapter we could use on multiple machines."
1,Don't trust the box when it says 10.2 and above,"The box claims this thing works for OS X 10.2 and above. When I installed it on my 10.3 box, I was unable to boot even into single user mode. I had to actually do a clean install to 10.2 to get it to work. Even then performance was terrible, and I encountered random crashes. Mac users know how tough it is to completely freeze OS X ... great work, D-Link.Their customer service was absolutely terrible. They had no solutions, and wouldn't cover my restocking fee if I had to take the thing back. They reasoned that they could state that they support ""10.2 and above"" or ""10.2 and later"" because they may some day have 10.3 drivers.Spend the extra $20 and get a wireless bridge or gamelink."
5,"Much, much better than the similar Stanley snips","I bought these at the same time I bought the Stanley MaxSteel 14-566 Long Cut Straight Aviation Snip. They look a lot alike, but these are much better, cut with noticeably less effort and cut when the Stanley's just want to mash and tear the steel. Well worth the $5 additional cost."
4,One of my favorites,"I think this book is great because Junie B Jones is a great character. She is really funny and makes a lot of mistakes. This book is mostly about Valentine's Day, or as Junie B Jones would say ""Valentime's Day."" Junie B Jones learns that sometimes when someone is mean to you, it might mean that they really like you but don't want other people to know. I really like the ending."
1,Wish there was a button for 0 Stars,"Would not recommend this book to my worst enemy. This is not a role model you want your child to have. Everything wrong with our country begins with attitudes that things like this are appropriate, do yourself and your children a favor and read a classic not this schlock!"
2,"Kids love it, but read with caution.","Behavior and language aside, what I didn't like about this book was this: ""Look at me, for goodness' sake! I am precious! And when you're precious, boys automatically bring you lots of valentines."" said by the girl who claims to be ""the cutest girl in Room Nine"". Ug, this message is awful! Even though the girl goes on to get the same number of valentines as everyone else, I don't think a young girl will take away the big picture message so much as the 'it's important to be pretty so boys like you' message. When I read it I changed the word boys to kids. The story was cute, and I will read more of these, but I feel like I have to proofread them first!"
4,from a 10 year old what is wrong with adults,"I am reading so many reviews that are bad and I dont understand. It's a children comedy book not a lesson story. She got bad attitude and grammar, but your child does not have a perfect attitude or the best grammar. If you don't want tour kid to read it oh well. There is not a thing wrong with this book."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book is intended for a first-grade reader. The grammar is atrocious and it contains a lot of slang. My granddaughter asked for these chapter books and I have purchased 12 so far. On a recent visit, I decided to read one of the books to her and again was astonished at the content. I will be looking for a new more appropriate set of chapter books for a first grade reader and won't be buying Junie B Jones books anymore."
1,Grammatical errors especially made for 7-year olds,"Today , we visited our 2nd-grader's classroom on ""Grandparent's Day"". We asked our 7-year old to read to us. He read from a book published by Scholastic, entitled ""Junie B. Jones and the Mushy, Gushy Valentine"". To our dismay, there were no less than five grammatical errors in the three pages he read to us (for example ""costed"" instead of ""cost"".) This is simply outrageous. How can an allegedly responsible publisher create blatantly erroneous reading material for 7 year-olds in the formative stages of their literary lives? You should fire your editors and offer a public apology to your customers for your shoddy workmanship."
2,Did anyone else notice???,"I am a teacher's aide and a senior in college. Today, one of my students wanted me to listen to her as she read this book. I found myself correcting her grammar. It turned out that she was reading the book correctly, but the book was written incorrectly. I was appalled at the lack of proper grammar and told her to read the book for pleasure, and not to try to learn anything from it. I have seen only positive reviews for Park's books, but I was disappointed (over 6 errors in two pages). I hope parents and other teachers are paying close enough attention to what their children are reading...It would be a shame to continue letting children learn incorrectly. Even if Ms. Park was trying to write in the form of uneducated children, she is still perpetuating their ignorance of proper grammar. I wonder if society has gotten a little soft on the importance of good English in light of the rise of ebonics?"
1,Worst Grammar ever for a 5 yr old,"I have never met a five year that talked with grammar this bad, I just got this book for my daughter and was totally appalled and disgusted by the inappropriate language, bad grammar, bad spelling, and ridiciulous story. My child will never read another junie b jones book again. Her teacher has been reading this book to her class and I am completely upset that kids are enjoying these books, and even picking up the bad grammar, bad language, and bad behaviors shown here. If you want to write from a five year old perspective you need to be a little more realistic and why not actually listen to 5 year olds grammar, its a lot better than you imagine."
5,Junie B. is TERRIFIC!!,"My granddaughter, Emily, and I are reading the Mushy Gushy Valentine now. Junie B. is so funny and always seems to have a dilemma that she figures out for herself - and always doing the right thing in a comical way! We have laughed and laughed! The Junie B. Jones series is a wonderful way to introduce your budding little readers to chapter books. We can't wait to read the Toothless Wonder!Phyliss D. DixonFairbanks, Alaska"
5,Awesome,Junie BJones books are cool awesome and funny. This one is really funny and is cool. You should really buy it.
1,I'm Sorrry to Tell Ms. Milligan,"is the fact that Black men are married to Black women over 94% of the time and those who aren't are devoted to Black women only. She's being hoodwinked by mainstream media that shows Black men either with nonblack women or alone.Black romance is sorely lacking in mainstream media today. Black-owned media is taking up the slack by publishing novels, shows, etc., that show Blacks together in love. I guess she missed seeing it. Instead, she's blinded with her one-sidedness on IRs.I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone. But if you do read it, please read it with caution."
1,Pitiful Attitude Of Black Males Dominering White Women,Thought it was so sad! Women lowering their standards for a cheap peek at what white men do and dont have.VERY DEGRADING I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THESE GIRLS-REAL WOMEN WOULD KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. TIME DOES MAKE A WOMEN WISE.SHE CAN USUALLY SEE HER ERRORS AFTER ITS TOO LATE OR BY THE TIME SHE'S 30.I HAVE BEEN THERE.
1,Unfufilling Material,"If you are of another race and read this book, you would get the impression that black men are weak minded, misguided, confused, and unloving of himself and his female counterpart. As an African-American I will tell you this is not the case. As someone who is studying interracial relationships, I found this book mostly unfulfilling and misguiding. Alot of time was spent discussing negatives with very few if any positives. To the untrained mind, this book would develop and reinforce biases and give these people more ammunition to blame, demoralize, and criticize those who participate in these relationships."
5,"A Bold, Courageous Book","Kudos to you, Dr. Milligan, for having the courage to talk about one of America's most dirty little secrets, the black man vis-a-vis the white woman. Lynchings notwithstanding, we only have to look back a few years ago at the hysteria surrounding the O.J. trial, to know this is the final insult to Racists in America. This is one of America's oldest taboos, and you covered this subject quite well. This book has been a long time coming. Please continue to write about subjects which hit the truth! Congratulations on being on the Blackboard Bestseller's list! I think this is the second one I've seen you on, so you must have hit a nerve."
5,Plate,Pleased with plate and delivery. Helped complete this dinner service.The flowers in the plate are what originally attracted me to the pattern.Lovely.
5,Marksman Deluxe .177 cal. Air Pistol,"This may be the first time I ever bought an article from anyone that proved to be better than the specs. Yes, I changed the ""O"" ring and got rid of the ""burr"" but I also have an air pistol that is so good I can't believe it. Kudos to CheapHumidors for quality service and for shipping this to Canada. Well done and 6 stars to you all.RayNorth Vancouver, BC"
3,Decent quality wig for a great price,"I was looking for an inexpensive wig for my Bride of Frankenstein Halloween costume when I came across this one. The price was very reasonable so I ordered it. It was much better quality than one I had seen in one of our local party stores. Probably not the ""best"" wig like this out there, but I only needed to wear it for a couple of hours and it was just fine!!! I'd recommend it."
2,Lots of really good information - really badly structured,I think it is fair to say there is a lot of superb stuff in this book. But there is a scattergun approach to thematic development which means topics are clusters of loosely associated ideas lacking cohesion.Rubbish. Expensive rubbish.
2,Poorly written.,"The text is poorly written and rife with grammatical errors. It reads like the author(s) were producing a thesis and were being graded on word-count. They refer to their own research to justify their position. Other statements have no citations to refer to. I doubt if many organizations utilize even a forth of the practices the text suggest. What organization has the time and/or resources to expend on these ideas? I would rather read CIO magazine as it reads better and gets to the point.If I could, I would get my money back because it is definitely not worth $100+. At best, $20."
4,Youthful adventure,I read Jerrye's Intruders on Battleship Island. I think it is a great adventure for young boys. I would recommend this as a great read for young boys.
3,Not so much exciting episode,"This film is not so worth watching when compare with sister streetfighter, but the last scene can still impress the fans of Shiomi! But if U want to get the similar feeling of ""sister streetfighter"", it may not be the best choice!"
1,Waste of time,"I was realy courious about this book. So many 5 star reviews.But the book useless. No information on Kaizen.I thought I might have received wrong book, but no, I received the right one.The author never saw a Kaizen.I am ordering other books on topic. I advice you do the same.Silviu Szkipala"
5,Insightful Book,"I loved this book. It was insightful and well-written, but an easy read. It teaches you how to break down any goal into such simple steps that you cannot fail. Wonderful. It reminds me of FlyLady (www.flylady.net)."
3,"Old Ideas, New Package","The book is filled with good ideas packaged in a 21st Century manner, but offers little original thought. Still, it's worth the read and could make a difference in the truly motivated."
5,"Quick read, lots of business examples, clear instructions","Great book! Why?1. If you have the time, can be read in one sitting (I'd estimate 1-3 hrs, depending on how fast you read).2. Focuses on how kaizen works at the individual level. The majority of the examples are business-related, and a few examples are included that illustrate how to use kaizen to address personal goals such as addiction or weight loss.3. Clear, brief explanation of the role of the brain and why kaizen works with the brain.4. Good format - each chapter is summarized and includes key points as well as recommendations/instructions.Based on the amount of time required/cost of book, this is a great value. A practical choice for busy people; also serves as a good companion for longer business texts on continuous improvement."
3,Did not read it all,"The same idea repeated over and over with some examples.. Not very enjoyable to read, the idea is nice and it may work with some but necessary with all or with all situation.."
4,Thought provoking,"This book had some interesting concepts regarding tackling difficult decisions. By asking yourself positive questions, and making small steps at a time, you can reach your goals. It shows you that your mind is an amazing mechanism and if you improve your thinking, you can change your life."
5,"Large lifestyle change, Small book","Dr Maurer's book explains how you can motivate yourself and get your life into gear, simply by making tiny or almost insignifcant changes to the way you organise yourself. No change or effort is too small. The results are always cumulative and thus worthwhile.Certainly incredibly helpful."
4,Great Book,"Good concepts to follow. I've already begun to use some of these ways to move forward with tasks i've been putting off. Many of these I've experienced in the past, but it's been a good refresher. Want my adult children to read this and hopefully pick up some very worthwhile ways to conduct themselves in life. I recommend this book. Very easy to read."
5,:oD,Great book with a good & funny storyline. I really felt sorry for Harley & could feel her pain because of what she went through growing up. I could see how hard it would be for her to be able to really trust anyone & all the promises as well.Thank You
4,Cute!,A nice guy for a hero...what a concept! He had an ulterior motive but still. I really enjoyed this book and felt an empathy with both characters. The secondary characters were also very entertaining and interesting. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a feel-good romance.
4,Bought for use with C210 kit,Identical piece to the 2 included in C210 kit. Only reason for 4 stars is that I feel it's a bit overpriced considering the cost of an entire kit.
5,Excellent solution to baby-proof a room,"We bought a CordMate set to hide a cable in our living room, but we ended up having to buy several of these elbows in order to get the cable to make all the turns we wanted it to make. These elbows work very well with the CordMate system and are a great solution to hide an unseemly cable."
4,Good Value,"Nice Inverter at a good price. This inverter is fairly large, but it is also much more powerful than the ones that can only be plugged into the cigarette lighter."
2,"Works, but does not meet specification",Cuts out when DC voltage is still well above the cutoff voltage specified. So it becomes less useful than specified.
5,Great Product!,This is very nice product. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. It was ever better than the one it replaced.
3,Cobra CPI 450 Inverter Review,Works great! The fan is a little nosier than expected. Fan speed/noise increases as load increases.
1,Don't buy this model,"Don't buy this Cobra model. I had a Vector invertor 400 for 10 years, went bad order a Cobra 450 because of price $30.00 no shipping. Unit was defective, returned it $8 shipping, replaced it with like kind, defective, $8 return, letter from Amazon widespread problem with this model, could not replace it. Re-fund my money, ordered a Vector $38 plus $10 shipping. Got email no refund on 2nd Cobra replacement order placed 2 months without, could have bought a unit in town for $45 go figure."
5,her spirit moves you,"Within the pages of this beautiful little book, the reader finds magic, truth, beauty and healing.As an author,Chinese Medicine & Healthy Weight Management, and healer, I recommend this book highly to my patients and friends, as well as to you."
1,Highlighter heaven,"Unfortunately this second hand book had been much loved by its prior owner. Not only did this person save their place by turning over the corner (sometimes three in a row) but they also highlighted great swathes of writing, scribbled all over entire pages and wrote their name along the pages of the closed book. Not much chance of me ever forgetting its second hand. Very disappointing.Thankfully it's such an inspiring read its still worth it! For anyone who likes to explore other ways of living with a new way of thinking about yourself and the world, this is a wonderful accessible read complete with exercises and meditations to help process the information.'The Dance' might be my new favorite by Oriah Mountain Dreamer."
3,"Nice, but not discounted","It's a nice watch. It's a little big.Don't be fooled by seeing the watch for 80% off or something ridiculous like that. This brand markets itself as a high end brand, but a quick search shows that their watches all sell for similar prices and none are listed at *full* price.It's a nice watch, though. Stylish, but don't think that you have a high end timepiece."
1,Nice looking product - poorly made...,I received the watch a couple weeks ago. When I went to set the time the crown broke off so I did not get to enjoy it. The product is back with Amazon and I am waiting for my refund. It is too bad as the watch was attractive....
3,Not for me,"This was to be a gift, but when I opened the box I found the watch to have a huge clunky face. Sent it back."
1,12 step plan for cycling,"I was really disappointed with this. I was looking for a book that would explain the use of heart rate zones and help me use it to improve my cycling. This is a 12 step program to zen cycling! It is overly complex and involved way too much ""process."" Almost every paragraph introduces a new idiosynchratic piece of jargon - microcycles, mesocycles, and macrocycles - give me a break! This book outlines an entire plan without detailing the plan! You must make a goal and write it down. You must decide whether you want to use ""threshold"" heart rate or maximum heart rate. You must calculate your zones. You must then periodize your training and then personalize the periodization (or maybe you personalize first and then periodize). It is simply too evangelical to be of any use unless you buy into the zen program. For someone who has a specific goal, this book may help you achieve it. If you just want to be a better cyclist, this is a waste of time."
3,"Not bad, just not that good.","This book was a fairly interesting read, although I don't think it adds much that hasn't been said elsewhere. I've read a couple books about cycling and heart rate zone based training. This is a fairly simple and decent overview. It just seems a little light compared to the rest. Still, it covers all the basics. I recommend finding it at the local library. You can get through it in a couple of days."
1,Priceless? More like Pointless...,"this book should have ended half way through, but i thought to myself that maybe it will get better. It didn't. The last few chapters i just skimmed to see if they actually ended up together, because the main characters are completely unsuited for each other. Not to mention the fact that the male lead is shallow and the female lead spends the entire book trying to convince everybody that she is the 'ugly sister.' If she wasn't fishing for compliments i don't know what she was doing."
3,"Light, Airy Fun","Not bad, but not the best I've read from Ms. Dodd.I liked the upfront imperious chit that Bronwyn started out to be and thought her later meekness below her. Adam was rather arrogant throughout the whole. I was expecting more humor and interplay between him and Bronwyn. I wanted and expected her to tough it out with more wit and profound reasoning. She hardly put up a fight before she slept with him.It's fluffy intelectually and verbally but not a bad read.Chock up one more innocent intellectual to the fickle flames of desire."
2,too bad to read,"I just bought this thinking it would be another great C. Dodd book. Boy, was I mistaken. It was unreadable. I tried for a few chapters but it was so poorly written that I ended up giving it to charity. What a waste of $. Big disappointment."
1,Worthless!!!,"I can generally always finish a book, I am even still working my way through Tom Jones-but this one went into the donate pile at page 100. It wasn't even worth finishing. The characters were ragged, whiny and totally unbelievable-the story was thin and contrived-not a bargain"
5,Good Music,"If you are a Muay Thai practioner or are a promoter looking for music to play at your Muay Thai fights, this CD is great. Very traditional and authentic."
3,jet 708315lsb jbts 10ls 2 eable saw,extension tables on each side were not level with the main tablethis model had no way to make the extensions level with the maintable.
4,Great Saw - For What It Is,"I've owned this saw for nearly two years and done a variety of projects with it. For the money I don't think that you can buy a better saw.The criticisms of the fence and miter are valid, and you really need to invest in a quality blade for best results - however, for a portable small machine it works like a champ. The saw is a valuable addition to my shop."
2,Worst table saw I have used,"I purchased this saw since it was cheap and I didnt have much money to spend at the time, now I have the buyers remorse, I should have just waited until I could afford something better. I mainly used it for framing and rough work, so accuracy isnt so important, but this is not an accurate table saw. With a 10 inch blade you cannot rip a 2x4, you have to go so slow for it to chew through it that the blade burns the wood. So I removed the 10 inch blad and put on a 1 1/4 inch thin fast cut blade, which solved the power problem, but the blade barly raises high enough to make it trough, maybe this works if you are cutting 1 inch material and you dont care if your cut is straight, other than that, this isnt your saw"
2,"Some solid parts, but lots of problems","Adjusting the blade into parallel was nearly impossible. The blade is currently stuck on the arbor. I tried beating on it pretty hard to get it off. I know most people are probably saying ""what an idiot"" right now, and I agree, but when you are pressed for time and getting really annoyed, it is easy to get violent. I should have called Jet, but I never got around to it. This happened almost 6 months ago, so I am a little out of touch with exactly what is wrong.(I have been at college so I haven't been able to get to it)Some one mentioned putting a cement blow on the bottom for weight, I did that and when the saw was working it worked very well in keep the saw from shaking.If you are some on that doesn't mind screwing around with stuff, this saw might not be bad for you, as the actually construction seems to be pretty solid. Personally if I were to start over I would but a table saw from a local store and probably get a Bosch."
1,spend a little more....,"Pros: Doesn't take a up a lot of space. Good motor but not great.Cons: The fence sucks. The miter gauge sucks. You're better off buying a after market fence and miter gauge.Verdict: If I could go back in time, I would of spent more money for a higher end saw. I find myself going to my dad's house to use his table saw. I feel I wasted my money."
1,"Seriously, are you kidding me?","A little forward:I'm a wood worker. I'm not professional, but I do some real nice work as a serious hobby. When I moved cities, I sold my bigger saw and needed a quick replacement temporarily. I bought this saw with my fingers crossed.If you want a review from an experienced woodworker who makes some nice furniture as a hobby........then here we go.This machine is really pretty poor in regard to precision and accuracy. The runout on the blade is literally over 1/16"". That's really pretty bad. When I rip boards, I get burning and a frantic edge throughout the cut. I went to a TK Freud blade and got no improvement. The fence is weak and flimsy. The tabletop is small.So, you are asking...........""You paid $210 for this, what did you expect?"" Good call. I expected very little. But this thing is essentially unusable for what I need it for.If you're cutting some Ply for weekend makeshift projects, it's fine. For anything else, but something else!!!!!!"
5,Pleasant surprise,"Needed a backup saw during repair of my 12"" dewalt and happily read the positive reviews for the 10"" Jet benchtop saw. As usual, I then dedided to buy one from Amazon (I own the their stock!). It was a pleasant surprise to find such a great little saw at such a reasonable price. It is built well and runs quietly without vibration. Just what I needed."
1,Outdated and kind of depressing.,"This book may be helpful in research, but it would make any current cancer patient feel dismal wil less than positive prognosis after recovery due to learning disabilities from the medications. These were patients from decades ago, and I think the doses have changed. Also, the writer started this project with intention of writing about survivors with resulting LD , so I think her view was skewed."
2,Be careful with this ripoff,The Bluetooth adapter dosen't work until you ungrade it over the web. Then they ask for 39.99 to activate the upgrade. So the deal is not bad if you want to pay for it twice! Very agraviting
4,Shipping cost almost as much as item,"The item was fine, but the shipping cost was exorbitant.The packaging was just a mailer envelope, nothing fancy."
3,Great but messy.,"The birds love it. but because it has so many non-shelled sunflower seeds, it creates a mess."
1,Timeless Principles,"The review below and the nasty one-star review placed on Marcia Stigum's book recommending Mr. Choudrhy's work at the expense of Ms. Stigum's seem to suggest that she wrote the review favorably comparing her book to Mr. Choudrhy's book. Since she recently passed away, that is hardly possible, even though her book outsells this one even after her death.It seems more appropriate to recognize that the principles of the money markets and repo and the mathematics of these markets are universal and timeless as is Marcia Stigum's work."
1,Identity Crisis,"It is interesting that most, if not all, of the 5-star reviews below appear to be written by the author's? aliases. For instance, the Oct. 7, Oct, 20, both Oct 22 reviews, and the Nov. 4 review all currently originate from X Moore from ""John Rasheed"", although in the past they've all shown London or Cape Town origin as ""John Rasheed"" sought to cover his tracks.""Mr. Gagan Singh"" writes several negative reviews of other books, but positive reviews of Mr. Choudhry's books. ""Mr. Gagan Singh"" wrote negative reviews of Ms. Stigum's ""The Money Market"" and alternately hails from NY, the USA, Capetown or from wherever next this chameleon chooses to hail as the reviews change.""Matthew Bartlett"" is another alias used on two book reviews of Fabozzi's ""Collateralized Debt Obligations"" book. One of the ""Matthew Bartlett"" reviews is signed ""Moorad Choudhry"" and praises the book with 5-stars, but the other review is unsigned and gives the book a one-star review. This is a serious identity crisis."
4,Worth Owning,"This is a well written book covering not just 'repo' but also introducing TRS and ALM (total return swaps and asset liability management). It does a good job of showing how the repo desk interacts with other trading/sales functions. For those of you in the industry , the examples are all 'bloomy' screenshots."
3,Beautiful Mug-Bad design,"I purchased 4 ""Duckhouse"" Auburn mugs this summer. Two of the 4 mugs have cracked around the handle area and had to bediscarded. I did not put them in the dishwasher or microwave.The positive side is that they freeze up nicely and look great. I am disapointed."
2,la la la kaydee p2/r2,"Arthur and the Minimoys is an exciting and interesting science fiction book with a bit of a romantic twist. Arthur is a curious ten year old boy whose grandmother's house is about to be bought by the evil storeowner, Davido. That is unless they can pay off their debt. So, arthur sets out on a journey to find the minimoys, an african tribe who are about 1 inch tall. From the clues Arthur's grandfather left before he disapered- four years ago. I didn't really like this book, but if you like books with a vivid imagination, you will probably like it."
3,I wasn't wild about it,"hi well to start this book was okay. I liked the movie better but since there are two books I'll just cover them both in this one review. book #1 Arthur and the minimoys,It was slow at first then it got good and fun then slow then fun and so on and so on. then it ended bad they just got into the forbidden city. which made me kinda mad that you had to buy the second book to know how it ended. Book #2 Arthur and the forbidden cityThis one was better it was never slow and had more action and whithout even knowing it Arthur marrys Selenea! And well the excuses to get out of things were not very good. I liked both books okay well gotta go hope this was helpful Brooke"
5,Exploring Virtual Gettysburg Was Fun,"My fifth grader was learning about Gettysburg and this seemed like an excellent learning tool. WOW were we surprised. It was easy to navigate and it made you feel like you were really there. My younger children also enjoyed it, especially watching Lincoln give the Gettysburg address. My son brought it to school and the teacher said it was very helpful to the entire class.Virtual Gettysburg made history so interesting that now my son wants to be an historian. I would recommend this to anyone interested in this part of history. Parents, and teachers alike."
5,Beyond Virtual,"I am so amazed with this software. Every time I go back, there is something new to see. The details of the battlefield are phenomenal, more than I ever even wanted to know! The best part for me is the 3-D panoramas. I've never been to the actual battlefield, but with the all the 100 or so panoramas that I can interact with, looking in any direction, I feel like I've been there. Now, if they can only develop some 3-D ""virtual"" glasses for this product. . ."
5,Saved my data twice in 2 months already,"I have used PC's since 1985 and was skeptical that this would really work, but after the glowing review in PC Shopper I gave it a try.Just 2 days ago my Outlook 2000 had an error and would not allow Windows 2000 to start after a re-boot. It took about 15 minutes to find the right saved image but GoBack put my machine back 100% the way it was before Outlook blew up.Two months ago the same Windows 2000 machine hung during the boot. GoBack got it going again with no data loss.This is probably the best program I have ever purchased since it has saved me a ton of time. You won't be disappointed with it. Until Windows is really 100% solid, GoBack is a must on your machine."
3,Booting problems,"My computer has never worked correctly since I installed GO BACK. It will not boot, most of the time, unless a cd is in the drive. It can be any cd, not necessarily GO BACK 3.0. If GO BACK is disabled, it boots normally.Roxio technicians have been actively attempting to solve the problem, and efforts are still underway when I send them more system information.The product works fine except for the problem introduced in the boot process so far as I can tell."
1,DONT BUY GO BACK,"I am a computer tech. and i have had many problems w/ computers that have go back installed. It is not worth the money, because of the problems I have seen it cause."
1,Lots of problems with XP,"Slows down computer a bit and will not let computer shut down. You get to the 'windows is shutting down"" screen and that's it. Hard restarts are not good and I had to do about 10 of them until I removed Go Back 3. Computer is faster and get this...It actually shuts down. Don't use this product unless you are a moron. Windows has a system restore on it. If you screw something up...Use that."
4,What you find out AFTER you open the box!,Go Back is great time machine. I got hit with a virus AND a Trojan Horse at the same time. I simply went back in time to asafe point and started anew.But....I later needed to re-partition my hard drive. In orderto do so the Go Back program had to be disabled along with myAnti-virus program (according to the read-me file). The viruscame back from Quarantine immediately and really blew my systembecause I had NO Protection at that point.It is a great program but with a limitation that can hurt. Ionly wish this kind of info was on the OUTSIDE of the box! Whichnon-co-existing program was wrong? You tell me.
4,It works !!,"A family member of mine can honk up his computer system in no time at all - missing drivers, won't recognize h/w, can't find s/w, etc. Always a big mess and he won't offer hints on what he tweaked. This is the best christmas present I ever bought him (and myself). Its been installed 2 weeks and he's already had cause to run it 3 times to fix the setup. No more gritchy calls to my house to come fix it! It's worked every time so far...what a bargain at this price."
1,I used to love GoBack,"When I had Windows 98, it was great. When I upgraded with a new computer and Windows XP, I couldn't use my old stand-by (incompatible), so got the the version that was compatible with XP. After installation, I couldn't shutdown or restart the computer. When I un-installed the program, my computer worked just fine. I'll try it again later, after downloading more XP updates."
2,"Good, But Variably Compatible w/Windows","I've been a long-time advocate of GoBack, and have successfully used a version of it (GoBack 3.0 Personal Edition) on 2-3 of our home computers, off of a Norton Systemworks disk that contained the program - with two of those three computers running Windows XP Professional. I read about the features of the GoBack 3.0 Deluxe, so I bought this program, but every attempt to install (clean or upgrade), has resulted in the install being rejected - due to incompatibility problems with my version of Windows. Really? A reinstallation of GoBack 3.0 Personal Edition, never has any problems, but apparently it's a ""bridge too far"" for the Deluxe version. A little frustrating, but the program didn't cost a bundle, and I've likely got friends at work who would be willing to engage in a transaction to give this program a good home. So, you can't go wrong with GoBack - but be sure to investigate compatibility issues before you buy."
2,GREEK OWL COIN PENDANT,"I was unhappy with the quality of the Greek Drachma coin that I ordered. The coin is somewhat scratched to begin with, and basically looks rather cheap. I would not recommend the purchase of this type of pendant, and suggest you save your money."
4,Good Mascara,"It's not a bad mascara at all. My only complaint is that it's a bit thick, and it sometimes clumps up a little."
5,Best Punch There Is,"You need to look no further for the best ceiling punch. Made in the USA, and punches a perfect, clean 1/8"" hole every time and has NEVER failed on me. Like the other reviewer said, sometimes it can be a slight bit difficult to angle into position, but not really. This matched up with the Malco riveter is an awesome combo."
3,It's cute,"I've started reading Arthur's books to my sons and they love the colorful pictures in the book. The storyline is cute ~~ nothing spectular or exciting. Arthur invites everyone to his birthday party only to find out one of his friends, Muffy, has her birthday party the same day. Arthur decided to surprise Muffy by hosting the party at his house and all ends well.It's a cute story though I am not quite sure about ""Spin the Bottle"" gift at the end. That may be a little too old for 8 year olds. But it's not offensive or anything ~~ it's just a cute story about birthday parties.1-12-04"
1,Sexist content,"I was very disappointed to find sexist content in this book. When the children discover that the boys and girls in their class might end up at separate birthday celebrations, a boy asks ""Who needs girls?"" The girl character's reaction, on the other hand, is ""But it won't be as much fun without the boys."" The message is that boys are more important than girls. Disturbing!!"
1,Inappropriate Message for Children!,"I picked up this book at a garage sale--I wish I would have checked it out more closely. I'm not about to explain the ""spin the bottle"" game to my young daughter. The Dad or Uncle in the story is wearing an apron that says ""Liberated Partner""--very strange. It's not worth the 50 cents I paid. That'll be the last Arthur book I ever buy! It's going right in the trash!"
1,Spin-the-Bottle for 4-year-olds?,"The story itself is fairly benign, but when you have to start explaining the what, why, and wherefore of spin-the-bottle to your 4-year-old, things get a little sticky. Why would the author and publisher want to insert such content--which would resonate more with the 12-14 year-old crowd--into a book for 4-8 year olds? Also, it reduces a wonderful boy-girl friendship into the ""standard"" sexual attraction relationship. There's enough of that on TV geared toward young kids. Why not let them enjoy simple sincere friendships for another few blissful years?"
1,Missed Target Age Group,"I'm really glad my 6 year old got to read about ""Spin The Bottle"" in first grade today. Thank you, Marc Brown."
1,Not the best children's book. Buyers beware!,"I don't mind the story about Arthur and Muffy. I am very surprised that a bottle label with ""spin the bottle"" was given to Arthur as a birthday gift. Out of all the things in the world, this is a gift given in a Children's book. Very odd and inappropriate. I wish I read the review in more details before I ordered the book."
4,Suprise Birthday,I really like the book Arthur's Birthday because I liked when Arthur figured out what to do when Muffy and his birthday are on the same day. He was kind and knew what he was doing.
3,Great For a Birthday Reading Lesson,I am a student teacher and think this book can be used as part of a K-2nd grade reading lesson. Children can relate to the topic and make predictions throughout the story. The colorful illustrations will keep children attentive. Arthur is having a birthday party and a conflict arises between him and Muffy. Arthur comes up with a great solution to the problem. The only part of the story that I thought was inappropriate for children was the gift that Francine bought for Arthur and wanted to play with right away at the end.
1,Don't work via remote.,The zune a/v pack was too good to be true at the price. The remote is not functioning and the ave cable is popping and hissing on stereo. Wait of time waiting for ups and waist of money. Would have been great if worked as described. The package was all mix match and a dead remote that is non functional. Tried new battery and still a no go. Sad sad sad world when sellers can sell refurbs as new or used as new for this item was not new. Came in a ziplock bag and all shoved in a zune case. The case is neat but would be great if remote actually did what its supposed to. Work!!!
3,Remote had some problems,"I got the zune and really looked forward for having this pack as well. I got it for 29.99 which i thought was a good price for it as it will allow me to charge and also play songs using my remote. I really dont care about the A/V cable.The pack arrived and i just set this up in a minute. The remote worked and life felt good. But then suddenly, the next day the remote stopped working. I tried the next day and so on for a week. But it did not. I then just kept it aside. I thought of returning the entire thing, but the shipping costs and also the fact that I will loose the wall charger stopped me. Eventually time also ran out.One day I just tried the remote again. And to my surprise it worked. It has been working since then and I am happy now. But I will not give it more than 3 stars because of the trouble it gave me initially.you should have visibility between the remote and the zune for it to work. It will not work if you keep the zune behind the tv or some object."
4,Essential for the Zune,The AV pack is essential for the zune. You get another sync cord which doubles as a charging cord to charge from the wall outlet.Don't buy the zune without this.
4,Zune Home A/V Pack Review,"I'm very happy with this product. Installation and setup are easy and the device plays flawlessly on a Bose Lifestyle system. The only reason I did not give it a 5 out of 5 is that the remote operation is not always intuitive (like which button to hit to go forward, back, pause, etc.). It's easy to figure out through trial and error, but it could be easier and the documentation is very minimal."
1,Misrepresented from DLN Enterprises,This product is pictured in a nice package. I ordered this as a nice gift. What I reieved was a bunch of cables in a ziplock bag and a not telling me ho much money I saved by not getting the original packaging. The only one who saved money here was the seller not the buyer. The buyer purchased what was pictured. The seller shipped something else. I recieved this garbage bag from DLN Enterprises. two days before Christmas when I ordered it two weeks before Christmas. I love Amazone and buy several items a week. This is bad for Amazon to be dealing with dishonest merchants like DLN Enterprises. Extremely disapointed!!!!!!!
2,Zune home audio kit,I purchased the home audio kit for my ZUNE 120 and the dock is not compatible with it. So its basically useless.
2,Not compatible with 2nd generation 80 GB Zune,"This dock is not compatible with the newer 80 GB Zune models. The docking interface is backwards and the Zune does not attach properly to the unit.Unit itself is nicely built, solid feel, so it gets 2 stars for that."
2,"this is a great idea, however","this is an idea for the record books, after the fall of our civilization will be poems wrote about this invention. Excellent idea to use your zoom to play music for television or surround system. it's only downfall in only one that only works half the time in remote never works I've had to live these the remote does not work check the batteries checked the connections doesn't work. If I wonderfully works you should try to sell it on eBay, or donated to the museum is you truly have a one-of-a-kind thing."
3,Good for the price,"Bought this unit because of the price. I have recently bought a Zune HD and figured I would have some utility and I do. It does charge the Zune and allows input to older home stereo unit that I have in a detached garage - great music while I'm working! It does not transfer video to a monitor/TV. After thinking, this feature would really come in handy as I travel. I may get the newest version when (if?) it comes down a bit more.One other note - it does not come with a sleeve to make the HD fit exactly. You will have to be careful if you buy it for the same reason I did."
3,Needs better instructions.,This was not exactly what I thought it was. I am not happy with the lack of instructions.
3,Good accessory pack for the Zune,"I found this accessory pack very helpful with my Zune. It is great for charging the Zune (from a computer or power outlet) and for connecting the Zune to TVs.There are some negatives, however: First of all, it doesn't come with a carrying case, which is annoying considering the steep price and the number of components in the pack. Also, the remote control is VERY weak--I had trouble getting it to work from much more than five feet away (so don't plan on using the remote from across a room). Lastly, I think a mini-to-mini cord would've been very helpful. The connecting cord is great for hooking the Zune up to a TV using RCA jacks, but you cannot use this cord for hooking the Zune up to many speakers or audio systems."
3,Buyer Beware Zune 30 GB and Home A/V,Zune Home A/V PackAmazon did not make clear that the Home A/V pack was an older version. I also bought the 30GB Zune at the same time. This also was the 2006 version. The promotional code for a free trial of the Zune Marketplace (included with the Zune) was no longer valid. Amazon did not respond to my request for a valid code. A former Amazon customer.
3,Home A/V pack,Works as intended. Was brand new in a selaed box. Shipping time was very prompt. would recommend to anyone who is in the arket for this product.
4,Great product form MS Zune,I love this unit. The remote only works when directly pointed at the base but it is great to be able to browse your collection and watch videos through a TV while using a remote. Great product and this does work with the 80gb Zune. In the instruction manual my unit came with there was instructions for how to properly outfit it for 80 gb.
4,Zune Home A/V Pack,Works great except for remote....unfortunately not all functions on remote work. Amazon did discount for me.
3,"It was exactly what I wanted , but...","The product was as advertised. Unfortunately the remote...which was a big part of it's appeal does not work properly. It will only advance in one direction, so it makes it a pain to cycle through memus and lists."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This product was supposed to be a gift for xmas and it came packaged in a large plastic ziploc bag. No instructions, no box. Worse -- no receipt or packing information! The product works okay, but it would've been nice to know that we were receiving something that came in ""bulk packaging""."
1,Not Compatible with Zune 2,Not compatible with Zune 2. Should state somewhere on the ad that its only compatible with 1st gen Zunes. Will be returning for a refund.
1,listen to the one star people,"this stuff sucks! everything that has been said about the Ziploc bags, and the useless remote, and the fact that you can't get the video up on the LCD screen on the TV is 100% true.I just wish I had taken these people seriously!!! Buyer beware."
4,Zune Home A/V Pack,"Included additional cables, AC changer remote and dock. Individually these would have cost more which made it worthwhile. Dock was a VERY tight fit for my 80GB gen 2 Zune, though my older 30GB fit just fine. Remote is magnetic (nice buns) and only works in conjunction with the dock."
3,Zune Docking Station,"Circular Docking Station that can hold a small or large Zune. Has a Remote control that comes with it. Comes with the Red, White, Yellow AV cable out. Has Video cabability, but you have to change a setting on your Zune to do it. Comes with an additional USB cable that you would use to hook it up to your computer... but it is also plugged into an adapter that you plug into a wall and then powers the docking station. Have not tried it... but you should be able to hook almost anything that has a USB cable into this block and then plug it into a wall."
1,Very poor product,"The shipping was on time. Thats the only good thing I could say about this product. It was broken when it arrived. I tried to fix it with no luck. When I called and complained I was informed that I would receive a replacement which never came. It wasnt very expensive, so I didn't push the issue. I just use the cables once in awhile but thats it. When it's placed in the cradle, it doesn't work. Actually, the remote doesn't work either. :( Oh well..."
4,Zune Home Pak Review,Everything in this package serves it's purpose. I suggest this pak to anyone who already has a home stereo system. Instead of buying a separate boom box (like the $300 Bose system for Zune)take advantage of the speakers you already have. This is a stylish way to display and use your zune in your home. It's great for when guests are over your house. I also let it play on my home stereo (that's also linked to my dvd player and tv) turn down the volume on my tv and listen to music while I play a game on the PS2. The product itself is sturdy and stylish. The remote control is magnetic so you can toss it onto your fridge so it won't get lost.The audio/video cable is good quality. I bought a home surround sound stereo system w/built in DVD player Phillips $120. This home Pak for under $100. And I feel i've got the best of all worlds.
5,Very versatile!!!,"I bought this mainly for a docking station for the PC so that I wouldnt have yet another usb sync cable to sort through. It works perfectly for that, and just convinced myself to order 2 more. One is for the bedroom, so when I want to fall asleep with the headphones on, I can just setup a playlist and drop it into the docking station hooked up to my little dvd/stereo/etc combo unit in there, without having to burn a new cd and playlist. I could just take the zune to bed, but worried about it getting knocked about when I fall asleep with the headphones on and roll over. The other one is for my little woodshop. I can set it up so my little tv can view tv shows I dump on it from my htpc, and I dont have to worry about sawdust getting on the cd's and in the dvd player. Very handy little thing, and beats the heck out of paying 100 bux for it at Best buy or CC!"
3,Too pricey and difficult to find,"About 12 years ago I installed these floodlights to illuminate the columns in front of our house. They look really nice but it seems I have to replace them way too often. The only place I can find replacements are online and they are very pricey. I would like to find the lens covers that go with these and maybe they would last longer. Overall, this is a good product!"
4,Incurably Romantic,I love this collection. It allowed me to purchase two movies I thoroughly enjoy (The Lake House/Youve Got Mail) and familiarized me with one I had not seen (The Phantom of the Opera). All three at at an afforable price. This is a great way to add to your DVD collection.
3,Step Boards do NOT come with required mounting brackets? Extra for about another $100!,"I was deeply disappointed that after going through a series of steps to insurethat the Westin Step Boards would fit my 2010 Chevy Silverado...Amazon.com states that the chosen Step Boards ""fit the 2010 Chevy Silverado withExtended CaB!I found out after taking receipt of the Step Boards...that the required mounting brackets are NOT included with the order...they have to be ordered separately!I believe that stating that the boards will fit my vehicle...but only when additional items have to be ordered (but nothing stated about that in the Amazon.Comstatements) is unethical advertising!"
5,Step board for my 2011 Toyota Tundra DC,"I bought this step board because its wide and you could step anywhere you like. You have to buy the specific mounting kit for your vehicle separately and the best way is to go the Westin website and for my 2011 Toyota Tundra it is the Westin 27-1725 Running Board Mounting Kit. Amazons website says it won't fit my vehicle but I called Westin to be 100% sure and they verify that it fits my truck.The installation doesn't need any drilling so it's really easy to install and I use a torque wrench to tighten everything in place. Because of my excitement, I didn't check the step board for dents before I install it and only to discover that it has two dents, one in each side (ouchh!). The good thing is it is not visible and I really don't want the hassle in exchanging it. The bottom line is it looks great on my truck and I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Very Helpful,This study guide is very helpful and has way of reviewing material other than just questions.
2,Guide for study of Farmacology,It was not what I was looking for.I needed a text book which I have now.
2,chipping paint,"i got these yesterday and all ready chipping when you screw it in the paint starts to peel of all ready and the sticker is only like a half a inch, unexpected (also the package is different)."
1,Unprofessional,"These bolts are Ugly and Weak.They look like they've been salvaged from someone's old Apple II; the head is covered in an ugly beige paint, which is chipping off.The bolts seem so old, and weak. I even managed to strip it a little bit, barehandedly, when I first installed them.Not only that, but the bolts fell off after the first use! I lost them on the road, and I refuse to look for them.Save your money and your time, and go to Homedepot, and pick up nuts and bolts there."
2,hardware,Two of the screws were defective. The tops were not scored to fit a screwdriver so we couldn't use them. We had to buy 2 more screws at a local store to mount the trucks.
1,I got screwed,Shy 2 bolts. How hard is it to count to 8? Riding the new deck will have to wait another day.
1,Shipping more than product,The shipping for this product cost more than the product itself. It was packaged in a medium sized box and would have fit easily into a small padded envelope.
4,"Very satisfied. Good brand, good performance, good price.","Was looking for a small, inexpensive scanner to scan paper text documents and convert them to editable files. This does the job perfectly. No muss, no fuss. I did find the user interface a bit oblique at first, but was able to figure things out with a minimum of frustration. Please note: I have NOT used it for color or high-resolution scans, so I can't say how it performs in that regard."
2,Anti- Booker T Wasgubgtib,The author has a strong hatred and biases toward Booker T Washington.. alot of commentary(biased) and no Independence researchof Booker Washington's industrial training.
5,Intrigue and Disappointment,"Lawrence Otis Graham's ""The Senator and the Socialite"" is an important work. Graham does a wonderful job of detailing the great accomplishments of Black-Americans - much of which you would not ordinarily hear about and should be proud of. However, I am saddened to learn the descendants of such an important historical figure (Senator Blanche K. Bruce) are ashamed of their Black-American heritage and now live as white people."
3,"Interesting topic, so-so execution","_The Senator &c._ is the family history of Blanche Kelso Bruce, the first African-American to serve in the United States Senate, during Reconstruction. It's a fine story, and I'm glad to be learning what I am about the Reconstruction years and politics, opportunities and swindles. But the author doesn't exactly excite me. His research seems relatively sound, but his writing is not going to get him any prizes or true fans."
4,It all started when I twisted the lid off the Olde E..,"Ok the main reason I am writing this review (one of the reasons I usually do) is because I see other people who are total morons writing long stupid reviews. Namely the one by ""E"" (I think it's right under me) giving this CD 2 stars and runnin his mouth with a bunch of crap. I clicked on all his reviews and guess what? this cat is also reviewing books about calculus, trigonometry, and stuff like that. SO THAT TELLS YOU HOW WRONG some of these rap critics are. I have been a Lynch/Sactown rap fan for years now and this CD is one of Lynch's best, right up there with Loaded/Season of the siccness. Top 3 of Lynch cd's, definitely worth pickin it up and bumpin it, don't believe the haters this one is dope."
2,lynch shoulda hung this cd,"Lynch does good on a few tracks, but to many bad guest (including a lazy performace by snoop dogg) on to many badly produced songs just takes any punch brutha lynch brings"
2,Nothing Special,"I just bought this album and tried to find a good song, but I just couldn't find one. This album is worth NOT Buying!"
5,Lynch Got Robbed,"This cd is slumpin, for a while........Lynch only got to do half the album himself because of problems that arose with Black Market Records. The new stuff that Lynch did is his usual rip-gutt cannibal style. The only real problem I have is that there are too many guests and not enough straight Lynch, its almost like BMR wanted to just promote there artists since they lost there only true star Brotha Lynch Hung to his own label,Siccmade Muzicc. So I gave it 5 stars because as far as the real Lynch tracks go, there sicc. Bye this one and look for Lynch's real new album on the Siccmade label next year."
5,top dogz,Brotha Lynch gets down on this one and i have to tell the people out there that this cd is more then it looks like i suggest u go check it out.it will draw u in and eat u from the inside out. its real stuff and hez real ill tell u that u want a good rap cd here it is...
3,"Good stuff, cheap cap",I used this sealer on my boat and it worked well. Unfortunately the cap is cheap and cracked ruining the rest of the tube.
4,Nice Watch...,This is really a very sharp looking watch and i get comments on it every time i wear it. Seems to be a high quality product. Packaging is very nice..comes with a nice storage box and documentation. Online registering of the watch was fast and easy. Very pleased with my purchase of this product.
4,Retirement Gift,"The watch is very nice. A bit heavy though, wasn't expecting that much weight. This was a retirement gift and was very well received."
1,Just awful,"1. Olympus doesn't provide drivers online. Why not? It's not like they have any value if you haven't purchased the player already.2. The VN series is evidently not compatible with Windows Vista. It won't let me reinstall the drivers.3. The forced file hierarchy (A, B, C groups) is dumb and causes problems. Why can't I just plug it in and drag/drop your files in Windows Explorer?4. When you speak, S's pop even when you're a couple of feet away.I wish I had purchased another brand."
2,"Voice recorder fine, but PC drivers don't work","If you can get the driver for this to install on Windows XP Pro, you're a better man than I. The CD software seems to install OK but then when you connect the recorder to the PC with the USB cable, the PC wants to install a driver manually. If you tell Windows not to install the driver (since, I thought, it was already installed off the CD), Windows doesn't recognize the recorder and the Digital Wave player software doesn't see any of the files on the recorder. On the other hand, if you do tell Windows to install the driver and manually point it to the VNUSB.INF file on the CD, it comes back with an error message and the Digital Wave player software still doesn't see the recorder. This is what it did on my PC at work; on my PC at home, results were even worse--it froze that PC so I couldn't even shut it down normally, but had to hit the reset button. It's been several years since I've seen a driver this kludgey."
1,I bought it for the PC connectivity and Olympus won't support it,"If you go to Olympus' website, you'd expect to find the driver for this DVR, but no...not Olympuss. Spend your money on a product that is supported...always. It's easy to google and see if they support their stuff. If support is the most difficult thing about them, there is a reason."
2,Good recording but terrible software ruins it,"The recording quality and functionality is all standard and as you would expect.However, the device does not integrate with the file system when uploading to your PC and you are forced to use the terrible Waveplayer. You can't copy files to new locations or save them in multiple places for security. For this reason, I'd avoid this product as there are much better interfaces out there."
1,"Nice Outside, Ugly Inside -ZERO Star if there is one","I document meetings at work so we got an Olympus VN-480-PC Digital Voice Recorder at work. It did not last one day before I got an ""ERR"" message. It never worked again. We returned it and will never get one ever."
5,Remanufactured VN-480,"This product was not adequately described in the product information. It was not compatible with voice-recognition programs, and it should have said so up front. It has good voice reproduction, but just wasn't exactly what I was looking for."
4,Great for Ford fans,"A good book to read if you like to read the history on Ford pickups from the early days on up to the present day,...my only gripe with it was there were not enough engine photos to show early engines to later,more modern engines in Ford trucks!"
2,"small, Chinese","Despite the description, these have an interior diameter of 2-11/16"" (68 mm) and an exterior diameter of 3-3/4"" (96 mm). Also, they're made in China and of unknown composition, so they may or may not be suitable for canning."
5,A must for your Line 6 Spider III,"This pedal is nothing fancy but essential if you don't enjoy stopping in the middle of the song to switch tone...It's very well built, compact and powers itself via the included (very long) cable. If you have a Spider III 75, this pedal will allow you to switch between channels A-D. The Spider III 75's 4 channels can each hold 9 presets (A1-A9/B1-B9 etc...). This pedal allows you navigate through the presets by going from A1 to B1 to C1 to D1. Manually move A1 to A2 on your amp, and your pedal is ready to navigate between A2 and D2 etc... Also, this pedal is very responsive and has no delay when switching between channels."
4,A solid foot pedal,"I purchased this for myLine 6 Spider IV 15 15-watt 1x8 Modeling Guitar Amplifier. It's a solid steel pedal of very high quality construction. The cable is a simple cat 5 Ethernet cable, so should be easily replaceable. I feel it's a bit over priced compared to other manufacturers' pedals, but it's solid, gets the job done and will probably outlast the amp itself."
4,Meets its purpose,Good quality and performance. It is good for house practice but not good enough for live gigs.
4,My favorite book of all time!,"Blue Moose is an excellent short book for kids to learn on. I first read it at the age of 12, when I was reading quite well, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I haven't met any other Blue Moose fans other than my friends and myself, and that disappoints me.This book should definitely be reprinted. I am not a tame moose!!!"
1,Arrived broken. Don't purchase from J&R,"This stereo was broken right out of the box. CD tracks would play for 30 seconds, then stop inexplicably, and an ""Err"" message would be displayed. (Error) This problem was not covered in the troubleshooting section of the manual. I tried many different CDs, including a brand new one that had never been played. No luck. Too bad, because the sound quality was good and aesthetically, the stereo looked great.I do NOT recommend purchasing from J&R;, either directly or through Amazon. I immediately called J&R; customer service about the busted stereo, and they told me to call TEAC customer service to try to fix the problem! (which, I found out later, was a long distance phone call) Some nerve. The correct customer service response would have been to apologize and offer to refund my money in full, but instead, I was given the run-around, then told that my original shipping cost would not be refunded. HUH?? Do not buy from J&R;."
2,Good but not HUNK,Lead guitarist songwriter of the almost band of the decade HUNK heads up this band. Just not the same.
1,stay away from this turkey,"I bought three of these RAID controllers, and two of them were bad- one right out of the box and another broke after one year. Here's a tip: you don't have to build your own RAID anymore. You can buy prebuilt RAID boxes with eSATA interfaces, for very reasonable prices. Maybe not at amazon, but elsewhere."
3,Battery,"Worked OK, stopped holding a charge after about 2 months. I would not buy this brand again as I expected better quality."
4,I use with a Pentax K20d,"Fits too snug in the k20d camera, but perfect for the Pentax k20d battery pack."
1,Does not fit the K20D,"This item does not properly fit the Pentax K20D. It goes in the battery slot just fine and powers up the camera. However, when trying to eject the battery, it gets stuck. I have not had similar problems with the original Pentax D-LI50 battery or Impact's NP-400 type battery.I will not bother trying this in my Pentax K10D... I'll be returning all 3 batteries."
2,Not as advertised,"Ordered the 1500mAh Li-Ion battery as advertised. However, when I received the item it was a 1300 mAh Li-Ion unit. 1300 not bad for the price but just was not what was advertised. Have not had it in the field so cannot say how long it will hold a charge. Hopefully it will hold well as am headed to Europe for a month and lots of pictures."
2,Subpar replacement,"I purchased this battery to use with my Pentax K10D. As another reviewer mentioned, mine also became lodged in the camera body and it was difficult to remove. It did work okay in the battery grip and held a decent charge (not as good as the Pentax battery that came with the camera, but not bad for the price). However, about two years after I purchased the battery, it suddenly refused to take a charge. I cleaned the battery contacts with an eraser and with a machinist's stone, but this did not help.Pay the extra money and get a reliable battery."
3,Great to start with,"This is a great carving block to practice with for the price. I just prefer a stiffer carving medium for precision. If your design doesn't require a lot of precision or your hands can't handle the stiffer premounted linoleum blocks, this is a decent carving medium to consider."
1,WRONG ARBOR SIZE,"The CSM736SC has a 20mm arbor hole. Until Amazon changes the description, you will get the wrong arbor size if you were expecting 5/8. The MK Morse CSM72540SC IS A 40 tooth blade with a 5/8 arbor.I purchased a Freud BL71MGW9 bushing to adapt the 20mm arbor hole to 5/8""."
3,"Not too bad, but could be better...","Here's the real track listing for Volume 3:Eric B & Rakim - Microphone Fiend 5:24Tribe Calle Quest - Bonita Applebaum 3:38Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince - Parents Don't Understand 5:12Tone Loc - Funky Cold Medina 4:09EPMD - Gold Digger - 5:02NWA - F**K The Police 5:4545 King - the 900 Number 3:03AMG - Bitch Betta Have My Money 3:17Latee - This Cut's Got Flavor 4:13Big Daddy Kane - Ain't No Half-Steppin' 5:21Digital Underground - Humpty Dance 6:28Joeski Love - Pee Wee's Dance 4:39Just to let you know, as in the previous reviews, the NWA track and the AMG track are edited, with every curse word, except ""Bitch"", being reversed. The gem is Pee Wee's Dance, which I've had a hard time finding on cd."
4,A World Tour,"My son enjoyed this book a great deal when he was in Kindergarden and First Grade. It managed to teach and link at least three distinct subject areas; science, geography and culture.There are definately more female than male children presented in the narative and drawings, but my very pragmatic little boy told me ""that is just a phase our civilization is going through and not to worry about it.""This book also has a practical benefit that makes it good evening reading; both your blood pressure and your child's blood pressure will likely return to normal levels because of the way the book is structured to end with the child going to sleep. I think this is one of the best bedtime ""reads"" out there for young children."
4,Works as expected,"I do not use a remote that often and want a cheaper than Nikon unit. It works great for that. If you use one alot go with Nikon. However, most of us use this a few times a year and this one fits that bill. The plug in is a little tight."
1,Cheap garbage and guaranteed to break.,This thing will maybe last you for 20 exposures before it breaks. Just don't bother. Go buy the inexpensive Nikon one and you'll be far better off even though it costs quite a bit more.
5,Just what I needed.,"This item works great for the price. Yes, it is simple but an original Nikon version cost much more."
1,"Started out well, crapped out","I got sucked in by the price, bought two, and gave one to my wife for her camera. Mine stopped working after about 40 shots on my D700 on the first time out. She doesn't use hers, and I don't think I want to rely on it. I'm going to get the Nikon product. Should have known."
4,Great for tight spots...,"But screws hold better. I found it worth the money, as I could not get into a tight spot and this went in easily. Also, for those marginal areas, you can use it for a starter hole for a screw"
3,"Works, but too bulky for tight spots","I purchased this crimper to secure the backside of perimeter walls in a basement remodel. I had several areas that were very tight to the foundation wall and/or some immoveable plumbing. Unfortunately the crimper is quite large and difficult to work with in the tighter areas.For the areas that I can get it into position, it punches a nice secure crimp.I do prefer screws to crimping though, and would not recommend this as a primary method to secure studes to track."
3,Mick Farren & The Deviants - 'Partial Recall' (Drop Out) 3 1/2 stars,"Eleven track compilation of various tunes by Mick Farren and / or the Deviants. Includes some material from the Deviant's '3' and 'Fragments Of Broken Probes' (see my review of both). Several of these tunes were originally released on this compilation, but have been put out on OTHER compilations that have been released at a later time. Couple of tracks that I thought were good include the fifteen-minute Farren epic ""Carnivorous Circus"" (possibly the best song of the entire CD) and their decently done Frank Zappa cover ""Trouble Coming Everyday"". Worthy UK psych."
3,This item is the VOCAL SELECTIONS from Nuncrackers - not the script.,"It should be noted that this item is NOT the script or libretto for ""Nuncrackers"". Even though it never says so in the information above, this is the VOCAL SELECTIONS from the show. I think that that should have been made clear in the title line!"
3,Review for DeMarini Glove,"awesome glove. best way to break it in, take a softball with two shoe strings and tie one around the top and one around the bottom and wrap the pinky inside. leave it like this for about a week and you will have the best feeling, best FIELDING glove on your team!"
1,very disappointed.,"I should have listened to the negative reviews on this product. Most Rubbermaid products are outstanding -- airtight and functional. I used this one for the first time this morning for birthday cupcakes and found, to my dismay, that the lid is loose on both sides. This will not keep baked goods fresh for any length of time, and that is what I purchased it for. This particular model is defective."
