2,Homecoming Reflection,"""Homecoming"" by Cynthia Voigt is a heartwarming story describing a family's perilous journey to seek out relatives. Personally, I did not enjoy this book very much. The book is separated into two parts. Part One was pretty interesting, but by the time I reached Part Two I found it quite repetitive. All the same events were occurring and and it became very boring. So much so that our class could not even finish the book. I believe that the author could have added some surprises along the adventure. I would not recommend this book to many people, but if you enjoy long adventure books, then go ahead and read it."
3,Homecoming,"Homecoming by Cynthia Voigt is about a family that has love, hope, and they deal with tough decisions and their long journey. I thought that the book was very good but after the first chapter in part two i felt as if the chapters were repeating themselves. I thought that the very ending of the book was good. I liked how Grandma TIllerman had a good change of heart and the kids had a stable home after she changed her mind.I would recommend this book to middle age kids and to those who enjoy adventure stories.I enjoyed the book and i would read the book again along with the other books by Cynthia Voigt."
5,Excellent Book,Hi! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good adventure. I read this book several years ago and it was simply impossible to put down. Every part of it captures the imagination as you journey along with Dicey and her family. This book was so good that I even bought the sequel to it and I really enjoyed that book as well. Homecoming is truly exquisite and will remain one of my most treasured books throughout my lifetime.
1,Boring as watching golf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"1st things first the book was horrible. I never knew a book about 4 whiny kids who got left in a cara in a mall's parkinglot and their mother was in an in an institution would be so pleaseing to readers. I was forced to read it by my idiotic teacher. Their mother runs off and she winds up in an institution in Boston. So they go to their cousin who is becoming a nun and has no life. Their grandma is a syco nut case and thinks about what it would be like to eat kids and babies. So if u read this think about it, it is a waste of time."
2,boring,"i thought that this book was very draggy, and really boring at most times... i mean i give the children credit for living their life on their own, trying to get to their relative's house on very little money from a babysitting job, but i just thought that it was really boring and didnt interest me at all"
2,I thought it was okay but i'd never read it again.,9 of 10 times you'd expect a book with a crazy mom and 4 little kids on their own would be the greatest book ever but it was only a 4 out of 10. Maybe it was the style or the fact the book was only original untill half the book was over then the book was all the but with different people and a crazy GrandmaNEVER READ PLEASE
5,great book,I loved this book. First real book i ever read. It was my geatway book. Never stoped reading after this. I will always hold a special place in my heart for this book.
3,Book Review,"Homecoming is a novel about four children from a house by an ocean. They're mother abandon them because the was practically crazy. They found their grandmother after a long journey of sleeping next to highways, stealing food, and surviving off whatever they could find. At first their grandmother did not except them, and really just wanted to be alone. After they did some jobs for her, she began to like them, and appreciate them and they stayed with her. Even though the book was repeating itself the entire time, it was overall a good story."
2,Ouch,I was kinda disappointed in this book.I thought the same thing kept happening over again and became predictable. The Tillermans kept running into problems and then finding there way out. My class was reading the book and our teacher couldn't keep up because EVEN she thought it was pretty boring. We ended up not finishing the book. I do not recommend this book to youth readers.
2,Homecoming,I thought the book Homecoming by Cynthia Voigt had a great story line. In the story the family was abandoned by their mother in a mall parking lot. The four Tillerman children always had hope of getting to a family member. My reading class was reading this book. We had to stop reading this book halfway through. Most of my classmates and I felt that the book was repeating itself. In my opinion i did not really need to know what they had for dinner every night. This book would have been a lot better if it was shorter and got to the point faster.
3,different children's book,"I read this book as an adult and in the beginning enjoyed reading about the four siblings adventures. What I did not enjoy was the way the author depicted the mother's mental illness and Maybeth perhaps being retarded.This book was orginally written in 1981 so the attitude about such disabilites were not the same as today--and I didn't enjoy going back to that time period. I thought it was strange that a children's book would tackle tough mental issues, unsuccessfully.However, overall,I enjoyed the book, and was glad it had a happy ending."
1,Cake topper,"Used it only once last January 2011 for Grand kids birthday cake. Went to use it this year batteries dead, and extra batteries dead also and plastic cracked by battery insertion."
2,Keep Looking,"Not really that good of a book, I found I was forcing myself through it and would have stopped half way except I did not have anything else to read. To many other have done this and done it better. Keep Looking."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I bought this book because I wanted to make Mai-tai's. Unfortunatly the recipe is not for the modern day drink I'm used to but an older version. They said it was better, but I wanted the kind I'm used to ordering in restaurants. I returned the book."
1,Don't bother if you have Windows 7,"The fact that this company is still selling the product without a fix for working in Windows 7 is probably a sign about about the quality of the product itself. I followed all the suggested ""fixes"" including running the latest Quicktime in the backround and the sound still slowly degrades to the point of being unusable. I called Sibelius (which is a project in itself to get through to someone without having to pay) and their answer is that they don't have a fix, sorry. Next time I'll read the reviews before purchasing. :)"
5,Great gift for my granddaughter,My granddaughter who is 8 borrows her teachers copy of this all the time. We looked at local book exchange store and could not find it and then I thought I bet it available at Amazon...it was. My granddaughter who says she is going to be a vet loves it. Now she has her own copy and won't have to borrow the teachers.....
5,Excellent product,"Gave this as a gift for my wife at Christmas. Virtually no set up, it works out of the box. My wife LOVES it. She checks it all the time. Real accurate weather data."
3,Nice Product But Needs A Little Tuning,"Purchased this unit for my wife a year ago and she really likes it, but wishes it showed todays forecast. You need to remember what it said yesterday about what is supposed to happen today.We just purchased the Brookstone weather station and have noticed the following:Brookstone is much smaller and does not need an electrical outlet - it runs off of two AA batteries. It does show today's weather forecast. The Brookstone display is smaller so you need to be a little closer to read it."
2,Doesn't work in our town.,"Sounded like a great idea to have MSN pick up the weather signal so we could see a 3-5 day forecast of the weather...however, the device would not work in our area no matter where we located it in the house."
2,A little cheesy and no instruction,I thought maybe I had missed a section of the DVD because there is absolutely no instruction to the routine. It's a five minute routine which Ms. Lin takes roughly eight minutes to explain. That's it-that's the entire video. She probably spent a lot more time dressing/applying make-up for this than she did making the actual routine. I could watch a cheesy video on youtube and keep replaying it for the same effect and it would be free.
4,Probably a pre-publication dummy cover,"Simon Stafford has written a lot of good books on Nikon products for Magic Lantern Press. Don't confuse a picture of the cover -- which may well have been nothing but a dummy done prepublication -- with the contents of the book. The editorial description of the camera which accompanies the Amazon listing is correct.Don't run down the book if you haven't read it yet! Based on the extreme utility and quality of Stafford's D70 and D50 books, I'm giving this on the D200 what I would have given his previous books."
4,"OK - manual extension, not a guide to using camera","This is, for all intents and purposes, a manual for the camera written in clearer English. It does not include anything along the lines of the Field Guide books that give pointers on which lenses and settings to use for which shooting situations with your D200 -- still, this is a great ""manual"" replacement and much easier to understand and follow than the manual that comes with camera."
3,D200 Helpful Information,I found the book was very complete and helpful in providing guidance in some features and applications. The book is essentially the manual that should have come with the D200 to begin with. The illustrations and photographs are average at best. Maybe my eyes are getting bad but I could hardly read some of the icons they refer to. Still I found the guidance and recommendations make sense and are helpful.
4,An Antidote for Nikon Instruction Book,"After my experience with the D70 Nikon instructions, I ordered this book at the same time I ordered my D200 camera. I have not yet looked at the Nikon book but relied on this guide to set up my camera for many different photo environments. I carry this book in my camera bag at all times. I heartily recommend it."
2,A Better Version of the D200 Manual,"This is a better version of the D200 Manual. I find the digital field guide for D200 a better version overall. I was confused which book is better so I bought both (Magic Lantern for D200 and Digital Field Guide for D200) for comparison. I would have preferred to have the pictures and illustrations in color. This book is very bland and the presentation boring compared to the digital field guide. If you are an amateur and want to know how to use the camera as well as learn new shooting tips on the different events, I suggest to get the Digital Field Guide by David Busch."
2,"Good book, bad binding",Excellent perspective on operation of D200. Especially good section on flash photography. Poor quality binding. Pages come loose when manual is fully opened up.
2,better manual?,"This book is like a better manual for the d200. Ok explanations of the simpler features, BUT when it comes to more advanced features like the autofocus system, it barely scratches the surface.Also the photographs in the book are BAD! Only B&Ws; and supposedly there to illustrate something, but they are just thrown in. Avoid the book!"
4,A great reference,I have a magic lantern book for all my cameras. It does an excellent job explaining the camera features and accessories. Highly recommended
4,Almost All In,"When the Worlds Series of Poker started, the best poker player was chosen by a vote! Tidbits such as this make this an essential guide to the history of the burgeoning event. A lack of hand records makes some of the reconstruction of questionable reliability, however.There is very little analysis of the hands, although the match-turning decisions are recounted well enough. There are insightful bios into some of the players, including Stu Ungar, who had won three tournaments during the time the increasing size made this an incredible feat. Recommended for those with an historical interest in the event and the growth of the popularity of poker."
4,e e cummings poems applicable to today's society,"kennedy delivers an effective compilation and frames it with an introduction that explains how amazing this poet really is. in a world dominated by hypocracy veiled in meaningless procedures and technicalities, and supported by misguided veneration of randomly applied rule of law, cummings' poems serve to expose lies and the transcendence of values in western society. there is a great deal to learn from e e cummings. This book is a good start."
5,Selected Poems by E. E. Cummings,Given as a gift and I got a great big kiss for it. Nothing else needs to be said. Great book!
4,Classic Alistair Maclean style,As the title suggests this is a standard alistair maclean book. It is a simple stoty about a secert service agent who hunts down a gang of bullion pirates. The pirates are ruthless and will kill anyone who comes in their way. In course of his investigation agent Calvert losses a number of his associates. A beautiful girl is sent by the pirates to keep watch over the agent. She is out smarted by Calvert. There are some efforts at puuting comic relief by means of Calvert boss and some of his associates. A book that I have read every second year for last 7 years and still I keep reading it...
1,Outdated,I can't believe I paid $10 for this. Maybe I missed the production date of 1976 before buying. It is SO outdated and has been redone 50 times on the SciFi channel show 'UFO Files'. Amazon should not be advertising this product.
5,It is a second skin but with style,"This jersey fits well, looks great, breaths well and is priced well. It is a hard to forget type jersey. If you are going somewhere, might as well lokk good doing it.The vendor was also great in support of the sale as well."
2,Lots of coloured pictures,"Small book with lots of coloured pictures, not what I wanted. Hardly any information, about 6 written pages."
5,Gotta Have This Funk,"This compliation of favorites from the Funk mob is a keeper. I purchased this funk to stay funked in my car and to date, it has not disappointed me. If you want to have this hits, this is a CD for you. I am not big on buying every Greatest Hits CD out there--it's usually the same songs with some minor differences. If you are a ""Nut for PFunk"" like I am, I buy some just because I don't have that picture in my collection. I now have ""The PFunk Earth Tour"" on DVD so I don't need all the CD covers--this is one that you will want to ""funkify"" your PFunk collection and it's cool to have for the parties without pulling out your entire collection--PFunk is a state of mind, a condition for............."
1,wouldnt be bad except,"This would be a good buy, except in my opinion overstock has a better set up for shipping. The money that you pay for an item this large should get you something more than a 5 day window of when you will recieve it. I had two screw holes that were not tapped and had i not had a working knowledge of how to fix it, than I would've had to send it back. Looks fantastic in our kitchen though."
2,"Too many metaphors, not enough info.",I found this book to be full of silly metaphors (as if that's the only way we could relate to Dr. Twerski). It just didn't get me the information I needed. Perhaps others would find it motivational.
1,Bad deal,We got the item 2 weeks later than scheduled date. The base came cracked from top to bottom. We couldn't return it because we'll be losing 2 expenses 15% of shipping and new shipping charges. It's still laying in our house un-assembled because we're looking for a carpenter's fix.
5,excellent first novel,"well first to be her first novel she kept me reading non stop. I loved it. most people think men has a fear of marriage but what cherlyn does is gives a woman point of view when it comes to getting married. She kept me constantly reading just to see what was going to happen to van relationship with alton. Her book never left me wondering about characters because you knew what was going on with other characters. and when she made mention to all of st. louis landmarks, school(roosevelt representing !!) and hangout you felt as though you was in st. louis i'm waiting for the next novel. you now can count me as your biggest fan. thank you for writing.wanita"
4,A new twist,"Counting Raindrops offers a new twist on the relationship spectrum. This time it is about Vanella Morris, a woman bent on avoiding committments. This novel will capture the reader's attention from start to finish with its twists and turns coupled with family drama."
5,I cried,"This book was excellent! I liked how it was so discriptive, Ifelt like I was there. Also, so true about the men!I willrecommed this book to all my friends and family."
1,A really amateurish film in all respects!,"I am a time travel fan and bought this one for my collection, but what a deception! The script, the acting and the directing is as its worse! The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it can be used as a teaching tool to learn what not to do in all aspects of movie making and acting. Although it is a 1986 movie, I think that a couple of teenagers could have done something better with a home movie camera... in the 60's! That's how bad it is. The dialogue is mediocre, the acting is as its worst, the ""special effects"" (if they can be called that) are of the worst kind. I am talking about ""Time warp"", and won't even try to begin watching the other one. In summary, this movie is not worth your time nor your money."
3,God knows whats in store for the future.,These are just a couple of decent movies that might make you think. From all im learning they have made progress through a radiation technique to move an object seconds in time. Maybe someday they will be able to transport people in time as well. It something to think about.
4,Warp Speed review,I first saw this movie on a Saturday night twenty years ago. I searched diligently for many years to find it again but to no avail. Fortunately I came across it on amazon at a very reasonable price and and the shipping time was very punctual. The movie revolves around the efforts of a psychic portrayed by Camille Mitchell to discover why a spacecraft was discovered abandoned with no crew. The ending is quite memorable and unexpected.
3,Good but not great,"I chose this book because I had been reading some shorter biographies on George Washington and I became interested in the ""truth"" about his faith. This book hits on some interesting points but the writing style is very choppy (the author constantly goes back and forth in time) and the style of narrative just didn't draw this reader in. David McCullough's epic volume on John Adams - as long and detailed as it is - proves that an author can provide tremendous detail and still keep the reader wanting to turn the page to learn more. Still, for some strong evidence that George Washington was no passive deist, but actually had a compelling Christian faith, one can turn to Washington's God as a good source of information."
2,"Interesting History, but Inconclusive Theory","I got a lot of great information from this book, but the overall theory that George Washington was a deeply religious man was inconclusive. The authors presented evidents that can surely be interpreted multiple ways. The presentation was a little too informal for my taste too. The Novaks used a great amount of primary resources, but presented it in a many of an underaged school report. I believe that is just how George Washington would have wanted it in the end though. I don't believe George Washington was an aethist and clearly he writes on regular occassion about God and the importance of freedom of religion. However, his personal feelings don't necessarily shine through because he was such a private man and took measures to protect his privacy. We will never truley know the answer to George Washington's personal views on religion and our first President is likely very satisfied at that!"
3,HUH,"if your that desperate try going to Ebay they have a copy of the DVD veriosn with four DVD Discs with all 40 episodes right now, im not sure but i think its being bidded on as we speak, but if u want it try searching for it at a classic video store etc. or ebay if you do find it on ebay then buy it or bid for it, im too scared to buy it from ebay dont trust them, but you can give it a shot and if you get the copy tell me manill buy a copy of it lol."
4,Beautiful and Interesting!,I love this pendant and have gotten many many compliments on it. Tiny little flowers are formed in a beautiful pattern. Colors vivid and well placed. Only issue was that the chain that came with it turned black from wearing it only a few days. I purchased a shiny nickel/silver chain from Amazon to replace the blackened chain but this added to the cost of the whole set. Still I bought another pendant for my niece when she left for college last month. You will love it too but buy a chain when you buy the pendant and save yourself time.
4,Pendant,This is a gift for my granddaughter and is a very pretty murano glass pendant which will go with a lot of her outfits. I am pleased with it.
4,Buen todo terreno,"Lo compré para utilizarlo en viajes y paseos familiares, lo utilizo con mi Olympus E 620, y va de maravillas, si bien no es un lente pro su desempeño va de acuerdo a lo anunciado, para mí lo mejor es que se pasa a las focales largas con tan solo un golpe de muñeca, bastante atractivo su comportamiento en exteriores, en interiores hay que encontrarle el truco para que se comporte con luz baja, pero para eso están los flash que lo dejan a la altura de un objetivo pro en cuanto a calidad de imagen.Totalmente recomendable para quienes no desean viajar o salir con la familia y cargar varios objetivos, en esos casos es de suma utilidad."
3,one good new song,"All the old songs on this are great, but most Who fans will already have them. Of the two new songs, only one is good in my opinion: Old Red Wine. The other one, Real Good Looking Boy, is just goofy. I agree with the other reviewers who feel that the new songs should have just been issued as a single instead of as part of a superfluous compilation.Ivan Rorick"
1,Why?...,"I completely agree with what Julio Cesar said.1 - Why would anyone buy yet another compilation that consists of EXACTLY the same songs you see favored on every other Who compilation. It was so refreshing to FINALLY see that someone else (Cesar) recognizes the songs he mentioned. I consider myself the biggest Who fan out there along with everyone else who considers themselves the biggest fan, but there's no need for this CD.2 - It's too short. You need not 1, but 2 CDs to comprise a decent Who comp album that spans their 20 years, and3 - It only consists of 1 song each from 'Who By Numbers', Who Are You', & 'Face Dances', and with nothing from 'It's Hard'.The ONLY thing this CD is good for is for the release of the 2 new songs. That's it. And I'll gladly wait for a new album if it ever happens with them. Not that it'll ever be The Who anyyway w/o Keith & John, but that's a whole 'nuther story.So to sum it up - Why bother?"
1,More greatest hits albums than original releases...,"The Who are getting close. This pains me that there are so many releases of the same material because The Who is my favorite rock band.Is this release worth purchasing because of the two new songs? NO, these new songs just don't sound like The Who. It sounds more like solo Roger Daltrey or a Demo from Who Are You.Just wretched."
3,"Sub-par compilation, or start of something new?","The Who have been rock legends for years and I was skeptical to say the least when I heard of this. Another greatest hits? The Ultimate Collection was just released in '02. The compiling was... okay. The absence of Baba O'Riley was a surprise and also the inclusion of The Kids Are Alright over Anyway Anyhow Anywhere. This is probably the best place to start if you don't want to pay the extra cash for the two disc anthology, and the inclusion of the new tracks makes me wonder about whether they're going to make that new album that Pete Townshend hinted about in the Rolling Stone interview. The new songs really sound like a cross between 'Chinese Eyes' era Townshend and 'Quadrophenia' era Who, and I really like them. Basically not worth it unles you are a completist, really want new songs, or just starting out."
4,"Great Who compilation of old and 'new""","This is a great compilation of some of the Who's best tracks from classic, to mondern. In addition, two newer tracks not found on any album of new songs are thrown in. Real Good Looking Boy is a great song that matches just about any Who classic. Also included is a song reflecting on Entwhistle."
5,A primer and beyond,"When a band like The Who releases something new, we are often reminded of the difference between true legendary talent and over hyped modern media junk (i.e. Britney, Eminem, or any other of the rubbish that you find on VH1 or MTV these days) The sad thing is that no matter how good these two new songs are, and they are great, they won't get played on today's radio. Even most classic rock stations will avoid the new recordings of classic artists lately and will only stick with their obvious hits. If you don't belive me, look at Fleetwood Mac, ZZ Top, and even that Eagles CD Single of the past year. All of these were great, but they never were played or put into even a medium rotation. It is by word of mouth now that we hear about these recordings and now I'm suggesting these two new tracks as good editions to The Who catalog."
5,The Who are always great. Even many compilations later.,"This album should only be reviewed on its own merits. Looking at other past compilations dilutes the idea that this set can have its own strong impact. If it hadn't been for an old 70's compilation -Hooligans(never in print on CD), I may never have been clued into what an amazing band The WHO are. That being said, this is a great compilation. The new songs are cool, and Real Good Looking Boy goes back to the formula of Pete writing something that is better communicated through Roger's voice. The song selection is good for a primer. Hopefully, some 14 year old buys this and is moved to go deeper as I did. If this package can do that, and I see no reason why it couldn't, then it is an outstanding CD. Oh, in addition, I really do like the packaging."
3,"3,5 stars - Good collection, but it could be a double pack","Well, this is the legendary The Who, folks! And it's a good collection of songs for people who never heard of the band (is that possible?), but it could be another double pack, like ""The Ultimate Collection"". A lots of great songs are missing here: ""A Legal Matter"", ""Boris The Spider"", ""I'm Free"", ""The Seeker"", ""Baba O'Riley"" (a huge sin!), ""Join Together"", ""Relay"". In spite of that, it's OK for the songs that have in it. The new songs with Greg Lake and Zak Starkey, ""Real Good Looking Boy"" (a tribute to the eternal king Elvis Presley) and ""Old Red Wine"" are both really brilliant!! A very good return. In the beggining I was afraid, looking for some marketing and comercial return of the band, with mediocre songs, but after the first listen, I got touched for them!! The Who are back again, and I hope to see them soon!! I'm also looking forward to see the new studio album of these old and brilliant guys!!"
3,"Not Enough Here, Plain and Simple","At first glance, this looked like a pretty good choice, seeing as there were 20 tracks on the CD and it looked like even more than that from the way they crammed the track listing on the back of the album. And yes, normally, 20 tracks is a lot to have on one CD. On a ""Best of"" The Who collection, however, 20 is far too few tracks to satisfy. The two new tracks didn't really influence my purchase much, it just seemed like a lot of bang for the buck at first. But it really isn't. As other reviewers have pointed out, while the music is excellent (I mean, it's impossible to pick up a BAD The Who album), this review doesn't do their incredible legacy any kind of justice. I would point any potential buyer in the same direction others have pointed: The Who Ultimate Collection."
1,GET SOME PURPLE INSTEAD!,"My two favorite bands have new releases out,Deep Purple and The Who. The new one from DP is great,50 minutes of good music making. I'm proud to be a fan.The Who on the other hand, just come up with two songs hereand a bunch of tired classics. The new songs are pretty good,but Purple are shining much brighter now.Deep Purple - Bananas: 5 starsThe Who - Then and Now: 1 1/2 stars"
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"I am a Who fan who would buy almost anything from this band (And that includes the boxed set), but not this CD. Everyone who knows ANYTHING about The Who knows that Pete has no morals (Remember ""Rude Boy""?), so the fact that he has put a controversial song (Which will remain nameless) out AFTER being flagged as a sex offender should suprise no one. It should not shock anyone either that they will try and milk fans to death (Remember, they did not cancel their tour after John died), the only way to stop this is very simple: Do not go out any buy this or any other ""NEW"" WHO CD. Instead,if you purchase other CDs (Like The Ultimate Collection) you get the songs you want (This CD not having Baba O' Riley, is a disgrace onto itself), without feeling cheated. Another CD to avoid like the plague, because it is a waste of money."
2,Close but not quite,"the best of The Who. I love love love The Who but i must admit that listening to ""Real Good Looking Boy"" was painful. These guys have put out some of the best, most thought provoking, affecting music i have ever had the great joy to hear. But this is just sad. How many best of albums and box sets does one band need?"
2,beating a dead horse,"Jeez, how many times and ways can what's left of The WHO put out greatest hits recordings. 2 new songs - big deal! Do they really need money this bad?"
3,Not worth the two new songs,"I own the Ultimate Who and it is hysterical because the track listing is identical minus the added songs on The Ultimate Who's 2 CD's. For a second there I almost thought I owned this CD too because it is sequenced exactly the same. You are better off purchasing the Ultimate Who set as it is far superior to this offering.As for the two new tracks I am not entirely sure they justify the purchase of a redundant disc. Real Good Looking Boy is my personal favorite of the two. It's a song about Elvis Presley and I got to see them perform it live in Uncasville, CT. Old Red Wine is an ok track but somewhat forgettable.If you have the means buy the Ultimate Who or any other major compilation and hit Itunes or something up for the other 2."
3,WHO do you think you're fooling?,"THEN AND NOW: 1964-2004 is another of the many superfluous WHO collections to come down the pike in the past 20 years. So what if it contains two 21st Century post-Entwhistle mediocrities? Those songs are forgettable anyway.Unless you're a completist, consider purchasing only:MEATY BEATY BIG AND BOUNCY,TOMMYandTHE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT. That's enough WHO for anybody.TOTAL PLAYING TIME -- 77:04"
5,The Who Then and Now is fantastic,I bought this cd yesterday to hear the two new Who songs Real Good Looking Boy and Old Red Wine.I was not disapointed at all.You have to go to Petes web site at petetownshend.com and go into petes diaries and see the notes dated Feb 27 2004.Pete describes the complete background of these two new songs.I can not wait to see the band play these two new songs live at the Hollywood Bowl this summmer.
3,Two New Songs are the Best Part of a Needless Compilation,"This is probably the lowest rating I`d give any Who album, simply because the only reason to buy it are the two new Who songs. The new songs aren`t bad, but they really don`t merit buying an entire CD (unless you`re a crazy fan like me). So unless you are trying to build your own Who library and need those two songs, I really don`t think I could recommend this CD to anyone.If you need a compilation of The Who, get The Ultimate Collection or 30 Yrs Maximum R & B. If you`re new to The Who, go see a live Who concert (they`re still great even with just two), buy Live At Leeds or even Live at the Royal Albert Hall (sans Keith), get Who`s Next, Quadrophenia, The Who Sell Out, My Generation . . . Tommy isn`t bad either.My point is that there is so much great Who stuff out there and so much unreleased Who music why spend your money on a compilation that offers less than the one released just a couple years ago?"
4,Cute,"My daughters love this outfit. It is cute on. The shoes are precious too. It comes with a ring, but that has been lost since we opened the package. Worth buying for such an inexpensive price."
1,Pseudo-scientific nonsense,"A great disappointment! The author proposes to prove that animals have a rich emotional range that humans can understand and interact with, but offers no rigorous evidence whatever! His argument is to repeat again and again assertions along the lines of ""People who work with animals a LOT will certainly tell you that animals really do experience emotions"". Well, there it is: the whole book in a nutshell. Anyone hoping for revealing research and authoritative insights will be left wanting. What drivel! Save your money and watch some pop-expose on E! instead -- it'll be more engaging and far more scientific."
2,Could have been much better.,"While this was a great idea for a book the book itself was poorly pieced together. It was like an incredibly long argumentative essay. I can't help but wonder why it would have been written this way considering almost all of the readers are in agreement before they picked up the book. If the author was hoping to convince some nonbelievers from a scientific perspective there should have been less guilt and anecdotes. The scraps of science that did make their way into this book were shaky to say the least. I read this book a few years ago but don't remember reading anything about statistical significance... could be my memory.It was more frustrating that uplifting. I did enjoy some of the cutsey stories but wouldn't put weight on them.I agree with another reviewer who said this book is more a ""projection of human emotion onto animals."""
3,Interesting look at emotion,"This book examines evidence of emotions in animals. Masson constantly plays to his audience - animal lovers, so though he uses a rather vast array of documentation and philosophies to argue both sides of the argument, the reader is constantly told to think of their own experience. And, as a dog owner, it is hard to imagine anyone saying that a dog isn't ecstatic when you come home, or say yes to a long walk, or is seemingly heartbroken when you won't throw the tennis ball for the hundredth time. The various anecdotal support for animals across the animal kingdom are the strongest parts of the book, and more of these anecdotes would have been welcome! Ultimately, the thick vein of recounting the many terrible things humans have done against animals turns a book that could have been entertaining to read, into something more serious and depressing. And while I did enjoy reading this, I had a lot more fun reading his A-Z menagerie of animals book."
5,A must read!,"At first I skeptical about the importance of this book. But now that I have read it, I can't wait to read it again and wait for a sequel! It thoroughly examines the emotions that we have not noticed in animals. It has helped me regard animals as individuals whose rights we are morally obligated to respect."
2,spends more time trashing scientists than discussing animals,"I was really disappointed in this book. No reasonable scientist today denies that many animals have emotions, thoughts, and consciousness; unfortunately, this book spends too much time trashing scientists and not enough time on its main topic."
1,How does this rubbish sell?,"This turned up in the 'books people are raving about' section. Since there are some good reviews showing what utter rubbish the book is, this is clearly not true. Maybe there are not enough people raving about books that are actually good - or too many people raving (literally) about unscientific nonsense."
2,"Not so great in the first place, it is now wildly outdated.","As someone who is studies emotions and decision making, I was looking forward to reading this book. While the author offers (and repeats, and repeats) considerable anecdotal evidence for animal emotion, there is little concrete science to support the claims.Furthermore, the field of emotion-cognition study in humans is still coming into its own and has grown exponentially since 1996. Indeed, we now understand many human emotions better than in 1996. Naturally, when comparing humans and animal emotions, these advances dramatically change our understanding and therefore draw into question many of the inferences made in the book.Not a great book to begin with. However, a decade after its release, it is borderline useless."
2,arrogant authors,"What a piece of crap! I agree with the overall point the authors attempted to make, but they spent so much time bashing humans while offering so little support for their argument that I want to disagree. The authors should stick to something they know something about."
1,The book for the Disney believing Brain dead.,"It is a good thing that people that read this trash are city dwelling buffoons otherwise this author would starve. Only people that have no real time spent in the wild with real nature could read this book with out wondering if this author IQ is as high as those animals he pretends to understand. Throw this book away and go rent the trails of life or visit us in Alaska and see the truth for yourself, stupid is not the way to go through life."
3,Loved it ... .but too anthropomorphic,"Jeffrey Moussaieff's book offered a nice range of examples on various emotions. I enjoyed reading it, but I thought that some of the examples were questionable and displayed too much of an anthropomorphic view of animals.I strongly believe that animals do have emotions. It wouldn't even be conceivable to me that they would just live without any emotions. Jeffrey goes a long way in proving that they do, using a variety of examples. However, I'm not sure about who the reader for this book is. Is it the people who already know that animals have emotions and love them so much that they wanted to read and learn more about it? Or is it the person who doesn't have a clue about it, nor cares to know? I would say the former.He has great points and I enjoyed reading it. Some great stories and eye opening facts.I would highly recommend it."
5,Helped me go vegetarian!,"This book was life changing for me. I always loved animals and really always wanted to be a vegetarian, but I never was able to live the way I really wanted. This book is not about vegetarianism at all, what it does is illuminates the emotional lives of animals. Most of us KNOW that animals have emotions, but we don't really think about it. This book expands your thinking and really allows you to appreciate and respect animals in a new, more profound way. It was after reading this book that I began to lose the desire to eat animals. I am truly, truly grateful for this book. I have been a vegetarian for 6 years now! Who would have thunk!"
2,Misleading Title,Although by all means i do not disagree with the moral compassion of this book and found the research ... although highly bias...enlightning ...i was hoping to read about elephants. my bad for not reading a sample before pressing buy...but still a bit dissapointed that this book has very little to offer about elephants.
3,More Science Than Entertainment,"Worth the read, but sometimes slow. Has some interesting information. Unfortunately, since nothing at the beginning of the book or on each page clues you in to the fact that there are notes supporting and providing more background to the statements in the book, you might miss the opportunity to connect some statements to the sources. So look at the notes in the back - listed by page number - along with reading the book."
1,Unscientific emotional guff!,I wss hoping to find some insights into animal behaviour that would help fill out the picture being painted by sociobiology and evolutionary biology. I was very sadly disappointed. This is just a book for people who like puppies with big soulful eyes - it is not add anything interesting to our knowledge of the world
1,A Celebration of the Anthropic Fallacy,"This book is unfortunately nothing more than the projection of human emotions onto animals from an entirely subjective viewpoint. The authors want animals to have human like responses- and so they do.Do animals have emotions in the same sense that humans do? Very possibly, especially among the higher animals. Does this book add anything to the debate? No."
4,Afterlaugh by Meg Hentges,This is a wonderful collection from Meg Hentges. I love her thinking and presentation. Her music is lively and fun to hear and this stays in the mix.
4,Iggy Pop - 'Hippodrome - Paris '77' (Revenge) 4 1/2 stars,"Alright,now THIS is more like it.An eleven track live performance from an early Iggy tour,mind you.This might've been his very first European solo outing.From his 'Lust For Life' trek.The sound isn't perfect,but outside of a few moments of annoying feedback,'Hippodrome-Paris '77' is a darn good live release.Some killer cuts include ""Lust For Life"",""Passenger"",the rarely played Mitch Ryder cover ""C.C.Rider/Jenny Take A Ride"" and a couple of Stooges numbers ""Raw Power"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"".Line-up:Iggy-vocals,Stacey Heydon-guitar,former Stooges member Scott Thurston-keyboards,Tony Sales-bass and Hunt Sales-drums.A must-have."
4,There worst album but still awsome,Iowa is there best work done. This album is still amazing Vermilion is a good song and i recommend this cd
5,Slipknot is the best band ever!!!!!!,"Slipknot is the best metal ever to hit the earth!! I am a die hard maggot and i love every album they have ever come out with. The Namless is my personal favorite because, it is the perfect blend of screaming, talking and great guitar lines. As for ""As I lay Dying"". Screw them. The pail in comparison to Slipknot. Slipknot is the best metal band ever and always will be."
2,title not necessary,"Slipknot proves their talentless efforts in their latest release. Face it-this band is just out there to make money and thats all they care about. How else could you explain this horrid cd: they try so hard to appeal to every genre of music. The outcome is one God-awful record. If you like it, go ahead and pick it up-its your money. It will bore you soon after a few listens. But by all means everyone needs to stop calling this crap metal. If the band calls themself a metal band, this is really a poor attempt at it.In my opinion-this band has some serious problems. They arent psychopaths or serial killers or hate filled satan worshippers, but they do have some rare case of ADD-that in which if they dont get any attention they'll probably run off into a corner and cry. This project is all for show. The only thing worth taking a look at is the percussion. Everything else will just bore you within a few weeks"
1,Slipknots Sucks,Slipknot is the worst band on the planet. They just Suck. They have no talent. They just just yell and scream while headbanging. Its getting very old.
1,slipknot blows,"im not 13. i hate nu metal. people need to understand that this is crap. they need to listen to real metal, maiden, priest, crue, van halen. slipknot korn and other queer bands like that need to go to hell and take 50 cent with them"
2,Reviews Reviews Reviews!!!,"I'm sorry slipknot fans, I did not like this cd very much at all! Have slipknot lost their touch? The only song on this album that I actually do like and love the video for is Duality! The album is a little to much on the soft side for my liking but this could be a way for slipknot to appeal and widen their audience who knows.... One star is too harsh especially as duality is an excellent song so i'm giving it 2 stars and hope for better and bigger things on future albums"
5,Subliminal verses,"Vol. 3 the Subliminal Verses By: SlipknotSlipknot is an awesome band straight out of Iowa. They are extremely heavy but well-loved by all head bangers. This cd is a good choice for all the metal heads out there. It's very dark and heavy just like all of Slipknot's other cd's. Most of the songs are around four minutes long, and there are fifteen tracks, two of which aren't extremely heavy. Slipknot is an awesome band to skateboard to because the music they play is really fast and aggressive just like my skate style.Corey, the lead singer, has amazing vocals and he really shows it with this cd. This cd is good to listen to when you're angry at someone because it will help get your anger out without hurting somebody. I think this is a good cd for everyone who loves metal. Slipknot's cd's don't have swears in them which means no parental advisory. I think this cd is the best Slipknot cd to date and I can't wait for the next one!"
3,Where To Begin...Where To Begin,"This CD is Slipknot's highly anticipated 2004 release. It is good, but compared to the band's older work it sucks. The CD is good. Its just that nothing on it surpasses any of their older works. The accoustic guitar songs on the CD are suprisingly great (especially ""Circle""), and its heavier tracks, like ""Vermilion"", are great. But, really there is just nothing special here. ""Opium of The People"" and ""Three Nil"" are great songs. Other good songs include the album's lead single (""Duality""), ""The Blister Exists"", ""Vermilion, Pt. 2"", ""Nameless"", and ""Before I Forget"". Well, if you are a hardcore maggot than this is definetely a must have. If you aren't a really big fan of the band, than you'd be better of picking up Iowa instead."
2,ok...,"Slipknot's First Cd = 54%Iowa = 45%This = 55%so, slipknot doesnt look they are gonna get better any time soon. They would be better if all songs were like Duality. If they wanted to be better, how bout no rapping. You have 3 guitars, make it useful, not 2 guys playing the same thing the whole song then mick or whatever doing some other thing. ...no solos, which is a bad thing, it shows that the guitarists are not good enough to do solos? Or does it show that they are too obsessed with doing intro verse chorus verse chorus verse last chorus ending? Maybe if they did Intro Verse Chorus Verse Chorus SOLO ""1, BRIDGE, SOLO ""2, VERSE, CHORUS, ENDING, they would be better. Hope they read this and fix their ways"
3,this album is alright,"The album isn't as good as the the first album and 2nd one IOWA.....they didn't had barely any swearing in it.....it looks like that band is running out of ideas as far as lyrics is concern but the melody is good although.....but it isn't bad for a main stream band although, I'm not really into bands that's play on the radio that you hear every where you go.Only some main stream bands I like besides slipknot...is system of a down, mariyan manson, nine inch nails, ozzy osburne, black sabbath....that's it.Godsmack is hard rock not metal."
2,Pulse of the fa**ots if you ask me.,"first off, I am not a devout slipknot fan. with that said...The self title album. The blue prints that made slipknot what they are. Catchy and unique.Iowa-Harder, Darker and better....Change is sometimes a good thing but when you totally abandon your roots well this is what you get = Volume 3.To soft! cory's choruses are aggravating and drawn out. 1/3 of this album is experimental. the other 2/3 are decent but nothing special. this is the de-evolution of slipknot. Stonesour influence has inpregnated slipknot and ruined what little credibility this band once possessed."
1,A perfect cd for the immature,"I'm an avid metal fan. I listen to ALOT of heavy metal. I can tell you right now, this band is NOT real heavy metal. It's shock value and nothing more. Don't believe me? Count how many times they say F**K in one song, and how they sing about raping dead corpses, all while wearing their crazy and ""scary"" masks so that everyone will think they're ""hardkore"". When you get down to the bare bones of it, Slipknot is doing nothing more then feeding off of shock value, just like alot of other games, moves, and bands I could think of. If you really do want good metal, check out these bands, for they actually have talent.Lamb of GodImmortalInto EternityDark TranquilityI hope this has been helpful to you.P.S. The bands I listed you have probably never heard of, because they don't shove their music videos and products down your throat."
5,Better than Iowa,"Just picked this up. This is a really good album. I heard they mellowed out and went soft but they actually didn't. The music is top notch and shows they can truly play their instruments well. From the brutal to the beautiful, this album rocks."
2,Slipknot has gone down hill,"I've heard the album, I hate to admit that after the first two Albums Slipknot has gone downhill. Where is the rugged hard sound that they used to have. Only a few songs on the album have that sound, that is why i gave it 2 stars. Is it worth the few dollars to purchase, ""yes"" if you are a hardcore slipknot fan, ""No"" if you only liked a few of their songs to begin with. I myself may not be getting this album. The rest is solely up to you all."
1,A low rating and for good reason.,"What a heap of crap. ANyone who likes this can go and put their head down the toilet, because I'd rather do that than buy or listen to this crap ever again.FAKE BORING NOISY CRAPPY MUSIC.They said this would be their last album and for good reason, you can't make more than three albums of screaming and shouting and expect stupid fools to keep buying it - then again it still would'nt surprise me."
2,Unimpressive yell rock,"What a disappointment! After hearing Slipknot's hard core hits ""Duality"" and ""Before I Forget"" off this C.D., I expected that the rest of the album would probably be equally glorious. Instead my ears were insulted by track after track of senseless shouting and uninteresting rhythms, which basically seemed like they had been made up on the spot. Pretty much the only good non-hit melody is ""The Nameless"", which is a lot less loud but has a better sense of beat than most of the album has. It is a shame that Slipknot has so many random and slapdash songs, for this seems to hide the skill of the relatively talented guitarists in the band. I would quite definitely not recommend this C.D., but I would suggest that the singles be bought separately since they stand out quite prominently among the non-hit tunes."
2,The Story of a Sellout,"What happened, Slipknot? I wil ltell you, you let Corey Taylor right your songs. This cd goes from great to awful, and makes me want ot hurl. It cannot compare to Iowa, or S/T. Slipknot is not the type of band that goes from Surfacing to Vermillion. It saddens me to see this happen. The great parts are The Blister Exists, Three Nil, Duality, and Opium of the People. Everything from this point...collapses. Vermillion? Now with a music video that is fully equipped with crap. Slipknot is dead, unless they can make a good cd after this, but since I really did like them at one point, I'll buy it."
1,Simply not good.,"I wrote a review about Slipknot's self-titled album and back then I thought they were one of the best up-and-coming bands around. They fell off a bit with the second album, in my opinion, but I thought they'd be able to get together and put up a solid third CD. I've officially lost all hope. If you liked the style of the first ablum, don't buy this. If you like a mix between Stone Sour and horrific, poorly contructed mainstream-y metal, than maybe _MAYBE_ you'd want to pick this up. I'd strongly suggest listening before you buy, however."
2,Slipknot = Metal? Please.,"I was a fan of slipknot untill this release. I can't believe people can call this ""metal"". Only get this album if you can deal with soft rock."
5,I love this cd,"I love this cd. I don't see how people say its not heavy? Theres still the heavy songs there but with melody, why have all 3 albums sound the same? What slipknot did this time was awesome. Songs with solos show the talent jim and mick have, the drums are still insane, corey sounds better then ever, they did a nice job with the acoustic songs too. Even though slipknot has changed u can still tell its them. Maggot Forever"
3,"A relativly good album, from a crazy band","Yes, myself, in all my metalness, listen to slipknot.(i know its hard to belive) Now before you piss yourself let me tell you a little about this album. Overall it is a resonably good album, better than the first one, about as good as iowa. Standout tracks include 'duality' 'the blister exists', and my favorite song on the album 'nameless'. There are a few almost pink floyd inspired oddities on this album too. Overall this is a good album, that is worth your money, but cirtainly dosnt match up to the likes of thousands of underground bands that will never make it to slipknots status."
5,Good music re-emerged,"This CD, thank God, is a re-emergence of talent which desperately lacked in Iowa. Sure it's not as hard all the way through, but as someone finally leaving my teens and maturing a bit I was glad to see that they abandoned the Iowa satanic approach which was more of a gimmic than anything. Eventually you mature a bit and you get sick of all that 666 crap, and you see through that. Iowa sucked. It was nothing more than Slipknot becoming a sideshow and Corey saw that. No wonder he wanted out. There's always a backlash when you change but it needed to happen or Slipknot would have faded away ala Gwar (and I already know everyone hates this comparison but it's true) . With efforts like this they may be around for a bit longer. This is REAL music."
2,Dumb,You know what? One day I went to Sam Goody and picked up this CD. I was about to by it when my friend said it sucks and I should listen to it first. So I scanned it and started to listen. I am forewer grateful to that freind. They're just a bunch of Goths that are beginner guitar players. And the lyrics either sound like idiotic whispering or the screaming that is cusromary of Goth music. Why 2 stars instead of one? U should have heard how bad their other CDs sounded.
2,lol zao is a christian band that blows them out of thewater,slipknot man they suck I have to say im sorry there just not very creative same retarded lyrics blah blah im mad go see a shrink.........
3,some day we might be as good as mushroomhead,This album was another below par attempt to cash in on the great mushroomhead phenom. Maybe if slipknot would try to produce something original instead of just ripping off another bands ideas;They might be good enough to make it through a whole set without getting heckled off stage with a hail of C batteries flying at their heads.
2,Stone Sour?,"Very dissapointing. Slipknot used to be heavy, now they sound like Stone Sour. Where's the anger in Coreys vocals? There's nothing like Heretic Anthem, or any of the good old songs on this album. There are only three good songs here. If I wanted to hear crap like this, I'd listen to Radiohead."
2,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP!!!!!,"First of all I've liked Slipknot from day 1. Before their major label release. So all you nu-metal babies shut the F up. This album is for the most part crap and a MAJOR let down. If i wanted to listen to stone sour i would kept it when i got that. I liked Knot because of the power, aggresion, anger, pure heavy kick in the mouth metal. Now they just sound like good old radio friendly (most of the songs) nu metal crap.They do still get me pissed off and angry but not in the same way. When i heard Rick Rubin was producing this cd i thought nothing could go wrong. Low and behold another heavy band that made their $$$ and then went soft. If your going to Ozzfest skip Slipknot and check out the real metal bands like LAMB OF GOD, HATEBREED, EVERY TIME I DIE."
2,Not Slipknot,"This is so not Slipknot. If you've heard Stone Sour, you'll realize this cd belongs to them, not Slipknot. Corey's vocals on this cd are just horrible. He doesn't even really scream anymore, which used to be really cool. He uses his clean voice more and while that might seem good, it actually isn't. i thought the drumming was pretty cool on this cd, that's why i gave it 2 stars, but besides that, there's not really anything worth listening to on this album."
5,Amazingly Melodic,"I have listened to Slipknot since the origional version of their self-titled cd was released (Had the song Purity on it) and I must say that this cd is as good if not better than the groups Roadrunner debut. While some fans may state that the band has sold out I simply believe that this was the direction they were meant to go in. I love every song on this album, even the acoustic songs, but they never lost any of their hard, frenzied feel. Songs such as Duality, The Blister Exsists, and Nameless still have the origional Slipknot feel. Pretty much anyone can appriciate the genious in this cd and I would suggest it to anyone that enjoys great rock music."
4,I was waitng for much more,"Subliminal is a good album. But where's tha hate of Slipknot?? If I wanted to listen to Stone Sour, I would bought a Stone Sour album! It seems that Corey and his bandmates let the industry took them down. Come back to the Hell, guys!"
2,Not too great,"I have alot of respect for Corey, and other members of Slipknot. However, I think that this album should not have been made at all. I think that Corey should have called it quits with Slipknot and just stuck with the stone sour thing. I really like older Slipknot, but this isn't them, this is like stone sour and slipknot thrown in a blender with a pinch of John Mayer maybe. I don't understand why they would do this to the Slipknot name, they already get enough crap for being ""numetal"" (whatever). I think that Corey and the boys wrote some great melodies but they are too catchy for Slpipknot, and they didn't even try with the more heavy parts. It's almost like just a bland filler until the ultra-catchy chorus. I recommend the new killswitch engage if you want a good CD.....Goodbye forever slipknot"
2,What the hell????,"Ok, I (used to) absolutely love Slipknot, but what is this radio-friendly piece of garbage??!!! I'm sorry, but this is not typical Slipknot, this is a typical move a band makes when they're trying to appeal to the radio and the masses and kill their true sound. This is not Slipknot, this is a mess of noise tied into an album. I know a lot of their fans may hate me for this review but you know what? If you understood TRUE Slipknot, you would probably think the same thing. ""Slipknot"" and ""Iowa"" were true Slipknot, this is media-sellout Slipknot. Then went extrememly melodic and soft on us all. If you are a TRUE Slipknot fan, you might get it to be loyal, but me, I'm not even bothering to."
2,THEIR BEST ALBUM!!!!,"i like some songs from VOL 3, like duality...in fact, i think this the best album from Slipknot...it's way more polished than the first 2, but that's better for a band like slipknot because while the songs sound the same, you can hear some clean vocals from Corey Taylor. and the guitars actually bring one or two melodies....as on ALL slipknot stuff, it's really hard to argue with the whole album, because all the songs are way similar with NO variation....well, slipknot is really not so good...if you want NU METAL, try korn, coal chamber and deftones...."
3,ok-but a little too different,come on!!!-every one saying this is slipknots best album must be on drugs!!-no way does it even come close to the sheer brutality and brilliance of iowa and as for the accoustic tracks-well one would have been bearable but 4????-hope they bring back ross robinson 2 produce the next album-rick rubin has all but taken away the sound that made this band so special in the 1st place
1,Worst album ever,"i'm not a kid. i just don't feel like getting a user name and all that. but anyway, this is the worst cd i ever bought. slipknot really sold out. anyone who takes this cd seriously has no idea what music is. the album ""mate feed kill repeat"" is the best cd this band ever made. and good luck getting a copy of that. (i got mine on ebay). the lyrics on this cd are drab and uninspired. not to mention generic ""i don't know what to do, when she makes me sad"" seriously. it's terrible. and this band can not write ballads. some metal bands have been able to pull it off. disturbed's ""darkess"" was really good. and system of a down's ""roulette"" was even better. slipknot should have just stopped writing music after iowa. the percussion on this cd is the only good part. i wish i could have given this cd a 0."
4,Decent album with some cool bonuses,I liked it and you probably will too if you are a Slipknot fan. My only advice is wait till the price drops to about 18 dollars. I paid roughly 22 bucks which is 4 dollars too much in my opinion. My logic for this? Lets just say there are only about 18 good tracks and at a dollar a track...well you do the math.
3,"Mature effort, but there is room for improvement","This was Slipknot's third major label release and maybe better than the last 2 because it sounds less nu metal and going more into traditional metal sound. But several things missing are better riffs, better written songs, more musical depth. I believe that this was a good album that showed that Rick Rubin is a great producer, hope fully they grow music wise with every instrument and lyrically because if not it would be a letdown and show that they are not contrary with other numetal bands like Limp and linkin."
5,Different yet awesome!,"I agree when people say it's different. I agree when people say it's not as heavy. But what i disagree with is when people say it's not good. Even though this cd is not as heavy and probably cannot be compared to the older ones, it still shows how good Slipknot is in making music! This cd cannot be described because it is different but still shows what they are really made of!"
3,Bitter-Sweet CD,"OK, well, first things first. This CD is definitely a new direction for Slipknot.I really enjoyed the first 2 CDs, but this one is quite different. They have added acoustic songs, which was a mistake. They certainly have lost that edge that they had 4 years ago.I am not gonna say that you shouldn't buy this album, because I am glad I bought it, 'cause I only paid $15. Every Slipknot fan should buy this, but don't be surprised at the different sound that they have.They still retained a little bit of the awesome sound that they used to have, but they have also decided on going in a new direction, but in my opinion, it is for the worse. I just hope that their next album rectifies this inadequacy.-Sic-X-n-X-the-X-head"
3,Emotionless and Average.,"Slipknot got its fans because it was the musical equivalent of horror films. It was angry, powerful and relentless.This is just music. There's a couple of songs that are alright, but nothing on the level of their first two CD's.I'm not of the camp that thinks a band needs to ""grow"" on every album, or change their sound to show they've grown up. I liked Slipknot because they were different and actually had the anger in their songs and emotional impact in how they played. There's very little emotion in any of the songs on this CD, either anger in the heavy songs or sadness in the slow songs.It's not an awful album, it's just not what I wanted when I bought it. I was excited when I heard it was coming out because there's nobody really like Slipknot, but it seems like all they tried to do with this CD was close that gap and be more like everybody else."
1,PURE GARBAGE!!!!!,"this the one of the worst albums ever. why did they even bother, atleast now they have a reason to brake up. malcore is the genre this belongs too!!!!!if you think this album is pathetic and slipknot should go back to their old sound press ""yes""if you think they should continue on this path to mediocre press ""no"""
1,What Happened?,"Whatever happened to the hard core Slipknot I loved? This album totally blows. I'll break this album down by song.1. Prelude - Sucks.2. Blister Exists - Sucks.3. Three Nil - Sucks.4. Duality - Sucks.5. Opium of the People -Sucks.6. Circle - Sucks.7. Welcome - Sucks.8. Vermilion - Sucks.9. Pulse of the Maggots - Sucks.10. Before I Forget - Sucks.11. Vermilion, Pt. 2 - Sucks.12. Nameless - Sucks.13. Virus of Life - Sucks.14. Danger - Keep Away - Sucks.Slipknot used to be the most hardcore band around, now they write these pop tunes. I would highly reccomend this album to any fan of Kenny G, Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, Backstreet Boys, and the like."
1,Wimpy,This album pales in comparison to Slipknot and Iowa. They sold out and it is too soft and slow for my tastes. Their old stuff was good but this has too much singing and mainstream tendencies. Ill pass. This album made me not like them any more. They went from being a metal band to a softcore metal band that even nonmetal people started getting into. People tell me how great Slipknot is yet they don't know what their old stuff is like. Numetal bands sell out after only a few years. I wish bands these days had more integrity. -Dre
2,What happened to Slipknot?????,This CD is okay. Mediocre at best. It lacks the heaviness of the previous albums. It is better than Iowa. But can't hold a candle to Self-titled. This CD would be better if you remove Duality and Pulse of the Maggots.
4,Slipknot is back with a vengence....but an intelligent one,"Slipknot has definately taken a different turn on this album, but I believe its for the better. I didn't think IOWA was that impressive, as the innovation of their first album seemed to be weighed down by a directionless sludge of anger...and shortly after Slipknot realized this and went on hiatus. With Subliminal Verses, Slipknot have combined the best elements of their first album, taken out some of the heavy sludge of Iowa, and yes...melody too. There is still that aggression that made slipknot famous, but its more intelligent now."
2,ERRRGGG!!!,"WHY? WHY? I was never a HUGE slipknot fan. Who knows, i could've become one, but this album sure as hell didnt help. I own Iowa and think that is a truly remarkable piece of work. Awesome screaming, growling, and singing as well. This? I don't know what to say to this.I've been to numerous Slipknot concerts and have enjoyed jumpingdafukup with them and this cd has ruined that. Duality is an ok song, but alas, the radio has ruined it for me by playing it over and over and over and over again. Opium For The People Before I Forget and mabye Pulse of The Maggots are the only other songs on this Disk that are worth mentioning. Mabye Corey should've stayed with Stone Sour. We'd all be a lot better off. Overall i'm pretty much speechless on how big a piece of trash this album is, which is why i heavn't written much. And sorry to all the Diehard Slipknot fans out there who think this is their best album yet. I completely sympathize. But this is not."
3,Not their greatest work.,"Most people who like this album didn't like their debut or Iowa. Why because slipknot was more heavy on those albums.This isn't slipknots heaviest album. I hope they don't pull a metallica on us and go soft. Now don't get me wrong I love slipknot, but I was dissapointed in this album. Vermillion parts 1 and 2, why would slipknot sing about a girl. Songs that were pretty good that remind me of the old stuff are Before I forget and pulse of the maggots. If you want to hear a good slipknot album than hear their first album. And to mr hann, I agree with you on most of your review but their not rap metal. The only songs that they did something close to that are spit it out and Interloper. Rap metal is more like korn and linkin park, not slipknot. Any way is this is an album I don't regret buying but it isn't what I expected coming from this band."
4,Great Music,this is a great cd. the music is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best tracks on this cd aretracks4. duality5. opium of the people8. vermilion11. vermilion pt. 212. the namelessif you have not listened to this cd before then i recommend you do
5,Slipknot,"Sure it's different from the first two albums, but change isn't always bad, if anything it could be good. This is my personal favorite Slipknot album."
3,Not Iowa,"As others have already said, Subliminal Verses does not live up the the precedent set by Iowa. Iowa pushed the envelope by almost going death metal, while Vol. 3 is more like a heavier Stone Sour. It has grown on me since the initial disappointment wore off, but if you only liked Slipknot because they were almost death metal, you probably aren't going to like this. The one thing that is an improvement is that there are way more guitar leads, possibly owing to Rick Rubin's influence. I can just see him going ""C'mon, let's do a solo, Mick. Use that whammy bar. Do it For Kerry King."" Otherwise the production is kind of thin - think God Hates Us All with less bass on the double bass. I don't hate it but it's not great. Some of the catchy stuff is cool but it's overdone. Iowa is still my favorite."
3,Time to retire the masks boys.......,"Vol. 3 sounds like metal Stone Sour...not like Slipknot. This is a good CD, but a huge disappointment if you were expecting an awesome follow up to Slipknot (self-titled) and Iowa. They are heading in a totally different direction and it definately sounds like they are trying to be very radio friendly with a few tracks on Vol. 3...let the trendy pop BS and ""c""rap stay on the radio, I would rather listen to anything I want on CD anyway. A few of the tracks sound like they are going backwards to the days before their self-titled album (if you've never heard any of their really old songs...i'll just put it this way- these songs have never been released on an album because the album would bomb).Slipknot is one of my favorite bands, but after waiting two years for a killer follow up to Iowa...I end up buying a follow up to the Stone Sour CD."
1,Weak!,This album is weak - sorry to dissapoint the fans...such as myself - who loved the powerful hard energy that the first two albums had....This album is soft. My best analogy if how Limp Bizkit was hella hard and awesome on their first album (3 Dollar Bill Yall) to the weakness of their latest album....Thats all I gotta say..I wanted this CD to pump me up like the older ones. But that didnt happen.This album is definetely not worth the 11 bucks I payed for it...If you want something hard more 'like' the old Slipknot then go buy KORN's 'Take a Look In the Mirror' CD! Thats a f...in awesome CD.
2,Please let this be your last album,"This album is very uninspired. Almost as if they put no time in making it. If they truly do not care about the band anymore then they should just call it quits. I would have liked this album better as Stone Sour, not Slipknot. Once again Rick Rubin takes another great band and tries to commercialize them. Slipknot should not ever put an acoustic song on their albums. Thats not what they are about. There are a few good tracks but they are not as intricate or creative as anything they did on the past two albums. I just hope this is their last album."
3,Not Impressed,"Slipknot's first 3 CD's ""Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat"" ""Slipknot"" & ""Iowa"" were great albums and get the standard of what Slipknot's music is about. I'm not against evolving in the music industry but this album is NOT Slipknot. Don't get me wrote this is a good CD but it doesn't come close to there previous 3 albums. If you are a bigger fan of Slipknot's more melodic material than there heavier material this album is for you, BUT if you like Slipknot for there heavier more edgy material don't buy this album."
5,5 Stars,"This CD is by far in my opinion the best record to date by Slipknot. I was never a huge Slipknot fan, when I first saw them and their creepy masks I was like wtf! But now I would easily call myself a Slipknot fan. I enjoyed many songs from other albums such as Left Behind, Liberate, Spit it Out, Wait and Bleed, etc. Those songs had extreme meaningfull and intelligable lyrics along with non-stop incredible beats. Because of their new CD, I can see the side of Slipknot that I've always thought was amazing. Vol.3 proves Corey can sing without a constant raspy scream(though thats not bad either) and each members talents for their instruments can come together for a perfect mix of rock. I believe Slipknot is the most talented metal musicianists I have ever heard. I love every second of The Subliminal Verses.""All of our questions are answers to our sins.All of our endings are waiting to begin."""
4,"This should have been Album #2, it would have fit better","First off, this is a VERY good album, but this should have been Slipknot's 2nd album since it is alot more reminesciant of the first. They should have let Iowa be the badass 3rd album sendoff if thats to be the case with the band, which I pray it will not.Iowa is my favorite slipknot work, but it is in complete honesty alil to one diminsional, I would compare these two albums to say Pantera's FBD being like Iowa and GSTK being likened to Vol. 3, ones straight on brutal and ones alot more experimental while still being fairly brutal.I really hope this isnt the end of Slipknot because now that they have succsesfully meshed the styles of thier first 2 albums number 4 should be something otherworldly, or maybe underworldly would be a better fit.Cant wait to see these guys KILL the 2nd stage at ozzfest 2004 in the Kountry music capitol Nashville TN!"
2,A little overdone!,"I'm sorry but I just don't like this album! The First two were great, but this one is less than good! One of the reasons is because they tried to add more statements to there music and SLIPKNOT is not about staements. SLIPKNOT is about anger and power taken to it's full extent, and sometimes even further! I think that any fan of SLIPKNOT says this is their best work, is on the wrong page"
1,Crap,"This is possibly the worst Metal Cd in history.....Corey went Hollywood and took Slipknot down.....he simply soldout and wants more money.....Slipknot has their own shoes now...as if they need more money........Slipknot used to be good, but until Vol. 3 came out...then i lost ALL respect for them.....so many people that once said ""OMG, i will NEVER listen to that satan worshipers music"" now own Vol. 3.......f**king hypocrites.."
2,should've been a good stone sour album,"This album really SUCKS! But if it weren't for the songs like SCREAM and the live songs, I should've given this album 1 star. Too commercialized...."
2,"A little hardcore, but slipknot has sold-out definetly","This cd is a disgrace to what used to be a hard-hitting group. With the track ""circle"", which is acoustic just proves they have sold out. THis is not the time to experiment, just do what you've been doing from the past. I went to the concert and they want us to mosh to PULSE OF THE MAGGOTS. SOrry people, if you like this cd, you must have never heard anything before this truely DISASTERPIECE cd. Corey's vocals have lost their touch and so has Joey's drummming. THe worse experimental cd in metal."
1,Slipknot is Music Not,"Sorry, I try to be open minded, but the noise that Slipknot creates cannot be called music. And what's with the stupid masks? Let me guess, their mommies didn't love them enough? It's sad to think how dispossesed and disfunctional someone would have to be to buy into the (...) that is Slipknot. Let's hope that these no talent posers crawl back into their holes before they can unleash Vol 4..."
1,suck suck and more suck....,"it seems to me the only people that like this cd are people w/ little or no taste...ie, people who didnt like previous slipknot cds....which means your some little pansy listening to the new metallica cd like youre all hard...whatever...once a band gets too deep in the record company pockets they are worthless...www.boycott-riaa.com"
4,The Way Metal Should Be.,"This is without a doubt,Slipknot's best album.It has all the ingreadents of a good metal album.The great thing about this album is that it has plenty of good,loud metal songs(ie:Pulse of The Maggots,Duality,and The NaMeLess)but it also features some great acoustic songs(ie.Vermilon PT. 2,and Circle.)which sound just as good as the hard stuff!The best song has to be a tie between The NaMeLess and Pulse of The Maggots.If you buy one Slipknot album,make it this one."
3,1 star for slipknot 3.5 for the CD,"Selling out. Selling out is not a term I like to use, but for me it describes what slipknot did with Vol. 3 to a T. now before you skip my review because you don't agree with it just look at the facts: slipknot goes much more melodic with their third CD, then releases their lightest single to that date. Duality. Slipknot merch. appears like locusts all over hot topic. More middle school kids are wearing their shirts than usual, even the punk kids. Then they release the song Vermillion pt. I can't remember. And do you know what the members of slipknot are doing all this time? filling their swimming pools with money and swimming with Benjamin Franklin. Now I would call that selling out.But other than the whole selling out thing, it is a decent CD. But really you should buy the black dahlia murder, alive or just breathing, or the impossibility of reason first."
2,eehhh not what i expected,"i was a huge slipknot fan intil this came out i didnt like it then i found better bands like rammstein slayer cradle of filth , and i lot others i think slipknot has failed im very disapointed in them"
2,ehhh,"Too much Stone Sour influence. I was dissapointed as soon as I started listening to the first track. I don't like Stone Sour so naturally I don't like the sound of this album. I don't like how Cory sings on this album, the guitar riffs aren't as heavy as in their previous recordings, and what happened to the double bass kicking???? Joey used to kick that double bass out so fast and it sounded so awesome but he doesn't use it that much on this album. I don't know. Too much singing and not enough intensity for me. Some of the songs on this cd actually remind me of Staind and I can't stand that band. Slipknot has definatly done better."
2,Listen before you buy,"I would have not bought this album if I had a chance to (legally) listen to the whole thing first.This album may be good in its own right, perhaps by another band or even as a side project, but I enjoy Slipknot for their style of brutality and this was such a major disappointment. A little change or experimentation is good although this is just too much. Also, the sound production is way overdone (mainstreamed, radio-friendly, or whatever you want to call it) for my taste but this may not bother most people.I would return the CD if it were possible."
1,This is crap...,"Okay so i heard that slipknot had a new album coming out, that should sound way difirent and had its metal roots...Bullsh*t. To be honest, slipknot's vol:3 is worse then nstync,fagstreetboys,feminem,crappy charlotte, and all that pop garbage and the drumming?Weak. For real metal? get the latest album from shadowsfall,children of bodom,pantera,suffocation,cannibal corpse,cryptopsy,morbid angel,skinless, nile,dyingfetus and others. Slipknot is nothing more then a trendy, pop rock group that's following every one and copying every one's mtv music style and heavy or talented? No. Laters !!"
3,The best album of slipknot,"For me this is the best album of Slipknot so far. The two earlier albums is a little bit too hard, brutal and raw for me, they've got too heteful lyrics. This album is still very hard but a hole lot softer the the earlier releases. The album is good but not very good."
3,Er...,"I suppose this is an OKAY album, I gave it less credit than it deserves upon first hearing it.It's quite melodic actually, as it would appear Corey Taylor (vocalist) has fallen inlove with an acoustic guitar.The majority of the songs on Vol. 3, are melody-ridden, and this may displease a few fans of Slipknot, I sure was disappointed to say the least.But if you can see past the extensive melody, you'll actually enjoy this cd.Vermillion and Vermillion II are 2 of the best Slip songs i've ever heard.I reccomend this cd only to loyal fans, otherwise, skip this."
1,When your music sucks this bad...,"I guess you need all the silly adolescent makeup and stupid shenanigans. This band is the silliest, least creative joke I have ever come across. The music is the most mundane, immature crap imaginable. Kids, grow up. It's ok to paint your face like twisted sister and laugh like Beavis and Butthead at death and gore when you're 15, but at some point you need to join the rest of us here in the real world. What's funny is to think about these guys coming home and taking a crap, maybe paying the electric bill and making a T.V. dinner. They're just normal, boring idiots like anyone else. They've just fooled stupid, lonely junior high school kids into buying into their little play time. America: if you will continue to purchase our feces, we will continue to crap it out. Sincerely, Slipknot.Get a life, people."
1,stone sour with mask???,If you are a true fan of slipknot you will buy this cd listen to it then smash the s@#! out of it. There are songs like vermillion that makes nickleback seem like speed metal. When Corey went to do the stone sour album is when it all went bad it split up the band and Corey sang the new slipknot album like a stone sour one there is only two descent songs welcome and pulse of the maggots. The pulse of this maggot is dead this will be in my opion the end of the band way to go Corey!!
1,a new beginning of the end,"at first i didnt like slipknot. now i love there music m.f.k.r,slipknot ,& iowa. im sorry slipknot but i think this cd sucks i do. they had a good thing goin then too much testosterone & ego made them go there own way. big mistatke i think .this is what i think . opinions are lik a$$holes ! every body has 1 & there usually full of $hitVITIATED"
1,The only thing,the only thing that's good about this album is the fact that i can use the hole in the CD for pleasureable purposes.
1,very bad,this cd is by far the worst slipknot cd ever. NOTHING compares to their first 2 cds. Come on now acoustic tracks and Solos!!!. Dont get me wrong now i love slipknot but i am very dissapointed with this cd. If you want to hear some real metal pick up Lamb Of God or the new Killswitch Engage cd. Now they are both true metal bands that can create good quality music by sticking to their guns. This is just my opinion and i felt i needed to say that this cd is crap.
1,Worst Slipknot CD Ever,"Ok I normally like Slipknot, but when I heard this new CD it made me hate them. This has to be their worst CD. Almost all of the songs on the CD sound almost exactly the same and plus they changed their style a bit and they changed it for the worse. I recommened buying their earlier CDs, not this one."
2,I dont understand what happened?,"I bought the self titled debut because i was intregued by the image they portrayed, come to find out they were actually a kickass, inventive band with some true meaning and emotion they were trying to get accross to their face. This is definately the mainstream's influence on slipknot, and i am very disappointed..We need one more album from the roots!"
4,So...where's the real heavy s**t?!?,"Um...so like...is this another Stone Sour CD, or is this really Slipknot?!! If so...WHO TAMED THEM?!! So does this mean that I have to go buy a friggin' Nora Jones CD now or what?!! Now THAT is scary music!!"
4,Showing that they can grow,"I was a little leary with this album at first but I like Slipknot so I figured that I would give it a try b/c it was only $10. I really like it because they are actually expanding. Do not judge this album based on the first single alone, the rest of the album is so much better than Duality. This is still METAL, just not AS hard as they used to be. It is still good.1. Prelude - 2/52. The Blister Exists -3. Three Nil - 4/5 First strong track.4. Duality 3/55. Opium of the People - 3/56. Circle - 4/57. Welcome - 2/58. Vermillion - 3/59. Pulse of the Maggots - 4/510. Before I Forget - 3/511. Vermillion pt. 2 - 4/512. The Nameless - 4/513. The Virus of Life - 3/514. Danger Keep Away - 3/5"
5,Beyond metal,"This cd is genius.only few bands can put acoustic guitars in their songs and make it rock.oh no,let's cry that corey dosen't scream like a madman but like he does in stone sour......the music is still extremely heavy.my personal favorite is ""Before I Forget"".the opening is great.This cd leaked on the internet about 2 weeks ago and i admit that i downloaded it but trust me this cd is much better than the internet versions.this cd is great,and i suggest you buy it.don't always listen to what the critics say about the cd.have your own opinion on it."
2,What is this....,"Ok, if you are expecting anything like the first 2 albums you will be greatly disappointed! This is not the same Slipknot. What I was hoping would not happen has... they have gone mainstream and this album is soft! I have been excited for this album for a while now. Don't get me wrong there are a couple good songs but the majority is not what I expected. Listen to the album first before you buy it. If you do not own IOWA yet buy that instead."
1,lamest cd ever made,even worse than korn its slipnot more dorks with zero musical talent an amputee on guitar and a singer who whines about being grounded by his mom more radio friendly(extreme) music to appeal to little geeks withno fear stickers on thier sears warlock guitar now u better go buy this cd youngman or u wont fit in the dorks who shop the mall and debate if its blackmetal or neon death club
1,come ON this SUCKS,I am indeed a fan of slipknot but this album is the worst one yet.SLipknots debut was Kick A along with Iowa.I just dont find the agression and passion as i loved in the first 2 albums. PLEASE utilize the decal EXPLICIT LIRICS.
1,This album needs an enema!,"This album is pure garbage. Only emo F ags take this music seriously. Corey Gaylord is a spoiled, over produced assclown. Him, and the rest of this 9 piece joke need to retire. And to that brandon weitzel and the person who called him a f ag, you are both f aggots."
2,SOAD Wannabes,"Slipknot have hired System of a Down's producer Rick Rubin in a bid to emulate LA's awesome foursome. Well it ain't gonna work because Slipknot don't have half the talent that SOAD have. Rick, quit fooling around with these no hopers and get to work producing SOAD's new album please."
3,Is this slipknot?,"What happened? With the exception of a couple of songs I thought I had purchased a Stone Sour cd. I don't find anything wrong with Stone Sour. I think Corey has is a man of many talents, but when I buy a Slipknot cd I want it to be Slipknot dammit. I knew right away when I went to grab this album off of the shelf, and I saw that there was no Explicit Lyrics label on it, I knew the band had changed. The band that is supposed to say what they feel has given in to the censors. As a drummer myself I look up to Joey. Although his drumming is intense in this album, nothing could match up to his work in the first two. I gotta say though, I do like the field drum work in track 2. This album had some similarities and differences in comparison with the first two. As far as I'm concerned, the real Slipknot has been slayed by a radio friendly Stoneknot."
1,C-R-A-P That is all this album is,Okay I've hated slipknot since they've come out. The guys are afraid of being big that is why they were the mask. This music is horriable. I dont know why any wants to listen to it. Most of the people who listen to this music are rejects at some high school that one day when they were turned down by all the popular kids instead of saying hey its okay not to be popular but instead there like NO were going to make the most scariest stuff and say you cant join. Come on listen to real music. I listened to metal from were it began. I started listing to Steppenwolf and started listing to Led Zepplen who is the greatist rock band of all time. After I heard LZ I was like can metal get any better and no it couldnt. It went all down hill and it has hit rock bottom and started to dig into the ground at slipknot. Thanks Slipknot for killing metal.
1,Now Put....Your Middle Fingers Away!!!!,The anger set in first. Today I'm still in denial. I'm not sure if acceptance will ever come.
5,Best Metal ALbum of 2004,"I didnt like Slipknot B4, But this is one of my favorite albums ever!!!!!!!11)Prelude3.0 - Hot Song2)The Blister Exists-The Best Song On The Album3)Three Nil-One of the best songs on the cd4)Duality-A great first single off the album and a great song5)Opium of The People-Great Song6)Circle-Not a great song, but still good7)Welcome-Loved the guitars in the song!Fantastic8)Vermilion-2nd best song on the cd.loved it9)Pulse of the Maggots-Fantastic!11 out of 10 stars10)Before I Forget-A fANTASTIC SONG!!11)Vermilion Pt.2-I loved the acoustics and strings in this song! A stellar Part 2 to a all-ready great song!12)The Nameless-loved the drums!! Fantastic song!13)Virus Of Life-A Great Song!14)Danger:Keep Away-Spooky and Haunting! A great end to the CD!"
1,Slipknot = Sellouts,"Slipknot sold out, became commercial, appearing in every metal/rock magazine writing soft songs about their life and x girlfriends. Songs playing on major radio stations. I loved when first slipknot cd came out, that cd blew me away, so aggresive and hard. Second album was bit dissapoing when they tried to do death metal and now this crap. Obviously Slipknot came together to put out lame as cd for some extra money in their pocket.I dooubt SlipKnot will ever come out with a good cd like their self debut album. [...]"
4,Change Can Be for the Better,"First of all, for those of you who are dissapointed with the new sound, you're not really fans if you can't accept experimentation. Personally, I've never been a fan of ""scream-metal""; To me this change in sound is extremly welcomed, sure they are still heavy, but at least Corey sings more and there are more ""melodies"" in the newest release. The biggest surprise of all is that there are two acoustic songs, that was unexpected and I appluad them for trying new things with their music. If all you do is stick to the same mold you are just uncreative. Change/Experimenting is what set's true music away from pre-cut (insert false-music genre here). If you are a Slipknot fan and would like to hear them a little mellower, then deffinatly pick up Vol. 3."
4,Pretty good,"When i first bought this album i was alittle thrown off by how much they've toned down since their debut release but after listening to the cd a few times it really started to grow on me, i like how they show us more of their talents when it comes to guitars and drums. so this cd is almost nothing like the first but in my opinion is still better then iowa. this is a good cd, if ur like 1 of those big hardcore fans that only like the ""old"" slipknot just remember its impossible to recapture or recreate what they once had, i would be personally disappointed if they tried, cause that would just be a desperate attempt to relive what they've already made.but anyway back to this cd, its a great cd with awesome lyrics, crushing guitar riffs, and mind blowing drums, so any self respecting person should buy this album"
4,Evolution,"I got to tell you, I realy apreciate when a band looks at another direction in their career. In this case Slipknot has done a good job with experimenting with new sounds. there are some slow songs on this album, but they're still pretty good. The lyrics are amazing. Good job again. I strongly recomend it..."
4,OMG CHANGE,"HAHAHAHA yeah the cd is a change but they're breaking there limts form the same old stuff they always played. it is a change from one slipknot song sounding like the rest on there cd's... You want ""Aggression and Intensity "" then put in an older cd simple as that."
3,Stone Sour vocals/ Slipknot guitars,"I,ve been reading the reviews and alot of it sounds like stone sour, but it still sound sounds dark and tragic to me. You can still hear the old Slipknot in most of the songs. I like the inserts on the intro of each song it sounds evil or haunting most of the time.Just skip the last song because I think it really is stone sour. Experimental is a good word but it seems they were influenced by the mansion they recorded in or some good pot I don't know. Its differant but slipknot always was weren't they? Lets hear mudvayne or mushroomhead try to copy this. Besides I'll just skip the stone sour like songs or someone will think I'm getting soft.Who am I kidding I'm just as disappointed as all the other metal heads. Slayer never sold out and they still rule."
2,Big dissapointment,"I had been hearing about this album for months. I got home, listened to like 8 songs and couldn't take it anymore. This album was the biggest let-down in the history of music. The only good songs are vermillion and duality. Iowa was the best album. Their self titled album was good too. Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat I didn't like toom much. But I like that better than this album."
3,Slipknot in pop packaging...,"Congrats to Rick Rubin for making Slipknot appeal to 80% of those who currently watch MTV. Slipknot now joins the ranks of Metallica, Eminem, Jessica Simpson, Nelly, Snoop Dogg, etc... Welcome to pre-packaged money making MTV fake generation. Slipknot now sounds like pretty much every other pop rock group out there. Some say they just grew up, yep grew up and developed a taste for bling."
2,Slipknot gone potent,"Its a good way to introduce people into hard rock, but i dont recommend it to real Thrash Metal lovers out their, if your looking for an awesome thrash metal band heres a few recommendations:Slipknot:IowaDevildriver:self titledKittie:SpitPissing Razors:self titled (name sounds punk, its not)Bleeding through:this is love, this is murderousScars Of Tomorrow:rope tied to the triggertestament:the gatheringAmon Amarth:Fate of nornsmany others, check my store, i tried to make it as accurate as posible"
5,New Horizons,"Vol 3 is something new for Slipknot--well not entirely--but harkens to the most melodic tracks of their past, such as Wait and Bleed.The emotion is still there, bleeding out of each track. It's just more focused now. It's no longer a constant yell/thrash/kill vocal tirade. Instead, these tirades are contextualized with other emotions on the spectrum--frustration, love, cynicism, relegation, despair.Some of it is a bit commercialized, granted. Duality and Circle come to mind. They aren't bad tracks, but I'm guessing they were produced with the masses in mind. But the majority of tracks don't suffer from this. Vermilion (parts 1 and 2) and Opium of the People are all outstanding, indicative of Slipknot's best work. Three Nil and The Blister Exists will throw you back to earlier Slipknot, showing that this band still has ""it"" regardless of whether you see ""it"" as classic Slipknot or the newer--more mature in my opinion--Slipknot."
1,Sounds like everything else on the radio...,"What are these kids listining to these days ? I can't for the life of me see whats so appealing about slipknot...Nothing. I mean, these nine guys have nothing to offer you and it sounds like every other band on the radio.I was laying in my room when my 13 year old brother, started playing songs off ""vol 3:(the subliminal verses) "" and i decided to listing to it--Did i like it? No.Was it a waste of time? Yes. I might as well be listining to korn,staind,limp bizkit,mudvayne,killswitch engage,bleedinthrought,atreyu,blink182,good charlotte,Nelly,selltallica,chingy,Britney spears,Justin timberlake and such. I can't even belive slayer agreed to tour with slipknot...What is the world, coming too? Slayer =Sell outs! It wasnt bad enaugh when metallica decided to tour with limp bizkit and linking park and now slayer tour with nu-metal posers too. What a shame. Slipknot has no talent so do not even bother."
1,slipknot sucks,If you are a fan of Iowa and the self titled album DO NOT BUY THE NEW ALBUM! This is slipknot turned into a top forty version of Stone sour. This album is slow and full of ballads. True fans of the old slipknot and heavy metal will hate this album. Slipknot sold out big and this album really sucks. I hope this album finishes the band and Corey can back to writing love songs for Spider-man movies.
2,"Good, but...","For starters, I found that this album got boring with repeated listens. I quite liked it at first, but each time I played the cd, I enjoyed it less and less. No re-listen value. Another reason is a reason that apply's to the band it self: nine guys in jumpsuits and masks? I must say that is kind of lame. And although the music end of this is better than their previous 2, I would've thought that nine members in a band would come up with some great music, since bands such as Exodus and Testament really rip with five members. But, unforuneately things didn't work that way.On the other hand, I find ""duality"" and ""pulse of the maggots""as decent tunes. I don't care 'bout the rest. I don't mean to offend anyone, but spend your hard earned money else-where"
4,you people are idiots,"this album is very good. it dosent blow you brains out every song but to me and a lot of others thats a good thing. There are some really heavy songs and others where Corey does this miraculous thing called ""SINGING"" its truely incredible. Its cool when they go sick but c'mon every song can't be like that. If you have any taste in music you would like this album."
1,Horrible,"This band are so rubbish it is untrue! All they do is make noise, they have no musical talent at all. They try to copy good death bands like Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir and In Flmaes but they arnt even close cos they just havent got a clue. They need to concentrate more on actually playing their instruments, instead of vomiting on the crowd and throwing sh*t around the stage! Hopefully they will split up soon and we wont have to listen to their wannabe nosie much longer.TO THE FANS: get your ears mendedTO GET SOMTHING BETTER :buy any CD in the world that hasnt got SLIPKNOT written on the front!!"
1,eww,"this is poopy. the cover art looks like something that was floating in my toilet yesterday. go buy blink-182, new found glory, good charlotte, yellowcard, and simple plan cd's instead."
3,Well?,"Can you say Stone Sours 2nd album? Some songs rock, some are lame. I thought Rick Rubin was going to bring out the best in them but this is worthless. Very boring. Where is the energy from the first album? Some very mature stuff here but acoustic guitars, come on guys..........."
5,Amazingest Album ever,"well what can i say but WOW! i bought the album the day it cum out and well havent stopped listening 2 it since i loved the previous albums but this something if u own all 3 u have a varied taste now so u should be glad there are melodic tunes on the subliminal verses.i have encouraged 4 ppl so far 2 buy the album so im doing well and these ppl hated slipknot until i played them Circle! my favourite tracks are ""duality"" and ""pulse of the maggots"" and ""circle"" the album is amazing ppl who hated slipknot before now can understand that corey taylor can actually sing and is amazingly talented just as the rest of slipknot truly are cant wait till the next album!"
2,What the hell happened?,"Only four words can describe this: Worst Slipknot Album Ever. If you liked the self titled one and IOWA, this will be a HUGE disappointment. It's like they put no effort at all into this one. Also, you can hear corey's stone sour influence right from the beginning. Oh yeah, forgot to mention there are three acoustic songs in this cd...yep, you heard me right, acoustic songs on a slipknot album. Hard to believe, but true. I'm giving it 2 stars because it does have a few good songs(Duality, Welcome, Pulse Of The Maggots, Before I Forget) but 4 good songs out of 14 is a disaster. I am sure they will lose a bunch of fans as well as gain new ones...from my side, they just lost one."
2,WTF?,"OMG, i thought i just purchased stone sour for a minute there... i expected harder stuff than this. Hell, disturbed had its moments in comparison to this (& thats not saying much)...I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Apology from Road Runner Records,It has been brought to our attention that the album released as: Vol.3(The Subliminal Verses) is in reality a recording of the new work from Stone Sour.-* Road Runner Records is deeply sorry for this Huge Mistake.*-
1,Is this music?,"Do not buy this album.Besides being extremely horrible in the aspect of musicianship, the lyrics are, well hardly understandable , and secondly, even worse then the musicality of this band.I am a musician and a big fan of metal, and Slipknot is noise. If you're into the kind of music that leaves you wondering what you just listened to and if it was in fact music at all, then by all means purchase this CD.If you're looking for a metal band with a creative approach and something original, look elsewhere."
1,Slipknot are one of the many leaders in the generation of poseurs.,"I don't know where to begin. How about Corey and his cohorts are just nine angry teenagers trapped in halloween masks. Every member of this band are just no talent hicks from Iowa. Joey Jordison's drumming is one of the most overrated things on this earth. As many reviewers have also mentioned, their lyrics are s**t. I don't care about satanic themes (I listen to deicide and every other Death or Grind band you can think of), I just care that these no talent poseurs are famous. But, crappy bands usually are famous. Ask about my experience with this music. My conformist, robot classmates love this generic nu-metal. If you want real metal, get nasum, E.T.T.S., or cephalic carnage."
2,Disappointment,"Alright, this is Slipknot's most disappointing album to date. I'm not saying it's bad but it is their most commerical and blah album. Self titled (the 1st major label album) was their best by far in my opinion. Iowa was good but not great, this sounds like they just did it to do it. ""Circle"" (trk. 6) is an acoustic ballad thing, which stops the little momentum the album has and the lyrics of 90% of the album are just not of the ""can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes"" calibur, just not insane enough. The only highlights of this album are Prelude 3.0, the Blister Exists, and Virus of Life. Many skip over tracks on this album."
1,This cd sucks!,"The only reason I gave this cd one star is because you can't go lower! It dosen't deserve any stars at all. Slipknot is a crapy band and their music sucks! Don't buy this cd. Buy something really heavy and brutal, instead. If you buy this cd, you will just end up takeing it outside and hiting it with a baseball bat!"
1,You might have grown out of this...,"If you still love slip-knot-pop-rock, get itIf you are looking at these reviews to decide whether to buy this album, take a second to think about who you would tell if you bought it. If your answer is A: another young teenager, then sure, buy it, get mom worried, dye your hair, get yourself pierced.If your answer is B: your twentysomething or thirtysomething friend (or your carer) then go ahead, buy it. who am i to judge your immaturity.If your answer is C: No-one because you would be too ashamed, then why are you reading this review. you should know better. but then why am i writing it? ok i'll stop"
1,Biggest disappointment ever,"I still remember back in 1999 when I first heard sic. I fell in love with Slipknot. I've been a fan ever since. The self titled and Iowa were two of my favorite cd's ever. I worshiped this band. I even have mate feed kill repeat. Then They took their hiatus and corey started stone sour again and they castrated him. He's lost his charm. I had my hopes up that subliminal verses would be up there with the other releases. after trying and trying to get into these songs, I was let down. This album was majorly pussified. I hate it. there's only three songs on the cd I can stand. blister exists, 3 nill, and pulse. other than those, the rest of the album is crap. alot of posers and wannabes are going to be happy with this album. but true maggots would agree that slipknot owes us true metal fans a much improved volume 4. play something with balls!"
3,good but how i miss their previous form,"ok i realise everyone is different and some say its garbage and some say its fantastic, well thats great, every one is different. HOWEVER i have been a fan since their first album and have always loved all of their stuff, this album came as a great shock, i was initialy thinking ""why have they sent me the wrong cd"" it didnt even sound like slipknot, but sure enough it was slipknot, i have read the comments by other buyers and i have to say there all right, slipknot have always been very tallented and still are BUT if you expect this album to blow your head off like the last ones im sorry to say that aint gonna happen, if u accept this album as music and foget what slipknot used to represent then yes its fantastic. tallented but god im annoyed they dont have that razor edge of thundering power that used to make my hair stand on end and stir my heart ;-("
1,DO NOT BUY,"This CD is horrible. I love Slipknot and have bought all of their CD/DVDs since they've started. This CD sounds like StoneSour with SlipKnot as the band. It sucks. The only good song is ""Pulse of the Maggots."" Wish I could return it."
1,pof,"bauahhhh i hate damn kids who listen to slipknot at school and think there all hardcore with their slipknot patches on their jansport backpacks,i f*cken hate that!!!! and i hatet even more when they actually refear to slipnot as a ""Metal band"" for the love of god get it through your heads retards,SLIPKNOT IS NOT METAL,they never where and probably never while be!! and now that i mentioned METAL if you want some real METAL listen to some real hardcore sh*t like Imolotation or Nercophagist.Stop supporting slipknot and stop being such damn posers!!!"
2,Not as good,"Slipknot is a great overall band. Their first 3 CD's (MFKR, Slipknot, Iowa) were very good, by far Iowa was the best. The new release kinda let me down. It dosnt sound like Slipknot at all, The older Slipknot was alot better recentley their music just sucks. They are becoming to over played and it gets annoying. Some good songs, I like the drum solos but its to original, I give the CD 2 stars"
3,"El mejor disco de Slipknot, pero aún así es aburrido.","El volumen 3 de Slipknot parece cumplir las expectativas de todos los maggots alrededor del mundo, pero a mí que me gusta el verdadero metal resulta un tanto aburrido y repetitivo.Aún así el disco esta plagado de atronadoras rolas que resultan cañonazos al oído, aunque esta sería la perfecta oportunidad de los Slipknot para lanzar una obra maestra, aunque se queda muy lejos de ello."
5,Future Kings of Metal!!,"If you want a true example of how a band should grow and progress, this album is it!! Des Moines' favorite sons are back with their best album to date!! Check it out, and I'll see ya at Ozzfest!!"
4,Wow!!!,"When I listened to this album, I had to slap myself to believe it was Slipknot playing. It's amazing! They have really moved on musically. Iowa and Slipknot were both a bit... too destructive and inexplicable! This album has elements of the shouty and self-destructive Slipknot we used to know, but with new sounds added in as well. The fact that there are three songs that have accoustic guitars and at least nine that have understandable lyrics. It shows a massive improvement, and for the people who think Slipknot just shout and scream and swear, this is an album that will prove them wrong. I hope that this is sign of many brilliant things to come from Slipknot. They are trying to find their individual ""sound"" and to be honest, I think they've found it. Well done! Like the news mask as well! :)"
3,3 stars for a good try,"when slipknot's self titled album came out it rocked. when iowa came out it continued slipknot's tradition of extreme heavy metal beats and harsh lyrics. then this crap comes out. weak drums, merely ok guitar, and corey doesn't even sound the same. there are only a few good songs on this album including blister exists and duality. almost all other 13 songs are garbage. what a let down. slipknot please redeem yourselves by making another ""Iowa"" type album. you cant even jam to this in concert!"
5,I just don't understand how some people can be so stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,How can people say this sucks!!! It is awsome!!!! OH yeah they are not satanic freaks!!!! DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE INSANE PEOPLE WHO SAID IT SUCKED BECAUSE IT REALLY DIDN'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Who cares about a Parental Advisory,"Most people are asking where's the parental advisory... I'm asking where's the music. This album is a let down. Corey mumbles to much, the hardcore music isn't there. Just a let down all over."
1,What an amazing waste of time!,"I've heard only three songs off this album and dont want to listen to anymore. They play their songs on my local rock station..... thats sad. All I hear from my friend is that this album is so great and that it is so different. It sounds to me like they are trying to HARD to be DIFFERENT. I dont even care that they wear masks their music sucks a**, and have you seen corey w/o the mask please keep it on."
2,2.5 stars,"Only for the song pulse of the maggots does this album get 2.5 stars that song alone brings this album up. I like metal along with other genres of music. Variety is the spice of life but these guys only pull it together for 3 or 4 songs on each album. If I took all 3 of their albums and could pick and choose songs I could put together a decent album but alot of tracks are filler or just don't really vibe for me. MUDVAYNE,is a much better overall band with alot more talent within the nu-metal genre."
5,"Different, Takes Alot Of Getting Used To","I will admit, I'm a die-hard maggot, and when I bought this CD first day and gave it a listen, I was thinking sell-outs. I slowly liked it more and more, and when I saw them at Ozzfest I realized they definitely did NOT sell-out. They were more brutal than ever, and Corey's voice was way better than on Vol.3. It sounded more like old Slipknot, which made it more enjoyable for me. But I have finally accepted the new Slipknot and truely realized what an awesome piece of music Vol.3 is. The whole CD is the highlight, whenever I listen to it I go all the way through, no skipping tracks. I have a feeling the next CD will be better though. So get it if you like Slipknot, don't get it if you don't."
3,Not like The last 2,"Wow! Is this even the same band, I dont even know how the whole band had contribution in this cd. theres hardly any mixing in it no 3 drummmers at the same time pounding away, I think there making a solid attempt for mainstream, its not working. the cd's alright, I bought Cuz im a big follower, but its not what you'd expect from slipknot, I would however recommend the new machine head though."
4,Metal Gods,This Cd is a great metal cd probably their best. Every song is great. it's a little different than the other 2 but change is good.
4,hmmm....,"people, quit complaining. if u dont like it, there's many other people to like this record. hmm.. 4 1/2 star..."
2,Worst slipknot ever,"When i first bought this cd i assumed that it would be something like the song duality and pulse of the maggots from hearing them. This cd has some of the worst songs yet with the exeption of a few, duality was the best one on there. So if you didnt like that song dont expect anything from this cd. The vocals sounded like hanson was in on some of them. I think that slipknot is heading more towards a nickelback sound. If you want to hear a great slipknot cd go out and get the self titled one.Another problem that i had with this cd was that the tracks that actually sounded like metal had no personality and edge like slipknot is known for."
4,Great Album,"I haven't been much of a slipknot fan... I mean yeah I liked maybe 1 or 2 of their songs before this came out. I didnt care for them that much because all their stuff started sounding the same. But this album blew me away. Normally their screaming just goes on and on, but in this case they sing really well and still have the screaming in there and it works. The guitar and bass is just awsome and the drums are unbeleivable. What really suprised me is that there are acustic songs on here...and they kick ass. So the bottom line is if you like slipknot buy this album... it still has their old stuff, along with some welcome new stuff. And if you dont like Slipknot, buy this album anyway because you'll like it even though it is Slipknot. this album is also good for when your pissed off at the world,in violent fast mood, just wanna chill out, or if you just wanna pound your head in with some music."
4,Vol3,This was an awesome CD although many songs did not live up to my expectations from IOWA. I think if this would have been released before IOWA then it would be much better. I dont think anything could top IOWA. Overall i give this Cd a 4 out of 5 stars
4,Not given enough credit,"This C.D. is good. It may be different from their other 3 C.D.'s. (yes three), but I respect their change. I don't think anyone is giving them enough credit. I hope this C.D. will grow on people as it has on me."
1,Complete horse$h!t,"Listen, their self titled, and iowa were good by nu-metal standards, that's right, I said it, nu-metal, listen to real f'n metal, like hatebreed, chimaira, as i lay dying, I'm not even talking death metal, just good metal, compared to these, this is complete $h!t. This band should have just quit trying when Stone Sour came out, cuz that's what this album is, the follow up to Stone Sour's s/t. I wish I could give it a zero."
2,what are you guys smoking?,"I'm really surprised at the reviews of this record. This band was great, original and heavy as hell. Vol. 3 sounds like Stone sour, MurderDolls, and a little bit of Slipknot thrown in for good measure. By the time i get done listening it sounds like ""contractual obligation"" should of been the title. These guys are capable of fAST SPEEDY rhythms but it all sounds slowed down and melodic. They already have to 'mature' by the 3rd album? I say go buy the new Dillenger Escape Plan instead."
3,"A kinder, gentler Slipknot......","1st off the 1st CD was great, 2nd cd was good (it had it's great moments though) and this new cd is ok. Seems like they have digressed to me over the years. Corey doesnt sing (scream) with conviction like before. I guess all that screaming can take it's tolll on you after a while! But much like IOWA, this new cd has it's shining moments, just not enough for me to put it in the same catagory as the 1st release."
2,Heaviest band on the planet?????,Give me a break! This album is way too soft and mainstream. I thought I was listen to creed or nickelback...I'm not a REAL matel fan think they're not metal so hate them. They have some songs are ok and you can enjoy it. But come on! this album is like made for MTV.
1,sellouts,"Once I found out Slipknot was comming out with a new album, I was exstatic! I LOVED their self titled cd and Iowa was pretty good. Once I bought Vol 3 (with out listening to it first, stupid me)I hated it! The guitar riffs are horrible and repeatative and over powers the drums on alot of songs. Cory doesnt do his aggressional scream anymore, and the lyrics are so over the top. They totally sold out to the MTV generation and it can only keep going downhill from this. I cant stand Slipknot now and have lost all respect for them. Whoever said Slipknot was death metal obviously doesnt know what theyre talking about! SLIPKNOT IS NU-METAL...NOT DEATH METAL! If you want to listen to real death metal, i recommend Mayhem, Gorgoroth, Anorexia Nervosa, Murduk, Cryptopsy and etc."
2,WHERE IS THE VIOLENCE ??? WHERE IS SLIPKNOT DAMMIT !!!!!!!!!,I'm gonna just say this.....vol.3 = very very....suck
1,This is not metal,"I used to think bands like Korn, Slipknot, Limp Bizkix, who ever else that was on MTV, and on the radio were real metal bands. Then I picked up a CD called Escape by a band called Ram-Zet. To my shock I heard something that was far more heavy then Slipknot, Adaem, Korn, etc. I started to find more and more metal bands that well big over on the other side of the Atlantic coudl not be found over here.Then I found out way. It was because if some radio DJ tried to play a real metal band like Ram-Zet they would be fried for it. All because teenagers were not buying it.Guys really a band dose not need nine people to make a band. Six to five people are just fine. Swearing does not make you a metal band. There are some that swear. But many of them do not. They add in things from new music, to old music, every thing. Metal music is far deeper then what you will find on a Slipknot CD."
2,Utter Crap!!,"There is no way this is better than the old Slipknot- and even then they still held a bit of unwillingness to listen to in my judgement. anyone who said that this album was good is either deaf, hasn't heard anything off the prvious slipknot albums or just needs to be shot....twice. Granted, there are one or two good songs on the album, but I still preffer the old Slipknot- it was more metal than this crap and was way more worthy of a headbang and a good screaming to. To all who have not heard the old stuff, go pick it up- to all who have.....go play in traffic."
2,"good heavy metal, bad music","a lot of people think this cd is very creative, artistic, and shows great musicianship. Heavymetal music however is primarily easy music. it is made this way so non-musicians can enjoy music w/o becoming overwelmed with sophisticated musical ideas. as far as heavy metal goes, it's not bad. But true music, at its best, is not found here."
2,slipknot or stone sour??!?!?!?!?!?!,"i agree with most of these posts...it seems as though slipknot has forgotten why they have such a strong fanbase and tried to change their sound...i heard that this was going to be the hardest album yet but that couldn't be farther from the truth...many of the songs sound very ""stone-sour-ish""...and this is their last cd?!?!...i've heard that it's better to burn than fade away and this cd is definitely fading away from my cd collection..."
1,HAHAHA!!!!!,"This CD makes me laugh. This is some of the worst music i've ever heard. When I heard Duality, I was sure that this CD would fail. Let's see how much this CD sucks:Lyrics: Generic ""I hate my mommy"" garbage.Vocals: I've heard dying cats sing better.Guitars: Power chord heaven, with 1 half-assed, out of place solo in 1 song to cover up the lack of talentBass: I wasn't aware of any bass whatsoeverDrums: OVERRATEDDJ: DJ!? Don't make me laugh!Samples: Stupid pinhead. Jordan Rudess of Dream Theater could kill this guy.Percussion: Their idea of percussion is 2 guys smashing things with baseball bats.Stupid CD from a dumbass band. Slayer & Dream Theater could kill these guys.To the guy who said he's making me think twice, not really. Slipknot is still false metal."
1,Nu Metal=Talentless genre from the start,"I Thought rap was bad, this nu metal genre is even worse, slipknot along with 98% percent of the nu metal scene is what's everything wrong with music these days (ever since that braindead shotgun drug addict kurt nobrain ruined rock), this cd is a waste of my time and everybody else time.this album is a nilhilistic, insulting, mean-spirited, disgusting and reprehensible geek show.and one person said that Slipknut is better than kiss, how can you even compare those losers to a great band that sold 80 million copies and made better music and have better makeup than these losersthat's like comparing that godawful tony yayo to wyclef jean.This is by far the worst genre of the decade, it's worse than paper.Even 80's hair metal beats this anyday of the week.Thank God I'm a independent voter."
5,Normal person,"I don't know how many people will read this since it has been 5 years(after release) but I felt I had to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of the BEST CDs of all time. I have never written a review on here before so know that this is not an emply compliment. I was a casual Slipknot fan before this cd. I liked a few of their older songs but didn't really get it. On a whim I bought this right when it came out not knowing what to expect. I still listen to this cd often to this day and have seen them in concert and purchased the older cds and have grown to appreciate the sound on all albums. This one is a little ""softer"" than others but still kicks a$$. In a perfect world the new cd will be a mix of this one and Iowa."
2,Don't Bother,"If you want the vinyl pressing as a collectable, then go right ahead. If you want better sound than the horribly compressed CD mastering, prepare for disappointment. They simply used the CD for the vinyl master. Sounds awful."
2,where is the parental advisory label?,"After the insanely brutal first album and the twisted glory of Iowa, Slipknot return with what is arguably one of my biggest disappointments in recent years. There are bands where you expect them to swear and be twisted and while there are decent anger songs on this album, there is also far too much pure singing:( Also, there is absolutely no swearing, with the exception of a few damns...whoopee! c'mon Corey- i wanted the next ""f"" it all,""f"" this world, ""f"" everything that you stand for...there are some good, catchy songs on this album that you will want to listen over to again but, Slipknot are supposed to be angry, swearing nutcases-and don't give me the reinvention stuff- because although that definately worked for Korn:), Slipknot is (was) definately more heavy then them..."
2,Slipsour?,"Ok, don't get me wrong, I love acoustic music, but I never in a million years expected not one but two acoustic tracks on a slipknot record. It just ruins everything. Slipknot was supposed to be about brutality... music to work out to, to play basketball, something physical. It was about pure agression in the beginning. Now the line between Stone Sour and Slipknot has faded into nothing.I'm not saying it's not worth your money, or that it's a bad CD because it's not. Musically they are tighter than they've ever been.For people who enjoy Stone Sour more than Slipknot, this is your disc. For true Slipknot fans who worship the first album, this will be your own personal hell."
2,I hate it.,"I listened to it and don't like it. Buy king of all kings by Hate Eternal. With only three members they remain heavier than slipknot. Every song has a solo, they are noisier, the drumming is faster, the vocals are better, and the bass guitar is really heavy."
1,what is so scary about 9 clowns ?,"slipknot suck. they are not death metal they are circus metal.only little supit 12 year old kids think that slipknot are ture black metal. If slipknot is black metal why is there a a clown, gas mask guy, pinnocuo,and a bunch of halloween kids.why is there a damn DJ? if you want real cold dark black metal check out band like mayhem darkthrone immortal dark funeral enslaved and bathory not kids music."
1,Stink with Stone Sour please!,"Alright, i gave this one a couple of ""listens"", and to tell you the truth....it made me want to go to Hot Topic and wear all black. Too bad i snapped out of it, i was lulled in by this cd's repativeness, repeating crappyness. I can't believe people refer to this ""band"" as metal, they arn't metal, shock/heavy/rap/rock/crap...their own genre just for them."
2,The Black Album,"Yes, this is yet another pairing of a heavy band and a ""mainstream"" producer gone bad (ok, not totally mainstream but Rick Rubin did produce Johnny Cash and LL Cool J). If you like Beatles harmony vocals, Acoustic guitars and mixes with less low end than a Toyota commercial then this is for you. There is a record lying underneath all the junk here so if you're a Slipknot fan like me then buy it and put it in your audio editing program, crank up the lows and cut out all the tunes that reak of over production and burn a new cd. I sure hope they come back with Volume 4 and someone like Terry Date producing."
4,Not Slipknot but still good.,"I had been waiting for what seemed like forever after Iowa for this CD to come out. So I finally bought it the day it came out on May 25th. I can't say that I was disappointed, but this sounds closer to a heavier Stone Sour than Slipknot. I like it a little better than Stone Sour. I like it about the same as Iowa. Iowa was good, but nowhere near the major label debut. Don't get me wrong, this is a step in the opposite direction that Iowa was. This is nothing like anything Slipknot has ever done. I bet they will lose at least half of their fans over this, but I don't regret buying this. I do like this cd, and I do like Slipknot; I was just kind of surprised because I saw them live a month ago and did not hear anything like this. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Slipknot or especially Stone Sour, as long as they are open-minded and realize that Slipknot have indeed changed. Duality is a great song by the way (I know I will catch hell for saying that)."
2,You can't take my $14.99 away from me!!!,"Where is the Aggression? Where is the Intensity? I listen to alot of different ""styles"" of music, hell i even listen to orchestras. Which ""style"" i listen to depends on the mood I'm in at the time. Slipknot used to be the ""get the F up and go"" type. Now I wish that THEY would get the F up and go, please!!! Besides the 4 or 5 parts of some songs, where sould i bang my head to this? I'm always a firm believer that if any band changes their style, they too should change their name.I'M GLAD I KEPT MY RECIEPT."
2,Frustrated,"I reviewed this album earlier and the more I listen it has parts that I like and then parts that I hate and am embarassed for them. What is this pretty singing crap about love and stuff, how can you go from ""if your 555 I'm 666"" to your more than I ever wanted love song crap. I think they forgot they are wearing scary masks.I may just burn it and then trade it in on something better,hell there are christian metal bands that are harder than this, try Soul Embraced. They used to be SIC now I think I am sick of them. Biggest disappointment since Damageplan. What is wrong with all these used to be thrashers. this has to be a joke. I hope they read these reviews and wake the f**k up."
2,Spilknots Worst,Something about this CD feels like they just recorded it to make a quick buck. It doesn't seem to have the feeling and dedication as the previous 2. I really wanted this album to be good. I was very much let down. The songs obviously were thrown together-like the band was forced to make this album under duress.
1,"""confused teen""","I listen to this album while I slit my wrists or cry my self to sleep. My favourite song is circle; volume 3 is hard-core death metal masterpiece!! The best songs are prelude 3.0, circle, danger-keep away, and vermillion part 2. If I could give it 10 stars I would!! But its the worst album i've heard!!!"
2,Dont get me started...,I am not going to say a word about how bad I thought this alubum sucked...But I gave it a 2 cause I like what Slipknot is going for. There trying to show people that music is not about looks and they have a taleted Drumemr but I am not gonna say a word more about them.
5,A change for Slipknot,"Slipknot's other albums were hardcore to say the least. I thought they were pretty good, but this new piece of work tops it. Subliminal Verses show Slipknot with a new type of voice. Slipknot is not afraid to slow it down. I respect that.The songs that really stick out ARE:DualityCirclePusle of the MaggotsVermillionVermillion Pt.2The Virus of LifeThe NamelessDanger - Keep Away"
5,A big surprise,"The first time i heard Duality, i was going i hate this...i hate this...slipknot sucks..but then i found myself listening to the song whenever it came on. soon, i baughtt he album, and listened to it. At first, i wasnt too impresssed, until i started to listen to it more...about the fourth time, it came to the conclusion that it ruled. you dont need to yell and screwm all the time to make a good metal band, and corey preoves it with his balanced voice. some say hes gone soft, but even when he is singing, its not exactly what i would call nice lyrics, still dark at the center. granted, its no where near the same as Iowa, but to be honest, i wouldnt want another cd thats the exact same. overal, kicked ass"
5,YES!!!,This album is AMAZING!!!!!! The songs are AWESOME. I agree with everyone who rated this cd positivly. its so so so so so so good. you have to buy it. RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
4,It's getting better and better,"I'd have to say this is their best album from all three. The self-titled album was OK. Iowa was really good and now Vol.3:(The Subliminal Verses) is the best one they've come out with. I'd say if it wasn't for this album I wouldn't like them as much as I do now. Yes, it's different from their old stuff but people do change. It is possible that they don't feel like screaming and growling every song they do. Overall, I say this is a very good album and can't wait for them to come out with a new one."
4,The new and improved,"First off I would like to mention that I have followed slipknot since the beginning and I believe that this album is better than their second. I think that the band has matured into something original and creative. The only thing that is dissapointing is the acoustic tracks. Even though I like them I dont think that those songs fit with a band like slipknot. Otherwise they dont disappoint with their metal songs. Three Nil is like their best song period that beginning riff is hard core. Another thing which is cool about this album is that it was produced by Rick Rubin, who has been in the game awhile. I am a maggot for life all you haters can shut up."
1,English Coins: From the Seventh Century to the Present Day,"If you're purchasing this book to price your coins--don't. All coin photos (black and white) are in the back of the book. You then have to page through to find the reference number that corresponds to it; which brings you to some useless information. Finally, you'll resort to the index (between useless information and photo's) in hopes that it might shed some light on...anything. It's doesn't. This book is poorly put together. I reluctantly give it a star."
2,Film with Abusive Cops,What is new about this film? Just a bunch of abusive cops bulling the slave class (the American people). Videos like this only are used to condition the population to accept police brutality.
5,Beautiful music!,"The music from ""Home on the Range"" was much more than I expected! I loved the songs, especially the ones sung by kd lang and Tim McGraw.Kd lang's voice is so beautiful and lilting in ""Little Patch of Heaven,"" and it fits extremely well with the feel of this film. McGraw also does a great job with his sensitive performance of ""Wherever the Trail May Lead,"" played during the film's credits.Alan Menken deserves a lot of credit for this creative and funny soundtrack. Even though this movie was overlooked and not incredibly popular at the box office, the music deserves some awards! I loved the movie and the music."
5,I love this CD.,"The story was about three cows trying to stop a rustler from stealing the herd and making them lose their farm. The music is very old western style and a lot of fun to listne to. I put it on my Iphone for fun. The Cow Wrestler sings a yodeling song that is really fun and well done. When I am crabby or waiting in the dentist's office I put this on to raise my spirits, and it works. It's just good old western style fun."
2,"Decent book, less appealing information","Most of the book was very helpful to get my young niece to understand the care of the dwarf hamsters, but I had to correct a few things for her, for instance, they suggest pine or cedar bedding for them, although they do mention that cedar MIGHT not be the best choice, either of these materials are extreemly inappropriate for any small animal, bird, or reptile. They also suggest giving daily fruit treats, I have to disagree, while this is fine for syrians (goldens, etc...), dwarf hamsters are much more likely to develop diabeties, so PLEASE watch the sugar intake, even of natural sugars like fruit."
2,NOT for dwarf hamsters,"Do not buy this if you own a dwarf hamster.. the info. does not pertain to them.Never use cedar bedding or products for your dwarf, it can make them very sick or worse...Dwarf hamsters need to avoid too much sugar as well.. they can develop diabetes!!They also have very sensitive respiratory systems, so NO dusty bedding."
5,"a beautiful, disturbing, thought provoking book","simon wiesenthal is a brilliant, haunted writer who conveys chillingly the perceived moral dilemma he faced as a dying SS officer begged him for forgiveness for his crimes againt the jewish people during the second world war. while it seems obvious to this reader that the proper response would have been a prompt ""rot in hell"", it does give more than enough food for thought to anyone who realizes the enormity of the holocaust's unpleasant moral implications for all philosophers and sociologists who endeavor to know the actual nature of man as opposed to wishful thinking a la rousseau or kant. wiesenthal's accomplishments and inspiring life's work (much like frankl's) since his horrendous experience as one of the many victims of this unbelievable historical atrocity gives hope to all students of the human condition even in the shadow of auschwitz and unspeakable evil. a treasure of a book."
4,Forgiveness,This was a great book. It was a very short and fast read. It made me want to read Simon's entire biography. This version includes Simon's story. Then the second half or the book is a symposium. So there are short commentaries from various persons.
4,"Thought provoking, troubling, facinating!",Sunflower has been on my bucket list for years. I am glad I have read it. The depictions hang in the back of your mind almost as a haunting. The answers to the authors final question by various respondants are worth the effort it takes to read them-even if you disagree with their opinions.
4,A story about how a Jew's decision never leaves his mind.,"The Sunflower, by Simon Wiesenthal, is a story showing that tough decisions can't be made from only a moment's thought. It also brought up the question of whether or not someone has the right to forgive the misdoer of another victim. I would definetly rate it a four, because this book never left my hands. It was a true pageturner."
5,Jew in the Holocaust asked for forgivness by a dying Nazi,"Weisenthal, a Jew in a concentration camp in the Holocaust, is pulled out of work one day to listen to the confession of a dying SS man. The Nazi is truly repentant of his horrendous sins, and asks Weisenthal for forgivness. Even after Weisenthal makes his decision as to what to say, he spends the rest of his life wondering if he made the right choice. This book addresses such important questions as ""can one man grant forgivness for another?"" and ""do even the Nazis deserve second chances?"" Most importantly, Weisenthal (the writer of the true story) asks the reader ""what would you have done?"" This is the type of book that holds you in a horrified fascination so that you can't get it out of your hands until you've finished it, and you can't get it out of your mind until long after. *Everybody* should read this book."
5,Asks all the right questions...,"I stumbled on The Sunflower a couple of years ago, and as soon as I read it, I knew I had to use it in my theological foundations class, which I have now done for the past few semesters. Without fail, students have been absolutely blown away by it - they regularly list it as their single favorite aspect of the class. The story does not let the reader off the hook easily - ""What would you have done?"" is only one of a dozen impossible questions the book puts before the reader. Considering the meaning of the idea of God being ""on leave"" and leaving behind no deputy, asking not only whether one should forgive but if one CAN forgive in such a situation, wondering what Karl's story says about the potential of humanity for evil and for redemption - this book is truly a jewel, with any number of brilliant facets and possible modes of interpretation."
5,What would be the reply of a protestant?,"This is an excellent and provocative book. I recommend it without reservation. I am surprised, however, that there are no responses from mainline protestant clergy and only one or two from protestant leaders in Christian theology. There are numerous responses from Catholic priests, bishops, and theologians, but no protestant clergy. (There is one Episcopalian -- a converted Catholic priest!) The Catholic responses generally, in my view, follow a similar argument and reach a unified conclusion. But the concept of repentance and forgiveness (especially via the authority of clergy or the church) is very different between Catholic and reform theologies. It is a shame that the Christian responses are generally limited to the Catholic Church."
1,awful,Don't waste your time watching this film. It's so horrible. You should win a prize if you can actually watch the whole thing. The acting is bad. No plot. Every thing is just horrible.
2,The Hillz,"Not great, watchable but lets face it, Paris ain't too much of an actress but lets let her believe that she is... for now (she's unstopable for the time being). I put the movie on at 10:30pm but couldn't stay awake to watch the end. It's not engaging with the viewer and the ""drama"" doesn't keep you on edge thinking what's going to happen next? Not for people taking a chance on a movie, but for Paris Hilton devotees ONLY! Paris should stick to what ever it is that she does best, but it definetly ain't acting. God save us from the album so busily recording!"
1,Ewww,"There's really not much to say about this movie except that it sucks. The acting is so bad it takes away from anything you can say postive about it. Paris Hilton is suppose to be the ""hot chick"" in this but she looks downright terrible. Who wears a dress like that to a furneral? Everything about this movie is laughable."
2,What a waste of film and my time!,"I just wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching this useless drivel. Poor acting, plot, etc. If you like this genre, do yourself a favor and see 'Alpha Dog' instead- it's hot and this is not."
3,Paris is fine as fukc,"THE HILLZ producers say it's all about drug addiction, sex and violence but they should have taken it further. More creative violence that moves the plot forward in a logical way. It's not that hard when you get a writer who knows how to write. Paris is adorable as always and the only reason to see the film.These other reviewers were obviously hired as gimps or gaffes during the production. The producers should have hired me to write the script and it would have hit theaters instead of straight to DVD. Script writers in Hollywood are retarded and/or scared to do even a single thing that's surprising.This film isn't KIDS, but it does have Paris. Who is did I say it earlier -- fine as fukc. She needs me to write her a script, I'll make her into the film star she deserves to be since she's way finer than Tara Reid and all these other girls who can't even touch Paris."
1,"Terrible acting, terrible quality, very unbelievable...","I only rented this movie because Paris Hilton was on the cover. Little did I know it isn't about her at all...and she's only in about 10 minutes of it. The film quality is terrible and it really looks like someone went outside with a home video camera and taped it. On top of that, the acting is very bad. The actors show no emotion at all. And...the events are completly unbelievable. These rich kids just go around killing people for stupid reasons (like someone owes them $80) and they never get caught. On top of all that, whoever edited the movie put little stupid effects like a twinkle on this one rich guy's tooth when he smiled. Everything about this movie was dumb. I really think anyone could go out, buy a video camera and some cheap editing program, and make a movie better than this. If it didn't have Paris Hilton...it would have NOTHING going for it."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It is so bad that it was hilarious. I haven't laughed so hard in a movie in a long time. The acting, script and editing are all awful. Every scene in the movie had nothing to do with anything. Anytime anyone said anything, it had nothing to do with anything that was going on in the movie. Horrible."
1,HORRIBLE,This is the worst movie that I have ever seen!! Paris Hilton sucks as a actress. I fell asleep 4 times during the movie and couldn't wait for it to end. Don't waste your money buying it.
1,HORRIBLE,This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. Horrible acting ever one is trying to be a gangster key word is trying.
1,The worst movie I've ever encountered,"There aren't words sufficient to express just how piss-poor this movie is. The writing is a disaster, the acting is so bad it makes the viewer visibly uncomfortable, and the production quality is about as low-budget as it gets.The only thing working for this movie is just how bad it is. I was flipping around last night and caught it coming on Showtime. Out of curiosity, I decided to watch the first few minutes and, before I knew it, I was completely mesmerized by how utterly terrible this movie was in every possible respect. I mean, if the movie had been just bad--as opposed to an absolute train wreck--I certainly would've stopped watching it. But this movie was so mindblowingly terrible that I simply couldn't turn away.So it has that going for it. Which is nice."
3,its a bigg help if you teach your self,"the cds are great i gave it 3 stars becuase i ordered two of them from amazon and both of them had 2 disc two's instead of disc 1 and disc 2 i had to order from melbays web site to get the right cds other then that this would have gotten 5 stars the cd helps alot with the feel of the song being played and ther are alot of really cool sounding songs exp: wade in the water, the hope, the happy farmer the list goes on. i fully recamend this cd for those self teach players?"
4,"Not very deep, but a fun read","It may not be the most profound book out there, but it's a good light read. The only thing that bothered me was that I didn't feel that elves and Sumerian demons really fit together. The cultural backgrounds are too different. It would have seemed more harmonious if Ilaron had been more along the lines of Gilgamesh."
2,"Acceptable, but not very polished and sophisticated.","As with every book I've read published by Roc, ""Son of Darkness"" is forthright and simplistic. Josepha Sherman weaves togeather good basic story elements, but misses the depth and development of details and character that make a good fantasy novel convincing. There are some excellent and imaginative touches, such as the relationship between magic and electrical energy, but overall it was disappointing."
3,Army Times,"Army Times is a must for an soldier who plan to stay in the army.Gives you much needed up to date info. Pay scales, cut-off scores, changes in the army rules and reg. And just current news from around the world about the army. Served for 8 years including 6 month combat. Been out since 1997 but want to order home dilvery!"
2,Boring,"I love Judy Holliday movies. She has always intrigued me because she played bubble headed characters, while in real life being an extremly intelilgent woman whose life was cut short by breast cancer. Thought this book would shed some light on her life, which it did, but in a dragged out way. I think the author was trying to fill pages."
3,Subject over Style,"No one I know has ever praised the Marquis de Sade's unique style, so I didn't expect a pile of prose outlining a beautiful love story which just happens to involve a father and daughter. If you wish to read this book, it's best to go in with an open mind and an idea of the subject. This book explores the ideas behind incest and what it does to corrupt the parties involved. Be prepared for deep thought and disgust.The story moves quickly, making it easy to read. The dialogue is interesting, and the characters believable, at least until the end. I'm no fan of ""deus ex machina,"" and this is no exception. Belief is suspended when the villain of the book suddenly decides he's done enough harm to his family and the story ends.For a cultural experience, an excellent read. As a life-enriching novel, easily skipped. Read a crime-drama novel instead."
2,DeSade is Overrated,"DeSade never actually describes any of the sex acts which I found disappointing. Maybe what were are exposed to today, regarding sex, it wasen't that shocking. I think a lot of people forget that DeSade was from the upper class and never worked a day in his life. So he felt he could look down on the lower class and woman and tell everyone what was wrong with them. Also, from reading his books that he has a deep hatred for woman and men, which I suppose stems from his mother leaving him with his perverted uncle who allegedly molested him when he was a young boy. I expected more."
2,Who takes an oven camping?,"When I go camping I don't take my oven with me, but this writer does. To many recipes call for cooking the dishes in an oven. I was looking for something a little more rustic, like the Dutch Oven."
1,Nutmeg Recipes for the Avid But Hungry Camper,"We found this book useless for camping purposes. It is NOT practical, especially for the avid camper, to have access to an oven nor a teaspoon of ""Kitchen Bouquet"" (pg. 85). As with all camping chores, simple is best, and this book falls far short of simple. Many of these recipes are just too elaborate and are more appropriate for indoor cooking. We will be sticking to our foil wraps."
5,Cool product,"Motorolla SLVR L7 is a nice cell phone. Slim, many funtionalities like MP3 player, digital organizer, alarm clock, video, photo camera and more. It also has a blue tooth to transfer data to and from a computer. But I wonder why there is no auto redial feature incorporated in it to help when call fails. Other than this, I like it very much."
2,Not complete; unclear,"This is an incomplete pronunciation book. It does not include all of the plays. You don't know this until you get it home. Also, it's difficult to follow the author's respelling of words. The pronunciation guide is unclear. Does not include some of the words that I looked up."
5,Sublime...,"The soul of this man is beautiful. I've never him but to do so would be a spiritual pleasure because his melodic phrasing is just that tantalizingly good. I can't sum it up any other way, Ronnie should be teaching at Harvard!"
5,Finally!!!,"Thank you! Thank you! This is a great day for Ronnie Laws fans everywhere! After having this classic record in my collection on vinyl for years, I am ecstatic to finally have it available on CD! ""Every Generation"" was Ronnie at the top of his game. The song, ""Every Generation"" even found its way to the TV show, ""Soul Train"", which said a lot back in those days. To the powers-that-be: please re-release ""In The Groove"" on CD, and I will be a happy girl!"
5,Rejoice!!!!! A classic is finally re-released!!!!,"I think Ronnie Laws fans are finally happy that this cd has finally hit stores again!! Besides ""Solid Ground"", this is my favorite Ronnie Laws albums. The standout track ""Young Child"" is enough to call this album classic!!! I love you Ronnie Laws and please re-release ALL of your albums!!! I will buy them!!!!"
3,Good Early 80's Ronnie Laws,"I first got into Ronnie Laws from Earth, Wind & Fire's ""Last Days And Time"" Columbia L.P. On ""Every Generation"" he continues blowing that sweet soprano sax I come to know and love. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the title track; it's great inspiration for a bad day. This album is probably not as good as his previous efforts, but if you are a Ronnie Laws fan as I am, it's an excellent addition to your collection. Any chance that ""Flame"" will be released on CD? Now that's a REAL classic!"
4,Master information,"I know this book has wonderful information and teaching; however, it is a tough read so far. The longest introduction to tell you it's not just about drawing/painting, it's the feelings and expression that makes an artist. But, sometimes going through pain (decifering what the author is saying) a master will make. This book was recommended by my teacher and I totally respect his opinion."
4,Charming,Charming...and well presented. Not earth shattering...but well done...Well written...could sure use an update...but really gives sound information. I purchased this time a Kindle version...and it is well done...love my Kindle (and iPad)
1,POOR low resolution images!!!!,"I was expecting to be able to enlarge the images so I could at least see sharp lines in the illustrations. But no,low resolution scans. How hard is it to scan this VISUAL oriented a a decent scan level? Answer: EASY. Very lazyprep of this book. The company should be ashamed, and AMAZON should be ashamed - as it was also prepared by them.The version I am speaking of is: The Practice and Science of Drawing [Kindle Edition]Harold Speed (Author), Superior Formatting Publishing (Editor)"
1,poor illustrations,"This edition of the book, The Practice and Science of Drawing, which I purchased for a drawing class was useless. The illustrations were extremely poor quality as if they had been done with a low-resolution scanner. Even the captions for the illustrations are difficult to read. The text is wordy but helpful in understanding drawing theory, but without clear illustrations it is difficult to fully see what the author is saying. In addition, there is no publication data. Is this a legitimate publication or just a pirated copy in a fancy cover? Don't buy this version.[...]"
2,Practice and Science of Drawing,"Somewho this book did not offer anything to me. There was nothing that led me into art history, not to the actual practical drawing techinques."
1,keep looking,"Like his book on painting, this book is hard to read. It was meandering, difficult to follow and gave more on the philosophy of good drawing and useless discourse on the intangible portions of drawing like 'rhythm and passion' than any usable information on the practice of drawing. A prefect example: he disregards the stomp as an embarrassing chapter in the history of draftsmanship, where the stomp is an indispensable tool to any professional artist today.I was looking for a book that gave a good technical manual on fine art drawing; how to render convincing pictures and measures of proportion. I fount none of these things. This book does have a safety though, it is so incoherent and difficult to follow I doubt most people could finish it. Go check out something on classical figure drawing, or check out the book recommendations list at any ARC certified atelier.CCJ"
5,The Best Book on Drawing (theory)... Period.,"I'm now a professional illustrator and art director. But for 17 years... from adolescence on, I was a hobbyist... someone who just loved to draw. It was this book, INGENIOUSLY simple and straightforward in both it's presentation and elucidation of ""how to see,"" which brought me from hobbyist, to professional. I learned more from reading this book than from thumbing through any of the other 50+ art-technique books in my collection (this is a book to be read... primarily text, not primarily illustrations). Get this book. If like me, you're self-taught... and you already know how to draw... and are looking to hit the next level, it's invaluable."
1,"Worthless in kindle format, try the actual book","Don't buy the kindle edition of this book. The size of the images is ridiculously tiny. Even if you read the book with the kindle application on your computer, the images will display only slightly large than thumbnails.Completely worthless as an art instruction book when limited to these sizes."
1,"NOT a ""how to draw"" book.","I purchased this based on the numerous reviews here and glowing recommendations elsewhere online, but it has turned out to be the poorest choice and truly the most useless book on drawing I've ever read. I wish I hadn't ignored the fact that others commented about nearly everything except actual drawing instruction. I wish my mind had registered the key words analysis and theory in so many others glowing reviews. If you want to learn to draw, or learn to actually apply lines, mass, tone, balance, proportion, etc. to improve your drawing skills then look elsewhere. However, if you want to read one author's horribly long winded rambling lectures about how these things influence art, perception, and the psyche then this is the book for you. This is far more an analysis of drawing as it relates to art than it is a tutorial. Nearly three hundred pages and you could compress the portions related to applying these ideas to your own drawing down to two dozen pages at most."
5,GREAT FOR AVOCADOES,"I USE IT TO PICK AVOCADOS FROM OUR TREES. ALSO GREAT FOR PICKING ORANGES, LEMONS, OR ANY FRUIT. WOULD RECOMEND TO ALL FRIEDNS."
1,this fruit picking doesn't work,Do not buy this fruit picker. You'll be frustrated becuase you can't cut the stem. what a waste of money and time.
4,this is a collection of childrens music for all us grown ups,"Is this the last real recording of a great balladeer? A collection of train songs that span several decades and mood. The CD features an unlisted number 16: Jessie dreamed of trains. This Vince Gill song is expressed poignantly by John. Also featured are Steel Rails that was sung by Alison Krauss, and City Of New Orleans that has been sung by a lot of artists (and once before by John) Honourable mentions go to the songs Daddy, what's a train, and The little engine that could, reflecting the children's album character."
4,Good Grammy Choice,"This CD deserves accolaides. I love trains and my only reservation is that he didn't write any of the songs. As a teenager, I commuted to school from Connecticut to New York by train. Later I collected all the Hallmark train Christmas ornaments. The kids of today don't know trains the way few of us can appreciate riding horses for transportation. Who says this has to be for kids."
2,Not 1oz/2oz,"This is a very nice bar measure - high quality, nice styling - but it is a 2cl/4cl (which is close to 0.75oz/1.5oz) not a 1/2 measure.I would give this a higher rating, but it was not what I expected or wanted when I ordered it."
1,Not As Described...,"This is a stylish measuring device. Unfortunately, it is not as described or what I ordered.It measures 1-1/2 ounces and 1/2 ounce respectively. Not 2 ounces and 1 ounce.Also, it is made in China. Not Germany."
1,Dito Not as described,Wish I had read the prior 1 star review. Why advertise it as 1 and 2 Ozs when in reality it's 2/3's of an Oz and something over 1.5 Ozs? It's going back to Amazon.
4,Fusion History,"This was a good book overall. It is definitely a science history book with lots of real science thrown in. Well written, but a little difficult to get into. I used the book for some school research."
3,Barry can do much better...,"Like several of the other reviewers, I try to read anything that I can find written by Dave Barry. Unlike most of the other reviewers, however, I would not list this book among his best. There were certainly a few moments when I had that standard ""laugh out loud"" response to Barry's wit. However, this book really read to me like an excuse to publish and sell a book without too much work. Most of his other books that I have read and thoroughly enjoyed included a lot more text and fewer pictures. The genius of Barry's writing is his ability to use everybody language in hysterical ways, and this ""Gift Guide"" doesn't allow him a platform for his usual linguistic shenanigans.In short, it's a quick and easy read with a lot of pictures. It does offer a few good laughs. But given the body of his work, I would recommend his other books well ahead of this one."
3,"Amusing, but too short for him to stretch out his brand of wit","I'm a big Dave Barry fan, but somehow I missed this one. So here's a quick October, 2011 review.How about this for a perfect opportunity? Dave Barry unleashes his wit on goofy stuff you can actually buy. Great concept, but...Each item gets about one page of text, if that, and although his sense of humor is very much there, he doesn't really give himself the room to run with it. Also, a shortage of actual items makes for a very small book. I bought it from an Amazon reseller for less than $2, and with shipping it was still a small $6 book.Although, like Barry himself, I'm too lazy to do research, I'm certain there are a LOT more products out there on which he could have unleashed his infectios brand of humor. As it stands, this book is fun but just way too short."
4,A quick read for the Dave Barry fan,"I can't see reading this book over and over, but the ""Mr. Dip Lip"" is funny every time I imagine some poor, hungover fool waking up to, ""Hello Bob, WELCOME TO HELL!"""
5,"Good dancing, good instruction","I find the dancing to be imaginative. And the moves make for a great workout. The instructions are brief, which some people may find frustrating. But you can always review them in slo-mo, and I prefer that to wasting time with overly detailed tedious instructions. I like the video backdrop with the abandoned warehouse style. I don't care for the pseudo-vintage clip that precedes each dance piece, but that's a matter of taste."
3,"Cool, but short and difficult to learn","Great music, hot dancer and costumes, well taped... a feast for the eyes.Yet, it is not done well from learning perspective. The routines are short (5-10 mins) and they show only once how to do something... so if you want to practice it you'd have to keep rewinding again and again. Not very user-friendly. Other dance tapes I've bought helped me learn the steps by repetition while dancing - that's way more fun.The Latin routine was the easiest as it is slower, but the other two - forget it. The creators had a good idea with it all, but just weren't well versed in how to make learning a routine fun and easy."
3,It's Fun and Sexy But...,"I really wish they broke all the moves down more. She does each move once and expects you to have it when you don't, so you're forced to keep going back and going back and doing it over and over again. All in all the ""move breakdown"" is about seven minutes long...about as long as the actual dance. It'll take me about a month to learn just one dance. I did the dance four times today and I still don't have it. I did break a sweat trying to keep up though. When I finally learn the dances I'll be happy and I'll like the video much more...it's just gonna take a really long time. However, I think the option where you can watch it from behind is cool."
3,I'm too much!,"I got this CD because it features the cult favorites ""Heat Miser"" and ""Snow Miser"" fromThe Year Without a Santa Claus. There are some other good songs from the classic Christmas cartoonsSanta Claus Is Comin to Town,Rudolph the Red-Nosed ReindeerandMr. Magoo's Christmas Carol. But I hardly think that Ren & Stimpy, Madeline and The Beginner's Bible can be considered ""classic Christmas cartoons"" (although I like Ren & Stimpy). And with a 22 minutes running time, this CD is way too short. But it's still worth getting just for ""Heat Miser"" and ""Snow Miser""."
3,A Classic Too???,"The first album was spectacular. The Miser songs, First Toy Maker, and Silver and gold were Classics but some of the others I haven't heard in my lifetime and I have been watching since Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer came out in when I was one. Gave it a generous 3 since I enjoyed half of the album."
2,Leftovers,"Only a couple of worthwhile tracks on this. The last four or five tracks are truly awful. The producers should have dug a bit deeper into the Rankin/Bass classics and delivered a few B-tracks, rather than the positively hideous ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" that ends this disk."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"If you are like everybody else, you are only buying this CD for the SNOW MISER/HEAT MISER songs.If you like any of the other songs, consider yourself lucky.It was worth it to me to purchase the CD for these two songs, but I would urge you to ask yourself how you would feel if you hated all the other songs and only liked these two songs."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"For some reason, my previous review was posted as though I had not actually purchased the CD. I did.I bought it for the two songs (Heat Miser/Snow Miser).I hated all the other songs."
4,Leave the Light On,"This book was written in a straight forward no holds bars style that I can appreciate considering the scenes described in the book. My parents never sheltered me from much and I would recommend letting teen age girls with dreams of Hollywood to read this gritty view of the porn world.True, it is hard to believe that one man could control someone so completely. It is even harder to think that her family never intervened. I really did not read much about drugs. So why does Lovelace sound so much like a victim in this story? Because no matter how you say, she was an adult, she should have known better, etc. unfortunately, she was and she didn't. She gives God the glory in seeing that she is alive today. After reading this book, you know why I am with her on that one. If you have a daughter, pray she does not meet a man who treats her the way this man did in the book."
4,Disturbing,"My rating is actually a combined rating for both books: I read both ""Out of Bondage"" and ""Ordeal"" many years ago and I was appalled at what happened to the former Linda Boreman. I found both books to be brutally disturbing and I came to believe her story. Maybe the descriptions of the people, their behavior and the abuse in both books were so horrible, I just wanted to believe in her. Or maybe I could not believe that someone who had just made the most successful porn film (and, allegedly, the most financially successful film of any kind) would walk away from all that money if they were really doing it of their own free will. I heard Linda Marciano speak at my college when I was a Senior and, while I did not agree with the views of the group she had become associated with, I found her to be believable. Ultimately, everyone will have to read these books and decide for themselves."
3,Story of the story,"...Out of Bondage seems to rehash the facts in Ordeal. The same scene of Linda's initiation into prostitution is repeated several times in this book and probably several times in Ordeal. It is a one-sided story of how she prepares to write her first book. So it is a story of how she tells a story. It is Linda's story, her view, her perspective, her feelings. Out of Bondage does not present a counter argument and it doesn't need to. This is one woman's experience with the porn industry that seems to have a track record of profitting for men, lead by men, while using women in a sex role that is considered dirty or demeaning by mainstream society."
2,Partial sequel / partial rehash of LL's Ordeal,"Bought this after having read Linda Lovelace's first book, Ordeal. Out Of Bondage spends a lot of time retelling the same stories that were already told in Ordeal, and a little too much page space is devoted to Linda Lovelace babbling on about some lawsuit she had filed against her, where she owed some guy 40 grand... that part wasn't so interesting. Nothing here that wasn't covered better the first time around in Ordeal, and the things here that weren't covered in Ordeal (her going on a book tour for Ordeal) are kinda much ado about nothing."
2,Scale only goes up to 10 oz,"The shaker itself is great, but the scale should read up to at least 16 oz.In contrast, I have a cheap Boston shaker with a rubber gasket that costed $10 at BevMo, and it has a scale that reads up to 16 oz.Not everyone makes 3 oz martinis.I'm an ice junkie. I need all my beverages ice cold, whether it's iced tea or iced coffee. Whatever I drink, I love using a Boston shaker to get the job done.While the seal mechanic itself is great, it's a shame that the company only makes this model for 10 oz...Forgiving if it was $20, but for a $50 two-piece shaker, it's a deal breaker because you expect so much more. Not to mention, the accompanying strainer costs an additional $23...So far, I've yet to come across a quality shaker like this model that has a 16 oz scale for convenience and practicality. I don't wanna bust out a measuring cup/shot glass/jigger everytime I'm gonna drink something... 'cause I literally shake at least six drinks at various times of the day."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"Today was a very good day. An ebay order of books arrived, completewith a copy of this. Something I have been looking to buy for around 15years, and finally considered this method. Could not believe it. Stillremember reading it, and the cover (Bantam edition with the greenarmored pair looking out a cockpit windscreen). A great story or thehorrors of war, death and love, with something greater that has to beovercome.It is basically criminal that this is out of print.I'd be interested to know if Peter F. Hamilton and Richard Morgan have read this, and if it influenced them."
4,Classic Wartime Farce,"THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR was Billy Wilder's first American directorial effort and an effective if hard to believe wartime farce. Ginger Rogers is forced to dress up as a twelve-year-oldin order to buy train fair to return home to Iowa. Army Major Ray Milland who is stationed at a boy's military school meets up with Rogers on the train where he becomes enamored with her and her masquerade. The situations just take off one after another once the romantic sparks fly and are complicated by Milland's fiancé and her sister. This is a harebrained comedy of the first order and a classic film in the comedy genre thanks to Wilder and Charles Brackett's script, Robert Dolan's comically robust score and Edith Head's neat looking costumes. Milland's performance makes this a winner all the way."
3,Major and The Minor Great Movie ...Needs to be Restored,Major and The Miner is a Classic ...But The movie needs to be Digitally Remastered in the video department Very Grainy ...Sound is great
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed watching this movie. The cast were enjoyable to watch. The movie also displays Ginger Rogers acting ability. If you want to watch a romantic comedy and have some chuckles , then this will do."
4,I love old movies!,I have really enjoyed my copy of this movie! I first watched it on TCM when I was a little girl and have loved it ever since. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys old black and white movies and war flicks.
4,A little hard to believe but fun to watch,"Ray Milland plays an extremely nearsighted ""Major"" in the Army. There is a war on and his goal is to get in on it before it is over. He is engaged to a Colonel's daughter Pamela Hill (Rita Johnson.) Her goal is to keep him at a cadet academy and become a surrogate father figure.Susan Kathleen 'Su-Su' Applegate (Ginger Rogers) finds it too expensive to make a living in the big city and intends to return home. To her surprise the train fair is now double what she planned on. Her only hope is to pretend she is a ""minor"" to travel at half fare.On the train the path of the ""Major"" and ""Minor"" cross and the fun begins.Will Su-Su get home?Will the Major get what he wants?And what becomes of the major's fiancé?The answer is there are the big Maginot line and the small Maginot line ..."
4,THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR is a major comedy delight.,"I first saw THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR in December of 1942 at the Elwood Theater in Elwood, Indiana. My delight in this movie has not dimmed over the years. I consider it one of BIlly Wilder's major achievements.Ginger carries the disguise off quite convincingly and Diana Lynn is quite impressive in one of her first roles. Milland, Benchley and all the others contribute much to the fun. The transfer on this disc is great. I had owned an original 16mm print that went vinegar and this is a great subsitute. I paid 10 cents to see it in 1942 and now I own it for $14.95. These are great times ! ! !"
4,Rogers at her best,Ginger Rogers gives her best performance on film and even manages to put on her taps to steal a scene from her adolescent dance partner. What could be better than that.
3,MAJOR AND THE MINOR,Received this item and viewed it BUT while viewing it it skipped in several spots. Living over seas it would not benefit me to return it.
5,Absolutely adorable!,"I saw this movie for the first time as a kid -- back when all the movies on TV were old, black & white, and a darn sight better than lots of the stuff on TV today! I instantly fell in love with Ray Milland. I had already been in awe of Ginger Rogers glamorous dance routines with Fred Astaire!Rarely can I be in a train station without thinking of Ginger's transformation into Sue-Sue, desperate to get that child's ticket! What a wonderful visit to a more innocent time.I LOVE this film."
5,Fabulous for a weekend get-away veg-out!!,"""The Major and the Minor"" is, by far, one of my absolute favorites!! I originally watched it, hoping to see those dance moves Ginger Rogers is famous for. Instead I got a whimsical farce. Two of my favorite scenes include (but are not limited to) the ""seduction scene"" in the switchboard room, and at the end when Susan dresses as Sue-Sue's mother. Delightful and romantic!! A recommended flick to anyone who fancies themselves romantics!"
4,Zero Story Credibility But A Real Charmer,"This movie was a charmer, with some funny moments and two attractive likable leads in Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland.Ginger Rogers passing as a 12-year-old is a little too much to believe so you can't take any of this story seriously. One look at the very female-like Rogers and it's pretty obvious she's an adult, especially at the dance near the end of the film.Sometimes the dated dialog and attitudes of the time period make it all the more fun. Rogers was a great comedienne, not just Fred Astaire's most famous dance partner. She is the big star of this film. Of note, too, is that Rogers' real-life mother plays her mom in this film.This is one of those classics I really enjoyed when I first watched it but dragged a bit when seen recently. Sometimes, the more you get used to modern movies, the more some of these classic films can seem slow. This is an example. Still, it's nice to see this movie finally came out on DVD in 2008."
2,Not worth the recommendation,"I bought this book based on the Amazon recommendation - boy was I disappointed. The writing style is very hard to read, the characters are one dimensional and the pace is slow.Kate is a police sketch artist in the Rape Task Force. She is troubled by the current serial rapist and becomes friends with one of his victims. In addition, there is a side story about the relationship between her and her ex-husband. A love that hasn't faded. The concept of the story is a good one that gets lost in a very dry, slow, sometimes unreadable style. I agree with one reviewer that stated the author seems to be British and trying to write dialogue like an American. The dialogue was too simple. After reading Cornwell, Grafton and Patterson - this author does not have an understanding of police work and the culture of police detectives.The only reason I finished the book was that it was short (only a little over 200 pages). It was a struggle to complete it."
3,A Good Read,"I read the hardcover version; maybe the paperback was edited. This was not the best thriller I've read, but it was a light, enjoyable read if you can say that about a mystery thriller."
4,Worthy addition to the history of manned space flight...,"Makes the assertion that Apollo 8 was a more revolutionary flight than Apollo 11 because 8 was the first time humans left the vicinity and gravitational influence of Earth. The story is told against the backdrop of the world history of the time, the cold war, Vietnam, the Berlin airlift, the erecting of the wall, etc. Borman, Lovell and Anders were interviewed and contributed their perspectives on the flight as well as on the experiences that happened as they came up through the ranks of test pilots and astronauts in training."
3,"Well written, but contains some unrelated political baggage.","Genesis is a very well written account of the historic flight of Apollo 8. The text is concise and the story is well paced. The only real detraction from an otherwise great account,is the author's seeming need to infuse his own political views, as is very evident in the final chapter."
1,Out of focus,"Of all the history books about the space race I have read so far, and that includes a fair share, this is the most disappointing. Its recurrent emphasis on the religious aspects of the whole enterprise makes it appear more as a seminary reading rather than as a technological and human epic. The climax of the story is the reading of the Genesis verses (a whole chapter dedicated to develop this theme). We learn the number of times astronauts and family members go to church and to which ones in particular, all in great detail. On the other hand, we are shown the command module only in passing. The story line disappears in sympathy with the spacecraft every time it passes behind the Moon. Even the sense of adventure is bland. I could not finish the last two chapters because the focus was once again concentrated solely on the political and religious background of this groundbreaking scientific endeavor."
4,Excellent!,"Zimmerman's book about the voyage of Apollo 8 was excellent. It is as good as the books written by Jim Lovell and Andrew Chaikin. The book is an easy read and flows very smoothly. It has an unusual style in that the book alternates between the ""present"" and personal recollections from the astronauts as they were growing up. It serves to put into context how the world had changed when they became of age.One learns of the boring and routineness of space travel (I didn't think about that aspect) and that some ""personal"" accidents do happen - like a release of defecant or vomit into the spacecraft; again, one never really thinks of these aspects.However, since we know that the highlight of the mission was the reading from Genesis, you get the feeling that the book is anti-climatic after this point. Nevertheless, it is an excellent book and I highly recommend it with Lovell's and Chaikin's book to get a well-rounded experience of the space program."
2,"A wonderful story, poorly told.","What an adventure was Apollo 8!In many ways, the first manned translunar voyage surpassed Apollo 11 and represented the greatest single leap forward in the US space programme.Sadly, Zimmerman falls far short of doing the mission justice. Only half the book seems solely devoted to it; the remainder is filled with a potted history of the Cold War and uninteresting insights into the religous lives of the three protagonists.The former has been done much, much better elsewhere; the latter served no purpose.In the author's defence, ommitting these two aspects of the book would have left it weighing in somewhere around 150 pages (and no, I haven't counted) which possibly explains their inclusion - it's not a long book. Add a peppering of typos and errors of fact and grammar and you have a book that only the most ardent Apollo fan would list as a must-have."
2,A Great Story told with Alarming Mediocrity,"What a great story. Too bad the story is told in fits and starts as Zimmerman jumps all over the timeline. Just as the story gets REALLY interesting, the author cuts it short and moves on to some esoterica--I don't really care about what churches the astronaut attended. By the end of the book, Zimmerman is cramming ""GOD and COUNTRY"" down the reader's throat to the point of nausea.It also looks like the publisher didn't have my copy proofed."
2,Deeply flawed,"A great idea for a book, appallingly realised. Apollo 8 was a significant achievement and a pioneering adventure. However, this story is obscured by Zimmerman's overt propagandising of ""the American way"". His constant moralising and political hectoring obscures the essential brilliance of the Apollo 8 mission and the courage and skill of those involved. The last straw is his suggestion that the laws of the US and the ""capitalistic and democratic principles"" of that country should be a blueprint for future star travellers. Only read this book if you cant get hold of Andrew Chaikin's or Jim Lovell's books, both far superior and focussed on the real story, neither coloured by crass polemic."
1,Cheap construction!,"I was pleased with this chair when it first arrived at the beginning of summer. It was big and comfy. Here is the problem I had with it: It begins with noting that the footrest can be removed. To do this you unscrew the footrest legs from the main chair. That's easy BUT the connection is all plastic. By the end of summer, the plastic had cracked. The crack also affected the main legs of the chair, one of them broke when the plastic cracked. The chair is now unusable and I tossed the whole mess in the garbage. It lasted one season. I didn't realize it was a disposable chair!I wish the manufacturer had used metal construction for the connection ""joints""....then I would give it 5 stars!"
1,'Wingnuts 2' flight simulator.,2 short word: A WASTE!!!! Money and time. Don't throw your money away on this. Not worth the plastic its written on.
5,Good stuff,It was easy to use. It is what is recommended for pressure washers and seemed to do just as one would expect. Maybe a bit expensive bcoz of it's pressure washer safe labeling but I didn't want to take a chance ruining the seals in my pump.
5,"excellent, for women AND men, useful for success in life","This exciting book teaches and explains how to succeed in this world. I have used the 72 principles and recite them often as a reminder that everyone can make a mark in this life. Whatever you choose to do in with your life, you can do it with certainty and pride."
3,Not the original 1966 UK mixes.,"I purchased this a few years ago thinking that I would be getting the 1966 UK stereo mixes of ""Oldies"" for the first time on CD. Basically the manufacturers of this CD simply took the 1987 CD's and compiled the tracks from them. The CD inserts do include the original artwork so it may still be considered a collectors item. I also purchased the Russian CD of the US version of ""Help"". The sound quality is good and compares to the original US album release."
1,great material poorly remastered,"The original material, of course, is as good as anything ever recorded. Unfortunately it has been remastered by deaf engineers. The dynamic processing is so poor that they cut off the beginning and ending of the songs. They boosted the high frequencies so there is no bottom to the mix. I guess I'll just have to be patient and wait for the box set from capitol."
5,Excellent!!!,"After a ridiculously long drawn-out process with another vendor (Fawas Alharji) where i was basically screwed over, I found these guys who sold me an excellent Promaster 2500pk Super SLR Cam that came in exactly the day they said it would. If you're shopping for a top quality camera with STUPENDOUS service go to these guys."
3,Worth the money!,"Well I'm a diy kind of person and needed to refinish 1000sf of solid oak floors. This was one of the items I purchased in my quest to gain knowledge. It did help me to see a floor being sanded as compared to reading books about it. For this reason I didn't mind paying the money. I purchased the companion book as well.If you're thinking about doing a floor yourself, buy this, you don't need the book. Also look on utube for sanding wood floors. There are excellent videos if you dig long enough. One was better than this dvd.btw, the edger is back breaking work.You can do it!"
3,"Mills well, metal parts guaranteed,not plastic parts, which are what broke for us","Purchased this from Williams Sonoma about 4-5 years ago. It is now broken. Ground pepper well, had three settings, coarse, medium, fine, which worked well, but to adjust these you had to unscrew the cap. For some reason, the cap's central piece has broken. This has NOT seen everyday use."
2,Not durable,"This worked beautifully when it was new. Not frequently used over about 1 1/2 years I have trouble moving the setting to coarse. It looks like the leaning tower of Pisa because at the plastic segment, the upper metal part now leans toward one side. I originally recommended that this item not be bought particularly in light of the price. However, I just learned that the manufacturer William Bounds offers a lifetime warranty on their mills. They promise to repair or replace at no charge other than shipping. This seems quite fair and I may change rating once I see how that works out. It's nice to know some companies still stand behind their products AND that they're made in the USA."
3,not very easy to use,"The metal ball on top sticks in my hand when I use this. It gives me an ok grind but I don't like using it because it's over sized. I have a hard time turning the knob, especially when cooking and my hands happen to be damp for some reason. The pepper corns that came inside it have a weird taste and I feel ruined a few recipes. I could not place the flavor at first. It's pretty and seems sturdy but it's not used much in my house. I'd return it if my husband had not been the one to pick it...not that he uses it much either. He bought the twin salt grinder and we feel the same about it."
4,Funny yet enlightening reading,"Page after page of the most unusual inventions. Most appearently Japanese. A few you might have seen actually get to market. Most are funny, silly, but quite entertaining."
3,Amusing book but don't be mislead,"The inventions featured in this book were invented for the sake of the book - they are not actual products for sale in Japan. There are a lot of wierd and interesting products for sale in Japan (e.g. paper shredders for kids, or water tanks to place in front of your TV for video fish), and a catalogue of them would make a great souvenir, but don't buy this book if that is what you are expecting. The items featured here are funny and creative nonetheless."
4,What the hell is that for ? Those damn Japanese are Great !,"Yeah they make great computers, I like to drive thier cars,They have rad VCR's, and those watches always have the righttime, and one more thing I love the food, but man they makesome stupid things there in Japan. Great book Great readingand Pretty pictures of what the Japanese are making to takeover the world !"
3,Interesting,"From a historical standpoint, this is a good book. There are a few Gambit lines that are covered in good detail because quite simply they are considered sound or at least popular. The lesser known Gambits are not handled with the same enthusiasm. Listing them in alphabetical order makes it easy to locate as well. Even though Raymond Keene is a great chess writer, he is not infallible. Under the 'Grob' (1.g4) he states this may be the worst opening move if 1.f3 isn't. Of course this was published back in 1992, and recent trends show that a g4 pawn spike can be rather effective even if castled Kingside. My question to Mr. Keene would be: what about 1.h4, 1.Nh3, 1.a4, and 1.Na3? A trivial matter however which just goes to show you don't have to believe everything you read no matter who's writing the book. Buy it if you can find it for less than $10 US."
1,NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS,"The artists were listed as ""various"" in the information. Because there was no picture of the CD shown, I took a chance that ""various"" meant different original artists. WRONG! The entire CD was a rip-off cover band. Don't buy this CD if you're looking for original artists. I'm going to be very suspicious of any CD listed with ""various"" artists."
1,Overpriced,"You can buy the RAZOR with the CORD brand new from Target for $38, why pay $30 (including shipping) for the cord?"
5,"Witty, intriguing, and well-done","Fresh and funny Cat Caliban makes her debut in this mystery. Cat's new career plan is to become a private investigator; after all, her years as a wife, mother, and homemaker have given her plenty of experience solving mysteries and digging out information. While she studies her trade, she purchases a small apartment complex, which comes furnished with a corpse. Cat's quest to find the killer is marked with humor, poignancy, and consciousness-raising moments. Cat is a truly enjoyable heroine. At last a senior citizen detective who is shown as having plenty of sass and spunk! The supporting characters are also endearing. Borton's cast is loveable and well-developed. I look forward to more."
4,Essential for Grant Green and Larry Young fans,"The Grant Green portion of this disc is beautifully recorded and features some fine performances by him and by Larry Young. If you have the Larry Young Mosaic box, this disc will complete it nicely.The Donald Byrd album is marred somewhat by background vocals, which were overdubbed later; why didn't the reissue producer remove them? After a couple of listens, you can easily ignore the vocals and concentrate on some very good performances, especially by Jimmy Heath."
4,Essential for Grant Green/Larry Young fans,"The Grant Green portion of this disc is excellent. It's very well recorded and features some great, burning performances by Green and by Larry Young. If you own the Larry Young box set done a few years ago by Mosaic, this disc will complete it nicely.The Donald Byrd portion is marred somewhat by the presence of a vocal trio. Since the vocals were overdubbed later, I wondered why the reissue producer didn't remove them. It takes a few listens before you can ignore the vocals and concentrate on some good playing, especially by Jimmy Heath and Kenny Burrell. Somewhat muddily recorded, though.If you like Grant Green or Larry Young, you'll want to have this."
3,"If your into long indulgent keyboard instrumentals, then look no further","Known for his keyboard work with Lana Lane (also his wife), Norlander chronicles his solo work during a 2004 tour stop. If your into long indulgent keyboard instrumentals, then look no further. I found some of them to be a bit long-winded. However, there are some lyrically charged material. Bassist Kelly Keeling chimes in for two tracks and Lana covers a few more.The concert itself is an intimate affair with nothing too flashy. The band sounds great in both stereo and 5.1 sound. If you want to take the show on the run, Norlander includes an audio disc. It doesn't contain every song, but he adds a few that weren't part of the show. There is a bonus documentary included, and if you've seen the last Lana Lane DVD, you know what to expect."
4,Terry Farwell- takes us on a tour of deep space nine,"I thought this was very good, they showed the model of Deep Space Nine. They explained a little about how they did the sound effects, for instance, how they put in the laser beam effect after they fire a phaser. It was very interesting how they explained how they made Odo's shapeshifting scene's look real. and each of the actors explained a little about their parts, but I was surprised that avery brooks did not make an appearance on this video. Terry did a very good job on this tour."
2,A brief history of early samurai -- a bit too brief,"Although this book is easy to read and follow, I found it that it skimmed the surface a bit much. It glosses over many important events and people who were instrumental to the development of the warrior & samurai class, without delving too much into anything. I think that the format of this entire series is more at fault than the author is; however, a more informative, detailed, and equally easy to read is Turnbull's ""A Military History"".The one thing which this book does cover very well is the armor, and Bryant probably does know what he is talking about, as he is an armor specialist. This mismatch between the very deep armor and the quite shallow history made me confused as to who the author's intended audience was supposed to be."
5,"Samurai, bushido, and clan-wars-so it begins","Meticulous armor details and visually appealing artwork (McBride) makes this a worthy addition to Osprey's books of samurai interest, and it focuses on a little known period. For a reader seeking less armor detail and more on what these guys actually did, I would recommend some of Stephen Turnbull's books in addition to his Osprey titles. Again, the plates were awesome; I especially liked Queen Himiko and the sohei."
4,hollywood divas 4 movies,This is a great buy... a lot less expensive than ordering this through TCM. Great quality and great selections of the movies.
4,A great work but not his best,"This is truly an awesome undertaking for both reader and author. Similarities with the Bible abound, but don't be mistaken. Book II does not live up to Book I. This is not his greatest work. For that turn to the four masterpieces of the 1890s."
3,Leave in Refrigerator,"It was primarily for this book that Hamsun won the Nobel Prize in 1921. From this distance it's hard to see why. ""Growth"" is a pretty good novel but not spectacular. Plot: pioneer sets up in wilderness, gets woman, they start farming and eventually become prosperous. The pioneer is too much the ""cute"" father-figure. The other characters are mildly interesting in a gossipy way, and enough happens to keep the reader interested in the story.But a ""classic"" needs more, by way of universality or comprehensiveness or emotional depth. The last is out because the characters are all types and do the expected things. The second is out because the scope of the book is limited to one Norwegian family. As for the first, the book is too comfortable to describe any real conflict that might affect anyone outside its limited range."
3,Growth of the Soil,"My introduction to Hamsun was Hunger. I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately I can't say the same for this book. I think it would probably make a good script for a movie, there is an enormous amount of detailed direction within its pages.For those who like reading about the life of early settlers this is an interesting genre. The main character tames the wilderness through necessity and circumstance while literally living adjacent to a bustling modern society. Here lies the uniqueness of this book.The language is easy to read and the images are vivid. The characters failed to engage me."
5,Finding Norway,"I don't remember where exactly I first stumbled upon Knut Hamsun. What I do know is that after delving into his work, he is, without a doubt, one of my favorite writers. GROWTH OF THE SOIL was the first of his books that I read, and I haven't stopped thinking about it. Admittedly, it probably would have been a pretty interesting journey had I started with HUNGER and worked my way through the rest of his books chronologically, but I have no regrets. GROWTH OF THE SOIL, with its simple and brilliantly nuanced prose, affected me within the first few pages. In fact, the coming of a lone character, Isak, on the first page to the land that will eventually grow and become a community, is one of the best opening passages of any novel I have ever read. In a world where people increasingly forget the value of nature and producing the things one owns and treasures, GROWTH OF THE SOIL, is a wonderful reminder of how beautiful it is to go out and create with one's own hands."
5,Daily inspiration,"The ""Bounty of Allah"" by Aneela Arshed is very nicely compiled book. Ms. Arshed collects very inspirational verses from the Quran along with relevant sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) or other wise people. A great daily reference"
3,Shipped fast but not as great,"It shipped fast. Only problem is that the material is like a magnet for anything, so fibers and junk get stuck to it. Very annoying. Other than that, it's fine."
1,Downright Deceptive,"Please think twice before buying this game. My daughter received this as a gift, and I have never been more disappointed in a game. The object of the game is to find another player whose cards show a term that matches a term on your cards. To do this, the players call out the terms on their cards, hoping to find another player with a match. The Bible terms are not defined; no player has to demonstrate a knowledge of the terms; there is no requirement that players determine the meaning of the terms; the players never learn the terms by playing the game. They could be calling out the names of automotive parts, for all intents and purposes! No learning occurs whatsoever. I think that the advertising for this game is just deceptive. Kids can shout out Bible terms until the cows come home, but unless they are learning something about them, what is the point? Very disappointing!"
5,Hillariously funny - from someone who lived it.,"I lived on the Oregon Coast for almost two years. A friend gave this to me as a going-away present and it was the perfect gift. This book sums up all the reasons you wouldn't want to visit Oregon like sea-monsters, clever sea gulls, devious ravens, and, of course, the weather. All in a dark tone that perfectly matches my memories of the dark skies, and yet side-splitting funny. A great gift for an Oregon Coast dweller."
4,"The ATM ""bible""...that reads like the Bible!","Packed with info, but I found it too wordy for a technical manual - perhaps due to the translation. Other than that, a required manual for ATMers."
2,Not impressed,"My 10 year old son enjoys collecting model airplanes, we were really disapointed when we removed the plane from the package to find it to be a simple nondescript plastic airplane. Certainly not worth the $20.00 spent-- His grandmother was terribly embarrassed by the gift she gave."
1,Non neutral,"It is a propaganda book, like those in cold war times, the worse about it,besides not being an academic book is that the author has some personal issues with the subject.I would give it 1 star. if there were any lower rating than one, then i would give it that. also the author is unknown!"
5,Lowest Priced Quality Mylar You Can Find,"Considering you get 25 feet, and the roll is 4 feet wide, you can cover a huge amount of space. It's reflectivity is outstanding, it doesn't tear easily, and it's easy to measure and cut. For this price, you won't go wrong!"
4,Mylar reflector,I bought this product to help reflect some sun into my dark bedroom. It is doing its job and it seems durable.
2,"Nice service, bad product","I was happy I've found this particular movie. It came in time, good price, but when I try it there was no film. Some technical problem. I've got the refund without any problem and I've got an apology, but still don't have the movie. Excellent service, no film..."
1,Received as X'mas gift and did not work,"The product looked exciting and my son was eager to try it out even though he received it as a X'mas present. Unfortunately as soon as we tried it we realized it was defective, the line would not reel back in. We tried to look for instructions but nothing is available except what it is on the back of the packaging and the link to the manufacturer's web site did not provide any additional information. The one year warranty is a joke since they require you to send in $8.95 to cover shipping and handling and ship the defective part back. Given that the entire assembly cost less than that it is a pretty worthless warranty."
5,Surprisingly good rod,We got two for our 5 year old and his cousin. We only use them occasionally but they spin out nicely when cast and reel back in smoothly. They work surprisingly well for the price.
2,Doesn't Live Up to the Shakespeare Name,"The child who received this was thrilled with it because it has Spiderman on it. However, when the fishing line got tangled and we tried to pull it out, the entire reel broke off. The plastic just came apart in two pieces. It ruined our fishing trip. Very disappointed. This doesn't live up to the Shakespeare name."
1,can't rate it if I don't have it,"Well, I was pretty excited to go fishing with my grandson during the local labor Day derby. Ordered the pole in plenty of time (1 month) but it still hasn't arrived (7 weeks later). So I am not very happy. And I had to buy a new pole for him. Not trusting this vendor."
2,"Nice for practicing casting, but...",...it doesn't come with a hook! You can't actually fish with it. My 4 and 7 year old boys loved casting in the back yard but were disappointed they couldn't take it to the pond and catch anything.
5,Three Verve Reissues in One Package,"How can you go wrong with this 2 CD set that combines three late 1950's Verve recordings by Ben Webster, Harry ""Sweets"" Edison and Johnny Hodges into one set. Roy Eldridge comes along for the ride as well as a few other notables from the Norman Granz stable. This collection of music includes a lot of swing renditions of classic standards and some blues, and a few ballads. Each leader shines on his respective set, especially Edison who's selection of 8 tunes is heavily swing/blues oriented in a very Basie-esque style. Highly recommended if you're a small ensemble swing fan."
3,Meeting of Minds,"William Burroughs unique voice reads his eartening Xmas story while Kurt Cobain indulges in an orgy of feedback behind him. The combination works surprisingly well. While it may not bear constant listening, it does stand up well over time."
5,you would be foolish not to own this cd,"Kurt's guitar-playing here is priceless. He recorded this midway between Nevermind and In Utero. This would be the exact high point of his career.And what a poem it is by Mr. Burroughs! A series of pairs of dark legs (or are they the same pair throughout?) appears in this Christmas Eve story that hits you like the wind coming off the lake.Musically, poetically this is better than the 1985 Burroughs/Van Sant collaboration ""The Elvis of Letters."" It is a short cd, but it stands on its own. You will always have that moment with Kurt right there at the climax of it all."
2,pollack audio & abridged vocals,this is a one take dizzle.im a fan of both but this pressing is a sidenote.burroughs is awesome but disturbingly sober.if they had been in the same room perhaps magic would have unfolded. this is a cut-up...for the better?
3,Probably Not Worth Owning...,"If your a fan of Burroughs you will want to hear this at least once. Personally, I think with Burroughs, spoken word is the only way to go. He could read the grocery supplement from the Sunday paper and I would be enthralled.However, this disc is painfully short... something like 9 minutes 20 seconds .Cobain seems to be added as an afterthought. The fact that it's Kurt Cobain generating all that feedback is irrelevant. There's nothing noteworthy or distinct about the sounds he's making. Just your basic feedback and effects that any 12-year-old at Guitar Center could muster. Had the music been more structured and tied to the words, this may have been a CD worth grabbing. As it is, it's not worth the collector prices you see here on Amazon."
2,For collectors only,"Unfortunately there's not even much novelty value in this CD, and it doesn't add much to the recorded collection of Burroughs' spoken words. In one 9 minute track, Burroughs recites ""Priest They Called Him"" while Cobain improvises on the guitar, or put less gently, makes an ungodly racket. As with some other attempts at providing background music to Burroughs prose, the music merely distracts. The story itself isn't first rate either, the same story later appears in a more polished form as ""A junkie's Christmas"" END"
4,"""never trust a junkie""","It's tragic now when you listen to the priest they called him. Both Burroughs and Cobain having left us- but I liked the reminder of the Ministry reference to ""Just One Fix"". As someone else suggested, if you don't have it and are a fan- buy it. ""As since he was himself a priest, there was no need to call one"" sums it up."
2,Not that impressive,"I decided to keep this tool, but I have never been able to use it. It wil not keep any of my watches in place. Everytime I end up holding the watch in my hand instead. Wish I had sent it back"
4,works fine !,cheap and functional. So it does not come with instructions but i think one can easily figure the adjustments. The plastic studs may not accommodate thicker cases (easily slips off).
4,Must have for watch repair,Glad I purchased this tool! Along with a purchased case opener wrench I was able to get the backs on a Luminox and Fossil watch with out much fuss. Just wouldn’t have been able to get a good grip on the watch body without it for those super snug back plates. You may be able to get a good grip with something else but having the right tool for the job makes it much easier.
1,Movement with No Hold,"This product simply doesn't work the way I hoped it would. It simply does not hold the watch tightly. That being the sad fact, I simply held the watch in my left hand and exerting pressure used the watch wrench in my right hand to unscrew the back of the watch. I can not recommend this product at all."
5,Movement Holder with 4 Pins,Fast deliver in few days. Product is exactly what it is and can do. Well build quality! I have been using it few time and enjoy it very much!
2,Crude and cracked PIN,"The item came with 4 pin with plastic molded on (Nylon). Unfortunately one of the plastic pin has cracked nylon coating. So it is defective. And the overall quality is crude. The product came with much oil coated over everything, and the aluminum blocks have sharp edges and burl on the back and under sides. The holes for the pegs are not snug. I looked at it, just not convinced that it can do a good job of holding the watch down and securely. So mounting watches on it should be exercised with care.Unfortunately Amazon would not give me the option to exchange the holder for another one, because... it is sold by 3rd party but fulfilled by Amazon. And the 3rd party vender won't give me the exchange, because.... well it was not sold by them, but by Amazon. Now I am sitting in the middle, just want to get this exchanged! Frustrating, I might have no other choice but to return it, and pay for the shipping out of pocket."
4,It gets the job done,This movement holder is strong yet the nylon covered pins make it gentle on the movements and cases while working on them. There are instances when the pins can interfere with the work in progress because they are pretty high. Overall it is a good solid tool to have and I can't imagine NOT having it.
5,Great little gripper,You really need this tool for holding a watch as the back is loosened to unscrew it for replacing the battery. This watch holder was precisely machined and works smoothly. Great buy.
3,It works,"I had a Seiko SKX007 dive watch that was losing 25 seconds a day and that I wanted to regulate. I initially tried unscrewing the back with a spanner wrench but succeeded only in scratching the back; it wouldn't budge. So I bought a watch case openerCase Opener. I still couldn't get the back off because I was holding the watch in my left hand and I couldn't hold it steady enough to apply enough torque to the case opener. So I bought this watch case holder. That did the trick. Putting the watch in the case holder and then holding the case holder in my hand, I was able to hold the watch steady enough to apply enough torque to unscrew the back. The back came off easily.This tool is nothing fancy but it got the job done.Take my advice: get the proper tools up front and save yourself a lot of grief."
5,Awsome,"I love this camera!It's slightly bigger than a soda can.Touch screen!!Awsome zoomThe picture quality for still pictures is not that great, but its a CAMCORDER its made for motion pictures!as far as the Low light shooting (Night vision) mode its awsome, but it has kind of a green hue, some people don't like it...I do...its an awsome camcorder."
4,Sony DCR-SR42 Camcorder,So far I have been satisfied with this camera. It has been very easy to use and I love the size. I haven't used it with my computer so I don't know how well it downloads.
1,DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU OWN A MAC !!!,"The enclosed software does not support Mac OS.The only software for Mac the will work with this format is Capity Mpeg edit, a horrible program that will run you an extra $200.The Capity package is included with the JVC HDD camera, you may want to look there.I love SONY and the camera is nice but without the ability to put it on my computer the HDD is useless."
4,Sony DCR-SR42 30GB Hard Disk Drive,Overall I like this video camera. I am not familiar with all its functions yet. The only thing I don't like about it is that I have to manually handle the lens every time.
5,"GREAT QUALITY, GREAT INVESTMENT!",i have bought about 3 camcorders in the past. And always the same disappointment... bad quality.. bad battery... bad way of transfering video to computer to dvd because of format issues..etc..but This tiny Sony is perfect! it has all i wanted! Although the quality of the snap shots is not great...the quality of the video and sound are pefect! and the touch screen feature..gotta love it!
1,Don't Trust Amazon third party sales....,"Hi All,I bought this product from Amazon thirdparty by trusting Amazon.com...They have delivered the old and used Camcorder without any accessories and even they didn't send any Sale receipt to return the product....Even Amazon.com didn't gave me chance to review the product details as they added my credit card details...I communicated Amazon customer care & third party on phone and mails...but no response till now...I request you be careful while you do purchase....Thanks.Kishore"
1,Okay video quality with bad battery charging capabilities,Purchased this video camera for almost 4 months and now the battery charger is not working correctly as it sometimes charges and sometimes refused to charge.I'm now in Europe and it completely stopped charging.This is a very bad piece of equipement.
4,Off to a Bad Start,"Purchased this camera brand new yesterday. Once home, I plugged in the cord to charge the battery and the CHG light just kept blinking. I tried the extra battery I had purchased and the docking station, but just kept getting the blinking light. I left it for a few hours thinking that perhaps it will work, but it didn't charge at all.Took it back and got another one and so far so good..."
2,need suggestion ...,"i am going to buy a handycam for the 1st time ... i love sony ""BRAND"" ... i choose DCR SR-45 (for my price range and better zoom) ...but now i am confused that should i go for SR-42 or wait for SR-45 !!anyway, can i change the HDD of these models camcorder ? i mean can i put a 60 or 80 b in the place of default 30 gb ?waiting for your positive reply ..."
4,Sony DCR-SR42 - good enough.,"I got this camcorder a few days ago. It is very user friendly and simple. This is great for those of us that are not the most savvy. Sadly user friendly can also be a curse. Even though the picture quality of the video is great(still shots not so great, but thats not why I got a camcorder) special effects and other features are lacking. So if you want a camcorder thats easy to use and will make great home videos this is a good buy. You'll have few worries and no tapes. Easy DVD burn(just one button). If you want features and loads of them you may want to browse some other models. No light, but good night vision. No view finder, but the lcd screen is pretty good, I could even see it well outside with the sun hitting it. No adjustments to still picture quality. No special effects built into the camcorder. But really easy to use."
4,Great camera!,"I had to think twice about getting this camera due to the price, but I'm glad I did. I have had it since last December. I used it at Christmas time and was able to store quite a bit of video on it, before downloading it to my computer and adjusting it. You can adjust features yourself or just use the Easy mode. The camera does such a great job of adjusting itself most of the time during Easy mode, that I haven't bothered with other features, except for the night vision. That does come in handy when taking night shots, though the video is black and white when using the night vision feature. Downloading is SO easy! Battery life is long. Video quality is great. My only complaint is that still pictures are very grainy and pixelly. I was hoping for just one camera that would give me good stills and good video. For some reason that holy grail has yet to be achieved. But as a camcorder, the quality of this product is excellent."
1,Not Worth It,"I regret buying this camcorder. Video only looks okay when shot outside in the sun. If you shoot video inside, it looks very grainy. Forget about taking pictures with this camcorder since the resolution is so low. The pictures look awful! I'm buying a different one. Don't waste your money!"
5,Very nice,I've only played with it for a little bit. It is a gift for our daughter in collage. I think it is perfect. Easy to use. Small. Plenty of hard drive. No CDs! I plan to get a memory card just to make it a tad easier to transfer. But it isn't really necessary. Item was used. But in excellent shape. I think we got plenty of bang for our bucks.
4,Great Product,"The video looks great and is easy to operate. The ""Easy"" mode for videotaping makes this a great product for anyone. I mostly use this product for sporting events and family gatherings. Only down side to this product would be the camera features. Pictures don't come out very clear."
4,Except price every thing looks good,I am happy with the features it has. Very handy and zooming is really amazing.
2,the sound is terrible,"I bought one and returned it. This product has a fatal defect. There's much noise in the video you recorded especially in quiet environment, sounding like ""click, click"". This drives me crazy."
4,Good product,"It's a good product, it lives up to Sony's brand image. It's very compact. It's easy to carry. Good quality video is being captured..."
1,Not so good,I bought this product mainly because of its HDD feature. I liked the fact that the videos and pictures could be transfered and saved in a computer rather than disks and cassettes. But the video and picture quality is extremely poor. My Nikon camera does a better job than that.
1,Not Mac compatable!,"They might tell you this thing works with iMovie08, but they're wrong! You still have to get third party conversion software and buy the MPEG-2 codec or Quicktime from Apple to get iMovie just to import the files. All of this means loss of quality. I can't believe they don't tell you this more clearly on the packaging or in the spec's. If you're a Mac user, stay away."
2,A misleading and rather slanderous book.,"Although the author's biographical material is interesting, his one-sided attack on LaRouche is misleading and completely incorrect. He takes LaRouche's anti-fascist comments out of context (ridiculously at times) to paint LaRouche himself as a ""Fascist"". LaRouche's bad press in the American media is enough without this nonsense. I was very disappointed."
1,Mindless Mishmash and Bad Intention,"The reviewer is a resident of Mexico and is familiar with LaRouche as associate of exPresident Lopez Portillo and author of ""Operacion Juarez"" program for Third World debt re-negotiation and proposal for re-ignition of national economy based upon scientific principles of indutrial economics. Dennis King's diatribe reveals nothing of LaRouche's interventions in that arena which are increasingly recognized as significant by the mainstream Mexican press. King's blather is plainly designed to malign and mislead - this is poisonous garbage! Poor quality writing to boot..."
1,Who funds Dennis King?,"Upon reading the King version of Lyndon Larouche I found so many inconsistencies between what I persoanlly know to be true about Lyndon, as a man of science and physical economics, that I was forced to conclude that King is simply a man of little intellect, and even lesser morals.I became further enlightened when I flipped to the back of King's book and saw that he thanks the Smith/Richardson foundation for funding the book-length slander.If you want the truth, don't ask Wall Street, read the science of physical economy from the horses mouth itself. I recommend an introductory book in economics by LaRouche, ""So, You Wish to Learn All About Economics?"""
1,A book of slanders and propaganda.,"Anyone serious who have read Larouche's articles before realize that Dennis King is lying out loud. The reader should look at Larouche's documentation which can be found at www.larouchepub.com and make his own conclusions.Also, I suggest to look more closely at the author (Dennis King) and who is behing him in this political attack. You will find out that Dennis King use to write for drug legalization magazine High Times and was financed by the Smith Richardson Foundation and the American Enterprise Institude to write his book on Mr. Larouche. These are organizations which promote a Clash of Civilizations policy."
3,A scared little little man is king !,"I read this book just to see what the other half says.It doesn't take one long to see that King is out to smear LaRouche.I personally try to look for truth and honesty, and with this book it is easy to see why people in this country (USA) in particular, have a hard time trying to find out what is true!Having read many of LaRouche's writings, and seen him on video etc., the King book is so unbelieveable!But for those who want to do a study, you should first read what King says, then go and read what LaRouche and his associates say...they are right on !One thing that I didn't understand though was that King referenced a quote by one of Reagan's National Security Advisors, as saying something like, 'LaRouche has one of the best private intelligence networks in the world'.Which not only lends credibility to LaRouche...but is true !!LaRouche is more influential then ever...where is King?"
1,Of Questionable Authority,"The book was interesting, in the sense that a novel or any other work of fiction is interesting, but it is not about LaRouche. Moreover, it is inaccurate in the (few) sections that seem to deal with his ideas in any way. Because it so grossly misstates LaRouche's ideas, it is of questionable authority in its coverage of the alleged inside workings of the LaRouche organization. People who are familiar with LaRouche's extensive writings should read this book, just to know what's out there -- but those who are not familiar with LaRouche should go directly to the source to encounter his ideas, and approach this book as a work of fictional entertainment. Your time will be better spent reading ""A Program for Recovery"", ""So, You Wish to Learn All About Economics"", and ""Now, Are You Ready to Learn About Economics?"".... LaRouche's theories are focused upon economics, culture and history. These are Topics that this book does not even begin to examine."
1,"Slanders, slanders and more slanders!","I would give zero stars to this book if I could. This slanderous book reminds me of the books one could read in the 60's which claimed that martin Luther King was a Soviet agent. This book is equally insane! I read it at the library of the Swedish parliament, which has it as well as some books by LaRouche himself. dennis Kings book is insane. The swedish organisation of Lyndon LaRouche is filled with jews, africans and people from the middle east,and I understand that his international organisation is it as well! The swedish organisation of LaRouche is campaigning for the rights of Africa, Asia and the poor counties to free themselves from the european colonial tyranny. this proves that the author King is slandering the current presidential candidate LaRouche when he claims that he is a nazi and an anti-semite. Visit laRouches homepage instead and you will find that he is the opposite of what King claims him to be."
3,True To Life,"A bit heavy-handed at times, and more than a tad biased, Dennis King has still managed to patch together the only factual history of the LaRouche organization. My only real complaint is that it has not been reissued with updated information, carrying the story of this politico-cult to it's current status as some kind of latter-day Hole In The Wall Gang in suburban Washington DC."
2,Soap opera with swords,"I thought maybe this would be a sexy story about hot female ninja's showing alot of T&A. Not much T&A, but alot of over dramatized bad acting sword play. I really wouldn't recommend this video, unless of course you are looking for a video to learn Japanese from. You dollar!"
4,scorpion king : rise of the akkadians,this game is awsome especialy if you liked the the movie. it has a few set backs thu like the game is to short. i beat the game in 9hours including bathroom and snack breaks. the figthing is not all that great and there is only 4 or 5 big charcters. besides that its not a bad game. i still enjoyed the game and you probally will to but u might need the strategy guide if your younger
3,THIS GAME WAS OK BUT NOT GREAT!!!,"This game was a big dissopointment. It's satisfying at the beginning but then it gets really boring. The only thing that they try to make it more exciting with is by throwing out more people for you to fight. Then the game gets really, really stupid. I mean, it's not even fun to play anymore. Then when you finally get to the end you can't beat the bad guy at the end.So if you really want to have some fun and excitement get something like ""Lord of the Ring"" or ""Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy"" or ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time""This game sucks!"
3,A decent game.,"This game was decent. I liked it at the beginning, but when I got to see other video games, I saw that it wasn't that good. The graphics weren't good. The sound was good but who's dumb enough to play a game because of sound. Music:Repetitive. Voices:Extremely Repetitive. Basically I only look at the game any more because of the story. If i could find a book of the story i would dump this game."
1,Inferior Quality - Warranty will not be Honored,"I have owned two Hilfiger watches. Both lasted less than a year. The first watch stem fell out. After paying $12.00 and the cost to ship it to their repair service for warranty repair, it was declined and an estimate to fix the watch was emailed back. (double the original purchase price of the watch). When asked for an explanation why they wouldn't honor their warranty, they replied their ""experts"" determined it was not defective, I must have abused it. I didn't think so, but maybe.Well shame on me, I bought another one. This one apparently leaked...it had water in it. Same story on the warranty, including the high cost to repair. I must have got it wet...duh! It's a waterproof watch...I was washing my hands!.Never again....caveat emptor."
2,no se ven las agujas porque son blancas y el fondo tanbien,el reloj es pequeño para ser de hombre y las agujas son blancas y el fondo del reloj tan bien por eso no se puede ver con claridad la hora
4,Stylish!!!,"Never had a Tommy Hilfiger watch before. But the 1st impression is the best impression.No regrets for having this wrist watch.Only drawback is the length of the strip. It would have been even more attractive, if they provide with a little long strip."
5,GREAT PRODUCT I AM HIGHLY SATISFY,"I have just received the watch and I am in love with it. It's all what I was looking for. Not too small, not too big, it's elegant and very fashionable. I was a little bit concern about the rubber band, but its very comfortable and looks very good too. I am completely satisfy and I recommend these product to very one."
3,Short,"If it was bigger, it would be perfect. Very short. In the picture it seems to be bigger.Best regards"
1,I have not received the watch,let me know when you are shipping the watch since I have not had any information about it. According to information I have the clock Debio be sent on the 16th of January but has yet confirmed that information.waiting for an answer from you. thank you very muchyoselin cabesas
4,Good Overview,"Agincourt 1415 (Campaign ; No. 9)by M. Bennett is a quality overview of an improbable military victory. In 1415, during the Hundred Years War, the English Army commanded by Henry V defeated a French Army many times its size. Bennett goes to great lengths to explain how this happened and concluded that it resulted more from the failures of the French to take advantage of their numerical advantage, then the brilliance of Henry V.The book follows the typical Ospery format. The most significant difference is that Bennett goes to great lengths to discuss the controversies regarding the battle as well as the inadequacies of the commanding officers. Bennett does not go overboard with his praise for Henry V and discusses his success and failures.All in all, this is a good read for one that wants an overview of the most famous battle of the Hundred Years War."
2,More of the same from Cristian Scientists.,"This is a very well researched book by reputable authors, but, they started with the agenda to verify the validity of their faith.Some of the statistics used for this book were taken from the typical pro christian sources.The bottom line is that they are arguing for a position based on their holy texts. Thereby rejecting the rest of us who do not subscribe to the same beliefs.Overall a very good book but the outcome was never in doubt.Just another tool for the haters to use regardless of the intentions of the authors."
5,a great game before its time,"ok if you have seen the movie you know how exciting it can be this game is amazing this is the call of duty from a few years ago , i paid 1 cent for this game and i am so impressed , it has nice graphics lots of game play, diffrent episodes from the movie. sure the charachters dont look excatly like the ones in the movie but were dealing with a game thats afew years old. but dont let that stop you from buying this . this is a classic and much better the some of the games i have recently purchused in 2006 . christian j nielsen"
4,Good basic game,"Other than not being able to save except at certain checkpoints which don't occur often enough, the game is fun to play and offers interesting challenges."
5,I love this router,"I recently purchased this router for table use only and thus far couldn't be happier. What I really like is the ability to change bits above the table with one wrench. With a twist of the raising-lowering knob the collet extends above the table and the locking mechanism locks the shaft making it simple and easy to change bits. I haven't owned it long enough to comment on durability, but a buddy has this same router in a table . He has a one man custom cabinet shop and has run hundreds of raised panel doors on his. He just recently went to a shaper. But his experience with this router was the deciding factor for me--as I said so far , I love it."
2,SAFETY HAZARD WITH THIS ROUTER,"I just bought the TRA001. I was preparing to install the router in my table so I went to take out the plunge spring access cap. With the base of the router on my bench, I unscrewed the retaining screw for the access cap, twisted the cap and with significant force it violently shot up nearly striking me in the head. I was not wearing safety glasses at the time (not considered necessary for such work) and had my face been a few inches forward I could have sustained a severe eye or face injury. I find no mention of a warning of this hazard on the router, in the instructional video, or even in the fine print of the Operating and Safety Instructions. Nor were there any instructions on how to perform this operation. I am seriously dissapointed in the lack of mechanical means to prevent such a hazard or even a simple warning. Please take caution when conducting this operation with this router."
2,Beware the collet!,"While this router delivers on the features that make it unique (height adjustments and travel), the designers seem to have missed the boat with the collet design. My current Elu router has the typical slotted collar and separate nut arrangement. I was disappointed to see the Triton router only used a split collar with a threaded/tapered body. I was not confident that this collet design would yield the runout and bit clamping force that I'm used to, so I returned it."
4,Very Satisfied,"Bear in mind that this is the only router I have ever owned. The router lives up to the hype as far as I can tell. I've had no problems with the collet but I wonder if those who have had trouble are using 1/4"" bits with the collet reducing adapter ?. The geared and free plunge work well. The ability to raise the collet out of the base and lock it for bit changes is a fantastic feature. There is PLENTY of power. It is solidly made. My two criticisms would be: 1. The user manual is too brief and hard to understand: Since the controls are interlocked, you do have to operate them in a specific order. Get this wrong and it might seem that the mechanism is jammed. 2. It is a bit on the heavy side. To be expected from a relatively high power motor, but awkward if you are routing free hand - not in a table. I'd give it five stars if I had more experience with other models."
2,poor quality,"I recently purchased this router and upon arrival found the winding mecanism faulty the collet apperared flimsy only one cut.The overall concept seems good but quality of product very poor, needless to say I have returned it"
4,Platforms for Scrabble,"This does work perfectly on Win 98, but will not work on XP or ME (the other two machines I have tried it on). Just so folks know."
3,more on OS issue,"I loved this game when I had Windows 98. It worked well on-line and off-line in W98, and is full of features to help you improve your level of play. A few features would not work when I loaded it onto Windows ME when I inherited a laptop running ME. But they were minor issues, and I played anyway. But that laptop died and now I have a new laptop with XP, and when I try to play Scrabble 2 on it, I just get a black screen that freezes my system. The problem may be the DirectX version in XP (version 9, maybe?), which would not let me write over itself with the version that comes with Scrabble 2 (version 6.1, I think). And God only knows what other things on my machine would quit working if I were succesful at replacing the newest DirectX with an older version. So if you are still using Win98 or ME, absolutely go for it. But until Scrabble is re-written to work reliably for everyone using XP, don't buy it for that system."
4,Scrabble fun for one,This cd- rom game is fun for one or four. The many options include easy playing levels as well as expert levels of the game. Easy to follow directions. Good graphics also.
1,"So, which OS does this game work with?","Although the web page says game is for Windows XP, when I received it, the packaging says Windows 95/98--I don't know if the web page is wrong or I was shipped the incorrect game--either way, I have sent an e-mail about this and will post the response--by the way, I will not eat the cost of return shipment as the game only $10, also I am going ahead and loading the game to see if it will work but I still expect some sort of action from Amazon for posting incorrect info about the product."
3,What? No bonus points??!!,"I love playing Scrabble with my boyfriend and thought that this would be fun for when we can't play together. Boy was I wrong! I mean, it worked just fine and was fun to play but what's up with the scoring system? When I build a word off of another word that had bonus score tiles, I didn't get the bonus. I got cheated out of points! The scoring system totally sucks but it's still fun to play and will hopefully help me with my game. Stick to the board game, way more fun!"
1,Kelley's Textbook of Rheumatology,Book clean; but advertisement led me to believe that the entire book (the first edition also appeared in a single volume) was for sale.I bought the textbook for historical purposes.
5,100 Degrees & Rising---Best Incognito Album I bought!!!!!,"Incognito really brings it on this album, man. 9/13 tracks hits a classic with me!!!! This is really for the 21 & up crowd that appreciates REAL MUSIC, Period!!!!!!!! My 3 favorite tracks are:#2-Good Love--Joy Malcolm rips this tune apart!!! Bluey makes this song classic!!!#8-Spellbound and Speechless--What can I say??? A real R&B; song with funky, upbeat sounds.#11-Millennium--Bluey lays down a smooth jazz track with a litte sax on the sideI love this album to death!!! No disrespect to Maysa, a true vocalist by herself, but Joy Malcolm gives her a run for her money. But overall, a classic album indeed!!!!"
5,Outstanding effort!!,"One of the first CD's I ever brought. And I'm glad I did. Bluey and company raised the standard of what soul music should be. I love ""Millenium"" and ""I hear your name"". Definetly not your average R&B group. Buy it and jam on!!"
4,A delicious musical journey,"I first heard the song ""Masques"" on the radio on one of the new jazz stations in Atlanta, when they didnt have DJ's...imagine how annoying it could be when you have no idea who's song it is and resort to leaving voice mails on the radio stations answering machine. Thankfully they called me back. Every song has a different flavor...for many different occasions. I love ""Madison Rose"", it is my ""therapy"" song....gets me into almost a meditative state and is so relaxing. ""Proko-Groove"" is great for.....uh, imaginative activities and ""Images"" is great for driving down a long stretch of highway. His music has so many different canvases, it's like visiting an art gallery in your head. Check it out, you will not be disappointed, if only for the title track, ""Masques""...a very infectious groove that has a tendency to stick in your head long after listening to the song."
5,KEYBOARD ARTISTRY,"I agree with what one of the earlier reviewers stated about this CD being hard to find in Atlanta.I moved here during the 1996 Olympics and it was one of the 1st songs I heard on the old 'JAZZ FLAVORS' 104.1 radio station. I went crazy for about 2 years trying to find it. For about 3 years after I first bought it I only played the title track.I DESERVE TO BE WHIPPED for not playing the entire CD and exploring the absloute rhythm,grace,and elegance of Mr. Saisse on the keys.This CD has to be put on the player and LEFT ALONE until the end.This artist deserves to mentioned with the best in the business.He knows how to strike a groove and keep it going.I forgot I even owned this CD until I went to see my son(Tracy Champion-Separate Ways) play in Tennessee last week, I just scooped it up to have some road music, I played it almost all of the 4 hour trip there and half of the extended trip back the next morning(along w Duke's Snapshot).This is a FANTASTIC CD!!"
2,??,"I am shocked that this guy has gotten such great press lately. He sits on the same joke for 5 minutes before moving to the next, and there is nothing engaging or actually even funny about them. Boring. I can't believe I paid for this."
5,A Must Read!,This is a beautifully written account of one woman's transformation from lost to found. Jessica Nagler's willingness and courage to stand exposed in front of her readers is a gift to us all. For everyone out there who is on their own path this is a must read.
5,FOLLOWING A DREAM,"A riveting story of one's personal journey. I'ts about listening to your heart, and reading life's signs. From the very beginning, I was taken with Ms. Nagler's spirit and courage on the path she set out to attain. This book speaks to the challenges she overcomes that transform her life."
4,Another example of the world helping us.,The author is a dissatisfied woman who is smart enough to follow the advice of a shaman/teacher. I love these booksthat show the worldview of shamanism. We in the west can learn a lot from them.
5,Jun Q'Anil is one of my favorite books,Wonderful book about adventure and spiritual growth. It just might change your life. I recommend this book for everyone. Enjoy!
1,"Shoddy scholarship, terrible writing","Again, Mr. Lehman infests our shelves w/ less Apollonious than should be allowed. That is the effect when a writer of few Spenserian means tackles subjects, heroes, beyond his artistic mettle."
4,a breath of fresh air...,"Lehman's presentation of the New York School is accurate (he lived it) and equally fascinating. The book is a breath of fresh air to modern literary criticism. Drawing on many aspects of the Avant Garde movement, and the influences of Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, and even the activities of the Beat Generation, Lehman presents not only the lives and writings of these poets, but draws the reader into the atmosphere of the times, making the book a pleasure to read. I chose this book to accompany a college honors project and I would recommend it especially for anyone teaching a class in the Avant Garde literary movement.The chapter on Ashbery was so impressive that I just ordered ""The Tennis Court Oath"" and ""The Skaters"" as well."
5,This book is a dream.,"You just can't put it down simply because you can't have enough of the drama and color of a period when poetry walked barefoot with a hard-on. One really feels like taking the next flight to The Big Apple and hunkering down to a cold pint and cigarettes in a dive with the windows steamed over with blue smoke. Today's poetic scenario stops looking like a dry dog turd on the road; possibilities heat up in you, hands seeking the comfort of paintsqueezed from a tube.You feel like painting, writing, sculpting, even turning gay ALL IN THE SAME DAMNED SITTING (no pun intended); you feel like living the dream. And that's what books and poetry are all about. Buy this book if you want a miracle--it gave me strength in a period when everyting hurt."
5,Great.,I loves the Diea Irae. Mozart's Requiem has got to be the best classical music work EVER written. It gives me chills.
5,Oil exploration.,"First of all, the music in this video is great. With Earl Scruggs and Waylon Jennings. Can't beat that. And I have never understood oil exploration and oil men. Now I do."
3,"Good, but not what's expected","I am a big fan of travel writing, but i have to say that this book was a bit too formal/bit to professional for what's usually expected of them. Don't get me wrong, they are still good stories and well written, just not exactly what I'm used to when purchasing a travel journal-type book. it was written so formally that it didn't really hold my attention as much as other books I have read. (for example: by lonely planet, ""Rite of Passage: Tales of Backpacking 'round Europe"" is a great read. try that if you are more into reading for pleasure and enjoyment and learning INSTEAD of a literary work)."
3,Vintage Foxx,"Technology and culture have changed so much from when Foxx's stand-up act was first recorded that it's hard to give this CD a ringing endorsement. The production is a little off, Foxx ofen sounding like he's in a well. And as for ""Uncensored"", Foxx here is quite tame by today's standards. Nevertheless, Foxx was unique in style and delivery and this CD is all Foxx. If you're a fan, you'll laugh all the way through and wish it were a DVD, since half of Foxx's talent was in his body language. He was just so human and real."
4,Very Interesting,My 5 month old daughter loves the duck. She is amazed by the shapes moving in the water. It keeps her entertained. I stay right with her while she is playing with it though.
4,Summer Fun!,My baby's familiar with rubber duckie so she likes this toy. We have used it at a summer house dock and it keeps her occupied.Verdict: so-so. Its cute and summery but not absolutely necessary. Her grandma bought this so I have no complaints. I'm sure when she's older she'll recognize the science behind.
1,Scary,I used this along with a tummy time pillow and put my three month old son on his belly so he was face to face with the duck head and his arms were hanging down so he could pat the water mat. He screamed like a two year old it scared him so bad. He will not go within five feet from this thing with out screaming and crying. The one good thing is that I probably could have made a million dollars if I had a videotape of my sons reaction !
1,Poorly Sized - Merrell must be going to the low bidder,Extremely poor sizing - have tried 2 increased sizes. I went up a full size and struggled to get them on past the opening. A very disappointing progression for Merrell. I have worn out several pairs of the non-Gore Tex.Definitely do not buy this model.
3,OK but not full of new things,It was OK and mostly worth the money but it was not full of new things for me. The hype on this book made me expect more out of this than I received.
4,It's a book on trying to improve your brain.,"Ever wanted to learn to hack that meatspace computer inside your skull? This book may help you learn how. Ironically, all I remember about the book without cracking the cover is the section on memory improvement."
2,"Lots of ideas, very few of practical use",Many of the 'hacks' are actually more difficult than the problem they are intended to solve.
3,Salinger Demystified,"Margaret Salinger's book offers much to anyone who wants to understand J. D. Salinger's books. I found it fascinating, especially so because J.D. Salinger was such an eccentrically private person. As a personal biography of Margarget Salinger, I felt there was more there than I wanted to know, but it was worth plowing through for the literary information it held. However, this woman is a survivor! This book dovetails nicely with Joyce Maynard's book, adding more detail to my picture of J.D. Salinger's world."
3,"What's the controversy? A balanced, heartfelt book...","Peggy Salinger has written a lovely memoir of her childhood and young adulthood, replete with the weirdness, trauma and delight that informs most of our lives. I am a die-hard and long-standing J.D. Salinger fan, and knowing that he was about as screwed up as every other great author does nothing to destroy the power of his work. I applaud Ms. Salinger's honesty, courage, and writing skills."
4,Reads like a second draft.,"I bought this book a year ago and read it once and haven't touched it in the past thirteen months, so my observations might not be as sound as some others on here. But here's what I thought when I read the book: it needed just a little bit more editting. Peggy is a fine writer and she clearly conveyed to me how hard it was to live up to her family name and all, but I think the book was rushed to the presses too soon. She keeps going off on tangents. Like, towards the beginning she mentions her dad is Jewish -- then she goes off for several pages of statistics on what it is like to be a Jew in America, all sorts of information that has nothing to do with Peggy or J. D. as people. This is why I give this book four stars -- another go at the editor's desk and it would have been five."
2,Someone please force this woman to get some perspective,"I think its very relevant that this memoir is almost as long as her fathers complete published works. I read this book from the perspective of a man fascinated by J.D's supreme talent and found that his daughter had absolutely none of it. The continuous and irritating drip feed of hackneyed adjectives in every paragraph makes you want to scream. Her terribly wishy washy world view, where she spends 2 paragraphs explaining what makes a person who they are then damns them for their faults is infuriating. This book is vastly dominated by dwelling in the tedious details of childhood and avoiding any real description of her fathers motivations and drives.. She really has no talent for this lark at all...."
1,D-R-Y,"I eagerly anticipated reading this memoir written by Salinger's daughter. Boy, was I disappointed! I know it's crazy to say it was narcissistic (after all, it IS a memoir) but I've never read such a boring, dry, scatter-brained, anal book! The story was all over the place and I'm still not too sure what kind of childhood Ms. Salinger had. There is a lot on the history of the Jewish people (which came across to me as ""filler"" to take up pages) if you're into history...I did come away feeling that she was a spoiled, over-educated rich kid who takes her precious highbrow education for granted. She obviously has never had to make a living for any length of time like the rest of us. That's about the gist of it as far as I could tell. Save your money and buy yourself a Frappuccino."
3,photos,"Just bought the book, so the 3 stars is not accurate. Just wanted to say that the book is worth it if just for the family photographs - 3 sets of inserts."
3,A Margaret biography; little about J.D. Salinger,Barely OK; nothing to say other that Peggy was a brat in a dysfunctional family.
1,Salinger more like Ackley Kid than Holden??,"If you really like J.D. Salinger, please don't read this book. It's just depressing. Frankly I don't doubt the truth of it, but do I really want to know what a nasty self centered oaf he can be? No I don't."
5,LYRICAL AND SMART,"It would be all too easy to dismiss Margaret's effort as an attempt to settle a score and cash in. I was thoroughly ready to do so. However I found her quite respectful and her insights into her father's work a revelation. I think she has much to say about idolatry, arrested development, and the illusions many of us harbor, not only about the writer, but the clarity needed to see ones own parents as people. It's clear she has come through the rye, and has a real grasp of her father the writer and all too human being. As a parent I know the joy my children bring to me is far more important than fame or attainment of the illusion of artistic perfection. I'm reminded of King Lear who banished Cordelia for speaking the truth. When the time comes my kids see me for the fool I am, I hope we'll revel in our differences."
2,There is a reason they don't post the specs,"when you purchase something like this, you would want to have all the technical specifications IN ADVANCE so you are not surprised.... so this is what you would really get if order this one:FeederMax #20578 12-volt solar charger. It is NOT the one pictured with the clips, but it does have a protective flex conduit around the cable. It is sold as a solar pannel (which it is of course) but what it is really made for is a very low power charger- specifically it is only 1.26Watts.... ya just can't do much with that. with no load on it, in bright sun it generates 20 volts (so be careful with small devices) but the box says max 18V.So if you are a hunter and need a to charge something small for low use, this might be great, but other applications- not so much."
2,Blast from the past BUT!!!!,"I had an awesome time playing all the old school games! Made me almost get a mullet again!LOL! BUT then after about week, my computer was running wierd,getting the blue screen of death,screen would freeze....Didnt think any thing about this game.Gave it to my Aunt and after she loaded it her computer crashed....The software,the CDROM was corrupt...Just got a lemon of a disc..."
4,"Björk made her first CD ""Gudmundsdottir"" when she was 12 years old","Björk made her first CD ""Gudmundsdottir"" when she was 12 years old.http://www.amazon.com/Bjork-Gudmundsdottir/dp/B000GWCM4E/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s;=music&qid;=1212173691&sr;=1-6It's pretty darn interesting especially if you are interested in exploring her evolution through the Sugarcube era to her stuff today. Interesting to see the evolution to sophisticated artist she is. Unlike most of today's media creations Björk is a true artist who was not afraid to take chances at 12 and is still taking chances."
4,How the [heck] does this thing go back together?!,"Ok, I swear the ""hinge"" on the spine of the pink case is going to snap under the pressure.Horrible packaging? Yes. However, some wonderful ""greatest"" Bjork songs for ""real fans"" that aren't just album tracks. What fan would buy the greatest hits? This is where it's at.I wasn't too excited about paying so much for it at the time (was saddened thinking it may be a ""paycheck"" or worse yet a contactual obligation. Anyone else dissapointed that she's lablemates with Metallica?!), but it really is highly listenable, epecially if you're the type to make mixtapes/CDRs (compilations only of course!) for your friends.Highlights are 3"" disc #2 and the special ""handpicked"" Bjork's favorite hits full length CD.Check out my xanga. You know you have one too. Screen name: Naythen."
3,Expensive for what you get,The music is certainly very good as one should expect. I already had a few of the tracks but bought this box set anyway. I have to agree with the other reviewers that the packaging is poor (once you open and try to close it again) and although there are several CDs this whole thing could have been put on two CDs and sold at a cheaper price....
3,5 for music...,2 for the packaging and the price of the item. Don't get me wrong I absolutely adore everything björk has done. But this box is so overpriced. It is also nearly impossible to tolerate putting all of the cds back in their little sleeves and into the box. Who ever designed this box should have been fired! It has some great stuff on here if you can afford the steep 50$.
3,Fun Board w/ Definite Pros and Cons (A 16 Year Old Skater's Review),"This board is a great concept: Practice your tricks without worrying about moving around. I personally use it on the carpet in my basement. The board is fun for ollies and balance even for people who already skate (like me.) I already knew how to ollie before getting it, but its still something fun to have.PRO:1) Learn tricks and perfect muscle memory indoors or without worrying about rolling2) Nice grip tape and super strong Ollie BlocksCONS: (DEFINITELY LOOK AT THESE)1) My board is already splitting on the edges and the wood is cracking/separating in several spots after 1 month of very light use on carpet only (I'm very lightweight, never did any crazy tricks on it, and used it only carpet)2) Not the most concave so flip tricks are kind of tough3) Really scuffs up floors and carpetingOverall: Better than ollieblocks since don't have to take anything off all the time and fun for a while BUT expect that it won't last forever"
3,I didn't realize what I was purchasing,"I guess I didn't read the complete desciption of what I purchased for my son. When the skateboard arrived and didn't have wheels, I felt frustrated that I would have to go out and purchase wheels for it. I thought why would anyone purchase a skateboard and then have to go out and deal with finding and installing wheels. Now that I see (not a skateboard) in () I feel stupid. My son hasn't used it because neither one of us knew it was a trainer. Now that I know, I'll let him know and perhaps he'll use it."
4,good c.d.,"I enjoyed listening to the hymns I grew up with. I keep it in my car so when I have a long travel trip it relaxes me to sit back and listen. This is a wonderful choir, they are a young group which to me makes the singing better."
1,Not good,I am very disappointed in this CD. I bought it hoping to use it for a prayer service. The words are not clear and the organ music on my particular selection was very haunting and did not match the lyrics. This was $17.00 I might as well have tossed out a window as I certainly will not use the CD.
4,Songs for an endless night,"Techno, the first word you can think of while hearing this album. Lulu Santos, one of the best singers in Brazil, create new releases for old songs(brazilian popular classics) in a new and unexpected rhythm. Attention to Ramiro Musotto, musician who plays ""berimbau"" at ""La Danza del Tezcatlipoca Rojo"". This album became a hit in all brazilian discos."
5,Fantastic classic,"A great, solid yo-yo for tossing around. Almost invincible, really. It's not really the best yo-yo for sleeping, obviously, but it's a lot of fun for looping tricks. Also, using it in the dark is pretty cool."
2,"Although great music, the CD is very abbreviated.","The musical selection of this CD is certainly what the cover says, however the cuts are very short. Typically 2 to 4 minutes in length. in my personal opinion I prefer a little more continuity of content."
1,Copland would turn over in his grave!,This is one of the worst sounding CD's I ever bought!!! Sounds flat like listening thru a pillow and the violins are schrechy and hard sounding.Its just awful.If you want listeners fatigue this is the cd for you!
1,bad panty hose,These are factory 2nd that were not the size they claim them to be. I would not order from this company again.
4,Why do we still have to wear pantyhose!,"These are good hose. It is just such a pain that in 2012 women are still excepted to wear these! I know in a lot of profession panty hose are no longer required, but if you are unlucky like me, these get the job done. I fall a lot, so I don't ever get a lot of wear out of hose, but I think these lasted a few wears."
3,The image is bigger than the music.,"Yes, I feel that the Lang Lang image has overtaken the musicality. But I must give the young man some credit here; he has taken on a couple of very complex cadenzas, and he does play the pieces quite well. Beethoven certainly does run the gamut of emotions, and the joy is definitely missing in these performances. Lang Lang turns the listener's attention to himself with exaggerated rubatos and dynamics, but the technique is clean and smooth.When I started my classical music label, I learned to listen to recordings on many levels and I must give credit to his recording team at Emil Berliner Studios. The production is flawless; the balance between orchestra and piano is perfect, the image is exactly as you would hear in the concert hall.Most people don't need the narcissistic 16-page booklet, so downloading is recommended."
5,"You will never forget these books!!! This is book one, read the other two as well.","I don't even know how many times I've read this trilogy now.... My sister's also picked them up after me and they were equally addicted so as adults, we still pass these books around. You really get quite engrossed in the story, and you never forget the characters. I'm was a literature major in college, but these are still up there as my favorite books!"
5,teh best,I can watch this over and over and it always warms my heart and strengthens my faith in unconditional love
4,The Magic of Ordinary Days,"If you like romance, you'll love this movie. The performances are wonderful and I have watched it several times."
4,it is not like the book,"This movie is so beautiful, but I wish they would have followed the book more. The book was my favorite of both. I wish they would have included more of Livvy and Rays relationship and the details that the book has."
5,A quiet story of love growing,A difficult situation of the time handled with dignity and grace. Makes you wish there was more of this compassion in today's world.
4,Great periodic piece,"This doesn't reacch the level of Dumas greatness to the extent that the Count of Monte Cristo and the Musketeers series does. But then again, it doesn't try to. This novel is a more humble, low-key (if such a thing can be said of Dumas!) piece. It's based in part on the life of the historical figure Benvenuto Cellini. Cellini was a goldsmith, sculptor and man-on-intrigue. The book is centered around several years where he lived in France and worked on commisions for the King.The story is made by the intrigues between Cellini, Ascanio (his protege), the King and the ruthless Mademoiselle d'Etampes. As always with Dumas you get action, romance and history. A great read.A very interesting comparitive study is to read this along with Cellini's autobiography, which is available widely and is the most famous Rennaisance autobiography - to see the more historic Cellini at work and to get an insight into how Dumas used history to create his works."
4,enjoyable,"""Hunted"" follows Edward, a young soldier with poor self esteme, a famous father and rising star sister. Edward has been told repeatedly how stupid he is. After hiding out and doing basically nothing for many years, Edward comes out of seclusion and lands in a complicated mess of political intregue. As the plot develops, Edward comes to question everything he knows about himself and his family.This book is pure Science Fiction, and takes place in the far future, with planet hopping star ships and alien races.""Hunted"" is in the same universe as ""Vigilant"" but avoids all of that other books problems -- no soap box sermons. The whole story is from Edward's point of view, and holds together in an entertaining and cohesive whole. This book didn't have the extra spark of a 5-star book, but I really enjoyed it and warmly recommend you give it a try."
4,Reliable entertainment,"Another fun read from Gardner, in the implausible but enjoyable world of Festina Ramos. Sure, you could drive a truck through the holes in the plot, and some themes and images are familiar to science fiction fans, but you still have a good time. Nice world-building and appealing aliens."
3,Not bad,"Readable, but shows how one missing ingredient can detract from the entire dish. It has an interesting universe, a race-threatening problem, mysterious machinations, and a ""regular guy"" protagonist. Should have been great! But, in the end it's unremarkable, perhaps for want of a contrasting low point in the middle."
4,Another good one,"This is another fun book from Gardner. You can't read his books to critically, because they all have some rather silly plot points, but it's fun to read, it doesn't get bogged down with too many details, and it's a good story. Anyone who liked Vigilant and Expendable will like this one as well."
3,Lobster bisque,"An easy read, but one that requires the reader be as slow as our hero to sustain real interest over the 400 pages."
3,I like Physics and bugs,"This book had no ninjas. Strike One! I tend to like Bikini Carwash movies, and the music of Jim Nabors. Not only did this book not reveal the Venus Butterfly technique as promised, but the inserts which promised to teach you how to defeat the Pie Factory level of Donkey Kong were marginal at best. For my money, it's hard to beat a good Iceberg Slim book and some Kiss and/or Scooby Doo Presto Magix."
5,Great read,I read a lot of science fiction and memoirs on the bus to and from school. James Alan Gardner writes wonderful books that immerse you in their world and take your mind off the slightly strange and too-close world of the bus.
4,Expect a good story and get it!,"I have read all of Mr. Gardner's previous novels, always coming away feeling as if his characters are people I know. Or will come across at any moment in my life. Edward York is different, not the razor wit people come to expect from a main character. Inherently decent and honorable, he is caught up in some of the horrific circumstances anyone could be expected to face. Anyone with a fully functional intelligence would be excused for going a little crazy, but Edward who had always been put down by his powerful father and treated like an amusing pet by his spectacular twin sister IS the main character. Along with James Gardener's ever popular Festina Ramos, Edward has to get to the bottom of the cover-up he was never supposed to be smart enough to detect. Murder, betrayal, fear and confusion have all been woven by Mr. Gardner into one incredibly entertaining story. I am looking forward to the next book already. :)"
4,Mystery and adventure in distant time and space,"In the world of the sentient and non-sentient there exists a world of treachery and deceit by those who try to bend the rules. With a multitude of plot twists and turns you will accompany a band of misfit expendables and alien life forms, such as intelligent moss called Balrog and elephant sized Mandassar's (or lobsters as the humans see it), as they try to save their people and themselves from the would-be rulers greedy for more power. Throughout the book the question arises: ""Just who is our hero?"" as even he himself does not know. Take a ride with some of your favourite expendables as they turn to liquid in ""Sperm Tails"", battle laughing larries, and try to fight a battle of the pheremones as war rages in the universe."
3,Enjoyable and sticks in your head,"As a longtime sci-fi fan, I realized that I had never actually read any Moorcock besides Gloriana (which I didn't enjoy). Saw this and thought I'd try it. It was pleasant surprise - sucked me into the story, and I couldn't stop reading once it hit the end. A bit predictable in parts, but done well; the world was very well developed, and the mythos interesting. I find scenes from the book stick into my head now, and keep popping up when I'm trying to work. I'd read it again."
3,Super Reader,"This co-authored book is sort of an adjunct to Michael Moorcock's Multiverse. I think it was written with a computer game in mind, or something like that. Constantine took Moorcock's notes and input and finished off the novel.The hero of the piece is Max Silverskin, a dodgy bloke who has to remove a magical mark, or he will cark it.Society is divided by an allegiance to a particular metal, and Lady Rose Iron will be an ally of Max's. This makes him an enemy of her clan's security guy, who has the hots for Rose.Questing ensues."
1,Not worth the money,"I found this and another Rescure Heroes book I ordered (Billy Blazes Firefighter) to be a disappointment. They were very juvenile for a four and a half year old, despite the age recommendation of 4-8 years of age stated on the Billy Blazes book we purchased. (The recommended age for the Rocky Canyon book (above) is birth to preschool, which is more accurate if your preschooler is under 3.) I expected better."
2,"Look up in the sky! It's a crow! It's a bat! No, it's....","This is bascially a compilation of bits from the many previous albums that were put out by the Laff label in the 70's. By the time it was the early 80's, the producers were really scraping the barrel by using none-too-interesting bits with bad editing, and in one case, a recording suffering from bad tape speed (the ""Rev. Du-Rite"" album, one of the last ones from Laff). So yes, there are some good bits on here, sadly undone by editing, sometimes when a bit isn't even quite over (the title track comes to mind). Get ""Are You Serious???"" if you want to hear his earlier material, it's one of the best."
5,"Durable, Functional, Beautiful","I've had this set for years and just came back to buy another one. They are a bit heavy, so not necessarily great on the go, but for food storage they are perfect. The clean design also makes them awesome for serving food. I don't tend to freeze or microwave things, though, and it sounds like that is where people run into problems."
2,lids dont work properly,"I received the product in a timely manner, they look great, but the lids are the worst! I have to keep going around and around pushing them down but the seal does not take, so I can't use them for anything liquid. Not great for travelling with as spillage is highly likely."
2,wrong color,"I specifically purchased this set (which was priced higher than identical sets with white lids) so that it would match my other frigoverre containers that have blue lids. Unfortunately they arrived with white lids. While I don't think it is worth the effort returning them, I will not be purchasing from this dealer anymore given their false advertising."
1,Frigoverre,Don't buy this if you plan to use microwave they crack with no warrenty. I put my food from fridge to microwave then heard a loud pop within 30 seconds and then the whole bottom had cracked all the way around.
2,"Great, until they break","My wife and I placed this set on a wedding registry but ultimately we regret doing that. All but one are now gone to the trash. Let's face it: accidents happen. Sinks are not padded. Kitchen counters are not padded. Other dishes are not padded. If you are going to market glass storage containers for use in that kind of environment, doesn't it make sense to produce a product that is resistant to breakage? Apparently not to the manufacturer of this product: indeed note that they don't even claim that it resists breakage. So every little slip or bump in the sink and another storage container goes into the trash. I'm not a clumsy person (I've had one broken bone in my life, 35 years ago), and I've had enough: it's 100 percent Pyrex (U.S. made even!) for me from now on."
1,Microwaveable --NOT,Thrilled tor receive a set of frigoverre food storage containers for Christmas. Cracked in two in microwave and we have hardly used it. Boo hoo.
1,Cracked in the Microwave,Shocking to read other reviews from customers that have had the same experience which I initially assumed to be a freak accident. One of these containers broke into two parts when I removed it from the microwave after defrosting a frozen entry we'd put in the freezer. Could have been a disaster had I not put it down on the kitchen counter. These should not be advertised as freezer to microwave like we've always expected with Pyrex containers.
1,"Used twice, Never Abused, Just Cracked!","We used it twice. When it came out of the microwave (not even very hot) it had a crack within an inch of going side-to-side. No warranty, you're stuck. I'm sticking with pyrex."
2,Disappointing,"Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre Round 4 Piece Storage Set with Frosted LidsThese storage containers are attractive and glass is the current recommendation for use in a microwave, which is why I purchased them. A major drawback is that the lids are NOT microwavable. I would not have purchased them had I been aware of that fact. Unfortunately, you have to read the fine print to discover this particular inconvenience. They are heavy to carry to work for lunch and you have to push the center of the lid down carefully and firmly or the contents will spill."
5,GREAT VALUE!,"the amazing band from england comes to the states with a furious value. this cd contains a bounus cd called the ""nightfreak"" ep as well. Magic and medicine is worth the money all by it self, but with the added Ep which contains 11 more songs the whole package is a steal. Sonically speaking The Coral provide listeners with a vista of haunting melodies, that range from dark to dileriously upbeat, all the while keeping the listener tangled in the .......er........coral. If you like pshycadelica and sound of amazing music give this record a try it definatley worth it."
3,Half of these songs should never have been released,"Some bonafide awesome songs are mixed with some tuneless bohemian jams. Between this album and the very low rent ""Nightfreak"" bonus disc, there are only 6 good songs. The rest are either very slow or very bizarre or very stupid. I loved the debut, and I love the 6 good songs. The band is talented and they are capable of some great tunes. But it's OK to not release every track you record..."
3,This was my war.,"I had been searching for this movie for a long time.There has not been much on this subject,either print or film.My interest in this film,is because I was in that war,from 1955to 1956,a period of 18 months.So thanks to AmazonI was able to indulge myself.There is another film around called The Planters Wife,which is a lot more authenticthan the 7th dawn.Steve."
2,Doesn't wear well,"First, I love William Holden; Stalag 17, Bridge on River Kwai, Bridges at Toko-Ri, are 3 excellent war films he did but this film winds up a 'stinker' in the end. Holden, Capucine, and Tetsuro Tamba, start off as best friends in Malaya battling the Japanese in WW II. But they each wind up going in very different directions after the war as the country is thrown into a battle for independence while under the violent influence of both the United Kingdom and the Communists. While the 'Red Scare' theme is now outdated, its the 'soap opera' ending that kills this film most of all. As the credits roll, William Holden drives off in his white convertable to see the world after his girlfriend is hanged by the British for terrorist activities and it just doesn't work. This is not one of those films that 'needed' to be brought out on DVD as it turns out."
3,Everybody's got to start somewhere...,"I won't lie to you--I was a little disappointed with this album, which was released much later than it was actually recorded (which was early in Richard's career, somewhere around the release of his first album; there's some overlap in material). But it's Richard during his cleanest hours, and it's still quite funny.In this outing, he relies more on long-winded anecdotes (played fairly straight), more slightly amusing than drop-dead hilarious, but my favourite bit is the 'Silk-on-silk healer', and especially 'Leroy.'I'd only recommend this album to completists rather than casual fans, but it still fits in nicely as a companion piece to his first three albums and the ""Live & Smokin"" video. By the time this was recorded, the best Richard Pryor material had yet to arrive."
5,The Book of Jesse,"The Book of Jesse by Michael Rowe is the story of a family's love and suffering as they watch and try to help their loved one struggle to stay alive.It is a book in which the author has shared his thoughts and feelings with us. In doing so, he has put into words what many of us have experienced in one way or another.As a retired member of the madical profession, I highly recommend it be read by everyone in the medical field. It will enhance and renew their empathy.To the author I say ""God Bless you and your family for all that you did for Jesse.""- Gloria M. Coughlin"
1,"Sad, self indulgence....","I don't understand the ""Publisher's Weekly"" review of this book. Were they reading the book *I* bought? Rowe makes Jesse's protracted battle for life into his own,self-serving tale ofRowe's (and his second wife's) quest to control the doctors, Jesse's mother and all involved in this sad story. Written in the style of a high school student's essay, there is truly nothing compelling in this book. If I could give it no stars, I would. Save your money."
3,Attention,"This unit cuts a fairly flat bottom dado, the outside cutters gomaybe 15 thou, deeper than the chippers. But the unit is not asadvertised, it is made of C-2 instead of C-4, no 3/32inchchipper and only 5 shims.R.J."
2,disappointed,"When I read a review prior to ordering this dado set, I was encouraged by the claim it cut perfectly flat bottom dados on a radial arm saw setup, just what I planned to use it for. It did not cut flat enough for my liking at all. In fact, it was a rough bottom that I had to go to a great deal of time and trouble to clean up. I was better off not using it. Now I have to see about returning it and trying a different, and not all that more expensive brand."
5,Excellent customer support,I had a slight problem that was resolved in a 5 min. call to Avenger. The person who handeled the call was very curteous and gave me excellent support.
3,Worth the effort,"Despite some jargon that it difficult to penetrate, finallys this book is an intelligent and original approach to film theory; his views on Eisenstein are fresh and valid, and he roams through film history with a confidence that elevates the book. Too bad that Braudy employs so much arcane language, as if written for academics rather than fans. Still, it's worth the effort to extract the fine parts."
2,Reads More Like A Rocket Manual,"This is a very difficult text to get through. Although it brings up a lot of interesting theorems, the language used makes this inaccessible to most readers."
4,Pretty Good,After searching for a companion book for the Book of Isaiah I found there are not very many to choose from. The choices are either a massive (400+ page) dissertation or this. I was looking for more of a history of the time period from Isaiah than this but this book isn't bad. It's meant to be a group based textbook but I'm learning a lot from it going through it myself. There are a few other books out there but be careful because they are Mormon based books. (I'm a Christian) Considering the lack of books available in this category I'm convinced this is the best you'll find. The best way it could be improved is to set much more of an historical background of what was going on politically in Isaiah's time.
5,Good bible study,Takes you through the book of Isiah thoroughly. Although it seemed a bit long. There were a few questions that were a bit confusing but we worked through it as a group.
4,Very thorough and packed with questions,There is plenty of material in every lesson to spend 3 hours on each study with your group. Probably should have been broken out in more manageable sized pieces for each evening of study. What ends up happening is half the questions and material in one lesson is ignored during a 2 hour study.
3,Don't Bother with Wii-Branded Card,"As others have said before me, there's no need to buy a special white SD card. The Wii simply uses the SD card as a data backup; access speed is not a concern, because the Wii doesn't use it to improve processing power or for real-time game saves. That said, I do find that SanDisk's cards are more reliable than PNY or other cheap cards. Don't be fooled by this ""high-performance gaming card""; get a regular blue SanDisk SD card and save your money for accessories."
3,"Great item, horrible price.","I got an almost identical version of this at Office Max; the only changes are that it's blue and doesn't have the word Wii printed on it, and I got it for $20."
1,this product is a crock,"one, this product is not really required to get the most out of your wii like it says in the description. The wii comes with a built-in, albeit small, hard drive for game saves. The only reason to get a SD memory card is to save games you download from the wii store, and even then, you have to download them to your wii and then transfer them to your card. Once the games are transferred to your card, you can't play them until you transfer them off of your card and back onto your wii hard drive, so don't be fooled. So after all of that, if you still want a SD memory card, don't get this one. There are sales on these things every week at bestbuy or office max or circuit city or any electronics store you can name. This is overpriced because it is the only ""officially"" licensed card."
1,Other SD Cards are cheaper,Hey everyone. I just bought the Wii and read somewhere that you HAVE to use a Wii SD Card. So I was kinda ticked off about it consider how much they are.I recently bought a 2gig SD Kingston memory card for $2 online and I tried it out in the Wii.It works fine. You do not need to buy the Wii SD Card. Your just paying for the name. Any SD Card is fine.You can pick them up pretty much anywhere for really cheap. Especially right now due to the Holiday sales.I just wanted to share my results.Good luck gaming!*RevJonnyTattoo
1,Rip Off,You don't need this Wii brand SD Card. All you need is any 2GB SD card. And you are not limited to a 2GB card. As per Wii Customer Service you can go as high as a 8GB SD Card as long as it's an SD HC type Card. Call and ask them yourself. Save MONEY Buy the one without the Wii Logo.
4,Great for Other (Older) Devices,It is true that the Wii does note require a Wii-branded SD card and thus you can save money by buying a non Wii-branded card. However one advantage to this particular card is that it works in my Epson PictureMate printer where newer SD cards (especially the high speed and larger capacity cards) won't work. So Iactually have a non Wii-branded card in my Wii and use this card to transfer pictures to my Epson PictureMate. Not only can't the PictureMate read the 8GB high speed card I use for my digital camera but also it couldn't read either newer SD card I bought at Staples to transfer pics to it. Thus the older format for this card and the ability to keep using my PictureMate is worth the extra cost.
4,It's a memory card.,"I don't know if I really needed a special ""Wii"" memory card or if I could have just used one of the million other SD cards I have laying around the house. But I bought it and here we are. It works. It remembers things. It didn't break during shipping or anything like that. I think SanDisk is a trusted brand. So if you actually need this thing (maybe I should have Googled that point before I spent the money) then this is a perfectly fine one. Go for it."
3,Not as useful as I thought...,I bought this thinking I would be able to save my gamecube games to it and not worry about having to plug in my old gamecube memory cards each time. But you are not able to do this so to me atleast its not very useful.
2,sandisk for wii,"My 12 year old bought this to help with his games. Neither of us could get it to work even after going through several sets of instructions. Don't feel I can rate the product fairly, though the instructions are quite poorly written"
4,Wii memory,"I'm not sure if we could have just bought a Sandisk 2 mb secure disk or not. This was recommended at the Nintendo website. We got a very decent price for it at Amazon which was comparable at the time to the regular Sandisk 2 mb. So, we are pleased to have it."
4,Memorizing The Wii,"Since the Nintendo Wii came late last year, there has been a big scramble for getting everything that is essential for the system from games and controllers, to even memory cards. Sandisk definitely knows that feeling for gamers of the Nintendo Wii. Their 2.0 GB Memory Cards are perfect for holding onto memory for Wii games like The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess, and Excite Truck. It is also good for storing data from games from the Nintendo gamecube library on the Wii, and classic games that you can download from the virtual console like Super Mario 64, and Bonk's Revenge from the classic Turbo Graphics 16 era. I definitely recommend this for anybody who has the need to Wii.Price: C+Convience: B+Overall: B-"
1,Defective - never worked,"Wouldn't turn on at all. Seller never replied to inquiries. Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money promptly under its A to Z guarantee."
5,Best thing since sliced gluten free bread.,I love this vibration trainer. I use it mostly to ease sciatica. I walk into the room where it is set up with one hip riding several inches higher than the other. I walk out 10 minutes later ready to conquer the world. Even my mother in law loves this machine. She cannot exercise at all but will sit on the vibration plate and it relieves her back and hip pain. I am considering buying her one for her birthday.
2,Even Louise Woodward agrees...,"This thing couldn't shake a baby.Seriously though, this platform is inexpensive, reasonably well made for the price, but in the end you also get what you pay for. It would be great for older folks or people out of shape...but to a person serious about fitness this thing has nothing to offer. It has *NO* settings for intensity (not to be confused with frequency). The vibrations didn't penetrate much above my knees-- which a massager could have done just fine at a fifth the price.Once again--this platform might be good for the elderly or weak, but not much else."
2,Ha!,"Found this last year on the lightning deal. Hubby and I have dirty minds and it looked like a cheap Sybian knockoff to us so we bought it. Tried it as that. Meh. Tried it for exercise but meh. I am not a home gym person. Rather go to the gym. Kids liked it the best, one year old would laugh and laugh every time she turned it on. Finally donated it. Just another exercise machine taking up needed space."
2,Dangerous?,"Not real sure if this works or not because the second day I used it (following the video with the elderly lady), I ruptured several blood vessels in my knee and thigh. I have been on crutches for the last 5 weeks. I nor my orthopedic dr. can state for sure this was a result of using the machine but if it is not, it was quite a coincidence. I would love to try it again but at this point I am afraid."
1,Not as advertised,"One reason I chose to purchase this product over others is that it had wheels for ease of moving. When I received this unit and put it together I noticed there were no wheels. I called the manufacturer about it, they told me that Amazon has the wrong product number listed as they build one with wheels and one without. They were not able to just send me the wheels as the bases are different. I did try the machine and found it to be cheaply made. I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
1,MONO !!!,"MONO !!! Beautiful music, beautifully executed.But how can you release a disc recorded mono.Such music should sound volume. A complete disappointment. Do not advise it."
1,Chelsea Bridge mp3: caveat emptor,"The rating is not for the music - Ben Webster's playing and Billy Strayhorn's arrangement are both wonderful. However, the downloaded mp3 contains a significant sonic blemish (it sounds like a click or pop on the LP copy that was used as a source)."
3,A bit disappointed,"After reading several positive reviews, I purchased the Max CN565S in May. Initially, I had no problems, but just after my first coil of nails, it began to jam and jam consistently. In fact, it jammed so hard, I had to take it in for service. Even after being looked at by service, the gun continues to misfire and jam off and on. I'm a bit disappointed to say the least, but some times things do go wrong. It's entirely possible that I purchased a bad batch of coiled nails, I just can't put my foot on it, but it's working reasonably well so I'll leave well enough alone.On the plus side: the gun is balanced and light weight. The depth setting was easy to use, but maintaining the setting is a choir. My gun was serviced by Duo-Fast Northeast. Nice folks; prompt service."
1,Old Lady Smell,"I bought this b/c I read that Nicole Richie had worn this sent forever and loved it. She must want to smell like a old lady...it reminded me of a European grandmother with a bad facelift! Come on Nicole, time to try something cool. May I suggest light blue, cartier, or child-just to name some good perfumes. Don't buy this unless you are over sixty years old!!"
1,not worth the money,gave this as a gift.. came from canada.return policy has a lot of loop holes.buy American and you will not have the hassel.
2,"Title should be ""Integrated Cisco OR UNIX Network""","Perhaps I am being a little harsh with 2 stars, but I felt disappointed with this book. I was hoping for this ""Integrated"" aspect, where Cisco and *BSD/Linux could interoperate. Take VPNs for example - IPSEC. There is token coverage of how each *Nix does it - with the same operating system. There is no mention of how a Cisco IOS router with ipsec can be configured to work with any of the listed *Nix! Perhaps others will find some value in the other aspects of this book. I felt the book was a disjointed mish-mash of topics that one could easily google, and get up to date information. I would like to see this book (2nd ed.) cover opensource BGPD, OSPF, Ipsec - and please, keep it recent and accurate (OpenBSD ipfilter with 3.3?)."
1,"For twice of the price of that from MIT Sloan Management Review Site, this is definitely not a good deal","Firstly, I like the MIT Sloan Management Review magazine although it does not do well on marketing this magazine than HBR.Secondly, I don't like the deal here, you can get the deal for $89/4 issues from MIT Sloan Management Review its own site. Not sure how do they manage their pricing strategy like this. They sell less than that of their channels do."
4,Useful to sort laundry in,"I found this laundry hamper very useful to sort my clothes in. I did not need to move it around, or take it back and forth to the laundry room, so i did not have a problem with it being bulky or the rods snapping out, but i can see how that would.be an issue if frequent moving had to be done."
4,Happy,"exactly as pictured, sturdy and easy to carry around. I use it as a catch-all at the bottom of my stairs. At the end of the day I can take all the upstairs clutter to their homes in one trip. 4 stars, not 5 because sometimes the frames come out of their sleeves and the hamper becomes wonky. Just a minor inconvenience."
5,A must have item...,"For anyone who works with lighting and needs an extra hand, this clamp is the answer... The design and flexibility of this clamp make it particularly valuable. Should be in everyone's lighting ""bag of tricks."""
3,Pretty good,"Upon hearing the first 3 songs I was ready to rate this recording as one of my top 10's for 07. However, there is a subtle shift from free-wheeling melodic rock to more subdued somber sounds on the second half of the cd. It's not bad but nearly as captivating as the sing-along stuff. I wish they could have kept with the vibe on the early songs; still very promising."
2,Muddling Through,"After 3 listens to these largely undifferentiated tracks, I became resigned to the conclusion that my enjoyment had quickly plateaued. The musicianship is adequate at best, the rhythmic elements are not particularly inspiring and the vocals are submerged in the mix. There is simply not enough ""there"" there and it feels repetitive in spots. For the limited range that this music trades in, it seemed passable, but it would be far down my list of go-to stuff on the I-Pod. I could go on, but I won't."
3,I had to give it a chance.,"I don't know if anyone else is going to agree with me on this, but I thought the first 20 mins or so of this movie were incredibly difficult to sit through. It was (in my opinion), to fast and to dark. It was just an assualt on the senses and as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't good. Now that I've said that, I fealt that after they slowed it down a bit, it was pretty good, and I liked it. The cast was good and the make up effects were well done, even though the violence was a bit overdone."
3,"Extensive, detailed review","Skip it.Maybe the DVD will have some cool bonus features, but the film itself is a disappointment. Some of the editing/scene transitions are choppy and hastily done. Looks like a rush job due to some last-minute meddling.Skip it.The changing-into-the-wolf effects are not even one bit more interesting than what we saw 28 years ago in ""An American Werewolf in London"". In fact, in ""The Wolfman"" we see hands and feet and the face change, but little else. Not that ""more is better"", necessarily, but it seemed more perfunctory than anything else.Skip it."
2,"So Close, but so far away...","I find myself watching the descent 35 mins of this film (the wolf/the gore) from time to time, but it falls short. Kinda like when Buffalo missed the winning kick in the Superbowl back in 1990 - great season with a tragic ending. This one belongs in a trash bin, but one can't help but stare at it wondering what could have been. Worth a rental for all Werewolf and/or Wolfman fans."
3,Promise but fell short,"The casting of this movie was so amazing that you feel sure this will be a great movie. Unfortunately, no. Emily Blunt did a wonderful job but that seems to be where the positives end. The story was lacking, they seemed to go more for shock & awe than a decent storyline. The ""wolfmen"" were almost comical, you expect something better in 2010. They kind of reminded me of a more mature & expensive version of Teen Wolf. The ending fell flat for me also."
3,Long on gore.,"Longer on snore!What this is is a fantastic period piece with beautiful sets and adequate atmosphere. Butthe Blu Ray, as pretty as it is, reveals way too much CGI for this thing to be enjoyable.Del Toro makes a reasonable showing as the haunted Lawrence Talbot, and the twist suppliedby Anthony Hopkins makes this thing watchable. The showdown at the end of the movie makesthis worth the time, but in the end it feels like this was just another wasted opportunity.The original had atmosphere too, more suspense, phenomenal effects, and no CGI. If you haven'tseen it, the new Special Edition Universal release does justice to the legend."
3,You'd expect more from a talented cast...,"Considering the caliber of the acting talent in this movie, I was expecting considerably more. It is a remake of the 1941 Universal horror classic, and I was hoping for a reinvention (or at least a homage) to the original. Unfortunately this movie is neither. It meanders here, and there never finding its rhythm. The performances are dialed in (Benicio del Toro practically sleepwalks through this one), and only Emily Blunt's character manages to shine at all. It is actually a credit to the caliber of the actors that this movie is even watchable. Had this been made with an unknown cast or less proficient actors it would have been relegated to the ""B"" movie bin."
4,Good Flick,"I like this, a bit slow at first but reminded me of the wolfman movies I whached in the 70s."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful",I have no idea what Anthony Hopkins was thinking when he agreed to this. It is absolutely a waste of time.
2,Disappointed,"Could have been a great movie. Over the top special effects cancel out good acting.I like good special effects, but they should be used to enhance a film, and rarely should they be allowed to take center stage."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"The box office bombing of this movie probably sunk the whole Universal classic monsters revival. It really isn't a bad remaking of the original classic. It has great atmosphere of 1800's England and some good actors. Special effects are good, but not always flawless. The problem with the movie is the 200 million dollar budget. I am trying to figure out where the money went. There aren't a bunch of 20 million dollar actors. The special effects are certainly not the highest grade. The sets and atmosphere are good, but not that great. This looks like a 50 million dollar movie. If it had been made for that much, it would have been lauded as a success and we would have heard talk of Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, etc. I think Universal blew the opportunity with this one."
2,its ok,not too good but its barely ok. effects are good except the end as another person said just a hulk like fight. i stick too the chaney jr movie
5,My favorite Horror Creature,"I have always liked the Wolfman and just never picked up the new blue-ray version until recently and I love it, the price was good too.. Always a winner with me."
5,Loved it,"I was really glad to find this DVD!! Fantastic condition, great movie!! I loved the price, too! The makers of this movie kept it in the tradition of the Old Classics. It is scary, and a great movie to curl up with someone, on a dark and stormy night, for a good scare!"
5,Awesome Flick,"Loved this movie. Anthony Hopkins and Benicio Del Toro are phenomenal. The CGI is good but not overdone. The location they directors chose for this movie is both creepy and beautiful and is one of the few remakes these days to trump its predecessor. Emily Blunt's character peppers the story with a dash of romance but it is not overdone and contributes to the film wonderfully. Hugo Weaving (Smith from the Matrix trilogy) plays a fantastic role as the Scotland Yard inspector. I swear he was born to play creepy characters. All in all, this movie lives up to and surpasses its expectations."
2,surprisingly lackluster,"For all the hype this movie got, once I watched it, it was a huge letdown. It starts off nicely enough, but started to unravel with a bad storyline and acting alike. The revelation about the mother, and the truth about the father just ruined the movie. For a classic and great werewolf movie, watch 'An American Werewolf in London'."
4,"I expected worse, but well done!","I was afraid to buy this movie. I expected it to be bad and even worse, terrible. But in fact it was good. I liked that it was almost 2 hours of the movie, that way I felt the story didn't lack nothing. What I disliked, was the cast for the movie. I didn't like none of the characters. And what was cool, is that the movie is done in old fashion. And atmosphere for the movie is really great. What was too much, is some scenes where the main character was dreaming, but thought he was awake and suddenly a werewolf appears, then again and again and so quite a few times through half of the movie. All those hallucinations he had were not necessary to show. And of course all the old curses stories of the Hollywood and silver bullets. I didn't like how they made werewolves, but again it's like an old movie remake. And it was pretty original. So I don't love it, but I liked it."
1,Wolfman Terrible,I watched it in the theaters. It was like watching a funneral. I would not recommend it
1,"Awful, beyond belief",How did two outstanding actors produce this terrible movie?Don't buy this DVD!!!!

3,I'm bored and there's nothing else to watch,"This movie is ""OK"" not he most exciting or glamorous, not he best, but if you're bored with nothing else to watch... this one should work. I was doing my nails and recovering from a long trip overseas... this movie was good for passing time but I would not buy it, and I am am Anthony Hopkins fan... I've seen far better movies of his."
4,Very good. .,"I carefully read the customer reviews before I purchased this--which I always do because Amazon customers give such detailed/specific reviews. Having said that, I knew what I was in for, and they were right it is a good remark of the original Wolfman with a twist. . I really enjoyed it. Anthony Hopkins gives a stellar performance no matter what he's in and what really appealed to me was storyline and that there was some gore, but nothing like what I'm used to seeing in these movies (say like in Dog Soldiers -- another werewolf movie) which was refreshing. I recommend!"
4,"""Good Horror Remake!""","Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins and Emily Bluntstar in this 2010 horror remake of the 1941 classic.A man becomes cursed with the mark of the beast.Benicio looks a little like Lon Chaney Jr. and RickBaker did a terrific make-up job as usual. This dvdnot only has nice picture and sound, but rated andunrated versions plus deleted scenes. I recommendthis good horror remake."
3,"Okay Movie, Slow Shipping","The movie was as expected lots of special effects. Most of the movie filmed in a dark background as expected.Shipping through Amazon too slow, one week unexceptable!"
2,good CGi but little else,"The movie required a prompt exit out of the movie theater. It wasn't a terrible film, but one felt that there were just better things to do than sit there and watch this movie unfold. The CGI transformations from human into a werewolf were done really well though. Benedito Del Toro was barely passable in the leading role and caused the overall lack of interest in this viewer."
2,Unfulfilled promise of a good show..,"Hopkins was good and so was del Toro. The scenes of violent animal mayhem were masterly done through special effect. But the story was too simplistic, the connection between scenes were hastily made and although Hollywood is all about ""make believe,"" this movie could not hide it, which is the matrk of a good movie anyway.There are several movies like that, and I guess any of them will do if you are interested about werewolves. I suggest you pass."
3,Mediocre,"Uneven writting, though (obviously) well-cast; extremely gory (not a good film for kids); bland direction; predictable. Good special effects."
2,So Awful It'll Leave You Howling,"There is almost nothing to recommend this outing. First, any hope that Benicio Del Toro might bring a touch of warmth or sympathy to the lead role of the tragic wolfman is dashed, almost from the instant he utters his first lines. Second, the contrived plot device used to explain the fact that everyone in the entire cast except Del Toro speaks with a British accent (sent away to America by his father at a young age) is so lame that it leaves one with the sneaking suspicion that it was a last-minute edit, inserted as soon as everyone figured out that Del Toro was simply never going to master a British accent with any consistency. Third, there is not the slightest chemistry between the tragic wolfman and Emily Blunt's character. Finally, the special effects were lifted straight from ""An American Werewolf in London"", only not as effectively. (Tidbit: Why the producers would miscast Benicio Del Toro so badly is explained as the credits roll: he was one of them.)"
2,Not exactly Hopkins' best showing ...,"Normally, I'd say that Anthony Hopkins could make melting ice interesting/suspenseful. This wasn't normal, so I'll choose to blame the script, the director, the phase of the moon, something. Yet another blue/grey CGI train chugging through a blue/grey CGI landscape. Have any of these people actually BEEN outside at dusk?I finished watching it last night, and I'm still waiting for a surprise.The acting was just OK. Hopkins was good, but it's been a long time since he was merely good.It'll be in the $5 bin at K-Mart soon enough. Watch it then."
3,For a special viewer,"A family story of father-beast and his family as all share a tragic fate of being exterminated for their bestial deeds.I am wondering some need such movies of late nineteenth century England nowadays, mixing British countryside with then NYC."
3,Review of The Wolfman,"The quality was great! The movie followed the old ways, which was cool. I've seen a few times and would watch it again."
4,"Blood, Guts, and Gore with Anthony eating an apple!","Most movies with Anthony are reasonable. This is the same. Del Toro as the wolf was a somber dark best choice.Watch the stair scene with Hopkins eating an apple. It is the first clue to his ""Animal"" nature..."
2,A poor attempt at infusing a classic with technology.,"While I appreciated this movie's strides to enable new viewers to experience the same fear that was created by the original (through the use of modern gore and scares), I thought this one achieved a more corny presentation than classic.The gore was blatant and didn't fall into a solid context of story. It was just kind of thrown at you. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't buy Del Toros character at all. Delivery was bad in the movie, and I don't see this one coming off the movie lover's shelf more than twice. In fact the second viewing will probably only remind the viewer why it was sitting on the shelf so long since the last viewing.I didn't like the wolfman appearance. I thougth they could have used better prosthetics and still maintained a resemblance to the actors features. They looked like the Adams Family's cousin It with a hair cut.That's my take. Rent it before you buy it!"
3,"Well, You can Rent it","(SPOILER)!!!I was not expecting that much from this film. I hadn't heard that much about it. Now, I see why. We all no that this story has been told before. So,lets not dwell on that. This movie is not a complete bore but it never really gets exciting either. The character development is pretty limited. We have this guy who goes back home because his brother is missing. His brother is then found dead. Later, the guy gets bitten and turns into a wolf. Then, we find out that his father is also a wolf and that he had murdered his son. It all sounds interesting enough. However, none of the characters seen really invested in the story. If you took out the scene where the 2 wolves are fighting this would not even be worth renting. Definately do not buy this one. It's not even worth it on blu-ray. Just rent it. HOLLA!"
3,The Wolf Man 2010,"I managed to see this movie thanks to a gift of tickets and I am thankful I did not pay,because If I did I would have given it 1 star!Wolf Man 2010 is typical Hollywood Remake. Lots of CGI And No Substance. And I knew since The time I heard it was coming and from the trailer this was going to be a snooze,but again, This was a gift so. Del Toro as the Lead Character Really? Only Sir Anthony Hopkins does a Half-Decent job. But My favorite character and the best actor in the movie is The Detective. The Movie gives you maybe one or two jumps, The Gore cannot even save it.It's like a M. Night Shamalaya whatever his name is type movie but worst. Think Michael Bay makes a Horror movie or So-called horror. The Movie is long and for 2 or 3 scares, your better off Watching Wolfen,or An American Werewolf In London among some others that are way better and Scarier. 3 stars because I am being nice."
3,mediocre remake,After watching this movie I have to say that the original had better acting and drams than this version. Everything was parroted from the original and not nearly as well. The acting was leaden and unimagitative and moved at a slow pace. Sorry.
2,epic fail,"How do you screw something like this up so bad? You have a classic story and the mist shrouded English moors make an inherently spooky locale, yet the movie is relatively scareless and the story has been turned into a furry Oedipal conflict. The main problem is that the script is awful and buckets of gore are substituted for chills throughout. Also, instead of being kept in the shadows, the monster is shown way too clearly towards the end and looks more like a pissed off pit bull than anything scary. The CGI is decent and the art direction and sets are really good, but good writing and well directed scares seemed to have been left off the agenda."
1,What a waste...,"We actually love this genre, and the previews looked amazing, so our expectations were high. I mean, considering the advances in CGI, the great cast, and the current trend to add emotional DEPTH to monsters, it should have been MUCH better than this eye-rolling slog.Without much of a plot, the film just started cranking out gratuitous GORE, which was not unexpected, but it was SO over the top, it became comical. The look of the film was beautifully dark, yes, and the CGI was fine, but that didn't redeem this hot mess.The consensus in our group was that it wasn't worth the price of admission, and maybe the worst movie some had seen in years. I usually check reviews before going to a movie, but got sucked into this with assumptions... (I REALLY expected more from a film with Anthony Hopkins. He must be so embarrassed.) Never again."
3,Stop Remaking the Classics!,"Hollywood cannot be that hard up for material. By remaking this 40's classic and basicially following the original script with many deviations and changes, hampers what could have been a good movie. Had they followed the example of the ""Mummy"" movies, which did not follow the original Karloff classic, they created a wildly sucessful series of three movies.This convoluted entry ironically casts Benicio Del Toro as Lawrence Talbot who oddly looks a great deal like Lon Chaney, Jr. (the oringal wolfman). But that is as good as it gets here folks. The original script has been mutilated, it is filled with flashy CGI that interferes with some very good atmospheric shots.Stick with the original. It gives the viewer more frights and fine acting in a mere 70 minutes than this poor remake does."
3,a lack of perspective,"I'm always amazed that movie producers and directors spend so many millions on sets, costumes, lighting etc... to creat fantastic visuals, and yet seem to avoid making even a minimal effort to ensure that the plot of their movie is of similar quality. The contrast between the beautiful appearance of this movie and it's haphazard pacing and acting is jarring. It could have been spectacular, but it was a lot less than that - wooden instead of gold."
3,Didn't Do Much For Me,"Despite the excellent cast and ""How can you screw up a Werewolf movie?"" plot I found it disappointing. It was well done, the story was solid, and the photography was excellent. But I tried watching it three times and always fell asleep before I saw the end."
3,not informed,I don't feel like I was totally informed that getting the directors cut meant I was purchasing the right to go online and download the director's cut. I thought I was purchasing a blu-ray disk of the director's cut. You should practice a little more honesty in your sales pitch.
3,Thanks but No Thanks...,"""Even A MAN WHO IS PURE IN HEART AND SAYS HIS PRAYERS BY NIGHT, MAY BECOME A WOLF WHEN THE WOLFBANE BLOOMS AND THE AUTUMN MOON IS BRIGHT"" - Sir John Talbot.The WolfmanEven made by Universal, with one of my favorite actor's,Anthony Hopkins,the Audio being made in 5.1 Dolby Digital and with all of the CGI effects, This ""Wolfman"" just doesn't do it for me. It's an OK flick but if you want to see the Classic ""Wolf Man"" get ""THE LEGACY COLLECTION"", BY Universal with Lon Chaney,Jr. The Wolf Man (1941), Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), Werewolf of London (1935), She-Wolf of London (1946). From these movies are several spin-offs of each one! You will also get the Trailers & Commentary by author & film historian, Tom Weaver."
4,theatrical version moves faster,"The photography is needlessly dark as are a lot of today`s films. Even the outdoor shots are dark. This does create an eerie mood, but I feel it was over done. I watched the longer unrated DVD version first and then skipped through the theatrical version. The theatrical version wisely cutout a lot of introductory footage which slowed the film down considerably. The unrated version didn`t really get going until Anthony Hopkin`s true character was revealed. Once the movie picked up speed I found it to be excellent. My advice to DVD viewers is to watch the theatrical version first. I then watched the original Lon Chaney version and it was interesting to compare the two. There is a substantial difference. If the viewer has the time and the original movie, I recommend seeing it soon after watching this version."
1,"Boring, boring, boring!","One of the most boring movies I've ever watched. I sat through the whole think and it was such a waste of my time. The effects are good, but the plot line and acting is seriously lacking. The previews oversold the movie and makes you think that there is going to be some exciting, action packed plot in store for you when in reality it's a dry, boring plot."
5,"benico del toro, emily blunt, anthony hopkins and hugo weaving. awesome movie.",i saw this movie 2 times in theatres and loved it. it was bloody and a exciting. benico del toro was a perfect wolfman. give him some slack people he was awesome. this dvd is amazing with a load of special feautres. the original wolfman was also exciting. bye them both. awoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
3,Its a dog of a movie,"Dispite a strong cast this move fails to perform. The script is weak and the story told numerous times before. The special effects are not all that special and lack the vigor of ""An Anamerican Warewolf in London"". Its a renter, not a buyer."
2,A big letdown.,"The director's cinematography wonderfully embraced the classic style of horror films with haunting landscapes & sets, even the ""transformation"" is cool. And although Del Toro looks creepy, its hard to find any of the actors believable and it was ever explained why the father hated his own son. Not to mention the howling never ceased to be simply cheesy."
1,The Wolfman Blu-ray Digital Copy Expired,Why Amazon.com is selling a blu-ray with expired digital copy authorization code and not advise customers about it? I purchased this blu-ray for a digital copy. I should have just purchased a digital copy from iTunes.
2,hollywood is recycling ideas,"There is so much in common with this movie and Bram Stoker's Dracula that you wonder if anyone notices or do they just not care? The setting in Victorian england, a woman who keeps a diary and is the love interest of the main character and who dresses in one scene almost exactly as winona ryder did when she was writing in her movie, the protagonist gets attacked in bed, anthony hopkins, a very similar death scene at the end of both movies, a rounded podium lecture hall, an insane asylum.. there probably is a lot more. I will admit that since this is a horror movie there are bound to be similarities of course, but still.. Bram Stoker's Dracula was done much better than this movie."
3,A bad wolfman and a good one,"In this film that casts mainly British actors, it is still puzzling to me how Benicio DelToro gets to play a lead role. ""Wolfman"" starts with a horrifying scene of a beast killing a young man in a forest. As it turns out that young man is Benicio's character's brother. It is the grieving fiancee (Emily Blunt) that gets in a picture when she asks for help in finding her fiancee's killer.Film does not have particularly strong special effects. Anthony Hopkins look more bored that scary as a wolfman. He is ruthless in a sense that is his willing to sacrifice his entire family for his need to kill.It is a so-so movie, fine entertaiment but nothing too deep."
2,Boring,"I was fortunate enough to be sort of a captive audience for this movie. I watched it on a Trans Pacific Flight. Glad I did in the sense that I didn't pay to view it and fortunately didn't buy it. I thought about buying the Blu Ray version sight unseen a couple of days before the trip but had second thoughts. Glad I didn't buy the DVD. The plot was to slow and tedious the special effects were good and of course HD enhances that.An American Werewolf in London and the follow on An American Werewolf in Paris were both much better, the original with Lon Chaney was also very good when compared to this film. Some people did like the film and that is what makes the world go around, others including myself didn't like the movie."
2,Boooooooring,"In recent years there have been a lot of horror re-makes. I have liked some, but most should have been left alone in my opinion, the original being far superior. I waited for Wolfman with great anticipation to come out on DVD (I never go to the theater) and to sum up the film in two words; predictable and dull. Watching this movie is like watching paint dry on a wall. I was able to guess what the characters were about to say and what they were about to do. I only gave it two stars because of Anthony Hopkins which is about the only redeeming quality of the whole thing. I am very glad I only spent the $4.00 to rent this one and that I didn't buy it."
3,A Fairly Decent Remake!!!,"I thought this was a pretty good tribute to the classic 1941 original. Some parts seemed kind of boring and you just wanted Lawrence to turn into the Wolfman. Benicio del Toro was a perfect choice for Lawrence Talbot because he reminds me a lot of Lon Chaney Jr. When his brother Ben, is missing, Lawrence returns to his home town to investigate what happened. While visiting some gypsies, a werewolf comes and wreaks havoc. Lawrence is bit and slowly becomes one also. He tries to hide from Inspector Francis Aberline and seeks help from Gwen, his brother's fiancée. I loved when Lawrence turned into the Wolfman, because that's what it's all about. I loved the gory death scenes. If you love the original classic, maybe you'll love THE WOLFMAN!!!"
1,Pass it up!,Way more graphic than it needed to be. Slow storyline. I had been wanting to see the movie for a long time - but was very disappointed!
1,"Benicio ""Way-Overrated"" Del Toro","A mechanical script, an unimaginitive director, and a deplorably monotone performance by the miscast Del Toro.Our first view of Del Toro in this film is of him doing what is certainly the worst reading of Shakespear ever in the history of the world. I literally thought it was some kind of sardonic joke the character was playing; but no, that was actually Del Toro attempting to act. Unfortunately for those of us who sat through this film, it only got worse from there. Somebody please tell Benecio that there is more to acting than merely reading aloud! (Or at least ask him to be awake the next time he gets in front of a camera.)Pewwww, what a stinker!"
3,"Pretty pictures, great execution, no emotions","Very atmospheric. Great lighting, shots, locations. Script/directing didn't made me care one way or another for the characters. If you don't care for them, hate them, or want to root for a character, or feel protective of them, want love to blossom, to savor bitter revenge on those that deserve it...it's just an unenvolving ride. Any emotions in this film just lay flat. We should be afraid of the Wolfman, but leavened with pity...as he is an innocent victem. Things happen, and I feel barely a nudge in the storytellers craft to get us involved. It's a handsome film, well made, but doesn't draw you in."
4,Howling Good Fun,"OK, I know, the story's a little hairy but if you're a sucker for a good werewolf flick this IS the movie for you. We've all heard the bad reviews so I won't revisit those (some are valid). This film is visually sumptuous and the werewolf transformations are top notch (Del Toro is halfway there anyway). Lets just say the relationship between Lawrence and Gwen was doomed from the beginning because she didn't like the pack that he ran with. Gotta go, I'm gonna go wolf down a burger...rare."
2,"It ain't a werewolf! It's a ""wolf man."" Disappointing!",Yet to see a movie that shows believable werewolf transformation that will surpass An American Werewolf in London and the Howling. The werewolf in this movie is insulting to people suffering with hypertrichosis (werewolf syndrome) and thus enabling further mockery and fear to those suffering the afore mentioned syndrome. A modern movie made in a high tech world with such a poorly created werewolf.
2,wolf man finally killed,Tha Wolfman and Silver Bullit had alot more exciting bits than this movie. Waited 6 months for its release and now which they would rate it with all B movies. No paulse changing action in this on. definitely PG.
3,"haven't gotten it to work yet, but I'm sure it's fun","I thought I did plenty of research before buying this game, but it turns out I'll probably never play it on this computer. Unfortunately some of the system requirements you only learn after actually reading the imbeded 'read me' text on the game disk, after spending all day installing it to realize it won't run. I don't blame the game, I'm sure it's awesome, I just wish I could play it..."
3,Colin McRae 2005,Game will not work with my Logitech Momo driving wheel. Can ONLY use a joystick. Verry unhappy---period
2,Too disturbing for me!,"the acting was very good but i really don't see why they made this movie!All it does is make you uncomfortarble and have nightmares for the next whole week.The movie makes you feel Madeliene Stowe's pain (and for me that's not very good) th plot is very weak,there is basically no point for this movie to have been made.What's even more surprising is that Ron Howard and Brian Grazer were brave enough to be the executive producers for this movie.I can see why this movie got bad reviews!I will admit that this movie is good in some catergories but they just don't stand out in this film!"
2,Closet Land - Let it stay in the closet,"I'm a die hard Alan Rickman fan, BUT this movie is extremely disturbing to watch. I won't deny that the acting is good, considering the storyline. But it is VERY hard to watch. The suggestion of torture and how the interrogator plays with his *victim* just made my skin crawl. I wish I had rented it first instead of purchasing it. I watched it once and immediately sold it to someone else. Just FYI. Rent it before you purchase it."
5,WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?,"Nobody and I mean Nobody has yet managed to match or exceed the joie de vivre and taste that was exhibited by the two late and much-beloved Pierres of Pierre Deux. Pierre Moulin and Pierre LeVec were the two most knowledgeable, gentlemanly, modest, sophisticated and informed antiquarians and observers of French design that we have yet seen. This and their other books will remain classics for years to come."
1,reprehensibly bad,"I'll try not say anything too disruptive. (Nevertheless, an official range of love it to hate it seems to say it's more than okay to just let the emotions rip.) This is just the sort of technical history that William Berkson would call out as ""a pack of lies."" For a much more historically accurate and far less shallow take on this topic, i highly recommendA History of Mathematics: From Mesopotamia to Modernity(Also why in the world would Mathematical Review ever publish a review of Hodgkin's book by Katz?!?! When I read Katz's review of Hodgkin, I felt immediatly uncomfortable since there is the very real possibility of Katz having the motivation to do all in his power to rid the marketplace of any competitor.)"
2,"a good history book, a bad mathematics book","there have been glowing reviews for this text but i do not think they accurately reflect the book in its entirety. that is to say, that yes, as a history book, this is a good reference book with a lot of information. however, as a book to teach students about mathematics, it falls far from even being decent. the text is poorly laid out, often fudging the exactness of crucial definitions, with the finer details being left to the reader to figure out in each chapters example problems. the chapter problems in general require a much greater of mathematics than the book is willing to give and do not build very well upon one another. good for reading about the history, but if you're trying to learn the math behind it, you may just wind up very, very frustrated."
3,Great Book/Great for Preparation for Registry,I bought this book to prepare for the registry it helped me in so many ways. Some of the questions in this book were identical on the test. Couldn't have passed without it.
2,For Classroom Use,"The sound was low and slightly hard to understand. However, the information is good and well thought out. If you are looking for a good video to show your kids and keep their interest...this is not it. Plenty of people can disagree and that's fine. Most of my classes were asleep in ten minutes or less. I personally liked the stance taken and point of view. The information contained is excellent."
1,"Only if you are a Mock Disciple, like me,","you should get this. I was suprised that this was beneath my expectations because anything by Don, whether it be video or book, has been superb. This book on octaves is really for beginners at best. If you know nothing about octave playing, this book is for you. Other than that, guitar players should stick to transcribing their favorite player for octave ideas.Anything by Don Mock is GOLD...except for this one."
4,Junky switch + Great light = One Heck of a Problem,It's true (as many before me have said) that the switch is pure hell. Flickering everytime I turn it on. Sometimes the light seems very dim until I mess with the switch and realize it's just not 'contacting' well.The problem is I LOVE the light. I'm too stupid and cheap to throw it away. So I continue on and suffer every night (since I usually use it as a reading light).Go ahead and buy it. It's nice. It's blue and the light it great. But you've been warned about that darn switch...
5,Great Shelf,"It's a great shelf, instructions are better than anything I'd expected. EAch shelf holds 100 lbs! The template you put up for drilling is brilliant, pretty tough to screw this one up. Takes a bit of tinkering to get the shelves adjusted evenly but not really that much of an issue. Looks fantastic on the wall too."
4,"Nice Shelves BUT,,,,",I mounted a pair of these shelves under each other. I love the shelves overall however be advised the channel for routing wires in is very small and many common plug end will not fit. You mayeed to cut wires and put on new plug ends. This is the only negative - other than this these are very nice and well made.
1,Don't chop 'Where The Streets...',"Like many of the other reviews, I don't agree with the track listing, as well. Four songs from 'Rattle And Hum' are too many, and the albums 'Boy' and 'October' are completely under-represented. The new single, 'The Sweetest Thing' is thoroughly disposable; it sounds like filler. And I despise the edited version of 'Where The Streets Have No Name'. This is the song that got me into U2 in the first place, and I believe the guitar lead-in and the matching guitar fade-out at the end are the most magnificent guitar pieces The Edge has played in any of U2's music. To cut both ends of the song short like the edit version does is nothing short of a tragedy. Usually, you would recommend a greatest hits collection to a friend who was just starting to get into a group, as an introduction to their music. I would not, however, recommend this collection. It is not a true representation of the beauty and brilliance that is U2."
4,If you love U2,"I am late to U2 fandom. And even now I really only like the 1980's U2, but if you like U2 from the 1980's this is the CD for you. All the songs from Rattle & Hum and a few I had never heard before. The best of U2 all on one CD."
4,The depths and the hights,"I am new to the whole U2 thing, and so, being the conscience consumer that I am, read a few reviews. Most seasoned U2 listeners have a problem with the jumping around that happens in this CD, saying that it has no common theme. What I would like to say about this is that common themes are boring. For me, this album lets me think about the lowest and the highest and the feelings in between. To me it is a constant building on the songs that came before. To make someone feel such a range of emotions in such a short time takes a lot of talent and passion. In a way, I would say that it is like a catharsis: I find myself crying and laughing at the same time."
4,The Very Best of U2,"I always liked U2's music, but was never able to find one album which would give me more than two or three good songs. Well, there it is. I've waited many years for this one. Not only does it regroup the band's best material, but it regroups what I think is some of the best the 80's gave us musically. Why 4 stars then? Because once again, one can find some songs which are not that good (like Sweetest Thing). That's also the reason I didn't buy the limited double album edition. I only wanted ""the best"". And the best is most of what one will get with this excellent CD."
1,It has songs!!,"I mean, wow! This really deserves a star as they actually managed to put SONGS on this cd! That must've been a really hard job for the compilers to do so, -phew-!!"
1,YOU CALL THIS A GREATEST HITS?,"LOOK, I CAN PLAY EVERY U2 SONG EVER AND THEY ARE EASILLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS. BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY THE RECORD LABEL LIES AND CLAIMS THIS ALBUM IS U2'S GREATEST HITS. THE SONGS ARE SHORTENED!!! WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO? HOW CAN A LABEL RELEASE SHORTENED VERSIONS OF GREAT SONGS ON A GREATEST HITS ALBUM--WHAT A SCAM! DON'T LET YOURSELF BE SCAMED TOO. DON'T BUY THIS CD. BUY THE ORIGINAL ALBUMS TO HEAR WHAT THE BAND REALLY WANTED YOU TO HEAR. HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG, U2 WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OF THE 19TH CENTURY."
4,"Great compilation, but...","...it's still missing some songs, some tracks are single edits, and the tracks are in a non-chronological sequence. Here's what should have been:1. I Will Follow2. Gloria3. New Year's Day4. Sunday Bloody Sunday5. Two Hearts Beat As One6. Pride (In The Name Of Love)7. The Unforgettable Fire8. Bad9. Where The Streets Have No Name10. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For11. With Or Without You12. Bullet The Blue Sky13. In God's Country14. The Sweetest Thing (Single Mix)15. Desire16. When Love Comes To Town17. Angel Of Harlem18. All I Want Is You"
3,U2 - 'The Best Of 1980 - 1990' (Island),"An okay fourteen track compilation(should've been at least two more songs here)of U2's prime/radio friendly material from the Irish supergroup's first ten years.Starting with ""I Will Follow""(although this tune shows up halfway thru),""Sunday Bloody Sunday"",""New Year's Day"",""Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"",""Angel Of Harlem"",""Desire"" and so on.Casual U2 fans may get more out of this than the huge-timers."
4,A good U2 primer,"U2 was one of the biggest names in rock 'n roll in the 1980's, and this album wraps up the essence of that decade into one package. Some of U2's most recognizable songs are to be found right in here. This album presents the classic U2 that is sorely missing these days; the energetic no-fear type of style, the unmistakable voice of Bono (one of my favorite voices anywhere in the rock world), and the trademark U2 songwriting.My rating of 4 reflects my general feelings toward U2's music - like it but not get too excited about. One catch - the early 1990's songs from Achtung Baby should have also been included. If this album was strictly a 1980's collection, then why wait until late 1998 to release it?"
4,Fantastic!,"This is such a great cd! I suggest it to anyone who has good taste in music! But some of the songs that i listen to on it are slightly boring, SO BEWARE!!! (heheh)"
3,"nice, but incomplete","i have been a fan of u2 since i first saw the video for pride way back in 1985 or whatever it was. since then i have made sure to get every major release that they ever put out and i have loved every one of them. this is mearly an ok collection. it is seriously missing some very important songs. unlike most greatest hits collections that are missing 3-4 songs, this one is missing about half of what should have been on here. it is so bad that i made a 3rd disc of all the missing songs. they should have made it a 2 disc set. you're better off making your own collection."
3,"A good but rusty, & shoddily assembled collection.","This collection of 14 tracks from U2's 80s heyday, musically speaking, is a great collection of U2 songs, but however, this collection is not worth the fortune on the import version and don't be fooled by the bonus track, it's just an extra track.The 2-CD on the other hand with the B-Sides disc is absolutely priceless. All of the 15 B-Sides on that edition are priceless musical gems that must not be missed.The only thing new that this single disc edition offers is the 'new' song ""Sweetest Thing"" which is a re-recording of a B-Side and the newer version can be found on the double album version and the older version on the B-Sides CD.If you want this collection, go for the 2 CD version but this import edition is not worth the fortune compared to the worthy price of the domestic edition of the 2-CD edition."
2,TERRIBLE OVERVIEW,"How can we have a cohesive overview when a whole LP (October) is practically ignored?? (The title song reduced to a 'hidden' track). I'm thinking that ""Gloria"", the non LP ""Celebration"", and other worthy contenders were left off so we have to buy the inevitable box set. Shame on U, U2."
2,From A Newbie,"Having never heard a U2 song before, I bought this album simply for its ""historical significance"" to the music industry. I was both surprised and dissapointed at its content.""Pride"" sounds like something out of a nursery rhyme,but it grew on me after a while. ""New Year's Day"" and ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" rank as two of my favorite songs ever. And I thought ""I still haven't found what i'm looking for"" and ""Where the streets have no name"" were dandy, but that was pretty much the end of the surprises.""Bad"", ""The Unforgettable Fire"", and ""I will Follow"" are three of the worst songs I've heard. The last four songs sound like used car advertisments.Verdict: Buy ""The Joshua Tree"", and possibly ""War"" because the rest of this CD, besides ""Sweetest Thing"", is crap."
2,commercial mess,"Still in shock I gave it 2 stars - this release should have been much bigger - Boy, War, UF are in of themselves a ""Best of"" and slightly under represented in my humble opinion - if you like Joshua and post release material this pup's for you otherwise if you're younger than 28 you probably have no idea what the heck I'm talkin about - don't waste your money - go out and buy the real deal - I'll wait for the boxset I guess..."
4,"WONDERFUL, ABSOLUTELY! EVEN THOUGH.....","I WAS WORRIED BY THE RELEASE OF A GREATEST HITS ALBUM. ISN'T THIS WHAT BANDS DO (GASP!)...AT THE END? BUT OF COURSE U2 ARE IMMORTAL, LIKE THE STONES, ONLY BETTER. WONDERFUL SONGS LIKE ""PRIDE"", ""SUNDAY.."", ""BAD"", ""WITH OR WITHOUT YOU"", ""I WILL FOLLOW"", ""I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND"" AND ""DESIRE"" PAINT THE ALBUM A BEAUTIFUL SHADE OF NOSTALGIA. BUT WHAT OF THE RAPING OF ""NEW YEAR'S DAY""? LEAVING OUT A FULL LYRIC! AND SHORTENING ""WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME""? THIS IS SACRILEGE! AND DEAR ""GLORIA"", WHERE IS SHE?! BUT ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR THOSE WHO FOUND THE SECRET SONG AT THE END OF TRACK 14....THANK YOU, U2, ISLAND RECORDS, FOR A POIGNANT CLIP OF ""OCTOBER"". FANS, NEVER UNDER-ESTIMATE A U2 ALBUM. THIS ONE'S NOT PERFECT, BUT A MUST FOR THE DIE HARD FANS."
4,A compilation to get a new Generation hooked...,"I am an avid fan of U2 and own all the LP's including most single CD's. This Best of is not for me. But...for those of you just discovering U2 for the first time, you must begin with this disc. Then move on to each CD itself. The difference between U2 and the bands of today is that U2's best songs were never released as singles or played much on the radio. You'll find them all in the heart of each album and as B-sides to their singles. Consider this a starter kit, then discover later, Boy, October, War and Unforgettable Fire (their 4 best)."
4,A few good selections for casual fans...,"There are quite a few good selections on this album, and it makes for a nice collection for those who are casual fans of U2, or you're like me (a fan who's trying to find all of the really nice early songs) but those who live and breathe U2 won't find anything here, except possibly the lack of some favorite tracks. (In such a case I direct you to the Limited Edition version of this album, with all the B-Sides...)"
5,This is now one of my favorite CDs,"About this time last year, I was not a really big U2 fan. Cool music, but I can't say I was really passionate about it. About a week ago, though, my mind was changed by their performance at halftime for the 2002 Super Bowl. I got out this CD and listened to it again, especially the song ""Where the Streets Have No Name."" I revised my opinion of U2 because of that. Now I think they are the coolest band ever!!!!!!!!!This album is one of the greatest ""Best of. . ."" collections ever. (And I am a big fan of ""Best of. . . "" collections!) In my opinion, this album is seamless-all the songs fit together-if you pay careful attention to the lyrics. Besides, I just LOVE the guitar riffs!"
2,"a typical ""greatest hits"" blunder","Are you kidding me? Four songs from Rattle and Hum? Yeah, that album was deserving(?). First of all, U2's music should be divided into four categories: (1) pre-Joshua tree--all of which kicked ass; (2) Joshua tree--probably their best album, but transitional in its sound; (3) Rattle and Suck--no explanation, assorted good songs and some crap; (4) and everything since--""hey guys, check out this synthesizer and drum machine I found . . ."" All albums up to and including Unforgettable Fire deserve their own, more comprehensive greatest hits album. By the way, kids who grew up on ""new U2"" know nothing."
1,Unforegivable!,"I agree with many of the previous reviewers - producing a greatest hits CD of a great band - and using shortened versions of the original songs is simply unforegivable! You have one chance to do the CD right - and in this case, the publisher blew it - big time. Definitely the most disappointing greatest hits CD I have ever bought. Do not buy this CD."
2,The original recordings are better,"I usually would not take the time to review something I was not all that enthusiastic about, but as an ardent U2 fan I felt obliged to inform the potential buyer of the flaws of this CD. My main problem is that the producers mess with the originals to the point of irritating the listener (i.e., me): a whole verse of ""New Years Day"" is chopped out, the beginning and end of ""Where the Streets have no name"" are shortened, a section of Bad is missing. These things irritate those of us who know and have loved this music for almost twenty years. I also don't think the inclusion of four songs from R and H was justified. One surprise - ""October"" appears unannounced at the end. Anyway, buy the originals. They're all worthy of five stars."
3,This album shows how far U2 have come.,"The 80's wasn't a great time for music. U2 certainly stood out from the dross. It's easy to be nostalgic but hard to argue that much of this stuff measures up to their most recent work, particularly their masterpiece Achtung Baby (if you call the early 90's recent).The choice of tracks is odd. Sweetest Thing is a bad joke and the Rattle And Hum era must embarrass U2. I suspect Bono wakes up in a sweat every second night. However the first 6 or so tracks capture nicely what made the band so popular - the energy and passion and earnestness which contrast so strongly to the cynical self referential Pop and Zooropa."
4,"O melhor, dentro do possível.","Definitivamente esta no é a coletnea que eu esperava, más se fossem colocadas todas as músicas que mereciam ser postas em um CD do U2, este teria que ser em uma caixa com pelo menos 5 CD's."
3,very short,"i am really disappointed. There are only 5 tracks to isten. The five first ones. After, it is not really good. The mix is strange on Sunday Bloody Sunday (no Bono s queer cry at the beginning) U2 loves money but a few tracks are still amazing, so..."
1,in search of the lost U2.,"what happened to the 'lads' i knew so well? with such innocense they penned the songs to 'war','october',etc. they have become parodies of themselves and have left the path they chose early on to waddle aimlessly and helplessly down the path to who knows where. with each album i hear a 'cry' from within saying 'release me from my prison' yet no one comes to let them out. alas, poor bono, i knew him well!"
3,all the best they've done during those ten years,this cd was good..but id prefer listening to my other cd such as my favorite..CANDYASS by orgy.
4,"Not bad, but it's incomplete.","Is U2 the greatest band in the world? They could very well be, and this collection is a nice survey of their work for the first ten years of the band's recording career. We're treated to the hits: ""Pride,"" ""With or Without You,"" ""Sunday Bloody Sunday,"" ""Desire"" and so on. These songs have aged gracefully and still hold up well. Yet, more discriminating fans will note that this collection is somewhat incomplete. Where, pray tell, is ""Gloria,"" one of the most important tracks from their early recording years? ""In God's Country"" wasn't as big a hit as, say, ""Where the Streets...,"" but it was nonetheless one of the stronger cuts off the ""Joshua Tree"" album. Unfortunately, that song, too, is missing. That gripe aside, I still recommend this disc. The early editon had a bonus disc of b-sides and rarities. If you can find a copy, you should get your hands on one. Otherwise, this single-disc edition will do."
3,Best of Bikini Style,"It's hard to imagine a best of U2 collection (even if it does focus on just the 80s) on only one CD. I would have expected a set of two CDs, at the least. Although this is a good overview of the band's 80s material, there are just two many memorable tunes left out."
5,A great classic rock compilation,U2 are amongst the greatest rock bands of all time and rightfully deserved the acollades and awards.ignore the one star reviews and get this today.five stars.
1,Used to be big U2 fan,I won't forget when Bono trashed their old classic rock when they released pop... seems to me that the old stuff was what really made money ... as U2 seem to have suddenly remembered
1,I knew it!!!!!!!!!!!!,I always knew U2 sucks!!! A friend of mine who is a huge fan of U2 and she kept on pushing me to listen to it and once I listened and I was like WTF is this??? and she kept telling me that U2 are always the best but I knew U2 is horrible!!! I believe she was trying to make me buy all of their albums so she could be able to get it from me for FREE but I am not that dumb!!! I told her we all cant have the SAME taste of music we all are different and we all have our own taste. So sorry friend I rate this 1 STAR!!! and yeah I have a message for U2: get lost!!! you guys are not worth to be a singer!!! You guys are terrible!!! You guys dont work too hard for this BS!!! *throw up*
1,U2 sucks,"Who the hell is the kid on half of their lame album covers. Bono is a retard, U2 sucks, and the songs on this album proves it and shows how ""rock"" they are."
1,U2 SUCKS!!!,"U2 is one of the very worst bands of all time along with the Doors, Queen, Rolling Stones and Black Sabbath. All their albums and songs are pure rubbish!! Bono has got to be some of the worst singers ever!! Don't buy this CD as you will be wasting your money. U2 SHOULD BE DISHONORED FOR MAKING SUCH AWFUL MUSIC."
3,Where is Gloria? An exercise in ax grinding,"Man, this album bugs me. Not that the songs aren't great (they are) and not because there are some understandable omissions (great bands are never able to fit all the deserving songs on a single disc). This album gets under my skin because they completely ignore the October record.When U2 were building their US fan base in the early 80's, MTV played the heck out of Gloria; it was a great song. The whole October album is pretty darned good and to pretend it never existed is baffling. When you remember that this collection was originally released as a double CD with a second disc of B-sides, it just adds insult to injury."
5,wha!?,"I bought the 2CD version of this collection for much less here in Amazon, WITH the B-Sides, don't get fooled this is not the 2CD collection it is only the original (just imported). It may be imported but not worth all that much more!However the ""limited"" version 2CD (which I posted a review to it) it's really worth every penny and it's beautiful. Shouldn't be left out of any U2 collection. The B-Sides itself is priceless."
1,Warning : The Best Songs have been Edited!!!,"The best songs are edited, presumably so that you'll go out and by the original CD's. They sound like something the publishers would put on Kazaa to discourage pirating. Ridiculous!It's really not fair to put out edited versions without saying so on the cover."
4,"If you only know and like one of their songs, you'll like this album",I knew about half the songs on the album when I bought it. Now I know and like most of them. I'd definitely buy it again.
4,My wife likes the album,"Says it has all the good songs on it, from those years of course. I'm not a big fan, bought no complaints, it is what it is."
3,Review of cd ordered,"The CD, thank goodness, sounds fine. But it was advertised as new and was not. The plastic wrap was off, and the case was worn. I played the CD to make sure it was OK, and when it played alright, I decided not to return it because I needed it for a project."
3,Don't waste your money on this!,"This is just a badly put together collection that offers little in the way of anything new except for a 'new' song ""Sweetest Thing"" which I find to be relatively dull in comparison to much of U2's other work. The shortening of many of the songs ruins them completely and there is room for at least four more full-length songs. This collection is great musically but they really squandered their chance of making an excellent collection. The B-Sides edition though is much better but they should've released those B-Sides on a separate album! Don't waste your money on this useless collection. Get their albums instead"
4,Very Solid Machine,"Set up took roughly 2 hours with very little problems. There was only one missing screw that was not important (had my own replacement). Very solid construction. My wife and I have been using for the last two months and no problems to report. Slight squeeking sound after first couple of uses, but nothing too annoying. If you listen to music or watch TV you wont even notice it. The electronic center has a nice variety of training programs plus a fan that works well enough. Overall very happy with this purchase, especially for the price."
3,Acceptable but less than described.,".....I purchased this particular set of drill bits because they are branded (Neiko) and featured a split point design for self piloting into the work piece. What I recieved was generic Chinese specials that I could have bought for less elsewhere on Amazon. Now either Neiko has that design feature in its product or not is undertermined by me and may be a vender mistake, but shop by price and not by description of these drills. As far as use of these value bits, they are fine for homeowner/ hobby use and the smaller numbered bits are fragile when drilling in brass and would recommend colbalt and a lighter hand for your smaller detailed work!"
1,Dancing in the Dark: The Shadow Side of Intimate Relationshi,"This is NOT a clinical book. I found I lost interest after a few pages, and also after browsing the chapters. The Moseleys talk about their relationship ad nauseum, and generalize these tales to their readers. Sorry folks, regurgitating your own path does not help most people, but it does sway them to buy books..."
5,Very helpful in uncovering deeper dynamics of relationships,"This book shed light on patterns that I have been acting out but couldn't see with an objective perspective, particularly the parent/child dynamic. I am sure that I will be noticing these patterns much sooner now. This book also provided significant insight into how I have been sabotaging relationships by my aversion to anger and how this has restricted the flow of energy in my life. While no book can fix anything, this one sure has me exploring parts of myself that I wasn't looking at earlier. Maybe I will be a better dance partner now."
5,A great acoustic concert,"For those of you who don`t know these two musicians, Clive Nolan (regular keyboard player in Pendragon (1986 - current), Shadowland (1992 - 1996), Strangers on a Train (1993 - 1994) and Arena (1995 - current), and Nick Barrett (singer of Pendragon)are two great artists well known in the progressive music world. Here they show a great gig stripped of everything except the keyboards and an electric guitar. If you want to see and listen to an intimate performance, then here is your chance."
4,Great start!,"Books gives an excellent beggining point for one who would like to begin writing for the newpaper. If one reads this book and reads news articles with it, one should be able to understan newspaper format.I recomend this book for all who are interested in either writing in the future or in understanding the news article format. After taking a class with a college proffesor using this book I was able to get an article published in the college paper."
3,Replacement for Nioxin,Nioxin was sold and is now being manufactured in Mexico. The mixture has changed and doesn't work as before. Looking for replacement product. Therapy-G is ok not the same as Nioxin.
3,Worked for the other half,"Did not work for me but worked for wife though. Saw a lot more of my hair washed away than previous regular shampoo. For wife, she said it was good for her dandruff. For me, felt too tingly for my preference. Wife says she don't feel tingliness of the shampoo. 2.5 stars."
3,"A Nice Shampoo, But it Won't Put Hair Back on Your Head",It feels like it cleans your hair and scalp quite well and leaves what hair you might have full bodied. I wasn't expecting any more and didn't get it. At the same time I've only been using it for several months.
3,Meh.,"I've been using this for about a month and honestly can't tell a difference in my actual hair. It seems to make it a bit thicker if you don't use conditioner, but I think I was hoping for it to somehow make my hair grow back. I guess I will have to spend a ton more money on something else in order to get that. I do ADORE the smell of this though. It's the best smelling shampoo I've ever had, and it does make my scalp tingle a bit with the mint part of it. I just can't tell a difference in my hair. :/"
4,"I admit to being a bit biased,","Miriam was our tour guide a couple weeks back in Israel and I know her to be very knowledgeable about the country, it's history, archeology, etc.. The book is well titled and gives a good basic understanding of life back then. Especially helpful in one's understanding of the Bible and why Jesus did the things he did and said things the way they were. Puts it in context. Such a small book can't be highly comprehensive, though if you're interested in the Herods it is quite so. It does pack a lot of information in a small package. The illustrations by the former Russian lacquer box painter, are very nice, representative and helpful. Not a children's book, highly recommended to anyone with any interest in the country, the times, our Lord and Savior, Jesus."
5,Daily LIfe at the Time of Jesus...,"""Daily LIfe at the Time of Jesus"".....is about Jesus and where he walked. I had purchased an autographed copy of this book in Israel and wanted another copy for the grandchildren. I highly recommend the book for all ages."
2,Too little too many,"I love to look at picture books and use my imagination, but there has to be more information and a theme or plot to get my interest. Book is too small, illustrations are good but leaves too much for the imagination. It was created to sell, do not expect a revelation or a true meaning for the book. I supposed that you can let your imagination fill in the missing chapters. I say it is not worth the money but to some it is worth every penny. It all depends on what you want the book to say. It is hard to say not to buy it but think before you do."
4,service,"this item was as ordered, as described; well packed; fast delivery; and I would definitely purchase again from this seller."
4,"HEY, TRUE PROOF THAT TRUE CHRISTMASES GOTTA HAVE SOUL",now i was not too hip on this one until my mind grew and became more open. my two faves on this one is LET'S MAKE THIS CHRISTMAS MEAN SOMETHING THIS YEAR and SOUND OF CHRISTMAS. i go absolutely INSANE when these joints play within my vibe doggone!!!! they almost NEVER play his christmas stuff on the radio where i am. AN INJUSTICE!!!!!
3,Not Christmas-y enough,"not very Christmasy and too much screaming for Christmas music, but I should have expected that from James Brown. good sound technically."
5,Let's make this christmas Funky!,"I've owned this for over 10 years and it is definitely one of my favorite christmas albums. In my opinion, the best song on the album is 'Let's make this Christmas mean something this year', the message of the song is timeless and I love the background singers on this track.There are some fun and funky tracks as well as some beautiful soulful songs too. This is not your traditional christmas fare, but they are certainly classics in their own right. Highly recommend to any fans of James Brown."
5,Right On for James Brown,"God, I love this album. Like some of my fellow reveiwers, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it at first, and didn't play it too much for a time. However, on the second round, I got completely hooked. It has such a great blend of deep soul, as well as outright cheer, that it's incredibly catchy. When I first started to ""get"" it, I was floored by the orchestration and musicality, and then, upon second glance, I was amazed by the messages James Brown puts across. Very eye-opening. Now, this is ALWAYS on the shuffler at my Christmas parties, and very often during summer picnics, too. It shouldn't fall under any category - it's completely playable year-round. I love it, love it, love it. Don't know how to put it better."
5,Emerging Voices,"Very well written, thought provoking stories.The art work was wonderful and added the story line,allowing you to interrupt it's meaning in your own way.For all you love short stories this book is a must."
3,Ok for my project,"Good hoop, but a little off center. I only needed it for hangling fabric in art project, so it disn't end up being a problem."
2,Flimsy hoop,"I was disappointed in the flimsiness of this hoop. I guess it would be okay for framing a completed project, but not strong enough to hold a quilt as you are working on it. The wood wedges seem to be set too far apart and make it impossible to tighten the hoop sufficient to hold the quilt securely. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Great for emergency prep or camping!,"No matter if you are backpacking, boating, camping or just putting food away for an emergency, these are a tasty meal! I was a little skeptical about freeze dried foods until I tried them! Order one and you will be back for more (if you can find any) - there seems to be a shortage at the moment not surprising given the conditions in the world today."
5,Not bad,Not the best spaghetti in the world but it works. Would get you threw an emergency. Would make great bug out food.
3,Not bad...good for gadget freaks,"Covering a range of interesting gadgets, techniques and gizmos for the syy trade, this book does a decent job giving up-to-date coverage of some of the ways the CIA and other spy agencies have collected information over the years. It is filled with good pictures and descriptions, but short, I think on some of the newer items, which, I am guessing remain classified."
2,CIA Catalog of Clandestine Weapons,Very little information that I could use. Zig-saw blade and a pair of glasses was not what I was expecting.Very little information on chemical weapons.I suppose I picked the wrong book.
3,"Encouraging ideas, but skip first chapters!","Maybe it is because I am from the modest culture of the Netherlands, but I think Rita has overdone in praising her own methods. I already bought the book! Still, in later chapters, I found a lot of usefull ideas, especially those about GIVING AWAY YOUR TIME. That is one of my weak spots and she really made me aware of it. TIME is a person's most valuable asset."
1,I bought 10 package's of Cookie's every single cookie was broke,The packaging on these cookies WAS HORRIBLE. they sent in a box that was to big so the cookies were flying all over in the box. They didn't even bother taking out of the original box even though it was half empty. Look's like a 2 year old packed it. WHAT A JOKE!!!!
2,What is going on here?,"I love these cookies. NO....I REALLY love them. So...why is the price going up. My first order, $35. My next $41. Now it is $49? I know it comes from different retailers but this link is the only one for the 10 cookies, package of 32. Hm...When the holidays die down, I will get them from CVS because the price stays at $2.99 per package. So great cookie. GREAT...but hiking the price up....not nice."
3,Barely satisfied by packaging,"Received the pack today and found out that the panel of the box was almost completely open (more than wide enough to allow someone to add of remove items). All the packs seems to be there, though. I am not sure why and how it happened, but I REALLY don't like. Taste is very good"
3,Addictive Cookies,"I love these cookies, the first time I had then was on a plane. They are addictive do I was glad to find them on line. But I had to buy a lot of packages at once and many of the packages contain mostly broken cookies."
2,Cookies are good but packaging sucks!,"I first tried this cookie on a Delta flight. I really liked it. After i returned back from the trip, I ordered these cooking online. I was eagerly waiting for them to arrive. But when they came, 50% of the cookies were broken into small pieces. I would probably never order online unless they improve the packaging."
2,Packaging Problem,"I first tried the biscoff cookies on my way to New Orleans. AirTran was serving these as snacks for the travelers. I liked it so much that I decided to order a family size from the Biscoff company. Unfortunately, when they arrived I noticed that most of the cookies were cracked, chipped, essentially crumbled into pieces. Why wouldn't it be when the cookies were just packed in a weak wrapper/packaging box and had been tossed around during the period of shipment?I'm fairly disappointed that I wasted my money on a bunch of destroyed cookies."
1,This book has a empty feeling,"When I first picked this book up I thought it would offer insight into the dark world of police corruption. Well, I was wrong. This book only shows what one individual's thoughts and actions were at the time of their crimes. This book could have been excellent had it showed how corruption exists inside a police force in general. instead the author chose to write from an individual standpoint."
5,christmas traditions room spray discontinued,I am truly disappointed to the utmost for the discontinuation of christmas traditions room spray. PLEASE bring it back!!! I use it year round and receive compliments glore. People always ask where they can purchase it. If I were someone rich or important Im sure it would be brought back but Im not. Just a peon abd once satisfied customer.
2,Doesn't work at the crucial time,"I run outside during the winter when it's mostly dark when I get home from work. When this little light works, it's great. But shortly into the run, it starts flickering and sometimes goes completely out for a few seconds. Seeing as how it's new and it has new batteries, I am disappointed."
5,A must have.,"I have had this light for over a year and it is fantastic. I got it to take fishing. It is indispensible for operating in the early morning or night. What I have also found is that I reach for it constantly around the house (getting stuff from behind wahser/dryer, hooking up wires to stereo/computer, etc... I don't wear it for long periods and camping and fishing are not the most active sports, so I have not experienced the problems others have listed. My light does not flicker on and off uless the battery compartment is not sealed properly, and my battery life is great for my use. I had this light for 8+ months and I was curious about the batteries before a trip so I left it one for over 24 hours and it was still burning. I am about to buy the newer model with xtra led and more settings (low, med, high, & strobe) for my camping/fishng and put this one in the harware drawer!"
3,Good until you really need it,"It's great for reading in a tent and pitching a tent in the dark but it does flicker on and off and does not seem bright enought for hiking out in the dark. It seemed brighter when I first got it, but now it seems to eat batteries and it not bright enough for night hiking.The cord gets tangled in my long hair and the pad on the back of the lamp fell off."
4,Very good lamp for camping and not bad for book light,"I own 5 camping headlamps and have gone through at least that many booklights.This is a light, long-lasting camping light. It throws a lot of light close up. Its shortcoming is that the light does not illuminate distant objects as well.However, I bought this as a booklight (my wife cannot sleep with lights on) after going through many traditional booklights. This one works well. It is small, light. Only shortcoming. It throws off too much light! But I am keeping it!"
4,Powerful + Survived Blackout 2003,"Early this year, I was shopping for a mini book lamp. I had only two choices:1. Zelco ""itty bitty"" Book Light2. Petzel E44p Headlamp.Researched both products. Finally, decided Petzel E44P was the one for me based on reviews and the overall product specs . I purchased two Petzel headlamps and I'm happy that I made the right choice.Petzel:- Small, portable and powerful- Light, Stable, Comfortable and Powerful lamp- Handy Utility Lamp -- Night Reading - Excellent- Offer great lighting when you are working in a tight spot.- Petzel E44P became my essential survival tool during the GREAT Blackout 2003!- Pay more - Priceless for a Rock Solid Product- Battery Perfect Size- Powerful LED lamp vs. standard yellow light- Long Lasting battery - The batteries are over 6 months old and it is still going strong.Cons: Closing the battery lid was not easy.On/Off switch could be better."
2,has some problems with design,"I bought three of these and after having them in service nightly for two months by differant family members, we're all a bit disappointed with the design.First, they flicker, sometimes just go out intermittantly even with fresh batteries... Also, they drain power much more rapidly than advertised... after about 20 hours you'll see about a 50% drop in output that drops off rapidly after that. after 35 hours, the light has almost no throw. Even reading a paperback six incnes in front of your eyes is difficult.They are light and so far the retraction mechanisms have held up, but the negatives are disconcerting."
3,Nice Add on,"I bought this item to replace the stamped steel wings that I had on my table saw. It is good, not great. As others have said, it does not end up being square to the table. Also, although it says that it has holes that align up with existing holes on the fence rails - they don't on my Delta contractor saw."
4,Lollobrigida in top form,"THE LAW/WHERE THE HOT WIND BLOWS shows Gina Lollobrigida at 31, in top form both as a beautiful woman and as an actress. God, how gorgeous she was, and how hot, sensual, desirable is her Marietta! No wonder every man in town lusts after her! The whole cast is wonderful: Mastroianni, Mercouri, Montand, Stoppa and the great Pierre Brasseur. Jules Dassin's direction does justice to the Vailland novel, for the most part. It is urgent to restore this film and release it in DVD format with extras, including a competent critical commentary."
4,Beautiful to Behold,"Very good movie, particularly if you enjoy Jules Dassin or films set in Italy. Gina is pure pulchritude. Unfortunately, the bonus commentary is not merely vacuous but actually annoying."
1,This DVD has never been received. I am stll waitng..,"Hi,May I draw your attention to the fact, that none out the DVDs supposedly contained contained in this packakge could be reviewed, for the very simple reasen that this package never arrived. And it is still missing. Please start looking for it. I'll apprecriate it Thank. ALEX"
3,Not Worth the Price! Mediocre Performance,"This is NOT a review of the retailer. This is a review only of the Sony NH-14WM battery. I have owned five of these batteries over the past four years and I use them to power a Sony MZ-M100 Minidisc recorder. One I had to return right away as the positive side wasn't shaped correctly enough to fit the charger nor the equipment. Two of the four left burned out after a year of rotating, medium use (I was careful to fully charge and discharge each time so memory bands were not the issue). I now have two left and they lose 50% of their charge within a day. Of all the rechargeable batteries I own these perform the worst. It is frustrating when a company forces you to use an 'odd' shape battery and then charge almost a third of the cost of the equipment it powers...and then the product performs mediocre. Come on Sony give us a break!"
3,Looks well made...But....,"HAVE not installed this yet, it looks to be quality made....Unfortunately it is MADE IN CHINA. Time will tell if it lives up to the Bosch name."
3,Very Thorough But Biased Account Of Davis' Life,I appreciated the intricate details Spada provided in the telling of Davis' life story. What I could have done without were the implications that Davis caused the death of her husband as well as the brain damage from which her adopted daughter suffered! Apparently no accidents even peripherally connected with Davis can occur without making her bear the burdon of the blame. Is this amateur sleuthing or sensationalism or just mean-spiritedness? Makes you wonder if BD Hyman had a hand in the writing of this book.
1,Cut and Paste job disguised as a Biography,"This is one of the worst biographies I have ever read. Its a cut and paste job from other sources, particularly B.D. Hyman's ""My Mother's Keeper"". The book is full of factual errors such as saying that Davis won a Best Supporting Actress Emmy Award for ""Strangers, the Story of a Mother and Daughter"", when in actuality, Davis won the Emmy for Best Actress. The author makes every effort to portray Davis as a saint, B.D. as the enemy and then reverts to Davis as the enemy, B.D. as the saint and back and forth. This biography is inconsistent and documented very poorly."
5,"Real Brothas, iz right!","When I first heard Knocc Out & Dresta in Real Muthaphuckkin' G'z I was shock on how like Dresta's voice iz sweet and a deep gangsta voice and Knocc Out iz like E'z in a way. Dresta and Knocc out really do it on this one, too bad its outta print, the song ""Do or Die"" iz a hard soft westside gangsta song. I gotta say they blew up tha mid 90'z fo' awhile"
2,SURPRISINGLY WEAK,"these 2 guys made a name for themselves rapping on eazy e tracks. although neither of them are great MCs, and they only have limited vocabularies and subject matter, i was still anticipating a lot from their album.unfortunately the bass heavy tunes with great melodies this duo rapped on in their days with eazy e are not present. rhythm d (usually a pretty good producer) serves up a selection of extremely tired, uninspired 'grooves' which make the album a pretty dull listening experience.only on the last two tracks is there any good stuff. the eerie 'down goes another' and the snoop dis 'dpgk' does the music finally become entertaining. the flows stay the same throughout but obviosuly without the music underneath them there really isn't much their to listen to. overall this album is EXTREMELY WEAK.take it from me, i'm a big eazy e/ruthless records fan, but AVOID this album. its not worth your time or money getting it."
3,Not quite what the back cover leads you think,"So I started this thinking it might be about ghosts or fantasy worlds. Nope. Think old man's wandering thoughts. It's not BAD, but it's not great, either. There's a few small mysteries, a couple of which are cleared up, others that aren't. There are a few ghost/fairy tales, but they are told by people, not happening. The most fantastic world is that this old man is in a huge house (think Winchester Mystery House)and he can consult dead doctors about a stroke he's going to have. But mostly it's childhood reminiscing, with some adult memories, in that slightly depressing style popular at the time. It's a well-written book, the characters are complex and realistic. Just not much happens."
3,If only we could give half stars...,"I am a fan of Wolfe and I enjoyed the book, but unless you are already of fan of Gene Wolfe, I would suggest starting with ""Free, Live Free"" or the New Sun series.As a first novel it is an extraordinary work and most of his work compares with some of the greatest writers in the English language and that is the problem. Rossi's assesment of it being unreadable is as over the top as saying it should take a place on your shelf beside The Bard and Dickens, but for most readers it will be about as much fun as reading classic books for English Lit.I want you to give Wolfe a try, but start somewhere else and don't let fan club comments of the five star crowd push you into the deep end."
1,Disgusting waste of paper,I saw this book at B&N and I guess people WILL buy just about anything. Really gross and juvenile.
3,Works well after getting them turned,"This drum works very well. However, I had to take it to my local car shop to get them turned before they were true. I installed these directly out of the box and got a pulsing in my brake pedal (I have front disc brakes and rear drums...steering wheel doesn't shake while braking, just the pulsing in the brake pedal due to untrue rear brakes). I got these turned for 30 dollars (15 each) and after getting them turned, they worked perfectly. I do recommend these, just know that you will probably have to turn them first"
2,Insufficient Closed Captions,"Even though this film is advertised as embedded with closed captions, they are much too far and few between. In fact, the captions do not appear at all when the film's dialogue is in spoken English--which is 95 percent of the time. No subtitles provided either. Hence, the hearing imapired and others dependent on captions will be severely disadvantgaged and disappointed."
2,Not so much,This is for people who are interested in Bach and would like to listen to selections of his work. This is not for a lover of Bach who wants hours of deep listening.
5,A BACH LOVER!,I am in love with this CD; it offers all the pleasure you can ever hope for if you love Bach's work. I am enjoying it immensely. Thanks for the pleasure!
3,Bach for amateurs,"A good selection of the most popular works of J.S.Bach.Really suitable for non professional musicians or music lovers. The best tracks ,no doubt,are the ones of Glenn Gould,specially his performance of the Goldberg Variations aria. This recording can be improved with some others excerpts(the musical offering by G.Leonhardt for example or some other performance in period instrument)."
5,How Did I Live Without This?,"I've cooked chili, prepped mac and cheese (starting with a béchamel), and braised meat in this thing, and it's wonderful. And it cleans up beautifully. It costs, but then again, it will last the rest of your life. Really, every cook needs one of these - just get it."
3,Chopn's Greatest Hits,Not a good version of Les Sylphides (#17); which is only a 5 minute excerpt. Any other Les Sylphides pieces are sprinkled throughout the CD as piano.
5,Fantastic!!,Frederic Chopin is a very talented artist and composer. A must have of any Chopin collector.
2,Misleading (It's only Vol3 - Romans to 2 Corinthians),"Although the title is Gnomon of the New Testament, it is only Volume III of the work - Romans through to 2 Corinthians. It is a public domain photocopy of the original and many pages are so light that they are difficult to read."
5,Best Christmas disc ever.,Written and performed by Toby Keith this has become a perienal favorite for my whole family. He is a great song writer and musical performer. Talented is an understatement. This really has the spirit of Christmas shining through.
3,"Toby Keith ""Christmas to Christmas""","I rarely like all the songs on a CD and this one is no different. But the price was right, I like Toby, and I'm glad I got it."
5,Marvelous Contemporary Christmas Album,"From 1995, this is Toby fourth album and first Christmas album. It's his only contemporary album of Christmas songs along with two other albums of classic Christmas songs. This album is a marvelous collection of songs of both heart warming and touching ballads and driving, rocking beats. All songs tell a story whether it be heart touching or humorous. If you want a new kind of Christmas album, this is surely the one to get! I bought one, and now I have boughen another as a gift for the upcoming Christmas for a Toby fan."
1,TUBY THE REDNECK RAINDEER.,"If you are not a fan of TUBY then you'll totally not enjoy this poorly conceived product.TUB does not master the vocal range, quality or style to pull off a successful country flavored holiday CD package as did MARTINA, KENNY, GARTH, REBA, ANNE MURRAY or VINCE GILL. This is unfortunately a total waste of your money."
5,"Full-Bodied, Rich, and Mellow","Newly re-mastered, this 2008 Keepnews Collection CD comes up sounding fuller and more life-like than the original ""first generation"" OJC disc. Often described as a comeback album for Coleman Hawkins, it features the leader's fine hand-picked lineup in a truly one-of-a kind (1957) recording.The arrangements in all 6 tracks provide pleasing sonorities among the 3 horns, and there are many tasteful solos. I find J.J Johnson's trombone work especially enjoyable. Hank Jones on piano, Oscar Pettiford on bass, Jo Jones, on drums-are you kidding me? This is easily one of the best Coleman Hawkins CDs available. No alternate takes or bonus tracks, just the original album in great sound. Like a fine wine, THE HAWK FLIES HIGH gets better with age--and repeat listens."
3,Awesome but not the best price out there,"This was a great purchase for me when I found it. However, if I had continued to look online, I would have found another store with a wider selection of the sugar plum accessories at a better price."
4,Ian Myles Slater on A Twice-Told Tale,"I have given this splendid fantasy / alternate universes novel four stars instead of five only because it also exists in an expanded (and otherwise revised) form, under the title ""Shaman"" (Baen Books). Both versions are worth reading, but ""Shaman,"" which unfortunately is also out of print, is probably the more satisfactory, if available.Some of those who have read the book in either form may not have recognized that the ""classic text"" read by the protagonist, Mircea Eliade's ""Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy,"" is a real book. It is worth reading in its own right (and at places amounts to a technical commentary on the novel, like Hal Clement's essays on the factual content of his science fiction novels), but it is not nearly as a much fun."
1,malo malo,no sirve para nada es pura apariencia el mismo dia que lo estaba montando se cayeron los adornos azules y rojos ya que vienen pegados con tape.y la manguera no es de las mejores
5,A Story of Unmeasureable Faith,"You Can Be Somebody 2 is not only good reading but an example of how unmoveable Faith in God can lead to nothing but success in all endeavors. Ted Mead is an inspirational and encouraging character. He is also intriguing, because not only is there no limit to his faith, but there is no limits in his achievements through his trust in God. Mrs. Mayfield did an excellent job in presenting how perserverence and faith in God can only lead to success in all things endeavored. Hats off to the author!"
2,Not what I thought,"This reader was not what I thought. Not all the reader is written with characters. The sentences and reader combines romanization and characters as well. I would prefer that the new vocubulary, that it is supossed that you do not know, would be first presented in both, romanization and character, and use only the character in the reader.Another thing that I do not like is the Yale romanization used in the book. I think pinyin romanization would be much better."
1,TERRIBLE CD,"The sound is TERRIBLE, the manufacturer did not do his job to really master this music into digital, and it sound TERRIBLE, i AM VERY DISATISFIED WITH THIS AUDIO CD."
1,If you like brown water order these...,"I own the Melitta One:One machine and made this on the small 5oz. cup and it had NO taste. It really was brown water. Did not enjoy it at all! Do not buy, try something else."
5,Another awsome Gundam entry.,"Gundam is always a great series, this saga is no exception with it's unique take on ""war"". The characters, Gundams, and plot overall fit really well together here, would definitely recommend this for any gundam fan."
3,Oh has Bandai fallen from Grace.,"Gundam 00 is decent. Does not hold up to the classics like 0083 Stardust Memory or the MS 08th team. This series has a little bit of everything for everyone. The video quality is terrible compared to older releases. Bandai North America is falling from Grace. I'm glad to see them leaving the industry, as there current products are extremely sub standard compared to what they put out a few years ago. It really is sad to see considering that they have the licenses for some of the greatest recent anime shows. Hopefully someone can put out a Gurren lagann and a code geass Blu ray set when Bandai completely steps out of the American Anime industry.Reccomend the product only for the story, and nothing else. If your looking for anything fancy it's not here. The packaging is plain and bland, and there are hardly any extras."
2,dont bother,"Some nice writing and photos in some ways these books are not dated, but I would look for a newer book if I was serious about climbing there"
4,I'm white and I learned a lot.,"I saw this book in the public library and had to check it out. As a white woman who is concerned about civil rights issues, I felt I had to read it. Well, it was certainly eye-opening and uncomfortable in some places.These African-American authors and cartoonists, featured in these essays, excerpts, and visual art representations, did not pull back from their feelings and observations. They said what they meant, and meant what they said! Their viewpoints were vastly different from mine, and I had to stop and really THINK about it, sometimes in mid-paragraph. That they were telling the truth, from their perspective, cannot be denied."
4,Excellent Overall,"For an older book, I have found this book to be quite eyeopening indeed. I have had an interest in the Third Reich since at least 1955 but have never really ""gotten into"" the Kriegsmarine.The information, though somewhat dated, is well written and all in all, a very interesting treatise on the WWII German Navy.I recommend it as a good read!"
2,Big Letdown,"Until I purchased this CD, I always said that I'd buy any Tears for Fears recording on faith. Since this may be the final one to come out, it's just as well. There are a few interesting cuts, but most of the CD is a combination of ""B"" cuts and cuts that understandably never made it to the final pressing. This one's worth passing on."
2,Disappointment,"As a general rule, when I purchase a CD of outtakes and rare cuts that didn't make it to any official releases, I don't expect much in quality. In this case, I stand by my general rule. Don't believe the many biased TFF who give this CD 5 stars just because they are devoted to the group. This collection is interesting but not a must have for ALL TFF fans. But I am keeping mine :-)"
1,Great Disappointment,"I used to say that I'd buy anything by TFF, without a listen. Sorry to say, I should have listened to this one, first. It's a collection of cuts that never made it to a recording until TFF disbanded, and there's a reason these never made it to a recording: they're largely unlistenable. Save your money."
4,Not necessarily strictly for only fans,"Usually a b-sides album is considered a must have for true fans of an artist or band. This time, it is not necessarily so. Sure there are quirky instrumental tunes that only devout TFF fans will enjoy but there are so many hidden treasures on this album. First, the amazing cover of David Bowie's ""Ashes To Ashes"" is fanatastic. Roland sings the first couple of lines so close to Bowie that it is hard, at first, to distinguish the original from the cover. Second, ""Lord of Karma"" was originally the b-side to ""Laid So Low"". At the time of its original release, I would constantly play this song on my college radio station. It should have been a single, rather than a b-side. Third, ""The Way You Are"" was never available in the US (it was a single in the UK)until now. It is repetitive but catchy as hell. This b-sides album is definitely a cut above the rest."
5,"outstanding ""odds & ends"" collection","If you are looking for the ""big hits"" from Tears for Fears you won't find them on this CD, but for me this an even more interesting collection than one of their ""Greatest Hits"" collections, offering up a wide variety of ""odds and ends"" in the way of B-sides, instrumentals, and other non-album rarities. If you have more than a passing interest in Tears for Fears, who I think were one of the more underrated bands of the 1980s and 90s, then you should get this CD collection without further delay. Overall this is a very satisfying collection of music, one that shows the depth and diversity of a very fine band."
5,TFF fans,"Enjoy this cd alot. Purchased this for Schrodingers Cat but found other songs on cd that I like even better. My Life in the Suicide Ranks- very underproduced, just jamming here and Roland is a genius here. When In Love With A Blind Man is another very good track, with alot of Curt Smith. Lord Of Karma is very Hendrix-like, highly recommended for the Roland fan. Has a breathy thing going on that is VERY interesting. Bloodletting Go- probably one of my favorite TFF songs of all time, if not my very favorite.(It sounds as if Roland really has his heart in it here.) Pharoahs- haunting, beautiful song. Can listen to this one over and over and just drift away. I recommend this cd to the hard-core Roland Orzabal fan. It is just a little different and the Roland fan would appreciate it most. BUT, Pharoahs and Bloodletting Go are for anyone who loves good, good music."
2,Not that great.,"I bought their Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits) and Elemental CDs, and I love both of these albums. I saw this one for a good price and bought it, and I am now planning on selling it. It makes me think of scraps on the cutting room floor. Unless you are a VERY big fan of TFF, I recommend staying away from this one."
4,very pretty,"This ia a practical dish for risotto, roast pork, sliced meat.not very big for large scale entertaining though."
5,DO NOT READ THIS BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!,This game is so good stop reading now and order.It is like no other game i have played before.In the game you BUILD YOUR OUN CASTLE and use tactics to defend and attack all the while maniging your city.it is hard to start not knowing what to do but after that its all fun. If you wanna try the demo for free go to gamespyarcade.com and get a free acount and download it free.But thats a wast of time because its not good its very good.
2,bulky purse calendar,"This calendar is twice as thick as most pocket calendars, so don't go for this if you're looking for something small. The cheap cardboard piece on the cover designed to hold a small picture is looking shabby already at the end of January. I will probably have to replace this before the year is over with something more elegant and sturdy. The space in the back for notes has been handy."
4,a hermeneutical view on Paul VI liturgical reform,"""Like it"" is certainly not the appropriate term for describing my appreciation of Father Bouyer's work. I had my attention drawn on his work by Father Cekada's study on Paul VI liturgical reform. Although I deeply disapprove Paul VI manipulation of liturgy this work helps you to understand the aims which led to such a change of patterns."
2,Bad Saw Design,"The saw runs fine, but I regret not returning the saw immediately after buying it. The unique design of the handle prevents you fron seeing the blade as you try to follow a line. You have to depend on the flimsey plastic quide to follow a line. I have not broken the plastic guide yet because I have been very careful to protect it, but it could break very easily. Changing the blade is a real chore. The clearances between the guard and sole plate make it extremely difficult to install a 7 1/4"" blade. I actually have to warp the blade to get it inserted. Skil also did not include a rip fence with the saw. I had to purchase that separately. I thought that was rather chintzy since it is a necessry accessory and so inexpensive to provide."
5,All time classic Francoise Hardy album,"I first received this album in December 1981 and it has been a firm favourite ever since. One that takes a few plays to appreciate then stays with you forever. Great variety of song styles from the fast Jazzy Retro Satanas to quiet thoughtful ballads such as Seule Comme une Pomme, and the smoky bar late night Gin Tonic. I can't praise it enough. Love it!"
1,Dry and hard to read,"I had to read this for my course. The author assumes you know pretty much everything about the Reformation and all its players. Full of lofty vernacular, I had to read the book with Google open so that I could look up what he was writing about... and I have some background knowledge of the Reformation. In addition to anything else, the print is woeful and detracts from any enjoyment to be derived from this turgid slog."
3,Great if it actually worked... all the time,"When it adheres to a surface, it is great. Doesn't appear to like all bathroom fiberglass, even after scuffing the surface with 500 grit sand paper. Will probably opt for the good old-fashioned slow dry calk in the future."
3,Did what its suppose to...,i gave it 3 stars because it did what it suppose to do however it was not what i purchased. i purchase this product because of the cap design it advertised but the product i receive was not what i ordered. it came with the standard cap you would get with most caulk products.
5,psych theories of personality,The item is as described. It is in good condition. the product is a good deal. not expensive at all!
1,Don't plan on learning anything......,"This author writes herself in circles, jumps around, interjects silly metaphors throughout, and ultimately vomits too much information at the reader that is not properly disseminated (too much information on the irrelevant, not enough on what she is attempting to describe). It takes 110% of your attention just to make down a page to try and follow the train-of thought. You will find yourself day-dreaming......even in the middle of the night!"
2,Not the worst ever,"As a correspondent with one of the authors of this title, in his defense, he wrote it long ago when evangleicalism was producing ""responses"" to everything under the sun.It has obvious flaws, like accepting some of the less founded criticisms of D&D;'s effects as factual, and in using quotes out of context to trash the D&D; books.But along with this ""bathwater"" is a ""baby"" of a call to discernment and moderation, which is too often ignored.I also find it interesting that while D&D; has often denied accuers who link it to the occult, it seems that as the occult has become more mainstream, D&D; has adapted to the mainstreaming of the occult. A few of the publishers higher-up employees ARE admitted occultists (they admit it).But D&D; really doesn't contain occult info or encourage the dabbling in any real occult practices.I certainly don't think the reviewer who said this was just a moneymaking scheme on the part ofthe author was warranted."
1,"Yeah, and this guy ever read a book other than the Bible","It's not that Christians in general misunderstand the game. Au contraire, I know a Christian family with more RPG in their blood than half the guys who write th D&D books. It's that they'd rather be hypocrites than formulate an unbiased opinion. And hey, there's nothing wrong with being a hypocrite. Jesus probably LOVES D&D."
1,Christians completely misunderstand D&D,"Of all the christian propaganda I have heard, this is just a lame excuse made by them. I cannot see in just what this book says, but everything else, how D&D is associated with satan and hitler. This book to me just seems like another excuse for something christians cannot explain. For how long I have been playing D&D, it has not affected my reality at all."
3,...,"This is a good album. But just a quick note, the last song Mother, Mother was originally done by Tracy Bonham in 1994. In my opinion, the original version is far more superior. You should check it out."
3,Alright 4 duo,The songs on this cd are alright. the songs that have been released are nothing like the rest of the songs on the cd. So if you liked the songs that have been released you're better off buying the singles.
5,POP/ROCK at its best,"This is simply a gender on its own. The song that will get you hooked on them is 4ever. Its one of those guilty pleasures that you just have to hear over and over. It starts of slow and then in the solo they just give it all the distortion and drum beats they got, and then they show off their amazing voices. You'll end up wanting more and more. "" just one taste and you'll want moreeeeeeeeee"""
5,The Secret Life of the Veronicas - Great Debut Album!,"You probably have heard the song ""Untouched"" which is in the album ""Hook Me Up"". Well, let me tell you something. This album is almost as good as ""Hook Me Up"". This album rocks! You could say that the music is near Avril Lavigne or Miley Cyrus. Still, I think that this is even better than their debut albums. These two girls know how to rock! ""4ever"" starts the rockin' way. Most of the album songs are upbeat tracks, only ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Speechless"", and ""Nobody Wins"" are little bit peaceful. These girls have an excellent voices. The final track ""Mother Mother"" is maybe the most powerful track in this album - I mean the roughest.Stars: 4ever, Secret, When It All Falls Apart"
3,3.5 stars actually...very good debut!!!!!!!,"OKAY OKAY...I DO LOVE THIS ALBUM...IT REMINDS ME OF THOSE TWO GIRLS THAT FORMED T.A.T.U. IF U REMEMBER THEM...THERE ARE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN SONGS ON THE ALBUM I LIKE..IT STARTS OUT WITH THEIR HIT SONG ""4EVER"" WHICH IS JUST WONDERFUL..THEN A POSSIBLE SECOND SINGLE ""EVERYTHING IM NOT"" WHICH IS ALSO ONE OF MY FAVS...AND I ALSO LIKE ""MOUTH SHUT"" ""MOTHER MOTHER"" AND OTHERS...BUT LETS TALK ABOUT THE LYRICS NOW..I SAW WHERE SOME SAID THEY WERE GREAT LYRICS..NO NO NO..NOT ON ALL OF THE SONGS..ON THE SONG ""SECRET"" HERE R SOME OF THE LYRICS....""i never looked at u that way...cuz i always thought u were gay...""THAT IS RETARDED AND RIDICULOUS...I DONT LIKE THAT SONG JUST BECAUSE OF THAT...LOL...ITS JUST BAD LYRICS...BUT ANYWAYS GOOD ALBUM...BUY IT..ITS WORTH TEN BUCKS AT WAL MART..."
2,Should Have Stayed A Secret....,"I love Pop/Rock so I wanted this CD after hearing the first single ""4EVER"". Too bad nothing else on this CD is worth listening too. The vocals are annoying and the lyrics are even more annoying. I would not wish this much pain on anyone. Nothing is very catchy. I found myself getting irritated because of the whiny voices. Stay away from this debut with no kick."
5,vic's picks,"If you want a good looking car or truck ,this is the product for you . Make your car or truck look show room vehicle.I gave this product 45 stars."
5,Great product!,This works great to remove fine scratches. It leaves a nice shine. The best of this kind on the market.
5,Provides guidance in the practice and art of journaling.,"This book is an excellent guide to journaling for beginners or people who have experience in journaling. The author provides suggestions for setting up a journal and establishing an atmosphere conducive to writing. She introduces ""moves""(steps) and many techniques to help the flow of writing begin and be sustained. Her keywording, indexing and clustering techniques allow identification of areas to be further explored and is a useful way of referencing past writings. Readers will find gentle, adaptable and helpful direction in this book in their pursuit of journaling whether their beliefs are religious, spiritual, both or neither in nature."
4,Review of Old Friends,"Item arrived earlier than expected. Perfect condition. However, bad packing. The box arrived almost opened. One could have easily taken the CD out of the box."
5,Clean Your Chimney Anytime For A Lot Less Money,Pays for itself three times over the first time you use this chimney brush. Be sure to totally mask off your fireplace door before brushing. Also purchase the six section pole kit to get eighteen feet of rod extension. You can always use less if your chimney is lower. Sweeps are now charging at least $120.00 to clean your chimney. This system pays for itself over & over again!
2,Know what you are buying,"This plane is hard to fly. I had one good flight of about 20 seconds, the others were a rather quick crash. I could not get it to take off on pavement. It is best to fly over a field with tall grass to cusion your landing/crash. The plane is very light so the slightest breeze will cause problems."
4,The Classic Revenge Tragedy,"There have been great controversies over whether The Spanish Tragedy is the greatest English play to have ever been composed, or rather a fantastic counterfeit of past playwrights. Either way, this revenge tragedy delves into the realm of human suffering and selfishness while searching for answers in the heavens or in the wicked wheel of Fortune. While some characters are a bit melodramatic, one must be aware that melodrama was one of the few ways to properly express emotion on the Elizabethan stage. It's a quick read, but not for the light of heart or mind when dealing with the fanciful language and tranfers between long and even-redundant soliloquies and sporadic stichomythia. Don't expect this to be any sort of heart-warming play; there's a reason it's called a tragedy."
2,It is a Deck of Cards.,"This is not a book. It is a deck of 52 playing cards. I'm incredibly organized, so I don't have a problem keeping them together but...how are you going to find this tiny box when you need it? And how much information can you fit on a card? Not much.The ideas are ...so-so. Not very interesting. This is supposed to be for ADULTS, yet they give ideas for things like fingerpainting, playing with play doh, Pin the Tail on the Donkey and other kids games...I'm with my kids all day doing that stuff! When I'm with my friends, no thanks.Because its a standard size deck of cards, there is very little room to write. So, they give you an idea but there are no instructions. If you aren't good at improvising and don't want to put a lot of thought into implementing the ideas here that you happen to like, don't bother because there is no help in this box for you! I have all the Amazon game books. This one I just don't care for."
4,Great ideas for over 6 years old,"Bought these cards for ideas for pre-school age children when flying, but found the ideas to be better suited to older kids. My mistake - and as I'm not one to give up easily, I just use the ideas and change them to suit my younger children...who are getting older all the time anyway! Great product when I'm tired and need inspiration on long haul flight."
3,"Nice format, nothing really unusual","This set of things to do is in the format of a deck of mini cards, each of which contains a different Chicago experience. While there is certainly plenty of choice in this product, the content is very ordinary except for the traveler who has never been to Chicago before."
1,A *COMPLETE* waste of money ... What a ripoff!,"This was the worst waste of money I ever spent. All of the short, simple ""tips"" are self-explanatory; I can't even imagine anyone over the age of 9 not already knowing them. Unless you spend most of your spare time mugging people, I can't imagine that it would add anything to your life. I would very strongly suggest that you save your money and skip this one. YUCK!"
4,It's pretty good!,I think it good for kid because it keeps them bess.I get very bored on a plane when it is a long trip. I got this book thinking it would be good and it was.I think if you are bored on trips on a plane it is a good choose.
4,Great movie suggestions for the romantic!,"These cards are great romantic movie suggestions, perfect for a date with your sweetheart. I was expecting to see mainly classic old films and was pleasantly surprised by the wide array and selection. There's something for everyone here!"
2,This is OK,I would like to read about more complex spells than the ones in here. This should be for beginners learning magic.
3,Somewhat disappointing.,"I bought this for the full-length rendition of Rhapsody in Blue. I found the brass too tinny sounding, and the rhythm off in a few places. I like the snippet of this song on the ""Best of the Milleneum"" CD much better."
1,ZERO stars!,This item has no power and is useless. I paid $10 for a similar item that works better. NO way is this thing worth $30 and it is going back as soon as possible!
3,Poor product description,"I have used drawer lock router bits before, and ordered this because my old one was dull. It's a fine bit, but the product description does not suggest that the stock for the drawer front or back must be more than 1/2"". Most of these types of bits can be used with 1/2"" stock. Wasted my money on this one."
3,A light comedy with a serious message,"My first reaction was-this is for teens or twenty-year olds but I stayed with it and found some thing worthwhile. The female character taught a valuable lesson to two horny boys.: that women are to be respected for what they are- and are not objects for what men fantasize about them. Played by the beautiful Claudia Christian, the female lead is a lesbian, a woman with the aspirations of allwomen;viz, a good job, a loving relationship, compassion, fun. This film is a credit to the director who took a locale and filled it with comedy, danger, and pathos so that one'sinterest held. That was a trick. All actors were well cast. I did like the film."
4,Good sturdy chair with plenty of room,I'm a big guy and this chair has the room to make me comfortable. Seems very sturdy too.
2,Think twice,"This book was purchased to have a second copy of the book so my mother would feel better about lending it to her friends. The printer photcopied the pages from a previous printing & reduced the print size. Some of the pages are hard to read.There is no problem with what the book is about because I have read an earlier printing. Think about checking it out of a library before you buy this ""photocopy""."
3,Platypus,"It says all the stuff you would expect. It speaks of how the platypus is a mammal, but has so many birdlike traits. You see how they lack nipples, but feed milk through their bodies like perspiration. Of course, they show the echidnea, as it is the only animal with things in common with the platypus. They speak of the venom that males have. However, I would really like to know why only males have it. Is this a tool that they only use to fight each other? I think it is stated that it wouldn't make humans feel good, but it would not kill them, unlike many poisonous snakes and frogs. This would be a great video to show an elementary school science class."
4,Good but not great,"Do not get me wrong, this is an excellent cookbook. There are several southern classics, in this book. But, the follow-up, Big Mama's Back In The Kitchen, is hands-down the BEST and GREATEST cookbook from Charlene Johnson. I have both books, and Big Mama's Back In The KItchen is the one that is beat up and food stained from so many uses. ""Old Black Pot"" would have 5 stars if I did not have to compare it to ""Back In The Kitchen""."
2,"Run, Don't Walk - Away!","I read the other reviews before I wrote this, and I couldn't help but notice that NOT ONE of the ""reviewers"" said anything about the recipes. Why? Because they are terrible! Let me explain: I am a cookbook reader, collector, cook and baker. I read/review and try cookbooks ALL THE TIME. This cookbook is terrible! The recipes just do not work - and I've tried a lot of them.As far as ideas go, if you want to get really chummy with your neighbors, then buy this book - that's where it gets 2 stars from me."
1,Great plan -into- action book,"Every section of this book gives great plans for having fun in your neighborhood. I live in an area that already has scheduled events, but this gives many more ideas for other opportunities to involve those not already involved.I also like the sections on what to do when someone moves into your neighborhood, has a prolonged illness, or if someone dies... it give many good ideas on meals or practical things to do."
4,"A good complement to ""Cadillac Desert,"" but a notch below","However, while I appreciate other reviewers' passion, Marc Reisner has a broader scope in that book, covering the aquifer-driven irrigation of the High Plains as well as the river-fed irrigation of the Southwest.Plus, his book has a 1993 revised edition, making it newer and more informative.Above all, though, as a journalist, rather than an academic. Reisner is simply the better writer. His book is more of a story than ""Rivers of Empire,"" and reads that way, as well as having the broader and more updated coverage.Indeed, with an older-style typeface (at least in hardcover), Worster's book looks much more dated.For somebody new to this subject, this is still a very solid four-star book. But, having read and re-read ""Cadillac Desert,"" in that context, I rate ""Rivers of Empire"" at 3.5 stars."
3,Unpredictable set of toasti-toes,"I've been ordering Toasti-toes from Amazon for a couple of years now. I have had more than a few batches, and each box has been wonderful. However, with this last order, they arrived in a large manila envelope rather than the brand box...and several of the packs have not worked adequately. Either they barely warm up at all, or their heat only lasts a couple of hours instead of the typical 6-8. Again, this is the first time I've had a problem, but it was disappointing."
1,Bait and Switch,"I received a ""used"" lock that was not even an ilco. I worte the company and quickly got no where. Such a shame."
1,pure crap,"i'd give this movie -10 stars if i could. it's crap. bad acting, bad effects. Nothing in this movie makes up for anything! this is nothing more than a low budget porno flick."
2,i want my 90 min. back,THIS MOVIE WASNT WORTH THE FOUR DOLLARS I SPENT ON IT. THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE WORSE. ITS NOT EVEN WORTH THE TIME ITS TAKING ME TO TYPE THIS REVIEW.. THE MOVIE PLAIN STINKS!
1,thehighestbeing,"Do not get this sad excuse for a horror movie unless you like fake $1.00 spiderwebs, exxxxxxxtremely bad: acting, special effects (laughable,looks Like they just used powerpoint), script, lines, sex scenes(two pg-rated bad ones), repeated scenes of ghouls eating the same persons' guts (looks like jelly), fighting scenes (touch gouls face it falls off). The only horror in this movie is the horror of knowing it's more than 2 minutes long after you've starting watching it. I rolled my eyes several times at how bad everything was, everything I listed above and whatever else you can think of that I messed. Frankly, I don't want to spend another minute thinking about it. I bought the dvd, I watched the dvd in agony, I gave the dvd away, the end."
1,Near Death,"One of the Worst movies out there on the market! Save your money, not even worth a rental! Bad movie, bad acting, all in all BAD!"
1,SO SO BAD!,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. This film is so so low budget. Why was this even put on blu-ray. For what reason? It still looks like crap. The picture looks terrible. The special effects are the worst I ever seen, if you want to call them special effects. Everything looks so fake. There isn't any reason to buy this movie. Save your money and your time. I got this for $4.99 at F.Y.E. on sale, and now I can see why. After I watched it, I immediately gave the movie to a friend who just got a blu-ray player, and is trying to start up his collection. He thanked me for the movie, but that was before he viewed it. No matter how cheap you see this movie for, don't buy it. It definitely wasn't worth the $4.99 I paid for it. The most this movie is worth is maybe $1.00, and that is only if you need a replacement blu-ray case, if you have one cracked. If you do, use the case, and toss the disc and artwork away. There is nothing you need to see on this disc."
5,AWESOME!,I don't know how this item doesn't have any reviews yet but I guess I'll be the first lol this Pro Wrap Pad is GREAT!! I've recently become a huge fan of squatting and right now I'm at 4 45 lb. plates on each side and that's without using this pad...I CANT WAIT to see how much I improve due to me using this neck pad! Iv'e already used it twice and WOW it's super comfortable and it hardly puts any pressure on my back or neck so it feels like I'm hardly lifting anything so it helps A LOT!! I highly recommend buying this Pro Wrap Pad if your serious on squatting and want to avoid any back or neck injuries!
3,words of wisdom and not so wise thoughts,"Old men usually have a lot of important things to say; the problem is that either many of them do not know how to say it in an interesting and engaging manner, or do not care to share their wise thoughts as they've learned that silence is golden. Not so with Andy Rooney; this crankiest of old men has a lot of things to say, loves to say them, and is pretty good at making it interesting. An example is this book, one of multiple by the 60 minutes personae. Written as a compilation of items he has discussed on air at various times, each short section examines a certain issue from multiple points of view. Some topics are heavy; like the Cold War or women's rights. Other topics are more lighthearted; like food, sports, and annoying habits that we put up with in our close relations. This is an interesting book and worth the time to read it. The book appeals to more than just old people, and anyone with any sort of humor can appreciate it. I recommend it."
3,Humorous but not on a par with his other works,"This book is good for a few laughs but lacks the humour that most of his other books have. More importantly, it seems to lack the wit and insight of his other books."
1,Way overpriced,"This is a 40 page book. Why does it cost $25? While it does have good info in it, dont' buy it. I have never seen a book that cost 50 cents per page. A big ripoff!"
5,This book is incredibly funny!,This book was not only about Freddy but about all the other animals. I liked the way the author made every character have as big a part as the main characters. I highly recommend this book for children who like animals with human characteristics.
1,1 Month and waiting!!!! Don't order from CYMAX,"It's been one month now (4 Mar 2011 - 4 Apr 2011) and I still don't have my bed. I was sent the wrong bed and am now stuck in customer service purgatory where everything is 1-3 days from happening. I really, really wanted to write a review where Cymax was prompt and got back to me in a timely manner and I could praise them up and down. But sadly this is not so. And now I have had to call every 1-6 days for a status update. Their customer service line is so backed up all the time that I have to ""press 1 to place an order"" just to get someone to pick up the phone.I hope to update this review with glad tidings. Stay tuned."
1,Unhappy,"I'm a first time buyer from amazon and the last time as well. This bed seem like a good buy when anyone first set eyes on it. king size bed, nice hard wood and 6 pull out draws, it seems pretty cool. Other buyers even let you know the bed takes time for u to reconstruct it 7hrs that is. I can deal with that but really (this is where the problems start) no one tells you the bed comes in 3 cartons not 1 but 3 of them that gets shipped on the same day and arrives on different days. People have lives in cant wait for these delivers. The bed is not even made yet and I want it gone. If i was you ill go down to the local sleepy or what ever and get it the. At least you know that your bed is coming in full plus you have a places to sleep on."
3,Check the Shipping!,"the bed - Very sturdy and easy to assemble for a mail order bed. (Although it is a little tedious, there is a lot of parts due to the shelving.) I love the platform bed, but see my caveat for the headboard.HOWEVER - Do not choose the lowest list price. I ended up paying double for shipping than I did for my gun safe which weighed about 3 times more. Before you choose which Amazon company to use, put it in cart and see what the total price is... then repeat until you find the TRUE best price.1-5-09 update - Now that I have had it for a few weeks. The drawers are pretty useless. 2-3 are already not tracking well, as if the tracks are worn or warped. I am simply not going through the effort to disassemble to get the necessary access to fix. I am trying to find out how to drop my rating a star or two."
2,Better on paper than in practice...,"On paper, this is a great idea and product. It was a nightmare to get together and the quality of the drawers and their functionality are disappointing. Would be a great college bed, first apartment bed..."
4,"Very handy storage, and looks nice!","The bed came in exactly as advertised, and wasn't too difficult to put together. The quality of the product pieces met my expectations, and the looks very high end for something with drawers on the bottom. I've been sleeping on it for a few months now and I have no complaints!"
2,"Affordable, easy to assemble, but not too sturdy","We bought this bed because it looked simple, and it is. It felt fairly sturdy as we built it, which took about two hours. One of the drawers doesn't close properly -- it pokes out a little so the front is not flush with the rest of the frame -- but for the price we are willing to accept that. The other day we tried to shift it a little bit to adjust the rug underneath it, but we lifted from the wrong place and two screws tore through the particle board in which they were anchored. I don't think it will affect the stability of the bed, but it definitely made us sad. This bed will probably have to stay where it is; moving it is not really an option."
1,This bed is crap,"The bed arrived quickly, but the parts were horrific and did not fit together. My husband took 4 hours and lots of cussing to put it together. The screws do not align with the alan wrench bolts, so they would strip the wood. The bed came chipped already. Particle boards broke very easily. Drawers are very small. Slats move too much and are too short. We could feel the slats even through a very nice 10 inch memory foam mattress. We are taking the darn thing apart and returning it. Read all the reviews, you will see they are similar to this one."
3,good,"Once asambeled this item is good. The asambling part was the problem, it was very hard. Some of the screws didn't fit, a little drawer part was missing, some hardware was bended. We have to return the first time we ordered it since 4 big pieces arrived with cracks."
4,Great Bed for a budget,"I purchased this bed frame almost 2 years ago. The assembly took a long time. Much similar to the frustration of putting together Ikea furniture. Obvisiously the make up of this frame is composite, so its not the best quality. However, 2 years later it still looks great, drawers still function properly, and the frame itself has held up well with my memory foam mattress. For the money, I think its worth it."
3,Missing pieces,"It was easy to put together. The directions were simple. The delivery guys brought all the boxes up to my 3rd floor. Bed looks great, however it was missing 2 brackets for the drawers. I called the missing pieces # in the packet, however they never showed up & I don't have the paper with the # anymore. Sucks to be me"
3,King storage platform bed,We spent today putting this item together. It wasn't really easy. But we finished. One problem is that four of the six drawers do not close flush. Does this mean the platform is not square? Anybody have any suggestions about what do do?I don't thing I will purchase another storage bed if the drawers do t close.
1,do not buy...CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS BED IS ACTUALLY COMING APART. ITS NEVER BEEN MOVED AND THER IS NO REASON FOR THE DRAWERS ALL TO BE BREAKING AND ITS LITERALLY COMING APART.............
2,Buyer Beware; You Get What You Pay For,"I just finished assembling this product that I bought a few months ago (was thinking about moving so kept it boxed/disassembled). It is SUCH a poor quality and unsafe product I'm astonished it is available to purchase thru Amazon. I expected it to take some time to assemble (large pre-assembled furniture often does not fit into my narrow apt bldg hallway & door). IT TOOK 5 HOURS (and I'm a pretty good DIY'er). The finished product is so flimsy, creeky, poor-quality that I will never be able to disassemble it to move it. The edges of the head and floor boards are SO sharp I've scraped myself several times. The laminate is so poor you cannot even get it assembled without scratches. The drawers don't align properly and when you fill them they weaken and break. THE 24 T-SPACER CONNECTORS ARE PLASTIC AND SPLIT WHEN YOU TIGHTEN (NOT OVER TIGHTEN) THE DRAWER SLIDE SCREWS!!!I would not recommend this product to anyone. BUYER BEWARE."
1,Expresso Headboard,"The product had multiple scratches,scrapes and huge gashes when it was delivered. It was fairly simple to put together after the instructions were e-mailed to me. (They forgot to send them but are very quick to get them to you if you call the number on the website) Aside, from all of the gashes (We have them hidden by pillows,blankets, etc) in the furniture, it's nice."
4,Good bed.,"Bed is sturdy and pretty easy to put together. Looks beautiful! Only complaint is that the first time it came, one of the packages (it comes in 3 separate huge boxes) was either accidentally opened, or dropped, or something... and it was all scratched up and broken. However, upon calling customer service - they easily issued me a return and exchange. Second set of boxes came in perfect condition!"
4,GREAT FOR THE MONEY..,"THE BED WAS DELIVERED IN A WEEK, AND ALL OF THE ITEAMS WERE THERE. THE BED QUALITY IS VERY GOOD FOR THE PRICE THAT YOU ARE PAYING. IT IS VERY HEAVY AND STABLE. I BUILT THE WHOLE BED BY MYSELF IN 5 1/2 HOURS, I DO RECOMMEND 2 PEOPLE SO THAT IT WILL GO BY FASTER. THE BED HAS PRE DRILLED HOLES THAT ARE ALL EVEN WHICH HELPED MADE THE MAKING OF THE BED EASIER. I DID USE A POWER SCREW DRIVER THAT ALSO HELPED THE PROCESS GO MUCH QUICKER. AT THE END, THE BED LOOKED A LOT NICER THEN THE PICTURES ON AMAZONS WEBSITE.WORD TO THE WISE: DO NOT LOSE ANY OF YOUR SCREWS, THEY DO NOT GIVE EXTRA."
2,If you can't make it good don't make it.,It's beautiful enough for the cost but first time I tried to move it it began to disintegrate. Blech. So we are stuck with it where it is... No idea what it's fate will be when we move.
3,Well,"The bed and head boad I bought together don't fit together, they also have a small flaw in the holes in the middle being too close to the top, and broke away, and one of the draws bottums wasn't put together right. It has a hole in it where it looks like they didn't put enough wood when they made the pressed wood....lol Other than that the bed is great, it looks beautiful. And some wood glue and hard work, makes the bed look great...lol"
4,Sonoma Black full bed,"I purchased this bed for my 14 year old, who is in high school. He love s the bed and says that he appreciate the drawers. When I seen this I thought it would be great to purchase this to work with the space we have in our apartment."
3,It is what it is,"First off you have to understand this is boxed furniture like Ikea or Walmart. It takes some time to put together and you have tO be careful cause it will break. It is all plywood type material. My mom bought it then decided it was too big for her room so I got it at a discount :). But I didn't fully disassemble it and loaded it on a truck to get it home. It was hard to get the drawers to line back up, but it did eventually after some tweaking. If u plan to stay in one place for awhile it's a pretty good, but if you move alot I wouldn't recommend it. It won't disassemble and reassemble easily. It will probably break if you do. It hold the bed great though. The grit braces of the headboard (sold seperatly) didn't gO all the way to the floor so it will only fit snug against the wall with the bed against it. I would suggest looking for a rooms to go outlet. They had all kinds of beds, with dressers for under $600. And that stuff will last. All in all it's just ok."
4,I felt that i should write something...,"I bought this bed almost a year ago. It arrived quickly and was in good condition. One corner was damaged during shipping. It wasn't worth sending it back. I dab of super glue and it was as good as new. I bought the same bed for my niece. There were a ton of negative reviews. I was amazed. I'm a big guy. 6'8"" 275 I've broken every bed I've owned since I was 12. I've tried to break this bed. Lol No such luck. It doesn't shimmy or wobble. It doesn't make a sound. It's amazing. I've paid twice as much for a bed frame and it lasted half as long. Yes, it is pressed wood. The drawers are at best flimsy. They're great for socks, underwear, or pillows. Not much more. Overall, I would and have bought this bed again."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is a cheap piece of crap! Immediately after unpacking the veneer started scraping off. The drawers don't fit in properly (three out of six don't close flush to the bed- not because it's assembled improperly simply because it is CRAP!) Several slats too short (don't reach from foot to head). Definitely NOT worth the money. If it was possible to send it back I would. As it is, I'll live with it for now, but as soon as I can afford to I will replace it. What a hughe disappointment!"
3,Good,"Took a long while to assemble but came out just right. The paint on it comes off very easily though so I'm not satisfied with that. Over all it's good and the drawers are convenient if you're in a small place and do not have room for a dresser. For the price I paid though the paint could stay on better because ANY little thing messes it up and it looks bad. But like I said, overall it serves its purpose. If you are not patient enough to assemble it yourself hire or find someone who is haha."
1,Long Wait-Fell Apart,"The item is decent but not quite as sturdy as I would have liked. It was difficult to put together because we had to drill new holes, they were not drilled properly. The shipping date kept changing. ***UPDATE*** Ugh, the item fell apart - definitely had defects, anyway, VisonDecor was very helpful regarding this matter although the way they use their contact is awful and you feel like it won't go anywhere but they paid to ship the item back and gave me a full refund for the product and shipping costs that I had paid."
1,Bad quality,The worst product ever. Bad quality. The drawers broke after very limited use.So i cant use it and that is the whole point of that bed.
1,Cheap and Looks It,"I would give this zero stars if I could. I purchased two in full-sized with bookcase headboards for a small space where two full-sized beds were needed. These are particle-board covered with plastic ""veneer"" which looks exactly like what it is. It arrived dirty, dusty and pre-dented - the faux-veneer wasn't improved by having divots knocked out of it exposing the particle board underneath. Instead of the matress resting on a platform, there are slats just like any other bed - so calling this a ""platform bed"" is pretty misleading.If I had known the poor quality of this item prior to purchasing, I would not have purchased these. Cheaply made, looks cheap, not sturdy and not a platform."
4,Easy to Assemble,"Sturdy enough when assembled. The Drawers seemed to have cheaper quality than the bed frame, they feel flimsy. Edges are a bit sharp so watch your toes. Fit my Memory Foam King sized bed perfectly."
4,one of the best films of the year.,"This is one of the best films I have seen this year. It is mote known for some sex scenes in the film, but there is a lot more then that to like about this film then that. The director, Alfonso Cuaron, also did A LITTLE PRINCESS, a film you wood not think about when you watch this.Note: do not get the R Rated Verison, it cuts out some sex scenes that help with the film's story line."
5,WOW!!!!,"I saw this little jewel of a movie on the Independent Film Channel. I read the synapseses for the movie, but I was stil somewhat ambivilant about it. Once I started watching it, I quickly realized that this movie was special. The acting, direction, storyline, scripting, all of it was outstanding. I cannot say enough about this movie. Well worth a look if you areopen minded enough to deal with the sex and nudity. This movie is definately destined for my collection.Charlie S."
1,Y tu mama tambien,I turned this off shortly after the first sex scene. I just did not appeal to whatsoever. I would not waste your time on this one!
4,Error in Product Details,"The blurb under DVD Features shows ""Three deleted scenes"" and this is not correct as it applies to the R-rated version, not the unrated one. Very good film, but the dialog is very fast, although the English subtitles are quite accurate. Good story and enjoyable eroticism--it feels more like a docudrama than a film. There's much more to this picture than the sex. I recommend it!"
4,Good film.,"I often wonder if movies in foreign languages are actually good, or if the fact that I can't actually understand the actors covers the horrible acting. Either way, the story behind Y Tu Mama Tambien is an interesting one. While the movie contains frank depictions and descriptions of sexuality and drug use, it still remains a fascinating look at the relationship between two friends and what happens when a beautiful stranger interrupts their routine way of life. I reccommend this film. However if you are squeemish of explicit depictions of sexuality and nudity, it may not be for you."
2,Mexican Beavis & Butthead Incarnate Get Lucky,This movie is mainly a lesson in puerile behavior. The plot was often too vapid or obvious to hold my attention.A positive aspect of the film was that the subtitles teach the student of Spanish some words that most Spanish teachers will probably not bother to teach.
1,"No argument, pure sex","This movie doesn't tell a story, it is all about making easy money by showing sex among some popular mexican a Spanish actors. Don't spend time on this one."
2,Editing has destroyed this great film,"I bought the R rated version of this movie from Amazon after borrowing the film from my local Blockbuster in Australia. I loved the library copy enough to want to own a copy of my own - only to find that the American R certificate version had been so badly edited that the sense of the film had been lost. Yes, the original film is erotic and confronting; the American R certificate version leaves much of the nudity but deletes some crucial footage. For example, in the climactic scene at the beach once the long journey is over, the kiss between Julio and Tenoch ends up on the cutting room floor! Without this, the tension of the following scenes is inexplicable. Try to buy the original and enjoy the whole film. It's refreshingly different, sad and clever."
4,Nitty gritty sex is great!,"I was a bit intimidated by some reviews in advance of seeing this movie because I don't like a lot of superfluous sex in movies. But this was a great film, and the sex was refreshingly appropriate. It features two 17-year-olds, and it's wonderfully lifelike. But the sex scenes are only a minor part of what is a lovely movie. I highly recommend it to all viewers. I want to see it again."
2,Too much hype...,"This movie tries to grab you from two angles: The sexual relationship between the characters and the 'social' commentary. I found both to be extremely bad. My feeling is that this is a softcore film for girls, where you get tons of shots of the two male characters, and the narrator's commentary tries to make you feel as if it were an art film. Definitely not worthy. Coming of age? See The Graduate. Want to see upper class Mexico? Watch Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas."
2,Just another teen-angst movie,"It was OK I guess. The sex was pretty mild and disappointing, after reading all the hoopla. Maybe shocking in the prudish US, but on an absolute scale, there's little sex or nudity really in there, even in this unrated version. That Americans think this is a sexy movie says more about themselves than it does about the movie.This is basically just another teenagers-grow-up movie. Probably will be of interest to those under 30; over 30, forget it. (You can tell which side of that I'm on, ha ha!)The puerile machismo and chauvinism of the two young men was irritating, but perhaps not unusual for the age and culture. It would have been satisfying to see them begin to grow out of it by the end of the movie, but that doesn't happen.What happened to Luisa at the end was a cheap shot."
2,This movie was OK,"Totally not worth the hype. A better choice would be ""Sex and Lucia"" or ""Like Water, For Chocolate"". I spoke with some of my spanish speaking friends whom really loved this film and they said alot is lost in the spanish to english translation. In my humble opinion, a very pointless film surrounded under the shroud of the trite topic of sex. Watch it if you want, like I did out of curiosity and be the judge yourself."
4,Well worth watching,"This is a good film - not great - but worth seeing at least once. And it IS a film - not a movie. For those sharp enough to pick them up, it's full of symbolism and wonderful contrasts, driven by the relationship between the two protagonists and best friends, and the older woman they meet.Once you get used to the style of the film it soon becomes addictive. I couldn't take my eyes off it. There is a gentleness about it, and some poignant and meaningful statements about human life linger just below the surface narrative of sex and adolescent self-discovery.Unlike some reviewers here, I don't find the sight of two teenage boys kissing each other offensive, and so am not willing to damn the film because of its homo-erotic content. This makes it realistic - not a terrible quality in a film."
2,very overrated,wow... young boys who want to have <edited> ...... fascinating stuff. not really. kinda boring.
4,Funny and real,"While some may find the extremely comfortable sexual atmosphere within the film a bit much, the story is so much more important than any nudity. In between sexual scenes is dry humorous dialogue and exposition that make one think about life, about the loss of childhood/teenage innocence, about growing up, about sexuality (and the difference between lust and intimacy), and truth (although, to quote the film, truth is nice but unattainable). The character development and interaction as well as nitty gritty type filming make this a great watch and, for me, read (since I can only understand rudimentary Spanish). If you liked this movie, you may also want to watch Motorcycle Diaries which happens to also star one of the actors in this film. I also recommend viewing the special features. There is a short film and making of featurette that are funny in a dry sort of way."
5,Life,"I can only hope that everyone involved in this movie will go on to have a long and fruitful career. This is the best start that any of them could have gotten.This movie is, to put it simply, about life. I don't believe there's anyone who can't relate this to their own lives. Even though much of the material is shocking to the typical American audience, the director presents in such a realistic way that you realize that yes, this does happen to people.Death, betrayal by friends, drugs, school, coming-of-age, sex, and ultimately an appreciation of life shines through this whole movie. Watch it. Now."
5,hilarious and poignant,"alfonso cuaron is ace. an unforgettable movie featuring supreme acting performances, hilarity, a twist at the end (alright, it was predictable if you watched carefully), social commentary, a brilliant script, unbelievable art direction/cinetography, excellent narration. its a movie lacking bothe in pretension and restraint. PERFECT.a true classic! I'd give it 6 stars if I could."
4,Great ending,"This is a Mexcian film with a surprising degree of depth. Definitely get the unrated version; the ending feels totally different with certain scenes uncut, unlike the R-rated version. These scenes add a good deal to the film's message, one that's delivered with mastery and sincerety. It's a coming-of-age story that you won't forget. I don't find the actress attractive, but she puts up some terrific performance once the trip part of the movie starts. The two actors are excellent as teenage boys from different family backgrounds. One of them sure reminds me of a college dormmate I had and hated... :)A worthy movie for the mature audience."
1,OVERRATED,"I have nothing good to say about this crappy movie. I watched it for free on Amazon, so the only thing wasted was my precious time. I'm surprised it received so many 5-stars. The only redeeming factor was the fact that one of the kids was so grossed out by kissing his male friend that he threw up. I felt the same way watching it."
1,dear god,"so, after the hype & my best friend pleading of me to rent this movie.....i did. it was one of the most dragged out, boring, cliche movies i have ever seen in my entire life. i am far from a conservative prick, but the last thing i wanna see is a load of manjuice being shot into a swimming pool. the story is generic (ooo, best friends discover themselves & eventually grow apart) not to mention the fact that the woman who came along on their ""adventure"" was butt ugly. i enjoy foreign films, but this is an atrocity to not only to foreign films but films in general."
2,A Bit Disappointing.,"After seeing Dirty Dancing Havana Nights I was so excited to see another film with the actor Diego Luna in it so, I went out and rented this film. The story doesn't have a very strong plot line and all the sex in this film is just unnecessary. I watched the rated edition and even that was just over the top. Although, I did love the fact that the film was in another language because the spoken language in this film is absolutely beautiful. To give the actors credit, they did do a good job with the characters they played. I do recommend seeing this film to those who are interested, but it just wasn't my cup of tea."
2,"Soft-core pornography thinly disguised as ""art""","Two high school seniors, one rich, one poor, meet up with a mature late 20's woman who leaves her husband to go on a road trip with the boys. The movie caused stirs on its theatrical release, because, guess what? she ""does it"" with both of them......You will watch this movie, because everyone giggles and tells you to. But you won't feel good about yourself when it's over."
1,Yuk and what was the point?,"I love foreign films and wish I would have done a bit more research before wasting my time on this film. It was disgusting, filled with pornography and bad language, and I have no idea what the point was and I'm an English major. I did not enjoy this movie, and I don't recommend watch it. Yuk."
3,a trip out flick,"this film was anything but predictable. it had a anything goes vibe from start to finish. the Chic in the flick was Banging.the directing of the film was cool.this film is very direct,but yet it throws some curves."
2,edited release,"I was very disappointed on viewing the DVD, first in the General Release Version, then for reasons to follow in the R rated version as well.I had seen the film in the theater and loved it. Was looking forward to the DVD. Unfortunately a key scene near the end of the film was cut short. I won't relate the content, however this was the payoff demonstrating the relationship between the two boys. The denouement, if you will. The payoff is gone.. the film just winds up. I purchased the R rated version, thinking the scene would not be cut short. Wrong. Viewers of either DVD version will not see this key scene. Fortunately the film was shown in its entirety on cable. I cannot recommend this version of the film due to the unfortunate editing in this otherwise fine film."
2,censors!,"Here's a letter I wrote to MGM (moral of the story: don't get the r-rated version!)Dear MGM,I think it is quite disgusting that you released a cut version of Y Tu Mama Tambien onto DVD. I accidentally purchased this abomination!The director chose a vision and cut and edited his own movie, and simply by your own skewed morality, you decide to edit out scenes that may be ""questionable"" to certain people.Let me suggest this: if something is ""questionable"" people can choose to rent it. It's called America! You mention that you have it in ""widescreen"" because of the director's vision. What about cutting parts of the movie because of your own hysterical censorship?On the back of the box, you highlight a prominent blurb from the new york times that states ""Fast, funny, unafraid of sexuality."" If only that could be applied to MGM!This movie is a wonderful story about coming of age in Mexico, and I for one believe it's awful that you edited to suit your own diluted tastes."
2,cute youth,"It was an entertaining movie. I was tense during the movie, expecting some horrible event while they were traveling by car to remote places. I must say I was happy that nothing bad happened. The armed police or guerilla-like people on the road side made me unueasy.It is definetely not a ""must see movie."""
4,Great but not life-altering,"This film was wonderful and very erotic -- an excellent choice for a quiet night at home with your sweetheart and take-out chinese food. But, unlike ""New Sex Now"" it did not change my life beyond all recognition."
5,FABULOUS MOVIE,"I sat down to watch this movie having no idea what it was about, or what had been said about it - I vaguely even remember it being released. Anyway, this was by far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time: funny, sexy and tragic, all at one and the same time. It was one of those movies that makes you feel sad when it's over because you just want it to continue."
2,Highly overrated and tedious,"I had heard so much about this movie that I was shocked that it was so boring and pretentious. This movie has been done to death. Two very spoiled thoughtless young boys go on a trip with a very unhappy young woman and have sex together.Possible spoiler (for what, I don't know): Boys admit they slept with the others' girlfriends; wife falls to pieces because her drunk husband calls and admits he was unfaithful. As for being about poverty, that's a crock. Oh the voice speaks about the plight of the fisherman but it seems our three characters don't really care."
1,IT COULDN'T BE ANY WORSE!,"I was so dissapointed with this movie. I would like to know why they decided to promote this piece of junk. So much hype. There is no drama, no point of interest in the movie. A long road to the beach? I could grag a camera and go to the beach and make it better than this.Don't be deceived with the title, it does not have anything to do with the movie. It is so unfortunate, I mean the best part of the movie is just watching the pigs running next to the beach. I could have seen that somewhere else!. ..."
3,Good but disappointing,"This is, by all means, a good movie. Good actors, good music, good photography. But I find it hard to classify it as erotic.... ... Reading the editorial review and the award nominations, I thought this would be a good choice.This movie, however, is about an unhappy woman who runs off with two teenage boys after she learns that her husband is cheating on her. On several occasions, we see her crying by herself. She is sad, lonely, disillusioned. ...I must admit that some scenes were more pleasing than others. The encounter between one of the boys and the woman in the motel room after the boy's shower was particularly exciting. ... the opening scene or in the car, or the two boys kissing, were far from ""erotic"" to me. And, again, all of this is happening because this woman has been rejected and it's difficult to forget that as you are watching.I guess you have to be mindful of why you are buying this movie."
1,wayne's world is better,"I don't get the hype around this one. Maybe its lost in the translation to the subtitles since I don't understand Spanish. this is bad trash. It also pushes smoking. The only time there's not a cigarette in someone's mouth is when they're in the water.I keep trying to rate this no stars, but the review form will only let me go to 1 star. its a zero!"
1,Garbage,I thought this film was garbage. The only thing good about this film was seeing Mexico's beautiful countryside and beaches. Don't waste your money!
2,Overated!,"This film is mediocre at best. It's no where near other recent potent Mexico City flicks such as ""Amores Perros"" or ""Todo El Poder"". It is rather graphic in its sexual content, so it is not recommended for a young viewing audience. It does have it's funny moments, which save the film from being a complete waste of time. The film is about 2 young men taking a roadtrip with an attractive older woman hoping to get laid, eventually each one gets his wish fulfilled. The film gets it's name from a scene in the film when all 3 are having dinner and the 2 guys start joking about women they've ""had"" including each others' girlfriend then one of them says ""and your mom too"" implying he slept with his friends' mother. Overall, i recommend it to adult and mature audiences and would only really be suitable for one of those evenings in which there is nothing to do and just wish to kill time."
3,i'm without words,"i don't know what to say... this movie is so full of sex it's crazy. i'm not even sure what the main idea of the story was... it just seemed like ... it just doesn't make sense, it's almost like one person wrote a section and someone else continued that section and so on all the while sticking in clumsy and akward sex scenes along the way (Diego is like a stiff robot and is obviously uncomfortable while performing, almost with a fear of the audience seeing anything other than his butt). the ending is such a let down... you'd think that after all that went on things would turn out one way but they turn out completely differently and then someone kicks the bucket on top of that.... this is a death that really does come out of nowhere... what were the writers thinking? despite the odd flow of the story it does in a twisted way make you want to see what happens next. only watch this if there's nothing else interesting on."
2,Disappointed,"This movie was hyped by the US press as a blockbuster among foreign films. Boy was I disappointed! The two main characters, Julio and Tenoch, are spoiled brats of the Mexican upper class. They meet Luisa, a beautiful lady with an aloof husband, and con her into taking a road trip with them. They then bicker, bully and tease each other incessantly, until both Luisa and you, the viewer want to pummel them. When they do kiss and make up for a threesome, the boys are more into each other than they are Luisa. But I was genuinely sad at the film's end. Luisa's fate is a cruel blow. If you like annoying, homoerotic protagonists, this is the film for you."
4,Too Bad All Anyone Talks About Is the Sex.,"This is a fantastic, moving film. All anyone mentions about it is the graphic sex, and that's too bad. The story is powerful, the footage is impressive, and this is altogether a movie worth watching."
1,R-rated edition is vandalized,"Do not get the R-rated version: almost all of the ""wildly erotic"" material has been cut. The movie makes no sense without these scenes."
2,Stick to the unrated version.,"I accidentally rented the ""R rated"" version of the movie this weekend after having seen the uncut movie in the theatres. I wasn't surprised that some of the scenes and dialogue were tamed down (though I was disappointed in whatwill and will not fit into an ""R"" rating these days), but Iwas outraged to find that the movie's most pivotal scene was essentially cut, changing the overall meaning and (to me) main point of the film. Don't waste your time, stick to the unrated version. Not because you're sex-obsessed but because you want the story, characters, and themes that were intended, not that one that met the censors' standards. (PS, the unrated version also hasbetter bonus features)."
1,Vastly over-rated road movie,"This vastly overrated exercise in boredom starred some of the most boring and repulsive people I could ever imagine being in the same car with. You've seen much better on MTV's ""Road Rules."" Why the two young studs are attracted to the femme character is a mystery. She's loud, temperamental, manipulative and totally unattractive. For some reason, the big shock moment is when the two guys actually kiss each other. Wow. Big trauma. There's little plot, just grubby, bare-bones budgets and lots of traveling over the backroads of Mexico."
3,missed opportunity,"bit of a dissapointment, this one. i was expecting great things but got a story which is too silly to be realistic and not symbolic enough to be abstract. beautiful camera work, though. and sex scenes are both hot and funny. nicely embedded social comments, too. all in all, sort of a missed opportunity. 3 stars."
1,Disgusting,"Not one who is usually disturbed by sex, nudity, etc, I found this movie to be disgusting and almost turned it off during the first scene. I had heard from many people what a work of art this movie is, but I found it to be nothing but porn. I could not believe that such a movie could be in any section in the video store short of pornography, but there it is, on the shelf like a regular movie. It is pure [garbage]."
2,"Preach on, Brother Cuaron","Alfonso Cuaron is one of the four ""Mexican Powers-that-be"" in Hollywood. He and his buddies Gonzalez Iñarritu, Rodiguez, and Mandoki have a ""mafia-style"" business agreement in which they decide who can work in their films, and mostly block other Mexicans from their projects.Regardless, this movie is too preachy, too sleek, and too much of a copy of road movies of yore. It's bland and has no real storyline except teenage sex (poorly acted). The only redeeming factor is the photography and the resemblance to ""Run Lola, Run."""
1,I turned it off.,"It says, ""Unrated"" which turned out to mean a very R or even an X. After watching the opening scene with nudity and intercourse between two young people, I thought it might improve. But apparently the lead characters couldn't open their mouths without saying multiple swear words, especially the F word.I am using movies to improve my Spanish...and I don't need to know that language. And with the title, I could figure out what was going to happen next.Not at all my style."
4,Intense and fun!,Nice movie. Full of interesting passages. We can see the truly countryside of Mexico and its culture. The spanish language used is hard to understand specially because of the slang used. Very nice and intricate history.
5,Perfect blend of drama and hilarity,"This is one of the best movies I've seen, period. First of all, Gael Garcia Bernal is a great (and great-looking) actor, especially in a role such as this. The transition from boyhood to manhood is a favorite topic of directors, but often the subject is treated with sentimental extremes. It is rare to find a coming-of-age film that is neither heavy with drama (such as ""The Graduate"") nor reduced to nonstop slapstick ... gags (like ""American Pie"", which was an enjoyable comedy but certainly not art). ""Y tu Mama Tambien"" treads with ease the line between farce and melodrama. It sensitively but candidly addresses issues such as friendship, competition, social politics and the male ego while offering up a steady stream of laughs. Gael Garcia Bernal once again proves himself one of today's finer young actors on either side of the U.S.-Mexican border (and, in my humble, crush-tainted view, in the entire world)."
5,y tu mama ......tambien,"This movie,is good movie because the movie shows how important is enjoy your life,because you never know when you will died,so lets see this incredible history of love."
1,One of the biggest cinematic disappointments,"I was so excited about this film. I heard great things not just from critics, but from regular people. I just kept waiting for a point when I could feel something for the characters, but it never came. I didn't just dislike them, they flat-out irritated me. Not only were the characters exploitive and undeveloped, there wasn't much interesting about this film at all. Near the beginning, the two best friends masturbate together while talking about the wife of one of their cousins. I almost stopped it right then, but made the mistake of wasting more of my time. It basically was softcore porn, but worst because it was supposed to be a serious movie. This whole story was about sex and cheating, and not giving much forethought to either of these things. It tried to make it seem like it had a lot more going for it, but failed miserably.If you like mindless, sexually exploitive movies that parade as meaningful films, you'll love this one."
5,Sex is not taboo.,"I loved this movie, and yes, it needed to have all that sex, why? because this movie involved two themes, coming out of age, and someone dying and trying to live their life, so why not have all that sex? The way this movie was structured was just beautiful, how everything in the movie seemed to play an important role, not just the characters, but the minor characters as well. I also loved the scenes from Mexico, where it wasn't mainly Mexico D.F, but the rest of the country, which a lot of the time is overlooked in films."
4,"memorable, compelling film","I am not ""big"" into sub-titled movies, but that said I really thought this was an outstanding film. It is well written, well acted, cinematically holds your attention, and is exceptionally well acted. It explores universal themes of lust, jealousy, betrayal, and friendship. The sex scenes are not gratuitous, though they are explicit (and that's not a bad thing). The other reviews on this site go deeper into the plot and storyline, so I won't bore you by repeating them.I will tell you that this is a very, very good movie, and that I recommend it highly and without reservation."
3,A Virtual Experience of Mexico,This movie is a sensual virtual trip of Mexico. For many people this is about as close as they will get to experiencing the total beauty of Mexico without actually going there. It is also a glimpse into the lives of young Mexicans couping with modern conversions. This movie is a must for the adventurious who do not mind seeing the edge of society.
1,Crushed goods,"Friend bought stroopwafels from Amsterdam and I fell in love.Decided to buy 2 orders of these for the holidays, for myself and as gifts.What a horrible purchase1) They did not taste as good as the one's from Europe even though it's made in Holland as the wrapper says. Not enough of the cookie part. I felt like I was eating caramel candy shaped like a cookie.2) Wow who packs these things? The 20 stroopwafels doesn't even fit in the box they give you. The box was way too small. They were squished, crushed, broken. I was too embarassed to give them as gifts. Put them in a bigger box. Don't force then in!3) The package says best before date, but there was no legible expiration date to be found.Thanks for ruining my 2nd experience with stroopwafels"
4,love these!,"I am def going to buy these again! maybe this time I will let others try one! a friend introduced me when she visited Amsterdam, she did share when she got home!"
3,Not as described,"This item is designed to sit on top of the standard size coffee cup - however, this brand is not large enough to do so and the stroopwafel falls into the cup. The purpose of placing this item on top of the cup is to allow the hot beverage to soften it to fully enjoy the caramel flavor. I had purchased some of these wonderful waffels from ALDI FOODS last year and the size was perfect. Unfortunately ALDI is not offering this item this year. I found them on AMAZON, but the size of the stroopwafel is too small and these just did not do it. They are too small and fall into the hot liquid."
5,"mmm, nom, nom, nom","It's almost completely butter. Come on. Soo good. But you have to earn it or the guilt gnomes will give you grief. Earn it. Then, treat yourself. So, so good."
2,Toner ran out in 2 months,"I bought this less than 2 months ago and though I am generally happy with the product itself, the toner cartridge has run out with less than 800 pages of use. Amazon support is telling me that the cartridges shipped with the product are of inferior quality than the ones we purchase subsequently, which sounds very fishy to me. I am checking with Brother also. I can't believe I have to spend another $130 on a new toner after 2 months of very casual use."
5,Our MFC-8440 has withstood some stress:,"My company bought this machine in the hopes that we could take our archived paper documents and convert them into usable digital files.18,000+ scanned pages later, this machine is still working like the day we picked it up and it has yet to show us any problems. We use the software provided coupled with Adobe Acrobat Professional and we have an excellent workable product.We use this machine for a network fax, copier and scanner and we REALLY use it. Hundreds of faxes out and in each day and frequent scanning. I think its been about a year now.Its larger than some of the other MFC's on the market but that is the only really con I have for this product."
2,It made it 1.5 years... So long...,"Well,we had liked this product for the 1.5 years that it worked.... We are sending it back under the replacement warranty that we purchased. It now sounds like an old vehicle clunking down the road. It was used relatively lightly for printing and fax in our small office."
2,Absolute sludge,"Printing, initially okay. Resolution, so-so. By far, the biggest disappointment is the scanner. I tried scanning a 7 page document...several times. It retains only the last page. To send the document via scanned document, I would have had to scan each page - 7 attachments for 1 document. I don't think so."
3,Dissapointed,I bought this item as the replacement speakers for my lexus IS. I was very dissapointed. They did not deliver the base i expected. I now use them for voice and mid base in my system. I use an electionic crossover in my amplifier to remove the lower frequencies.Dont expect the boom from this model.
5,Excellent to Color and Read,"Kids of all ages should love this book. It is historically accurate, and the pictures are easy to color. Just have a lot of ""sand"" type colors available. The art work is excellent, and the resulting pictures can look really ""spiffy"" if you use bright colors. There is a nice spectrum of subjects, dealing with everyday life, to nobles & royalty, famous battles, mummies, and ending with Cleopatra meeting Ceasar. A really neat book for the price."
5,Surprisingly well done,"Despite the funky name and cover art, this has become a favorite. There are selections not included on other collections, and they are so beautifully executed. The ""Vocalise"" is utterly entrancing."
5,"""The Search for Marvin Gardens"" by itself is worth the print price","I had The John McPhee Reader years ago and I'd forgotten how good he is. Any aspiring essayist, writer of creative nonfiction, journalism students or anyone who wants to see examples of writing at it's best should be required to read this collection."
4,"Interesting, but...","This book is definitely interesting. But, I am amazed at how conveniently Rorty fits the philosophies of Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and others into his pragmatic ethnocentrism. It seems that he is using them to help make his own philosophy more compelling, rather than just telling stories about them. But, of course he would do that. Well, anyway, don't be decieved. He is using them for the purpose of propagating his own views. Also, he has a ""straw-god"" argument against the God of the Bible. When he speaks of ""type A entities,"" all he is talking about is a primus inter pares, not a Transcendental. Interesting kibitzing, though. A good read for philosophasters like myself."
1,a very poor effort,"This is the work of a filing clerk and a minor commentator on the ideas of others. Science reveals the 'actuality' and the real effects of external forces and processes every day, and the notion that we can have no perceptual grasp of these other than that provided by linguistic representation is just plain wrong. Dr. Johnson kicked a table in disgust at Berkely's Idealist drivel, to which Rorty is the heir, and it would be nice to hear a lot more tables being kicked across the Western world. In this collection Rorty tackles the ideas of sophisticated European philosphers with all the finesse and subtelty of the Incredible Hulk. This position is becoming rapidly obsolete, so let's not become members of Rorty's 'community of ironic geniuses' and move on."
2,Movie is Entertaining; DVD Quality is Extremely Poor,"The movie is good, but this particular dvd is extremely poor, worse than you think. It definitely isn't worth the $5 I paid for it."
4,Boy in the plastic bubble,I havent seen this for years but when I sat down and watched it again it was amazing to see how far medicine has come today and fashion hahaJohn Travolta fans would like this he was great in this movie recommend it as a definite rainy night movie in
4,really good,"i bought this movie before i rented it because john travolta is cool.then i thought it would be kinda stupid because it was on sale for only $2.00.but i decided i would try to live through it.a little boring at times,but the ending sorta made it all worth while"
3,Bubble-tastic,"I saw this on the cool TV1 as the weeks' featured ""Groovy Movie."" I wanted to see it because Mary Katherine Gallagher had performed a monologue from the film! It was pretty good and fun to watch, with a few laughs. Not meant to be funny, but JT's 70's hat was a cack, as was the sight of him running on the beach in an astronaut's suit. It was of course sad too, because he lived such an abnormal life. I was sooo frustrated though, cos the video I taped it on cut out just before the end, so I don't know what happened! Then I check out all the other reviews and they're raving about how great an ending it was! Unbelievable!"
3,ok,Remembered this movie from when I much younger. Couldn't wait to add it to my collection. very good quality. thanks
3,The Boy In The Plastic Bubble,"I remember watching this movie on television when I was a little girl. I cried like a baby, then.When I watch it now, a tear still comes to my eye because of the ""overall"" meaning.Being done in the 1970's, the quality is less than perfect and the sound is distorted. However, since I remember it when I was younger, it holds my interest until the end.The end? Which I always thought was a disappointment, they never stated what happened to him. It took me several hours of research to find out what happened to the real ""Boy In The Plastic Bubble."" For those of you who would like to know: His real name was ""David Vetter."" He died at age 12 from a bone marrow transplant.I would recommend this movie for persons who remember watching it when they were younger or for people who are interested in SCID. (Severe Combined Immune Deficiency)"
2,"Great story, low quality dvd but worth purchasing","It is great to see this movie again after so many years. The story is still great.The quality of the DVD is not great but for the low price and a great story it is worth the purchase.The quality of the picture is very old, poor quality. It looks as if the master copy did not age very well. There is also a bad spot in the software and about 1 minute of the film is scrambled. The DVD package is a simple cardbord box and plastic insert.A good economic purchase."
3,Good Movie,This is a good movie. John Travola as usual is suberb! Okay I agree that the anonymous reviewer from Nov 23 2004 was a bit harsh about the anonymous review from April 12 2004 but I also get the impression that that reviewer thought that perhaps the movie was about HIV because that is all they talked about but I don't think the person meant anything bad by it. I would have to that he or she Wasn't trying to offend anyone!
3,Good I guess,I really ordered this one for my sister. I never really watched it. But She loves it So I guess its ok.
1,Waste of time and money,"I purchased this book after much thought and deliberation. I followed it exactly as it said to do it. My house was worth around $180k, so I started my bidding at $99.5k. After the open house, I had a list of 8 people who wanted to bid. Can you believe 3 people actually thought they could get the house for around $100k? When they learned the couldn't, they droppde out of the bidding. So down to 5 now. Three more dropped out by the time we got to $120k. Then one more dropped out at $140k. So according to Bill Effros, my house is worth $140k and I should sell it to the highest bidder. That's a bunch of BS! This book just doesn't work."
4,THIS SELLING METHOD WORKS,I recently sold my winter home in Georgia using Wm. Effros's 5 Day Method. I guess a lot of things in life that have been learned by trial and error are quite valuable. I like the large print and plenty of white space in the book for notes. My congratulations to the author and publisher!
4,Method works with a little updating,"I sold my San Francisco condo using this method at market price.I netted $30-$40k more than if I were to have sold it using the conventional method paying a 5-6% broker commision. Here are the updates I would suggest:1. use a website service - George Cappony's 5-daysale.com does a great job. The website service should include a way to track the number of hits.2. If you use a website, expect fewer calls (most people I talked to said they got 5-10). The website does the work for you, and you don't have to be at home to answer calls.3. Use a minimum undisclosed reserve price to protect yourself. This should be what you think is market price minus the 6% commission you would normally pay. Then make the listing price REALLY low. If people don't say your price is ridiculous, then drop it even more.4. Place your newspaper ad for 8 days instead of 5 days. Most people only read the Sunday paper, so if you start the previous Sunday, you will get maximum marketing exposure."
4,Great info but a little dated,"The concept is great, and I did sell the house in 5 days. Still waiting on closing which is in 2 weeks.He doesn't promote the internet, which is an absolute must now! I made my own website with all the details, and directed all my advertising there. Worked like a charm and I had over 400 hits to the site in the 5 days.Worth the inexpesive price just to learn the basics."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!!!,"The advice in this book SUCKS! Before I bought, read and attempted this ""new idea"", I came and read the reviews posted on this website. I saw more positive reviews than negative so I figured that it was just negative people writing the bad ones. No, they were probably the only ones that are not personal friends with the author.I had my property listed at $60,000 below market value. Because my local paper was running a special, I had my ad in the paper for over two weeks. In that two weeks, I had only 19 people call about the ad. And the majority of them were investors looking for a good deal thinking that they were going to get a great place at next to nothing.Again, DO NOT waste your money on this book. It is like taking that money and flushing it down the toilet with the rest of the crap. Caveat Emptor!!!"
2,"Some good selling tips, but concept could be dangerous","I helped a good friend for several weeks using the concepts in this book trying to sell his waterfront home. No luck. Not even low offers. The author says to advertise that ""the home will be sold to the highest bidder in 5 days."" If the highest offer is unacceptably low, can the high bidder sue if it is rejected? After weeks of frustration, my friend listed with an agent and sold within 2 weeks. There are better by-owner guides available."
1,where will this work?,I had great hopes for this. Ran ads as they said and it costs us hundreds!Not one called and not one person showed! Total waste of time and money. I'd like to know where this really works!
1,Sellers beware- pitfalls with the process recommended,"This is a very simplistic approach to a complex transaction. The attorney we consulted told us to stay away from a seller using this method. There are many issues involved, depending on the state. I agree with the seller's objectives, but there may be better qualified buyers that you may be missing..."
5,THE VERY BEST TAPE PROGRAM EVER PRODUCED!!!,"No tape program explains what it takes to get to the top better than this one. Nobody explains it better than Brian Tracy. If you're looking for one tape program that explains what makes us tick,this is the one. Highly Recommended!!"
5,No complaints here !!!,"Great!!! Psychology of Achievement, the AUDIO CASSETTES these were exactly what I was looking for and expected. Our transaction went off without a hitch! I would use this vendor anytime as actions speak much louder than words.Excellent A +++ Thank you, Jeff"
3,This movie is based in a real life event,"This is the story of a foreign journalist who returns to Laos to rescue the woman he loves and was forced to leave behind. He had been in prison and tortured by the Communist regime one year earlier, convicted of being a spy, but he is willing to risk his life to get reunited with his true love. The story is beautiful but I must say the movie is kind of slow. However, it's worth it. Michael Landon is the main character and he is an excellent actor."
3,love is forever,"I READ REVIEWS FROM PREVIOUS RELEASES ON THIS MOVIE AND QUALITY WAS NOT VERY GOOD. BEING THIS RELEASED IN 2007 HOPING IT WOULD BE BETTER QUALITY IT WAS NOT. THE PICTURE AND SOUND WAS BAD. I HAVE A VCR TAPE THAT I RECORDED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN IT PLAYED ON TV. THE QUALITY WAS FAR BETTER THEN THE DVD! BASED ON A TRUE STORY I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE.MY FAVORITE MOVIES "" NOTEBOOK"", ""SOMEWHERE IN TIME"", ""THE FOUR FEATHERS"" (1977)."
2,"excellent movie, poor quality video.","while we enjoyed the movie i.e. plot, stars, story very much, the quality of the video was very poor. It appeared to have been taped from a tv show (swear words bleeped out, spots where commercials had been edited out) onto vhs and then transferred to dvd. The sound was very muffled, sometimes very difficult to hear, and the picture was very grainy and fuzzy."
1,Disappointed,"The quality of this DVD was very disappointing as it was very grainy and had poor colour. The movie itself was quite good, but it was quality of the print that let it down."
3,Hollywood version of real events,"I know a few of the principal characters depicted in this film, including Everingham. It's amusing to see how H'wood boils the story down to the elements it finds most marketable. The real story is actually much more byzantine and complex, and would have made a good thriller. This is more a love story.The actress who plays Everingham's Lao wife is Laura Gemser, a Dutch citizen of Indonesian descent who was well-known at the time for her porn films, most notably a few in the Emmanuelle series (incl Black Emmnuelle, Emanuelle and the Cannibals). It's said that director Hall Bartlett insisted she use a pseudonym for this reason, ""Moira Chen."" Even on the set he allegedly forbade the cast and crew from calling her by her real name."
3,Watch it for Michael Landon,Poor quality DVD image. But it is a nice and unusual role for Michael Landon. His fans will enjoy the movie. I did!
2,love is forever,i bought this dvd from synegery and it is a poor quality of this movie. you cannot understand what they are sayong and tj color is terrible. i will not buy anything else from them
5,Baby bugs,"My daughter loves these bugs! They are a little larger than I thought (maybe 6"" long), but are a good value at 3 for under ten bucks for what's packed in them. 2 of them have crinkly wings and rattles inside; all 3 have a little teether plastic piece and a place to attach to links. I keep one in her diaper bag and it's a good way to distract her in a pinch."
4,"Good, but not for a long time","I gave these bees to my baby when she was 3 month old, They are light enough for her to practice lifting, plus the bright color and rattle sounds keep her interested. I also love that these are teether toys although my baby didn't use them much. But at 7-8 month old, She will have nothing to do with them."
2,Not bad... but not good...,"I like Karen Voight's more recent videos, so I decided to give this one a shot. I've been doing the Firm for quite a while and I was looking for something a little more advanced. I didn't really find that here. You need to buy ankle and thigh weights, but the squats and such are done without weight. The repetition without weights did make it challenging -- more so than I expected.Unfortunately, they've crammed too many people into the workout space, and they are all dressed in brilliant 80's colors. The music is also pretty 80's (weird sax--those who were around will recognize it when they hear it). Karen's instruction is quite good and this tape is effective. Despite her talent, however, this isn't one of her best."
3,Ample yet deep,"This is a decent attempt to explain the inner workings of the evil one. There isn't really much here that you can't get in the Bible and there are certainly better texts out there on the subject (if you really want an inside look at the enemy, check out The Screwtape Letters).I was engaged at the outset, but soon found I was drifting out into the sea of ""what the heck am I reading"" as I feel the author gets a bit lost in his explanations and descriptions (much like my reviews). I gave it three stars for effort, to give less would be unfair as anyone who can get a book to market is worthy of some chance at a life and a plank. To give it more than three would mean it was written by my brother-in-law and I was making an attempt to swell his endurance in the marketplace. Now there's something Satan would do, eh?"
4,Electric Prunes - 'California' (Prune Twang),"A worthy 2004 Electric Prunes release. Thirty-seven light years after the initial pressing of their late '60's debut lp 'I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night', it's evident with 'California' that with three original members - vocalist James Lowe, guitarist Ken Williams and bassist Mark Tulin (R.I.P.) hasn't lost much (if any) of their magic at all. Tracks that make this latter day Prunes CD a keeper are ""49 Songs"", ""I Never Knew What You Wanted"", their Tom Petty cover ""Makin' Some Noise"", the rocking ""Pacific Ocean Blue"", ""Running With Scissors"" (definitely has a '60's vibe to it) and ""The Rickenbacker 12 String"". Wanted to mention that when this disc first came out, I remember reading in some 'zine review that 'California' had reminded that specific critic a lot of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers. I can see that."
2,Disappointing after some reads,"We enjoyed the book initially, but it is flimsily constructed and falls apart easily, even without baby hands grabbing at it. Because of that, we don't read the book much anymore, and I wouldn't recommend it. Disappointing as it was good at first."
1,Not one of our favorites,"I was really disappointed with this book. I did not like the illustrations or story line. My son never had an interest in this one either. With so many great other choices for pop up books, I would recommend thye Chuck Murphy pop up series, those really held my son's interest."
5,A must read,"I highly recommend Irresistible Attraction. Being single again after many years made me doubt myself in several ways. This encouraging book with its insightful ideas and true stories weaved into the chapters by both Mary Lee and Kevin made it seem so real and the concepts so basic-yet so important! Yes, now I feel totally irresistible! A great read, a must read -- for anyone who wants to be more attractive -- and don't we all? I've read it twice already!"
3,average book. nothing special.,"this book just give you the facts on how to communicate for first impression. it emphasize alot on nonverbal communication and how to communicate verbally for positive response. most of the stuff that is explained is common sense that is natural to people who get along with others easily. it talks alot about the characteristics needed to be chrismatic but don't tell you how. your told to have self esteem, have a life, be interesting, etc. it then also talks about how to act on dates or communicate to her. this isn't my choice of book for learning charisma since i feel that i am reviewing my understandings about nonverbal communication. this book isn't a keeper in my opinion because there are very little exercises to build one's charisma. there are better books out on nonverbal communication that allows you to be more flexible such as nonverbal communication:form and function by peter andersen. atleast read kevin's book."
2,Well Short,"I bought this book because it got good ratings. I was disappointed because like the other reviewers mentioned there were a lot of grammatical mistakes. Also, the exclamation point is way overused!! :)I did learn a few new interesting tidbits. The beginning is interesting because it backs up its advice using scientific data. But as it progresses the book reads more like an advice column. The advice is good, most of it common sense, but none of it supported by any studies.I wish there were more books on charisma, unfortunately I haven't found one yet."
5,the business of getting down,"This book is not just for people who want to get laid, it's actually very useful for people who want to improve their business communication skills. Because the core of any successful business nowadays is positive peer and client communication.I'm a fairly quiet person and I don't particularly like people, but in order to succeed, I realize I must have some form of social skills and Kevin Hogan gives out solid, easy to read, information.This isn't the kind of book where you read once and toss it, this is a guide book that I have been going back to whenever I need to polish up my people skills.There are several books with similar subject matter, but this is the one you need to buy. This information is not dated."
2,Average Common Sense Book,I was disappointed in reading this book which really provided no real insight or differentiation. A lot of pages of repetition making the book longer to read with the same material throughout.
2,If you are having relationship problem!!!!,"I found this book started off all right and Whoa! It went into relationship help and how to create a better communication strategy between an existing relationship. When I bought this book I thought that it would cover such things as charisma building and getting people to gain a better judgment of you when you first meet the person. As they say first impressions last. But no, it went off into a tangent and I found it hard to keep reading with out getting bored.Other then that a satisfactory book."
2,Could've Been Better,"This book isn't horrible. There ARE some gems in it. The reason why ""IA"" gets the low rating is because there is SO MUCH FLUFF!!! He could've done better. There are some internet blogs that offer more content than this book. Just type the word charisma in your search engine. If you just NEED a book, Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" should do it."
1,Waste of time,"This is just a manual for psychopaths. How to dress and what makeup to wear, what kind of smile to use, what feelings to display? Come on... Unless you were raised by wolves or another psychopath, this is just a waste of time and money. I guess you can sell anything in this country, even crap like this. Can I have my money back?"
1,CRAP,This is not a PUA book. It is written by a 60 year old lady who was a therapist like 100 years ago. This book will not help you get laid in 2011. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,"Sloppy, hurried effort","This book does contain some useful suggestions and a superficial review of some psychological studies. It also contains spelling and grammatical errors, a number of meaningless sentences and poorly structured paragraphs. It bears the hallmarks of a hurried first draft and the editors should be ashamed. At least the authors bothered to gather some material together in a loose structure. The editor appears to have abdicated his responsibilities altogether. Try something by Leil Lowndes. She tends to be a bit too breezy for my tastes, but, at least she has made an apparent effort to provide value to the reader."
5,"GREAT book! Fun, easy, smart, sexy!","This book surprised me. I thought it might be all fluff but it's actually all meat. Hogan writes clearly and the insights are worth millions. Anyone looking for ways to add a little charm and radiance to their personality ought to read this book. Heck, ALL of us need it! -- joe Vitale ..."
5,"Incredible, a must-buy","Few books summarize years and years of psychological research into relationship as well as this one. Both easy to read and filled with wonderful examples, you'll have a rough time putting this book down. In fact, once I finished reading it, I picked it up again and started reading through once more, highlighting all the great parts. On my top 5 psych/influence/sales books of all time."
2,Disappointed by common sense material,"I was honestly expecting to enjoy this book very much but was completely disappointed by the level of information that was offered in the text. There aren't many actual ""secrets"" of personal magnetism here because most of the strategies are based completely on common sense. Things like keeping eye contact and engaging another person by asking them questions does indeed work, but you can find these ideas in an average article in Men's Health or Cosmo. A full-length book was not required for the ideas in this book. I would admit that this book could be helpful for someone just beginning to explore interpersonal communications, but if you have any experience whatsoever, you will not find much depth here. I was also distracted by several editorial errors where the wrong words were used in a sentence, or they were left out completely. It just pushed the book over the edge of appearing simple and not based on much quality work."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book repeats itself a lot, has numerous grammatical errors, and has some of the most dated information of any book I've ever read on this topic. It's like the author(s) got bored with the project when writing it, and just began re-stating a lot of the ideas they had already covered. Oh yeah, and even the illustrations are of very poor quality!"
4,Irresistible read.,"This book was recommended to me by Amazon; after reading a few comments I was curious as to way this book got such high marks. I've read quite a few books on attraction, and I have to say this book does a great job of synthesizing a lot of the information your likely to come across. I had the luck of just finishing The Evolution of Desire by David Buss, which happens to be in the bibliography. I saw key elements of Buss' book simplified for easier reading. I have no doubt that Irresistible Attraction simplifies other sources in the same manner. The book, though not original contains a lot of useful information about attraction and personal magnetism."
1,Regurgitating other research,"Hogan just does a little quick research in the academic specialized publications, restates the findings without adding any insight or experience, records and transcribes the recording (with little to no editing) and voila, here's another less than valuable book. Stick to cialdini, knowles, and the real experts who are doing real research and development. Hogan is a profiteer who adds little to no value."
3,Pretty Good,"This book wasn't the best book, but it was pretty good. The Halliwells go for a vacation to New Orlenes, and get involved with voodoo. It's not a must read, but if you like Charmed, this book is for you!"
2,Halliwells In New Orleans,"During the ""Charmed"" series, when Prue was still head Halliwell witch, the sisters didn't venture away from the manor or San Francisco; trips to heaven, hell and other dimensions excluded. I had high expectations that ""Voodoo Moon"" would be a fun romp with high jinks galore when the Halliwell sisters are slapped in the head with Cajun culture. The novel wasn't fun and the characters were not true to the series. There was no mention of Leo. Piper and Phoebe seemed lost and lacking in confidence next to Prue. Phoebe has been a free spirit throughout the series, but in this novel, she doesn't shine. The voodoo practices seemed authentic, but it didn't blend well with the Power of Three. Magic power was lacking throughout the story and to sum it up, ""Voodoo Moon"" was mainly about three sisters having a terrible vacation in New Orleans."
4,good but not great,this is a good charmed book but its not up there with the best i'm afraid. it's set in new orleans which is a good change the book does have many twist which leave unsure whose the badie but for some reason this book never really worked for me i think it was the ending because the big end fight really isn't that big or climactic. but if your a fan it's a good read
5,a nice vacation in new orleans,"the 3 haliwell sisters are looking forward to their trip to neworleans. but something sinister seems to happen from the beginning. prue nearly misses the flight, they have no hotelreservations, and all the hotels are booked. when a young womanoffers them rooms at a country hotel that is just outside of neworleans, this seems like the ideal place. but from the beginning, evil lurks around every corner. the charmed ones findthat they can run but they can't hide as they deal with old black magic in the heart of the voodoo capital. this book isquite good and definitely a must for all charmed fans."
4,Voodoo moon,this book was sooo good i cont get to put is down . i am not a book person but a charmed one and sienc i love the show i just might love the books too!
5,Nixon & Cronies Busted,"The topic is timeless and should never be forgotten. The medium is dated, but the dial phones & general inefficiency of communicating adds suspense."
3,Memories,A good movie about the unfolding of the Watergate scandal. I bought this movie to show to my classroom... but their generation was easily bored because of the lack of show-effects...
3,DVD Purchase,"The DVD arrived in good shape, but it took a long for time for shipping even though the web page said it would be shipped in 1-2 days. I ordered a book from another vendor at the same time and had already received the book and finished reading it before I even got a notice that the DVD was shipping."
2,Not what I expected,"All the President's Men is likely a great movie for those who are interested in the process of jounalism. However, those who expect to ""see"" the Watergate scandal unfold may be very dissapointed. At some points in the film I felt like Watergate was really the sublot and ""how news stories are developed"" was the plot. This was not what I expected nor desired when purchasing All the President's Men."
1,All the President's Men,I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD. I had to turn up the volume all the way and it was barely loud enough. Also the quality of the picture was poor.
3,All the President's Men,"As many others American Movies, as self criticism is great, but, this one don't show very much, obviously when was made, still the political pressure was on."
4,"Hardly entertaining, but very informative","If you're a history buff and want to know all about the Watergate break in and what it led to, then you can't miss seeing this film. Director Alan Pakula does an excellent job in showing us just what Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward had to go through to uncover the truth about one of the most infamous moments in the history of the United States. There's no musical score and although Redford and Hoffman render fine acting performances, they aren't ranked among their respective best. Qualitywise, this film is about the same as the run-of-the-mill made-for-television films that pop out of the networks every once in a while. Still, it's worth a look-see if you're looking for information and not so interested in being entertained."
4,One of the best Redford films,"Well what more can you say, excellent cast and acting, very good directing,a truly classic film."
5,Great Movie,"Today i just bought the book, but already saw the movie. It was a great movie, the kind that makes you ask, why are contemporary movies so far in dialogue, in what part of the evolution did, doing a good movie meant a bad dialogue? All The Presiden't Men is the kind of movie, that we miss.. And makes you hope that the directors, and writers start going back to find the essence of what a good movie is all about!"
5,In My Opinion,"I saw this movie when it came out and it was great. As for the disc and all the extras, well, they just don't mean that much to me. I really don't care if there are extras, or if it is widescreen or standard. The movie is what matters and this is a can't miss movie."
4,All the President's Men,"For those who forgot about the Watergate era, and those who were too young or unborn, this is a recommended history lesson."
5,Ihave this on VCS tape.,I like the idea of bringing down a president that was a crook.I lived though that time in our turbulent history!
4,Political intrigue and first amendments,This movie portrays a dark time in Washington politics and deals with first amendment issues fairly. It has held up well with the passage of time but there were a few scenes that didn't work. Overall it holds the viewer's interest and I would recommend it for students of journalism.
5,History that Unfolds like a Thriller,"Whether you lived through the Watergate years or just want to know why every scandal that ever surfaces is tagged as a ""gate"", this movie will keep your attention as if it were fiction. Watch it for the pure well-pace drama that it is or watch it just to learn history. It doesn't disappoint."
1,Unfortunately A Dud,"I ordered 15 DVD's from amazon.com and this was the only one that does not work and in fact caused problems with the DVD player. So unfortunately, the quality of the particular CD I received is extremely poor. All the rest of the DVD's ordred are in excellent shape.All the President's Men (Two-Disc Special Edition)"
2,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"For over two hours blonde beach bunny Bobby Redford and his sidekick go chasing after...what? THERE'S NO PAY OFF TO WHAT GOES ON. This movie can't hold up as a story on it's own. It's very much a movie based on a real story----cause it goes nowhere! All the really important news events happened months after the plot of this movie ends!Movie ends with the blond beach bunny (who didn't even darken his hair to be truthful to dark-haired Bob Woodward) and his sidekick running---like little girls---to Jason Robards, to tell him that their life is in danger....WHEN IT'S OBVIOUS IT WASN'T, SINCE THE MOVIE ENDS RIGHT THERE, WITH EVERYBODY ALIVE AND WELL.The character of Deep Throat also comes off as fake, despite him showing up on the news decades later---it's safe to hang out in dark parking decks but not safe to talk on pay phones or some other phone..? And, for anybody born after this movie, it's never explained in the movie where the nickname Deep Throat came from!"
2,"A poor man's ""Dick""","I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film ""Dick."" ""Dick"" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).Just go rent ""Dick"" instead. You'll thank me, yourself, and those fine ladies who saved our country."
5,A classic!,This movie is a great accompaniment to PBS's recent documentary Watergate Plus: 30 Years later. We watched them back to back as PBS aired them this way as well.
5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #10,"When was the last time you were really hungry to accomplish something great? This is an outstanding movie, full of excellent actors, and it tells an amazing story. Question everything. ""When you got em by the balls - there hearts and minds will follow."""
