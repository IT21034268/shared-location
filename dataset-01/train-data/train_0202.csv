3,"MOVIE WAS GOOD, THE SOUND WAS HORRIBLE!!!","Sound Engineer Will Riley [disappointed me]! I thought something was wrong with my new DVD player, when in fact it was the horrendous lack of quality sound. I barely heard the fxxxxxx movie. It was too bad because everything about this flick was great, but my goodness the sound sucked. They pay this guy Will Riley money ? The only time the movie was heard was when there was a machine like a lawn mover or something like that going off, otherwise the only way you are going to hear anything, is by turning the volume way up!!! Oh and by the way Riley, my hearing is excellent! I think you better take some classes on basic sound engineering, I am serious dude, you need it!!!"
1,Yawn,By the end of this I was about ready to slit my wrists. This is the most boring movie I've ever seen. It started out okay but it all went downhill after the first 45 minutes. Zip chemistry between the actors and and a [weak] ending. Why did Marisa Tomei get a Best supporting actress nom? She was barely in it. Sissy Spacek did her best with the role but best actress nomination? Nope. She's a great actress but her talent was wasted here.
1,This Movie was Horrible!,"If you are looking for a mind stimulating and non-boring movie, then this is definately not the one you want to rent. There are only two boughts of action that each last for about 2 seconds. You could leave for an hour, come back to your movie, and still know what is going on! This movie was terrible. If you want a good drama I recommend renting an older movie like Fried Green Tomatoes. ""In The Bedroom"" is not worth wasting your money on!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"HORRIBLE! This is the most boring movie I've been to in years. Not only is it long (and lame) but it is completely predictable from the beginning. Many people walked out, as I should have instead of hoping for the movie to miraculously turn around."
1,Don't believe the hype; This movie is sloooow & content-free,"This movie is worse than just bad -- a small band of people seem to have hyped it up to the point that your average Joe thinks ""it can't be all that bad, it got nominated for awards"" and picks it up at the video store. Instead he gets an evening of waiting for plot to start, while fighting off sleep.Nothing much happens in this movie. The characters are shallow, the storyline is so poor that it's easy to tell what will happen next, the dialogue is bad. Maybe the acting is good, but who cares about that when you are fighting off sleep?This is the slowest paced movie I have ever watched. I suffered through it, saw through the stupid ""suprise ending"" long before it happend, and I feel ripped off by those charlatans who somehow arranged for the thing to be nominated for awards."
3,"Interesting, but I wish I could rewrite it","This is an thoughtful (though this movie rides the fine line between thoughtful and too slow) movie which messes up towards the end. A lot of time is spent introducing the characters, so when one main character dies I'm ready to follow them wherever they go. It builds up very plausibly, and about 100 minutes into it I'm sure there's going to be a great ending based on everything we've learned.Unfortunately, I feel like the movie drops the ball. It should have focused either more on the internal feelings of the characters and dropped their external actions, or it should have focused more on the after-effects of their external actions (without making it longer). As it is, the movie ending is somewhat puzzling and unsatisfying.There are absolutely no DVD extras with the movie."
4,Very Good Film,"Very good, but Spacek with a nomination? I don't think so...Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) deserved it more than anyone. It was a good film though that was quite touching at times."
3,"A great film, deserving of a better DVD release!","Todd Field's haunting, exquisite film contains two of the year's most extraordinary performances--Tom Wilkinson, who should have won the Oscar for this role, paints a heartbreaking portrait of anguish which moves him securely into the ranks of the finest actors working in films today. He is magnigicent. And he is nearly matched by Sissy Spacek's superb, understated work. This is a film which should be seen, even in this bonus-free DVD release. This DVD contains no special features, not even the film's trailer(s)! A commentary, or even a short ""making of"" featurette with the director and the actors would have been fascinating, for sure. One can only hope for a later release containing these bonuses, but why not wait to release it with a few extras?"
3,A rather languorous film that just didn't add up,"With this many reviews, the basic plot has been examined as well as the main characters. A husband and wife lose their son to a murder, and the murderer is out on bail, still running into the parents, friends and family of the victim.So, they decided (finally) to take matters into their own hands. Never mind they leave so many loose ends it's going to lead back to them in about 15 minutes, perhaps they can accept going to prison to make sure their son's killer doesn't get away with murder.I'm not buying it. Why go against everything you've stood for your whole life by giving into the same impulses? Doesn't make any sense.As for the killer, he should have known you NEVER get into a car with anyone with a gun. You run, shouting Fire!, Fire!. That's your best bet. Otherwise, the gunman controls where you go and how you end up.Interesting only for the wonderful atmospherics of the Maine location. Makes me long for another visit."
5,A BEUTIFUL MOVIE,"A story that delves deep into human relationships, In the Bedroom can basically be described as a family drama about an older couple (Wilkinson and Spacek) coming to terms with their son's (Stahl) relationship with an older woman (Tomei). But this is no bland, soap operatic drama of family fighting; the directorial debut of actor Todd Field (Eyes Wide Shut) has earned universal critical acclaim and won the coveted Audience Award at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival."
5,This was a REAL slice of life.,Acted to perfection..with outstanding direction...I have nothing but praise for this wonderful piece of film making. Bravo!
2,MORBID MORBID MORBID,"sometimes you want to love a movie. Great actors making a comeback (Sissy, Marisa). Excellent English actor (Tom), but its overtaken by a morbid and depressing plot despite the actors excellent jobs. Yes, it was realistic. Yes it was deep, but as in one scene (that felt like it lasted for hours) Sissy and Tom are just sitting and not speaking. Like i said under the circumstances i suppose it would be like that but i can't understand why anyone would praise such morbidness. I just will never understand why movies like this are made when we go to the movies for escapism (especailly at times like this). And why people would want to go see such a depressing. dull movie."
1,PLEASe don't waste your time!,"This movie aside from being extremely BORING, this movie is super depressing beyond belief. For all the extreme rave reviews, and Oscar hype, this movie dosnt live up to it's reputation in the very least! Don't waste your time nor your money, you'll regret it if you do!"
2,The Slow Life.... or the REALLY slow life,"I was excited to see this movie based on all the buzz around it. I was overwhelmingly let down. Marisa Tomei offers a great performance (for the sum total of 10 minutes she's on the screen), and Sissy Spacek is always enjoyable... but if this movie were any slower they'd be filming grass grow. It was tough to sit through and the ill-climatic ending doesn't pay back the toll the rest of the movie takes on your energy.Rent this one before you buy."
1,No Redeeming Value,"If you like slo-mo revenge fantasies, see this movie. If you are the parent of a murdered or otherwise deceased child - DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! Only the rubberneckers of therapy will ""appreciate"" the ""courage and bravery"" of this ""heroic"" couple.For a movie that describes itself ""ultimately about REDEMPTION"" [emphasis mine] in the trailer spots, where was it exactly? When he stares at the ceiling while lying ""in the bedroom"" at night? What a hero! What a saint! Bravo!Replace the ""-demption"" with ""-venge"" to get a more accurate characterization of the plot of this movie, which is only one half-step above ""I Spit On Your Grave"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in the morality category."
1,Like watching paint dry,"In the Bedroom is one of the most boring and predictable films I've seen in recent history. No suspense, no action, no reason to spend $6.50. A Hallmark Hall of Fame made for TV movie drawn out for the big screen. This type story has been told hundreds of times and in most cases in a more entertaining or thought provoking way. I stayed hoping that there would be some dramatic turn of events or twist in plot, however neither occurred. Disappointing on any level."
2,On and On and On............,"I'm a fan of most of the actors in this movie. They great actors but they cannot save this BORING script. The plot is up in the first hour, but unfortunately there is still 70 minutes of the movie to go. There's alot of blank staring into space, regression to 'bad' habits such as smoking and drinking because the characters don't know what to do with themselves. Some might say, well that's the point. They are disoriented. Well, that's fine, but not for 70 minutes. I call that BORING and it goes On and On and On and On.....To paraphase another reveiw I read: ""ZZZ...""."
2,Badly written,"Screenwriters are always saying that it is their contribution which makes the difference between a mediocre and a good movie. In this instance they are correct. The directing is fine, the acting is superb; but the screenplay is fifth-rate, full of cliches and tired old plot moves. Those who gave this movie 5 stars were obviously not watching this movie but some other movie they were imagining. This is not a tragedy but a tiresome waste of time (and only the performances of Wilkinson and Spacek will convince you otherwise)."
5,worth the buy,this lamp looks great. worth the buy fits nicely on your night stand and not very bright. great as night light when you don't want your room to be bright
2,Same as extra of theatrical edition DVD,This is on the second disc of the theatrical edition of Return of the King.
2,About as bad as you can get,"This has absolutly nothing to do with ""The Lord of the Ring"". The title was just a poor excuse to use previously filmed stuff to tie into the movie as another meathod of that great Hollywood game HYPING. I have seen some bad examples of the concept in my time but this one has got to be the worst. I mean the movie does not even mention NEW ZELAND for God's sake shouldn't a movie supposidly showcasing where the movies were filmed at least attempt to do that.Overall-Don't get suckered by the Lord of the Rings on the box, save your money."
1,Based on Jackson not Tolkien!,"Let me start by saying that I loved the movies. But this commentary uses supposed Tolkien experts that have never read the books! In the movie Aragorn is a reluctant hero. In the actual novel Aragorn has been preparing his entire life to claim, not reclaim, the throne of Gondor. That is a huge discrepancy between the movies and the novel. I am surprised that the ""experts"" did not notice."
3,Nice to revisit Aragorn's lands,"This may not be the best of the National Geographic's videos on the making of the series, but it is with fondness I recall watching them before the release of each of the movies."
2,Dvd,DVD wouldn't play all the way through. I got it at a low price. So I didn't bother returning it.
3,A departure from Betsy's low fidelity sound.,"As a fan of Bitch back from the Damnation Alley / Be my Slave days, I found the clean sound a bit surprising. They have departed from their S&M hook, but they doo have a fast nad heavy feel that really makes for graeat party music. Especially memorable is the Title track, a remake of an old Elton John tune."
3,Good album,I remember this album from my high school days. Unfortunately I only like about half the songs but I am glad that I purchased the album. This is more about nostalgia for me than anything.
4,Works Great Once You Figure Out the Audio Setup,This unit worked as described right out of the box. I just hooked up the same cables from my old VCR to get both DVD and VCR working.Only issue was that the audio while running a DVD was lower than normal TV or running a VCR tape. Subsequently I connected my stereo system/speakers as secondary output for the DVD (it's labeled on the back of the unit) and now I get great surround sound coming out of both the TV and the stereo system.It takes a bit to figure out the audio settings but once you do you'll highly enjoy this unit!!
2,Not a good consumer choice...,"I bought this set a few months ago and after a few movies watched on it, almost every DVD I had tried was skipping like heck. It wasn't my DVDs, because they were brand new, and the player was brand new, so I doubt it needed a cleaning. At first I thought I had just gotten a ""lemon"", but from the other reviewers on here, it seems like I'm not the only one. This player skips...hopefully I can get a replacement soon."
2,Works Fine ...BUT...No DVD+ formats,The unit plays store bought DVD and all VHS tapes fine-BUT-The DVD unit did NOT play my VCD's(CD-R's) or any of my DVD +R /DVD +RW dvd's.THIS IS NOT mentioned on the BOX.Until they make a unit that plays these formats --this one's goin back to the store.If it played the formats I need it to play I would rate it a 4--good price--easy hook up--easy operation --good playback.BUT...until that time it gets a 2.
5,Excellent choice,"I've had this unit almost a year now and it works perfectly. It was easy to set up, just swapped the same input and output as went into the VCR this was replacing. Sound and video quality are both good, it's easy to use and small in size. Overall, I'm very happy with my choice."
4,not to bad,"I just bought this unit a few days ago. I find it to be a prettygood piece of equipment. The picture and sound quality from theDVD is in my opinion,pretty darn good. Running it thru my stereounit I get what I feel is,theater sound quality. The picturethat it provides is really great. The VCR side of it is a bit on the short end of the stick. But overall not really that bad. The VCR sound quality isn't all that shabby for the non-connoisseur of the audio/video world.In other words, for mom dad and the kids, you'll be satisfied. The menu isn't the best but not the worst either. I was told by the sales person whom I bought the unit from, that once I get my HDTV hooked up to it, I'll be more than happy with it. Based on the comments from my circle of tecky frinds, he's right.So the bottom line is this.If your looking for a reasonable priced dual DVD/VCR unit for thefamily entertainment center, It's worth the investment.you'll be satisfied with it"
4,Good value,"The items arrived on time and in good condition. However, the mailing envelope which contained the items was torn in transit, so that when I received it, there was a gaping hole. As there was no additional packaging inside the mailing envelope, the items inside could have been damaged. Luckily, this time they were not."
2,Blurry pictures,"I take basic point and shoot pictures of my family and so on. I was really disappointed with the image and focus quality on this camera. If *anything* is moving, it tends to show up as a blur -- even a child waving his hand.The ""camera unsteady"" warning came on every time too. I even sat it on a table top, and it still warned ""camera unsteady!""I decided to return it and look for something better."
2,"If you have kids, DO NOT buy this camera","If you have kids and want to take pictures of them inside, then do NOT buy this camera. It takes great pictures outdoors. Indoors, most of my pictures of my kids are blurry. I have to take five or more pictures to get one that comes out ok. If your kids are moving while you're trying to take their picture, forget it, they won't come out. I do use this camera for outdoor pictures, but inside I use my Sony CyberShot DSC-P8, it's older, but still takes great indoor pictures."
2,It was good in its short life,"The camera was an excellent one, it took very high-quality pictures; however, it broke a little more than a year after I bought it, it wouldn't power on for an unknown reason, and it was exactly 14 days out of the one-year warranty! The repair cost is rather expensive: $184. I would rather buy a new one than to send it for repair."
1,this was recalled in japan and china,"there are bad reviews all over the internet about this camera. there are multiple problems, one being a circuit board that goes bad and causes the camera to cease operating -- lens retraction and opening problems (constant power off/ power on messages). just search online for the model number and ""problem"" or ""lens"" and you'll see what i mean.this camera was one of 6 sony models that were recalled in china and japan back in 2005 when they came out.BUT SONY NEVER DID A NORTH AMERICAN RECALL!!!what a rip off!!!!"
2,Blurry Photos,the camera is very sensitive to movement and seems to snap blurry photos. When the button is pushed the camera has a delay reaction to the shot and does not respond immediately. I am having to retake many photos because of inaccurate and blurred pics. Have developed many photos that are not clear. I am sorry I spent so much money and did not get quality. I am disappointed in Sony since I have many other products from them that are worth the expense. I am thinking of buying another brand that is more reliable.Enrica Funari
1,It will break. Sony will not honor warranty.,"This fragile little camera is not built to last.After 9 months of light use, the plastic latches on the interior of the battery compartment door broke. Sony refused to honor warranty and wanted $175 to fix it. This problem is so common that ebay has auctions for kits to fix the problem at about $40, but the repair is fairly complex to do at home.The camera is not robust enough even for moderate use. Sony customer service is a joke."
1,if I could give 0 I would,sony camera's are the worst to repair. they charge you $200.00 for a flash. That is almost the same price as a new one. Buy the other brands. they have local shops that will fix warrenty problems SONY does NOT have this. you have to send it to Texas. I don't even live in a state that touchs Texas. Please Buy a different brand of camrea you will be much happier. the parts and acc. are more as well.
2,"Bad focus in low-light, now it doesn't work","I've owned this camera a little over a year. It was my 2nd digital camera. It always had focus issues in low-light. I thought it was me, but after working extensively with the manual, after I finally had some time, I discovered that it was the camera. You really need a tripod for those low-light shots. I wasn't able to return it, so I've taken hundreds of pictures with it. It takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen. However, the lens will no longer contract and I get an error message that is unresolvable unless I pay at least $170. I'm just going to get a better quality camera. I will not buy Sony again."
2,This camera won't last!,"I agree with most of the other negative reviews here- focus problems!! My camera lens is now stuck, and the camera is completely inoperable. It is about 2 years old, so I did get some good use out of it, but I am upgrading. Different brand this time!!"
3,"Nice Pix, Crappy Reliability","I bought this camera when I was in Japan in October 2004 and immediately fell in love with it despite its rather short lifespan. Like April Sumner's experience in the review prior to mine, I too received the infamous ""error message"" with a non-retractable lens. Now I, like her, am stuck with a camera that's not worth fixing. It took some great pix, but also did poorly with a flash as people were washed out when it was used. I did like the versatility of being able to use both regular (Li-technology) and rechargeable batteries. I am not sure ifI would buy another Sony product again."
3,good for its price,the picture quality is great. it's good value for money. serves the purpose of taking pictures at everyday occasions. small and easy to carry
4,The stage is set...,"...for part two. The world of words is torn apart and we are given opportunities to gasp in horror and laugh in surprised amusement. Violation of expectation, indeed. The world is at once a comfortable and sadistic junction for every emotion that flows from our souls. The soundtrack to our fears and retributions mashes the hair-raising and the sublime into one cruel, beautiful mess. For lovers of jazz and car crashes."
1,Simply terrible,Instructions were unclear at times. Videographer often focused on close up shots of feet which made it more difficult to follow. There are better latin workouts on the market. Crunch has one with the same instructor that is better.
3,JUST OK,"First I must state that this is the first dance dvd I'm doing. The steps were difficult at first and she doesn't really instruct, but after a few runs I was able to get the steps down. It does make you sweat and when you get the moves it's fun for a while then I needed to move on to something less annoying. The instructor is okay at best, the music is terrible, and forget about the videography. When I was trying to follow the steps the camera would shift from showing their feet to all of a sudden showing their faces. So basically I was able to get the steps down only by rewinding over and over to the few moments they showed their feet and the actual steps."
2,I didn't like it.,It was hard to follow and I didn't understand the move.She was just keep dancing and did not explain about the move. It was very unclear.This DVD did not help me at all.
2,This is Latin dance?,"I had hoped this would provide some fun aerobic exercise to the sort of Latin music that makes you want to move, with the leader showing me some Latin dance moves (tango, cha cha, etc.). I didn't recognize any of the moves - or music - from watching ballroom-variety Latin dance on TV. That would have been a disappointment but not a total loss - if I were able to follow the leader in whatever it was she was doing to whatever music. I wasn't. Why does no one ever place the camera behind the leader once in awhile so that the viewer can copy the moves without having to mirror-image them first? I gave up on this video and went back to my old Gilad videos. No music, but at least he gives you a chance to learn the moves."
3,Annoying video,"I really like to dance and I'm not that bad at it either. The moves in this video are fun, although the instructor is rather annoying. She basically talks to much. That said, it does get your heartrate going a little. It's good for intermediate dancers if you can stand the instructor. One interesting thing about the video is the gender-bending back-up dancer."
2,Can't see her feet,"Glad I rented this first before buying. She does introduce the steps little by little, but between the horrible camera angles and those whispy pants she wears, it is very difficult to actually see what her feet are doing. She'll say ""watch my feet"" but the cameraman zooms in too much and its hard to get the whole picture - the bottom of her pants are very long and whispy and cover most of her feet - you only see material swishing around.... I got frustrated not being able to see how she was moving - I spent most of my time yelling at the non-existant camera man to pull back! The music was good and her instructions were good (although sometimes too quick) but for me it isn't worth buying and trying to figure out."
3,Not the greatest DVD,"This is a British program focusing on British model railways, mostly in OO and N scale. Some parts are quite interesting but overall I wasn't too impressed - and I'm a big fan of British model railways! The pace is very slow and it tends to drag, I found myself using the fast forward button quite often. Worth avoiding."
4,Very Cool Stuff,"This is filled with great photos of some of the most amazing baseball memorabilia that you'll ever seen. The book can be really, really expensive, so try to find it used.Andy."
1,Lots of anecdotes and insights but little theory & practice,"This book is in the tradition of Edgar Cayce. The authors are trying to describe a type of therapy, but it gets lost among the many personal anecdotes that dominate this book. Because of this, I got very little out of this book."
5,crisis is a must own for fans of good music,"i am not sure what to classify this album as. For those who may not know crisis, karyn crisis is the singer and she can both sing and scream which she does plenty of both for this record. the music is in the death/black metal vein. i think her voice is so beautiful when she sings in that low almost whisper like tone yet she is very powerful when she screams. the music is super heavy and dark. guitars are tuned low which i especially like. the music pushes and pulls you, is fast and furious yet sometimes subtle and atmospheric in a somber metal way that i adore. my favorites are track 2, in the shadow of the sun and track 5, kingodoms end. buy this album now!!!like dust and we fall and we fall and we fall"
5,Karyn Crisis still rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you read my review of ""deathshead"" you know how I feel about this band. The Hallowing is a departure. It is as good, but more introspective, more poetic, and check out the artwork. Ms. Crisis does all of the artwork on this and all other Crisis releases. She is the goddess of extreme music. Her talent is in her raw courage. I love Karyn Crisis.""Lost Johnny"""
4,Bannockburn 1314,"I thought this book on the Battle of Bannockburn was very good. It was concise and had an excellent intoduction to the battle itself. The pictures, graphics, and illustrations were excellent. One fault I found was not enough time was spent on The Good Sir James of Douglas and his pursuit of a defeated enemy. This pursuit with an inferior force was one of the greatest I feel in military history and not enough was written about it."
2,Obnoxious,"I have practiced yoga for a couple of years and experienced different styles of teaching. The challenge of this CD was decent, but I just couldn't stand his annoying voice and comments. Throughout the routine, he would sigh loudly, which distracted me from the poses. His voice and choice of words are very abrasive. I did not enjoy it at all and sent it back for a refund."
2,Parental caution,"Like others I have to say the work-out is challenging and well thought out BUT I doubt I will ever listen to it again. I started this with my college age son who is college on a sports scholarship. He and I both were thinking power yoga would be a good boost in his routine, Bryan Kest was a poor choice to introduce my children to my favorite type of exercise. My 9 year old left the room in the first 30 min because ""this guy has a dirty mouth mom"". My teen girls won't ever do this routine with me again because they were not only annoyed and offended by Bryan Kests slang and sexual connotations the lack of Yoga music and annoying noises in the back ground never allowed for them to find a meditative place. VERY VERY disappointed. If it was not for the excellent book of poses I would not hesitate to send it back, may still do that. Vulgar language and street slang have no place in my yoga meditation."
2,audio CD,Not for the beginner. this is a boot leg AUDIO cd that comes with a book on poses. If you're not familiar with Bryan Kent yoga then you wont kee up.
3,ps2 version does not live up to the expectation,"Im going to start off with this fact, you Do NOT geta nuke in the ps2 version to use antime. You only get to se it on the last mission. You do not get custom vehicals nor a moderscycle. you dont get pistols and all the weopons arwe the same as the first mercs. It is a very short game. It will take you only two days to beat it. The improve ments are, there are some better vehicals, a bigger map, and the storyline is a lot less bland. ion the end It is a fun game but if you want to get the real mecinaries 2 World in Flames experience you will want to get it for the xbox360 or the playstation 3"
3,It was an ok game,"Well Mercenaries 2 was an ok game. I bought it new for the ps2. I like the game because it is somewhat simple and not very challenging. The last mission where you have to nuke Solano's big doors was the most difficult but even that wasn't too bad. Just be sure you can take off in a helicopter right after you laser beam the doors so you don't die from the nuke. I did not like the fact that you could not kill the civilians, what's up with that? The graphics could use some improvement: The civilian cars are lame, when you crash them not much damage is done to the vehicle. You know what also bothered me quit a bit was when life was taken from you for just falling a bit from a cliff or high jump, that was dumb. Overall it was ok. ""Focus your fire on Matias!"""
2,Not That Great,"This game is not as good as the Xbox 360 or PS3 editions. The graphics, weapons , and vehicles are the exact same thing as the original, with different names. The graphics are the same quality as the original, but the game is not half as fun or challenging as the first. A sub-par game on this system."
3,MERCENARIES 2,"ABOUT THE SAME AS THE FIRST ONE BUT NOT QUITE AS GOOD, I THINK.IT SEEMS TO BE SLOWER AND GRAPHICS ARE NOT AS GOOD.COULD HAVE HAD A FEW MORE MISSIONS TO COMPLETE ALSO"
1,Game with incorrect language,We have bought this game for my son and were a present for Christmas; but when received we did not see that it was in french language.When my son opened the game and try to play with it he said daddy this game is in french and do not understand northing of they're saying. I do not understand how this game is sold in US and shipped from NY has come with foreign language.
2,Mediocre,"This game is OK.It has its good points but is loaded with flaws.You are a Mercenary paid to destroy and kill.Choose between 3 people; Chris Jacobs, Jennifer Mui, and Mattias Nielson.Pros:Same controls as mercs 1swimmingboatstropical environmentnew vehiclesCONS:Can't kill civilians and you lose money when you hit or shoot themboring storyboring mission structuresame weapons as mercs 1driving mechanis have decreasedtargeting hasn't improvedflying is hardcan't destroy everything like in mercs 1All in all this game gets 5/10 cause it still is Mercenaries. Just so,so lazy."
2,not much fun,"Not as good as the first game. To much confusion going on. You go here and there, butyou do not seem to accomplish much."
3,Viva La Revolution!!!,The reason i rated this game only 3 stars is because its just not as fun as the 1st one. On the first one it just had more epicness. If you want to know about #1. Check out my review for mercenarys: playground of destrotion for ps2. Its awesome.
4,Excellent game!!!,"I really liked this game, I was also impressed on how fast it shipped to my house. The gameplay was very creative, I found it a little short and I was I was disapointed that you can't play online. Other than that I love to blow stuff up and hijack all kinds of vehicles including copters, boats and tanks. There was also a great selection of guns. It also has that hint of humor that everyone likes. I like to think of it as a Grand Theft Auto in a warzone."
5,Church Leadership Must Have!,"I bought this copy for a friend who is going into a new ministry role. I heard about this book at a conference where Craig was speaking and read it myself. Instructions on how to have a Christ centred, faith filled, focused and influential church. Great read!"
2,'IT' is about popularity,"Craig Groeschel makes some good points about how people can impact the world for the sake of the cross, but in the end his church is about numbers of attendees, popularity, power, and gloss. Unsurprisingly, Groeschel never takes into account that Jesus was none of these things. Groeschel rejects the humble anti-establishment wealth-denouncing rabbi for the popular smiling television star with a headset."
5,READ IT,"I want IT, I need IT, now I know how to get IT. I read IT from cover to cover without stopping. I will have my team read IT, and do a book study on IT. IT is a must for every leader."
5,Great book...,This book simply challenges you to look at what we do as churches and why...I shared 'it' with my congregation as we looked ahead at what God might have planned for us in our city.
3,'it' is Great,"At first 'It' comes off as a 'trying to be way to cute' read, but, once one gets past the 7 million uses of 'it' per page, the author has great insite into the culture we live in & how to not fall into the trap of thinking that the presence of God comes from programs. I have enjoyed & been challenged by the book."
3,It - thin on style,"I found the writing style to be rather juvenile, though the author has some valid points. If he hopes to reach an audience outside the mainstream churches of the USA, he's going to have to write in a more scholarly fashion in the future.References to contemporary personalities are wasted - how many of us in ministry have time to watch endless movies or TV series?"
5,Wonderful book!,This book is a great resource and should be a must read for all pastors. I would encourage the pastoral staff to read it together and go through the study questions. It can really challenge the team to go to the next level!
5,How Churches and Leaders CAn get IT and Keep It.,I have not finished this book yet ... but it is well written with great humor as well as being very informative!The discussion questions after each chapter have been very useful for our group discussions.I would recommend it highly!
5,Exceptional!,"I recommend this book to anyone who is on the spiritual journey. Whether you are a seasoned veteran of the faith or a person who is really investigating the claims of Christianity - this would be a valuable resource to add to your book collection!I am particularly impressed by the idea that failure is a necessary step to achieving success. It can be so tempting to expect perfection out of ourselves right away. But that just isn't the way you really learn and grow! There are tons of uplifting and inspiring quotes that have been offered by well-known people.I do love the way the author ends the book with three prayers that he prays over himself - and ultimately over you: That you would be stretched, ruined, and healed. How powerful of a notion to enter into a person's prayer life. Please read this book, it comes with my highest recommendation!"
2,I don't know what YOU guys are seeing...,"What a waste of time... this movie was a nothing but a mixed-up nebulus of cheesy dialogue, cliche' characters, and a ending with utterly no logic. I mean, if your going to write a movie about another time and place, you can't just chuck someone into the middle of it and expect the viewer to know as much about the characters as the writer does. They don't tell you jack, and if it was simply a case of giving you a minor amount of information to make it engaging, then fine. But with this, all you get is bits and pieces of loose-ended ideas and characters that I KNOW that I've seen before. Finally, the last thing I must rant is that of all the names to call this vampire hunter D impersonator... why did they call him Darkside? I mean... you can't get any less origonal than that, but I guess that's the situation with this whole movie."
1,terrible shipping,I ordered darkside blues and it never came.i didn't even get my money back.Watch out for the super savings shipping.
4,Hey pretty good,"For the firsat part, this movie was pretty good (hence the title). Sure there were random popups of characters but who cares, they die anyways (some in a totally cool battle scene) and also let me point out how much the female leader in the movie looks like releena from the gundam wing series (people whove watched it you kno wht i'm talking about*) For a movie that was made in 1994 the animation was pretty good but I have to say I wasnt to fond of the music even though it had a good honest beat but seriously I think it would have been used elswhere (the wrong scenes with the wrong music) but cheers to the old drunken guy who starts singing that just cracked me up. Another thing I want to point out is, did you ever notice how the guy who made this movie and lets say Ninja Scoll (yes i kno im comparing it with tht movie) always has a string of bad guys, meh thts just me but w/e. All in all I thought this movie was pretty good, the ending was fasinationg...sequal anyone?"
1,"If you liked Demon City Shinjuku, Vampire Hunter D, or Wicked City...","You'll hate this.Avoid this like the plague.This movie begins in the middle and ends in the middle, none of your questions will be answered, EVERYTHING is left up to interpretation, and the director/creator fails miserably at attempting to spark interest by revealing absolutely NOTHING and maintaining secrecy throughout the entire (if you must call it) ""FILM""."
4,An intriguing anime with a memorable character,"This anime remains apart from most in so much as it has an adult plot that combines the best elements of storytelling with brutal violence. The story is set in a Bladerunner environment with one Mega-corporation owning most of Japan. There are small areas of rebellion known as the Darkside of Tokyo. Far more interesting than this typical plot is the arrival of a possibly supernatural stranger. To reveal more would spoil a well crafted plot. The animation is exellent, the music suits the pace of the movie. The dubbing is also good, and the overall quality of the anime is very high. A manga recommended for fans of wicked city, vampire hunter 'D' or any horror anime. Thus it makes an exellent purchase."
2,people should not compare these guys to cradle of filth,"This album is just terrible. The keyboards suck, the vocals are horrible, and the guitars are just lame.Drums in black metal have to be powerful, and this has to be some of the worst drumming i've ever heard. I mostly judge on the keyboards, and i have to say that if you wanna get good black metal keys, look somewhere else. Christfire is actually a good song, very melodic and pretty well written, but everything else is just down the drain. Listen to Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, or Twilight Ophera if you want good black metal."
4,"Worth buying, when you have cash to burn","This album in my opinion was good. Although the vocalist sounds like Dani Filth, from Cradle Of Filth, his voice is in no way are clear or crisp as Dani's. Other than that the album was worth a listen to. The keyboards were nicely done as well as the guitar, the drumming could have been better however."
4,Soooo underrated.,"No, this isn't the latest da Vinci code. But it isn't half as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. Yes, this is a very philosophical novel. It was written a couple of centuries ago and thus reflects the conditions of the time. Yet it capture in universal terms the uncertainties faced by an adolescent as he takes his place in society. This is the reason it was taken as a template for such novels over a period of a hundred years in Germany. For contemporary literature treating the same topic there are obviously better alternative, but for an understanding of how individuality shaped the modern world, this is an excellent place to being your investigations."
5,"Turn it up, way up...","Probably their heaviest album, also one of heir best. I wore out my first copy.If you like SNFU, do yourself a favor and find the Wheat Chiefs (SNFU without Chi Pig) - you won't be disappointed."
4,Fat guys know how to make great grills!,"The George Forman Grill is life changing. This is the most usefull item in my kitchen. My only concern is the non stick surface is aready starting to wear off, and I only wash the plate by hand with a sponge (no scrubbing)."
2,"Piece of Junk, No Quality Here","I bought this grill because of the different plates you can put on. It saves on appliance space in our pantry.GOOD:It cooks waffles, burgers good.BAD:The teflon on the plates was coming off after the first hand washing. We cooked burgers and scrubbing with a sponge made the teflon wear off.The plates can be hard to get on and don't fit very securely, attached but loose.$100 is too much for this item the quality is very poor."
1,VERY HARD TO CLEAN TOP GRILL,"very hard to clean top steak plate. suprised they didn't realize that. Stick to the regular foreman grills, if your looking for easy cleaning.Also, thing smells a lot like plastic when you bring it to high heat with the lid closed to warm it up.Also, it tends to cook things real dry.I think the traditional foreman grills are the best. stick to that."
4,I love cooking with George,"The G5 does what you would expect: Grill up burgers and steak without an outdoor grill. However, the removable plates are a really nice feature. After a few times using the waffle plates, I have figured out the exact amount of batter to pour into each side. I have also used it to grill paninis and make eggs.The temperature is adjustable rather than just three settings, which is nice. The only thing I can really complain about is that the plates don't seem the most secure when they are snapped onto the grill. They just seem a little wobbly, though they still work fine."
3,Worried that I bought a used grill!!!!!!!!!,"I chose the one Star so I could write something about this product. It looked as though it had been used alredy and I bought a new product. I did not know this until my daughter-in-law informed me she found grease on one of the plates as she was getting ready to use the grill. I came back to check to make sure I had ordered a new grill. I would not have ordered a used one at all. As a matter of fact she had already used one of the other grill inserts to fix something on the grill. So, now I am wondering if we have used this grill after someone else had already used it."
2,Broken screw,"In my experience the grill works fine. I cooked meat, fish and vegetables. However after less than one month the right screw that allows the upper plate to be opened and closed broke. From inspection it seems that this is an assembly problem (the screws on the two sides look different for no clear reason). I loved the way it cooked but it didn't last long. I hope I can get it substituted."
2,I would not recommend it.,"First I have to say this unit could be dangerous! I am contacting GF to let them know that they have units being shipped with exposed chrome handles that have VERY sharp edges that can cut skin if you run a finger along the edge.After reading all of the reviews I expected great things from this grill but have been very disappointed. First I had to use a infrared temperature sensor to get an approximate idea of what the different settings (1,2,3) correlated to and discovered the plate temperature fluctuates greatly when the unit reaches the desired setting. This temperature fluctuation makes it difficult to predict what kind of cooking time you need. If you are making a panini frequent checking is required. I just cooked some salmon on it and even preheated to the highest setting it had virtually no sear/char.I just ordered the Breville Smart Grill and hope it will pick up where these ""cheap"" grills leave off."
3,It's tiny!,"What? Just got it and it's so tiny! Why would they make it look so big? I doubt we can even fit two sirloin steaks in there--as for waffles, who eats just one waffle? I'm sad cuz otherwise it's pretty cool...:-("
3,Foreman Grille,"Have not used product yet, recently uncrated everything and it does not seem to be too sturdy - it has interchangeable plates that are not the easiest to use - to insert or to take out - I have a regular Foreman Grille and like it very much - this is larger and has a lot of options. I am sure it will be fine when using it - don't understand the different configurations of plates yet though -there are 2 waffle plates and the other 3 are assorted - flat grille and raised grilles."
3,Read the reviews first!,"This grill shut off when it reached a certain temperature. Unfortunately, it stayed off so long that I thought it was broken. I went back and read the reviews and found that another person reported the same issue so I guess it is a product defect. I returned it to Amazon because I did not like the length of time the grill stayed off."
5,My Kitchen Buddy,"Amazing device! I have had the GRP4P for a year now, after daily scrubbings the coating at the edges has worn off a bit, still works great though. Got the G5 from Target yesterday with the Omlette/Snack plate included. Pancakes away!"
4,Foreman Grill works for us!,"We were looking ofr something to grill fish and burgers and this George Foreman Grill does the job. We haven't used the other features of the removeable grill plates but anticipate they will work as well as the primary grilling plates.My husband was impressed that the plates removed so easily and cleaned up in a snap. This replaced a much smaller, off brand grill that was difficult to clean and couldn't cook more than 2 burgers at a time.We're very happy with our grill and would highly recommend it anyone who enjoys grilling on the kitchen counter!"
4,YEAH!,"Wanted this for so long, loved my orginal one, but wanted bigger with removal plates and I love it, only real drawback is more bulky and more stuff to store than all inclusive unit, but well worth it at any price for fast cooking on a busy schedule with kids."
1,TOXIC,"I ordered one it smoked and smelled so bad even after washing multiple times and heating up and cooling down multiple times. I liked the design and functionality of it so I called Salton and got good service and they sent me a replacement. The replacement did not smoke this time but the toxic fumes where so strong I had to have the doors and windows open with the vent fan on high. I washed the plates multiple times and again heated it and let it cool multiple times and the fumes never went away. If you can see, smell, or taste chemicals then it is way to toxic for food preparation. Made in China with some dangerous stuff. Thank you to Amazon for taking this toxic thing back."
3,Disappearing Non-stick Coating,"This is my second GF grill. I had a different model for over a year. The GRP90WGR suffers from the same problem as the first one I owned. The non-stick coating is really poor. It doesn't last very long, even with careful cleaning. My new grill has been used under ten times and the coating is disappearing from high spots in the grill surface even though I only use a soft sponge to clean it. In all other respects, this is a well-designed appliance."
1,Nonstick coating comes of after several months,"After several months of light use, nonstick coating came off the removable plates. We took great care cleaning the plates, strictly adhering to the guides described in the product manual, but this happened anyway. Here is the worst part: even though our purchase was still under warranty, Salton was not willing to send us any replacement plates. They said they are out of stock two months ago, and are still ""out of stock"" as of last week, God knows if they will ever have these plates again. A terrible experience, will never buy from them again."
2,Fragile coating,"Cooks very well, but coating was almost all gone after onlya few uses. Cleaned only with paper towel and supplied sponge per instructions, but coating went away."
1,They don't make replacement plates,"This GF grill performs well and but for the following I would have given it more stars. The non-stick coating peels off within a year and for some strange reason the people over at George Foreman do not make replacement grill plates. Now with all the concern for the environment, why would I need to dispose of a working product just because I need teflon back on one of my grill plates? But yet I can't buy just the grill plate from the GF people even though this unit still performs? What a waste and unneccesary expense. George Foreman, get with the times. Save the planet's resources and our pockets and help us replace your faulty non-stick grill plates buy selling us just the grill plates when our grills are still working. Until then I will NOT buy my FOURTH, yes my 4th!, GF grill (which the electronics still work in them) - just so I will have fresh non-stick coatings instead of peeling Teflon coming off into my food."
5,"Outstanding concept, the best George yet.","I have 5 George's including the G5. They are all excellent. When the removable plates came out, I bought one immediately, with terric results. These different plates are great. The leveler knob is a great idea, especially for runny things like eggs or batters. Only thing I wish it had was a digital temp control instead of a know, which takes some getting used to your cooking style.I've bought 3 more for gifts. Perfect for new cooks or newlyweds."
1,Save your money,Save your money on this one. I ordered this model to replace a GPR99 (the jumbo model w/digital).When the unit arrived I was very disapointed with the build quality. It didn't come close to my former model. It was very light weight and cheesy looking. Not sure why they exagerated the long handle; surely that will break. The unit also had a dent in the lid and the surface appeared greasy.(used?)The grill surface is not big enough for two steaks at a time. I returned it to Amazon without a problem and bought another jumbo model locally.
2,Next Generation Grill,"I found it to be disappointing in the griddle feature. The pancakes would not brown. It wouldn't get hot enough to fry an egg. For Panini, it only has one plate so the grill marks don't match.It just doesn't get hot enough for true grilling."
4,GF Grill,Love it for the most part. Great fish. Sits slightly uneven so things in the baking tray pool to the left.
5,Great Product,"I ordered this because it seemed like it had such versatility and I am not a fan of frying things on the stove and the mess that causes. I have not been disappointed. The grill function alone is worth the price. So far I've cooked chicken breasts, chops, and burgers and all have been juicy and tender. I also have made grilled sandwiches that were so easy and delicious. Finally, the waffle plates are an added bonus that have made good waffles. Getting the right amount of batter on the plates takes a little experience, but even when I first used too little they were still presentable. After all this is said, I have only had the George Foreman grill for a couple of weeks! I use a little oil sprayed on for ease of cleanup and then wipe and rinse the plates and put them in the dishwasher. Cleanup is so easy."
2,2 stars only,1. waffle plates do not produce waffles like a regulat waffle iron2. buiscut or bun plates are the same as waffle plates we do not recomend them.
4,I'm a fan!,This is my second GF Grill. I love it! I especially appreciate being able to put the plates in the dishwasher. I love being able to set the temperature on this one. I've cooked chicken and tenderloin on it so far. Everything has cooked exceptionally well. I'm a fan!
4,George's Super Grill,This grill was purchased for my daughter for Christmas. They flip houses and spend the weekends at that location. So this grill is perfect for them as they can use just one appliance for many uses. From what she has told me she likes it a lot.
4,PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA,"George with the removable plates is the BEST - Custom pizza in minutes is my favorite. The removable plates make cleaning a snap. Waffles are wonderful, pancakes superb. The plates fit a bit loose so when raising the lid don't jostle them. I just ordered the omelet plate and will look forward to cooking a breakfast favorite. The booklet's suggested cooking times aren't that accurate, so be ready to experiment to find the right times for your G-meals. Being able to control temps. with low/medium/high is a great addition to the George."
2,not even,"I've had this grill for a few years now. I like that the plates can be removed and put into the dishwasher. My biggest complaint is the fact that it is not even...the top plate on mine measures 100 degrees (F) hotter than the bottom one. So I basically have to keep flipping my burgers or one side will be burned and the other side not cooked enough. Also when I open the lid it basically stops cooking since the bottom plate isn't as hot. I'm not a big fan of the long drip pan either... I had a different brand before where it sent everything into one corner and into a little cup... that was easier to carry and dump than this long, shallow pan. Also I had no luck using this for pancakes..half sticks to the top, and half sticks to the bottom."
2,Non-Stick doesn't last.,Loved the removable plates ... cleanup was easier but the non-stick came off after a couple of months in a few places. Very disappointed. Had another really cheap brand and the non-stick didn't give us any problems at all for a couple of years in a few places. We used it for five years. I thought George's name wld last at least as long. We had the year replacement or refund from wal-wart and returned the item. Don't know if I'll ever try George Foreman brand again.
5,Happy Grilling,"This George Foreman grill has made it easier to enjoy fat free items. My husband had a heart attack and we have to eat a lot of chicken and fish right now. His biggest complaint is ""DRY"" chicken. With the George Foreman, we use a little healthy marinade and he's happy with how juicy it is. We also use it a lot for wholegrain sandwiches without needing the extra fat added.It saves me a huge amount of time because it cooks in half the time. We just love it. Our friends had one and we enjoyed the ease with which she cooked, so we had to have one."
2,Disappointed!,I ordered this grill for my parents. The only attachment they use now is the grill. The others have never worked as well. The biggest disappointment is the waffle baker. The temperature doesn't get hot enough. The non stick coating is wearing thin really fast.
5,The newest and best George Foreman grill,"The grill plates fit very well, the heating elements provid even heat for all the grill plates. I found that it makes perfect waffles. And the Grill plate makes perfect grilled cheese sandwiches. And as always grilled meats come out perfect and fast."
5,Made to last.,"I was going through the list of past purchases on amazon, and saw this grill. Since I absolutely LOVE it, I decided to write a quick review on it's quality. I bought this grill back in Nov 2007, and it still works as good as the day a received it. The plates are also still in great shape, and that's with my putting them in the dishwasher. So if you are intimidated by the $100 price tag (which I was), just know it's still going after 4yrs and counting."
1,George Foreman grill,"I have a couple of older smaller George Foreman grills that I really like, but this one is very disappointing. I should have returned it. It does not get hot enough to cook waffles, which is what I was specifically looking for, and it is slow on meat as well - doesn't brown it. Probably a defective unit."
1,disapointment I belived other people's rateing.,"I purchased the grill December 11 2009 The nonstick surface no longer works on the grill , so clean up is very difficult. Today's date is May 19 2010 this sucks because I purchased this grill based on customers reviews. 5 months use is terrible performance. I had a Foreman grill that some one gave me and it the surface worked grate for one year and six months. The grill did not have removable plates and was in the $39 price range. I was looking forward to long term usefulness from this grill I purchased all the extra plates available. The quality control for this product is sourly lacking or the consumer reviews are exaggerated. I know that nonstick coatings vary greatly based on the process used. Clearly the coating on the Gorge Foreman grill is inferior and not a premium coating. Premium nonstick coatings last for many years with out fail."
2,No ability to purchase replacement plates.,"This grill works but after a year of usage, the plates are very difficult to clean (loss of non-stick ability). Looking back, I wish I would have purchased the warranty service because without the plates, its worthless. I only use the grill plates and its getting more and more difficult to clean them. I attempted to purchase a replacement but Foreman doesnt offer them. A good way to keep the profits flowing in, I guess. When it comes time, Im going to purchase a non-Foreman grill out of principle."
1,Dangerous defect,"As noted by other buyers, all the plates are loosely held. As a matter of fact, one of the plate didn't even hold and my first try at grilling fell onto the floor as I was using the side handle to maneuver the machine. I have spoken with customer support and reported this incident. They also realize other customer reported this same issue. They are sending out a replacement order. I will wait and see if this also has the same defect.Just received replacement item today and still has the same defect. Also spoke with customer support and they are saying customers have also called in reporting the same problem. Why would anyone knowingly sell a defective product that posses a serious hazard? I see a lawsuit in the making if anyone gets hurt.Will be returning defective item."
5,Foreman Next Generation,"This is a terrific grill. I love the fact that all the plates are not only removeable, but dishwasher safe also. It sure beats trying to remove the grease and pieces of meat that stuck to my original Foreman. I'd recommend this to every one. Only drawback is that it is a little smaller, but you can get around that issue."
3,Just ok,This grill is ok and so far I like it. I gave 3 stars because it cools down while cooking and takes to long to rewarm up. I made waffles in it and I did not come out crispy enough. I like because you can change plates and easy to clean. I am not going to send it back because I have not cook other products in it.
1,Big let down,"Have owned George Foreman GRP90 for over a year and am now replacing it because the finish on the plates has eroded. Followed manufacturer's directions for cleaning. When I put the plates in the dishwasher they came out rusty -- a first with any metal object I put in the dishwasher, much less one with supposedly nonstick finish. The nonstick finish, in fact, was never non stick. I will say that it did the cooking job, but the difficulty in cleaning it made it a frustrating experience. Now, with the finish gone, It cannot be cleaned well enough to use. Another problem: Unlike other grillers, it doesn't have a drip pan. There is a little hole in the bottom where grease drips out, even after you've cleaned the plates and wiped the whole exterior with paper towels, the grease continues to ooze out of the bottom. Yuk!"
4,LOVE IT!,"I absolutely love this grill. The removable, dishwasher safe plates is exactly what I was looking for. I had a first generation grill but the plates were not removable. Let's just say that it went swimming a couple times in the sink. Anyway, I bought this G5 model for some friends of mine last year and they love it. I decided after hearing their reviews that I would get one for myself. It's the best ever. I highly recommend it."
5,George Foreman Next Generation Grill,"This grill works well, makes good waffles, burgers, etc. I have not tried ""baking"" with it yet but it meets my expectations. It could use a little longer power cord."
3,Just OK,"Products does not heat properly, have to place items in middle, near theback to get them cooked properly....If you place things correctly it does a nice job,, the waffles forget it, just a big mess.. Very hard to cleanthe outside and the back where it is connected to the wiring. The platesclean up wonderful in the dishwasher or by hand.."
3,"try to locate new plates ,next to impossible","i have owned this little grill for a couple of years now, cooks all meats quickly , but just try to find a replacement plate for it, the non stick coating doesnt last very long , and after it comes off , all of your meats will stick to the plates and then cleanup is a nightmare. i have looked online for replacement plates and have had no luck as of yet , im guessing that the replacement place will be so costly that it will cost as much as the grill. if so , ill trash the grill i have now and be done with all george foreman products. since my plates are basically useless, i bought a new wave oven from amazon , this thing rocks!!! it has totally replaced my GF grill. do a search on the new wave oven , it blows the GF grill away ,spend the extra money and get the extender ring , its well worth it!!!"
5,Great Gift,"I bought this as a gift and they loved it, I mean for the price you can't do better.....this is double in department stores."
4,Multi-tasking grill,"This grill was a Valentine's Day present for my husband. He has done steaks, fish, and waffles, among other things, and it has worked well for each. The removable grilling plates are much easier to clean than our old original Foreman. The new grill is bigger and so takes up more storage space, but it is worth it."
4,Great versatility!,"Only thing I am diasppointed in is that there is no smooth, or flat upper exchangable plate. This would allow better grilling of items like sandwiches, ie, a grilled cheese. I only did this once, since it compressed the sandwich the respective depth of the grilling grids."
2,5 plates for 2 possibilities,"Looks great. Love the handle that can be used without getting burned. But, for a 5-plate interchangeable thing, there aren't really 5 things you can do with it. Yes, you can make waffles. And, you can cook a steak and chicken. But, if you try a panini, it not only looks really weird given the top (god-awful-to-clean) plate, it doesn't melt and cook equally all the way through. So, if you need something to get rid of fat when you do hamburgers or steak, go for it (or a way less expensive version that takes up less space). If you want it to be a multi-purpose griller to make breakfast, lunch and dinner, look elsewhere."
2,COOKS WELL... BUT PROBLEMS,"CHICKEN, PORK CHOPS, HAMBURGS all great - be careful to not overcook as it's easy to dry meats out. HOWEVER, I've had trouble adjusting the tilt lever. It won't stay in place & seems ""locked"" in the tilt mode. Also, after 5 uses the red light power indicator doesn't work so I'll send it back. Two strikes and your out!"
4,Griill,We have really enjoyed the grill...... Probably not ideal for more than two people however....
1,Coating is peeling off!,"Very disappointed with this George Foreman grill. The paint is actually peeling off on all of the plates I am using with it. This is despite it being ""dishwasher safe"". I called their warranty department 3 months ago for replacement plates and I STILL haven't seen them delivered. Last time I called, they claimed they were on ""backorder."" Either lots of people are having this problem, or they are completely incompetent.That said, the grill cooks fantastically. I love cooking on it. If only the coating didn't peel...and if only the warranty was actually a warranty."
3,Great as a waffle maker and electric fryer pan!,"The George Foreman GRP90WGR Next Grilleration Removable-Plate Grill with 5 Plates, Red --works great; however for grilling meats- such a pork chops I would not recommend it. It steams them more so-- than grills them. Not the same as an outdoor grill at all. I have to say, used as a waffle iron it works fantastically. Make sure to use cooking spray however--or they will stick to the trays big time! No timer on the grill so you have to watch the waffles to make sure they don't over cook. Works great for as an electric fry top for things such as eggs too. Easy to store away. Easy to clean. I place the trays right in the dishwasher- and easy as eureka!"
1,My experience was negative,"I read a great deal of positive comments about this product, but when I used it, the bottom grill just doesn't get the job done. Waffles were never cooked through and inedible. We tried cooking a steak, and the bottom grill never got hot enough. Very disappointing product."
4,Learning Process,"A new way of cooking. I think when I learn how to easily snap in the differn't plates, it will be a great cooking tool. One must takes ones time"
1,"Non-Stick??, Don't make me laugh!!","My first use of this defective, poorly constructed grill was a disaster. I futzed around for 20 minutes before I could get the removable plates to fit and latch, and even then the attachment was far from secure. I prepared my standard, tried and true, waffle batter, warmed up the G5 until the light went out, and added the batter. The waffled cooked fine, in a reasonable time, but stuck to the grill like there was Gorilla Glue in the batter (see picture). It took a half-hour to scrape the grill plates clean with the useless, little plastic spatulas supplied with the grill. By the time I was done, the family had made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for breakfast.It's definitly NOT a fat reducing grill if you have to grease it every time you use it, and calling it non-stick is clearly fraudulent advertusing!! I'll eat toaster waffles before I use this again!"
2,George Foreman Grill,I had high hopes given the utility of the original grill. This one does not work well. Waffles are impossible and it takes twice the time to cook anything!
3,hot air convention is better!,"As far a grill goes the foreman is good quality. HOWEVER, it you want your meat to be juicy, use one of the small round convention ovens that are on the market(for about 100 bucks). Don't waste your money on the oven size or micro-oven ones they don't do the job! My foreman only comes out during faita time and even the skillet is starting to take it's place because it does the same job and cleanup is easier."
4,removable plates worth it!,"I was surprised at how much I like this grill and how much I use it. I was contemplating buying the cheaper one with the permanent plates then this one came up on sale for 69 so I went this way. Glad I did since the removable plates make it a super versatile little grill. I have made hot dogs, sausages, waffles, chicken, and omelets (bought the separate omelet plates). Easy to clean and small footprint. Great purchase."
4,christmas present,I got this for my mom (it was on her wish list) the only thing that would make it better is if they included a bigger cookbook! Thanx!
4,Amazing Little Red Box,"Cooks my steak in about 3mins. that all i ask of it. =)Very easy to clean and the retractable plates are great, although i havent tried out the baking plate....cant figure what i would use it for just yet."
5,Grilleration is awesome!,"Works great, got it for a awesome black friday price ($50) and love it, can't say much more. Love amazon!"
5,Love this grill,"Love this grill, love that I can remove plates and wash them. Temperature control is perfect. I use it at work and am completely satisfied."
2,Love/Hate relationship with this grill,"I love/hate this grill.Love:The plates are interchangeableI can pop the plates out and put them in the dishwasher (main thing I love)Hate:The plates wiggle when snapped inIt is bulky, and takes up at least twice as much room in my cabinets than my previous George Foreman grill due to all the plates that don't nest or stack at all in the cabinetIt gets hotter on the outside than my previous George Foreman, and the 1, 2, 3 temperature dial is definitely a step down from my previous one that had a digital temperature setting - although they don't make that model anymoreI just don't know if the fact that I can put the plates in the dishwasher makes up for the bulky mess it makes in my cabinet and that is doesn't feel very sturdy despite being heavy. I wish I could have my old grill back, but it sadly no longer works and the model is no longer made."
1,Stopped working,I have only had this product 3 1/2 months and it has quit working. I dont have any idea how to get it replaced since it was shipped from Amazon. It did a great job when it was working but now it has no power. Its a shame it wont last longer then this
5,Fantastic Product,"We bought this product for ourselves 18 months ago. We use it frequently to grill delicious steaks, chicken, and fish in just minutes. The hinged back allows the meat to grill evenly. The removeable teflon coated grill plates makes for easy clean up. We have enjoyed our grill so much, we purchased this one for our granddaughter. She is off to college and will have 3 roommates. It will make it easy for them to grill, make panini's or even waffles with the variety of grill plates.I highly recommend this product. We bought both of the grills from Amazon and appreciate the free prompt delivery."
5,Outstanding Grill,"I bought the grill as a gift for my single daughter for Christmas. She reports that it does a fantastic job on every aspect of the grill. All the plates and the grill perform as advertised. The hinged top allows for any thickness of sandwich or meat and grills them to ""perfection"" in her own words. The shipping and service from Amazon was right on and it arrived in perfect condition. I've used Amazon.com for several other purchases and I've always been extremely pleased."
4,Loose Grill Plates,"As other people have said....The top grill plates are not held in securely, ---THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS, very dangerous... ****To correct this, loosen the two screws on each side of the top, insert a single edge ""Razor Blade"" on each side. Leave the safe edge protruding 1/16 of an inch over the sides of the bracket that the top plate fastens to. then tighten the two screws on both sides of the top.Now the Grill is Great... ***THIS WILL HELP OTHERS***(I do wish there was a plain top plate) ---Ralph S White--- L.A. Calif."
3,Good and Not-So Good,"Good news: Great service from the vendor and the grill works fine for burgers, potatoes, panini etc. I love that the plates can be removed and washed in the dishwasher. It heats fast and is nicely designed.Not-so good news: We wanted this model because of the waffle plates option so we wouldn't need a separate waffle iron. We have not had good luck making waffles. The outside of the waffle is pale and the center is too brown."
1,go back to basics,"I, too, expected that this grill would be the same quality as other George Foreman products that I've used. Sadly, the plates fit poorly, heat unevenly, and have lost their ""nonstick"" coating in less than three months.It's just plain awful."
3,Huge disappointment,"This is my second foreman, the first one I used so much, the nonstick coating wore off, so it was time to upgrade. I figured the one thing the traditional Foreman needed was removable grill plates to make it easier to clean - and wow they made it. BUT, here is the problem - 90% of the use comes from cooking chicken or hamburgers... on the basic grill plates. In the G5, they replaced the standard top grill plate with some highly textured design which makes the food look very pretty, but it is a nightmare to clean. No matter what you cook, it gets stuck in the little corners and either you accept it as flavoring the next time you cook, or you spend an inordinate amount of time scrubbing one little piece. -Hence my title ""Huge disappointment"". They came so close to a great product, but it is such a pain to use, I find that it typically gets stuck in the back of the closet with the other misfit appliances."
4,Everything I expected,"Comparing this to my last foreman grill, there are some ups and downs.Pro:Removable plates.Dishwasher safe plates. Just stick it in and it comes out clean. Even the top grill that people complain are hard to scrub because of the design.Temperature settings.Red color.You can leave it plugged in since there is an off setting on the knob.Comes with two drip trays, two spatulas, and a cook book.Comes with extra plates for baking, making eggs, and making waffles.Cons:It doesn't cook as fast as my last foreman grill. I was able to cook a frozen turkey burger on that one in about 4 minutes. This one takes closer to 8 minutes on the highest setting.It's not angled as high so not all the fit drips off of meat.Overall, I am pretty happy with it. I got it for $79.99 shipped from Amazon and it only took 3 days to get here with super saver shipping. Cheapest price anywhere and really fast shipping."
5,"great grill, more versatile than ever","If you've tried the other Forman grills, you'll like this one even better.very versatile and easy to clean."
2,Foreman grill,"The price is fair, the unit is awkward. Clean up is on the one hand easy due to the removable grills, however upon opening the top grill after use, the drippings fall behind the unit making for difficult clean up.The unit functions well enough, better in ways the former ones failed to."
5,Great indoor grill,"This is a great indoor grill to have around. It does what an outdoor grill can do. The clean up is very easy. The only thing to watch out for is that this grill gets HOT, even when you set the temp to mid."
5,George Forman G5 Grilleration!,"This product is the best thing ever! Sturdy, excellent quality, looks good in my teeny tiny kitchen!The interchangeable plates are easy to remove and put back on.The non-stick surfaces of the plates are easy to clean.I cook delicious grilled food on it all the time. A time saver,diet helper, the fat just drains off!! I have made everything on it fromchicken kabobs to pecan pancakes to burgers and salmon to waffles!I love it! You gotta get cha one!"
5,George Foreman G5 Grill,"My husband and I love this grill! So much so that we've purchased the extra omelet plates and, this Christmas, purchased another one to give to our son and daughter-in-law! It does an excellent job of cooking everything we put on it and, unlike other grills, is easy to clean and maintain."
3,Some problems with this one!,"I wanted one bigger than the one I had and thought having waffle iron plates would be a nice addition. But unlike my smaller one this new one was too clumbsy to move around and the heating seems uneven. I made waffles and it definitely had some hot spots which made for some uneven cooked waffles. I really don't mind cleaning my smaller grill, it was easy and this new one has a top plate pattern that is harder to clean. I like how simple the other one is and will return this new one for the next size up from my old one."
2,Very poor for the money,"I've had this grill for about a year and a half. I use it regularly and I think it has a couple major flaws.The ""Steak Plate"" for the top has a kind of cross hatch pattern that is extremely difficult to clean. It ends up with carbonized food in the corners that is nearly impossible to get completely clean. The plates will go in the dishwasher, but the top one still doesn't come clean.The bottom plate is the traditional straight grill that my previous George Foreman grill came with and it isn't a problem. Unfortunately there isn't a straight plate to use on the top.The second complaint I have is the heat adjustment. It worked poorly to start with, heat adjustment didn't have very fine control. Recently while cleaning the adjustment knob fell apart. I was able to put it back together, but something internally isn't right and the adjustment only turns about 1/4 turn.I like the color, the size, the handles and the concept, but the product has a couple major design flaws."
3,"In some ways better, in some ways worse","I already had and loved the GRP99 when I saw this new G5. All the new plates got me so excited I bought two G5s (one for me and one for a friend). When I ordered the G5 I figured I would get everything the GRP99 has, plus all the new plates. Not so. The G5 plates are slightly smaller than the GRP99, but not a lot smaller. I can live with them, but I was a little disappointed. However, my biggest disappointment was with the instructions (or lack thereof) and recipe book (or lack thereof). My old GRP99 had come with a digital temperature setting and a 215 page recipe book (retail value $25). The new G5 comes with a High/Medium/Low dial (but no documentation to tell you what temperature each represents), a two page ""Suggested Cooking Chart"", and two pages of recipes. So, for those non-cooks like me that need all the help they can get, the G5 doesn't include much help. I was a little disappointed."
4,Great Grill,"I recently purchased two of these grills. I really love mine and it stays out on the counter for quick use. I have found, however, that I need to cook on high more than the cookbook states."
1,George Foreman Grill,"I am sure this is a good grill. However, it arrived with the clips for both grill plates broken. So it was unusable. I haven't heard back from Amazon on how to rectify this situation."
2,Too poorly made,My plates would not lock in securely and the levelling lock did not work at all. Had no choice but to return it!
5,Food made quick,"George Foreman GRP90WGR Next Generation Removable Plate Grill w\5 Plates.Made one mistake, and that was not getting the additional plate for Omelets that was avaiable because this is one awesome indoor grilling machine. Keep the fat out of your cooking, and body with the drainage system, and make dinner in a snap. Saves time, and money."
5,I Love This Thing!,This thing is absolutely amazing!! I grill ALL the time. Its super simple to use and so fast!!! LOVE IT
5,I absolutely LOVE this grill!,"Best grill ever! You can have waffles for breakfast, grilled cheese for lunch, and either grilled steak of chicken for dinner. Also great for grilling vegetables and tofu."
1,The Beast,This grill is bigger than a laptop computer and weighs as much as two gallons of milk. The changeable plates sound like a good idea but they are at best cumbersome and require dedicated storage space. After two weeks of staring at the beast I sold it. I will stick to my original Foreman grill.
3,"Grills ok, but not all.","I wanted an appliance that would do it all, especially make waffles unfortunately, this is not the one."
2,versatile but cheaply constructed,"This is the fifth Foreman Grill that I have owned. It is the most versatile but it is much more cheaply constructed than any of the earlier versions. The enclosed cook book, paticularly in light of the versatility is a joke with only 7 recipies while the previous grills came with very nice and complete recipe books. And there is NO information on how to best utilize the various plates. What a shame to develop and sell five different plates - a great idea - but then leave it to the imagination of the consumer to how to use each of these plates - a very bad idea.I will certainly not recommend this product to others. I look forward to Foreman offering alternative plates to the previous Next Generation Grill which is a much better product. But maybe they have just decided to milk the brand and we will not see any improvements or accessories for the real superb Next Generation"
1,George Foreman GRP90WGR - avoid,"Looked good, read some reviews that sounded good, so I ordered it. Right out of the box 2 screws fell out of the unit and something was rattling around in the bottom - below the sealed heating element.In addition to the unit being defective ""out of the box"", I was not at all impressed by the design, especially the plastic base the grill is attached to.Returned this unit, did more research & bought the Cuisinart. Cooking surface is a little smaller, however the unit also has changeable grill plates, is MUCH sturdier, and has more temperature conrtol options. For the same price."
1,Do not waste your money,"This is about the worst kitchen appliance I have ever purchased.I should have bought it at a retailer that will take back a product thatis not a good product, after using it a few times.DO NOT waste your $ 130."
1,WASTE OF HARD EARNED MONEY,I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT LOOKING FOR AN INDOOR GRILL TO REPLACE A HAMILTON BEACH GRILL I LOVED.THIS IS JUST A REMAKE OF THE OLD OLD HAMBURGER GRILLERS THAT MAKE THE OUT SIDE LIKE SHOE LEATHER AND THE INSIDE IS OK.
2,What's Up With the Tiny Short Power Cord?!?,"Great grill and I love the separate attachments for different grilling. My partner's crazy about it but I can never quite get used to the fact it's somewhat awkward. And, let's face it. While clean-up isn't a major chore, there's still clean-up, so I'm not sure where all the claims of it being so low maintenance come from.The main problem I have with this appliance however is the fact the power cord is short. Like REALLY SHORT. The full length of the cord is less than 2 ft. but remember a portion of that goes under the appliance. You're going to have problems with this grill if a power outlet is not directly at and unobscured from the counter top. That's a problem for most of us when you want to place the grill to cook under the stove vent hood.Very poor design which hopefully will be considered for improvement."
4,Love for Cooking,"I've had my GRP90WGR for several months now and my boyfriend and I love to cook with it. Cleaning, initially, was a huge problem, but we learned from reading other reviews to place a wet cloth or paper towels in the grill once you're done and come back about 15 minutes later when the grill is cooler. We still get the black sooty powder if we hand or machine wash the entire plate, but 99% of the time, we can avoid it. Just keep that in mind when you store the extra plates - I have mine in a plastic bin in my cabinets."
3,indoor griller,Hey- this is a cool product. It really makes good waffles and grilled meat. Easy to clean!Wasn't too happy with the baking feature- doesn't cook- only burns the outside and the inside is raw.
4,Great grill,Easy to clean. Love the interchangeable grill inserts. Only problem is that it takes a little longer to cook than suggested in the directions. Needed to turn the heat higher than suggested.
2,Stopped working after few uses,"I've had this grill for a few years, but only took it out rarely since it was so bulky. I was planning on making waffle treats for the holidays and half-way through baking, the machine just turned off and never turned on again. I had already regretted the purchase since there are so many interchangeable plates, the grill with plates took up a entire shelf of my pantry. I'm in an apartment short on space so this was a major inconvenience. Previously I would have only recommended it for someone who has plenty of counter and storage space, now I don't recommend it at all."
5,Really great grill,"This grill has totally lived up to my expectations. I love the size and especially the interchangable plates. It does everything well. It makes great waffles and there is plenty of room for burgers and chicken and without any messy splatter that you get with a pan. I loved my old George Forman grill, but it was just too small and it was hard to clean the attached plates. Now I have everything, size, versitility and easy cleaning."
5,George Forman,"AWESOME!!! Had the small original george and hated it due to clean up and size, but this is wonderful. Love the removable plates (which are dishwasher safe :-)) and is large enough to cook a family meal at 1 time."
3,Nonstick coating came of after several months of light use,"We have owned this grill for about four months, and I realized the other day that the coating on the removable plates started to come off. I need to call the customer service and ask for a replacement plate, could you please post that info?Until this recent defect, the unit has been great, very convenient, a time and space saver in the kitchen. I am giving three stars for the defect, and will update it based on my experience with the customer service.UPDATE (1 star):Even though our purchase was still under warranty, Salton was not willing to send us any replacement plates. They said they are out of stock two months ago, and are still ""out of stock"" as of last week, God knows if they will ever have these plates again. A terrible experience, will never buy from them again."
4,Nifty little grill,"We had the original Foreman years ago and it was just about done. I had been wanting this one for a while because of the removable plates so when amazon had them on sale, we bought it.It's great! The plates clean so easily. I like that I can make waffles, paninis, and grill meat all on the same machine.So far the only downside is when I use just the bottom griddle plate, it takes FOREVER to cook something. I had grilled cheese sandwiches on there for 12 minutes and it still wasn't crusty and brown on the bottom. I had to finish cooking them in a pan on the stove. Today I tried to make french toast on it, same thing. I even set it to high and let it heat up for a while, but it just doesn't get hot enough.It works great when we use both a top and a bottom plate though!"
2,"Cheaply Made, rattle trap that squeaks.","So disappointing...I would have thought that after years of developing an appliance like this that the manufacturers and developers would have put a little quality into the item. Apparently not. It is plasticized, , hinges squeak horribly, and the drip tray is a plastic tray you sit on the counter in front of the grill....no sliding action, no hidden tray, just a plastic , what could be dangerously hot, grease filled tray, sitting on the counter. I am dumbfounded at the cheapness of this product. I would not expect a lot more for a hundred dollars, but I do hope my review saves someone else from spending their hard earned money on this.It cooks fine. The design I am sure suits some people. However, I know what quality is and this is not close. Sorry."
1,Amazon is selling factory rejects?,"I ordered two of these items, mine was scratched and the handle bent. My daughters smoked and had a smell to it. If these are factory rejects, shouldn't Amazon.com have to say so in their descriptions? I'm not saying this against George Foreman...but I don't appreciate purchasing two of these, and both having problems. Makes on think."
2,Near junk,"We haven't used it yet, in fact we were going to return it, but the loss was too much (shipping back plus original ""free"" shipping charge back). The plates do not fit well, very poor quality. The plate handles don't hold well. The handles hit when unit is closed for storage. The linkage for the forward lean mechanism is very loose. The red finish on the top isn't that good either. Very dissapointed."
1,Bad Attitude,"This is about Salton's customer service, not this particular grill. I purchased a similar item (see my review of the Foreman GRP99 elsewhere, and also note that many customers were treated just as shabbily by Salton as I was. Or worse). And note that many GRP99s did a meltdown (among other things).I'm quite puzzled that some don't find it helpful to know that a vendor is completely indifferent to customer complaints.SALTON IS THE WORST THAT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED."
1,George Foreman Next Grilleration Grill,"I was very dissappointed in this machine for several reasons. First, you cannot put two fish steaks, beef steaks or any other kind of meat side-by-side if they are not the exact same thickness. The thicker piece will cook and the other will not. The thicker piece keeps the top grill from contacting the thinner piece of meat.Also, the grill just does not get hot enough to really sear a piece of meat properly. This is probably a safety issue.I plan to continue using it, but only for limited applications"
1,Horrible - Avoid at all cost,"What a piece of garbage! wobbly plates, shoddy construction.The handles on the plate barely hold them to the grill body. The main grill plates (with the lines) broke in the first week.This thing makes me sad to look at it, should have sent it back right away, now we are looking at getting another brand and this POS is going where it belongs - the recycling center.Way to go, whoever you are that makes this crap. Geo Forman is LHMFAO right now. Stupid white people, paying good money for garbage...The GF brand is not only dead to me but, like Sony, I shall proselytize their awfulness to the heights."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I had the old grill, but hated the cleanup, so when we started dieting again, I really wanted one that had the removable plates. This works great and cleanup is super easy. I use this grill 3-4 times a week now. The only thing is, the extra plates are a bit of a pain to store, but hate to complain as I really wanted the extra plates as I wanted a waffle maker."
2,Top plate is awful!,"This is my 3rd GF Grill. I bought this unit in 2010 and have used it since then. From day 1, the top plate was a nightmare to clean! There are around 300 nooks and cranny's on this plate and so cleaning it can take an hour! After over 2 years of usage, it drives me nuts. So much so, that I'm about to get rid of this unit and buy something different.It works well enough as a grill, but cleaning that top plate is a very lengthy chore!!!You've been warned."
5,GRP90WGR Grille,"I bought this to replace same model we have now. The price was so good, I could not pass it up. The one we are using still works great, but one of the plates was sticking too much, the plates are only available 5 to a set, which cost almost as much as the grille, which comes with 5 plates. YES WE would recommend this to your customers."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this George Foreman grill. It doesn't brown the meat and only makes ""grill lines"". The food does not have a good taste nor does it look appetizing."
3,George Foreman GRP90WGR Next Grilleration Electric Nonstick Grill with 5 Removable Plates,love the concept. I purchased the grill for my 16 year old son so he could cook safely without burning the house down. Turns out my 12 year old used it more than he. The problem we have is the titling function. It broke within 3 months of use so it won't lock in the flat position which makes it impossible to use it for anything other than drip grilling. Other than that this is a perfect way to introduce your kids into cooking for themselves. And the ease of cleaning makes it perfect for kids too!
5,Great Grill,I purchased this grill as a Christmas gift for my brother's family. They told me they have used it a lot already and like it very much. Success!
4,Excellent grill.....but,"I love this grill...the removable plates are fantastic. However, the main plate for the top has a funky design and it's a little cumbersome to clean. You really have to get into the little nooks and cranies to get all the food particles. I wish they would have made a universal top exactly like the bottom and clean up would really be a breeze. One other thing, the handle for the grill protrudes a bit to much and may cause a problem if you have shallow cabinet space.Other than these 2 little quirks, it's a great product."
4,Absolutely Love!,I've had the new Grilleraton for about 2 weeks now and have used it almost every day. I was very pleased at how easy the plates are to change and clean. I have yet to use the waffle plates. But so far I say it's a must for every busy kitchen!
5,Much better than I expected,"We had a similar grill like this years ago, but it sucked. The hinge didn't float like this one and ended up cooking things very unevenly. This one is much better and despite my initial hesitance, we plunked down the $130 and I'm happy to say it does very well. Tried cookies but didn't think they were better than my oven, but waffles seem to be getting high marks on the reviews. I got it for meat and it did chicken very well. I recommend it and I'll probably get one for my mom."
2,"OH, GEORGE - YOU LET US DOWN!!","I bought this item, dreaming about making the best grilled cheese & panini sandwiches ever!!! TOO BAD!!This small appliance takes quite a while to warm up, and never reaches a high enough temperature to toast the bread, before the cheese is melted all over the place! Just about the opposite is true of waffles, using this appliance!! They come out really crunchy, but not retaining enough heat to melt the butter!!!GEORGE - WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?!?! DID YOU TEST THIS THING OUT??!! ACK!! THE GRILL WORKS, THOUGH..."
1,Would be a 5 star but no replacement steak plates available,"Hopefully the manufacturer pays attention to the reviews. We have loved having our GF grill since 2008 but I refuse to buy another grill because they do not manufacture spares of the most used plate! The Teflon coating on the bottom has started to peel off making it a hazard. Part Number 22741 is the bottom plate but oddly is not listed on the GF replacement part site you find in the manual - http://directpartsandproducts(dot)com/indoor-grills-grp90wgr-c-61_171_1017_1029_1033.htmlEven thought they still are making this grill it appears there are no replacement parts of the most used parts! Guess I will have ""waffled"" steaks until I can get a replacement or until I toss the unit into the dumpster - what a waste!"
4,George Forman grill,The G5 grill performs better than I expected.The interchangable grill plates lets it serve several functions.It is agreat way to cook bacon with no mess and very little fat.
5,got for christmas,"I only had this a few weeks, but have used it for waffles, hambergers and steaks and chicken.. good to have only one appliance that does it all."
2,Did I get a lemon??,"I loved my old, original Foreman grill and wanted to enlarge. I was very disappointed because it will not get HOT enough and the waffles were soft from lack of heat. I would not recommend it..unless I did get a ""lemon"""
5,George Foreman grill,Love this grill! It makes great waffles and I really like the three temperature settings. Washing is a breeze.
5,Geo. Foreman next generation grill,"A must for every ones kitchen. There is just about nothing that you can't cook on this grill. Steaks on the grill are great, season your meat as you normally would for your barbaque pit, lay your steak on the grill and put the lid down. Within a few minutes the steak is done, juicy minus the fat."
4,"No budget, plenty laughs!","It's amazing what you can do nowadays with no money but a good helping of talent. This low budget double feature embraces the cheesy wondefulness of old B movies and produces two wacky, goofy comedies that had me laughing throughout. Plus the whole family can watch!"
3,"Yo,A Wonderful DVD.","...But lets say its a female 007 parody(Sorry,Holly Berry).Kind of like ""KILL BILL"" with laughs.Those Ninja villians,silly/bumbling ninjas.Opening credits Were,Very 007 style.""My Fair Lady"" of spy farces.The classic""Pill In The Drink Glass""scene has been replaced here."
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"I bought both programs, fair at best and you need to buy other products to do the workout."
5,Best book by Dana Ransom,This is the beginning book of the Texas series and it is definitely the best one. If you like western romances you'll like this one.
1,This is not a good drying rack,I did not like this drying rack. The bottles never seemed to get dry because they sat down to far. They also fell off easily. I purchased a less expensive drying rack that I loved and still use even for other things.
3,Great Product-wish there was more room though,This product does not hold enough for me!I usually have to find a different place to hold the bottles etc.. to dry.
5,great-but bad bottle brush-I recommend...,This is great!! Get a Munchkin bottlebrush though. It has a sponge on the end as well as the tiny (hidden removable) brush in the other side of the handle.
1,Don't Bother If You Use Dr. Brown's Bottles!!,"We use Dr. Brown's bottles so there are 5 pieces to dry PER BOTTLE. This rack isn't large enough to dry more than 2 bottles at a time which is frustrating because our sterilizer holds way more than 2 bottles.I guess if you don't use Dr. Brown's bottles this rack may serve it's purpose, but when I find a better rack I'll let you know."
4,Does what it is suppose to do,This drying rack is good. The scrub brush that comes with it is good for skinny bottles and the nipples of the bottle but not for wide bottles. Overall I am satisfied but I wish the rack had suctions on the bottom of it too keep it from sliding when you touch it.
4,Extremely useful!,"We love this product! It's so easy to organize all of our bottles on this drying rack, and it is small enough to not get in the way. We use VentAire bottles, which each have 5 pieces, and we are still able to organize them well. I like that it comes with a bottle brush, but it honestly isn't the best one on the market (which is why I have only given this 4 stars). I recommend spending a couple of extra dollars and getting the Munchkin 2 in 1 bottle brush. I don't believe that they carry it on this site, but you should be able to get it in a Babies R Us or Target store."
3,It's ok....,"The rack has enought space to put 6 avent bottles or 8 regular bottles.... The only problem is that they would normally falls down because the rack is too weak.... but whatever!! is just 10 bucks, and they do fit a lot of bottles..."
3,Falling Bottles,There is enough space for to meet most hand washing or stove top sterilizing needs. The major drawback is that the front row of bottle holders tilts forward and the bottles fall off.
2,Didn't work with Avent or Dr. Brown's,This rack worked great when our daughter used the Playtex Ventaire bottles but it totally stunk when she was using teh Avent and Dr. Brown's wide neck bottels. They were jsut too wide to fit in the rack. Add the collars and nipples were all too big to fit in the compartment. We really had problems when we had all teh pieces of the Dr. Brown's to deal with too. We tried a couple other drying racks too...Prince Lionheart and Munchkins...but we never found one that really worked for us. Most times we just washed them and laid them on a towel on the counter to dry
2,Not that Great,"I registered for this product thinking it would be a great asset. Like other reviewers, found this drying rack to be difficult to use if you use wide neck bottles. Also the compartment for holding bottle tops was very flimsy and would not stay in place. My advise go with another brand."
2,Not terrible...not great.,"We use Dr. Brown's bottles and I bought this in hopes of keeping everything organized. It does a marginally satisfactory job. I can keep enough of the parts in it, but they aren't organized...more like piled. If you use Dr. Brown's bottles, you might not be happy."
1,Flimzy for the bigger bottles,"For my baby's 8oz Avent bottles, the front racks could not handle the weight and it would drop them in the sink. Also, the brush is very stiff and would not get the bottom of the bottles cleaned."
5,Better than a towel!,"I originally just put my pacifiers, bottles, nipples, caps and breast pump pieces on a towel to dry after sterilizing. I'm glad I bought this because the items seem to dry faster. Plus, on the towel, the inside of the bottles didn't dry, rather they seemed to fog up because the water wasn't draining well. I think it's worth the money."
2,Great for Bottles...Not Great for Toddler Cups,"I really loved this drying rack when my son only used bottles. It even worked good for smaller sippy cups. But now that we have large sippy cups, I can only fit maybe 4 cups on it to dry. And we go through a lot more than that! It still works great at holding all the lids and valves, just not the cups."
1,Buy Another Brand,"This bottle rack only works well with 4oz. bottles. As soon as you switch to bigger ones, not only is there not enough room, the supports are not strong enough and the bottles fall all over the place."
2,Drove me crazy,"This drying rack drove us crazy. We placed the rack on a shelf above the sink. When the holder was full, it would constantly fall over and the bottles would end up in the sink. I say buy another brand"
2,not useful for us,"We use Gerber bottles. It didn't fit anything we needed it for so we threw it out. Fortunately it didn't cost too much. Couldn't return it as we did try to use it once or twice, but it didn't work out for us."
2,A little cramped,I keep 10 bottles in this at the moment. It is a little cramped with just that. Bottle brush is poor quality. Bottom legs pop off at will. This item could have been made much better.
2,Don't bother...,"I breastfed, and even after she started using sippy cups & bottles, I rarely used this rack. It's sitting dusty on the shelf. What a waste of money, at least for me."
1,I didn't need it...,"After purchasing and using it once that's what I came to find. I was told by everyone to just put the bottles and nipples in the dishwasher, because the tempertures are as if I was steralizing. Who knows, maybe I'll use it in the future for sippy cups or something, but I highly doubt it."
3,If it was bigger it would be perfect,"This item is great for keeping your babies bottle accessories seperate from the household dishes. The only complaint I have is it is too small. It it was bigger and accommodated more items, it would be perfect. I like the set up of the rack and the sturdiness of it, but it is way too small."
2,Bottles Fall Over,"I registered for this drying rack and was very unhappy. The bottle pegs fold for storage, but mine don't stay up at all. Mine fall over even when there are no bottles in it. My bottles are always falling into the sink. Now I just use my regular dish rack. It works so much better and holds more bottles."
2,Don't Bother,We are constantly having to rewash things because they fall over into the sink. The parts were the bottles go are not very strong and don't support the bottles. Also you can't use it for large bottles. Try another brand.
5,I love it!!,"This drying rack is wonderful! My baby would not nurse so he is strictly bottle-fed, so we always have a lot of bottles to wash!This rack holds all the bottles, nipples, caps and the nipple rings! I have small bottles, big bottles, fat bottles and skinny bottles this rack holds them all!If you have a lot of bottles to wash all the time (even good for sippy cups!), I totally recommend this rack."
3,great but wears down with a hole,"I love these bibs, I had bought 4 of them. Unfortunately, they are softer than the original ones but the softnenss make them wear down fast. I used them for 6 months, and in the bottom pocket's mid section wears down with a hole. This happened to all of them. The original ones that are harder plastics, do not have this problem. I had an original one from my older son, 2 years ago, still good and can be washed in dish washer."
2,Not very useful,"I have a number of Baby Bjorn items and love most of them except for that bib. They tend to combine three qualities I love about baby products: quality/durability, ease of use, and attractive design. Therefore when I saw these bibs in the store I bought them expecting to be amazed yet again. After all, I was getting pretty tired of washing cotton ones. My son was about 6-8 months at the time.I did not like this bib. I have to concede that it is very attractive and extremely easy to wash/clean, but it is made of hard plastic material which my son found uncomfortable and constraining. It didn't flow with his movement and since he kept on fidgeting when I put the bib on, food ended up everywhere. Also the strap in the back bit into his skin when he tried to pull it off. I used it a total of 3 times and ended up throwing it away. Don't waste your money on this - go to your local Target/Kohls and get a regular waterproof bib. It will be both cheaper and more practical."
2,What an expensive bust.,What an expensive bust. My twin boys are 12 months and they just rip them right off and they don't fit behind their highchair tray.
5,easy to use & clean,I highly recommend this product for baby meal time. It's very soft and cute. You maybe love it. Esay to use and clean.
4,Ecological!!!,"These bibs are really great. EASY to wash (by hand or top rack in dishwasher). We only own one bib and it lasted through 2 kids!! I never had to use cloth bibs or have a ton of bibs on hand.Only downside is it may be a bit big (long) to fit some kids in a highchair. When our 2nd son wore it, it bumped a lot on his highchair which he didn't like."
4,Very nice but rather small,"I do like these bibs quite a lot, however I must admit that I did not realize that they would be as small as they are - particularly around the neck. Overall, however, they are very nice and quite functional."
2,Good for younger children... I guess,"My friend recommended these to me, but I couldn't find them anywhere. So when I saw them on Amazon I bought them right away. Too bad they are WAY too small for my almost- 2 year old... I guess I'll save them for my newborn and hopefully they will live up to expectations.EDITED ONE YEAR LATER:I thought I'd make more use of these with my daughter, but they are just too tight around the neck. A waste of my $"
2,Not soft!,"I bought these bibs for my 10 month old who doesn't like wearing a bib anymore. I thought at least these would be soft (as the name implies) and that he may like to chew on them the way he does his kiddopotamus table place mat. Not so! These bibs are not at all soft, and the way it fastens around the neck hardly holds together even if you are not trying to pull it off. These bibs are a great idea in theory, but in my opinion, Baby Bjorn needs to work on the design of the product."
2,My baby hates this bib.,"I want to love this bib. We have many Baby Bjorn products and this, by far, is the least useful. The plastic bib might work well IF the baby is willing to wear.My baby hates it when he started baby food at 7 month old (he now is 20 mo.) He refused to wear, crying, trying to rip the bib off (thanks to the snap disclosure, he couldn't) and finally stopping eating because this bib annoyed him so much. I had to change a softer yet still waterproof bib. I've made my baby wear it several times. He still goes crazy when I put this on him. I hate to see a well design product useless and will save it for my friend's baby."
4,"Baby break-in period, but happier mommy","PROS+ Easy to clean or dishwasher safe (don't have to ""surface wipe"" only or put a million bibs in washer)+ Adjustable neck+ can catch a lot, especially when drinks spillCONS- Break-in period for baby (he tried yanking off a lot and fussed, but eventually got use to it)- A bit stiff so if baby has short torso (or high chair pushes against), it'll ride up"
2,"So far, not working out...","As far as waterproofness and easy clean, these are great, but so far, these do not fit my 9 month olds. The bibs are too rigid for my twins - no matter how I adjust the neck strap, these seem to slip up and the neck gets caught in their mouths, so they can't eat and can't move it back under their chins themselves... I am hoping they will fit them better in another month, but so far, these just aren't working for us."
5,Best bibs ever,These bibs are hands down the best bibs for feeding solids! They fit my big 6 month old with room to spare if needed. Just wash and rinse to clean. Wish I would have used them with my first child.
4,good product,These are easy to clean up and get on and off. But my 6month old son has learned how to take it off sometimes if he yanks up on it. he also sometimes gets distracted by the bib because he loves to lift it to his face which he does not do with other bibs.
3,Has potential to be good!,"I can appreciate these for the fact that they wash off so easily, unlike the cloth ones that get soaked in food and drink. However, they are pretty stiff and uncomfortable-looking for my daughter, also a bit too large for her so I'm going to re-try them in a couple months (she's 8 months old now). She keeps trying to take it off because it fits her awkwardly and is very distracting for her.Back to cloth for now!"
5,Must-have bibs!!!,All I can say is that I wish I purchased these bibs six months ago. I can't begin to figure out the amount of time I have saved on hand-washing and stain-spotting cloth bibs. I would recommend these to anyone!
5,Fantastic bibs!,"These bibs are the best I've purchased ever! They are very easy to put on (even my daughter helps put them on my toddler), my toddler hasn't yet figured out (or tried) taking them off. They are simple to clean. Well worth the price, as they can be used over and over again--free of smells and stains!The little ""catch"" pouch is fantastic. I'll put the bib on my toddler, with food inside while driving in the van. So he's got a snack right in reach as well as a place for it to fall."
5,Baby can't pull it off,"I wish I had this bib months ago. Our little one hates bibs and immediately tries to pull them off. She has the velcro closure ones off in seconds. Secondly, she likes to spit out a lot of liquid when she's drinking out of her sippy cup. This bib solves both problems! It's easy to get on but she can't pull it off herself. And all of the water she spits out just collects in the tray instead of her clothes. It's a breeze to clean. I highly recommend this bib!"
4,super useful!,"These have been perfect for my 1-year-old. They catch most of the stuff she drops (except for the bits she holds at arms length and tosses to the floor), and she can't take them off herself. They're also very easy to clean. A quick wipe down is usually sufficient, or I can toss them in the dishwasher on the top rack."
4,Teething baby thinks it's great for chewing on.,"I bought of a couple of these for my daughter to use with her son. I had given her the Joovy high chair that people love but complain that there is a bit too much of a gap between the baby and the tray. I was going to head off this problem by supplying these bibs. However, my daughter had no complaint about how the baby fit in the high chair, and the baby (at 6 months) just wanted to chew on the bibs. She'll try them again when he's a bit older.Because of this I gave the bibs 4 stars, but I wish there were the option of writing a review without giving a rating, because sometimes something really great can just not be good in a particular situation."
3,Not good for older babies,I bought these bibs for my 10 month old son and I have tried multiple times to put them on him and he immediately pulls them off. He hates wearing them. I love how they are very easy to clean. I should have started using them earlier but my son only recently has become a messy eater.
2,not impressed,"I was looking forward to using this bib to reduce mess created at feeding times and based on other mother reviews I had read. However, what I found was that my 8mo daughter manages to pull the bib away from her chest, tucking her chin down onto her chest (so it pops under the bib) and starts teething on the bumpy plastic neckline. She then proceeds to empty out the food (thats been caught in the pocket) all over herself and the floor. Unfortunately for me, I feel that these bibs have not been worth the money I spent."
2,Not very flexible,"My daughter is on year old and apparently not big enough to use this bib. If she is in her high chair, when she leans forward to pick up food, this bib hits the tray or her lap and comes up to hit her in the chin. She really hated it. Maybe we'll try it when she gets a bit bigger."
3,Almost the best bib out there but............,"I was so hoping to write a review saying this is absolutely the best bib on the market and it was initially! I was delighted to find a bib that really worked for my 14 month old twins, was a great design, color and easy to clean. At this point 5 star all the way. So what went wrong? My babies learnt that if they pulled hard enough, they could simply pull them off. And for those of you who have twins, you know how it goes, one works it out and the other one copies him. The great design with a pouch that is rigid, stays open and actually catches the food, it was so good but please Babybjorn design a bib with a different closure for my escape artists! If your baby doesn't work out how to get the bib off and there isn't another baby to show him how then this is a fantastic bib!BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Green"
5,best bibs ever,These are the best bibs ever i bought for 7 months old baby he is almost 1 year old i still use them everyday easy to wash and some times he throws up these bibs save lots of work me just take it off no dirty clothes just wash the bib but some times in the begining baby doesn't like it to wear i still put it on cause save me lots work :))))))))
1,skip it,"Kids hate it, too rigid, very high quality though, maybe your kids will like but there is no flex to is at all."
4,"Great, but a little thick in the base.","We love these for our 6 month old, especially after feeding him for several weeks using terry cloth bibs which get SO dirty and are hard to clean. The one problem we've had is with the ""trough"" at the bottom of the bib. It's so large that we can't fit the tray of baby's high chair on the chair while he's wearing the bib! Anyone else have this problem?"
3,Takes a while for baby to get used to...,"My 10 month old has no problem ripping this bib off. I had to teach him to keep it on. It took him a few days to get used to, but it is a valuable bib to take to restaurants since the food falls into the bib instead of on his lap."
4,Great bib until my 13mo figured out how to take it off!,"I've been desperately looking for a bib for my very messy 13mo. She hates wearing bibs and loves to rip them off. Based on everyone's review, I ordered the Baby Bjorn bib hoping it would solve our problems. The bib itself is great - it catches food and keeps everything off my daughter when she wears it. However, she's so strong and has learned to pull it right off! I would have easily given the bib 5 stars but since my daughter can rip it off, I've knocked it down to 4. I'm off to trying l/s smock/bibs!"
2,Did not work for my little one,"After reading the reviews, I thought this product would be great but it didn't work with my little one. The plastic is sturdy and feels like good quality (hence the 2 stars) but it's not easy to put on and once it is on, my baby could easily take it off or just pull on it and chew on the collar. It's not comfortable and I would recommend to any Mom to just buy some dark Cotton/polyster bibs and throw them in the wash after each use. They are soft and easy to work with. If you prefer plastic, the softer ones are better."
2,Far too easy for toddlers to remove- don't buy.,"We ordered these bibs out of desperation because our 16-month-old twins have mastered the art of removing velcro bibs. Some reviews of the single bibs and of these 2-packs on other sites indicated that these were very difficult to remove and that they stayed on better than any other bibs on the market. That is not the case for our sons at all. One figured out how to undo it (with one hand, no less) within a day, and the other within a few weeks. The material itself is easy to clean and we loved the pocket, but that does us no good since the boys don't keep them on! I really don't see how any baby over, say, 9 months wouldn't figure this out in a heartbeat and be throwing it on the floor like our kids do. Stick with bibs that snap (if you can find them) rather than ordering these."
2,Not good enough,"I really wish Baby Bjorn would have started messing with products that used to be so good... I have a 9-year-old who had a similar bib when she was little, and we LOVED it. It was much softer, and much larger. It was completely round along the sides, without this weird S-shape, and it definitely caught more food.The newer models aren't as soft. The funky closure mechanism always gets my baby's hair caught in it (ouch!), and worst of all, the cut-out shape means food now ends up all around the bib, and not in the bib pocket where it should go. All my baby has to do is turn his head sideways to mess up.On the bright side, these bibs do wash really well. I've even stuck them in the dishwasher, and they came out just fine.So here's my plea to Baby Bjorn: RETURN YOUR OLD BIB STYLE BACK, PLEASE. They used to be much much better."
1,Baby hated it,"The bibs were far smaller than I thought, and the baby felt like choking. He pulled it and cried every time he wore it. They are very cute but were of no use for me."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased these bibs for my 6 month old son. The bibs, while easy to clean, are not big enough for an infant who is eating solids. They let food in under the chin onto his clothes. I have accidentally pinched him in the clasp. The bibs don't cover enough of him, so the food ends up on his clothes all over."
1,Baby hated it,Maybe should have started earlier than at nine months. She hated it and soon figured how to yank it off. Not worth the expense.
2,Too stiff,"Right now, I don't like these because they are stiff and hard to stuff down the high chair tray. They get caught because they are stiff and seem to poke him in the neck. He seems to stiffen up and not like these. They don't feel comfortable.I will keep trying to use them as they seem practical, but right not they seem like they might choke him if they get caught between the tray and his neck.Wish they were softer.."
3,"worked well for awhile, then cracked","I loved these bibs for about a year, then they both cracked in the bottom of the catcher and were pretty useless if my toddler was eating or drinking anything soft enough to get through the crack. We much prefer the Kiddopotamus bibs, they're more flexible so they can roll up in the diaper bag (these are too stiff to roll like those do) and they are dishwasher safe and less expensive. For our next baby we're sticking with the Kiddopotamus bibs for sure."
2,Unconfortable bibs for your little ones,Great product but my sons hate those bibs as soon as they feel it coming the start to cry. If you have a chubby baby do not waste you money in this ones since the neck part is very small it may work for small babies buy not for chubby babies or regular size babies. The material is to hard for them. Buy it only if your baby has a long neck or a very tiny neck.
3,so-so,I like these bibs but my 8 month old son does not. They clean up great and are strong. He doesn't like it around his neck and so I've put them away for now. He might like them in a few months.
1,We didn't like it at all.,"We got one of these as a gift, but never successfully used it. The crumb catcher at the bottom prevents us from putting the highchair tray all the way back up next to the baby. But what's worse is our baby totally HATED it - would not wear it for anything. He was fine with any other kind of soft plastic or cloth bib - guess he hated the firmness of it."
5,"Very easy to handle, wash and does not hurt the baby's neck","I bought these thinking I was making a bet because I was afraid these would hear my twin babies' necks. But they do not hurt at all. They are very soft and the way they close around the neck is perfect.I have other similar products, but these are the most used ones because they are very easy to clean and wash."
5,Best bibs EVER.,"They clean up easily, they catch food, they stay on, and they don't smell. No other bibs on the market are as good as these ones!"
5,Best Bib Ever,"We have about 5 of these now. I LOVE THEM. Prior to finding this wonderful bib, we were buying the off-the-shelf Target bibs with ""food catcher"" on them. Those bibs were literally destroyed after using them just a few times. For just a little more money, we decided to try these Baby Bjorn bibs and could not be happier. They catch everything perfectly, they are SO easy to wash... even if you forget about them for a day or 2. They are dish washer safe, they LAST. It's the last feeding bib I will ever have to buy. Would recommend to ANYONE for mealtime eating!"
3,Smaller than expected,"My daughter is almost one year old and she is very messy during her meal, so I thought these bib were just right for her. They're nice, but very small and she doesn't like the the strap in the back.I guess I keep them and try later to see if she will like them better...but maybe they will be too small at this time.At the end I think that product is a good quality but still over price, and definitly too small."
3,Soft Bib,"Not so soft and so wide baby can't hold a bottle around it. Probably won't buy more. Also, cord to close around neck is a little stiff and if I'm not careful, I poke the baby in the eye."
2,Not the best for my little guy,"I know that I'm in the minority here, but these bibs were not the best for my son. They are quite stiff and would get caught on the high chair tray quite often (we use the Chicco 360 high chair that attaches to the table top). The neck piece also doesn't seem too comfortable. I use fabric bibs that slip on over the head almost exclusively and they seem to be more comfortable as well as catch more of the mess around the arms/shoulders (he's learning to feed himself, so we have food everywhere!). I'm sure these work for some, but not for us."
1,Disappointing,"I figured with all the great reviews these bibs would be awesome. I feel like I really wasted my money. I used these with my daughter when she was around 6m old. She pulled it up and started chewing on the neck part. If I made it tighter she just tugged and tugged on it. Plus, I figured they would be bigger and a bit softer. They are too stiff and don't fit comfortably in front of her in between the tray and her body. She is now 13m and we still don't use them. Wish I could get back what I paid for them. The food pocket catcher is nice, but if it can't fit down between her and the tray it does no good. Now I'm searching for a good long-sleeved bib."
3,"Love it, but my baby can rip this off, too!","When I purchased these bibs (I have twins), it was because one of my babies kept pulling all of his Velcro bibs off. I was so tired of it. So I bit the bullet and bought two of these bibs for $20. That's a huge price IMO. They worked great from 7-11 months. But now my baby can pull it off as well. I'm stuck on what to use now. He's a strong little man. I can't find anything that can stay on. Oh well."
3,Too small for 20-month old baby,"I have been looking for the perfect waterproof bib easy to clean and mold-free so I bought the BABYBJORN. Unfortunately it is too small for my 20-month old baby boy. On top of that, my son hated it. I am saving them for my second baby boy to be born sometime this month. I am giving it three starts because it looks very well made and it should works as advertised."
5,A Must Have,These bibs will save you lots of clean up time and LAUNDRY! I can't say enough about them!
2,son refuse to wear it,"My son is 9 months old. He simply refuses to wear it. I cant test whether it can function or not, while it turns out a waste to me."
3,too small,The closure for the bib was neat but was on the largest link when my son was only 7 months. He noticed the bib more than he has any other and insisted on holding it up in front of his face. The Baby Bjorn bib just didn't work for us.
2,Can pull right off!,"I am sad to say this bib would be perfect if it would just stay on. My daughter tugs it right off. Other than that it is perfect. The pouch keeps her lap clean, catches all the food she drops, and wipes right up. Perfect! If it would only stay on..."
4,Great Bib,These bibs are great with one small problem. The adjustable neck is soft and comfortable for my baby. They are insanely easy to clean. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is they are too thin. They would be perfect if they were just a little wider.
5,BbyBjorn soft Bib - good but expensive,"This is clearly a superior product to many of the alternatives. Easy to clean, good shape etc. I do wish it was a little larger and so would also fit a larger child. Price is a bit high, would not have bought it if there wasn't a discount at the time."
2,nice design not well made,"I bought this mask for my grandson to wear when he is shooting his airsoft pistol. the first time he wore it the foam rubber pads on the inside of the mask came off. Two of the little crommetts that holds it together came off. My husband tried to repair the mask. The design is great and it protects the eyes and face, BUT the workmanship of the mask is pretty shoddy. I bought 2 of the masks and they both had the same problem. Work on the quality of the product and the mask will be great."
3,Broken strap,"For a mask that's less than $5, I really can't complain much. My only real gripe is that the clip on the mask where the strap is attached broke after the first couple hours use. That's not such a big deal but, the way it is made, there isn't an easy way to repair it.On the positive side:- It works great at protecting the wearer- Visibility is good, as good as any other mask I've used- Likewise for airflow & general comfort (though the nose-piece could use a bit of padding...)Overall, it is a good mask to have as a backup and I will likely order another but I'll also likely make a few modifications before taking it into the field."
5,"Epic for looks,Fights,AndProtection",This Is the mast your looking for for the fight Youve been waiting For this will blcok of ANY bbs My friend shot me with a 550 FPS and No Scratch i Highley Recomend this to All Airsoft users.
1,breaking,what ever the price dont get this mask in an airsoft arena i was shot and it went through the plastic get a better mask with abs plaseic
2,Customer service,"While the masks are sufficient for their use, this was the worst purchase ever. Shipping was as much as the masks and we had to beg them for the product. When I first started an inquiry on the shipping delay it took 5 emails for them to say what was wrong. I was accused of stealing (in my opinion) because I wanted the products or a full refund. The actually arrived mid January when they were ordered mid November. I have never heard the words ""we are sorry"""
1,Warning Do Not BUY,"Total junk ,cheap,no elasticity in the strap no padding for facewould not be worth it even at a dollar store"
1,Not as it apears,"this mask is extremely uncomfortable, as the metal rivets dig into the bridge of your nose. It isn't the pictured mask either, its a much cheaper mask. The sides of the mask arent tight against your face, leaving room to ricochet in and cause some serious eye damage. not to mention the mask just looks ugly. NOT THE MASK PICTURED!just go by this rule of thumb: If you want quality airsoft supplies[..]"
2,Cool Mask but cheap,"Cool looking mask with great protection for the entire face. The wire mesh is a smart solution to the fogging up problem with other masks. But the ""chain is only as strong as the weakest link"", the rivets/buttons that hold the mouth portion to the goggles are made of cheap plastic. My son played two one hour games and three out of five rivets are gone. If you look at the stock photo on this site you can see for yourself that one rivet is missing from the right side of the goggles. You will never guess what country made this product, it has the letters c h i n a in it. Not all is lost, with a few short screws you can reattach the mask."
1,My eyes.,"They're right. This will stop BBs. But it makes them explode on contact with the wire mesh. My friend shot me full auto in the face with his 300 FPS uzi. My eyes were sprayed with multiple plastic fragments. I think this should be reviewed by some safety organization and banned from the market. The area where I was hit by fragments got sliced up pretty good by the plastic bb fragments, I never knew that they could do this much damage. Buyer beware, do NOT buy this for your children! Just save up and buy a goggle and mask set."
1,You Guy's Don't Realize Something....,"You don't want one of these masks. Many people have commented on their durability, claiming when you shoot a round point blank into one the mask is holding up, just getting dented. However, in reality the rounds are actually getting shredded apart by the metal wire mesh. What this means for you is that you got a dozen sharp tiny pieces of plastic coming at your eyes now, not one big BB. Don't buy these things, they really are bad news."
4,Airsoft Proof!,"I shot this mask with an ECHO-1 614 on fully Auto at 5 feet and it survived!You can see the tiny indentions where the BB's hit the metal, and in some spots it chipped the paint off the mesh but that's it.Not super comfortable but its wearable.It is also very awkward to aim with this mask on. Its face part gets in the way!At least you're not getting fog!All in all, this product is much better than I thought it would be.4 Stars"
1,Airsoft Metal Screen Mask,This product looks much better in the picture than it really is. I bought this item as a Christmas present for my son. The rivets that held the goggles to the face shield were not fastened properly so the product fell apart in my son's hands as he pulled it from the package. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $20 for a better product... your child will be much happier... and safer!!
2,wow!,this mask is horriblei bought it for my son and the goggle part is fine but the little plastic bolts that are (supposed) to hold the mask and goggles together fall apart. i had to thread string through mine to keep it together. good mask if it didnt fall apart in a week
1,CHEAP TOY. Not what I was expecting.,Bought this for my son after doing some searching and seemed like this would be the best in our budget (and on sale) for him to play airsoft. When we received the mask it was in packaging that reminded me of something that would be found at a dollar store. When my son put the mask on it did fit his face but the elastic strap was so old it was completed dried out and had lost its elasticity. I was able to dig in my crafting supplies to create a new strap.The one thing that gets me is the original cost of this TOY (as it is described on the packaging) was $25? I truly doubt it. Most likely $1 and they marked it up for those people like me who know little about airsoft and the proper gear.
2,Changed my mind now,"In my last review I gave it 5 stars. The Backstreet Boys have less than they ever did, and they don't attract me a damn bit."
5,"I&#65533;m reviewing four songs, not this whole album.","Jeepers! This is the first time I ever gave five stars to an album by a group familiar among teens, but it's for these reasons: the songs ""Larger Than Life,"" the super-popular ""I Want It That Way,"" ""Show Me The Meaning of being Lonely"" (it's the best on the CD!) and ""The Perfect Fan."" Still, they ought to get it going on with Italy's Andrea Bocelli, which I very much doubt they ever will. The end."
4,Shamira is a great teacher for beginners!,"I have recently gotten interested into bellydancing and the only available video for me was Shamira's. Shamira includes a warm -up and goes through many basic movements. For someone who is unable to go to a class to learn bellydancing, Shamira's tape is excellent and can be done by all people of different sizes and shapes. This tape is definitly reccommended for even first time beginners."
1,"self-promotion, not dance instruction",Low instructional value -- the artist seems to regard the genre of dance-instruction videotape as a means of self-promotion.Playing up major assets -- face and upper body -- results in a video next to useless for a student of BELLYdance.
2,........where is my old review..........????????????,"I wrote an review about this one and now it is gone. Why?? because I gave it only two stars?? David can sing no doubt about that, but his stage performance was and is terrible on this dvd. I like most of his songs very much, but the way he is acting in front for a group over-aged screaming old women is awfull, sorry to say I know but it is the truth.For the music 4 starrs, for the picture 0 starrs, so an average of 2 starrs because it is a dvd and not a audio cd.Sorry fans, if you read my review of his Cherish album then you would know I am a fan, but I try to be honset, sorry again..."
3,not that great 3+?,"I give this a 3+ stars, I really didn't like it and I am pushing it with a 3+ stars. I basicly was boared with this DVD, I guess I am not a true David Cassidy fan but I do like his music, I just like it better on the Partrige family show instead of live."
3,"So pretty, but not good enough","When I received this in the mail, I was very pleased with the look of it. The jewels were so much prettier in person. Unfortunately like someone said about one of the other items in the collection, they fall off very easily. I think I've had it only about a month. I figured if they did fall off, I would just glue them back on. Unfortunately for me,they fell off without me noticing and I can't find them now. I'm very upset with how my tumbler looks now since it is missing 5 of the jewels.I do definitely recommend it on looks, that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1, but just wish they had used more heavy duty glue for the jewels."
5,how metal is played,omen plays straight ahead metal. i hope they come back together and make a new album.
3,Auto-Reverse Sorely Missed,"Right size,right weight,exceptional mic pick-up.Playback clear and distinct.Good volume.Having not purchased such a device in many years,I overlooked not insuring an ""auto-reverse"" feature.Rewind also exceptionally ""slow"". Then again,for the price, not much argument to be made."
4,Good value and performance,"I bought this recorder to use as I conducted interviews for my thesis. Overall it does a great job--the sound quality is pretty good and the microphone works well. I especially like the pause feature for when I am transcribing the tapes. My only complaint is that this pause feature is hard to use when typing because of the shape of the recorder--if I set it on its side it is wobbly and falls down when I use the pause switch, while if I set it on its back so it won't fall over the pause switch cannot easily be flipped. But considering the price and the otherwise good quality of the product, I would still recommend it."
3,For the Non-Digital Folks in Your Life,"I teach a counseling skills course at a local community college, and needed this for the students to turn in an audio recording of an interview. Not all students are into the digital realities of today, so this analog tape recorder did the trick.I gave it three stars, 'cause it only runs on batteries ... there's no where to plug in an A/C adaptor (my preference).If ya gotta go tape, this unit is alright."
3,good except the headphone jack,"Maybe I am technically incompetent, but the headphone jack is too small. I hadn't expected it to come with one, but it said it did, so I got excited. I tried two different pairs of headphones and they won't fit.Other than that, it's been a good product so far."
3,good for casual use,"I needed a small recorder for taking notes at meetings. For the price, this recorder picks up the voices adequately if you are in close proximity of the conversations and you make sure you have the microphone pointing in the right direction. I only gave this recorder 3 stars because my generic headphones did not fit in this recorder, so listening without the benefits of earphones requires a quiet place."
3,i didn't get the product I purchased,"The address in the box was OK, but the product inside the box was something else (a selector switch). Please contact me or DHL to find the right product."
5,Excellent! How to do radio right!,"Cooke does a masterful job. Smart radio is a lot like common sense - not very common! Read this and learn from the guy who was operations manager of DC's award winning all-news station, WTOP, and now makes his living as ""the expert from out of town"" brought in to fix distressed radio stations all over the US."
2,Not Worth The Money,This really contained very info on actual crate training. The majority of the book talked about introducing your puppy to the crate not a lot of info on actual crate training process. You can get just as much info googling about crate training on the web.
4,Helpful information and tips,"This book has been helpful in its tips on how to: choose a crate, introduce your pup to the crate, and the schedule required so that your pup doesn't soil itself in the crate. We find that we still refer to the book every now and then for help on some issues. We found that a blanket or toy helped our pup immediately take to the crate. Also, Cesar Millan's approach to crating helped a lot too (like not making a big deal of leaving or coming home). Now our pup goes to its crate when it's tired or afraid -- or when it tries to sneak a shoe away. :-)"
1,Don't bother,After getting my new puppy I thought I would need some tips on the crate training subject.It turns out there is very little to discuss on this topic.Toss a treat in the crate and allow the crate to become part of the routine and the dog is happy.The book didn't discuss anything beyond common sense.It's more of a flyer than a book anyway - not much substance!
3,Quick Basic and To the Point,Quick & Easy Crate Training is both quick and easy to follow. It gives the complete rationale and best practices to ensure a happy relationship between owner and pet. Recommend reading before bringing home your puppy.
3,Somewhat helpful,"I purchased this book and a few others to help me crate train my puppy. While it is informative, it doesn't address the issues I was having (the screaming, howling, chewing on the crate bars, ect). It's a good read, but does not cover all the issues one can encounter with crate training."
1,Michael G. Finley,"The product says Woodline USA and the product I received was not Woodline and not made in the USA. Woodworkers know if you by products made in China, you will end up buying that product again and very soon if you continue to use it frequently."
3,Misleading price,"I have no quarrel with the quality of Woodline bits, however the pricing listed here is misleading. The NORMAL price in the Woodline catlog has been for as long as I've had a catlog and still is in their current catalog 199. You could of course buy it here for 219 but I have no idea why. The retail price that is listed is bogus."
5,In the spirit of Joy Divisions revolution,"With the first notes Adie Newton takes you on a journey to a dark, tragic and harsh, yet somehow comforting world. It is the next step Ian Curtis (Joy Division) hasn't been able to take."
5,BUY THIS BOOK!,"If you have any need to know about content management, document management or information management,buy this book! This book dissects and discusses the subject at various levels of detail, so any reader will be able to find the correct level of discussion for his or her needs. I am going to be working on a CMS system, so Idevoured this book. I believe I have a good feel for the problems and pitfalls I will run into on the project. And I know I will be referring to this book as the project progresses.Thank you so much for writing this book! It's a life saver!"
5,"Informative, helpful, written well, a must for your collection on CMS","This book is a required textbook for my online graduate publishing course at Pace University. I have enjoyed the book and the wealth of information it provides. It is informative and written well for anyone to understand. The examples and diagrams are terrific as well as the snippets from people in the business industry using CMS. At the end of my course in May 2006, this book will definitely be on my bookshelf and used on the job. I highly recommond this book for anyone."
2,"Mediocre Theme, good fighting scenes","I would not recommend this movie at all. First of all, the theme is just the very old revenge clash with love type, like all of Kim Yong's fictions. This is among one of the unsuccessful Kim Yong stories. The best would probably be Condor Hero and Return of the Condor Heros. Book and Sword is good too. As for the TV series making, it's made for the naive audience. Even my mom laughed at the silly plots, so many flaws to the logic of the story line."
5,Pete Gooding Is The Man,"For anyone that has been to Ibiza and chilled at Cafe Del Mar or Mambo you you will love this album. For anyone that hasn't ... you will love this album. Pete Gooding mix's up the best in ambiance for the first CD and then gets phunky on the house tip for the second. But unlike other types of these Ibiza compilations that can drag, Pete makes sure he keeps it moving and his mixing skills and track selection are right on the money. This alubum truly represents Ibiza and if you are ever on the white island stop by Mambo and peep Mr. Gooding on the one's and two's."
3,A topical and easy-to-read primer for new F1 fans,"This ""ultimate"" guide to F1 -- featuring a short introduction by Damon Hill -- bills itself as ""The Definitive Illustrated Guide to Grand Prix Motor Racing."" I think that's an overstatement, but this lightly written volume contains all the statistics and stories one would want, in a non-technical style that makes it a perfect introduction for new Formula One enthusiasts."
4,"Oh, come on!","One star from two reviewers? Oh come on! This book is hilarious! OK, Hawes does get a little bogged down here and there describing the plight of his clueless protagonist -- who actually, reminds one a lot of the title character in ""The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret"" -- but this is way, way, better than one stars. I actually still chuckle over scenes from the book, having read it years ago. I place this one well ahead of a White Merc with Fins, in contrast to the previous two reviewers."
1,Total Letdown!,"greatly anticipated this&#151;Hawes' sophomore effort after the excellent A White Merc With Fins&#151;and found it resoundingly unsatisfying. The plot follows an early-30ish married, successful Londoner as his fiddling with his company's books result in the attention of Inland Revenue. Suddenly desperate to pay off the authorities and maintain his standard of living, he is forced into bed (yes, literally and figuratively) with Russian mafia/bizness concern, all of which leads to some silly tie-in with oil pipelines and British and American intelligence. What is much more interesting than all this, however, is the internal musing on the nature and uses of sex in the the protagonists' life. While there are some good bits here and there, I found it to be a rather annoying book in the end. This may be partially a result of my raised expectations after loving A White Merc With Fins so much. His next book, Dead Long Enough, was a rather mixed effort."
3,Better than the movie,"The cable guy by Harriet Grey was just like the movie, it was exactly the same. The book was a lot better than the movie just because the book went more into detail why things where going on. The book was very funny, if your like comedys this book is for you, also if you like serous movies because you could kind of take it as a syco type movie. But I think its better for people who like comedys."
2,"Yes, I read this, why, I don't know.","I won't go as low as hating it but I was stretching it by giving it two stars. More like 1 1/2. I never saw the movie so I have no idea which is better but if the big screen version was the same as the book, then I can understand why my friends said it was terrible and don't bother seeing it. This book was boring from page one. I'm one of those people who have to finish a book once I start reading it so I had no way out but to read to the end. The main character comes across as a complete nutter to be honest. A lonely nutter at that. He decides to befriend one of his customers who really wants nothing to do with the cable guy. As much as he tries, he can't rid himself of him though. And that's the whole plot of the book! Pretty exciting huh! NOT. Don't bother. Unless you see it for a penny at a yard sale."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I bought 2, being stupid and thinking they would surely fit my standard-size, 7"", Coby DVD players. They did not. When I went to return them, they said that, in addition to paying the return shipping, I had to pay a $15 ""restocking fee""! So, $25 to return 2 items totalling $33?! Also, the return policy is very tricky and time-consuming, akin to those ""we hope you get so frustrated you never fill it out"" rebate cards.As to the product, I ordered 2 of the same thing, and 1 is differnent than the other! They are shoddy and have a lot of different places where the craftmanship seems poor.Overall, below average product from a company with horrible service- if you're going to roll the dice on the low price, good luck!"
3,"Good Product, Wrong Size","This case seemed well-made, but I had to return it because it was incompatible with the Philips PET710 7"" Widescreen Portable DVD Player that I had also ordered, and which I had intended to store in the case. Specifically, when in the case I was unable to adjust the volume on the player; and the case did not accommodate the power cord plug for use in vehicles. Finally, I could not use the remote at all, because the case blocked the remote sensor on the player. Perhaps this case will work better with players other than the Philips model that I ordered?"
5,Sacred rips it up!,"I stumbled on this album after not hearing anything from these guys in a while, and I couldn't wait to rip it open and force feed the cd player!The music is classic Sacred with the live sound, and they sound like it was one great show to have seen.NO TRUTH.......NO JUSTICE!When are they coming out with another album? I have all their music and some of the EP's which I had to dig up. An excellent live album, and a must for any Sacred fan! ! ! !"
1,Wish there was a lower rating I could give,"Do NOT waste your money on this! The movie is super boring, acting sucks, film quality very poor. Before buying it I had read how it looked ""documentary style."" Not like any documentaries I've ever seen! Even the ones done with basic camcorders have more film appeal than this movie.It really is a shame because a LOT more could've been done with this theme."
2,very strange,"Though well acted, well directed, somehow it misses something. I don't agree with the message that protecting the true pedophile was a good thing, just because it would have hurt his widow. I also would like to know why Amazon lists this among ""gay"" movies, this isn't a gay movie. Does Amazon think gay people are interested in pedophilic movies? Come on, Amazon, this isn't a gay film."
1,Is this a joke?,You don't know if this movie is meant seriously in some strange way or joking about a serious issue. Especialy the acting of the main characters was like in a school play. The innocent one acts as if he is very guilty no matter what the story says. I don't know if he was meant to be or he just is. A very weak movie.
1,02 26 2009,don't be suckered by the Bruce webber picture on the coverits better than the filmthe film is elementary at best - looks like it was filmed for a high school class.If you get off on dialog then buy itotherwise this is a stinkerstay away and save your money
1,Misleading reviews,"Four stars for this movie is quite a stretch. Although the subject matter was interesting, the acting was atrocious, the music melodramatic; in general, a really bad movie."
2,Return to Acting School,"I am NOT a professional movie critic but I still can fine a bad movie. The story line was good, not as good as the novel, but I have yet to see a movie that's better than the book. I felt the actors were being carried through thier lines. They felt hollow and unconvincing to me. I felt that the relationship between Chris and Tommy should of been given more time on the film. To be thrown in to thier relationship, without decent actors, created an empty void for me. I also felt the Black & White aspect of the film degrated the film even further. It looked cheap and homemade. Though this topic is highly taboo in America today, it still should of been made to show how this type of ""LOVE"" truly begins and that all things aren't always as the seem to be on the surface. Thus breaking the darkness that surrounds people who love those how turly care about them. Regardless of gender, skin, or age difference."
2,Return to Innocence Another Way,"The good thing about this movie is the point it's making.And some of the cinematography was nice.The difficult subject matter at hand is in itself, well treated, but deserves a better herald than this movie.Its ultracheap production values and wooden performances, sometimes laughable when really they should be emotional moments, make this in a way a lamentable effort.The plot is too predictable and you end up watching the movie for the wrong reason.............."
4,A Salutary Narrative,"For his directorial debut, Rocky Costanzo has chosen an uncommonly ambitious story that tries to comment on child abuse and the prejudices surrounding an intergenerational relationship. Unfortunately for him though, the screenplay by Gary Frazier touches on issues of homosexuality and pedophilia, which even in the hands of an experienced director may have been difficult to get across the factual emotions and reactions necessary to lift the film from the level of simple drama to that of extraordinary motion picture. Occasional missteps cause this film to get abandoned somewhere along the way, but despite its flaws, it is an affecting film and surprisingly good for someone's directorial debut."
3,OK - for what it is . . .,"This tackle box and included fishing equipment is 'OK'. I got it for my 4 year old grandson to go with his Spider Man fishing rod.It is OK for him - a few bobbers, etc. The tackle box is fine for a beginner.I would not recommend this for an adult.Not too expensive - not much equipment - tackle box adequate for the size. What else can I say?"
1,Cityguide to Vienna,"When you like Vienna and not be able to buy a proper cityguide on VHS or DVD you can buy this DVD. When you are looking for a good piece of music with the joy of Strauß then do not buy this CD. The quality is worse, performance is even worser! I heared better for less!"
1,"Deceiving book, Mediocre formulated and anodyne strategy","This is not a good business strategy book. The author develops with mediocrity his theory applied to business, which he considers to be revolutionary, to the point that includes a manifesto at the end of the book. The true is that It lacks of real and strong examples of companies that have succeeded by implementing the strategy of preventing broken windows, or in other words have paid attention to small details. If you want to read about anecdotes of poor service in many of the most famous American companies, you should buy this book, but if you do expect to read about an intelligent strategy that can yield long term results in your company, don't waste your time and money.."
2,Extended Text on a Basic Theory,"Author borrowed an established theory, stated it in short order, and then proceeded to rehash original comments to extend it into a book rather than the pamphlet it was intended to fill."
2,"""A Dour, Hectoring Treatise...""","""A Dour, Hectoring Treatise..."" says the reviewer from Publsihers Weekly. It is an entirely just criticism, as this is possibly the most downbeat book on achieving business success that I've ever read. While the premise is intriguing, the actual substance of the book is pretty thin. Yes, we know that details are important and that the little things do matter. Yet, the author's idea of good business practice seems to be to obsessively micromanage every aspect of your business and of your employees' behavior. Do yourself a favor and read anything by Seth Godin, instead of this condescending drivel. Seth says, ""Stop trying to be perfect and start being remarkable."" I couldn't agree more."
2,Disappointing,"This book does exactly what it tells us not to do. It's a long-winded attempt to say ""keep your work area clean, treat your customers well, and stay one step in front of the competition"". The book attempts to address case studies, but then doesn't give useful information about how bad decisions were made or what were the results. Many times the author says that the customer ""might"" see something bad so they ""might"" think something bad and therefore won't do business with you again. the book would be more useful if it identified how many times ""might"" actually occurred and gave better examples.And then the section about ""don't have broken windows in the first place"" -- geez, if i knew how to avoid them, i would not have purchased the book."
1,Plodding and Poorly Constructed,"The theory Levine espouses in the book may have merit, but his case studies as well as his overall tone are at best tedious-- at worst pedantic and over simplistic.There are many more better books to read with related subject matter, like ""The Tipping Point"""
4,Good customer service book,"This book is about the small yet impactful things every business should pay attention to to avoid slow failure. It covers management areas like brand, product management and customer loyalty, but superior customer service is at the base of all the recommendations. Excellent ideas for increasing customer loyalty in multiple areas across a business from the counter person in a coffee shop to the CEO and executive team. Every time you pick it up you'll find a new idea to fit your current business challenge or priority. Don't underestimate the importance of the subtle recommendations and you'll find you pick this book up more than once as you think about your business."
5,"A Long Needed Book!! Finally, a book about the Basics!!","I have got to tell you that a book like ""Broken Windows"" is long overdo.There has been way too much focus on all sorts of secondary issues while ignoring the basics of running a business. This book clearly explains what I have long thought.It talsks again and again about how businesses lose their way by forgetting what really counts. Its stories about such companies as McDonalds and KMart should be case studies in every business school in the world.This book brings back common sense to the world of business books."
2,difficult to understand a lot of the British dialog,"Occasionally, i have difficulty understanding United Kingdom English, and really need subtitles.......i'm a USA Southerner, needing English subtitles with some of these British dramas"
2,Copper,"We watched one episode. It was so dark that most of the time we had no idea what was going on. It might be a good show, just can't tell. We are getting a 52"" flat screen in a few weeks and will try one more episode to see if it features better on that format."
1,Remarkable,"How could the BBC and HBO do such a poor job? The true grit and integrity of performances we've come to expect from both British television and HBO was utterly lacking. What was Levinson thinking? We can usually count on him, too."
1,T'd be nice to know it's US playable only.,"I have no idea what this show is like. It won't play on my DVD player here in Australia. The DVD player says ""Wrong Region"", as does the Playstation. It apparently plays on my mum's PC but I don't want to watch it on there. I want to be in our nice living room and watch it with other people. Amazon should put a notice in the description if it plays international or when the international release is due to come out and which one that is when it does. Or have a link to a US DVD player with one of those wall socket converters."
3,Will watch another season.,I like historical period shows. This is a time period most oftern ignored. If you like Tom Weston-Jones you should check out World Without End Mini-Series.Rainy Day Mom
4,"Gritty, Spellbinding Melodrama Set in Slums of Old N.Y.","I am not sure how much research went into this project or how realistic it is. I am sure the result is hugely entertaining.Great sets, costumes and,overall, persuasive acting. I agree with the comment that the writing could be sharper and Corky's Irish accent is a little off, but Copper's head on confrontation with the harsh, often desperate, poverty endured by the immigrants, and characters who are flawed, complex people who feel real, pulled me in. I didn't feel the plot was unfocused--I particularly like the abrupt transitions from violence to tenderness and vice versa. And the mystery of Corky's lost family helped tie in several subplots, including an abortionist's murder and a child prostitute's precocious love for Corky.Overall, I give this a big recommend. Every episode unveiled (sometimes unnerving) surprises, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen."
4,Very interesting...,"To see such detail given for a TV time period piece is a delight. With only a preview to look at, I am intrigued. Looking forward to watching it in full glory."
4,Interesting twist,The development with Corcoran's wife was certainly an interesting twist. I am very interested to see what happens next. This episode was better than the most recent three or so.
4,WOW,"This is a great series. The cast, setting, costumes and story are first class. can't wait till the 2nd season comes out."
5,Copper Season 1,"This is old old fashioned police work. I'm a big fan of police shows and detective shows in general, but this one is even better because the detectives actually detect instead of waiting for the lab results to come in and then going after someone like in CSI which is starting to wear on me. There are some old style police beatings too, so be prepared for them."
3,okay for summer fare,"Interesting historical premise but not much history in plot. Violent. A formula soap opera, tortured soul as detective searching for lost loved one etc. etc."
3,Great Potential,"The setting has such promise, unfortunately I could get little sense of the story line since it seemed to be tangled in all the action. I will watch the first bits, but if Copper doesn't have substance it will end up in the 'Oh well' can."
5,Great B.B.C Production,"This was a very well done show. It is very violent show but that is how it was in New York city during the Civil War. The acting is tops, and you will enjoy it very much. Adult viewing."
3,"I wanted to love this, but it didn't happen","I really wanted to love this show. I did watch the entire series but it just didn't work for me. I wont be buying amy more seasons of it. The costumes were very authentic and the sets were pretty good also. Not quite sure why it didn't fully capture my interest. It is well made so it is worth a shot if you are interested in this time period. But there are better series out there, equally well made with more compelling characters and storylines, in my opinion."
5,Love this show!,"A must see. Great show great acting, if you like Justified this reminds me of that show. Can't wait til it comes back."
3,Set design isn't everything,"Ever since ""The Gangs of New York"" I have loved the ferment of Civil War New York. So I am primed to love this show, and the sets and costuming do not disappoint. However, much of the plot is nonsensical and the acting is wildly uneven. I'll keep watching, but I hope the rest of the show rises to the level of its surfaces."
3,falls short of potential,"A lot of effort went into creating this period piece, but the writing falls short. The story line isn't well developed and is totally unfocused. Also, the production would have been much better if the lead character had a real Irish accent."
4,Good period drama,"This is a solid, consistent period drama. I didn't knock my socks off, but I enjoyed watching the characters develop. It strikes me how precarious life was back then in NYC."
5,Great New Show,I thought it was a great new show. It played with history but still had an interesting story line. I just hope Kevin does not get hooked on some bad medicine.
1,what the hell is this?,"i bought this album when it came out because i was sick of thenew american ""metal"". what a waste of money. not to mentionthat ancient just tries to cash in on what's big at the time. they had their ""evil"" album, then the emperor type northern album, then this vampyric one. can you say cradle of filth. the girl on this album is horrible, her voice and her lousy poetry, what kind of stage name is that? not to mention the high pitched screeches of, ""i love you, i love you, i love you"", that's ridiculous. and the hip-hop drums and his little ""oh yeah"" bit.hahahaha. ""vampirize natasha"", natasha sounds like a black lady with braids,and i don't think that's what they were going for. this whole album is a cradle of filth rip off, and a cheesy one at that. the drums are almost as bad as the lyrics. the only reason i gave it one star is because it's good for a laugh once in a while. this is truly one of the silliest albums from ""her majesty"" Norway. END"
1,Not happy with item.,"I was very disappointed in edible white pearls. The pearls had no sheen to them, very mattecolor. The only good thing I can say is that the item came to my home very quickly. I will not be using these pearls on my daughter's wedding cake."
3,Pearls,Very hard could hardly bite through them. They looked great on the cake though. My daughter liked how they looked.
4,Adventure in Space,"""Satan's World"" by Poul Anderson, 1968, 1969Mr. Anderson is an old science fiction writer. This is a good story, more adventure than science, about his Polesotechnic League people. It is quite an adventure. David Falkayn gets thrown into the story and is saved by his boss and cohorts from an ignomious fate. The characters are pretty much stereotypes from mythology and history. I was surprised to realize that Nicholas van Rijn was based on Baron Von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, of Germany. There are aspects that are not appropiate to the Baron, but a lot of Mr. van Rijn's character is similar to what I read the Baron would have felt and done.There is a lot of daring do well in this story and some rather farfetched incidents that come out well. It is just amazing. Like Prof. Asimov and his pschohistoric saga, ""Foundation"", this is always peaceful to a fault. Quite a bit far from reality, but it is all science fiction."
5,Simply the Best Talmudic Dictionary There Is,"It took Marcus Jastrow 17 years to write this monumental dictionary. This is a must dictionary to have for anyone serious and sincere about learning Torah and Talmudic study. Jastrow brings down every word with it's definition(s) and examples of where that word is stated.Most importantly, I recommend the online version of this dictionary- the Tyndale Archive Jastrow Dictionary (just google it) as it is MUCH easier to navigate through (unless you need it on Shabbos of course)."
3,Great Book but archaic English,"This has some great thought and content and will obviously be around a lot longer than I will, but the archaic English makes it a difficult read.It takes a lot of time to maintain your focus. I not sure if anyone has translated a modern English version that would be more helpful. The price on this was free on KIndle, but for one of the great Christian Classics, I wish I had an easier to read version."
5,Great Edition of Classic Confessional,St. Augustine lived quite a wild life before his conversion. He tells the story of his life and how he came to his conversion. It is a classic Christian text.
3,A very human saint,"it's been awhile since I read it, but I was very interested in his initial lack oftotal faith considering his total writings. I liked how very human he was."
2,reading for class,this is a hard to follow version but good none the less. if i had to read it again i would find a different translation for easier reading
2,Not very interesting,I did not find this tome the least bit appealing or interesting;not up to my par! I prefer more modernly written books.
4,Pretty dang fun!,"Wow, I really dig it. It's like a fabulous mix of some electronica with something like The Roches or The Ditty Bops!"
2,Disney could of done better....,"Okay, I made that mistake and read the Prydain Chronicles before actually seeing this movie. Honestly I didn't think Disney did a good job on this film. Characters were left out and I didn't like how they merged ""The Book of Three"" and the ""Black Cauldron"" together. They changed some of the events a bit which didn't make sense to me and the movie seemed rushed, especially when it came to finding the black cauldron. I think this film would of done better as a live action movie, such as Disney's sucsessful ""Narnia"". And it could have been done in parts, since the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexandre consists of 5 books. 6 including ""The foundling"". Another thing I didn't like was that the movie was too dark, too scary for children to enjoy.I think I would of enjoyed the film more if I have never read the books. XD"
3,This movie is nothing like the books...,"The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander which include THE BLACK CAULDRON were among my favorites books when I was younger. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and I hated it because the only thing this movie has in common with the books are the names of the characters. I say the names of the characters, because for the most part, the characters portrayed in this movie are nothing like the characters in the book. I am now an adult, and I recently re-read the books and rented this DVD. I knew the movie would be nothing like the books this time and discovered the movie to be a good but dark adventure. So the bottom line is... If you are expecting this movie to reflect any characters or plots from the books, you will be very disappointed. If you want a Disney adventure movie, it's fine. However, it is too intense for young children !"
3,"Ok,but kind of dark.Odd for a Disney movie.","Like the review's title says,the movie is odd for somthing Disney would do. In my opinion,this movie is similar to the HarryPotter movies in that there is a lot of magic spells type of stuff.I don't think kids 2-6 years old should watch this as it is a creepy kind of movie."
3,Gurgi must die,"Unfortunately, the nasty little critter didn't stay dead. Gurgi is among the most unloveable of side kicks in Disney flicks. The animation was second rate and was not all of the same style throughout the movie so it had a feeling of many animators collaborating, but not communicating. It tried to be something new and different, but it fell pretty flat. The plot was VERY predictable and though based on a fairytale world, not very transporting. Oh well, better than no animation at all."
2,"Nice try, but no cigar.","There is a lot to say about the Black Cauldron... The music's great, the animation and effects are adequate... the story... what story? In the turmoil that was the ""next generation"" at Disney, the continuity and heart of The Black Cauldron got lost in the crowd. There are a few funny and scary moments, but for the most part this feature leaves a bad aftertaste. This is what happens when Disney tries to market a PG feature to a G audience... a lackluster product.If you are an animator or artist, you will find this film interesting. Otherwise, try something else."
5,Even better than I hoped,"The product was arrived just as described. The service was better than I expected, not only did the product ship fast but it arrived sooner than estimated."
5,Best Disney Movie Ever!,"If you're looking for a typical Disney movie then this isn't the one to see. It's the only Disney with a PG rating and is very dark. For those who don't like Disney, this is the movie to see. If you're looking for it to be like the books... sorry, but that's not necessarily what movies are about. This is an excellent show! A ""spell-binding saga of swords, sorcery, and magic!"""
1,WHY?,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's bad, even for Disney, and while I have issues with their versions of fairy tales, taking this kind of ""liberty"" with a set of wonderful books should be criminal. As a fan of the books, I was disgusted beyond belief. I watched it with my daughter, wanting to give it a chance, but I simply couldn't stand it. If you like the books, don't touch it with a ten foot pole. If you never read them, read them, then don't watch this. If you don't want to read them, still don't watch the movie, because it's bad by itself. Even Disney can do better than this."
3,Disney movie,Had great service from the company that sent it and my grandaughter is enjoying it very much.
3,Good but too scary for kids.,"The movie has a story line, but the animation was not for kids. My 2 yr. old nephew loves Gurgi but runs to me every time the Horned King comes on. I love this Disney movie, but it loses some of the characters from the book. Plus the use of dark colors contrasts with the lovely plot."
2,Most boring Disney movie ever!,I thought that the Horned King was creepier than Judge Claude Frollo himself and even Sleeping Beauty's Maleficent! What makes it even more boring though is that there is barely any plot in the movie! No wonder it failed in the box office!
3,May not be suitable for toddlers,"This is a different Disney flick from what most Moms' and Dads' expect. This is a dark movie with some very scary creatures for your little ones. The older kids may love the action/adventure, but be forewarned that your younger children may want to sleep with the light on after watching this movie."
1,go see 101 dalmations!,"A very disapointing movie that I think if any child saw he/she would have nightmares for the next week.scary, pointless and somewhat unusual for disney."
3,If you enjoy disney classics,"When I bought this item I did it in the soul purpose for my daudhter. Since she likes just about every stinking Disney movie out there...now I must remember she is 5. When we all sat down to watch the movie she lost intrest in 5-10 mins, I guess because the story line wasn't appealing to her, or the picture wasn't as sharp looking as the new movies. All I know she said ""mommy this is boring."" As an adult I find it a must to have if you collect Disney movies. I will admit this movie was very hard for me to find and I was surprized I found it on Amazon."
1,A Totally Botched Job,"Disney took what is perhaps the best 6 book young adult fantasy series ever written, combined the first two books, combined the books major bad guy with one of his minions (Arawn an the Horned King are NOT the same person) eliminated 2 of the ongoing good guys (Gwydion and Coll are not to be foumd), 2 of the Black Cauldron books 3 major bad guys (Morgant and Ellidyr) are gone. Then they took one of the series major heroes, Gurghi, changed him from an undersized bigfoot into this waist high dust mop with a Donald Duck voice. I remember talking one of my friends into seeing this with me in high school, he was just like dude-wtf? And I remember saying, I'm really sorry John, I didn;t know they were going to do this, the books are really cool.Anyway, this is a mortal sin from Disney. In the name if all that which does not suck, don't buy this if you've read the books first. If you haven't then perhaps rent then definitely read the books."
1,Um...........huh?,"I always wondered why this movie tanked at the box office. Now I know. This floundering animated feature from Disney should never have been let out of the vaults. One of the sub-plots concerns a clairvoyant pig, (!!!) who apparently can foretell the future by sticking it's head in a bowl of water. (How's that again???) Too frightening for children, and too ridiculous for adults, it's unclear which audience this movie was supposed to target. And then there's ""Gurgi"", one of the most annoying creations ever in an animated film........(let's not even go into that one.....) Your money would be much better spent on one of Disney's tried and true classics; certainly not on this drivel."
2,Here's hoping Disney has restored the cut footage...,"...there was about 9 minutes of completed footage cut from the final film that showed the ""un-dead"" rising from the graves and advancing towards the castle to become part of the horned king's army. BEAUTIFUL stuff--even if it doesn't make the film a great film. The film was also completely re-cut when everything was completed. While most Disney animations go through continuous change up to the end, they have never been ""completed"" and then ""re-cut."" The original version was a bit to scary for the suits at the studio. Since it's pretty much been relegated to ""ugly-step sister"" status, it's a shame they couldn't have at least released the original version. OR--at least, show the extra footage... All that said, it really is just an awful movie, with horrible dialogue, horrible animation, and horrible color."
1,Did the scriptwriter even read the original?,"The Black Cauldron is a conflation of the first two Prydain novels, and to get them together, they drop most of the interesting characters. The books were never about just Taran and Eilonwy (sp?), but also Adaon, Annlaw Clay-Shaper, and the other dozen-or-so memorable characters who drift in and out of the narrative. On top of it all, the ending is turned 180 degrees around from the original meaning -- unforgivable. At least with ""Hunchback"", there were precedents in earlier versions..."
3,Ok but not as good as you thought,This was an OK disney movie...just not as good as I thought or as I was told. It is not too dark as some would suggest...just different. Just did not GRAB my attention like I thought it would. Worth watching once in a lifetime though..I suppose...
5,I love this film to death!,"This is an amazing film. Even though it doesn't follow the books (and yes, I have read them) it's still fantastic. The movie has branched off from where the books couldn't have followed. Many of the wonderful characters from the books couldn't have been added due to animation purposes (can you imagine having 30+ characters to animate? To try to do so would have been silly). The characters are Disney-ized but in a positive way and still being faithful to the books. The animation is beautiful, using top-notch technology for it's time (first Disney film to use computer animation). The Horned King and the Cauldron Born are too scary for young childern. But with most things they see on TV today, it shouldn't scare them in the least. The PG rating is a bit harsh. Fans of the book shouldn't judge this film too harshly, everything can't be exactly like the books. It's like messing with perfection."
2,Doesn't live up to the books,"This movie completely butchered the books. I mean, they don't even include Coll, Acren, Arawn, and many others. Eilonwy is just a princess, not a princess of Llyr.If I hadn't read the books before I saw this movie, I probably would have loved it, but I did read the books. I really think people should read the books before they go blabbing about how good it is.All in all, don't buy it. It's expensive, has bad animation, nobody looks like they should, Gurgi is all cutesy, and the plot is VERY DUMB. While the books are marvelous, Disney did a cheap job on this movie. Go read the books. By now, you can probably tell that I'm trying to get something across to you:GO READ THE BOOKS!"
2,What a scray movie!,"Okay i can understand that some movies take that bappily ever after stuff out of movies like Atlantis but this was just to much. My kids didn't get scared by Atlantis and Lilo and Stich but the Black Cauldron scared them half to death. The horned King has no humour, he speaks scary and he looks like the devils son! Don't get this movie for your kids!"
1,Doesn't do the story justice,"This was a pitifully poor attempt of Disney to try to make a buck on the back of an increadible series of books. I missed the movie in the theater, so when it came out on DVD I bought it. I watched it that night and gave it away to another person in the dorms that next morning. It was awful! This could be a feature film, full length movie with human actors, or a great animated film. Disney destroyed it. Thanks to their poor efforts, many kids will never read what is probably the best kids series of books ever written."
1,Disney wrost movie.,Why bother with this wrost cartoon. There heads are not on tight. I let the MST3000 think about this movie.
5,"Finally, It is Here!!!",I love this movie!!! This special Edition is definately going to be a LOT better than its Gold Edition release. I have been after this movie ever since I had seen it. A good replacement for the VHS version. and much better. Love this movie!!!
2,"Failure of the Disney ""Formula"": When cutesy pie doesn't cut it","The pig in this movie was so cute,nobody felt sorry for the boy being a pig keeperand a major part of the pathos in theoriginal book was lost.The horned king was just not well doneor any of the witches.Even the wandering minstrel was a caricature of himself.Since much of the book was already at that caricaturelevel of folk tales and fairy tales,exaggerations to cutesy just lost theintegrity of the originalplot."
3,Whatta great movie,"The Black Cauldron is a VERY quick synopsis of the books it was based on, The Chronicles Of Prydain. The movie could have done to be a bit longer - it was edited so tight that the story beats come at you like rapid-fire. But it is still such a neato movie with all of its dark and occult imagery. I love it. BUT I would love it even more if Disney were to release a true Special Edition or even a Director's Cut. There is so much of the story and character development left out that some extra scenes would be nice. This DVD has nothing, really, that adds to the back story of the film or the filmaking process. Disappointing that this particular movie recieves so little consideration from Disney but at least it's available."
3,Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick,"Actually that probably makes it sound worse than it is.I actually liked this film. I initially purchased the DVD because I had been told that Tim Burton had worked on it. I never actually saw his name, but then again I could have missed it.It is a little darker than most disney cartoons, but I think that is one of the things I liked about it. I never actually read the book, but have been told that the movie was pretty light weight in comparison, but that happens a lot.Some of the plot is a little silly but its still a cute movie to watch. I was glad there was not a lot of singing in it as a lot times that is a put off for me.The main problem I seem to have is that there is a defect in my copy of the DVD. It freezes up consistently at the same point in the movie which forces you to stop and then chapter selct and fast forward past that part. It is the only DVD I seem to have a problem with, so it may just be the copy I got."
5,brilliant,"So it's not like the book, not by a mile. But as a disney movie this one is quite a jewel. I remember seeing it in the theaters when I was just a little kid and I was impressed, it was dark and gritty and it was everything a Disney movie wasn't. It left a mark on me that would haunt me for years to come...As years went by the movie became a vague memory that would always be there on the background. every now and then it would pop up and it made me think ""whatever did happen to that movie?""And then the moment of truth arrived, I purchased the movie and once more I was impressed. The grim drawings, the visually frightning villain and the intruiging story of the assistant pig-keeper named Taran. I never did understand why this movie was banned from the stables by Disney, it might not be what they are known for making, it's still a work of quality.No collection is complete without this movie.I only wish Disney would make more of these movies in the future.."
4,IS a lot different from most you see,"The Black Cauldron is one of Disney's Best. Sure they always leave out some of very important people and happenings but you got to give them credit for not drasticallly changing anything or changing the story line so much that no one would know that this was the story. Also they make things more realistic. Like showing a little blood, or having a boy day dream a lot, or having a girl believe she's a princess."
5,Disney is great,Disney is a good choice for family entertainment. The Black Cauldron follows that Disney tradition of quality. Good prevailing over evil is and always the right theme for any movie.
3,what happened to the two disc special edition they were promising?,"I love Disney movies, and I really am following and collecting every single classic that comes out on dvd or bluray... but they are lately being quite disappointing with their releases on dvd or bluray, since they are doing editions very poorly, above all here in Spain, but now it's happening also in all over the world. The previous trailer and teaser about the edition of the Black Cauldron was saying 2 disc special edition, and now it's gonna be only one disc... what's going on with Disney and its market?Very disappointed here..."
1,Another Disney dud,"This movie was awful. It was boring, the characters were annoying and unlikable. It's also strange and a bit scary. I rented this from Blockbuster when I was a kid, and I had to take it out and stop watching it because I found it too strange and scary. Word of the wise, don't let your kids watch this."
1,"Disney is returning to this kind of movie (alantis,)","This movie was sooooo bad it belongs with the patheon of bad disney films: The fox and the Pound, the adventures of mr. Road, aristoflats, tarzwan, dinosours. and the worst thing is that's what kind of movies disney is starting to make again, alantis, please that was one of the most boring movies, and treasure planet, they are trying to apeal to the teenage audence just like they did in the black cauldron. The only good animation is coming out of PIXAR studios.Lets face the facts the disney animators are burned out. wait 10 years and they will get there wind back.just like they did after this movie and then they will come out with some brilliant movie like beauty and the beast or aladdin"
1,"Clean the dirt out of the cauldron,please!","What are they on about? It maybe was trying to mix with Alice in Wonderland with The Legend of Zelda, but it had frog eating witches in, magic pigs, a strange little mammal thing called Girgi and it gets worse; fluffy pink fairies! Why didn't they do a different story like Tom Thumb or Jack and the Beanstalk? Go buy Alice in Wonderland or Pinocchio..."
2,A bit dark for the YOUNGER children.,"We rank this movie 35 of out of 41. It had some fun moments, but was generally a little dark for my kids. If you are looking for family entertainment there are so many other movies available that are better.This movie was based on a book, but based on some of the reviews, the older viewers that have read the book hated the movie. I didn't hate it, but it was below average, 2 star quality when compared to its peers.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty & the beast 4, Sleeping Beauty 5, Snow White 6, Robin Hood 7, 101 Dalmatians 8, Fox and the hound 9, Cinderella is 10th, Rescuers 11, Hunchback of ND 12, Aladdin 13 and Aladdin King of Thieves 14."
1,Awful Movie,"I haven't read the books though I still plan to.This movie was simply too dark for kids and to 'cute' for adults. I was scared of this movie when I was a kid and when I was in high school I thought it was lacking a real plot. Gurgie is, in my opinion, one of the worst Disney charactors of all time.But I'm a long-time believer in the adage ""Don't judge a book by it's movie."" So I'll reserve judgement."
1,deflated...disney sucked the core right out of it,"Lloyd Alexander, the author of the actual series that this movie was based on, is probably turning over in his grave because of this. He created his books for children and young adults with care and skill, making it funny, tragic, and even romantic to some extent... all the components that are found in real life, even though it was a fantasy. And to risk sounding like a fanatical hippie, the message it portrayed was deep. I suppose I should be used to disney productions screwing things up by now, but I was appalled at how they took such a wonderful story and boiled it down to such and airhead concepted ""adventure."""
4,Pretty cool,"This movie was a definite departure of the usual Disney classic with musicals and talking animals, and was derived from the book by Lloyd Alexander. That said, I think that Disney did a great job with this film, and this was done during a time where Disney was trying to find new direction and wanted to try something new, and to me, they succeeded. I'm glad that they did go back to talking animals and the like, but it was cool to see something different from them, there's nothing wrong with trying something new every once in a while."
3,"Good Animation and Story, but not representative of the Book","This DVD should really be judged on 2 levels. For those who are interested in the movie, but are unfamiliar with the Prydain Chronicles, should find this fantasy movie compelling. The animation was unique for the time, and the movie itself should be compelling for adults and mature kids. Young children might find it disturbing.Viewers who are familiar with the Prydain Chronicles and are militant about the rendering of a written story to film will probably react otherwise. The movie is more of a parrallel of the entire Prydain series than the second book in the series, the eponymous Black Cauldron, with characters and events appearing anachronistically. Viewed through this prism, The Black Cauldron will be seen as little more that Disney's debasement of a beloved story."
5,A True 80's Metal Classic !,"First of all, I'd like to apologyze about my bad english, but I hope to be understood.This is one of my favourite metal records. Powerfull, straight and honest. Not speed, thrash, black or speed metal. Just Heavy Metal. Since the first to last track. In my opinion, Kill on Sight, Holy Martyr, Teeth of the hydra and Termination are the highlights. But the other tracks also deserve to be listen to.If you are fan of bands like Manowar, Liege Lord, Savage Grace and Armored Saint you have to be this album ! You won't regret !"
2,At least 2 cats don't like this,My 2 cats don't seem to like this grooming tool. When I use it alone they squirm or run away. If I go back to the old fashioned brush and then use the glove in the other hand to do loose hair clean up then they are ok with it.
1,DONT buy this book - unless you want to know about SouthAsia,"This book is mislabelled. It should be Traditions from South Asia. The book is filled with traditions and pictures from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lank. Very little is covered about India.Please dont buy this book if you want to know about Indian Traditions.A Big ZERO Star for the book. An F- Grade for the paper."
5,Excellent documentary,"This is an exhaustive, yet highly entertaining look at the birth and growth of the home computer industry. A lot of tech history is discussed, with plenty of fascinating behind-the-scenes stories. As expected, the giants of the computer industry are interviewed (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc..), but plenty of lesser-known people are featured too. Overall a great series."
4,The ultimate history of the personal computer era.,"If you ever wanted to know how the personal computer era got its start and who where the people behind it, this is the series you want. In this three tape set you get the begining of the personal computer, how the IBM PC was created, and then the creation of the GUI (Graphical User Interface) on the Mac and eventually on the PC with Windows.Bob Cringley is an excelent presenter and has been reporting the computer industry for quite a while."
5,It's not long enough!,"What a fantastic series. I remember watching this on television years ago, and I don't think there has since been a documentary on the computing business to match it. Robert Cringely is now a regular on any show or documentary about either Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs and with good reason - he sums up the history of either with true knowledge gained from time spent with the two titans of the industry.In this amazing series, he goes back to give credit where it is dues to companies such as MITS - who invented the first home computer in the shape of the ALTAIR.For any would be entrepreneur, this series also gives the low down on how the big deals were made in Silicon valley, and a view of the hard work that made them happen.Superb viewing."
5,"Sociopaths, egomaniacs, hippies and nerds.","And we have THEM to thank for all of this.Your humble author can't help but wonder how Bob Cringely got the likes of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Paul Allen and others in front of the cameras for an honest look inside the slightly twisted minds that begat the personal computer.At 3 hours in length, ""Triumph of the Nerds"" isn't just a PBS miniseries. On home video, it becomes an epic. And why shouldn't it be? The personal computer has an impact on our lives equal to that of the light bulb and the automobile. But in the case of the PC, most of the people responsible for its creation and worldwide influence are still alive. These are flesh and blood humans, not fading historical sketches like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison.""Triumph of the Nerds"" was originally produced as a 20-year retrospective on the personal computer. But the PC will be 25 years old in the year 2000. I can't wait to see Bob Cringely's follow up"
4,Triumph of the Nerds,Documentary style. Excellent if you love history and are interested in the way the computer revolution got started.
2,Good show but both the DVD and VHS are editted,"I am in agreement with several of the reviews that indicate the DVD version is editted. Sadly, so is the used VHS copy I purchased. Maybe it was once available on VHS uneditted but not anymore. Beyond the scenes already mentioned as missing, additional scenes include more background on the Mac team and Steve Job's recruitment for the team; early discussions at Apple to make the Mac open source; and an extended scene about the ""Microserfs"". By my count there are 21 edits (large and small) which add an additional 15 to 20 minutes. I see no reason for the edits since they could easily fit on a videotape or stereo DVD. I am guessing Bob thought he improved the pacing of this program by the edits and a few are more ""politically correct."" But I am still waiting for the full version. In the meantime, I will keep my old broadcast edition."
1,Don`t buy,"this book have not very much pictures and isn`t very informative, apart of that it was very bad scratched, and I can`t tell if was in the shipping or from the buyer"
5,New Tunes,"The Comfies ""Close to me"" is for lovers of Squeeze and Guster. They combine elements of both to create an enjoyable debut album.The Comfies (formerly known as Harper) is comprised of vocalist/guitarist and principal songwriter Benjamin Adam Harper; bassist Nathan Hansen (Bang Bang Bang, The Darling Hearts, Silent Friction); drummer Sam Smith (Lifeboy, Character); and guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Raf Cevallos (The Pink Spiders, The Darling Hearts)."
2,very poor tapes,"These tapes are of low quality and not worth the money. I suggest you should go for Three Perfect Days though this is only about HK,but if you are interested in the Far East this is a good start."
3,Not bad but not the best,"This book was good but slightly predictable. I enjoy all of Roberts' books, however, this was not my favorite."
5,loved this story!!,"i started reading ""romance"" books about a year ago when a friend of mine gave me her old copy of sanctuary...i was hooked and since then, have read about 20 of nora roberts books. at this point, no other romance author interests me. each time i read a book of hers, im taken away by how involved i become in the story and characters. this book was no exception and though it is a short one (which allows me to whip right thru it) it is a great one! i absolutely love ""the macgregor"" :;smile"
3,Most Enjoyable!,"The Winning Hand by Nora Roberts is a very enjoyable read. Although, I found the novel interesting, I also found it to be quite predictable. However, I must admit it is light and easy reading that managed to keep my attention just the same.At times, a novel like this is exactly what a reader needs to relax and wind down a stressful day!"
2,Nora's the best- but not this time,"This book is probably fine for newbie Nora Roberts' fans, but anyone who has read her other category romances will find this to be same-old, same-old. It was nice to re-visit characters from the older books. I suggest hunting the original MacGregor books down, especially ""All the Possibilities""."
5,havent read it but.....,"although i havent read it yeti know its another, out of many many, great books. nora roberts does a great job and i LOVE the macgregors trilogy. i've many of them but i havent read them all and i hope roberts keeps on writing them until she has arthritis in her fingers and is forbiden to ever pick up a pencil or type on a typewriter ever again. the macgregors make me wish i had a huge family like that that is full of love laughter and every thing else. it also makes me want to get in touch with~ my scottish <not sure if its 2 ts or 1"
2,Weak and unsurprising story,"Those who are looking for a simple, ""sugary"", romantic story may fell amazed with this book. But if we analyse carefully, there is nothing in this work to distinguish it from lots of similar books with similar stories.""The Winning Hand"" is well-written, but, in my thinking, that's all. The story is linear, unsurprising, and everyone can guess the end after reading the first page..."
3,Disappointing,"I've read and reread the whole MacGregor series, and this is the first one that hasn't lived up to my expectations. It felt like there was something missing."
3,A little bewildering,"This book had so many opportunities in the script for great things. But the author seemed to take the easy way out when ever possible. I felt that the author was trying too hard in the stories climax. Some of the conclusions the hero made about the heroine were completely unrealistic. Don't get me wrong, though. The book was very entertaining the hero was very sweet. All in all I'll probably re-read the book 6 months from now when I have completely forgotten the plot."
4,"predictable, but still enjoyable","I agree with the reviewers who say that this book is predictable. Darcy, a woman who wants to be a published author and is running away from a man she doesn't want to marry, ends up in Vegas. With nearly the last of her money, she wins the jackpot on a slot machine and later ends up falling in love with the owner of the casino. It's definitely meant to be a feel-good story - nothing bad could possibly happen to Darcy. She's a very meek sort of person, and, in spite of what Darcy often says, I would agree with the hero of this book, Mac, that she is also pretty naive. However, she does develop more of a backbone as the book progresses. If you're in the mood for something sweet and not too complicated, I recommend this book."
3,Lots of fun,One of my favorite of Roberts' books written for the Harlequin brand of books. Totally enjoyable with a heroine you can root for to win.
5,Language of souls,"Language of Souls is both visually and poetically liberating to one's soul. The poetry and artwork blend together to paint contemplative pictures for the mind, taking the reader to unimagined heights, freeing the soul to soar with the artists. Magnificent!"
5,"A Facinating, Riviting Poetry Book","I heard KT and David do a Poetry Reading from their Book Language of Souls, it was done with such love and special meaning,I know that the words and poems chosen,When kt and David recited their works it made you feel as if you were reliving the experinces that they shared in there superb poems. They have such depth in the way they express themselves and beauty in the words. Just wonderful, there are not enough words I can say about these special people. Keep up the Wonderful Work God Bless Janet Russell Host and Producer Beyond The Unexplained"
4,First album by a popular Brazilian hard rock band,"Charlie Brown, Jr. ""Transpiracao Continua Prolongada"" (Virgin, 1997)This is the first album, from 1997, by the popular Brazilian ska/skate/hard rock band, Charlie Brown, Jr. It's loud, aggressive, tightly-performed music, which might appeal to fans of groups such as Linkin Park or Sublime, although this is sung in Portuguese. Worth checking out if you want a taste of how modern rock, 1990s style, played out in Brazil. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
5,An cd who you listening all of it,"This album of Charlie Brown Jr. ( the first of the band) it's an album full of a ska-rock from Brasil, very coOl, it's no band in world with the sound appears like that, you must to listening the album to know what I'm saiyng. =)"
1,Ivory Pearls,They do not even look like the picture that is stated on Amazon. They are not shiny and do not look like pearls. Dull looking and won't order ever again. I am doing wedding cupcakes and very disappointed.
3,Iraq was created to fail.,"""The borders we've given this new state (Iraq) are guaranteedto create: strife in this region, abundant opportunity for military intervention, career advancement and glory---for the next 100 years""---so quoth a youngWinston Churchill who was a minor functionary during the Sykes-Picotperiod (1915-16) who was actually citing a quote by a more senior official.Frankly, I did not know that the Turks were delighted by this treaty becausea rather wroth Kemal Attaturk had a portion of the new Turkish Constitutionspecifically tell future generation not to play the Allies' game and attemptto take back traditionally Turkish areas of Iraq with military force.Attatuk forsaw the strife to come in Iraq and positited that eventuallythe coming Civil and Religious wars in Iraq would cause Turkish areas tobeg to rejoin Turkey---no military intervention needed.The author is either a Pollyanna or a career political hack. Nation Building!?Hah."
3,Funny B movies!,"Although these two have rock bottom budgets, they are shot on film, not video. If you like ridiculous and absurd humor with a definite B movie atmosphere, these two flicks are a lot of fun. Loons is the better of the two, with the longest prologue I've ever seen, but it's quite a funny one. The cast in both films are decent actors and if you can forget about mainstream big budgets and gloss, you can really get into the them. I enjoyed them both and had some good laughs. No vulgar stuff or toilet humor, either. What a relief!"
5,Raw Black Metal,"Well I gotta go with the tradition, and start by saying that they don't sound like COF. Having said that, I'll continue on to say that this album is a kickass raw Black Metal album. It's got pretty good headbangers, so if that's how you like your Black Metal, you'll love this one. It's raw, unfurnished, and psyco. And to add the sugar on the top- it's got great traces of Hecate Enthroned's dark and gothic atmosphere which will develope in their following albums. The part in the middle of ""To Feed Upon Thy Dreams"" and in the middle/end of ""Luciferian Death Code"" make it all worthwhile- I LOVE THEM. Raw & gothic, now that's another scorcher you gotta have in your Black Metal Library."
2,SUB-STANDARD,This is an old demo pressed on to CD. So don't go looking for good productuion. The sound is raw and harsh. The main problem is that this band really wants to be CRADLE OF FILTH and comes across as a sub-standard version.
4,Experiméntalo!,Éste es un libro que no te va a dejar igual. Después de haberlo leído desearás poner en práctica sus pricipios para caminar en la voluntad de Dios. Las ilustraciones de la propia vida del autor són muy enriquecedoras!
5,I read this book myself at age 11,"My mother gave this book to me when I was 11 years old. Unfortunately, I think a more appropriate age would've been 9 or 10, before my perceptions of sex were influenced by peers. My own daughter is 8 years old, and I intend to share this book with her now. While some reviewers complain about the lack of content, as an 11 year old child I felt it provided ample information. My mother always kept an ""open door policy"" when it came to discussing sex, so additional questions I had were answered by her. That is how it should be. The book should be used as a tool to introduce sex, not a concise encyclopedia of sex and morality. I'm buying several copies, by the way, to share with my friends who also have children expressing curiosity about sex. And I hope the book is as helpful to my daughter as it was to me all those years ago."
5,This book taught me,"I read this book just before turing twelve over a decade ago. If you are a religious person and want to raise your children with good Christian valuse, this book is excelent. I am grateful that my parents used it to teach me about sex."
1,For Christians Only,"I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was so oriented toward a strict religious view of sex. I believe it is detrimental to children developing today to have so many ""forbiddens"" and to teach them that sexual orientations different from the norm are wrong. This book tries to take the parent's place and teach morals directly to the child. If you buy the book, make sure to read it before giving it to your child to read, you may find out your child is learning exactly the opposite of what you want him or her to know."
2,Way to small,I enjoyed this book in it's audio version so I had put it on my wish list. I didn't check out the size of the book. I was very surprised when I received it as a mini book.(so were the people who gave it to me) Where was all that great information? All I can say is make sure that you want a book that fits in your pocket. I suggest the regular size edition.
4,"Great book, very helpful","I thought this book was fabulous. I appreciate that as other reviewers said, Orman spends much of the book getting us to understand our ideas about money. Everyone views money differently, as a result of various experiences in our lives. It's not until we understand how we treat money, that we can change our habits about it.There is of course practical money suggestions as well. I found the section about wills/trusts/life insurance to be the most helpful. She spells out the difference between a will and a trust, in simple language that makes it easy for all readers to understand. Furthermore, while I found hints on many things to change in my outlook, I was also very heartened by the things that I am doing right!If you're looking for a book that is entirely practical information,then don't turn here first. However, I strongly encourage you to go through the psychology examples she uses here, and you will indeed be closer to financial freedom."
2,Good but...,"Suzie is great but this video is too ""skim the surface"". Her appearances on Oprah are at least as detailed, AND FREE ! Also beware, the cover may say 127 or so minutes, actually 1 hour 27 minutes.Suspect book(s) would be much better value.SM"
1,not as described,"Prompt shipping and response to email inquiry, although book was advertised as ""like new"", it arrived looking highly used, with deep folds and indentations all along the top as if it had been smashed.Bought as a gift so pretty disappointed...."
1,Sad,"The sad story of many excellent writers is that they really do not know when to quit (same case in movie stars). Books like the Dummies ..., Do not sweat the small stuff in ..., and these mental stuff all started very well. Please cook up something else or just fade away. I did not get anything out of this book except things I already knew, even though I liked the 9-steps"
1,9 Steps To Giving Suze Your Money,This woman is terrible. Try Bogle's book or Get Clark Smart: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Rich from America's Money-Saving Expert.
1,Writer has no business naming funds on tv .,"Took Ormans Advice , started with $ 21000 and lost $ 13000 in6 months. That was Holly,s College money who is a junior in high school. How can I tell her that She cant go to the University ofHuntsville AL. Thank You Suze."
1,Wretched,"Simply awful. Suze Orman is all sizzle, no steak. Don't buy the book, invest your savings and you will be better off."
3,"Not bad, But Not Great","If you've read one Suze Orman book, you've read them all. Those who are deeply in debt should certainly look elsewhere. Try also Surviving Financial Disasters, for those who are truly looking to get out debt. Also The richest man in Babylon."
4,Good View of Finances,"The 9 Steps To Financial Freedom is one of the better books I have read on personal finance. It is very informative as to how to deal with money and how people view money. If I were to read one book on personal finance, this would be it. This is a good book for people of all ages and anyone can benefit from reading it."
5,How good is this book?...,"Suze Orman gains increasing popularity, not by virtue of the fact that she appears on Oprah Winfrey's talk show, but that she writes some of the BEST financial advise around. I enjoyed the book so much that I bought copies for my *entire family* and various friends. It is a MUST READ. Seize control of your financial future, understand what value money has--and learn to manage it (and your attachment to it) in a reasonable, healthy fashion. Ms. Orman has the right approach. Don't wait for the paperback version--start reading the hardcover right now. Make a difference in your life with ""The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom."""
4,it was great,"I thought the book was really well written and personable. It read really smoothly and was very informative. You walk away saying, wow, so that's how you do that or I was doing it all wrong. It really helped me get on track."
3,the 9 steps to financial freedom - suze orman,"suze orman is excellent, although this book includes many usa based industries and regulations, we can all pick up something from this book and adapt it to our lifestyle. Thanks suze for enlisting confidence in all of us through your lateral and organised thinking."
2,didnt know it was mini,"I love suze, but i didnt know this book was 2 inches big. It is a litlle tiny pocket sized book, for a person of very small pockets:) I didnt realize how miniature, minature edition was."
5,Great Financial Advice!!,"Having just gone thru a divorce, Suze Orman gives you the financial down-to-earth motivation you need to move on. Her heart-felt honest advice gives you that feeling that you CAN and WILL be able to handle your money no matter how it is affecting your life."
5,Invaluable,"I wish that I had had this book twenty years ago. I realized that I have never learned anything about money other than how to stress over it. It is not part of the American education to teach how money works, where it comes from, how to manage it and how to be comfortable with it. Suze Orman gives us all of this in an easy to read, informative book It appeals to the intellectual as well as the spiritual aspects of how to attract money and let it grow.I am already making changes in my life as a result of reading this book and I am sharing copies with everyone I know, especially my friends in their twenties. Read it. It may change your life"
3,This was exactly what I needed; maybe not what you need,"This book laid out the basics for someone who had to start from square one-half. I had no expectations and was pleased with what I found.The Good:1. I have found the idea of looking into your past/emotions about money to be useful.2. Nowhere else have I found such clear explanations of so much investment lingo. I feel like I will be able to understand Businessweek much better now.The Bad:1. I can see how high expectations could lead to disappointment; the claims of psycho-babble are not altogether wrong.2. I think Suze Orman does not appreciate how good she is with money; most of us should probably not invest by instinct, the way she says we should.Verdict:Excellent reference for rock bottom beginner wondering where to go next, but don't believe everything you read."
1,"If I could give it a zero star, I would!","If there is one lesson I've learned in life, it's that people create a lot of hype about things which are in reality, rather mundane. This is a case in point. My Mother bought this book as a present for me after seeing Ms. Orman on the Oprah show. I searched and searched every chapter for sound financial advice -- I never found it. This book focuses on alot of spiritual nonesense, but forgets about the practical aspect of financial freedom. Don't waste your money. If you want financial freedom get the book: How to get out of debt, stay out of debt and live prosperously by Jerrold Mundis. THAT will be a sound investment!"
1,"This is not the full book, it's a mini book.",The advertising on this book is bad. This is the mini-book. Buy the full version.
2,"Some useful info, but you have to dig for it","This book reads like a self-help book written by someone who has spent years in therapy. It contains some useful information about hidden costs of living that I was unaware of before. There is also some useful advice about trusts, life insurance, and other forms of financial protection.I don't regret reading it, but I would have preferred something less ""therapeutic"". In the future I will avoid purchasing financial titles with a ""spiritual"" twist."
3,good for older readers,"this book was helpful in assisting my parents in planning their estate. however, for an under 30 reader, like myself, book was not as useful. tips are good GENERAL guidelines. for professionals who don't plan to remain at the same job for an extended period of time, maxing 401K contributions may not be the best answer. book did not give much insight into other types of investments, esp. real estate, or other more aggessive measures."
2,A very strange book,"I don't think that going into a darkened room and placing a hand on your tummy is something that most financial advisors would consider a worthwhile step. But this new-age Suze is full of claptrap like this -- diving for childhood memories of money, reliving them, and forging ahead to create new ""furrows in the brain.""In the meantime, she seems to favor loading yourself up with insurance to the hilt, and buying mutual funds. <Gasp>.What astonishing advice!!(She is also against credit-card debt. Gasp!)THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE. I NOW BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE EARNING $45,000 PER YEAR SHOULD NOT HAVE $75,000 IN CREDIT-CARD DEBT. I FULLY UNDERSTOOD THIS IN THE DARKENED ROOM WITH MY HANDIE ON MY TUMMIE."
1,Strange religion with financial planning,"Suzy should stick to just financial planning. She should not try to be a preacher nor a psychologist. Here's a sample of her junk, ""Analyze the fears within you. Write down your earliest dealings with money and you will see why you are the way you are..."" ""To get money, you must first part with it, then money will find you"" ""Money has a power, if you don't respect it, it won't respect you"" Come on!!! I give this book 4 stars for the solid financial planning. I learned about trusts, wills, insurance, index mutual funds and no loads, saving for the 401K. Unfortunately, I give it negative (-3) stars for the eastern religious themes and general bizare moral relativism."
1,The 9 Steps to financial freedom,"I found this small, hand held, version with nothing profound. Simple common sense"
1,BEWARE,The book I purchased was about 4 inches tall! Labeled as a hardcover (it is). Read the fine print before you order.
5,The Best book on this subject EVER!,"Throughout the process of reading this book, I kept telling my friends all about the tips that I was learning. They were looking forward for me to sit down with them as much as I was! This book definately covers the basics and much, much more! I first heard about this book in a seminar where they were demonstrating goal oriented software like Neurosync and this book kept coming up. I have read, read and read more books on the subject of debt and personal finance. Ms. Orman's book is one of the best that I've read over the last 3 years. I especially liked the tips on the first time investor and where to start. This book will definately open your eyes and heart to becoming a more responsible human being for your family. My family is going to be on the right path with this book as our road map."
4,A book everyone needs,"Written in plain and simple words, this book can help change your life for the better. It did mine!"
5,Anyone who cares about their future should read this book.,"After seeing one of the the shows that Suze did about her book, I ran out and got it. She has a special way of talking to people and reaching people. I felt inspired after reading her book. It has helped my life and my future. I have now bought the book for my family and friends. Thanks Suze!"
4,BUY THIS BOOK!,"Straight forward & down to earth. It didn't teach me everything I need to know about personal finances but it did give me a great overview and motivate me to read more on the topic.It also motivated me to take immediate action on the things I could change. Like increasing my 401K deduction, getting more involved with my investments - however small they may be, listening to myself about what feels right, & treating my money with respect to attract more.Not my usual idea of a fun read - but it was truly painless : ) ENJOY!"
1,2% good advice wrapped up in 98% of absolute rubbish,"I wanted to like this, and there is some good 101 style advice in there about lump sum versus slower investing and trusts versus wills but this is basic info - the rest is baby boomer rubbish about ""attracting money"" with your beliefs, treating money as a ""cherished friend"" etc. She says it makes you ""powerless"" to help people out financially, that you should not help your kids pay bills, and that the only ""powerful"" way to give away money is to give it to your parents because you owe them for having you, and to give your money to a charity or church. So baby boomers if your gen x kids are swimming in debt from student loans hand more money to charities and places of worship and don't ""lose power"" by helping your kids. There is nothing in here for people under 40 and/or those struggling to start out in life under a mountain of student loan debt. Pass this one by.I strongly recommend ""Pat The Money"" as the antidote to this book."
3,Australian readers better to look closer to home,"While this title has some good stuff to say about our attitudes/ behaviour regarding money Australian readers would be better off investigating the work of David Koch, Noel Whittaker and Paul Clitheroe. Much of Ms. Orman's advice is US-specific -which is great if that's where you're based. If not, look elsewhere."
5,The book is practical and spiritual,At the begin of the book it amazes me how Suze Orman used people past problem to sort out our financial problems.
1,Suzie Orman should be drawing welfare checks....,I just cannot believe that people have been encouraging this jezebel of the financial world to spout her baseless jargon to the public. Her ideas for personal success make about as much sense as playing leap frog on a picket fence. Don't waste your time or money--that's the first step to financial freedom.
2,Be careful what you buy!!,"This is not a book, not a real one anyways. This is just a sypnosis of the real thing. It fits in the palm of my hand!!"
1,Utterly Ridiculous!!,And the writing is juvenile. If there's anything to reincarnation Suze ought to be worried after bilking money from so many people.
5,Nine Steps to Financial Freedom,"This is one of the most helpful books I have ever read. I checked it out of the public library over and over again, I enjoyed it so much. I took notes and put the advice to good use. I recommend it to everyone, just like anyone would, once they have read it thoroughly themselves. I am currently getting out of debt through one of your ways you recommended in the book and if it would not have been for you, Suze, I would never have thought of going about it in this way. Thank you for being so helpful. Now I would like to own my own book instead of going to the public library to read it."
3,Advice is not revolutionary but good definitions,"It turns out I had taken most of the steps Suze outlines in this book several years ago so I can't say I found out anything earth shaking.However, her definitions of all the financial terms were well worth the read. Many questions are left unsaid when you get caught up in signing trusts and other papers so I enjoyed the detail she goes into. I can feel better about what I've done not just because she has it in the book but because many things are a bit clearer now.This is not a ""get rich quick"" book! It is more of an ""understand your money"" book so look elsewhere if you think you want to be retired six months after taking her advice. If you are one of those people who just blindly contributes each month to a 401K or has signed a lot of papers and are not sure what they are, this book is worthwhile. Or if you are a young newlywed just starting out, get a hold of this to understand that savings should start the day after the honeymoon!"
3,Taken by surprise,"This little book was a surprise to me. While there is merit to having a handy little reference, I would have wanted to know this BEFORE I purchased it. I was under the impression I was ordering a regular edition. I felt like I had been had. I have read the regular book and wanted a copy for my own collection. Ms. Orman gave me unusual insight into my feelings about money and this encouraged me to face my unrealized emotions and start taking charge of my money in a more rational way. I've re-examined the internet ad for this little book and still find it to be ambiguous. Life goes on ... but not getting what one bargains on is always disappointing."
1,Waste of paper,"I saw Suze Orman on CNBC in january 2001 screaming ""buy the QQQ's"" (a nasdaq-100 tracking stock) its down 50% in 3 months. This is the worst advice and the book is the same. I would have given zero stars but 1 is the lowest."
5,GREAT BOOK-GREAT PRICE,"DELIVERY IN SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, GREAT BOOK WORTH EVERY PENNY. I WAS ABLE TO SPEND LESS BY BUYING ONLINE."
2,Probably good for AMericans,"The first half of the book was good general information, but the second part really applied to Americans only and was a waste of money for me. Maybe a book a quarter of it size with more general tips would be good for international sale."
1,Great book for pinheads!,"Use the money you would pay for this book and invest it. Better books: ""One Up on Wallstreet"" - Peter Lynch, ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" - Burton Malkiel, ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" - Andrew Tobias. Check them out from the library. She is selling common sense like it is quantum mechanics."
1,Basically Common Sense...,"I bought this book with the idea of recieving some earth shattering guidance for improving my financial status. Wrong. Basically, it's a bunch of common sense ideas like, ""Don't charge on your credit cards anymore if you want to pay them off."" Brilliant ! My advice: Just use common sense and you will save money. You don't need a book to give you common sense !"
4,"Stop Worrying, Do Something","I bought this book mostly to review and compare our financial decision making process.We liked the clearly explained concepts and suggestions in this book so much that I've just ordered four additional copies to give to our son, nieces and nephew (young adults).I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a reference and update financial family affairs."
2,"More Dr. Phil Than ""The Wealthy Barber""","I really thought the 9 steps were going to be financial steps, but they aren't--most of them are psychological steps to being more ""respectful"" towards your money. That's fine and good, but some of us need to know more about the different kinds of IRAs than what childhood event formed out personal attitude towards money.This book is helpful for people who have issues with money, not really so for people who just want to know how to invest it better. Should be sold as Self-Help, not Finance."
3,Better Yet,"Suze Orzman has a few valuable lessons to teach, but sends mixed messages. I found a much more readable, deeper, healthier, and consistent approach in The Mindful Money Guide. The author of The Mindful Money Guide is a former stockbroker who retired at a young age and then spent the next 15 years honing the art and balance of managing money--so it doesn't manage you. The Mindful Money Guide shows you how to simplify your money life, but it doesn't pretend there are easy answers. Despite the serious sounding title, it's actually a fun read."
1,Why pay for info when you can get it for free?,"I made the mistake of buying this book and later found the same information on Fidelity's website under the investment planning section. You'll also want to check out wealth management resources. Try Morningstar's website. From there you can find more financial info than Suze Orman provided in her book, and you won't have to muddle your way through the therapy sessions that she includes in her book."
3,College Student....,"read the book...liked it....but unfortunetly is was aimed more towards the middle aged consumer...Found the information in this book very redundant.... Most of which was taught in my Finance classes last year.... But for those in their fifties and forties who may not be ""financially saavy"" i feel this book would be very beneficial to them...."
4,Outdated but most things still apply,"I'm finding out that by reading some of Suze's books, they might be a little outdated. However, the basic principles apply. You need to do something to set yourself free from the financial burden and this is a great book to start with."
4,A GREAT BEGINNING GUIDE,"The ideal book on money if you're not certain what to do. It will get you up and running, feeling that you can take charge of your financial life. It can and will change your life. Then you should read one of the more concrete and practical books on what to do with your money. I recommend ""The Dun & Bradstreet Guide to Your Investments."" It tells you exactly what to do with your savings, retirement accounts, brokerage account, mutual funds; and it is written for men as well as women. It, too, is a winner."
5,A worthwhile book for everyone,"After reading this book, I have a much better understanding about money. I had a lot of questions answered and it gives me hope and belief that no matter how much you make, you can reach your realistic goal by saving, investing and it gives you the knowledge of how to protect your money. If I had read this book since I turned 25, I would have been in a much better shape financially, but it's never too late for anyone!"
2,Have I seen this before?,"This book is pretty good in itself, but if you already own one book by Suze Orman, you don't need to buy another. Her productivity when it comes to getting books on the market is amazing, but the contents are disappointingly alike from book to book."
4,Committed to saving,"I have always hated owing anyone money for any reason so I have always been great about paying bills but I have never been very committed to saving. I wish I had read this book before I was laid off because it showed me the importance of saving and how to do so, even if you feel like you can't afford to. The truth is that you can't afford not to save for your future!"
2,Ouch!,"I am just beginning to read this book. I just opened it and began reading the first tutorial. It wants me to import a file into my flash 5 project from the CD-ROM that comes with the book. I look into the contents of the CD...nothing! The file ""forest.gif"" isn't even on the CD! Just by the looks of it, it doesn't look like this book will be very good. I mean, I just now started it! To me, this is embarrasing to the authors. Be careful what you buy folks..."
3,The End of the Trail,"This book wasn't the best Hardy Boys book but the plot was good. If you are a Hardy Boys fan,and looking for another Hardy Boys book to read, read this one. All in all it was an okay book. I liked this book because it had some surprises,and like I said there was a good plot."
3,Con law class main textbook,it was a required for a class i took. i still keep it to re-read certain cases. good brief summation of opinions and decisions.
2,Review,"The item took longer to receive than anticipated. It also arrived in only fair condition, not as rated as ""good"". Pages missing and falling out. Not as expected. Return policy was difficult to locate."
2,Soft shape is not ideal,"I liked the look of this case from the photo, but upon receipt decided it wouldn't provide enough protection. Although the contour back is firm, the rest of the case is quite flexible and thinly-padded. With the weight of the laptop inside, when using the shoulder strap, the entire case hangs a little crooked and misshapen. Papers kept inside with the laptop could easily get crumpled and bent up too. I was not impressed with the overall design and protection features and returned it."
3,"Humble, yet fun","I am not an expert, when it comes to literature, but my opinion about the book is as follows. The book offers some great stories with describtions so detailed that one can believe the stories are all true. SOme of them are very moving, some of them very shallow, but they are all great stories. The reason I gave the book 3 stars out of 5 is, that the stories are not connected. The only thing they have in common is that they happen in the same cities. After reading the book, the pieces of the book are still left shattered. I recommend reading the book chapter by chapter."
5,Perfect for Honda VTX1300,"This Vance & Hines Cruzers exhaust is a perfect fit on my 2007 Honda VTX1300, looks exactly like the photo on Amazon. It arrived quickly and was easy to install using the directions provided. It probably took us (husband and wife team) about an hour or a little less. We didn't need any special tools or extra parts, which was a relief.It looks great and sounds amazing, much louder than our Harley! Totally changed the way the bike sounds coming down the street, and can be heard for a couple of blocks."
1,"A Politics Oriented ""Academic"" Fact Finder","The book is supposed to be an academic objective fact list, but unfortunately it involves lots of political considerations regarding to the decisions about which facts to include. For example, Israel is ommited from many country lists (e.g. from the academic institution list - there is no Israely university over there!), and many African (French-oriented) countries. It's a pitty to find a book coming from Cambridge so politics oriented. This is not a real academic fact finder! - Grahm K.R. Schneider"
4,A must-read for anyone interested in learning more about the place of the Virgin Mary in Christianity,"A truly excellent introduction to the place of the Virgin Mary in the Christian Faith and the various ways she has been seen throughout history. Perhaps the most interesting parts of the book were those in which Pelikan shows how undermining the doctrines regarding Mary, such as her place as ""Theotokos,"" essentially undermines the doctrines of Christ. I recommend this book for those who are looking for a better understanding of the place of the Blessed Virgin in the Christian Faith and why she is more than deserving of that place."
5,00march on metal warriors,by far the best omen release.each track has so much power true animal metal.from the title track to make me your king just total power i played the album till it sounded like pop korn a most fan if you are into the 80s metal
5,A Lesson in History,"Path to War is a fine movie. It shows the gradual steps that rationalized America's increased involvement in an undesirable war. This is not an action movie; however, it is a very important study on how well-intentioned presidents lose control while wielding control. And, of course, they are then left to face the consequences of their weighty decisions while the former manipulative politicians bail for cover.This movie deals with the decisions made by Lyndon B Johnson as he listened to his advisors and tried unsuccessfully to avert greater involvement in Viet Nam. It will help you appreciate why he made the announcement that he would not accept nor seek another term as president.Many lives were ruined by the decisions and influence of the men portrayed in this movie. War is never waged in a straight line.I think it is an invaluable addition to any DVD collection on war."
4,Sleepwalking into a War,"I think this mini series shows that Johnson Administration, the U.S.A and her allies e.g. Australia had the best intentions when they went to war in Vietnam, but things rapidly got out of control and you can't fight an insurgency from 30,000 feet. I think the United States thought the Vietnam War would be over in six months and that if you dropped enough bombs, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese would give up. This mini series show what a slippery slope the Vietnam War was and how it quickly became a quagmire."
2,Disappointing compared to other historical dramas,"This film didn't flow smoothly or capture the feeling and/or spirit of the Vietnam era. More like another ""W"" but different president."
3,Path to War,An account of the Vietnam War build up under President Johnson. Covers the time period from taking the oath of office until his decision not to run for reelection in 1968.
3,history,It was okay only because I lived through that time.The material that was covered was not surprising.People who are looking for history in the 60's would find this an eye opener.
3,LBJ,"I was told as a history student to watch this movie but as a historian, it is not really an excellent source to understand that war but ok to watch."
4,The background is sometimes as interesting as the event.,"How the countries and the world edge into the chaos of war. Still painful, still in light of present history very timely."
3,Could be better,"I purchased three of these headsets to go along with two others that we already had (one set was original to the Town & Country minivan and the other set was made by Audiovox). I like the overall quality of the headsets ok, but the thing that I like about Audiovox that this set lacks is an automatic shut off. We have replaced the batteries in all three sets already, but still haven't replaced them in the audiovox set (purchased around the same time). It is a bit irritating. I think the money I saved by buying this cheaper set is going to go towards batteries! The earpads are well cushioned and can snap off if flexed too far (I thought they had been broken at first), so that was a relief. The plastic casing is very thin and I'm afraid won't hold up all that well, but we'll see. Overall, they are a nice set if you aren't going to be using them all the time. If they are going to get frequent use I would opt for a better quality set (with an auto shut-off)."
3,Inexpensive but not very durable,"I purchased one set of headphones to replace one of two that were part of a more expensive set.At only $20 or so, this is a steal, but you get what you pay for. Reception is not as good, sound quality is not the best and those little pads continually fell off the ear piece. Ultimately, one of the sides came loose - I don't know how to explain it - and my husband glued it together.Keep in mind my children are 7 yrs. old and 3 yrs. old - if you have older children this is probably a great deal!"
3,Good deal,I purchased as an add on for our 2006 Town and Country Mini Van Factory DVD system. They seem to work well. They also seem to fit my young children (3 and 5) better than the factory supplied headsets. I'm satisfied with the purchase.
2,Not as good as the original...,"I'm one of the lucky few to own a copy of the original Theta cd release of ""Zoo Of Tranquility"" that was deleted long ago.At the time I was amazed at how far ahead of it's time it was; the use of innovative sampling techniques and Schmoelling's always wonderful melodies was inspired. It seemed a great leap forward from both Schmoelling's work with TD, but also from his (also excellent) first solo effort; ""Wiuvend Riet"".Consequently I was not as eager to buy this re-release as some who had been unable to find the original, but being something of a completist regarding TD and the solo work of the members, I decided I had to have it.What a disappointment! Gone are the curious sounds that made tracks like ""The Anteater"" quirky and amusing, replaced by acoustic piano; heresy to a synth purist like myself! And where has the tempo gone?I think a re-re-release of the original mix is in order..."
3,Not one of Julie`s best,"This album was a must have because of the cover and because it fills a gap in my Julie London collection. Unfortunately, I think it was a bad idea to use such dull songs, but Julie and her musicians do their best despite the dumb material."
5,"claustrophobic, brooding, excellent hardcore","Japanese Envy strikes gold with their third full-length release. Singer/screamer Tetsuya Fukagawa uses his voice like he's got the devil himself chasing him, and mirrors the complex but yet subtle hardcore guitarwalls a la Mogwai and Slint.Please discover."
4,Excellent introduction to this long-running band,"To be honest, I'd never heard Envy before seeing them in New York City back in January, but after I heard their unique fusion of hardcore and post-rock, I was hooked. They really have their own, unique brand of hardcore, featuring moderate to slow paced riffing (almost Isis-like at parts) crushing you with a huge wall of sound, then slower, softer parts, accented by malleted drums and gentler keyboards. They've forged their own path throughout the jungle that is emotional heavy music, and hopefully will continue to do this in the future."
1,Horribly written book.,This book is horrible if you do not have the basic understanding of finance or excel. The usual book will have multiple examples throughout the book of each concept that is being discussed. This is not what occurs in Financial Analysis 4e. What I need to know should be in the book and isn't. It forces one to use alternate sites to attain the knowledge that is lacking in the book.
4,Comfortable and cute!,Bought these while they were on sale and they were a great buy plus they're a very comfortable shoe. I wear them with jeans or capris and get lots of compliments on them. Would highly recommend.
2,"The arrogance of Michael Colgan, Artistic Director.","These DVDs have no subtitles in English for the deaf and hearing-impaired. Also the many dialects and accents of the Irish and English actors are at times incomprehensible to the average speaker of American English. There are no subtitles in any other language either. The producers spent US$9,000,000 on this project but not one penny on making these plays accessible. Such arrogance!"
3,Heavy-handed parable with a twist,"The story begins in a familiar folk-tale format but transmutes into a parable that tries to walk the edge between a children's fairy tale and an adult allegory, and it doesn't really succeed at being either. The political and racial proselytizing in particular got a bit heavy, especially for a fairy tale, and would have been better handled more tangentially. Though supposedly aimed at young children, it is more suited to the late elementary crowd--and it is a light, quick read for anyone who likes foxes. The overtly fantastic elements introduced in the latter half bothered me a little, but once I accepted the turn the writing had taken, I was able to get used to it.The ending, however, made up for any faults encountered on the journey. It was a satisfying conclusion, and I have to say that I did not see it coming."
2,A bit wordy,"My 3rd grader was pretty bored with this book. It was dragging on for too long. then would get to an intereting part, and become dragged on again for the next few pages."
1,Wind deflector without the magiclips.,"I got the defelector without the magiclip and I can't install it on the vehicle and I have no way to contact Amazon, wont give you any option than return the product. this is very silly."
1,Thank God for Guns!,"Thank God for Guns! If they did not have the guns to shoot each other with, this movie might have been longer. Horrible camera work, bad acting, and cheesy gore make it hard to watch. I think they are better of as zombies!"
3,Good classic B-horror,This is a classic low budget B-movie but I liked it. The acting and script were decent and kept me interested. I would recommend watching this if you like classic B-movie zombie horror.
5,well-made and lots of fun,"This film about Hefner's Playboy Mansion is great fun if you fantasize about being the ruler of that famous place. This is actually quite a sedate, documentary-type look at the overall life at the mansion, showing not only scenes of the ladies and fun parties there, but also an extensive amount about the various parts of the home, the business activities of the company, the history of Playboy, many comments from relevant people, and the like. While it's true that there is not an extensive amount on the ladies here, there are a lot more of them on this film than on A & E's edited broadcast. That's all I've noticed cut from the A & E version, though. For more of the ladies at the mansion, you might try the videosPlayboy - Mansion Parties Totally UncensoredandPlayboy - Mansion Parties, Hottest Moments & Body PaintingThis is well worth buying if you're interested in Hugh and his home."
1,"Why would tomatoe cages cost a 1,000.00. How crazy.",Someone needs a reality check on one in their right mind would pay this for cages. Looks like someone is looking to get rich not really sell something. This is rediculus.
2,"One time, only","Not one night, just view it once, then move on. Another of the long line of indie ""gay interest"" films that homosexuals will add to their ""viewed it"" list. As one tv character mused, ""despite poor films, it is your duty to view and support gay cinema."" Here is an example.Luckily, there will not be a similar production for another 20 or so years.I would add this dvd to my shelf holding ""U-Turn"", ""Truth or Consequences"" and ""Kalifornia"" only because it includes talented Keith David--""johns"", ""Men at Work"", ""Spawn"" and numerous other titles [see IMDB and the fan forum accalades]."
1,leaves lint,"I'm disappointed with this cleaning cloth. Everytime I rub my sunglasses, it leaves lint all over. It's not soft either, Don't buy!"
2,slippery fabric,These cloths were not what I expected. I was hoping for a little more fiber than micro..I wouldn't purchase these again.
4,Worked well,"I used this to clean my Anti Reflective coating eye glasses, it works very well, and leaves the eye glasses as clean as you are going to get them.However, it's not perfect so I would definitely pick up some sort of wipes for eye glasses to go along with it."
4,Nice cloth,Always could use an extra cloth for glasses and cleaning iPhone screens as well as tablets. Cleans all these very well.
3,Less smudging than other cleaning cloths,"At first, I was always able to clean my eye glasses with this cloth without any smudges being left behind by rubbing the glasses only a couple times. However, after washing it 6-7 times in the washing machine, I've noticed that it takes a lot more wipes with the cloth to get the smudges off. Despite that, this is probably the best cleaning cloth for glasses that I've come across, so I'd still recommend it."
2,Something is Wrong With It,"I bought several of these to clean my glasses and shiny electronics such as my cell phone and computer. They are not as soft as what you would get at an optical or glasses shop - they have a very finished feel to them, more like polyester, less like silk. I think they may have even put slight scratches on my cell phone. Tried two different clothes. Unfortunately, not recommended, even though the company was very helpful and shipped fast."
4,decent cloth for the price,"For the price, this is a decent cleaning cloth for my glasses. It is not as soft as I would have expected for a microfiber cloth. Overall it performs as expected for the price."
1,Microfiber Lens Cleaning Cloth By Apex Healthcare Products,no puedo realisar una opinion de este articulo ya que fue el unico que no resivi de la compra que realise ese dia
3,"It does what it's supposed to..nothing more, nothing less","It's priced right at $.79, but I doubt it costs $2 to ""ship"" it via an envelope in the regular mail. All in all, it does clean well. I use it with glass cleaner for my Maui Jim sunglasses, as well as my Rx glasses, and it does a great job. What is it with micro-fiber cloths, though? Why is it so hard to find a LARGE cloth at a decent price? This is one of the largest I have found under 5 bucks, but could really stand to be bigger..."
4,"Works well, low price, a bit thick.","Tried another similarly-priced brand first, they smudged. Ordered this brand, works great. These are thicker than any cloths I've used before, but no big deal."
5,Best Lens Cleaning Cloth I have Ever tried,"This lens cleaning cloth is great. It is the best I have ever tried. You still need to get the junk off the lens first, preferably with an alcohol wipe. Then you use this cloth by breathing on the lens and wiping off the little spots that are left. It works very well! Each one lasts me about 3 months, then it needs to be replaced because the smudge stuff will slowly build up on the cloth, but that happens with all clothes in my experience."
5,Awesome for sunglasses,"I bought the cloth to clean my Oakley sunglasses which I am paranoid as hell about scratching. I have used many cloths that don't work all that well and that I would never trusted to clean my sunglasses. Until now I have only trusted Oakley's own cleaning cloths. The cloth has a very fine, almost silky feel to it that works great and doesn't pick up dirt or anything large that would cause the lenses to get scratched. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
4,nice sized,"This is a nice sized microfiber cloth. Case is a little cheap, but I didn't buy it for the case. Washable, good size and soft as a baby's bottom. Cost almost as much as the shipping, so make sure you add this one on when you're ordering something else!"
5,Outstanding product,"This works great for cleaning my glasses, which always had difficult smudges, probably due to the AR coating. It comes with a sleeve that is very handy and keeps it from getting dirty/lost/unfolded in my briefcase. I will definitely order another (or two!) when this one wears out or gets lost."
1,Awful.,"The promo sheet for this calls these guys ""The Japanese Beatles."" Boy, are they wrong. Hi-Standard, for those who don't know, are a Japanese punk trio, who, more or less, sound like the majority of the Fat catalog: Medium-fast tempo, boring lyrics, semi-melodic, and extremely bland and generic. For some reason, these guys are huge in Japan, and over 400,000 copies of this CD have sold there. What a waste of plastic. I guess if you're addicted to Fat nad you feel like you have to own everything they put out, regardless of quality, this record is for you. For the rest of the public who DON'T always buy an album based on the label it's on, skip this and save your money for the new Consumed album."
5,hi-standard rocks,Hi-Standard is an awesome Japanese punk band and I think this cd is totally catchy and anyone who likes poppy punk should own this.
2,Is this the Angry Fist cd?,"I finally bought Making the Road,after giving good praise on their ""Angry Fist""release years ago. If I am correct this the songs of this release sound almost identical to those on""Angry Fist"". Lack of innovation. I have listened to this twice already and I am not pleased with this release."
5,A Unexpected Treasure,"Just finished reading ""Letters to Malcolm"" by C.S. Lewis. It is generally considered to be one of Lewis's lesser works, but I would rate it as one of his best (chapter 21 may be one of the best things on prayer I have ever read). This intensely personal book was published after Lewis died in 1963 and is well worth your time if you get a chance to read it."
5,An Excellent Addition to the Library,"This book has moved to the ""favorites"" section of my Lewis books. His letters are informal and easy to read. Despite being written decades ago, they remain thouroughly relevent to today's issues."
3,Meditations on prayer life,"Letters to Malcolm was the last book that C.S. Lewis wrote, and consists of twenty two letters written to a fictitious character named Malcolm, mostly concerning Lewis's thoughts about prayer. This may be the most personal glimpse of Lewis's spiritual side, and many have enjoyed his relaxed, warm dialogue in these epistles. For those wishing to meditate on the various aspects of praying (content of prayer, petitionary prayers - does God grant requests?, prayer as worship, penitential prayer, the Lord's prayer, or prayer for the dead) this book will give plenty of food for thought. Personally, I like most of Lewis's other books better than this one, but if you are studying the subject of prayer, pondering worship in prayer, or musing about whether or not praying does any good, this book will be a good purchase for you."
4,'Tape' = Linklater at his Best,"If there could be a number eleven on my top ten films of 2001, this would be it. This claustrophobic film, based on Stphen Belbar's Off-Broadway play, features dynamite acting, icluding Gen-X actor and recent Oscar nominee Ethan Hawke's best performance EVER!Set in a hotel room, 'Tape' revolves around three high school friends(Mr. Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Robert Sean Leonard) who come togther once again ten years after graduating from school and saying goodbye to each other.The film heats up when an accusation is made: A drug dealer(Hawke) blames his best friend(Leonard)of raping his high school girlfriend and the love of his life(Thurman). You'll have to find out if it is true or not by watching, because my lips are sealed.Performances like Mr. Hawke's make you wonder if he got his Oscar nod for the wrong movie. Plus, this film has a killer ending. So get off your ass, go to Borders.com, and order 'Tape' today! -James R. Louison"
3,A Reunion of Sorts,"It's not easy to make a film work when the whole thing takes place in a single room, but Linklater and Hawke make it happen in TAPE. It's the story of two old high school buddies who meet up in a hotel room and discuss their friendship and then their rivalry. Ethan Hawke is still angry that Robert Sean Leonard made some whoopee with Hawke's high school girlfriend, Uma Thurman and Hawke wants Leonard to admit that it was rape. They go so far as to invite Thurman to the hotel room and discuss it with her. Did he or didn't he?Director Richard Linklater handles the material well, it was based on a stage play, and the actors hold their own. Hawke and Leonard, you'll remember were roommates in Dead Poet's Society and Thurman is married to the Hawke, so it is quite a labor of love among friends. I enjoyed the film all the way through but it isn't something I am likely to watch again. A nice one-time event."
4,"Essentially a Taped Play, But a Good One","Richard Linklater does more with just three characters in one set that most filmmakers do with so much more. In TAPE he has crafted an often engaging story of three school friends who meet in a seedy motel room. The piece never gets past its obvious stage origins, but Linklater manages quite admirally to keep the dramatic tension up throughout the piece.Shot on tape, the project has a very cheesy look which makes it seem almost like a surveillance tape. Along with the intensity and rawness of the performances, you feel like you're eavesdropping. While not slick by any means, TAPE is a very engaging work. If you want to see something smart with a bit of an edge, check out TAPE."
3,Pretentious,This film is over-rated at 4 stars. It starts off slow and eventually gets to something that is interesting. But it's very pretentious and not very believable.
5,Messes with your mind,"Excellent, intelligent script, believable performances by 3 great actors, and a super interesting plot for anyone into in complicated relationships and what makes people tick. Deeply gripping and messes with your mind. I've seen this film 4 times and it still puzzles me."
3,"Pretty talky, no action","Don't view this expected much action. There is none, really. The entire film takes place inside a claustrophic cheesy motel room where Ethan Hawke and a high school buddy engage in a monologue about events that seem to still haunt them 10 years after they graduated. Uma Thurman provides a bit of relief from the tedium about half way through. This is a stage play adapted for the screen, so, as usual, it's all about the dialogue, and the dialogue is pretty good. Not a profound film, but worth a watch if you are in a certain mood."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Drawing its strength from a performance by Ethan Hawke that's so good it forever made me like him as an actor when I previously hated him, Tape is an ingeniously claustrophobic drama from Richard Linklater."
1,Why?,"What can I say, this is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Are you people insane? Great change of atmosphere? They were in the same damn room the whole time. Amazing and realistic dialog? Who talks like this? No one, absolutely no one. Why, how, what..that's the whole script. Why indeed."
1,WHAT A BORE,THIS MOVIE WAS A SUPREME WASTE OF MY TIME WITH A VERY DISJOINTED PLOT WHICH I BECAME VERY WEARY OF TRYING TO DECIPHER. NEARLY THE ENTIRE MOVIE TAKES PLACE IN A HOTEL ROOM WITH LENGTHY MONOLOGUES. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
2,LEFT WONDERING,"BEING AN AVID HORROR FAN I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE NOT EXPECTING TOO MUCH AND IGOT WHAT I EXPECTED. CASPER VAN DIEN SEEMED UNABLE TO SHOW MUCH INTEREST INHIS ROLE BUT, HE WAS NOT ALONE. I GAVE THE MOVIE TWO STARS BECAUSE OF THETWO OUTSTANDING CHARACTER ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE, TONY PLANA, AND DANNY TREJOWHO ARE ALWAYS WORTH WATCHING EVEN IN A PLASTIC MOVIE LIKE THIS. SAVE YOURMONEY THERE ARE A LOT BETTER B GRADE MOVIES OUT THERE. I'M LEFT WONDERINGHOW THIS ONE GOT RELEASED."
2,SOMEWHAT BLOODY MESS,"SLAYER is another one of those SCIFI CHANNEL's made for tv movies that's not really awful but offers nothing spectacular either. Notice how vampires in the new millennium can run around in the daylight, don't mind crosses and have also become cannibalistic..a nip in the neck isn't enough. This time the vampires have been hiding out in the Amazon rain forest but now that man is depleting the forests, they have to come out and eat humans for food. The typical rag-tag military group led by the dramatically challenged Casper van Dien try to rein in the vampires which now include van Dien's lifelong friend, an actor whose voice is lower than the Luray Caverns.It's all pretty harmless and not very scary, but there's lots of gore and hissing vampires.Fans of the genre will be pleased, but not overwhelmed."
2,Bits and pieces of a movie,"As a Casper Van Dien fan, i was able to get a small amount of enjoyment out of this, but it's pretty sloppy. It's as if the director were making scenes, instead of a coherent movie. So, what you get are bits and pieces of a story, but nothing you can enjoy as a whole. Loved the cave setting for the climax, but the jungle scenes are so similar, it looks as if they were all filmed on one acre of land."
2,Fine for storage,"These are fine for storage, but I got tired of having to pour into other bottles to feed. I found the Avent pump conversion kit online and bought that. With it, I can screw the Avent bottles I use to feed my baby right onto the shields. That was a better buy than this."
4,useful for storage,i use this to store breastmilk so my husband can feed the baby. i also use the bottles to freeze breastmilk. its great because its compatible for the medela pump but my baby isnt that fond of the nipples. i end up using the avent for feeding and transfer the milk from the medela. buy this if you are planning on storing a lot of milk. otherwise you are better off with avent or gerber new traditions.
2,I just wanted bottles...,"not nipples and rings and caps... a set of 10 bottles that can be used for freezer storage too. Now I don't have to buy the freezer bags anymore, unless I am storing A LOT of milk.I have heard the nipples, etc. that come with this set don't work well. If you want to be able to feed from the bottles that come with your medela pump, the Evenflo Elite line has a nipple and ring that fit these bottles. They come in different flow rates too. I always keep one with the pump in case I suddenly have a hungry baby!"
4,great,"I bought several different bottles and nipples; these always remained my favorite. I wish they had 8oz bottles as well. When my son needed bigger bottles, I bought bigger bottles but continued to use the madela lids, caps and nipples."
2,Too Expensive!,"I wish I had not bought these BEFORE I really had experience with pumping and feeding, didn't know what I needed and just got the set that goes with the pump. This week I went to my nearby ...store and bought *16* 4 oz Evenflo bottles ...- no nipples but I don't need too many more. I don't see the Evenflo bottles on the site, sorry. My 5 wk old baby is also having some issues with these nipples, as noted by the other reviewers below."
2,Not good for feeding,"These bottles are useful for storing milk....they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely. My baby hates them for feeding, however. I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles. I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby...and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast. Um, no. Take one look at them and it's pretty clear. My baby wouldn't even take it in her mouth. She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples, however. Much, much better!"
4,"Good for storage, not for feeding","I use the pump-in-style advanced breastpump, and I really like that these bottles screw right into the pump assembly. I like having many bottles on hand so that I don't need to wash them every day. I don't freeze my milk in these (I use Gerber bags), but they're great for temporary storage until pouring into the feeding bottles. I use Avent bottles as my baby seems to like the shape and flow of the newborn nipples (these nipples seem too fast-flowing)."
3,"Bottles are Great, but Don't Really Need the Nipples....","These bottles are great! I love pumping and storing milk in them. However, the nipples and all of the other pieces are not needed if you're using other bottles (which I think most people would be). I hear they're great slow flow nipples however I'd be happy with just the bottles in this set."
4,Decent set,"I do like this set. I have recently had to stop breastfeeding, but I still sterilize and use the bottles for mixing formula, but I know that my daughter will outgrow them soon (the bottles are only 5 oz.). My only issue with the set are the nipples... they are okay, they seem a little too flexible. My daughter sort of twists them up in her mouth and seems to get a lot more air than when we use the nipples the hospital gave us. However, the collars and caps are very convenient. All in all, not a bad purchase, even if i was only able to breastfeed for 6 weeks."
4,"Containers are great, although the nipples seem to have too fast of a flow.","The containers are great, and all total, I have eight of these containers. I also have four Lansinoh containers which also work with the medela pump that I have. I prefer the Medela 2.5 oz. containers for freezing because they have an area where you can write the date with a dry-erase marker. I have twenty-four of the 2.5 oz, and that is what I use for freezing. When using the bottle part of these, the nipple seems to have a much faster flow than the Nuk Orthodontic Slow Flow bottles as my son gets a lot of milk dribbling down his mouth and shirt when we use these. My son does very well on the Nuk Slow Flow bottles -- So I don't use the nipple part very often, but the containers are nice and convenient and a great size for pumping and storing at work."
3,Not practical for usage of bottles for feeding,"This was great to pump milk right in to, using the Madela hand held pump, as attachments screw right in to the bottles. After pumping milk, they seal up very nicely, and store in the fridge airtight. However, after heating the bottles, and screwing in the nipple attachments to them, our baby didn't feed well out of them, much too fast of a flow, messy, and the latex nipples had strong latex smell, (and I imagine latex taste to baby, we prefer silicone)our baby rejected feedings from these bottles. Nipples were much too small, also, baby would put entire mouth around them, not practical for switching between bottle and breast. I ended up just using them to pump and store milk in, and would nurse baby, and then pour milk in to Playtex Nurser bottles with silicone nipples, to take with me for outside feedings."
3,Expensive-- There Are Alternatives for Storage!,I have the Medela Pump In Style Traveler pump and needed additional storage containers for the milk. I like the Medela collection/storage bottles in terms of quality. They hold over 5 oz. of milk and seem to seal well. However this set was very expensive to me.. my baby takes the Avent bottles so I just needed something simply for collecting and storing temporarily in the fridge. I didn't need all the caps and nipples that came in this set. But I wanted something more reuseable than the bags. My husband figured out that you can use the Evenflo collection/storage containers with the Medela pump. We got 4 Evenflo bottles for only 4.99-- I could get about 16 collection bottles for the price of 4 Medela ones!
2,"Good for pumping and storage, bad for feeding","I have a medela ""pump in style"" breastpump, so I use this set daily. It is great for pumping and for storage, but I can't use these nipples for feeding because the milk comes out of the nipple much to quickly (even though they claim to be ""low flow"" nipples). I had to buy Nuk's low flow nipples instead, and they have worked well with this set. So if you use this set, I would suggest buying other low flow nipples to use with it. Other than that, the set works well."
4,Use Gerber bottles for pump,"The medela bottles are fine for collection which is what I use them for. Then I pour the milk into Avent bottles. Anyway, I got sick of washing the Medela bottles EVERYDAY, but didn't want to shell out the $$ for more Medela bottles. Gerber bottles work just as well on the pump and are only $1 per bottle!!"
4,Good basic system,"I like that the caps seal well, the bottles fit in the ice pack that comes with the pump in style advanced breast pump. When my baby was ready for a faster flow nipple, however, I have been unable to find them (my guess is that Medela doesn't make them). So now my little boy is used to these Medela slow flow nipples but I have to get him used to something else now that he is getting bigger. Ah well. I am still happy with my purchase."
4,Great!!!!,"I needed to pump when I went back to work and I bought a couple of these on top of those that were provided with the Medela Pump In Style. They are very resistant, easy to clean, and the rings and caps are very useful.I only put 4 stars because the nipples are useless if your baby is already using another brand, and I would have prefered another bottle and accessories instead."
5,THESE ARE THE BEST!,"I love these bottles because the nipples are perfect for newborns accustomed to the [...]! They are slow enough so baby won't take in to much milk and choke! Even if you don't own a medela pump, these bottles are the best for formula too!!"
4,Great,"This is really handy with the mini electric pump that I have. I can pump straight into the bottles. I just use the bottle occasionally so this item works great for me. The nipples are a fast flow so the first time I fed my baby, the milk flow was too fast. I just picked up geber nuk slow flow nipples and it's perfect for my baby."
4,Great even for formula!,"I got the Medela bottles because I intended on breast feeding my child. Unfortunatly I was unable to do that. But these bottles work wonderfully with formula!My daughter retains much less air with the Medela nipples and she seems to prefer the shape as well. I found that when I sterilize Gerber nipples they become ""gummy"" and ""sticky"", but the Medela brand holds up very well in our sterilizer.I think the Medela bottles stand the test of time, which ends up saving you money in the long run and my baby LOVES them!"
4,If you own a Medela pump - you need these!,"If you own a Medela pump then you have to have these bottles. They fit right on the pump and when you're finished expressing milk, just seal them with the two piece cap (middle pops out to insert a nipple for feeding) and store them. The bags are great for freezing but I still use these for collecting and storing in the fridge. The nipples and caps are convenient for feeding a quick bottle. I think they leak a little more than other bottles but can't be beat for the convenience and eliminating the need to pore into another bottle for feeding."
2,"Ok, but leaky the bottles aren't the best","I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right? Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding. Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now). I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage. I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those"
5,Good to have as a spare,Working full-time and pumping at work and at home. Needed the extra set. Didn't hurt when I saw them come with the nipples for those emergency feedings in the car!
3,"Don't Have this Product, but","I did not buy this, but I have the Medela Pump In Style. Thanks to those who mentioned that the Evenflo nipples would fit the bottles, but it's the Evenflo Classic nipples that fit, not the Evenflo Elite nipples. Now I just need to find caps that would fit without having to buy this whole set."
5,Great,"A fun and original story. I love the idea of it, and look forward to more works from this author."
1,Another nerd validates their own knowledge,An overwhelming amount of information without a simple beginning. The author jumps from beginning level information to way too sophisticated so fast that it will lose any non-technical person.
2,not for real programmers,"Pro: pretty comprehensiveCon: This book is obviously written for the people without much idea about programming. It tries to explain many basic things in an extremely layman's term, which may make a real programmer feel odd. I do think some serious programmers or people well trained in computer need to learn javascript too - in that case, this is not the right book to read."
5,Why aren't we encouraging our schools to teach ASL?,"I have just finished reading this book and I cannot wait to get it into the hands of my kid's teachers (and administrators). I am currently learning sign and so are my kids. Although none of my children are ADD or ADHD I know that some of their classmates are. The book suggests that sign encourages a healthier classroom environment as all the children are ACTIVELY participating in the learning process. The ADD/ADHD kids are actually calmer and all students are learning more. (Less wear and tear on the teachers!) By learning ASL we are also encouraging communication with the Deaf. The Deaf cannot hear, so why do we exclude them and expect them to learn our language? We have the opportunity to begin to change the world our children live in, one sign at a time. That is something to think about."
3,Maybe I'm just too old for this,"A friend of mine gave me this book as a gift a couple of weeks ago and I just took the time to read it along with several other books that I took on vacation with me. It only took me a few days to get it complete, but I think I'm just too mature...or maybe just downright too old for this kind of fiction. Just seemed to have no real point to the story in my opinion, but my 20-year-old neice enjoyed it very much. Therefore, I refuse to trash the novel just because the point may have escaped my 40-year-old head. There's an obvious market for this ""street-type"" fiction, but I guess I'm just not in it."
2,A Glamorous Bore,"The glamorous life is a novel based on the all-too-familiar ""hood-book-hold-you-down"" type of novel. It is about a girl whose name is Bambi. Although her name is irrelevant, it's almost as simple as the storyline in the book. Most of the novel was pretty unbelievable. And if you're anything like me, the last thing that I want to torture myself with is characters for which you hold no regards and storyline which is barely even reasonable. Although the book offers some very far and few between page turning moments, there is nothing in this novel for which I'd truly reccomend. Unless you are a devout follower of the 'Hood Book' genre, this is something you can afford to pass."
5,She has done it again,This is one of the best books I've read. It only took me 8hrs to read. Much love to Nikki
2,Not Great,"When I looked at the reviews for this book I couldn't wait to read it. I can't begin to say how disappointed I was, the storyline was weak and plain over the top. If you've read one of these so called street books, you've read them all. Goldigging women seeking a hustler, and quite frankly it's getting boring. I'm amazed that people actually like this ignorance."
1,Paint peeling is more exciting,When I saw this book had almost 5 stars I thought it might be worth the money. I was so wrong. This book is lacking suspense. T This one I put down several times. The ending was good but not worth my time or money. Not only that but I felt as though I was reading a novel written by an 10th grader. At best it was forgettable.
4,The Glamorous Life,"The Glamorous Life was a real page turner about Bambi who falls in love with Reggie, but soon discovers at her engagement party that he is bi-sexual. After that Bambi decides only to use men for money, but finds herself falling hard for Lynx, who later disappears and leaves her brokenhearted again. After her relationship with Reggie ends, Bambi becomes a very successful event/party planner which leads some unlikely characters her way who attempt to set her up for a fall."
3,A bore,In my opinion this book was a let down. I read the reviews and thought maybe it would be gud. I was wrong. It wasnt horrible but yet i couldve saved my money and borrowed it from a friend
5,OFF THE HOOK !!!!,"THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT. NIKKI GOT IT GOING ON, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK TO COME OUT. BUY THIS BOOK IT'S OFF THE CHAIN. AND THE ENDING IS THA BOMB, YOU'LL SEE."
4,A True Playa-Playa!!,"Bambi is a young girl that has been sheltered from the cold, cruel world of being used by men because her mother has schooled her from day one. Use them before they can use you. But, youth plays its hand and she gets caught up, but like a 'real black woman' she picks her face up and plays the game like its supposed to be played. Enter an OG that likes what the package before him, and despite a preceding rep tries her out for starters. It's a fantastic voyage, but like life as we all know, one day you have to wake up.This book has a good story line, but it could have stood to have a little more meat and cheese. But, all in all, it's still a great read! Good job Ms. Turner!"
5,Fabulous,"The Queen of Hip Hop Fiction has graced her readers with another guided tour into the world of the playas and those who get played. Bambi, the main character in ""The Glamorous Life"" is tired of getting played and decides to flip the script. Attempting to protect her heart, Bambi changes her identity and becomes known as a gold-digga with no time for love. Until she meets up with Lynx.Nikki Turner is not playing any games. Sis came out swinging with this fast-paced page-turner. Kudos to Nikki for another best-seller."
5,THE GLAMOROUS LIFE!,"I am not about to write a long review...But, I have read a great deal of gansta/thug books, this being by far the BEST!I truly read this book in 1 day. I kept me going and I was afraid to put it down! It had so many twists and turns that it was unreal!I suggest this book to everyone!!!!!*** CAN'T WAIT FOR THE PART 2****"
3,Part 2 please,This book was good but I kind of took my time reading it. I think the sub titles to the being of a new chapter kind of told the story. You kind of knew what was going to happen but the book was good and the end will leave you wondering what going to happen next. So i guess there is a part 2 coming soon.
3,Not Impressed,"I won't say this book was bad it just was not anything to brag about either. The story was okay just not to believable.I did love Ruby's character I thought that was funny as h*ll.Only thing I can say is I guess the phrase ""Use what you got, to get what you want"" fits this perfectly."
5,PAGE TURNER........,"This book was GREAT, read in 1 day. A definite page turner, from the first page to the very last. I am definitely a NIKKI TURNER fan. I hope a pt. 2 is in the making. If I could have given this book more stars, I would have."
5,Uh True BLACK BARBIE.!,"Lmao ; this book was a mess in the beggining ; i loved Bambi ; i think this would of have a sequel ; i wish the best for Bambi , Her Guy , And Their "" Baby """
2,To Jerry Springer-ish for my taste,"I give the book two stars for at least being somewhat entertaining. However the plot was to much like trash tv for my liking complete with homo-thugs, drug dealers, baby mamas, ect. The characters' actions were unbelievable and the plot, such as it was, too inconceivable. This book could have used better proofreading i.e. refering to God as ""he"", when it should read ""He"" or ""Him."" I am sure this book will appeal to those find designer lable name dropping, ""shot-calling"", ""gaming"" and hustling ""glamorous."""
3,It was alright,"For some reason this book though a good read, did not leave me with the impression to continue talking about it afterward. This book like someone else stated is very similar in plot to almost all of them. I feel that she could have summed it up in one book and changed the plot just a tad to make it more interesting because it was slowwwwwww.... and boring at times. Does anyone know if there is a part 2? Cause the way it ended was like what de f***? All in all if you want to spend the money out of curiosity go ahead, but if you are buyng it thinking it is out of this world save your money."
1,A Completely Different POV,"I officially know not to buy another Nikki Turner book, her style and stories just aren't for me. The struggles and underlying themes are the same: karma, because what goes around comes around, hold your man down for whatever because if he sets you up you move on, but remember hold yourself down while staying in full length furs, and get all of someone else's money for the best revenge.Maybe I'm spoiled after reading Mina's Joint but I don't feel the love and passion between Turner's characters in any of her books. All I get from them is that they are about a hustle. Hustle him, them, work, blah blah blah. She makes love a hustle because drugs are involved.I'm not trying to say anyone is copying anyone but what's up with the few sentences about Bambi having a sister named Yarni. Hustler's Wife didn't make much of an impression on me but that's the name. At least the sisters can bond over their experiences of hustling. Awww"
3,Repeat,Why is all of her books a repeat of The Hustler's Wife? Please let's move on. Overall it was a decent read.
5,I LOVED IT!,I read this book in one day. I just could not go to sleep until I finished the book. Nikki Turner has done it again!!
3,The Glamorous Life,"I liked this book, but I think the story was drawn out. I'm wondering what's going to happen in part two."
4,GOOD READ,"I read this book and it is really good. Nikki Turner my girl 4 lyfe has done it again. Her previous book to me were better, but this a good book none the less. Cant wait for her next book."
3,All that glitters.....,"This book was average. No doubt i love Niki Turner but after awhile you get kinda tired of reading about the same thing over and over, money, mens, ballers, furs etc... But Niki is eloving in her work and it's atarting to show somewhat. Get this book from a friend or the library."
2,OK guide to DFT,"I read this book to help me study for my Ph.D. comprehensive exams. It is slightly outdated for this field (published in 1997), and I would not recommend someone to read this book. The topics in it are covered in more detail in other texts. As a proceedings of a summer school in theoretical physics, the level of math and physics is probably beyond most non-physics majors. This book is not suitable for someone who is learning DFT, which I find surprising since this book is from a summer school. This book is more suitable for experienced hands; people who have several years of DFT simulations under their belt."
2,Not a scholarly edition,"While this collection has all the poems of John Donne like it promises, it has no glosses or footnotes. Also, some words differ from Oxford and Norton editions. If you're buying this for a class, you might want to choose a different collection of Donne poems."
2,"Inadequate table of contents, poems run together","This does seem to be a complete Kindle collection of Donne's poems, and they are properly laid out on the page (ie they do not run together like prose, as happens in some Kindle editions of poetry). But the table of contents takes the reader only to the first poem of different sections of the collection. Although each section has its own table of contents, these are not interactive - so that the only way of finding a specific poem in this big collection is to go to the beginning of the relevant section and then go through it page by page. Also, there are no page breaks - or sometimes even line breaks - between the poems, so that the title of one poem appears immediately after the last line of the previous one. This is the kind of mediocre editing that, in 2011, would barely be acceptable in a free edition, and certainly not for a book for which the editors are asking $3.99 . I hope they correct these errors and issue an updated version."
5,Always lovely,It was long time ago when I first became to know the poetry of John Donne. They are still so lovely to return to. Kindle edition is highly appreciated since my printed version is already read into pieces!
2,Inadequate,"I can only second what an earlier reviewer has said: the poems are here, but the table of contents is inadequate -- it does not link to individual poems -- and there are no stanza breaks, everything just runs together. Call me a stickler, but stanza breaks are important in poetry. The production quality is what you get from free versions not paid ones."
1,Waste of money,this was terrible. It did not work. I contacted company for a refund with no sucess. The cables were the only things that worked. Everything else was junk. The connections were loose and you neve could get a picture or sound. Don't waste your money!!
4,The reader made the book,"This is the first James Reasoner book that I have ever listened to. The story is well done and a good depiction of the life of Southerners during the Civil War, particularly of women on the home front. As another reviewer said, I wish the author had finished off some of the story lines. For example, he does not take the Brannons to Texas. He does not tell what happens to the former slave, Roman, who is the central character in the first chapter of the book. As an animal lover, I would love to know what happens to the grey stallion.However, in my estimation, Lloyd James, the narrator of the audio version made the book. I listen to a lot of audio books and James has now risen to the top of my list of narrators. His ability to change his voice and the wide variety of voices that he uses is amazing. But for James, I would certainly have lost interest in this book.It's well worth the listen."
4,New Horizons,"Mac, Cory, and Titus are still in the desperate fighting of the southern army in the last days of the war. Reasoner did not close the story of the minor characters of the saga. The Brannons were left remarkably intact except for Will. The war was over and the characters were looking ahead to a new future. Reasoner could have a sequel or two to see how the after-affects of this cruel war were on his characters. A very good series. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
5,Very nice OST.,"This is a very good OST. It does not contain all the songs from The Twelve Kingdoms, but it does contain a lot of the background songs. The song that really stuck out at me from the anime is Fuushun (the song that plays when Taiki is grabbed back to Koukai).I definitely suggest this for anyone who has seen The Twelve Kingdoms, and wants to have the background music."
4,An excellent cd,"Once in a while you stumble across a series which music astounds and magically capture you.The Twelve kingdoms did that to me, its soundtrack captivated me and made me rewatch the series several time before i got myself to buy the 1st cd (saving up for the 2nd!).The music sounds like traditional asian music, with a fantasy twist. Not that im a expert. (rather im the opposite hehe).It features light instruments like violins, guitars and fluits to bring a light and positive feeling while utilizing bass, cello and drums for the negative/sinister feeling.Either way, for those that love traditional type of music flavoured with fantasy setting this is a must buy, The track 8 (i cant read japanese sadly) on the cd aswell as the series main theme: Getu Mei Huu Ei remains 2 of my all time favourites."
3,Not as pictured,Sorry but the item pictured is a holster with a waist paddle . I thought I was getting that but I got a through the belt holster that although usable is not what I wanted. Will probably return.
2,Where are the stars?,"Given the people involved--Shipp, Parker, Waits--I jumped when I saw this cd, but have to say it is the most disappointing cd I bought in 2006. Emphasis is on electronics and mood, sort of like a movie score. A few good bits here and there but overall unexciting."
5,Excellent,"A very poetic and wise account of a fading world that the author was lucky enough to be a part of. Quite moving in places, funny in others. A very satisfying book."
5,MY VERY OWN FAIRY STORIES,"""The Rubbery Dubbery Smiles"" was my favorite childhood story. Through a lifetime of moves the book in which it appears was lost. Imagine my surprise to find it now on Google and then Amazon. In its original format with original drawings, it is a feast of delight. Children of today might not love its sweet, gentle stories, but the Witch bringing her brew of smiles to a frowning world will always enchant me."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing. When I first bought this book, I thought it was going to be on the underground market/economy. I found out that it was not the only subject covered. Since this book covers more than one subject, each subject is only superficially covered. Fast Food Nation is much more deeply researched and is definitly a must have ""Bible"" on the subject matter. Reefer Madness is a book to forget quickly. Don't waste your money on it and let's hope that Schlosser's next book will be better."
3,Not as good as Fast Food Nation but still not bad,"Reefer Madness is divided into three sections. One about American law enforcement policy pertaining to Marijuana, mainly concentrating on the ridiculous sentences that are doled out for a ""drug"" that is less harmful than what your Doctor prescribes. The second section he talks about exploitation of illegal Mexicans by California agribusiness in the strawberry fields. He treads politically correct waters in that part of the book but the exploitation and wretched working condtions can't be denied. The last section mainly focuses on the rise and fall of porn kingpin Ruben Sturman, who ended up dying in prison for tax evasion. This book isn't nearly as good as Schlossers Fast Food Nation but its worth reading if any of the subject matter interests you."
3,could have been better,"This is a powerful expose but it lacked the punch that Fast Food Nation had.Drugs, immigrants and the adult biz are issues covered but I wanted to read much more of each.This was like an appetizer, I wanted a full course meal.There are great stories along with facts but this seemed like only 50% of energy was put forth.Nonetheless, this is essential if you want to know more about taboo topics.Schlosser is a talented writer and I will pick up his next book."
3,A Disappointment After 'Fast Food Nation',"I loved Eric Sclosser's previous book, 'Fast Food Nation' and hoped this book would be as interesting. I was disappointed. Because there are over 100 reviews already written about this book, I will keep mine brief.The book is about the underground economy that Mr. Schlosser believes is contributing greatly to our nation's gross national product without being taxed. There are three sections to this book:1) Illegal Aliens2) Marijuana3) PornographyMr. Schlosser spends a lot of time discussing how the above are mainstreams of the U.S. economy. I don't doubt the veracity of his claims but the book was boring. 'Fast Food Nation' kicked butt. I couldn't put it down. This book, however, was a slow read. There were no new insights or surprises.I look forward to Mr. Schlosser's next book and hope it has the kick of 'Fast Food Nation'"
3,average followup to Fast Food,"After finding ""Fast Food Nation"" an engrossing and captivating read, I was somewhat disappointed to find this collection of three essays to be average and unconnected. The marijuana and strawberry articles are definitely superior to the last third, which deals with the outlaw-to-industry history of porn. It's good writing overall, just not really worth buying in book form. This experience was analogous to my interest in the periodical ""Mother Jones;"" initial fascination due to some good research, followed by a gradual decay of interest due to predictably one-sided reporting. Hopefully, Schlosser will come back with his next book to prove himself more than the average liberal journalist (there's enough of those). Fast Food Nation was great, but it doesn't justify paying for this collection of B-sides at full price."
3,Old water in a new bottle,"Mr. Schlosser has republished his magazine articles which, as to strawberries, contain factual errors. The California Court of Appeal has specifically held that Growers of strawberries for most Shipper/Packers are independent contractors, see Zendejas v. Kirk Produce (1998) 2d Civil B110632 and Herrera v. Kirk Produce (1998)2d B103704 and not sharecroppers. His work while interesting reading is misleading and factually inaccurate as to the matters I discussed with him some years ago. Connecting strawberries with pornography and marijuana is a non sequitur."
1,"Writer madness, Money, Cheap essays and the gulibleAmerican",Need I say more than this could maybe be three good magazine articals. Instead we have three disjointed flat essays without flow. All I could think of is Fast food writing.
4,"Interesting Essays, But....","Eric Schlosser's Reefer Madness has three interesting essays in it, but I can't quite figure out why the three are in this book together. In the introduction to the book, Schlosser says his intent is to expose the underground economy of the US for what it is. The first essay concerns marijuana and the ridiculous way it is handled in the US. Next, he focusses on the miserable lives of migrant strawberry pickers. Finally, he exposes the seedy underside of the American porn industry. All three essays are interesting and provocative--the marijuana chapter may be viewed by some as especially controversial. Schlosser's writing is well-researched and clear. But, the book just doesn't hang together as a cohesive whole, which I think it could if he had given it a couple more drafts--it almost seems that this book was rushed out before it was truly finished. Still--it is definitely worth the read."
3,Title is misleading,"Like the numerous other reviewers on here have mentioned, this book is actually 3 completely different stories look at aspects of American society and, how and where money goes when it is not exchanged above the board. The first section deals with marijuana and it is a pretty interesting read. Facts are all referenced and opinions are sprinkled throughout without being overwhelmingly bias. I enjoyed the book, but I had anticipated it would be all about drugs and the drug trade, not about migrant workers and strawberries. Good book, but not what I had expected. Shame on me for looking at the title and thinking it was all about Reefer."
3,sort of a Reader's Digest version; not enough meat,"Upon purchasing 'Reefer Madness' I thought it would be a detailed account at America's obsession with the criminalization of marijuana users. Wrong. Perhaps a third of the book is on this topic, then the author proceeds to address such heady subjects as illegal immigration and pornography to fill in the rest of the pages. Beyond this the author has almost a hundred pages on notes and an index. So yes, I was disappointed.But it has to be said the author had done his homework, and he writes well. He does raise some very provocative subjects and handles them in a mature fashion. But ultimately he does not cover enough of each topic, not by a long shot. I was left wanting more.Bottom line: the author has done much better with 'Fast Food Nation'. Missable."
4,Reefer Madness,This book went to a new level of muckraking. Not only was it just as powerful as Fast Food Nation but it hit right at home. I believe more people can connect with Reefer madness from all ranges of age. I felt that as a teenager this book was more interesting on a personal level. How does this guy do it?
3,Immersion Econ review for Mr. Jimenez's class,"Although it is slow at some points, I enjoyed this book. I found the information that Schlosser had to offer fascinating. If you liked Fast Food Nation, you'll enjoy Reefer Madness."
4,Representation without Taxation,"Welcome to the dark, where some things are happy to be left. Schlosser dances along the fence of our perceived morality by presenting three very underground markets and how they have evolved from their shadowy births to their magnificent prosperity--independent prosperity, that is. Untaxed money, radical employee/employer relationships, and incredible law interpretation are presented in the baited environments of porn, marijuana, and strawberry pickers. Yep, even the strawberry picker. Schlosser has once again, as he did in Fast Food Nation, brought to light the underbelly of the beast with the faintest of biases, leaving the reader to realize that capitalism is alive and well just about everywhere in this country and that right and wrong are but peripheral considerations in the end. The bottom line will always be the hand that rules."
4,"Good Book, I enjoyed it.",This book caters to a varity of differnt readers in several differnt ways. For example: If your looking for factual information on the history of any of the three industries this book covers them greatly and also gives rather detailed information in the examples used. On the other hand if you are the kind of reader who enjoys stories you will love reading about the actual happenings of the people involved in theese industries.
2,Lacking in depth,Seemed more like three short stories which were not very well developed. I'd suggest you spend your money elsewhere.
2,Three unrelated articles in one book,"Let me start by saying I thought Fast Food Nation was great. Reefer Madness (""RM"") falls far short of that standard, though.In essence, RM is a collection of what should really be three magazine articles. Further, some examples/stories are stretched out so long that it seems that the author is just trying to fill up space.For example, the longest section of the book is supposedly about the Porn industry. RM spends so much time on the story of a particular Porn businessperson that the book seems more like a bio of his life than a study of the underground Porn economy.RM claims to be about the huge underground/black market economy, but, the three sections (pot, migrant workers & Porn) seem largely unconnected. The book has no cohesive thesis or point.On the plus side, the author is a skilled storyteller and he does a good job of telling the stories of the players in the different industries."
4,Drawing the Curtain,"This is the second Eric Schlosser book I've read and it met my high expectations. He is an amazing journalist and is bold with the topics and ideas he sheds light on. Reefer Madness puts the pieces together, and realistically portrays the abundance of underground economies and its effect on the free market. I found many of his judgments have been brought to my attention before, but finally it was laid out before my eyes with great evidence. Although at times I found it both repetitive and plentiful of facts, I still thought this was a great read, and helped open my eyes to the present challenges of the American economy."
4,Vascular Ultrasound Benefits,"This book contains a lot of good vascular information. Some of my negatives would be that the chapters dont list the chap at the top of each page, so it's difficult to find where the chapters actually start. There are also a few typos in the text, but well worth the money."
4,Sonography review,"Absolutely loved my purchase. The condition was supposed to be used-good, but it was more of a ""like new"" purchase."
3,Jabra EarBoom,"The simplest headset to use. No clips, other than the lapel clip. No buttons or switches.No ear hook. Maybe the lack of an ear hook is preferred, I tend to prefer something holding the earpiece in place.But the Jabra earpiece firmly holds this headset in place without an earpiece.I have deep, softer speaking voice.The boom seems a bit too short to effectively pick up my voice.But others appear to have absolutely wonderful experiences using this headset.The product was shipped by Happy Cellular quickly and received in perfect condition via USPS.For $3.95, it's a great, inexpensive headset."
5,A pathbreaking anthology,"This anthology contains Berlin's overview, and his introduction to a whole group of Enlightentment thinkers. More than anyone else Berlin brought these thinkers into the realm of British and American historical and philosophical discourse. While admiring them Berlin does not buy the utopian vision of any one, and his critical insights are balanced and wise."
5,Realistic. Spellbinding. I couldn't put it down.,"I took Dead Man's Chest with me on vacation. Essentially, my planned vacation activities were put on hold until I completed reading the book. Roger Johnson related the characters' thoughts, actions, and words so clearly, and the story locations so realistically, that I truly suspect that he might really have found historical documentation of actual events. I hope Mr. Johnson will continue writing and publishing novels of this high caliber."
5,Dead Man's Chest is a must read for the nautically minded!,"I don't know how he's accomplished it, but Commander Johnson's new novel, Dead Man's Chest, is written with the same rivetting plot and clarity as Patrick O'Brian and C.S, Forrester. By the time I was halfway through his most interesting preface, I was hooked, and couldn't put the book down until all was revealed about Long John Silver's involvement with the American Founding Fathers and the Revolutionary War. An amazing tale of lust for treasure, sabotage, power, and how one man was able to manipulate both patriots and pirates to do his bidding. This is a must read for anyone who loves the sea, anyone who enjoys a plot full of twists and turns, and anyone who just loves a great yarn."
4,"Terrific story, great writing, lousy editing job","This is a very well written book with a great story. I am enjoying it immensely, but the editor ought to be fired. There are so many typos and other errors that it's hard to believe. Take note publisher: spend a little more time making sure your books are error free.Johnson's writing is excellent and deserves better care from the editor and publisher!"
5,Awesome,"This is the soundtrack from the best RTS of an era, in 5.1 surround sound. It is a live recording and as such there are imperfections (I.E. the flute's mic placement is just a bit off for ""Across the bog""This is a live recording and is incredibly high quality sound, the imperfections are organic and expected in any performance - perfect music is computer generated. This is played.Get it, you won't regret it."
3,"the game has claimed years of my life, but this...","i live and die, still, on rise of nations. the soundtrack is great, has all the in-game background music that i hear in my dreams anyways. one big, major bummer, it does not contain the great piece from the opening of the game, showing the many cultures of the game, nor the most striking menu song, the name of which i do not know"
2,"Nice design, but bad response time","The anycom mouse is a very nice looking design and the docking charger works well, but it is driving me nuts with it's slow response time. I end up having to click twice on almost everything. It is as if the rate that it's sending information to the computer is slow, so it doesn't sense a click unless you hold the button down for an extra moment. Fine if you work like that, but not if you're used to a regular mouse response.It is also pretty small. Great for travel, but my large hands get cramped up using it for extended periods."
1,Bluetooth connection problems,I loved the concept and it was a product that was unique in its time. The reoccurring problem I encountered was that I kept losing the Bluetooth connectivity between my laptop and the mouse. Very little support exists for the mouse.The mouse was not ergonomic but it is the price to pay for compactness.
3,Nice but useless,"It looked nice, idea of charging when using was great.Inexpensive comparing to other BT mice.But:- had to click a few times in order for it to work(register a click for the left button),was driving me crazy. Maybe mine was defective.- Mini size [I have big hands] :(I returned it."
5,Excellent Wooden Puzzles,"I LOVE Melissa and Doug toys. They are quality wooden toys, which are hard to find in this day and age. This puzzle is four puzzles in one. It looks like four animals fit into the one puzzle, but actually it is four little puzzles, and they just set on the red board to store. Not exactly what I expected, but my niece loved it."
4,"Great Education Fun, Standard M&D Quality","As always, Melissa and Doug products are a little subject to quick wear. Mine came with the paint a little worn in places. Wish they didn't make their products in China. Got an email from them saying they do lots of testing, but you never know... Lets keep our fingers crossed that there is no lead paint. Unfortunately, they are the only ones making stimulating puzzles for the 3 year old crowd. My little girl loves these puzzles and each one is slightly more complex than the last. Small enough that they never become overwhelming."
2,Not so satisfied,One piece of the toy is deformed severely when the box was received and opened. It delaminated into layers when tried to press it to be flat.
5,Best Slip Ons Ever,I bought the navy blue ones and I have had them for 2 weeks now and they are great best slip on show I have ever owned. The only issue with them is the sizing they do not fit true to tennis shoe size. I wear 10.5 size tennis shoe and had to order 8.5. Just be very careful when ordering your size. Had to return the shoes a couple of times to get the right size. Service was the best I could ever expect.
2,DONT GET SCR*#D BY VIEWSONIC!!,"Viewsonic should be ashamed! first one had dead pixels. This one has a dark water mark 2"" wide all down left side after a yr and a half. Colors are fine. Just started looking for a new monitor to have just so I can send this p.o.s. back for warranty replacement. I know one thing it wont have viewsonic name on it.I feel violated..even on sale it was even a rip off. JUNK BRAND..I feel technology is not ready for the lcd products. My epinion is to buy the cheapest one you can find. Use it and loose it! Maybe someone will find out how to build these better or something new will come out.Buy the way, For sale, va903b monitor. No I can't do it to ya' I'm not as cold hearted as viewsonic is..."
5,What an odd little groove,"This strange collaboration is a match made in some sort of heaven. The world needed a better rock and roll album. The world needed somthing that was half ROCK AND ROLL (!!) and half groovey ambient chill out yeah that is well-suited for a movie or upholstered arm chair.This is that collaboration, that intermingling of styles. And apparently, they chose the right guys, cause it goes off without a hitch. buy it"
3,thin,I'm not satisfied this product is thin and the pocket started to come off within two weeks of my purchase...
2,the great Ceviche book,"I am not entirley satisfied with this cookbook, both with the recipe's and the presentation. It is not an easy book to handle and there are fewer ceviche recipe's than the author suggests. Overall I would suggest going online and looking up recipe's rather than paying $18.00 on a margially impressive book. Better yet, flip through it and pick out a few ideas and go at it on your own - Not worth the purchase."
4,"Nice content,, the LOUSY trendy design a big drawback.","This narrow tall book is about impossible to keep open while reading or making a recipe. To copy a recipe and place the copy on a stand, you must ""break"" the back of the book to keep the pages apart, and the book will look tacky thereafter.There are some great ideas on ceviche, advice on related basics, even a recipe for Peru's papas huancaina (there's LOTS of variations!) , and the chef knows his stuff.Bad book design, could use more recipes, it's certainly above average with 4/5 stars."
4,Enlightening,"The other comments about the print quality of this book are true, but I found the insights and recipes to be well worth the extra effort to deal with the binding. There is a great story and excellent recipes. The philosophy of ceviche is revealed."
3,Great Information - Dysfunctional Format,"Douglas Rodriguez is a terrific chef and restaurateur...so are the recipes and general information in this book (which is why I gave it 3 stars). The publishers who decided to put this book in this long, narrow, dysfunctional format are idiots. I understand the idea of identifying the series, but if it keeps people from using and buying the book, it may not be such a great idea. The sooner they wake up and understand that form should follow function, the better."
3,Simple but Good,"What's funny is the Great Ceviche Book is a small paperback with lots of good ideas. I found nothing new in the book but at least the recipes and ideas were solid and when made, tasty. More of the fundamentals."
5,great book out of the gate for a brand new author,"Spencer Tillman's first book, Scoring in the Red Zone, is a strong book out of the gate for this brand new author. The book gives great insight into how the former college and Pro Running back has been able to balance all the areas of life, and lead successfully in each of them, as a father, husband, athlete, and now football analyst. Readers will find this book full of practical and helpful applications. The content flows well, and keeps your interest. Whether you are a CEO, middle manager, entreprenuer, or recent graduate, you will find this book a great guide for leading and finishing well."
4,Nice product!,"As a Firefighter/Paramedic I need a pair of protective glasses that are sturdy and that wraps around your face to protect you from all kinds of pathogens. I purchased two pairs; one pair of sunglasses and one pair of protective clear glasses. Both with reading glass inserts. After a few months they are holding up nicely. One big plus is the wrap around shape and the light weight, one minus is the detachable rubber nose pieces that tend to fall off once in a while."
4,Very good for the price.,These are very absorbant. I have several and I love them. They're very reasonable in price. A+
5,GREAT,"These are great to lay baby on for diaper changes,or to place over a matress incase your little one has accidents at night.My son spits up very bad after his bottles so I use one of these to line his seat before I sit him in it, I will even lay him on it when he is on the floor to keep the spit up off the carpet (it's very difficult to get out of carpet)."
5,AWESOME! Buy several!,I have several of these - one under the sheet on the crib and one under the sheet to my pack and play. LOVE THEM! Great item to have!
2,Inexpensive product - Expect substandard quality,"I will start by agreeing that these are absorbent...however, after several washings, the fabric has begun to pill and the pads (I have the smaller ones) have definitely shrunk. I have had to use a sweater stone to get the little balls off of them, otherwise they look horrible and feel even worse. I still gave this product 2 stars, 1 for the absorbancy, and 1 because they are a good idea and great to have on hand. I keep them in the top drawer of my son's changing table and like to throw them on top of the changing pad cover when I know I'll be getting into more than just a wet diaper. Just a little too much work with washing and ""deballing"" - I'd rather spend more money on a more quality product that withstands the contstant washings associated with anything coming in contact with an infant."
5,Very good waterproof pad,"These pads are very waterproof,yet pretty soft and quilted. My daughter is a wetting machine and always surprises me as soon as I get her diaper off. These pads have saved my changing table. I fold them in two and when she wets one side I spray Bac-out on the wet spot and refold the wet spot inside so that I can re-use the pad one more time. Very nice size."
3,Good enough,"I bought three of these. They are nice for airing out our baby's buns. They protect the floor or bed or whatever you are protecting. I don't think they are good for sleeping on, because if the baby lays on it to sleep, it seems to reflect her heat back at her and make her sweaty, so I don't know if I'd use it in a crib for instance. Another drawback is that if you wash the mat with anything that has velcro, those items all attach themselves to the mat. That's a minor inconvenience. Overall, this product does what it's supposed to do and is priced fairly."
3,serves it's purpose but not gentle on baby's skin,"I have 2 packs in different sizes. On the package it's advertized as a burp cloth. I've used it over a pillow on my lap, but it's too stiff to use over your shoulder. It's good at trapping moisture and keeping the surface beneath from getting wet or damp. It stayed strong after several washes. I used to lay my daughter on it to protect her mattress or sheets, but I find that it doesn""t breathe well enough and when she had baby acne it made the break-outs much worse."
3,Functional but not asthetically pleasing,"First, these really do protect bedding against leaks and spills. Get the bed sized ones as an under layer (which adds cushioning from the plasticky mattresses that are made today), layer on the pretty sheets, then use a smaller pad under the diaper area. This protects the sheets but the very bottom pad protects your mattress in case a true accident occurs. I must admit that after washing, these pads did pill but this did not deteriorate their effectiveness. I'd go to Target for the softer, thinner, prettier, and just as effective smaller size. It's the difference between wearing a hospital pad versus a brand name pad. Both work just as well but one is more confortable on the go."
2,not the best,"I bought the smaller version of these in a three pack. I washed them before our first use and they became very linty. They have continued to gather more fuzz balls with each washing. We won't be able to use them with our future babies beacause they look terrible now. However, they are quite absorbant and soft. We use them on our changing table and in her bassinet."
2,mediocre product,"I feel this product is o.k. but it pills after first wash and is not soft at all. It thought I could use it for ""tummy time"" but I don't feel it's soft enough for a baby's delicate facial skin to be next to. If you want to purchase this item save yourself shipping and go to Walmart to buy."
2,After one wash it looks horrible,"I just got this as a gift. I thought after reading the reviews that this product was great but I was mistaken. I just washed it and it's full of little balls and lint all over. I'm heading to Babies R Us to return it. There has to be another one that washes better than this one. IF it looks this bad after its first wash, I would hate to see what it'll look like after several washes."
4,A MUST HAVE,"I bought two of them when my baby was born (he's 9 months now) and I can't imagine what I would do without them. They work great in the crib under his sheets, and have saved me from changing the giant fitted mattress cover! The only complaint I have is that I also agree with others in that after one washing they're covered in pills. They're easily removable with a pill remover like the one you use on sweaters, but it's a giant pain. Definitely buy the white ones. They don't look as worn."
4,Great buy,"I bought 2, 2 years ago with my first child and absolutly love them. They stop everything from going onto his mattress I never have to clean it just take off the sheet and pad and change it. I am now expecting child number 2 and am investing in a couple more. great buy can't go wrong or beat the price!!!"
4,Very useful on the changing table,"With two month old twin girls, I use my changing table often. I use the multi use pads to protect the changing table pad/cover. I have several of the quilted pads so I can easily change the pad and wash several at once. They are also great for travel or even at other locations in the home where you want to protect baby!!As an aside, I have also found the Huggies disposable pads very useful. I would recommend buying some of the disposable pads (which are also waterproof) and see how you like them. Of course, the disposable pads are probably a more expensive alternative but VERY convenient. The disposable pads are also great for travel and could eliminate the need to buy this pad. The quilted multi-use pad is larger however and provides some cushion (although not much) than the disposable pads, which is a plus. The disposable pads are paper thin and do not provide any cushioning.This pad is just as it is named- great for multiple uses."
4,Excellent for toddlers,"It is very useful to protect the mattress during nights specially for toddlers. I'd found it very practical, you can wasch and dry in machine and it does not deform."
2,gentle cycle,"The pad is great because of its versitility, however after about 4 washings the back plastic has large tears in it. I even used the hand wash cycle each time I washed it."
1,choking hazard !,"cute looking but sadly a choking hazard, Puppies play around and can get caught on something, that thing turns into a choker."
5,Theater copy of You Can't Take it With You,You cannot buy this in bookstores-it is nice to be able to get it from Amazon. If you want to read this play for any reason this is where you have to buy it.
5,Filled with Hilarious Hype!,"Reading ""You Can't Take It With You"" brought back so many memories. This play is full of fireworks, plays, kittens, and everything that comes together to create entertaining chaos! This play can be enjoyed by all ages. High School theatre teachers will smile as their students take pride in portraying characters like Penny, Mr. De Pinna and Essie! This story will stay in your mind as a warm memory."
3,"gg allin, ruler of the world","good cd, but sometimes very bad quality!there are much better cd's of gg allin out there!!"
4,A Solid Book!!!,"As someone who is 1/2 Spanish and lived there for five years in La Mancha, I can say that this book is a great book about the Spanish people and the great history that Spain has. While there are some facts that are untrue (the origin of the Iberians for example), the book is an overall joy to read. Crow captures the sorrows and pleasures of Spain and the Spanish people like no other author has before or since. I recommend this book for introductory Spanish history and then read The New Spaniards to pick up where this book left off, the end of the Franco regime up to modern day. Please everyone, if you have the means, come and visit Spain and see for yourself how wonderful this land really is."
5,Hooray! You can get it again! It's back in stock!,"January 25,1999 Jason Aronson has just released the new revised softcover editionn of Being and Loving. Ask Amazon to get it for you. ISBN 0-7657-0204-5"
1,Being and Loving,The book was said to be the 1999 edition. The one I got was the 1990 edition. I did NOT want that one.
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"Actually I give it ZERO stars. Don't be fooled, every song is done by the BB Band. Why someone records junk like this is beyond me."
1,BEWARE...NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS!!!,"I agree with Daighn A. DuGally....ZERO STARS. This is junk, and a waste of money!"
4,Well written and researched,"I picked it up last weekend at my local bookstore, and I began by reading the ""juicy"" parts. I enjoyed reading the most recent about the most recent Presidents, but I found I liked even more the comments on some of the lesser known guys. A good summer beach book or airplane read."
3,An interesting read,"I am torn by this book, for historical value I diffinitely enjoy reading about the first 35 Presidents, however when it comes to the last five or so the bias becomes pretty glaring. Although Pres. Clinton was rated 21 and current Pres. Bush 19, Clinton got an extremely harsh review of his presidency and Bush was applauded for his not wavering for anything (even when he is wrong).However, I am a liberal and proud of it. Maybe that's my problem, but I don't think that when reading a book like this that a person should be able to tell if the writers are liberal or conservative. I think you should be able to read the book and just learn about the Presidents."
2,Rife With Right-Wing Bias,"You don't need to be any sort of left-winger to see that this book is heavily slanted in a conservative direction. The fact that one editor is from the WSJ, one from the Federalist Society, and the introduction by William J. Bennett is kind of a giveaway. The polling they conducted may have been more even handed, because the numerical ranking of Presidents fairly typical. But the essays provided by such conservative icons as Robert Bork, Lynne Cheney, Ken Starr, Peggy Noonan, and Fred Barnes generally go out of their way to point out the flaws in Democratic presidents like FDR, Clinton, Wilson, and pay glowing homage to Republicans like Reagan. If you're a regular Fox News viewer, this may be what you're looking for, but if you appreciate objectivity this isn't the book for you."
5,James Taranto at his insightful best,Taranto provides refreshing perspectives and a balanced view of the men who have had the greatest influence in shaping our nation and the world as we have it. An easy read.
4,"Well researched, well written and entertaining","I'm enjoying this book very much. The authors have long been established as respected authorities on American government and politics, and are very well qualified.They enjoyed writing this work, too. It comes through in the ""feel"" of the read. It's very helpful for an author to actually care about the subject matter, and this book has that quality throughout."
5,If you're a political wonk you'll love this book,"I found this book to be well written and very informative. Nearly 50 contributors (John McCain, Peggy Noonan, Theodore Olson, to name a few) collaborate in reviews of each president from Washington to George W. Bush. The style varies by author but is overall very good. Finally, each president's performance is ranked according to a methodology outlined in one of the book's final chapters. I recommend it to anyone interested in history and politics. Very enjoyable read."
1,Save your money,"This book sets out to establish the factors that make a President great and fails miserably in its task. While a few of the essays were written by well-known scholars, the vast majority are authored by people I (and probably you) never heard of.My biggest criticism is that the book lacks a coherent theme. Instead the reader is confronted with a poorly edited collection of essays that bounce around from President to President without any real structure or connecting theme, which you would think is supposed to be ""What makes a President great?"" The book is a good idea, but the editors seem to have just taken what was given to them and not put much effort into the project. Save your money."
3,"OK, but somewhat boring","I just finished this book and it was just marginally ok. I mean from the title ""Presidential Leadership"" I would think they would discuss the qualities that make a great leader while using the presidents as real examples. So what makes Washington ranked so high? I don't know, the book didn't say. The analysis portion if you even call it that, is very small. Most of the profiles is just history which you can get from any good textbook. There are some great topics toward the end of the book such as ""Presidential Leadership during Wartime"" or ""...and Economy"". But I'm afraid people won't even make it to that part of the book because the profiles are boring and uninsightful."
1,a yawn plus very biased conventional wisdom,if you buy this do not expect to be reading an unbiased account of history. . .this is a line up of conservatives reviewing the past presidents and is an attempt to write history from that perspective. The writings are all from intelligent people but the book has a clear agenda. . . Not Reccomended unless you like propaganda
1,Exercise in Futility,"James Taranto's book starts with a premise that it cannot defend: the idea that presidents can be ""rated"" in a sequential order of quality, as if historical leaders are reducible to the same status as restaurants or beauty-pageant contestants. The book attempts a tone of objectivity that I found fatuous under the surface. Taranto's M.O. seems to be to affect the role of disinterested observer while engaged in the thick of political battle. The section on Reagan is pure hagiography, and you get the sense that Taranto and co. would like nothing less than to see the faces of Mt. Rushmore replaced with four Reagans. I would recommend this book only for those who regard presidents with idolatry rather than seeing them in the context of the times in which they lived."
4,Criteria for greatness,"This book attempts to compare presidential performances which, because of luck (good and bad), preexisting circumstances, and the passage of time, are fundamentally incommensurable. Consequently, the ratings that are one of the book's highlights lack authority. Still, the exercise has value. The quality of the writing is almost uniformly excellent, albeit tilting toward the rightward side of the political spectrum."
5,"great book, good condition, arrived quick",Book arrived as scheduled and in very good condition. Book is great read for anybody interested in pres. politics and history.
5,What Was Millard Fillmore Really Like?,"I enjoyed reading ""Presidential Leadership.""There is a two to five page essay on each of our presidents. Each essay is written by a different author. All of this makes for meaty, well-written prose.My favorite essay is Paul Johnson, the famous British historian on Bill Clinton. The incident Johnson relates in an Engish pub with Clinton going full steam is priceless.I also learned much about our more obscure presidents such as Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Benjamin Harrison, and John Tyler.Although Franklin D. Roosevelt ranked third in the survey, he comes across as not having accomplished very much.Peggy Noonan does a good job on JFK, describing his charm as well as the astounding amount of medication the man was ingesting.Calvin Cooldige was more complicated than the image we have been given of him.Altogether this book is an excellent read and history lesson all in one."
4,Tush Cush Sqush,"I like this cushion very much. I would get the firmer one another time because I am a larger woman and this cushion is a bit soft for me. I decided not to get the firmer one because I was afraid it would be too firm. But I am very happy to have a comfortable and comforting wedge pillow for riding in and driving the car. I would definitely recommend this pillow as a good purchase tho' slightly expensive. I also like the removable cover which you can wash. If you are regular size and need a good tush cush, then get this! Otherwise get the firmer one!"
2,not effective as described in website,"I always have lower back pain when I sit too long at work but usually, the pain disappears after work. However, after using this during the first day, my lower back pain was way worse than usual, and the pain lingered even after work. Tried it for another day and had the same very bad feeling. I bought this product because of the good reviews but maybe it is not really what it is. Have to return it...I am really disappointed because I thought that I have found a solution to my back problem."
3,Tush Cush review,This product did not work for my car. The addition of the car seat made it too high for the existing car seat. The accommodation for the seat cushion nullified the positive effect.Too bad. I was hoping for a relief.
4,Tush Cush very effective,"I have found the Tush Cush to be very effective for improving buttocks and back pain during long car trips. It doesn't feel soft and cushy when you first sit on it, but the forward tilt of the pelvis really takes pressure off the buttocks and lower back. I'm no longer in pain when I reach my destination."
5,Husband loves it so far!,"I bought this for my husband to use in his airplane, as he is a cropdusting pilot and sits long hours. While he hasn't gotten to try it in the plane yet, he did take it with him on his 2 day drive to Montana and said it relieved his usual hip pain."
3,Comfortable,"I can't decide if it was worth $40 since there are less expensive ones out there. However, it gives you a soft seat when you need one."
3,OK Cushion.,"I'm in a car 8-10 hours a day and the seat in the car stinks! I was looking for some relieve for my butt and hips. This cushion sure helps and the cutout for the tailbone is a life saver. However, I'm far from big (5'10"" 172lbs) and I can tell this is starting to get a little flat already after 3 weeks of use. I still have too shift around frequently to relieve the pressure on my rear, but it is better with this cushion."
4,Met expectations,"I spend way too much time sitting at the computer and driving (3500 or more miles per month) Most of the chairs I use are very comfortable, however, the boss bought a used delivery truck with one of the thinnest, most uncomfortable seats I've sat in. The Tush Cush has the ride bearable."
3,May have expected too much,"I gave the Tush Cush 3 stars because it only helped a little. My husband has sciatica and finds long drives (over 15 miles) very painful. He shifts around trying to find a way to take pressure off his spine. He still is uncomfortable but maybe not quite as much. The pain down the back of his knee is less. I think the real problem may be our Honda Civic car seat design which slopes back and down quite a bit. The quality of the Tush Cush is very good, and it is wearing well (not compressing). Delivery was prompt."
2,Tush Cush Orthopedic Seat Cushion,"I would not recomend this cushion, uncomfortable over time, delays the pain of no cushion for about 10 minutes. The price is too high relative to the comfort or quality of the cushion, very disappointed in the product."
2,Not What I Expected,The cushion was harder than I am looking for and the cut out is huge. I may be good for a heavier person but not for me. I sent it back.
2,"Decent cushioning, but holy smokes it is uncomfortable","I suffer from rear and and leg pain when sitting. If you feel the same, don't get this! For spinal back pain, I can see where this might help. Gave it away and settled for some high density memory foam that doesn't bottom out!"
2,Didn't help -- Too thick,"So, I'm suffering from a broken tailbone that will not heal.I tried this cushion, but it was too thick to use in the car. It placed me uncomfortably tall in the seat. I'm a tall person, so it might work fine for some one who is short or has a short torso.What I found works much better is a a foam roll on in the small of my back. My doctor told me that having this to keep me erect in a seat or a chair would keep pressure off the tailbone. It has helped a great deal on long trips."
4,Good Cushion!,"After some thorough research, I bought this cushion. Its really firm-firmer than the others. It wasnt cheap but its definitely worth it."
4,Happy Tush!,Just what we needed for those long rides in our motorhome. Just in the last 3 weeks our cushions have kept our rear ends comfortable from Idaho to Florida and were still going
2,very hard,"This has a substantial forward pitch to the seat, and it is very hard. I found it uncomfortable and could not get used to it."
1,This Tush Cush not for thin buttocks,The discritption doesn't say Extra Firm (like a board). I returned it and will buy my next ons again a Bookstone if they still sell them after 4 years.
4,Very comfortable,Works well. Very sturdy. Holds up well. No sagging. Gives very good support. Much better than cheaper brands. Both my wife and I use it.
2,Tuh,Cushion had small tear on one side. I did keep the cushion and cover the tear with electrical tape to keep it from running. Wish it had a washable cover. The cushon is excellent just a flaw in this particular one.
2,Not as good as a doughnut shaped pillow,"I have the sore butt and back problem that prompts one to buy this kind of product. I have tried this pillow and the doughnut shaped pillow (with a cloth cover to conceal the doughnut shape, though it is still obvious) and the doughnut is definitely superior."
3,"High Fructose Corn Syrup, Yum","They taste great. I'll give them that. Oh, what's that you say, your kids think they're candy bars? Well, that's because they are--look at the ingredients. The first ingredient is high fructose corn syrup! As far as taste is concerned, these bars are tops, but the protein count is low compared to everything else on the market and the empty calories are through the roof. Let's face it, it's a candy bar with a few vitamins stuffed in."
5,Tigers Milk Bars - Peanut Butter & Honey,"I've been using this product for about five years now and my husband has recently acquired a taste for them as well.It's low in sugar, sodium, fat, and calories. This is a great item to reach for if you're looking for something to munch on for a snack, dessert, or just for a treat. The flavor is really good too."
5,A sweeping saga of an American family.,"This finely written novel is highly evocative of late 19th and early to mid 20th century American life. This is a humane, compassionate novel by a writer with a gift for capturing interesting characters. Longstreet is a prolific novelist, and this is one of his very best works."
3,..,I thought both books were good. I did feel however that the stories weren't as good as some of the others by this author.
5,Great Book,This book is a very good reading book.I will look for more books from the author and read more books like this one.
2,not as pleased,"I must say, I was disappointed with this book. had to turn back and remind myself who the author is. Just was hoe hum and written like rote. the characters were strained too."
4,Excellent read,Linda gives us excellent characters to enjoy. This book was shows us her ability to draw pictures of each character and their lives. Weaves a story that will engage every reader.
1,Disappointed,This book was written 24 years ago and should not have been reprinted. Linda Lael Miller's writing has improved with time and one would think she would have been embarrassed to reoffer this book. The second book by Cathy Mc David was also uninspired. Waste of money.
2,Book description,"TO LOVE AGAINKate Blake was caught in the hectic blur of Washington's fast lane, working for her senator father and planning the perfect wedding to the ""perfect"" man. Until both betrayed her and Kate decided to turn her life around. After dumping her useless fiance, she left her meddling family and her high-pressure job behind. Kate headed for Australia and freedom--and landed straight in the arms of powerful Sean Harris. Years ago, Kate had fallen in love with the handsome Australian pilot, but he'd married her sister--and now her parents blamed him for their daughter's death. Could she believe in Sean's innocence? And, more importantly, would she be able to convince him that she wasn't there to kidnap his son, but for herself--just Kate--and for love alone."
4,Just Kate,"Just Kate is a reissue of an old book. The story is good, with LOTS of sex. The conflict comes when Kate goes to visit her sister's ex and her nephew. The family doesn't like it, her dad is powerful, mom is a wimp, and our hero realizes he married the wrong sister. Much of the story is set in Australia and is fairly typical Lael Miller.(old style) I liked it when I read it many years ago. If you're a fan, you've already read it. If you're not, it's worth a glance."
3,A good holiday read.,"As an avid romance reader living in Australia, I am always looking for more authors to read. There appears to be a severe shortage of good authors which are published for release in Australia. I picked up this book, Just Kate, hoping to find another author along the lines of my favourites, Sandra Brown, Elizabeth Lowell and Linda Howard. This book was quite well written and I did enjoy it, but I found it quite offensive (being Australian myself) how the hero, Sean, used our slang. I have never come across an Australian guy who calls his girl ""Sheila"" as an endearment. Basically I found the book a good read, with plenty of sex, but not the sexual tension that makes you ache while reading it. I'll read other books by LLM, I hope it was just the Australian references that disappointed me with this book."
3,Another Aussie who likes the book but hates the slang,"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer! If an Aussie male called me a sheila I would consider it to be a HUGE insult. As much as I love to read the romance novels written by the very clever American authors, I have yet to find one that can write accurately about Australia, esp. regarding the correct usage of our slang. Strange how one word out of place can make you cringe....I was thoroughly enjoying the very alpha Sean until he kept saying 'sheila' - it ruined the mood each time for me & traust me, I would have loved to have been on that camping trip with him!"
3,Quick & easy read,"This story can easily be read in a day and takes the reader away into the world of Kate and her family...a drug dealing soon to be ex fiance, an over bearing father, a widower whom she happens to love- her brother in law... her nephew,etc. I had a little trouble with Kate and the fact that it was her brother in law who held her heart but she seemed to make it work and found a way for everything to be resolved. There were intesting scenes and other supporting characters that helped the story. It is an easy read and worth a few hours of living down under..."
4,"Even for Mr. Crow, this is out to lunch!!!","If you don't know about Rob Crow's stuff *don't buy this disk you will hate it* go buy Thingy or Heavy Vegetable or Pinback!However if your already a Crow fan, you may just *get it*. This is disc is off the wall, which is both good and bad. While the songs are about nothing and go nowhere, Crow can make a great melody with a pile of dung. There is no end to his simple genius."
1,Snoozefest - save your money!,"This CD nearly put me to sleep. I always have high expectations for Miguel Bose--and he seldom disappoints, but I feel he really let us down on this one. The non-stop, melancholic orchestral arrangements are beyond dull-and they're on every track! The one fun track is the duet with Alejandro Fernandez and even it is pretty mediocre. Thumbs down."
4,such a memorable book,"I read this book over thirty years ago and have thought about it off and on ever since. It has that kind of impact. I just now ordered it and can't wait for it to arrive. (Thank you, oh internet!) I remember being captivated almost immediately by the story of a young girl just a little bit smarter and more alive to the possibilities of the world around her than her kinfolk were -- there's a scene in which she and other kids her age are dancing around and shrieking next to a barn, and something -- sunset? a bonfire? -- throws their elongated shadows against the side of the barn. Such an amazing, powerful image. Sadly -- and this just rang so true -- being a little bit smarter was not enough to save her. And being a little bit more attuned to life just meant there was a little bit more to get beat down. But so beautifully written... I loved this book, and can't wait for it to get here."
4,Best read of the year!,"I know this is an old, out of print book but it is the best read for 2009! Such a true, ""slice of life"" story. I absolutely couldn't put it down. I bought it on Amazon, used books for 19 cents."
5,On second thought......,"When I originally read this book, I thought it was a book about nothing and very depressing, but reflecting on it I have changed my mind. I think about this book often and believe it to be a realistic story about the hardships of rural living. I will read it again."
2,no that great,"I am not sure what all the hoopla is surrounding this book. I had to struggle through the first 60-70 pages, then the book was sort of ok, but I would not recommend it to others as a good read. It is horribly depressing and hopeless, not heatwarming in any way."
4,An excellent tale of rural poverty.,"This book was very moving to me as I thought backon my mother's role in my life growing up on afarm.Though notnear as stark orhard as the main character's, Judith, it was fairlybrutal at times. I love my mother more for havingexperienced this book."
5,Like it was written last year...,"It really blows my mind that this was written more than 80 years ago! The struggles of the main character are really no different than they are today...with modern twists. It all comes down to doing what is best as a strong-willed woman for yourself and for your family. I enjoyed reading about such an energetic young lady and following her into marriage and motherhood. Really, a wonderfully written piece of literature."
2,"I wish I could give this more, but I can't","If I had only been able to drag myself to the very end... but I still would have given it only 2 stars. I read about halfway through and finally decided that this book must be in Greek.The one story that did something for me and earns this book its two-star status was the second one about the blue glasses. A young woman had surgery on her eyes and when they took the bandages off they installed blue glasses in her eyes so as to adjust to light before putting the clear ones in. But something went wrong, either with the surgery or the glasses, because she sees everyone with an animal head that defines their character. She is very relieved when her clear glasses get put in to see that everyone has a normal person's head again... but I won't take away the surprise ending. Get this book for this story's sake and you won't be sorry. Get it for a whole volume of good short stories and you will be sorry. Which is too bad."
4,The rough voice of tenderness,"Of course not the old Chavela, her voice has been hardened by liquor, aging, and cigars, but the drama and feeling is still there. That is what makes her such an icon. Time has given her an edginess in her ""rough voice of tenderness"". In addition, the ranchera songs on this CD are beautifully emotional and poignant."
4,Cry Baby Cry,"Chavela Vargas is a living "" Rancheras "" legend that can wail with the best . The rough voice of tenderness ... a TREAT ..."
1,do drugs help?,"I heard ""Beware"" last summer, it was all over Europe. I loved it. I turned it up whenever I heard it...even asked random strangers to pump the volume. Also, this CD came so highly recommended...all the critics were raving about its greatness. So now I own it and never listen to it. What happened? Most of the songs are a slow rap (a paradox if I ever heard it) with indian instruments in the background. The rapper sounds sleepy or high or a combination of the two. There are only 3 songs with energy...and they're really good. But 3 out of what, 14? Maybe it sounds better if you smoke while listening to it?Standout songs: Jogi, mundian to bach ke, beware"
1,WHAT!!!,hrfvbgrebv reuhreure rebruefbre reburebureh reuherudiaaaaa!!!!!!io[fjiofjbjnrejgnjbfek nfiwen kikfne krnioern fj ifi rioj!!!THIS SUCKS!!!!
4,worth a listen,"the song ""Ghalia Gurian"" is worth the price of purchase alone - A great down tempo song with tablas, flute, guitar and i think accordian? (not sure) and a wailing female vocalist - check it out. About half good and the rest merely interesting, but if your musical tastes run toward exploratory then this is a must have."
5,AmaZing!!!,"this album is the best...its got everything an asian wants...the hip-hop and the bhangra beatz creating the fusion which makes u wanna get up and dance...seriously its amazing. every single track. but for those who are only into hip-hop u probably won't go for this album because its pure indian (except for the beats) but i suggest u give it a try... if ur pretty daring to listen to exotic music, then this is the best!!! in my opinion, i could live without hiphop when i listen to this because it sounds much better.....word up!!!"
1,not what I expected,"I had bought this product as a gift, therefore can't return it. Before buying the product, I did alot of reading and was lead to believe that these were the actual bowl games. However, there is not a full lenght game in the bunch. It is only a narrator telling you what football is and decribing what they call ""highlites"" of the games...believe me it was a total disappointment. If you want to see the actual bowl games, you won't see them on this set...you will, however, see some old film clips of interviews with fans and the famous personallities of the time."
3,"Okay, but not like the Fashion Plates of the '80s","My 4 yo daughter saw a picture of the old school Fashion Plates and wanted them. Since they do not make those any longer I opted for these Barbie fashion plates. She likes them well enough. The paper that comes with it is kinda flimsy. I would suggest using regular copy or sketch paper. But there are many plates with designs on both sides. If you are able to find the retro version, I would buy that. But if not, this is a good substitute."
4,Endless fun for my three year old.,"My daughter got this as a gift from ""Santa"" this year. This is great for little girls who love to color. She played with this more than any other toy. It doesn't have a ton of little pieces and you an mix and match for quite a lot of different combinations. It's portable, which makes it great for the car. Also, it reminds me of my own child hood with the ever memorable Fashion plates!"
1,utterly disappointing,i read this book over a month ago and absolutely HATED it for most of the same reasons other readers here do.the only thing i can really add is that i work in a bookstore and i actively try to prevent people from buying this trash.
4,Fascinating!,"I truly enjoyed this book! Yes, it's long and the print is tiny and the pages are thin, but the story is remarkable in its authenticity. Arthur Golden did a wonderful job of seeing the world as a Japanese geisha would in the early 1900s. The characters came alive in my mind. I actually find myself thinking of Sayuri (Chiyo), Hatsumomo and Pumpkin and wondering about their lives. I learned so much about Japanese culture as well."
4,Very Entertaining & enlightening,"It certainly made me feel fortunate that I had value to my parents and that they had the money to keep me. To put children out as merchandise to be marketed and profited upon by everyone in their path is certainly another place and time to most of us. But it is valuable to all of us to know what lies behind our own safety nets. Very well written and researched, it brought to light what has been a mysterious sisterhood for centuries. I recommend it."
3,A cultural glimpse,"I saw the trailer for ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and was intrigued. I had never considered a geisha before, but I think the cultivation of a ""companion"" caught my attention. I thought, this must be based on a book. I read the book over a weekend.The book was well written and informative, the only drawback is that some descriptions had too much text and seemed a bit longwinded - it is realistic if someone is telling their story, but distracting while reading.Not only did the book provide more than a glimpse into the culture of geishas, it also placed that culture in the larger societal context - pre and post war and alternative occupations.The book could've easily been an autobiography - I assume the character types and setting are historically accurate."
5,The Best!,"This is the best book I've read so far. I'm excited to see the film version in December. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone. From learning some of Japan's culture and traditions to the unique love story between Sayuri and the Chairman, simply the best!!!"
5,Excellent and delightful,"Excellent book. Is the noveled version of Golden's research. He interviewed a geisha who later wrote her own book: Geisha: A Lifeby Mineko Iwasaki, both are great, one real, the other novelated. I do not recommend Liza Dalby's book, though, as it does not make sense unless you read these two first."
4,A Moving & Lush Geisha Memoir,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a wonderful research..featuring it's lush and graphic story line, and beautiful dialog. But ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"" is more than just good research, it's a fantastic, personnel, and (Not to mention romantic) exotic look in to this amazing art of Geisha, where eight year old girls are sold for prostitution if they can't make it as a Geisha, and young girls are sold for their ""Mizzuage"" if they do. (Which is basicallya ceremony where the young apprentice Geisha becomes a non-virgin.) When you are nearing the last pages, you wish it would never end, and tell yourself it couldn't... But all good things come to an end. And I guarantee, this book is very good."
5,Wonderful!!! The writer transports you to the world of Geisha!,This book is totally wonderful!!! The imagery and emotion of this book is palatable.You feel the pain of the young girl forced to become Geisha because of the demise of her poor family who live in somewhat dying fishing village.An absolutely must read before you see the movie!!!!
1,Did the novel betray Mrs Iwasaki MIneko ?,"WHile the book is indeed a great read, one must question whether author Golden did indeed betray the trust Mineko Iwasaki in Kyoto gave him when she told him her story. Did he betray her? She intends to sue for libel. This brings up another question: who wrote the book, really?"
1,Save your money and wait for the movie.,"Truly one of the worst books ever written. For people who enjoy Top 40 music and bland situation comedies. Contrived and predictable, it will make a great block buster movie someday."
3,Excellent Junk Literature,"Of the thousands of books that I've read in my life time, I found this book to be the most difficult to put down. Its plot is so ingeniously constructed and well-paced that it reads like an epic poem. However, even a great soap opera is just that - a soap opera, and you will find that the book simply disappears from your mind as soon as you finish it. This book will never be a time-worn classic, but you will enjoy its many delicious and empty calories."
1,Geisha,Excellent book. I saw the movie before I read the book. I had many questions about Geisha's and their lives. The book cleared up most of my questions. I will read it again at some point.
1,VERY Hard to follow due to subject matter!!!,"The book was extremely hard to follow due to the subject matter of the Geshia culture. I donot care for this type of book but because I am in a book club and this is what they chose I read it with a fairly open mind and was right on all accounts. The subject matter was hard for me to take because I donot believe that any culture should subcome to anyones specific wishes without voicing their opinions if they have any. I do tho understand that this is the Japanese culture, not the American way. I'm sure that alot of people liked the book but I as an individual did NOT."
3,It read too much like a romance novel,"i have always had great respect for the Japanese culture. It appears very rigid and suffocating -especially for women. But we always truimph with our innate and intuitive abilities. This is apparent in Geisha which I did enjoy and yet it was obvious at several passages,this was written by a male.I felt he missed the mark-not by much but still."
2,Does not live up to the hype,"Though Mr. Golden constructs a reasonably good story, he fails to energize his characters with any purpose or spirit. Sayuri's love, the driving force of the book itself and the only reason I kept reading, remains unexplained and unfulfilled right to the end. Why did she love him so much? Why did she love him at all?! Why did her rival geisha hate her so much? Sayuri herself is an unintended dichotomy. The other characters say repeatedly what a clever, witty woman she is, but the reader only sees an undecisive and pliable girl whose ultimate fate is a matter of dumb luck, not will. In an odd turn, I hope that the film version is better than book."
5,Beautiful and intricate storytelling,"Arthur Golden brings Sayuri to life and she tells her own story-he just holds the pen! The training and lifestyle of a geisha has never been made real in this manner. This book paints beautifully the culture, the people, the tradions of the time."
5,yay!,"When Chiyo becomes Sayuri, she seems to become a different person. It is as if the person she was in her childhood no longer exists. It is as though Chiyo has died, and Sayuri is born. Even Sayuri thinks of Chiyo as a different person that has ceased to exist."
2,Straight to the charity pile,"There's no way I'm going to recommend this to anyone I know. Golden couldn't seem to decide between writing a travelogue or a cheesy novel and ended up failing at both. He's got a few moments of smart dialogue or interesting factlets (the old lady's chicken-neck thing...eww) but those only seem to highlight the rest of the book's shortcomings (like the thin plot and the pathetic, one-dimensional characters). The highest praise I can give is that it's a decent time-killer and I wouldn't smack it out of someone's hands if I saw them reading it. As for me, I'm going to try to forget I ever saw it."
1,Incessant chit-chat,"Memoirs of a Geisha is an incessant chit-chat on ""misuage,"" waxed hair, beautiful or tore kimonos. It has little redeeming literary/social value, but one: she wasn't called a prostitute, she was called a Geisha, an ""Artiste who entertained the Chairman. Arthur Golden writes well, but given opportunity, Danielle Steel would have, with this subject, done far better."
3,The love of her life just doesn't ring true,"I couldn't stop reading this book, the description of the Geisha lifestyle was fabulous (though we're not sure how much is true). But I really just couln't get the fact that she idolised the Chairman for 20 years, a man 35 years older than herself, and to be honest the 'happy' ending brought down the standard of the book. I know, I know, different cultures and all that, but still..."
4,Intriguing,It was hard to put this book down. You truly feel like you are in the mysterious world of a geisha. This book was something different to read. My only disappointment was that this was not a true story.
5,Fabulous Book...... I just loved this book.,"As I read this book I felt as if I was there living her life. I found the book very interesting and informative. I could not put this book down. I found myself yearning to see what happens next but very disappointed to find myself at the last pages of the book. I just wanted it to go on and on and on. Mr. Golden is absolutely brilliant, I recommend this book to everyone. Thumbs UP!!!!!"
4,How can a man write a woman's story such as this one.,I probably wouldn't have bought the book had I known a man was the writer of a geisha's life story just because the perspective could be tweaked. I really enjoyed the book and then discovered it was written by a man. It was very well told and hard to put down.
4,Raw and Inspirational,"This book is the best! Great for Sunday afternoon reading-considering you wont be able to put it down. It is the story of a scared and confused young girl ripped from all she has ever known and dropped headfirst into and okiya,only to learn she will be trained to become a geisha. Along her rocky path to a full fledged geisha, you get caught up in her emotion and feel sadness, desperation and sometimes regret for the girl. A book filled with secrets and questions,all mostly answered towards the end. I hope you enjoy it!"
5,Wonderful,What a great book. It feels like Sayuri is an old friend. She overcame great challenges and showed the resilience of the human spirit. It was wonderful to have the old Kyoto geisha days come to life and get an insider's view. I could not put this book down. It made me grateful for how much freedom I have to make my own choices.
2,Beach Reading,"I want to make this clear-this is NOT literature, it is something to read on the beach. I rank this right down there with the Bridges of Madison County-written by a man, that for some reason sends certain women into paroxysms of gushing. It has the usual villainous rival, the Daddy Long Legs benefactor, the male fantasy of old man/young girl(oh sure, every pubescent teenage girl falls in love with a middle aged man on first sight and pines for him for years), mean mistress, etc. etc. There's too many good books out there to waste your time if you are looking for quality prose. it's fine for escapist summer reading."
2,Average at best,"Honestly, had my sister not given me this book I would have never read it. It pales in comparison to the work of Amy Tan, Maxing Hong Kingston or Shirley Lim.The writing was mediocre at best and I was sorely disappointed. Now, I understand why so many of my friends didn't like the book and refused to see the money. I'm going to the used bookstore and trading this in asap."
4,"A Beautifully written, lyrical book!","One of the best, hard to put down books I have read in a long time. It is beautifully written, lyrical and stays with you long after you have put the book to rest on your book shelf."
5,A woman's heart,"Historically accurate, this is the account of a young girl in China who hasn't a ghost of a chance to follow her dream, but survives with courage and patience to live the life of a Geisha. Her heart is broken many times, yet she perseveres to achieve the status of a woman fulfilled."
3,"Can you say ""Flowery?""","I enjoyed this book. I learned a lot about the Japanese culture: facts I can only assume are accurate. But that's where the fun ends. The author uses an incredible amount of metaphors, adjectives, and can never just describe something the easy way. This got really old. The believability of the book is a little hurt by the fact the author is a white man, trying to write from the perspective of a Japanese woman."
5,"Brought me into the world of geisha, a place I'd never been.",The emotions of this woman from little girl to elderly lady are captured by a man! I lived very briefly as a small girl in post-war Japan and I could see the streets of the town I lived in so vividly as I read the author's description. I loved this book and couldn't put it down. I've passed it along and recommended it to others and everyone I've spoken to about it (men and women) have enjoyed it. Hard to understand where the negative reviews come from.
1,Junk reading--a true Geisha would never share her memoirs,"This book was loaned to me by another fawning fan. It reads like junk food. The artificial flavoring may be tasty, but it was largely empty calories.For anyone who has spent time in Japan and amongst Japanese, the book rings false. It is purely a Caucasian male's projection.As an alternative read, I would recommend Tanizaki's Makioka Sisters (and if you can find it on video, it is a wonderful film as well)."
2,Beautiful Description Cannot Overcome Plot/Character Flaws,"Although the subject matter was quite interesting, the overall book was not dazzling. The plot and character flaws could not be covered up with the author's lovely descriptions. The spitefulness, stupidity, and bitterness of the entire book was not endearing. The protagonist herself was not bright, even though the author found it necessary to remind us constantly of how she appeared to be a ""smart girl."" Sayuri was also coniving and selfish. The ending of the book was unsatisfactory; the resolution of her romance wasn't believable nor remotely credible. Also, her treatment of Nobu was absolutely awful; it reveals her to be selfish and crass. The way that her actions late in the book were interpreted was also unconvincing. The ending was just uninspiring. I've DEFINITELY read better books. By the end of this one I was thoroughly disgusted with most of the characters. If you must read it, get it from the library. It isn't worth buying."
3,"Great wind up, but then falls flat!!","Very interesting and detailed treatment of geisha life, but plot builds tension only to waste it on hurried and disappointing conclusion. I heard the author speak and he said he spent 9 years working on this book, but he should have spent more time thinking about how he was going to bring it to a conclusion. First 2/3 of the book is 5 stars, but last 1/3 is 1 star, with steady decline over that period. Still worthwhile, but the good aspects of the first portion make the denouement even more of a let down."
3,too tranquil,"I'm not the sort of reader that demands action or high drama on every page, but I think a book ought to be going somewhere and this Geisha's story never really arrives. Seems like the real lesson about geishas is that it's an utterly superficial and subservient world, ultimately. Not the stuff of a great novel."
2,For historical and anthropological interest only,"A fascinating insight into the Geisha lifestyle and ethos, this work fails as a novel through one dimensional charcterisation and weak narrative. The rise of the heroine, through the Geisha hierarchy is revealing about that system, but not its main protagonist. The reader simply never feels this is a real peson -merely a useful instrument in Golden's quest to enlighten. One also feels gets the feeling that the author wants us to share his ambiguity about a intriguing, but immoral system of oppression. Part of the general trend to worship everything different from the Western paradigm. For ""culture"" freaks everywhere"
3,Entertaining but simplistic and weak on character develop.,Reading this was a bit like reading a good summer novel without much depth. It was interesting but too good vs. evil. Character development was quite weak with little understanding of the characters of the men that Sayuri was drawn to. In particular the feelings for the Chairman are not well developed.
5,From the moment I started reading it I couldn't put it down!,"Beautifully written, with a very detailed historical background of Geisha life in the 1930's Japan. A very well done descriptive job of characters, scenarios, feelings and even smells and tastes. I really love this book. I will highly recommend it and I sincerely thank the author for providing invaluable hours of amusement and entertainment. Really captivating!!!"
4,Interesting and very entertaining,"I enjoyed the characters, the setting, and the story. What a great book! This is one of my favorite books this year."
2,I bid popular fiction a fond adeiu after this one.,"This book at first seemed to me like a modern-day Dicken's novel. I couldn't putit down. I read all 430 pages in three days. The problem is that after the great story development at the beginning of the novel, the last half of the novel is not that informative and, in fact, quite boring. In the end I really feel that for all I learned about geisha, I really didn't learn that much at all!! What do they do during the day, except pine for men old enought to be their grandfathers? After me initial excitment it was with much dissapointment that I finished this novel. I wish a woman had written this insipid drivel so that I could stop hearing about how well Golden writes a female character."
3,Fascinating (yet slightly flawed) read,"Memoirs of a Geisha began as a masterpiece. Arthur Golden takes the reader on a spectacular journey through the world of a young Geisha. However, I must agree with another reviewer in that the book ends far too abrubtly. I does seem as though the author simply got tired of writing and decided to wrap things up - very disappointing. I would've like to have seen the book end with the same gripping storytelling as it began. Other than that, I really enjoyed reading this book and have recommended it to several friends."
5,grey eyes,"I have never been so mezmerized by the colour of a persons eyes, especially when they are only seen in my mind. the way this book is discribed is so wantingly believable, you never want it to end.I can't discribe my disappointment as i was getting to the last pages,i wanted it to go on and onlike a really good day. the depictions of beauty, love, hate, and cruelty were so real yet so surreal to a person who can't fathom such hardship in thier own life were comparable to angelas ashes which is a true story. I'de like this to be a commentarary rather then a review so i could tell the author about all the bits and pieces of the book i enjoyed so much, but i know i can give nothing away. Suffice it to say if you really want to be swept away by a book you must read this one, it is the first one i have been motivated enough to need to talk about after the last page was read at 2:30 am. hence , iwrote this review."
5,best book I've read,"From the first page I couldn't put it down. One of the best books I've ever read sorry it took me so long to discover it. Beautifully written, Be prepared to get totally engrossed"
4,Memoirs of a Geisha amazing and different,"this Fiction novel interested me and amazed me. I'm not much of a reader but I read this book for my high school english class, I read half of the book thinking it was real but I was surprised to realize all the fascinating love and suspenceful details are fiction. Arthur Golden is a great Writer and I look foward to reading more of his great books."
5,Left me wanting more,Wonderful job by this author to craft such a great story. Thoroughly enjoyable characters and situations. A refined novel that won't let you put it down. Don't overlook this fine piece of work.
3,Disappointing Ending,"This book was a breeze to read--fun, informative, and entertaining. My biggest complaint is with Sayuri's unrealistic and, frankly, stupid yearning for the chairman. I kept waiting for her to grow up and give him up. About 75% of the way through the book, I lost interest. I finished it, though, and was disappointed in the trite ending. Ugh."
4,Excellent Abridged Copy,"The quality of the recording is not in question. It is a great story as told by miss Davis. However it is not the entire book, it is an abridged version so if you are looking for the entire story, hard copy is the best option for you. Very enjoyable overall."
2,Disappointing,"Boy was I disappointed. Don't get me wrong, Golden know's his stuff. He has a thorough knowledge of Japanese Culture and History. But, I just felt so misled, when I realized that what I thought was going to be a an enlightening and entertaing read, turned out to be a thinly disguised 400+ page Harlequin Romance. It started out as such a charming story, but the subplot with the Chairman was so annoying, and the ending just ruined the whole thing for me."
2,"Interesting,but not great.","This was an interesting look into the life of a Geisha,but not a great novel. Where is the passion? Definitely not from a womans perspective."
4,Not as good as it was hyped up to be.,"Although it was very well written and it kept my interest, I felt that Golden (a man) wasn't able to convey how the main character (a woman) truly thinks and feels."
2,Don't expect depth,"Sure, it's a fun read, a good book to take to the beach. The book's best characteristic is the in-depth look at Japanese geisha life of that period. Enjoyable at a certain level, but that's as far as it goes. Our all-women book club read it and a few people loved it (the ladies I privately consider the least sophisticated readers in the group) and the rest of us thought it was a waste of time for the group. Not because it's a terrible book, but it's not substantial enough to sustain a decent discussion. The characters are mostly one-dimensional, the descriptions are lavish but unconvincing, but it is a fascinating subject. My advice -- wait for the movie, then wait for the movie to come out on video."
2,Disappointed,"I didn't like this book. Although I admire Mr. Golden's knowledge and efforts, I must say, as a Japanese woman, that I was very disappointed and somewhat disturbed by this book. The story is unnatural. Sayuri's behavior and emotions are not the ones of a Japanese woman of my grandmother's generation. I couldn't help thinking that something very important was missing throughout the book. People who are interested in Japanese culture should try reading books written by Japanese authors as well."
2,"Very disappointed, albeit mildly entertained.","There is some slight entertainment value in this book for those readers who aren't interested in anything with real substance. I kept waiting for some deeper insight into ""geishaness."" I was hoping for more historical background. I was wishing for some plot and/or depth of character. Sad to say, I was disappointed on all fronts. I did finish it, however, so that says something."
5,Written so well you can see the world they live in!,"I have to be drawn into a book by the first three chapters to continue reading. I was not disappointed by ""Memoirs"". The words paint a picture so powerful I could not put this book down! You a drawn into a world of unseen beauty, cruelty, and jealousy. The ending is enourmously satisfying. One of the best books I have read all year!"
2,All surface no substance,"From a cultural and historical perspective this book was of some interest. However, Geisha never truly gets into the mind of its narrator. In fact, it seems to brush over major events in her life. And the reader never really gets to know her all that well. It was quite obvious that the author was a white male. While Golden may be a student of Asian culture, he does not possess enough insider knowledge of what it's like to be Japanese let alone a Japanese woman. If you want a well-done glimpse into the mind and world of Asian women stick to authors such as Amy Tan who really know their subject matter."
5,Magical life of an artist,"This novel gives us a wonderful insight in the world of real Geisha's, that already belongs the past...Most people very unfairly consider Geishas as courtesans or exclusive prostitutes. The truth is, they were (and some still are, but very few nowadays) true artists who's lives were filled with sophistication and beauty, but, on the other hand, they were totally devoted to improving their artistic skills (singing, dancing, playing shamisen, the tea ceremony etc.) for a price of their personal lives and happiness. Golden's story amazingly delivers unique atmosphere of Japanese tradition and the smart plot twists keep us fascinated throughout the whole novel. Highly recommended."
4,Japanese Cinderella?!?,"A well written tale, this book shows the core elements of Japanese (Geisha) culture back in World War II time as well as a fascinating tale on one of Japan's most celebrated geisha, Sayuri Nitta. Even though Ms. Sayuri may or may not existed, Golden sure did a great job in describing the events that I could feel the pain, as well as the happiness that Sayuri undergo.This tale also reminds me of the original disney tale, Cinderella. From a poor girl in a small fishing village in the outskirt of Kyoto, Sayuri, with inspirations from her prince charming, became one of the greatest, most successful Geisha in Japan. So for a little twist from the old Cinderella, read this book and learn about the oriental culture!"
5,the best book ever written,"I read this book 2 or 3 times. It really captured my imagination. Although it is fiction, it seems to be very real because of how the author wrote it. He used many details and seemed to really catch how the japanese life style was back then.The story is about a girl who grew up in a very poor town but some how fate worked its way around her and she started to train to become a geisha. However It wasn't easy as 1,2,3. Her and her sister were torn away from their family, then soon torn apart from each other. The main character went through cruelty, lies, and she has to hide everything she feels. For a geisha was a woman who was only ment to entertain men. She had to overcome a very cruel antagonist, Who is beautiful on the outside but dredfully ugly on the inside.People must read this book, it takes you to a whole new place and time, and into a mind of a rare and clever character."
5,powerful...,"This is a powerful and compelling novel; at times I forgot it was fiction and was totally absorbed in the life of this geisha. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes biographies, fiction, or japanese culture."
5,A Truly Enchanting Story,"I have never read a book so quickly in my life, I just couldn't put it down. Arthur Golden has done a magnificent job really capturing the reader. I felt that Sayuri was right beside me telling me all about her life. I felt so many emotions from excitement to anger to happiness and sorrow. Japan is so rich with culture and history and I strongly recommend it if you are a woman who has an interest in Japan and its unique ways. This story takes you away into the streets of Gion, Kyoto in Japan growing up with Sayuri from childhood to the wonders of womanhood. This is an eye opener. I am keen to read more."
5,A Truly Enchanting Story,"I have never read a book so quickly in my life, I just couldn't put it down. Arthur Golden has done a magnificent job really capturing the reader. I felt that Sayuri was right beside me telling me all about her life. I felt so many emotions from excitement to anger to happiness and sorrow. Japan is so rich with culture and history and I strongly recommend it if you are a woman who has an interest in Japan and its unique ways. This story takes you away into the streets of Gion, Kyoto in Japan growing up with Sayuri from childhood to the wonders of womanhood. This is an eye opener. I am keen to read more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
5,Exquisite and exhilirating,"At first I was wary of reading this book because of its acclaim and because I was worried that a foreign treatment of the geisha might be biased or inaccurate. I still can't say whether this book had been an accurate portrait, but as a story, it is probably one of the best books I've read this year.""Memoirs"" is a well-written, plot- and character-driven story. It's written in a way that's reminiscent of Wally Lamb, but this is unique in its own way. Never was there a moment where the story sags or slow down. It's a rare and enlightening look at a secret culture that's both elusive and seductive.The ending is always hard, especially for a book like this where you want to see everything wrapped up. There is no perfect ending, and given the bond that author Arthur Golden created for me, there would be no adequate ending that won't make me miss Sayuri."
4,Captivating,"Before I started reading this book, I was never really interested in the Japanesse culture. But once I started reading it, I was not able to put the book down. It simply introduced me to a world that is not common in Western Culture. I always thought a Geisha was japanesse for prostitute but they were more than that. Not only did they entertain men but they were hostesses, taught to be well-mannered ladies and educated in the arts. Not only did this book captivate me but introduced me into the world of Japanesse culture. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about this culture."
4,Riveting - a fascinating portrayal of Japanese life,"I couldn't put this book down! It's an intimate portrait of a way of life that is often closed off from Western view. Imaginative writing and strong characters keep you reading, dying to know more. As I read the other reviews, I notice that some people don't like the book because of the ""non-feminist"" geishas. They're missing the point. The book isn't judging geishas; it's simply giving us an in-depth look at how they lived. The fact that the geishas sometimes hated each other and used men just makes it realistic. In fact, the author was able to take a woman from that strange world and make her likeable and knowable. Yes, it would have been perfect if the ending were more fleshed out, but all in all, it's a very interesting study of a fascinating people."
5,An amazing read,"I have read this book a long time ago, but I still keep it, because I want to read again. It is an amazing book!! I will get an ebook version, now that I have a kindle."
2,A book of exoticism,"I cannot deny that ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is very entertaining story. But to me, a reader having studied Chinese and Oriental culture for more than 20 years, this story is uninteresting, entirely written in a man's point of view. Throughout the book, it is obvious that the author is trying hard to convince the reader that the narrator ""is"" an oriental woman, i.e. the geisha herself. But he fails after all. And the result is, the story is full of stereotypes, especially stereotypes of Asian women (e.g. good girls and bad girls, rivalry between women...), Asian men (e.g. how they victimize women) and patriarchal culture. In short, it disguises itself as a history of Asia women's struggle (purely in the eyes of the West), full of out-dated symbols, cliche and exoticism, which only appeals to the readers in the West who are not similar with the Orient."
2,These are not real memoirs,"While I enjoyed this book while reading, my enjoyment was diminished when I found out about how the author used the subject's story without her permission and had presented many of her positive experiences as negative and many of her negative experiences as positive. If you want to read actual memoirs by a geisha who worked during the early 20th century, go straight to the source. Skip this and go straight to Geisha: A Life by Mineko Iwasaki.Geisha: A Life"
5,Breathtaking with lucid details,"Golden's ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is one of the best contemporary books I have read in a long time. It tells the story of a popular geisha during the early 20th century. While the end is lacking and disappointing, what precedes it is fascinating. Golden delves into the culture of Japan and how geisha fit into it. He writes the story richly and convincingly, a most excellent read."
5,"Geisha, an artist!","True that the author isn't a Jpanese women, living in Kyoto, Japan, in the year 1940 something. But I thought it was a great story about someone who may have lived back then. It's why we call it fiction that we are allowed to go into the minds of others if we please, and make up or own story of what it may have been life for real. It's not too far fetched to believe this may have been what a Japanese woman would have been subjected too. I have a Jpanese Grandmother, and I think this is pretty true to life, by what she told me. And I like that Aruthr Golden didn't make the Geisha seem like a whore, because she is not a whore, but an artist. Somone who endures many years of hard training, with sweat, blood and tears. I enjoyed this tale of Sayuri. I hope you will too!"
5,One of my favorite novels!,"This is a wonderfully written story about the life of a young Japanese girl that suffers a lot but becomes the best she can be. Everyone I know that has read this loves it as much as I do. The writer captures your interest right away and before you know it, you're living in Japan, during the war. I saw the movie after reading this book and was very disappointed with the movie. There is just too much to try and convey on the big screen. Treat yourself to some ""me"" time and read this wonderful story."
4,Exotic and interesting,"I picked this to read for a required summer reading for school. I actually didn't think it would be anything special. But I was quickly engrossed in the culture and situation of this particular era. It fascinated me. The characters fascinated me and I truly cared about what happened to them. I was a tad dissapointed with the end, though I don't have a particular reason for it. I guess it wasn't satisfying enough for me. But overall, a very original and interesting read."
3,Too Slow in Too Many Spots,"This book was HIGHLY recommended, people ranted and raved about it. I was rather disappointed in it. It has taken me forever to finish because I feel it doesn't draw you in and keep you there. There were parts that made you not want to put the book down but you would lose that the minute you turned to page. I would recommend this book, it just wouldn't be highly recommended!"
4,Being true to yourself,"I can understand the character Sayuri and to some it might seem to be a weak trait or flaw, the choice to do what she did near the end. It wasn't an easy choice, and I'd have to say it was brave. I made a choice in my life and took the safe or more accepted route, and I'm regretting it. Are you really 'living' if you go with your head and not your heart? No."
4,"Good, but slightly misleading","The book itself tells a great story; it's what started my fascination with geisha. But the facts are a bit muddled. I'd suggest reading Mineko Iwasaki's ""Geisha: a Life"" and Liza Dalby's ""Geisha"" in addition to ""Memoirs"" for more insight."
5,Fantastic!,"We read this recently in my book club, along with two other books that knocked my socks off: Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, and Bark of the Dogwood. We are, if nothing else, an eclectic bunch.""Memoirs"" is beautifully written and just a gorgeous book. I had no idea going in what it was going to be about. Well, perhaps a little idea, but it was nothing like I thought it would be. If there was not even a story here, the writing would be enough--it's that well-written. Poetry.Also recommended: Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and Bark of the Dogwood"
2,too repetitive,"I completely agree with wishnick's critique, prose with no soul, which was extremely eloquent and intelligently written. I disliked all the characters because they were too superficially drawn, and I felt that the writing was too repetitive. In fact, I skipped about half or more of the book, and merely read the ending because I could never NOT finish a book. Because the author keeps repeating himself over and over to drive in obvious points, I feel that I didn't miss anything, despite my blatant skimming.I'm sure we do get a good idea of what constitutes a geisha's life, though you can probably get better depictions by reading other books about geisha, and hence you can bypass Golden's annoying writing.Fortunately, I borrowed this book from the library! If you are still intrigued with this novel because of the high critical acclaim (unfounded), please just borrow the book. This is the type of novel that does not bear reading twice, or once for that matter."
5,Memoirs of a Geisha,I found this book fascinating. Once I started reading I could hardly put in down. The characters are great and it almost seems you know them by the end of the book. It also teaches you about the Japanese geishas and whole Japanese culture in general. Golden did a great job drawing the reader in and explaining the Japanese traditions. The story was very believable and excellently written.
4,"First half 4 stars, Second half 1 star","The complexities and contrived beauty of the geisha's life are fascinating. The first half of the book is compelling, and I found it hard not to empathize with the weak, innocent Sauri ~ intuitively discovering her new life. The ending was weak ~ it fades out with few details of her remaining life ~ and nothing about her powerbrokering in later life."
3,A Mediocre Work,"Despite high praise and much-touted attention, it was adisappointing read. The pace, from the very beginning of the novel,is slow...However, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA does have its high points. The research is exquisite. The dialogue manages to remain intriguing...The reader perpetually roots for the geisha in a battle of good vs. evil.Although this book could certainly never be classified as one of the finest ever written, it does merit reading--especially if one has an interest in gieshas and Japanese culture. END"
5,Reading this book showed an amazing view of Japan,I thought that this book was very well written and I was genuinely surprised when I saw that the main character was a young Japanese girl; being that the book was written by an American man. I barely was able to put the book down and I was very glad that I read it.
2,John Grisham goes to Japan,"A linear, stylistically boring chronicle that will be of interest to those ignorant of the life of a geisha in Japan, but lacking much merit beyond that."
4,Almost a 5 star book,"What an amazing and captavating story. It is tragic and beautiful to learn about the life of a geisha, however I was a bit let down that it was written by a man."
3,Fiction pretending to be a memoir.,"First, I have to say that the book has merits. One senses that the author has done a lot of research to bring us the details of life as a geisha. With the simplistic prose of a geisha telling her story, we almost believed that it was dictated by her. But, the neat happy ending reeks of a novel wanting to go to Hollywood, which is a real sad thing since I almost bought the memoir theme only to be treated to just so-so fiction."
3,I don't like the ending.,"As I am a Japanese, I can say this story is interesting to read and nice try to research about Japanese culture, but I feel sense of incongruity for the ending. Is it the western way of thinking? I don't know.....anyway, this is the fiction.Geisya girls have many skills, they can dance, sing, have knowlidge of political issues, communication skills, and STRONG mind to sacrifice theirselves.So I respect them."
5,Review,"I couldn't tear myself away from this book! I'm serious, I really did like it. The story is so rich, and it's almost like you look at the world differently after you read it. I think that the most amazing thing about it is that although the story is fictional and was written by a man, it gets to the innermost part of this woman's soul. It's so realistic, and although everyone is different, I think that all of us could relate to it in one way or another. As my friend who recommended it to me once said, ""It makes you cry and laugh and touches you in more ways than one."""
3,Go Geisha Girl!,"I found it an enjoyable and fast read. I got a bit annoyed with it in the final third. I ascribe that to a sense that I was no longer ""discovering"" new things (all the facts about Geisha-dom, and Japanese society), but it was by then a much more conventional narrative.I did find the language a little forced and what might be described as ""literary"" actually a bit pretentious in parts.Nevertheless, I learned more about geisha-dom than I would have otherwide, and found the story, particularly in the early stages satisfying and engaging."
4,Could not put it down,"The only not-so-great part of this book was the confusing names. I found myself looking back several times to keep the people straight. Other than that, I absolutely loved it. Not often can I not put a book down, and I finished this novel in about 2 days. I absolutely recomend it!"
1,As a Japanese-American I am insulted...,"Everyone screams praise of Golden, but most of the Japanese women I know who have read this hated it, as do I. Golden may have researched and trained for ten years, but my own music and dance training by a geisha taught me that geishas take twice that to train. A Westerner who attempts to write about Easterners is fine, but do not claim you can ever understand the nuances of a culture or that you are an expert on something when its obvious you are not. I was so insulted and continue to be that such horrible indiscretions about my culture continue to exist and are pedalled to be true by so many uneducated people. Being half American I am so ashamed that we believe a work of FICTION as truth so desperately. Its not about political correctness, its about misunderstanding a people."
1,a mockery to the japanese culture,"This was the most shallow and superficial attempt of a cultural novel I have ever read. I read that Golden wrote another poor novel before this one, also set in Japan, and the man had not even been to Japan before! When that novel failed, he decided that maybe it would be a good idea to understand what he is writing about. Good idea! I'd hate to see how it would have turned out if he hadn't.If the Japanese culture interests you, than please read Tanizaki's ""The Makioka Sisters"" and I promise you that you will realize what I mean."
1,Obviously written by a man,"My first thought, when I first heard of this book, was how could a white, American man write from the perspective of a Japanese geisha? The book's rave reviews, plus Spielberg's purchase of the story rights, convinced me to read it. It turns out that my original thought was correct. The prose is filled with cliches, and the story is quite inaccurate from the female perspective (particularly the scene where the heroine loses her virginity.) Why must every commercially hot property turn out to be like the script for ""Pretty Woman"" (i.e. an unrealistic, male fantasy)? How degrading"
4,"Grab this for ""by the pool""!","This is an entertaining story, and a quick read. It doesn't go too deep, so it is perfect for those summer days trying to read by the pool while a group of 10 year-olds are screaming and splashing nearby. You don't need much concentration to follow along. The characters are pretty flat, but somehow I was able to stay interested because the subject matter was so unfamiliar to me. If you are looking for shocking plot twists and juicy revelations, read something else!"
4,exotic memoir,"I think this is a reasonably interesting and challenging read, though it is wordy. I thought the recollections of the World War II era and the other historical sidelights added to my knowledge. I thought the first half of the book, in which the girl is torn away from her family in her little fishing village (also from her sister),while very sad, was a little better- told than the second half, though this is actually a straight line success story, from abject poverty to great success. Her apprenticeship, beset by jealousies, was interesting, with its many informative pages about the geisha's necessary talents, such as dancing and tea-service. Her elaborate coiffure, while not comfortable for her, also caught my interest. The book is tediously wordy, however. I thought the scenes with the baron were amusing."
5,Discover the world of a Geisha,"I was surprised that a non Asian author can write so well about the life of a Geisha, this novel really seems like an autobiography ....This novel narrates the story of Sayuri and how she becomes a Geisha. Personally, before reading this book, I had a very superficial view on what a Geisha is, this novel takes you inside the life of Sayuri, and Japan during the war...It is well written and not too hard for people who are not acquainted with Japan...I strongly recommend it ..."
1,worst in years,"This is the worst book I've read in years ...hundreds of books. My instinct in putting it off so many years was right -- what a completely romanticized, Americanized load of crap. I respect all the positive-review readers here, and I never write reviews here, but I just couldn't contain myself from trying to warn someone from wasting a slice of your life on this mush. If you want to spend ""time"" in Japan, 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami is a much better experience."
4,"A beautiful, captivating story!","This book by Arthur Golden has been on my ""To Be Read"" list for a long time! I thought the narrator, Bernadette Dunne, did a beautiful job. I think I enjoyed this book much more hearing it than reading it, as I could hear the names and words spoken in the way that they were meant to be. I have always been fascinated with other cultures, so this book was a real treat.The book is about a young girl, Sayuri, who is sold into slavery to a geisha house in Gion, Japan. As she gets older, she must learn the geisha ways and traditions of the geisha, including: the tea ceremony, how to wear the kimono, the elaborate hair and make-up, the dancing.The writing was beautiful, and I was totally captivated by this story.My rating: 4.5 stars!!"
4,Horrifying oppression shown through a compelling tale.,"Most customer reviews focus on the story of the geisha, whether they think it's fascinating or dull. One from Taiwan said it was ""deep and dark,"" and I agree. I was impressed with Golden's ability to expose a culture of oppression and rigidity in pre-war Japan, without ever saying so, and in the words of a woman who must accept it. By extension, he calls into question the values of other oppressive places and times. Pretty impressive work."
5,It is a culture-packed novel which is unable to stay shut!,"As a high school student preparing for college, I have always had question about what to study in college. I could either major in dance, humanities, or interdisciplinary studies. In reading this book, it has made me aware of how ignorant in the area of culture us Americans truely are. So, I have decided to study cultures and humanities in my future. I hope that I will eventually be able to decrease the amount of culture shock Americans and all other people of the world experience throughout their lifetime. This book shows the life of a working woman in Japan around the 1950s and is unable to stay shut. I recommed it to anyone and everyone!"
2,hokum pokum,"Interesting on the history. Quite absorbing, actually. Very plainly and simply written. Nothing wrong with that, though the language adds no additional interest. Overly sentimental. I think you're supposed to feel sorry for her situation and cheer her toward her precious and distant love - which, of course, she gets in the end. Of course. It's a formulaic romance as far as that goes. But kudos for the research!"
2,How about reading real Japanese literature?,"""Gee, that novel was so informative!"" Well, accurate renderings of a foreign culture do not necessarily a classic make.Try Kawabata, Mishima, Tanizaki, Enchi, etc. for real insights and real Japanese literature. ""Memoirs"" is simply a good story. Nothing more, nothing less. It telegraphs its punches pages in advance. What is all the fuss about?"
5,WOW!!!,"I started reading it just to waste time, but i found it so interesting i could not put it down. It is so discriptive of her feelings at times you feel happy for her at others so sad you want to cry. It is the best book i have read. I am fascinated by the Japenese culture so i found it interesting how they veiwed us at the time of the war. All I can really say is WOW!!!"
4,memoirs of a geisha,"I found this book to be not only entertaining, but also educational. While reading the book, I often found myself forgetting that it was a fictional novel. Some of the details got a bit overdone, but overall, it was agreat book, and I would recommend it to any woman interested in learning more about women in other cultures and time periods."
3,Disappointing,"I am able to give this novel a three because of the author's ability in historical fiction. The descriptions of Japan and the general workings of Geisha were quite enjoyable. The storyline, however, was very predictable and reminiscent of a V.C. Andrews novel, entertaining and suspenseful for a twelve-year-old, but boring for a more mature audience."
3,Great book to learn about the geisha's life,"I read this book because I've always been intrigued with geishas and wanted to learn more about them. I got what I wanted from ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" in an easy and entertaining reading. This said, what happens to each of the characters made me think of Disney storylines where almost everyone gets what they deserve, and what we hope for. I don't mind simplicity, but too much of the book is like a predictable fable."
5,Like a fairytale..exquisite!,"An absolutly beautiful story looking at not only the pretty painted faces, but the torture as well. So wonderfully written and engrossing. It was the best book I have ever read."
5,Husband and Wife Fought Over This Book,My husband checked this out of the library for a weekend trip we were taking. I started reading it aloud to him while he was driving and became so intrigued that I had to start reading it too. We both had it finished before we returned home from our trip. We were amazed that a man could write such an intricate tale about a girl turning into a woman with the emotion and depth that Arthur S. Golden was able to portray.
2,"Gives the illusion of being deep, but ultimately shallow","I expected to be enthralled. But if you strip away all the cultural details and an occasionally lovely description, this becomes a book about a basically simple-minded woman who spends a lot of time talking about clothes, hair, makeup, and boys. I find it hard to believe that a real geisha, who is trained as an artist and conversationalist, would be this banal. The other characters were also nothing more than skin-deep depictions. Since the book was set in this century, the author had an opportunity to explore any number of interesting juxtapositions: the impact that modern Western culture and technology had on Japan, the way the Japanese were emotionally affected by WWII, ANYTHING that would have caused this book to operate on more than the most superficial level. The book screams ""made-for-TV-movie."""
3,"Worth reading, but not a masterpiece","Memoirs of a Geisha works on some levels more than others; the narrator's climb into fame is chronicled with empathy, and the tale is peppered with interesting details of the time. However, when I finished it, I was left with a feeling of something being incomplete. I felt that the author was cramming the story of the geisha into the confines of a conventional western romance novel. The ending was more like Austen than, say, Tanazaki. There's nothing wrong with Austen at all, but I wasn't exactly expecting _Sense and Sensibility_-esque touches in this particular novel. Also the author's prose didn't have the sparseness that I perhaps expected. Also, the author whisked away the darker side of the geisha world with too much ease, especially with the obsessions of beauty and cruelty. This is a good bedside read but I think it's a little thin for a book discussion group (which is where I encountered it)."
4,"Good, but not great","I couldn't put this book down, but for all the wrong reasons. I kept waiting for Sayuri wake up and realize that Nobu was the ""good guy""."
5,PHENOMENAL!!!,"This book was amazing. The careful detailing of each move and thought of Sayuri was so vivid, it felt as if you were part of her psyche. I could not put this book down. Kudos to Mr. Golden for a well researched and written book."
5,Memorable,"I read a review that said Memoirs of a Geisha is an epic on an intimate scale. That is exactly true. This is a very intimate book, and Golden has done an excellent job of creating a very memorable and lively character in Chiyo. This is the only piece of modern literature I have read that is actually literature - yet it is also a true page-turner. There are faults in the book - the ending seems a bit rushed, and the way the book comes to its climax is so muck like a Dickens novel its almost laughable. But this is the only book I have read in a very long time that truly absorbed me, and I still think about it weeks after i finished it. There are so many things to love about this book, I dare not try and list them for surely i would forget some. Just buy the book and read it, you won't be disapointed."
2,O.K,"I read ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" because of the incredible acclaim of the book. Yet, I feel very unsatisfied with the story and also feel suspicious about the motives of the author. To this day I am not trully sure I know what a Geisha really is. I guess we all need to take this book as a work of fiction and realize that we are viewing the Japanese culture through the eyes of an American author. The book itself was entertaining and should be praised as such, but let's not consider ourselves more informed about the Japanese culture after reading it..."
3,"Great story, bad ending","The book was great up to the ending which wrapped up the story with a neat bow. Yet that was not how the book read. It needed to be tragic, yet the ending was simple. Where was the writers originality!"
3,Fascinating Giesha facts but ultimately mediocre fiction,"The first third of this book promised a wonderful story, but the rest of the book disappointed, as it turned into a primer on geisha life, and the story grew thin and unintersting. As soon as the author reached the ""geisha"" part of his epic, he wandered into a factual textbook on geisha life, just barely maintaining a plot line to justify his sharing of the fascinating cultural experience of geisha life. And while it is indeed fascinating ( I found myself eagerly finishing the book just to learn about this unbelieveable lifestyle) ultimately the writing, story, and conclusions were unsatisfying, poorly written, and unbelieveable. What a shame, as it started with such interesting character development. This is still worth reading, but understand that you are reading for education, not for literary reward."
4,interesting,As I read this book I realized how ignorant I've been both in regard to Geisha culture as well as the intricate workings of Japanese society.
3,I'm pretty sure I liked it...,"I think I liked this book but I'm not completely sure. The book was very detailed and gave me a great insight to the 20-30's Japanese culture, which was very interesting. The plot, however, droned on and on. The ending wasn't the greatest after foraging through so much. I can say I was definitely unsatisfied upon the finishing the book... but I can also say that it was still a good story and great insight to the life of Geisha...You try it out and be the judge!"
5,Couldn't quit thinking about this book!,"Memoirs of a Geisha is one of the best books i've read in awhile. it is a LOVELY story about her love/hate relationship with being a geisha. the book tells about her rise to fame and the people she meets along the way, but in such an eloquent way. you absolutely fall in love with Sayuri and are rooting for her throughout the book. i have recommended this book to so many people. i also gained such an insight on Japanese culture, but all while listening to her tell her story about life in Gion. You laugh with her and cry with her. it is a book i will read again and again.i know that Maneki sued Golden over this book, however the author never claims that this is a true story. he notes that this is a novel, but based upon ideas he learned while speaking to her."
5,I lllllloooooovvvvvveeeee this book!,"It is one of those books that after having read it, you really get a sense of that time and place and are left with a hunger to find out more by going there yourself! I did eventually go to Japan and visit the Gion district with a better understanding and appreciation for its history!"
5,much better than the movie,enchanting.much better than the movie.I read it about 2 years before the movie was made.and of course the movie was disappointing compare to the book.
3,AmosT GooD,"Okay, i gotta say the book was deeply fascinating until the ending. The ending just destroyed the whole geisha affect I thought. I loved the description, i love the way i was drawn into Sayuri's magnificent life but then, the ending just ruined everything. It just shows how american golden is, and it just proves that writers (americans) nowadays must add a bit of their egotism in there. I would have prefered Sayuri to stay in japan. Other than that,I found the book almost astounding, and at times disturbing."
2,Catty and only marginally interesting,"Cat fights set up like Joan Collins versus Linda Evans, brief cultural references, and then back to more back-biting plotting and night time soap stock plots. Two stars only because of some of the facts gleaned. A huge disappointment."
2,Initially interesting with a cliche ending.,I couldn't put it down until I threw it across the room on page 417. What a terrible disappointment!
2,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Not really what I had expected. There were a lot of good reviews for this book, but on the whole it was a disappointment. The book tends to drag on about the girl's life, and at times was lacking the insight that other parts were rich in. You would have to, though, applaud the author's attempt to try to write through the eyes of a young woman. A well written book, nevertheless."
2,It's little me vs. the masses and one very rich Mr. Golden,"Can you argue with money and wicked mad sales? Sure! My boss said, Must read! Must read! And, I did! I did! The opening was beautiful, and then...ZZZZZzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzZZZZZZzzz *clunk* Whah?"
1,It only promotes people's misunderstanding towards Geisha,It only promotes people's misunderstanding/ misimpression towards Geisha.
3,Average work of popular fiction,"I can't jump on the 5 star bandwagon here and say I loved it because I didn't. I thought the book lacked any authentic emotion. The characters were shallow and at the end of the book I didn't care about them. In fact I was relieved to part company with their vapid existence of drinking, gossiping and illicit sexual intrigues. The book so often lapses into ""instruction manual mode"" that it became a tedious read about half-way through. Golden did his research, but meticulous research doesn't necessarily make for a great work of literature. It certainly didn't in this case. The ending was the greatest disappointment. It fell flat with a loud, echoing ""THUD""!"
3,This book could have been great.,"The end was a complete let down. It was almost as if Golden had a limit to the amount of pages he could use and had to tie up the ending really quick. It completely threw off the gentle pace of this book. These types of fast resolutions work well in Hollywood, but leave a reader feeling rooked.To make it worse, I read the entire book under the assumption that it was a real memoir. Although I was suspicious after the wham bam thank you ma'am ending, I was crushed when I realized it was all a fiction.If Spielberg decides to do the movie, I think he will show us just how great this book could have been."
3,Is that all?,"I picked up this book at an airport... perfect inflight entertainment. The book was interesting... a ""glimpse"" into the life of a geisha. However it lacked depth. The author only scratches the surface of the characters, which was a huge disappointment. We now know the mechanics of being a geisha, but the only feeling they seem to have is a sense of fatalism. Not a bad read, but I couldn't help feeling it could have been better."
2,Male Fantasy more than Memoirs of a Geisha,"Arthur Golden did a fine job of researching the life of a Geisha. However, he failed to capture the emotions of Sayuri, the Geisha whose memoirs we are purportedly reading. This novel may be a stereotypically love story if one ignores the age and social status difference between the geisha and her love interest (sponsor). Or it may be a story of abuse of women in Japan. It may even be an outsiders view of what life is like as a geisha. It is not an insider's view of what it feels like to be a geisha as the title implies. Perhaps it is nothing more than a male fantasy."
4,"I am only 12 and I adored the book! So far, of course","I loved this! I am on page 220, and i am adoring this book. Some words are big, some paragraphs are a little too detailed (if you know what i mean) adn it is definatly meant for a more adult audience. i couldn't imagine that life! I especialy loved how Golden added so many differant types of charecters. An awsome book!"
4,Very detailed account of life as a geisha,It is amazing that a man can write something like this and be able to capture a girl/woman so perfectly. The detailed experiences are shocking and interesting. The story seems a bit slow at times but for the majority of the time I couldn't put it down. A definite good purchase.
5,Reflections on Memoirs,"Memiors of a Geisha is a great read. It is the type of book you read and love, but also the type of book you give as a gift. I found Memoirs astonishing in its credibility. After the first few chapters, I completely forgot that it was a work of fiction. It was only when I finished the novel and was confronted with the picture of Arthur S. Golden on the back flap that I realize that I had not just finished an autobiography. Anyway, just wanted to add my two cents to the million other review of this book. =)"
3,"Good details, bad story","I was disappointed by this book. In terms of giving me insights into a geisha's life, I think it delivered. But the plot development was lacking and I could not relate to the main character. The main character falls in love with a chairman after a brief (and I mean, very brief) encounter with him, I mean he doesn't even remember her. She becomes almost obsessed with him and the plot is driven by her quest for his love. Basically, I don't like it that she was into this Cinderella character where everyone around her was either ugly, mean, or vengeful and she was all pure and beautiful. Give me a break. I can't relate to characters like that. They should be flawed, not all self-congratulative, the best in dance, the best in wine pouring, the best this and that. It gets boring after a while. The only I liked were the geisha details, but I'm sure I could have gotten that from another book. It was not worth reading over 500 pages for that in this disappointing book."
3,Pretty Average so far,"I'm about 3/4's of the way through this book, and am slightly disappointed. It's definitely not the kind of book that you can't put down. Nothing very exciting happens. However, it is an interesting view into the life of a Geisha and how the system works. I'm finding Sayuri's constant ""poetic"" comparisions to situations and feelings slightly irriating (can't remember any at present!). So, it is an informative and interesting read so far, but nothing gripping."
5,One of my favorite books!,"This book held my interest more than any book in a long time. Really gives an insite to the Japanese world of Geishas and many other aspects as well. Beautifully written, I was very shocked to find out it is a work of fiction written by a man, though he interviewed former geishas and looked into the subject very much in order to write the book. Even though it is not true memoirs, I still loved it, and highly recommend, can't wait to se the movie!"
2,Cinderella in a Kimono,"The most glaring problem with this book is that Arthur Golden doesn't know the meaning of ""less is more."" Every other paragraph is spent in painful detail, and you flip pages wondering when he's going to get the story back on course. And the story itself is nothing more than a watered-down Cinderella in the Orient: poor girl wins suitor against pathetic odds.This book is terribly predictable. So much time is wasted on insignificant details (like what color stich was on what color kimono or what hair pin was worn on which geisha's head), that the author loses sight of the characters themselves.If detail and dry stories are your thing, this book is perfect; but if you're looking for a good story with solid, well-defined characters, you're better off to look elsewhere."
2,So Slow,This book was so slow. I think only about 1/4 of the book was actually interesting: the first chapter and the last 3 chapters. I was incredibly too long and the story was so drawn out. You think throughout the book there's this big build up and it's finally going to all pay off for the main character and it's just not the best ending at all. There was a big culture gap but the author did make it pretty easy to understand.
1,"silly, sappy drivel","Risking the wrath of those who love this book I have to say...this book is BAD. I felt a bit entertained during some of it but mostly I couldn't wait for it to be over-I only finished it because a friend lent it to me & I felt obligated to slog through it for him.The characters are two-dimensional, predictable and uninteresting. Another reviewer described it accurately as junk literature. This book reads like and has as much depth as one of those dime-a-dozen romance novels or that other really bad bestseller ""Bridges of Madison County"".Your time and money is better spent on popcorn and watching a Gilligan's Island video."
1,A tale of dubious worth,"After the promise of a glimpse into a mysterious and secretive world, the reader is delivered nothing short of a trite tale with dull characters. Ultimately stale (a story you've read a hundred times) and trashy, sorry to say. An easy read, however."
2,Entertaining but Not Historically Accurate,"If I were to rate this book on how entertaining and engaging it is, I would say 4 out of 5 stars. Unforunately, what I was looking for in this book was historically accuracy and correct insight into the Geisha culture. Though I read the book knowing the individual characters and plot were fictional, I expected the culture and major events surrounding the characters to be portrayed as precise in the time period it was to be set in.Do NOT read this book for historically information on Geisha and do NOT hold this book to any truth if you're wanting to study true Geiko life and culture."
4,Memoirs of A geisha,"I am 14 and I have just started reading this book. I am nearly half way through, and I'm fidning it absolutely amazing. It's a wonderful book, and it's one I can somehow relate to. In the smallest way. This book reminds me of a birthday party when I was five, unravelling the parcel, and finding little surprises in each opening. So far, I am thoroughly enjoying the book."
2,Huh?,"So many people liked this book that I couldn't wait to curl up with it. However, I kept scratching my head when the plot was trite and too many thin similies were used. As for showing the world of the geisha, I was most intrigued by Hatsumomo and Mamaha but still felt these characters were not built to my satisfaction; the bad cop was too bad and the good cop was too good. It was Mr. Golden's first effort and unfortunately completes my experience for this author. I felt like it was basically a harlequin romance veiled as a high-brow novel."
2,Not my cup of saki,I am just astonished at all the wonderful reviews for this book. I had to read Memoirs for my Book club and I say HAD because I'm sure I wouldn't've finished it otherwise. I just didn't find it beautifully written as others did; I guess I read too many really well written novels. The rivalry of women in Japan was hard to read about as was the control of the men. I suppose Golden did a good job conveying the culture of Japan but I like characters who have some redeeming qualities or that I can care about and I didn't find any here.
2,Missed the boat,"Sometimes I really wonder what attracts readers and generates best sellers. The first half of this novel, admittedly, was engrossing as we learn of the intimate details in the life of a pre-war geisha and come to know Sayuri and her struggles to find meaning to her life. But its all down hill after that, and it would have served the author well to quit right there as he seems to have run out of steam and relied on the contrived Hollywood ending allowing Sayuri to fall into the arms of her long-time idol, whom we actually know nothing about (except for one sentence that says he is married!) and live happily ever after jet-setting between Japan and New York. You spend 400 pages getting to know her only to find out that she is a big disappointment.Was this maybe the intent?"
2,"IN A WORD - ""DISAPPOINTING!""","This book got me all steamed up enough to write a review! I suppose anyone would if they had believed in all the hype and walked away with a copy in hand and high expectations. Very very light reading. One dimensional, lacking insights to a people and a culture. Doesn't even compare with a paperback romance novel if you are looking for substance. Hiding behind a woman's persona, a geisha in this case, the author's glossy treatment of characters are insufferable. Truly lacking the nuances of relationships between people and social norms of a culture that would give understanding or the very least some insight. Very flimsy, save your $7 or $14 or whatever it is."
2,Be advised this book is FICTIONAL!!,"This book is very easy reading. I could not help but laugh at some of the remarks only a Yank woman would say. As if the author had no idea about their language. I have read other Geisha books, studied Japanese and know people who live in Kyoto. This book is very American it's no wonder all the mindless Yanks love it!! It is a wonderful story no doubt of the struggle of a young ""Geisha"" woman. I read it in 5 days. It was a nice change. It's almost the same as if a Geisha would read ""Hollywood Wives"". It's almost laughable. The whole Chairman ordeal was very tiring. And Hautsumono's character was eliminated too easily and without a boom. In fact the story was not even about Geisha at all. Only about 2 women trying to bring another down for treating one of them so badly. Sounds like elementary reading."
4,Spurred me on,I love it when a book proves to be so interesting that I continue after reading it to find out more about the subject. This is one such book. A really good read--not easy to put down.
2,DULL,Don't believe the hype on this one. This novel reads like it was written by a North American man trying to imitate Danielle Steele. The heroine remains devoted to a man who gave her a handkerchief; she betrays the man who truly loves her; she sees men only as instruments to her own ends. She comes across as a vacuous shallow person and she's one of the better written characters. Don't waste your time with this book - there must be better ways to learn about Japan.
2,"Disappointing; should have been called ""Memoir of a Bore""","While Mr. Golden's prose holds up pretty well after 400+ pages, the story of Chiyo/Sayuri, the geisha, does not. For a memoir (fictional or not) to be worthwhile, the subject must have led an interesting life. While the portrait of the geisha 'trade' and life in Japan during the period treated is certainly interesting, the experiences of our heroine are pretty dull.Yes, there are personal rivalries, power grabs, and lots of emotion. But frankly, other than the unorthodox setting (the Gion district of Kyoto), there's nothing compelling about this story. After 250 pages it dawned on me that geisha are, in fact, prostitutes (consider the relationship between a geisha and her 'danna') despite everyone's claims that there is somehow something more subtle and nuanced about their profession.Left me disappointed."
2,"novel, or movie script?","Well, I understand why they picked this up as a movie now. I received this book as a gift and have to say I was a bit disappointed. The story was captivating, really...but also a bit contrived. It was not especially well written. I continued to read it only to find out if it ended how I though it might...and it did. Perfect for a box-office hit!To be fair, Golden did an amazing job with his research. I am not an expert on pre-WWII Geishas, but the details felt authentic, and I did learn a thing of two about this fascinating culture."
2,Memoirs of a G,"Just didn't do it for me.Romantic story? I don't find old desperate men swooning over a girl who's paid to be with them particularly enchanting..Evidently Geisha's become skilled at the art of manipulating people... particularly men... in order to get what they want. The best are described as skilled conversationalists.... at least in in the genre of locker room gossip stories.Its difficult to sympathize with the so called heroine in any way... from willing to sleep with the minister to get what she wants (or doesn't) ... to a lack of recognition that her sister worked as a prostitute... to her materialistic preoccupation for her clothing, kimono's and appearance. Supposed to be a happy ending, but I feel sorry for her...Admittedly, the Japanese perspective and conditions during the 2nd world war was interesting at times ... and there is some value put on knowing what a Giesha really is. Overall, I slogged through the whole book, rarely interested in reading the next page."
4,Something Different,"After hearing and reading nothing but wonderful reviews of this book, I purchased it second hand and began reading right away. The author quickly envelops the reader into Japanese society and customs circa 1920s. While at time the poetry of the author's writing style can get a bit long, it enrichens the book as a whole. I found myself staying up until 4am flipping through page after page wondering who would be her danna, what would happen with Hatmumomo,and how she climbed her way to be a respected geisha. This is clearly a book that needs to be read before the movie is released and I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys Japanese culture and history. If I ever I visit Japan and see a geisha, I'll instantly think of Sayuri."
4,A delightful book with deep understanding of hidden Geishas,"I have recently read in the Far Eastern Economic Review, that Arthur Golden the author of Memoirs of a Geisha is being sued by Mineko Iwasaki. Iwasaki claimed that she welcomes Golden with open arms and explained to him about the world of Geisha off the records. However, Arthur published this book not long after. I have seriously and thoroughly enjoyed the book. It has thought me about the ways, hardships, and gave me understanding about the Geisha clan. Iwasaki also mentioned in the article that Golden had painted wrong pictures of Geishas to readers. I, however, found the book has thought me to think of Geisha in new light and also brighter light. Though the figures in the book are made up, the settings of the Geisha clan and the ways of Geisha are well carried across to readers. The main character, Nitta Sayuri aka Chiyo-san, was a strong character and with lots of quality that one can admire and develop respect for."
3,"Good Story, If Somewhat Contrived","Memoirs of a Geisha's strengths are its story and the window it opens on the world of the geisha, which is fascinating. At times the story seems a little contrived and the use of language gratingly coarse. But still, the plot and first person narrative keeps you turning the pages."
5,"Classic Tale of Struggle, Love and Triumph",This was one of the best books I have ever read. It has everything that appeals to a reader inside. The use of words describes the setting and makes you feel like you are in the story itself!
5,Beautifully written,I had heard so many good things about this book and I decided to read it even though I felt I would be deceived as I had high expectations... I was amazed at how well this book was written and how meticulous Arthur Golden was in describing Japanese art and Geishas... I was stunned that an American man could depict such a beautiful story and be so sensitive. I was impressed. It is the most beautiful book I have ever read and is a favorite.
5,An instant classic !!,"I read this book a year ago and ive been obsessed since the book is stunning i couldnt believe that a man (a young one at that!) could write like this it was astounding! this book is one of the best books i have ever read i found my copy at a second hand book shop down south and when i got back home i had to buy the hardcover i also bought liza dalby's book ""geisha"" and it was also very good but could not compare to ""memoirs"" i also bought a large book of pictures also the name escapes me though ? this book is a classic and will be loved for many years to come my favourite chapter by far would have be 27 it had such an eerie feel to it....but it was a great book and i hope everyone will enjoy as much as i did"
4,"Loved the book, not the ending","This is one of my most favorite books of all times. I believe it will one day be considered a classic. The author draws you in from the first sentence, and the book is hard to put down. However, as much as I loved this book, the ending is not my favorite. I believe the author goes against Sayuri's true character at the end of the book in her treatment of Nobu. Read the book and you will understand."
4,Probably 4/5 Stars,A truly fantastic book but it did take me a while to get into it. After the first 50 or so pages though I couldn't bare to put it down! A book I think which teaches you alot about Japanese culture and how lonely it could be.
5,A Gripping tale,"This fiction is written in a style that makes you feel as if you are watching history unfold. Arthur has managed to use his years of Japanese history to adequately portray the young japanese spirit of a geisha. This story is amazing and is a must read that is impossible to put down once you begin on its magical journey. It is a tale of personal growth, and personal power. Life through the eyes of a geisha is a unique perspective you share as its reader."
1,Gimme A Break,"I had heard a lot about this book. From the public, I heard nothing but good things. From my mom, she said drastically overrated. So I read for myself. <insert a HUGE yawn here> The characters had about as much flavor as water, and they could quench anything. This sort of thing happens all the time in any country. Don't waste your time. Read a Japenese business strategy book before this one. Moral: Always listen to Mom!"
4,Memoirs of Geisha,I purchased this book from C.Vander Ven. The book was in good condition. It is a really good book that I have enjoyed reading immensely.
5,A Great Read,"Thoroughly engaging historical novel (??) based on scholarly research and insights into Japanese culture you won't find anywhere. And you don't have to read it for all the interesting detail it contains-you can't help but read this book and learn what an erroneous stereotype most Westerners have of Geishas as some kind of prostitute-which, by the way, they are not.A great read, one I couldn't put down!"
4,Interesting Reading,"It was a little difficult to get into this book in the beginning, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed the detail that was given on the life and clothing of the geisha."
3,"Beautiful prose, flawed plot","A beautifully written novel. However, the lyrical nature of the text does not make up for the flawed plot - throughout most of the book she is ""in love"" or ""obsessed"" with one man that she had a chance encounter with when she was 10(?) years old...found it difficult to believe that she could carry a torch for so many years for someone she met once as a child.The item that really got me was her absolute betrayal of Nobu in the end. Yeah, she eventually got what she wanted, but she had to sell her soul to get it.All in all, I'd have to say the way she turns out in the end left me feeling a bit down."
4,Definitely Worth Reading,"This book was easy to read and kept me turning the pages. I personally did not agree with the ending, and wished it would have ended differently but will not put any spoilers out there :)Definitely worth reading :)"
5,Amazing novel,This is not the kind of book that I really thought that I would enjoy. I picked it up at the airport for a long trip. I could not put this book down. It was fantastic!!! Highly recommended
5,"Shocking, fascinating, gripping","I don't think I knew enough about Japanese culture, and this well-written, beautifully depictive novel certainly paints a picture that fills that void very well."
3,More than a good summer read--quite a history lesson.,"As I followed Sayuri through her challenges and obstacles I grew to know a strong character but, even more so, learned of a culture and lifestyle I knew little about. I found this book to be very well written, witty, and direct. My only disappointment was in the ending which took on a fairy tale element and seemed rather unrealistic."
3,"Engaging description, yet hollow content","I found the writing and the plot of this novel to be quite lovely and engaging. However, I was very disappointed by the ending. The main character has lived her entire life for a man and has taken no pride in her great accomplishment as a sucessful geisha. She claims to have lived in misery before getting the Chairman, yet she lived a very pampered life throughout the depression while others suffered poverty and starvation. She has suffered and overcome so much, yet she only claims sucess for herself when she betrays the man who was kindest to her and becomes the mistress of a man who is way to old for her anyway."
4,"Wonderful Read, Dissappointing End","This book had me gripped up until the last 10 pages, one of the most crucial areas for any book to hold the reader. And it failed! Oh, Lord...But first. We begin with a beautiful story that is one part history, one part mystical exploration of Japan. The culture of the geisha is rich and beautiful, full of ritual and custom, and you learn so much fromt his one novel! From the concepts of karma, to superstition, to the roles of men and women and the adapation of Japan from backwater nation to powerful, modern entity.And it's a good read. It grips you and holds you; Chiyo -- who becomes Sayuri -- is a fascinating character with both virtues and flaws. However, he desires, in the end, damn the book to a rushed ending. I would get it for the read--but know you will probably be dissappointed in the end. It would be a five star book, easily, if the ending would have been less rushed and contrived."
4,Interesting trip to another culture and time,"""Memoirs"" takes the reader to another world that few know of, and even fewer could tell of as well as Golden has. Now that I am done with the novel, I want to learn more about the geisha.I look forward to Steven Spielberg's film adaptation."
3,"Light entertaining fun, but ultimately not compelling","I enjoyed reading this book in the same way that one might enjoy watching the TV movie of the week. It was fun and provided the opportunity to learn more about Japanese culture and the life of a geisha. However, I felt somewhat cheated by the hollowness of her romantic attachment to the Chairman and by the lack of any serious questioning of the values of the geisha herself."
1,"Here's the real story, a lot better than Golden's made up one","I felt so ripped off reading a story written by Arthur Golden that he supposedly got from a ""real"" Geisha.. (A man writing about a woman's profession should have been a red flag to me right away) But then find out he embellished and wasn't even writing a true account at all.. Mineko Iwasaki's book (the woman he ripped off) does tell the real story and it's a shame he twisted her words. I wonder if she won the lawsuit against him... And also can't believe how boring and unrealistic the film was that was made about this book."
3,"Interesting, but not Engaging","I completed reading this book a few days ago & enjoyed reading the story of how one geisha became to be, as it is a mysterious culture of historically rich Japanese society. However, I was never really emotionally attached to the storytelling. The book reads like a man telling the story of a woman as she reflects on her experience. Additionally, with respect to the story, I'm not insensitive to her childhood situation and understood her eventual acceptance to want to become a geisha/party-girl/mistress versus the alternative, while discovering an object for her affection in a loveless profession. But I did grapple with my monogamous American female values which conflict with My-greatest-aspiration-in-life-is-to-be-your-concubine status.I'm not saying I agree with the character, but I certainly understand her need to convert chicken sh*t into chicken salad."
1,Misinformation according to Mineko Iwasaki,When you read about Mineko Iwasaki's reaction to this book you are thrown so off center. How do I get dreamy and absorbed in a book when the principal source says the author got it wrong and is left angered. Reading this story now will be like walking on a rotted floor--- you just don't know where the holes are.
4,Amazing,"A great book, amazingly well written. It takes you into a world of reality, and at times you don't even know it is fiction. The book is great and beautifully detailed, the reader can almost picture exactly what is going on. Full of vibrant information that keeps you reading. I love the book and can't wait to read another one byArthur Golden."
3,Review of Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden.,"When I came to the end of this book I felt cheated. I didn't realise until the end that this book was a novel. The error was my own but the title and the introduction (named by the author as Translator's Notes) created and maintained the deception. It reads like a biography and, perhaps, in that form, one could excuse the shallow characterisation. At times the writing is long-winded. As a male I found some of the long detailed descriptions of the dress and make-up of the geisha to be tedious. However, despite my disappointment, the novel gives an apparently authentic view into the life of geisha and is an easy and diverting read. I would not rate it as fine writing or profound literature but nevertheless, a good book for a wet holiday weekend or a long aeroplane journey."
3,"An interesting story, but told in a stilted manner.","While Golden has come up with an interesting story, there is much that is repetitive in this tale of a geisha's development and tribulations. I also found many of the characters lacked complexity, and the twists and turns of the story quite predictable."
3,Good factual account but not good fiction.,"MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is a compelling read, but it lacks crucial elements of good fiction. Golden writes a well-researched factual account lacking in characterization, plot and emotion. As such, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA would have been better written as a non-fictionalized account. Perhaps we can count on a quality film adaptation to fill in the imagination and emotion the novel lacks."
5,A Beautiful story about a beautiful culture,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully written book. It is sensuous and utterly feminine, and delves into a culture that is mysterious and yet fascinating. That Arthur Golden is not Japanese nor a woman is a real testiment to his writing abilities. I cannot wait for Mr. Golden's next book. I LOVED THIS BOOK."
5,"Enthralling, entertaining....couldn't put it down","Couldn't believe this book was written by an American Man!!! Arthur Golden captures the essence of Sayuri. You can see her, feel her emotions. You are taken in by his poetic writing. Not only do you get a chance to share the twists and turns of Sayuri's life, but you are given an opportunity to learn ancient customs and way of life for the geisha of Japan. I really loved this book!!!"
4,Wonderfully unique,"This was a wonderfully unique reading that kept me on edge most of the time. The subject matter as well as the history left me hungry for more. Already head first into Eastern literature this was certainly a tantilizing taste (even if it did come from a Westerner). What does this say to us feminists? How accurate is this, I ask myself?"
2,A Geisha's life drawn out,"The life of Sayuri as a geisha in Japan could have been told in a more efficient and effective manner. I felt that the story had been ""padded"" to lengthen the book, dragging out seemingly insignificant happenings that did nothing to enhance the story. However, I did learn more about the Japanese and their ideas regarding the place of women in their culture."
5,Could not put this down,This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time. I loved it and just could not put it down. I learnt a lot - i thought a geisha was just a prostitute - and really cared about the characters. Excllent.
5,A Beautifully Told and Wonderfully Written Story.,"Memoirs of a Geisha, by Arthur Golden, is a beautifully told and wonderfully written story. It is the story of a young Japanese girl who is innocently and unknowingly thrust into the secretive world of the Geisha. Golden's writing the story in the narration of the main character is so abosrbing, it's as if he he has given us a driect light into the mind and thoughts of the characters he so colorfully describes ..."
4,Very interesting and a definate page turner,I enjoyed reading this novel immensly. Definatly provides a cultural insight into Japanese traditions. I found it interesting that a Westerner could depict the feelings of a young geisha (who is forced into the trade) with such precision. A very captivating book which makes you fume with rage at some of the injustice that Sayuri <--(I'm not sure if I spelt that right) has to tolerate. While in the process of reading it I thought about nothing except getting back to the book until I finally finished it. Only after I reflected on the reality I was slightly perplexed. The ending seems unprobable and questionable - overall a good read.
2,Not the tour-de-force the literary reviewers claimed.,"This book is easy to read, and at times the prose is delicate and provocative. But ultimately, the thin characterizations (and absence of motivation for any of the characters), and our heroine's complete lack of an inner life--she goes through life with blinders on, never learning, never changing, never growing--damage this book. I never thought of our narrator as ""female""; she seemed sexless, and she often reacted to things like a man. Arthur Golden, despite the reviews, failed to find a woman's voice and sensibility in which to tell his tale. I found ""Memoirs"" superficial and frustrating; I forced myself through to the contrived ending. Golden is an able enough writer; he's just shallow. We've all been duped by great reviews garnered because the subject matter is unusual and exotic. I'm glad I borrowed a friend's copy and didn't buy it!"
5,Takes you in,"I loved this book. I was totally emmersed. After I read it, I felt myself more conscious of my movements and the words I said. Chiyo takes you into her worlds and your eyes are opened to the secret life of a geisha. I definitely recommend this book!"
4,Buy this book. you'll love it!,"I picked up this book after a difficult read and could not put it down. The culture, the history and the story were unforgettable. I have recommended it to friends and everyone agrees. Follow Chiyo through her life and enjoy the story."
2,"""Restless Hearts""","""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a (mostly) critically and popularly acclaimed novel, marketed as a top-notch piece of ""historical fiction."" For that reason, I purchased a copy and read it through to its end. I wish, however, this book had been entitled ""Restless Hearts"" (or something similar), as I then would have understood that what I was about to read was actually a romance novel with a ""historical"" setting. As to how accurate the novel is in portraying the lives of WWII-era Geisha, I cannot say, as I am neither Japanese, nor a Geisha, nor a WWII-era Japanese Geisha historian. But even assuming that Golden gets his history right, his book is still filled with two-dimensional characters, adolescent themes, and bad plot contrivances. I give it two stars because I enjoyed the writing style. But a well-written book does not necessarily make the story within worth reading."
5,very good,i read this book and i loved it. i really couldnt stop reading. the movie was amazing also. i recomend the book and the movie definatly!
3,"Interesting, but clunky","Cultural lessons were interesting, but maybe I could have learned more from a non-fiction? Some times the book was abortively didactic. In any case, I found some original metaphors which seemed authentically Japanese in their nature (from my point of view at least). Plot basic. Tie-up illogical. No way, or else Sayuri would have been rescued about the time of the wrestling match or before."
3,Read the first two-thirds....,"I have to agree with one of the L.A. reviewers. This novel started out as a tight, intriguing, well-paced story that absolutely unraveled by the end. I was left feeling that Golden needed to wrap things up, almost as if he had become bored by his own characters and wanted to dispense with the story as quickly as possible. The novel's pace completely changed, characters became caricatures, and the whole subplot about the Chairman fulfilled itself in the most ridiculous way. After raving about this novel for two days while I read the first two-thirds, I had to admit to my friends that I couldn't ultimately recommend it. I'm glad I waited until it came out in paperback."
4,Soothing for the mind and soul.,"Mr Golden is a master of minutiae. His paragraphs drip with rich detail which are a delight to the senses. You can almost taste the Japanese tea and visualise the exquisite kimono designs.A possible weakness is that a good two thirds of the book deals with the truly epic 'bitch fight' between protagonist Sayuri and gorgon Hatsumono, complete with torn kimonos and frazzled hair buns. While this big sister/small sister thang is jolly good fun, Golden could have fleshed out other characters such as the shadowy Chairman or events such as those in the post War period.It is commendable that Golden has presented to us a little known aspect of an Asian culture in such an accessible format. He has undertaken a huge amount of research for this story and one hopes he uses his collected information as the impetus for another great story."
5,"Real Woman, Real Feelings","Sayuri - as her name makes her who she is - is a phenomonal character! Whether she is Chiyo, the ignorant child,or Sayuri, the all too mature adult, I felt as though she was telling her story to me in the privacy of her own tea room. This is a fantastic read for anyone who wants to escape the pressures of ""the real world"" for Sayuri's challenging world of geishas."
2,Arthur Golden fantasizes,"This book is a page-turner. I can't speak to its cultural accuracy, but in the context of the novel it was very convincing. What ruined the book was its ending. I won't give it away, but will say that the ending was wrong, wrong, wrong - it completely didn't fit the main character. The ending just confirmed that the author, despite his writing skill, was a man who can't really imagine what it is to be female, or what would really make this geisha happy. It is so sad that a writer with this much talent buys the Hollywood image of women as shallow. The book would have been so much better without the cliched, unbelievable, storybook ending!"
4,Enoyable... despite the ending,"Engrossing, captivating, extremely descriptive, I finished ""Memoirs"" in 8 hours. A fascinating story which takes you away, but the Hollywood-style ending didn't fit with the first three quarters of the book. I was left wanting something more substantial. Did the author stop caring, get bored, or find something else to do? The whole thing with the Chairman came off as just too convenient. I think this book would make for a good summer read and I'd recommend it to friends - but probably with a caveat or two."
5,"Amazing, fluid depiction","Yes, I am one of over 1,000 to review this fabulous book! I was so enthralled by every word. The flowing descriptions of the life of a geisha were unbelievable. If only my review could be so eloquent. It was possibly one of the best books I have ever read. I feel a sense of sorrow to have finished it."
5,Every Book Club Should Read,Powerful story.The geisha experience is captured so masterfully is this book. I learned a lot about the culture and thoroughly enjoyed the sotryline. It's a good group read because of all the many events that took place and you can interpret in different ways. Definitely a page turner.Would recommend over and over.
4,Very interesting look at geisha life,"I thumbed through this book at the bookstore for almost a year before I finally borrowed it from the library...and then regretted having waited so long to experience this interesting story. Golden follows the life, love and intrigue of Sayuri, a poor Japanese girl basically sold into the geisha profession in the 1920s. Golden spent 10 years researching the geisha culture, and breaks many Western stereotypes of the profession while being praised for his ability to capture Japanese culture so innately."
4,"Great, Interesting Read",I enjoyed reading this book for the story as much as I did to learn more about old Japan and how a geisha really lived her life. You can tell the author did a ton of research in writing this and I did enjoy the story line.
4,love it,what more can i say - heart breaking and heart warming at the same time.i really love this story.
5,Simply Wonderful!,"I must agree the title is not appealing to me at all. But when i sat down and read, i slowly drift into the story itself. I felt as if I am Suriya's friend, seeing her through her life. I simply cant leave the book alone. Very well-written!"
3,Plain Story Telling,"Credits to Golden as a westerner to portrait a geisha's life and thinking. I would give a B+ to that respect. Good attempt at portraiting life of Japanese at war, but not in-depth enough. Good job in the creation of Chiyo and Sayuri - From the book I can feel the transformation of the child into a woman through her conversation. I do enjoy the first part of the book better. As to storyline, it's a bit to long winded after Chiyo becomes Sayuri, the real Geisha. I am having a hard time finishing the last part of the book (still have 20 pages to go) As a book I expect more depth and literature touch. Reading the book gives me the feeling of watching a Japanese soap opera."
5,Engrossingly Beautiful!,"This is by far the best book I have read in a long time. The story gives you a window into so many worlds, not just Giesha culture but Japanese culture, war, slavery and triumph."
5,I have a new insight of the life of women in other cultures!,"Wow!! What a fabulous book. I want to read more about the Geisha's of Japan, and the stories they have to share. How fortunate we are to have choices that these women were never given!"
3,"Fun, easy read. Well-written.","It's hard to give this book just 3 stars. Maybe it's a 4. I have really enjoyed reading it (in 4 days) and it's hard to put down. I am not sure why the other readers are so hard against it. Of course it's fiction, but it's very interesting. Give it a try!"
2,Dissapointing view of life of a geisha in japan,"The subject matter of this novel is extremely intriguing. Therefore, it is all the more dissappointing in the telling. The author can't capture the voice of his title character. She is precious and undeveloped. There is very little tension or psychological revelation in the telling. This is an overhyped book, ripe for the Steven Spielberg treatment."
5,Enchanting!,"An absolute must for holiday traveling. Sayuri's story unfolds gently, affording the reader an evolving awareness of a lost cultural heritage. The pace is far from slow, however, with an engaging story-telling style and unique characters that keep pages turning. Although the story spans a lifetime, Golden has captured the essence of his character as she develops from a child, to a young woman and through adulthood. While some subplots and characters leave you aching for more development, the total work is engaging. A definite must read!"
4,"Hard to Start, but Loved the Second Half","I found this book difficult to get into in the beginning. It was different than what I normally read and interesting, yet not engaging. About 1/3 to half way through, though, I found myself really involved in the storyline and the characters. Very well researched, interesting characters, a lot of emotion. I definitely recommend it."
3,Typical stereo typing of asian male,"Goldens story, Memoirs of a Geisha, has very beautiful sentences and descriptive passages. The problem with the book is that not one Asian male in the book is interested in anything other than money and sex. Sure, the chairman gave her a hanky to dry her tears and money for an ice cream, but why... Well, turns out later he wants to ""help"" the little girl become a great geisha. Arthur, stretch yourself, you could have had one decent asian male in the book. This is a time for bringing the world together not a time to flame the fires of prejudice and unreasonable bias."
4,An excellent read for the connoissuer of Japan.,"A fictional piece that chronicles the life of geisha Nitta Sayuri. Born in Yoride, a fishing village on Japan's east coast, around 1920, she was sold to Gion in Kyoto as an apprentice geisha. The memoires are alleged to have been recorded in Sayuri's New York appartment over a period of two years in the 1990's. Golden provides us with an account of the mysterious life a geisha leads at the height of its popularity before WWII, the way it survived during the Great Depression and its temporary closure near the end of the war. The Western perception of this antiquated art form is largely mistaken and we are provided with an explanation that is both harsh and forgiving. Golden is a Japanophile and his research has produced a novel that is enjoyable and eye opening. I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in Japanese culture and/or is intending to visit Japan."
5,Interesting cultural information and intriging plot,"I enjoy this book immensely, great view into an unreachable world. Scary and intriguing. Golden writes so convincingly in the voice of a geisha it makes for a wonderful novel."
2,Boring,"The girl at the bookstore said she and all her friends just loved it. Was hoping for something alone the lines of Shogun. Wasn't Shogun. Didn't love it. Was tempted to stop reading several times, but hoped it would improve. It took so long to get where it was going. I did learn about the life of a Geisha, but would have preferred something richer. The men, even the Chairman, were mostly jerks and so immature. Drinking contests! The word ""love"" was never mentioned. I would have run away, for sure."
4,Read it and Weep!,"I would compare this to Amy Tan's books, although not quite as good. Arthur Golden gives terrific details into the life of Sayuri a Geisha living in Gion, the Geisha capital of Japan in the early/mid 1900's. The reader gets and inside view of a Geisha's life. Pretty it isn't. His details on a Geisha's clothing, etiquette, and day-to-day lives are quite vivid and the reader has no problem visualizing Sayuri's cruel lot in life. The book is quite sentimental and has moments of triteness, but I would recommend it for it's desriptive details of a Geisha's life. However, if you are interested in Japanese historical fiction I would also recommend James Clavell's Shogun - one of my alltime favorites!!"
1,The emperess is not wearing any clothes,"Note to self: never ever read a book about a woman coming of age - written by a man. The story (was there a story?) plodded along like a sea tortoise - yes, that's the type of lyrical imagery one can expect from Golden. The characters are two-dimensional, stereotypical, and completely uninteresting. I've read romance novels better written than this. The true crime is that Golden has taken a potentially fascinating woman, situation, and era - and rendered it as dry as parchment paper. If it's true Steven Spielberg has optioned this book for the big screen, I predict major rewrites. Read ""The Red Tent"" instead."
2,Unintended humour?,"Too bad we do not have novels written by geishas or meikosan about the life of an American male writer at the turn of the century. They would be almost as good fun as Memoirs of a geisha.It deserves however two stars because the author made his homework, and the book is indeniably well-researched - even though as many native English speakers he probably never even bothered to learn the language. Only, as far as I can tell, most geishas, including contemporary ones, and their male friends, including European ones, would think that he has understood little of his findings and of Japanese culture in general."
3,Jane Eyre goes to Japan,"Little orphan girl is mistreated, has many mis-adventures and then ends up with the man of her dreams, of course, he is greatly diminished and they grow old together after finding and losing each other. And guess what, she bears him a child. She lives happily ever after taking care of him. Exuse me - the only thing missing is the insane wife. Hatsomomo will do for that. And the war will fill in the rest of the blanks. Blind - well that works too - remember it was only temporary in the original."
2,"A smooth read, predictable plot","I don't understand the hype about this book. Yes, it's well written, but, as many of its critics have pointed out, the turns of plot and characterization are weak and uneventful. For the first two-thirds of the book we follow the plight of poor Sayuri up until her twenties; the last third wraps up her life, racing through WWII and the American occupation. A pleasant read, but I won't be pushing it on anyone."
3,Interesting,"When I first picked up this book and read it a few years ago, I was captivated. I simply could not put the book down. I was drawn into the life of the fictonal geisha Sayuri, and her life and trials. I thought the world of a geisha fascinating! I read it over and over again, and had to buy a second copy as the first got worn out.Then I read ""Geisha: A Life"" by Mineko Iwasaki, whom Arthur Golden had interviewed. I was shocked. I come to find out the inaccuracies in ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", and how it wasn't an accurate representation of a geisha's life. Mr. Golden obviously needed to do more research, or listen more closely to what Ms. Iwasaki told him.Bottom line, if you're looking for an interesting story, by all means. But if you're looking for something a little more accurate, please read the aforementioned book."
2,not authentic,"sorry, i did not feel the voice was very authenticfirst, a man wrote thisfrom a woman's perspectivewho is not a japanese personnor was ever a geishamaybe it was a mental thingbut i felt the voice did not ring trueas a result, the story did not resonate with meand there is not one image that i can recall to this daywhen i forget something, i call it my ""geisha"" momentXP"
1,this book was soooooo bad,"This was the most boring book I have ever read. The most amazing thing about the book was the fact that someone would actually write it. I mean how many times can you go into the way some woman bats her eyes at a man. Ridiculous. Who CARES???? If this is your idea of an interesting book, then you would be easily entertained by a farmer's ""compelling tale of sheep blisfully munching on green pastures.""Sure, you feel sorry for the main character. She has a horrible chilhdood. And sure, it nicely depicts the milieu of her society. But then the book goes on and on about ways and means of handling men. And that's it. I say thumbs down!"
5,Entertaining,"The story is exciting, takes you into a different world, colorful and dramatic, I love the ending, if you like tradition, culture, and being entertained this is a book to read"
